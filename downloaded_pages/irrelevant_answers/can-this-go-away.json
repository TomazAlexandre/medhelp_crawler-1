            "answer": "Surgeon has kindly shared his thoughts in his comments below and I agree with his assessment.If the diagnosis is truly gastroparesis, there are several medications that you may want to discuss.\u00a0\u00a0Intravenous erythromycin is the treatment of choice for patients who cannot take oral medications, while cisapride is the drug of choice for those who can ingest oral liquids, although its availability is severely restricted in the United States.Reglan and Domperidone (this is not available in the United States) are also medications to consider.\u00a0\u00a0More experimental treatments have used botulinum toxin injection.\u00a0\u00a0I would discuss all these options with your personal gastroenterologist.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "It's possible that the vagus nerves, which control muscular action of the stomach, as well as influencing acid production, could have been injured during the fundoplication. That could cause gastroparesis. If so, it's possible it will gradually improve, assuming the nerves weren't totally cut. There are two main trunks, and it would be extra rare for both to be cut. There are ways to test for function of the vagus nerves. It could take many months to improve, if that's the cause...up to a year or more. I'd be optimistic that it will get better. Meanwhile, if you aren't already on it, reglan (metoclopromide) can help a lot.",
