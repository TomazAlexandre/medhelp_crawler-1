            "answer": "No offense, but your doctor sounds like an idiot. That's his diagnosis: Eat more frequently?? Something is obviously wrong. It could possibly be hypoglycemia or diabetes. Weight loss is not necessarily a symptom, especially of Type 2 Diabetes. Random blood sugar tests are virtually meaningless. He needs to do an A1C which is a test of the average of your blood sugars for the last couple months. If it is not hypoglycemia or diabetes then you need a doctor who will help you figure out what else it might be.",

            "answer": "Once again Zoelula has provided excellent commentary. Especially in noting that random blood sugar tests are meaningless.Needless to say, you must endeavor to lose weight.Easier said than done, I know.I would suggest a general work-up with an enchronologist, who can determine if your weight gain is due to a metabolic issue. Not just a thyroid test. You have to get some of those pounds to disappear.And, of course, a screen for diabetes.",

    "question": "23yr female 194lbs takes medicationI have had these concerning symptoms for about a month, and they are becoming more frequent, and I don't see the connection.On occasion I become dizzy, I shake, i'm out of it (unable to complete simple tasks, or focus) I get really agitated, and panicked. This includes body temprature rising suddenly sweaty hands, and feeling the need to run. I feel like i'm going to faint, but not because of blood pressure like a head rush, more like go unconsious.These symptoms are either proceeded by:a) physical activity (cardio) 30 mins- 1hr. Extreme hunger, but at the same time a jittery stomach and the feeling I would throw up if I ate.b) having lunch up to an hour before.I always get these after physical activity. But, I only get these symptoms occasionally after I eat. I thought It would be my blood sugar, but reading about diabetes, It just cant be right. I'm not losing weight.I have had my thyroid checked at its within normal range. I had a random blood glucose test with 3.9mmol/LWhere should I start looking? My doctor had no diagnosis, other than eat more frequently. All of this makes losing weight really hard, if not impossible.",
