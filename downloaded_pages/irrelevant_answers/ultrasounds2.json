I have a 3d/4d one Friday but the doc is just doing that one for fun. To get the right answer,\u00a0\u00a0just ask your doctor,\u00a0\u00a0because every doctor and insurance is different. If I have gestational diabetes, I'll probably get another one.\u00a0\u00a0Your doc will let you know,\u00a0\u00a0but you most likely won't get another one after the anatomy scan,\u00a0\u00a0unless the doctor sees a reason to give you one",
