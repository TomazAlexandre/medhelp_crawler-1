            "answer": "I can certainly understand you're being worried. I would encourage him to drink a lot of water and to limit his carb intake (such things as pasta, bread, sweets, rice, cereal) as much as he can which will help keep his blood sugar down. He should be ok until 7/27. Here is the only exception: If he starts to have symptoms similar to the flu with vomiting then he needs to go to the ER right away because hw would have something called DKA which is a medical emergency. Let us know how he does. If he is not overweight, or has lost weight, is on the young side or has other autoimmune conditions you will want the doctor to do testing to see if he is type 1 or type 2. But for now hang in there, diabetes is a scary diagnosis but is a manageable condition. There is a lot to learn. When he is diagnosed you might want to send me a private message and I'll give you another website with lots of diabetics who can share information and support. Best of luck to you.",

We have tons to learn - thank you!",

    "question": "On July 13, my husband had fasting bloodwork done at his cardiologist's office. On Tuesday, July 20, he was told his blood sugar was 312.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't go back to see the doctor until this coming Tuesday, July 27.\u00a0\u00a0I'm very concerned - he is taking nothing to control his blood sugar, so will it continue to climb? He has not been diagnosed diabetic (I assume that's coming this Tuesday!), but there is a family history )both parents, aunts, cousins). He's not feeling well at all - no energy, sleepy, pain in his legs all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Is it safe to wait until his doctor's appointment or should I take him to the ER?\u00a0\u00a0I'm very worried.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much!",
