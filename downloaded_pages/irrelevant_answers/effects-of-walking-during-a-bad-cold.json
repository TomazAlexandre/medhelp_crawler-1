            "answer": "I dont think so. With a bad cold, you should stay in bed, sleep alot, drink lots of\u00a0\u00a0tea and water, and have a huge pot of selfmade chicken soup with ginger and carrots.Exercise is able to force the bugs even deeper into your system, as well as lower your immune system. Exercise is good for prevention, but not if you already caught it. Please be safe, have a hot bath and go back to bed.If the cold is long and ongoing, you might want to visit the amazonian house of your nearest Zoo. Sit there with a good book for a few hours, since the air is warm and moist and helps breathing. Get vicks vapo rub and do some steam inhalation at home, it will help, too.",
