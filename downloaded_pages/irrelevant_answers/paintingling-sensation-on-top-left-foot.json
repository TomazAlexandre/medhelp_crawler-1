            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.There are quite a few possibilities here. Firstly these symptoms could be due to peripheral neuropathy which can occur due to diabetes or B12 deficiency. There is also a chance that due to playing tennis you may have got pinched nerve at the ankle.I would suggest you to do some gentle foot exercises and stop playing tennis for a while. Cold packs, OTC pain killers and B complex supplements will also provide relief.If symptoms do not improve please get yourself evaluated by a clinician. Take care!",
