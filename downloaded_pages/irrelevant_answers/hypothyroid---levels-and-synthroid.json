            "answer": "\"Iron deficiency anemia, a major public health problem in developing countries, is associated with higher HbA1c and higher fructosamine [3]. Consistent with these observations, iron replacement therapy lowers both HbA1c and fructosamine concentrations in diabetic and non-diabetic individuals [3-5]. HbA1c, but not glycated albumin, is increased in late pregnancy in nondiabetic individuals owing to iron deficiency [6].\" - Factors that Interfere with HbA1c Test Results",

    "question": "Hi there,I have been having hypothyroid symptoms for quite sometime now and actively trying to get pregnant as well with 2 miscarriages and implantation failure after IVFs.Just recently I was told that I may need to take thyroid medications and it seems my hba1c levels are also high. Here are my lab results. Anything you guys can suggest would be helpful. I have been prescribed synthroid 0.25 mg and metformin 500 mg. nothing for the low iron levels.1. Haemoglobin A1C - 5.9 (high) ( i have always struggled with this level even though fasting and PP glucose are always within limit). does this mean I will need to take metformin?2. TSH - 4.6 uIU/ml (high) -- this is alarming as my previous levels have always been little over 2. so not sure what this means. I am shedding hair wherever i go, if that makes sense and have trouble keeping off weight even with exercise and diet restrictions. I have heard about Synthroid but dont know if it is prescribed during TTC? I guess there is no turning back once you start taking these though, right?Free T3 - 3.04 pg/mlFree T4- 0.96 mg/dlThyroid peroxidase - 11Thyroglubulin, antibody - <1.03. Homocysteine - 7.3 umol/L - i think this seems to be within range considering that I am positive heterozygous for mthfr (c677T).4. However my ferritin is only 20 ng/ml. is this low and will I need to take something to fix it?I also have low levels ofMCV - 77 lowMCH - 25.1 lowI am told that anemia could lead to high hba1c levels for some reason.",
