            "answer": "There can be several reasons of your generalized body numbness &, tingling although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Most likely your symptoms could be due to injury to a nerve, pressure on spinal/peripheral nerves (neuropathy), vitamin deficiency, lack of blood supply due to cholesterol plaque from atherosclerosis in the extremities, viral infection and use of certain medications.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, atherosclerosis can also cause pain, numbness, and tingling while walking and they can also reduce blood supply and lead to numbness.

            "answer": "Thank you for the suggestions I will check them out.\u00a0\u00a0It's weird because I notice that sometimes my arm is hurting but when I move the pain subsides. The same is true for shin and other painful areas. Something pressing on the area sometimes makes the pain worse. I noticed today I went out shopping and later when I came home everything was aching. My most painful area is the shin (burning sensation) but I have been known to have shin splints it just seems worse and more constant,\u00a0\u00a0also knees and wrists. Would this be consistent with MS that moving around causes it to get worse. Or that it jumps around so frequently?Thank youJennifer",

    "question": "I posted a few days ago that I was having tingling sensations in my feet and hands. Now I am also having pain in my shins arms different places.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it is a pain other time's more of a burning sensation.\u00a0\u00a0I am freaking out!! I can't sleep no appetite I don't know what to do. On top of that sometime's I get this weird jumpy sensation in different areas( similiar to when your eye twitches)I saw my Dr. he drew blood today to check for vitamin deficiencies, diabetes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He said he doesn't think it is MS. But from what I am reading it sounds a lot like it. Can someone please help me. Should I go to the hospital? How can I get the Dr.'s to take me seriously or to do a lumbar puncture or something to figure out what is wrong. I am going crazy with worry. I have two kids to care for, and I am exhausted.Does anyone have any ideas? I don't know why it started with one thing and has progressed to this. Please someone help me out here. Thanks for listening!Jennifer",
