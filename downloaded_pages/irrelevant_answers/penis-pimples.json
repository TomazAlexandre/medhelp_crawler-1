            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to a sebaceous cyst. A sebaceous cyst is a closed sac occurring just under the skin which contains a \"pasty\" or \"cheesy\" looking substance called keratin. They may occur anywhere on body but scalp, ears, back, face, and upper arm, are common sites for sebaceous cysts. Blocked sebaceous glands, swollen hair follicles and excessive testosterone production will cause such cysts.Generally no treatment is required but they become painful then it means they are infected, Then surgical excision by traditional wide excision, minimal excision, and punch biopsy excision may be required.My sincere advice is to consult a dermatologist and get it evaluated.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
