            "answer": "also, if you refuse the test, your doctor reserves the right to refuse future service to you, as in they can decide not to see you any longer. It is really recommended, the 3 hour test sucked, but I'd rather know whether or not I had gestational diabetes for my child's sake because you are more at risk for having a large baby, and this can result in c-section if they don't induce you earlier. And also, if you do have gestational diabetes and don't control it while you are pregnant, it increases your chances dramatically of having type 2 permanently once you are no longer pregnant.",
