            "answer": "HiThanks for a detailed post. When was the last time you had an ultrasound. In case this was done long time back, I think you should get one to see the condition of the ovary. At times there is accompanying endometriosis which complicates the condition. The various symptoms you have can be explained by it. Other hormonal tests should be done to see the calcium phosphate metabolism etc. There could be a stone, since you have developed pain in the groin area. Alternatively your gastric symptoms could be due to an irritable bowel.At times a laproscopic evaluation of the whole abdomen helps. I know it sounds frightening but is actually a very simple procedure. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.",

    "question": "This started out as going more frequently and now i have some difficulty going. Usually when i go its a steady, quick stream, now i set down and have to wait like half a minute before i go and when i do go it's in penny size drops. the other day it felt like i had i bad urinary track infection.\u00a0\u00a0My other symptoms are a dull pain in my lower back usually fallowed by gas, pain in the gallbladder area that comes and goes, pain right where the ribs end but not that bad or often, pain in certain areas of the midriff, Urine that sinks to the bottom of the toilet water ( only 2 or 3 times so far), stinging pain in small areas on ether side in / below the groin and in the very top of the legs (just started today and only happened once or twice) and diarrhea every once in a while.\u00a0\u00a0Also i find it much easier to go when i drink more fluids.Friday i went to the ER because of nasea and stomech pain. My right solder had been hurting as well and The triage nurse said it sounded like a classic case of gallstones. At the ER they did a blood and urine test, both came back fine.I did go to the doctor today for a sinus infection and she gave me some anti-biotics for it and said it should clear up my going problem and if it isn't gone by the time the sinus infection is gone to come back.So now i am both confused and concerned.Note:I have type 2 diabetes, a sinus infection and PCOS.",
