    "question": "I feel fortunate that this pregnancy hasn't turned me into a leaky faucet or constant ***** for nine months. And I realize it's social media so I probably shouldn't buy much into it, but today I put up a status (which I was trying to be comical about) about going grocery shopping at 37 weeks pregnant being my\u00a0\u00a0biggest struggle yet. I've dealt with my feet swelling since 15 weeks, and any more they resemble baby elephants' feet day and night. I dealt with morning sickness for 7 months, gestational diabetes, and for the last two months crippling sciatic nerve pain on top of working 50+ hours a week. At this point, I've gotta keep laughing instead of crying because I finally see the finish line. And I don't well publicize my difficult pregnancy, I'd rather not let myself be a target for people to treat me like I'm delicate. But one person that I'm friends with, who I have shared my difficulties with, commented with the remark that I ought to try waittressing at 39 weeks, and as fad as she's said, she's had a perfect pregnancy. Something about reading that makes my blood absolutely boil. I'm not sure that I'm angry in a rational sense or if it's mostly hormones, because usually little things like that don't set me off, but for whatever reason I'm fuming!",
