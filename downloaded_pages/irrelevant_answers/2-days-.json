            "answer": "Omg how exciting!!! Two days! Lucky! I don't even want to keep with my countdown cus I honestly feel like I'm super stuck on these same numbers so I just keep saying less then a month Lol. I'm scared about the tubes too, getting them tied as well. And just pretty much my health and babies with the diabetes and all there's more risk. With my two year old I got gestational diabetes and I was so sick the last weeks of pregnancy my sugar was not controlled at all so he was born hypoglycemic, and almost 11 lbs, so he had to stay in the nicu for about a week till they controlled his sugar. Tough times. I pray we don't go through the same but I can already tell we're heading the same route with me being so sick again. Goof luck though , can't wait for your labor story and to hear about your tubes getting tied and all. I want to hear it all! The good the bad I don't care. I need to know what to expect lol",
