You will go in fasting get some blood drawn drink a nasty drink, and get your blood drawn 1 and 2 hours after you drank that stuff. .. if that comes back out of range then they send you to a nutritionist and have you start checking your sugars at home, then go from there. I am dealing with gestational diabetes too so if you have any other questions feel free to contact me. It's very common and all due to our stupid hormones going crazy.",
