            "answer": "I just want to reiterate about chiropractic. You've probably heard some negatives, but I encourage you to research it for yourself and find friends or family who have had positive results. The purpose of chiropractic is to remove stress from the body and many times abdominal pain can be misdiagnosed as nerve entrapment syndrome of the thoracic spine. Sometimes treating the spine can alleviate digestive problems such as gas, indigestion, and acid reflux. I have also been informed that gallstones can only be seen on ultrasound if they are in the duct and not in the gallbladder. I don't know if this is true or not. Good luck with your dad. I feel confident you will find the answers to his health concerns.",

            "answer": "I agree with astros18, basically what all of us want is a cure, solution whether it is provided by normal medicine, alternative, holistic, chiropractic.....I personally would recommend lab work done like CRP levels, Amylase, CBC etc.Upper GI endoscopy should be performed again even if negative initially because false negative results can always come out.Some docs dislike alternative approach, rather look down on it. Here is a personal example:I know an RN who once worked with me in ICU. Presently she has weakness of her extremities & no doc has been able to diagnose her condition with confidence.

    "question": "Thank you for your posts. This is a continuation of my same post, below. My father had an ultrasound today of his gallbladder, which was negative. They also looked at the pancreas but didn't say anything about it. He already had an appt with his Dr scheduled for tomorrow, so I assume they'll talk it over then. In the meantime, we're all very upset. The technician did say that she saw no gallstones, but a lot of gas. Could it simply be excessive gas that is causing his symptoms? Back pain too?\u00a0\u00a0Is gas ever a symptom of pancreatic cancer?\u00a0\u00a0Regarding PC, he has type II diabetes, (which he controls with oral meds) but his blood sugar has been very steady throughout his symptoms. If he had PC, would it be harder to regulate? He has no unexplained weight loss, jaundice, nausea or vomiting. His back pain is mostly in his upper back, at night, and is not relieved by sitting up or bending forward. It only goes away when the abdomenal pain subsides.If (please please please) his pancreas ultrasound was clear, any thoughts on what could cause this?",
