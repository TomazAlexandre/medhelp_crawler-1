            "answer": "Hi,The cause for the increased/frequent urination needs to be looked into. It could possibly be due to diabetes and thus will suggest you to get a blood sugar done and rule out diabetes mellitus. The second possibility is a stone in the urinary tract which can also present with increased urination and burning sensation in the urine. Please do get an ultrasound or preferably a CT-IVU to rule out a stone of the urinary tract. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
