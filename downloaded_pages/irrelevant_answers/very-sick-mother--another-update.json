            "answer": "This may be off the subject or totally irrelevant to your grandmother's situation, BUT.. My grandmother had the taste distortion problem for about 2-3 years.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor put her on vitamin B12 shots once per month and her taste returned to normal!!! She has several health problems and has had them for years.. including diabetes, heart disease, glaucoma to name a few... just thought I would pass the Vit B12 info along.. possibly that could help your grandmother? It also helped mine have extra energy.. she is doing much better.. she's 83!",

    "question": "I have posted before twice about my mother (age 74), who has been very ill for over 2 and a half months with\u00a0\u00a0digestive ailments, including\u00a0\u00a0vomiting, diarrhea (which was worse early on), constipation (more common now) and a large weight loss (at least 25 pounds).A gallbladder scan found an ejection fraction of 0%.\u00a0\u00a0She is scheduled to have the gallbladder removed Thursday, although we have no guarantee that this will fix the problem.My current questions are:1.\u00a0\u00a0One of the main problems here has been that my mother just cannot eat regular\u00a0\u00a0food.\u00a0\u00a0She has been surviving for weeks on Ensure.\u00a0\u00a0She says everything 'tastes like garbage'\u00a0\u00a0(except, mercifully, the Ensure, which she thinks tastes like it should).\u00a0\u00a0I asked her if things smelled normal, and she seemed to think they did, but that they tasted terrible.\u00a0\u00a0One of her friends said this can be\u00a0\u00a0caused by\u00a0\u00a0zinc and/or potassium deficiency; is this true?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any other electrolytes that could be the cause?2.\u00a0\u00a0Because of her problems, my\u00a0\u00a0mother has elected to go off most of her medications, and she was on a lot of them.\u00a0\u00a0I believe she was on a cholesterol-lowering med, diuretic (Lasix), potassium supplement, multivitamin, and morphine, which she has taken for 14 years following botched back surgery.\u00a0\u00a0She may have also been on some kind of estrogen, because after breast cancer 12 years ago, the tamoxifen gave her terrible hot flashes, which she never got during menopause.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing she is still taking is the morphine.\u00a0\u00a0The question is, could discontinuing the medications have caused the taste distortion?3.\u00a0\u00a0Given her sudden onset of symptoms and the description of said symptoms, what else could cause the taste distortion?\u00a0\u00a0She never had a fever or gallbladder pain that I know of.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be gallbladder related, or just\u00a0\u00a0a result of all the digestive upset, or is there ANY OTHER plausible reasons you can think of?This is a major, major issue, because obviously\u00a0\u00a0in order to have a shot at recovery, she's going to have to eat!",
