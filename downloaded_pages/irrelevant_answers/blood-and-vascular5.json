            "answer": "Hi!The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies or vascular pathologies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Nerve conduction studies should be done. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. There are many other causes of nerve disorder causing pins and needles or glove-and-stocking neuropathy or paresthesia including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in Lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Multiple sclerosis and G B Syndrome (less likely) are two other possibilities.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
