Some of his symptoms may be due to sleep anpea, or a heart condition, so I agree he should be evaluated in the near future.

    "question": "I am writing as a concerned daughter. My Dad is 54 and has type 2 diabetes, he has had it for several years, my Dad has always been a large man but he has put more and more weight on, dosent eat well (as in fattening, sugary foods), in the past few weeks I haev noticed swelling to hands and legs especially his ankles, he has had to even remove wedding rings. He always seems to sleep at the nearest opportunity and his breathing is very heavy. I have tried to get him to see a doctor but he refuses and believes nothing is wrong! Am I over reacting or is this a complication he shuld see a doctor about?",
