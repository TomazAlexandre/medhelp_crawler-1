No, most of the time, dealing with it is just a daily habit.3. Yes, my immune system attacked my pancreas and destroyed its insulin-producing cells so that I can no longer produce insulin to convert the food that I eat to energy. I must take insulin injections and try to balance the dosage with the foods I eat in order to protect my body from damages caused by high blood sugar levels.4. No, type 1 diabetics can eat most foods as long as we know how many carbohydrates are in those foods.5. Yes, my identical twin (according to studies, when one twin has type 1 diabetes, 50 percent of the other twins develop it, too)6. Hospital7. No, not difficult8. No, there is a good variety9. Yes, for I have to test my glucose levels many times during the day and adjust my insulin accordingly, while other people do not have to fit this into their daily schedules.",

            "answer": "Please note that this forum is for type 1 diabetics, so the responses here will be oriented on that disease. Type 1 (juvenile) is an autoimmune disease usually, but not always, occurring in childhood. We do not have type 2 diabetes as does 90% of the diabetic population. Type 2 is typically associated with diet and weight issues, though it also has a genetic component that is part of the cause.The effects of diabetes on the body, however, are about the same for type 1 and type 2 if good control is not maintained. The diet concerns, eating healthy foods in reasonable quantities, are the same.My answers:1. 42 years2. Some years yes, others no3. Yes, my pancreas no longer produces insulin and the constant variation in blood glucose is slowly destroying my body. For me it has caused nerve damage to my extremities and internal organs (neuropathy), damage to my eyes (retinopathy), clogging of blood vessels in the extremities and heart (atherosclerosis), bone fractures (Charcot) and may eventually cause kidney failure.4. Yes, as complications have limited my diet choices.5. Yes, my cousin did. He died recently after 30 years with type 1 after heart problems.6. A routine doctor visit 2 weeks after a classmate died of undiagnosed type 1.7. Yes. Too much food, prepared with too much fat, sugar or spices.8. Yes.9. Yes. I have suffered discrimination and social isolation, so I hide it. This makes managing it sometimes stressful.But when I am struggling to balance my food and insulin, my life is good.Larry",

            "answer": "1. 12 years (since I was 18)2. Not anymore, but it was difficult at first.3. Yes, my pancreas no longer works, which means it does not produce insulin to control my blood sugar, which rises from the amount of glucose in my body. So far I haven't had any apparent damage from unstabilized blood glucose levels but am very aware that complications can develop later on if I'm not careful.4. No, I can eat whatever I want as long as I determine how many carbs the food has and take my insulin accordingly to balance the carbs. However, sometimes it's frustrating when eating out and not having information on the amount of carbs in foods -guessing is the only option but it doesn't always work that well.5. No one else in my family has diabetes of either type.6. I had syptoms for about a year: frequent urination, rapid loss of weight, extreme fatigue, thirst and hunger, etc. I had a very irresponsible doctor who kept telling me it's all in my head but finally did do a blood test -however he never checked the results and was difficult to get a hold of. The reason I finally found out I'm diabetic was thanks to a gynocologist, to whom I had to go since untreated diabetes also had stopped me from menstruating for months. She did a blood test on me and she's the one who called me to tell me I'm diabetic and then informed my doctor about it. He left me to my own devices for an entire weekend and told me to come into the hospital on Monday, where, after 12 hours in the emergency waiting room, with sugar over 500, I was finally admitted and stayed in the hospital for 5 days.7. See answer to question #48. see above9. Sometimes, but only because I have to do things other people don't -like check my sugar and go to the bathroom frequently. I can never carry a cute small little purse because I have to have supplies with me at all times, I stress out a bit more when on vacation and my pump is fairly visible. However, that just means that I'm aware of my diabetes and the fact that others around me don't have it -but it doesn't bother me.Good luck on your assignment!",
