I know it is from the pap smear and there's been nothing since. But my cervix HURTS!Has anyone else had a pap yet and your cervix hurt bad afterwards? I think I'm going to bed early tonight so I can rest.Definitely will post about the U/S when I have it!!!UmYusra- I'm sorry! It was hard to wait as long as I did for my appointment (a month) so I'm certain it's hard to see all of us having appointments. *HUGS* Each doctor's office is different. I think I was seen sooner because of previous miscarriages and problems.",
