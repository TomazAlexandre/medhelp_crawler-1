            "answer": "Hi,You have mentioned about some abnormality in the neck CT scan. Do you by any chance remember what it was?Since on an average your scans and tests have been normal neurological lesions, diabetes have been ruled out.These symptoms could be due to nerve compression in upper part of neck or they can be due to excessive anxiety. I would suggest you to do some deep breathing exercises everyday eat on time and drink plenty of water. B complex supplements may also help.Hope this helps!",

            "answer": "Thank you for the reply.So I still could have compressed a nerve even though the MRI came back normal?I've been doing deep breathing, B-complex, inositol this last week.\u00a0\u00a0Seems to help a little but not much with the light headedness/nausea.I have noticed an increased sensitivity to light/noise, I went to see a movie last night and got tingling in my scalp during all the flashing, and had to stare at the floor for most of the film.\u00a0\u00a0I keep getting weird sensations at the top of my head too.Report from CT Scan:TITLE: CAT 0041 CT CERVICAL SPINE W/O CONTRAST * Mar 5 2009 11:29PMPROCEDURE REASON: NUMBNESS IN FACEDIAGNOSIS: NUMBNESS IN FACE ?ALLERGIC REACTIONRESULT: CT CERVICAL SPINE 03/05/09 BC/djTECHNIQUE: This exam was performed without contrast enhancement.FINDINGS: Multiple axial images were obtained. Coronal and sagittalreconstructions were also obtained. There is reversal of the normalcervical lordotic curve. There is also lateral cervical curvature convex tothe right. No fractures or dislocations are seen. There is prominentdegenerative spurring at C5-6 intervertebral disk space narrowing anteriorlyat this level. There is mild encroachment upon the right neural foramen atC5-6. Postoperative changes involving the mandible.IMPRESSION: Cervical spondylosis at C5-6.TITLE: CAT 0013 CT BRAIN/HEAD WO CONTRAST* Mar 5 2009 11:29PMPROCEDURE REASON: NUMBNESS IN FACEDIAGNOSIS: NUMBNESS IN FACE ?ALLERGIC REACTIONRESULT: CT BRAIN 03/05/09 BC/djTECHNIQUE: This exam was performed without contrast enhancement.FINDINGS: The ventricles are midline and are not dilated. There is nohemorrhage. No mass lesions are seen. No bony abnormalities are noted.There is mild mucosal thickening in the ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses. Themastoids are clear.IMPRESSION:1. Mild mucosal thickening in ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses.2. No intracranial abnormalities.MRI:TITLE: MRI 0086 MRI SPINE CERVICAL WO CONTRAST Mar 6 2009 7:11AMPROCEDURE REASON: NUMBNESSDIAGNOSIS: RECHECK NUMBNESSTITLE: MRI 0086 MRI SPINE CERVICAL WO CONTRAST Mar 6 2009 7:11AMPROCEDURE REASON: NUMBNESSDIAGNOSIS: RECHECK NUMBNESSRESULT: MRI OF CERVICAL SPINE WITHOUT INTRAVENOUS CONTRAST 3/6/09, AC/cah.HISTORY: Numbness.COMPARISON: Cervical spine CT from 3/5/09.TECHNIQUE: Routine MRI protocol for cervical spine without intravenouscontrast administration.FINDINGS: Image quality is suboptimal due to patient motion during severalpulse sequences. There is stable reversal of cervical lordosis with apex atC5-6 disk space. Articulation at the atlantooccipital and craniocervicaljunctions, including atlantoaxial interval, are within normal limits.Vertebral heights minimally lost at C5 and C6 levels unchanged from therecent CT study. Remaining vertebral heights are maintained. No focalspondylolysis nor significant spondylolisthesis is identified.Degenerative disk disease detected most notably at C4-5 and C5-6 level.Central canal remains widely patent without evident cord compression norsignificant central canal stenosis. Cervical cord is normal in morphologicappearance without focal expansile or atrophic process. No significant cordsignal abnormality is detected to suggest myelopathic change.At C2-3 level, disk height is maintained. Central canal neural foraminabilaterally are patent.At C3-4 level, disk height is maintained. Central canal and right neuralforamen are patent. Minimal left sided neural foraminal stenosis detectedsecondary to bony arthropathy.At C4-5 level, there is mild disk height loss with degenerative diskdesiccation. Minimal posterior disk protrusion is detected which effacesthe ventral thecal margin slightly more to the right of midline. There isno cord impact from the protruding disk. Central canal remains patent.Minimal left neural foraminal stenosis is detected while the right neuralforamen is patent.At C5-6 level, there is mild to moderate disk height loss with mildposterior disk protrusion. Focal signal abnormality in the posteriorprotruding disk may suggest annulus fibrosis tear. Protruding disk alsoeffaces the ventral thecal margin eccentrically more to the right of themidline and contribute to mild central canal stenosis at this level.Protruding disk additionally extend toward the right lateral recess andcombine with mild bony arthropathy to provide moderate right neuralforaminal stenosis. Degenerative changes also contribute to mild leftneural foraminal stenosis.At C6-7 level, there is minimal disk height loss with minimal posterior diskprotrusion which effaces the ventral thecal margin. Central canal remainspatent. Right neural foramen is also patent. Bony arthropathy providesmild to moderate left neural foraminal stenosis.At C7-T1 level, central canal neural foramen bilaterally are widely patent.IMPRESSION:1. Limited study due to patient motion. Stable appearance ofcervical spine since the recent CT study.2. Degenerative change is noted at C4-5 and C5-6 disk levelscontributing to mild central canal stenosis at C5-6 level.3. Varying degrees of neural foraminal stenosis detected most notably inthe right C5-6 level as described on the recent CT.4. No evidence of cord compression.Findings discussed with Dr. Kolm in the emergency room.",

Catscan of neck abnormal, but neck MRI came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Followed up w/ neurologist, received general reflex/sensation/strength workup.\u00a0\u00a0Passed normal.\u00a0\u00a0Follwed up w/ general practitioner.\u00a0\u00a0Submitted blood work for Lyme/ANA/Sjogren\u2019s factor.\u00a0\u00a0Drs all think its anxiety.This morning I woke up in the middle of the night with a numb scalp. Last night I woke up at 3am w/ full facial numbness and tingling/weakness all over my body.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to go away as soon as I sit up.\u00a0\u00a0I went back to bed and woke up a few hours later with only numb lips.\u00a0\u00a0This immediately subsided as soon as I sat up.\u00a0\u00a0I have been getting anxiety attacks and feeling as I am going to pass out.\u00a0\u00a0Worse during sleep/early afternoon.I did have one episode similar on 05/2008 where I woke up w/ tingling and ended up w/ syncopal episode.\u00a0\u00a0Paramedics documented blood sugar @ 45mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugar has tested normal since.My stats: 27, 6'3, 190lb, normal bp, liver function normal, no anemia, no diabetes, (blood workup from ER came back normal)My history: mild/moderate sleep apnea, ocd/anxiety, ?possible sjogren's? (lip biopsy came back + but not sure this was accurate, waiting on blood work mentioned above to rule it out)05/2005 - Had a baseline brain MRI because I was complaining of headaches/cloudiness.\u00a0\u00a0Normal MRI.Family history: mom has NMO/Devic's, aunt has an autoimmune, mom's cousin has rheumatoid.\u00a0\u00a0Dad has diabetes (type 2).I want to rule out serious issues like nerve compression, cranial nerve lesion, onset of multiple sclerosis, brain clotting/tumors/bleeding, circulation issues, or even lyme disease, before attributing this to anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Should I get another brain MRI or a spine MRI?\u00a0\u00a0Get a new pillow (I\u2019ve been using an apnea pillow)?",
