            "answer": "Not a doctor but I had gallbladder removed because it just stopped working, too!\u00a0\u00a0No stones, just stopped working!\u00a0\u00a0Of course - I AM a diabetic and I am also a recovering alcoholic so drinking did not help with the gall bladder thing.\u00a0\u00a0However, have they tested your prostate????\u00a0\u00a0My dad had prostate troubles and had the urinary symptoms you listed.\u00a0\u00a0Might want to have that checked out.Your fastings do not indicate diabetes and your glucose tolerance is good.\u00a0\u00a0The back spinal pain in the mid section is probably related to the gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0I had so much pain in my mid section and it shot up through my back into my shoulder as well.\u00a0\u00a0I used to think I had pancreatitis and all sorts of stuff but it was my gall bladder!\u00a0\u00a0So, calm down.\u00a0\u00a0Good thing is - you CAN live without the gallbladder!\u00a0\u00a0You just have to be really carefully about the amount of fat you consume!Hope all goes well...",

    "question": "I have been experiencing bouts of Diabetes like symptoms for the last 5 years, since I was 30 yrs old. I was borderline overweight, and was not having enough physical activities.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor always said I was just stressed.My main symptoms are 2~3 wake ups at night, thirst and urination.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I experience thirst and frequent urination too after a heavy lunch meal.\u00a0\u00a0Plus my gallbladder is not functioning.It all started when I sat in front of the computer and watch 3 hours of NBA basketball daily after coming home from my desk job at work.\u00a0\u00a0I started getting irritated by the games and I am sure my insulin level shoot through the roof. I started having high blood pressures and dizziness for a while.I have no family history of diabetes, and recently had a glucose tolerance test:Fasting 92Glucose 1 hour - 170Glucose 2 hour - 131The doctor says I DON'T have diabetes, and does not require medication. I was feeling particularly well the day of the test.\u00a0\u00a0I have done some home fasting glucose test, and the results have been in the 90's ~ 101.But I DO have diabetes symptoms, and this last bout of attacks have been lasting for the last 5 months.\u00a0\u00a0Since it started I have lost quite a bit of weight (15 lbs), exercised regularly, eat healthy and discovered my gallbladder is not functioning (no stones).Please advise what could be happening and what I should do, since my doctors have been unable to help me (after tons of blood tests, ultrasound, CT Scan, HIDA Scan).Thanks in advance!",
