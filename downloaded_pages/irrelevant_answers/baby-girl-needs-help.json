            "answer": "Well Dr never really explains why she has a high liver enzyme count they just keep retesting her and everytime it is just a little lower. I know high enzymes indicate liver injury etc but you can also have high counts if the correct enzymes are not working as they should. Diabetes, celiac, cf can all through off your enzyme count I think what they are looking for is how she is digesting her food. I do have diabetes in my family does anybody if all this could be symptoms of that. We asked the Dr all she said was they checked her glucose once and it seemed fine, but i know you can't test glucose levels once they are costantly changing everytime you eat.",

    "question": "My daughter has been ftv for almost 5 months now and her dr does not have an answer. She will turn a year old in july and she only weights 13 lbs now. We get her blood tested twice a month at least and the only result we get is that her liver enzymes are high. Her symptoms are failure to thrive, high liver enzymes, she is shorter for her age and her stomach seems to swell up whenever she eats, my wife compares it to the children you see in those feed the children ads. Other than those things she is normal she does everything that a normal baby her age should do. The only other thing I can think of is when she was born she had jaundice for about a week and a half. Any help is appreciated we are currently in the process of switching to another specialist in Dallas but they can't get her in until August.",
