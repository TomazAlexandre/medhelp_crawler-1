            "answer": "Hi!Low creatinine levels are seen if there is muscle wasting. If the levels are so low and potassium levels are high maybe a creatinine clearance test should be done to test the condition of the kidney and rule out diabetes insipidus. CPK or creatinine phosphokinase and liver enzymes should be done if there is muscle wasting. Diabetes insipidus can also cause whole body edema. Please consult an endocrine specialist and a nephrologist. Take care!",
