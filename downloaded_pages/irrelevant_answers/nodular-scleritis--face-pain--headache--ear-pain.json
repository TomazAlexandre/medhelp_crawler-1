            "answer": "Without examining you and reviewing your history, I can not provide a diagnosis. The initial face pain could have been a form of trigeminal neuralgia. However the balance problem would not be explained by this. You should have an evaluation by a neurologist. A MRI of the brain with contrast to look for signs of inflammation would be helpful, and you may require a spinal tap after this. The spinal fluid can be analyzed for signs of inflammation. Depending where you are in South Carolinia, you could go to the University of South Carolina, Duke University, University of North Carolina, or Georgia. In addition to these tests a more comprehensive connective tissue and inflammatory evaluation could be completed. Good luck.",
