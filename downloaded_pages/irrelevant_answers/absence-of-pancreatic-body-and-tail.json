            "answer": "Pancreatic divisum is a congentital problem, so there is no real treatment. The docs can try cutting the opening of the smaller duct (the minor papilla) to open it up, or others will insert a stent duing ERCP (into the duct to prevent blockage) but that's really just about all that can be done to 'correct.' but other than that there's unfortunately little treatment that has been well characterized.If the pain is due not to the pancreas but to SOD, sphincter of Oddi dysfunction then her taking narcotic pain meds is not going to help. Narcotic-based meds result in higher ductal pressures and can actually cause pain. Did they do manometry of the common bile duct to establish that the pressures were at a normal level? Does your daughter have her gallbladder?",

            "answer": "CalGal, I don't think manometry of the common bile duct was done.\u00a0\u00a0And yes, she has her gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0The MD at Shands did not recommend an ERCP procedure to correct the divisum because there were no assurances that the benefits would be greater than the risk of the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Last night a \"fellow\" from Shands called to explain the CT finding that there was no pancreas body or tail. He said that he could visualize something that could be the body, but there definately was no tail and that the pancreas was significantly atrophied.\u00a0\u00a0He also said that Rebecca's tryptsin level was 5 vs normal of 20, indicating chronic pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0Interesting that the narc pain meds causes pain.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing else puts a dent into it tho.\u00a0\u00a0But that could be why higher levels have been needed.",

My doctor told me it was not anything to worry about since I have no symptoms of pancreatic problems and all my blood tests came back normal. He thinks my gallbladder or gerd is causing all the pressure I am feeling in my upper stomach. I wish he would find out soon because some days the pressure is so bad I feel as if my stomach is going to explode.Thanks",
