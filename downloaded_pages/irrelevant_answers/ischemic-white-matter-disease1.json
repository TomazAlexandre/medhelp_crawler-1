            "answer": "My wife's recent MRI listed:\"chronic ischemic small vessel white matter disease and other demyelinating processes\".Does that include MS?It also mentioned \"several spotty foci of high T1/FLAIR signal in a subcortical and periventricular distribution\"--Does this mean anything?I have heard that MS shows white matter disease in specific areas of the brain, areas different from those of migraines, for instance.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true?\u00a0\u00a0If so, in what areas will MS likely show up?Another of her MRI reports mentioned 'compressed CSF pool in the region of foramen magnum'.\u00a0\u00a0She is having Chiari alleviation surgery Jan 22, 08, but we are trying to find out of MS is at work in her also.Thanks for your help,Mike",

            "answer": "I am having petite mal seizures or black outs. I am seeing a neurologist and have been for the last seven years. He calls what I have petite mal but I am afraid that, when I do have these episodes Something awful may happen because I do drive and I have had a few accidents. I do not want to lose my license but know it might happen if I cannot find out what can be done besides taking medication. MRI's, Cat scans, and any other type of scan, have all been okay. My seizures began from a car accident in 1993. I had a Grand mal and Petite mal\"s there after. They happen ever so often. I am 5'3 and weight 190, could it be a weight problem? Thank you.Patricia",

            "answer": "PLEASE\u00a0\u00a0be very careful if you take cumadin (the blood thinning drug); know the risk as well as the benefit.\u00a0\u00a0 My mother was on this medication and she had weakened blood vessels from years of high blood pressure. She had white ischemic matter disease also.\u00a0\u00a0She had a rupture of an artery in her brain and she was bleeding in her brain so fast that they could not alter the affects of the cumadin in time to do surgery to stop it. It is so important to double check your dosages, keep a close watch on your pro-time ( measure of how thin your blood is ), and if you start having small surface blood vessels just bursting with very little or no stress to that area, GO TO THE DOCTOR!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If you bump or hit your head, have yourself checked immediately, don't assume anything!\u00a0\u00a0Patients on cumadin should use the same precautions as people who are 'bleeders'.",
