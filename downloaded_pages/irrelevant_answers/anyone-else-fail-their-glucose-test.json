            "answer": "I took mine last monday. They haven't called me so I guess I passed it. Did you have Gestational Diabetes with any of your other kids? If not it could just be that your body takes longer than average to process sugar. My doc told me that usually if you haven't had it in a previous pregnancy chances are you won't have it in the current one either, unless its been like ten years between kids or your body has changed dramatically. Try to do your test in the morning. Its easier. Schedule for first thing and don't eat breakfast. You should be fine.",

I have not been eating sweets this pregnancy, I just cant stomach it, so I understand the sugar being low, but the iron, wow, I eat alot of red meat and very healthy foods so that was a total shocker to me.....They told me to take iron twice a day, and drink alot of OJ and eat sugary snacks....Does anyone have any other ideas on what else I can do?Also feather when do you go in for your next test?",

            "answer": "I had my test last Friday and failed with a 154. I had eaten some chocolate the night before (what was I thinking I don't know). They also said my hemoglobin was low and I had to start iron supplements, which is weird for me too since I eat a good amount of red meat and dark leafy greens. I have eaten pretty healthy, have only gained 4lbs (I am a bit overweight so they only wanted me to gain around 25), and my child is only measuring in the 16th percentile so I am not sure how I could have gestational diabetes, but we shall see. (Side note: I have a large fibroid, 14cm, which is accounting for part of why my baby boy is smaller, hes a little cramped) I go for my 3 hour on Monday and will see how it goes.Do you (that have failed) need to carbo load for 4 days before the test? I am not a big fan of giving my child a huge rush of sugar for 3 hours, nevermind the days before having to load up on them as well. I was wondering if this is common or just my office.",
