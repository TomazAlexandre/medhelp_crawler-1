    "question": "is anyone else dealing with a high risk pregnancy? one where you thought your due day was a month further from when the doctors determine baby will come? my due date is dec. 6, but my high risk doctor says he will most likely come the week of november 3rd. that is a huge difference and I am scared, but kind of at peace because I know he will be in good hands once he comes out. I am 33w5d so if he is correct that gives me roughly two weeks.",
