            "answer": "If the over use of the listerine was the problem I don't think it would isolate itself in the tongue. I think the other soft tissue of the mouth would be affected. It is possible that you have an allergy to alcohol, have that checked out. The last piece of advice would be to seek out an oral pathologist. You can locate them in a dental school or a teaching hospital. Have you seen an oral surgeon?",

    "question": "I have a white coated tongue i have been to the doctor and dentist for a diagnosis but no one seems to have a good enough answer for me.The doc told me it was thrush and that i should get tested for hiv.doctor placed me on nystatin for three months didnt clear up so i went to dentist. Dentist said that it was not thrush i just need to brush my tongue more often.so my question is should i believe the doc or dentist? If i brush my tongue the coating leaves but always returns i do drinnk alcohol and i use to smoke but not since the problem with the tongue occured i have been suffering from anxiety and stress before all of this also could that be the cause? oh yeah dont have any white patches in mouth just coating on tongue so can you tell me what might be going on with my tongue?Do you think this is a sign of disease such as Hiv if not what are other possibilities.One more thing i have been guilty of overusing listerine mouthwash as a replacement for brushing teeth in the past.I was tesetd for diabetes but test came back negative.",
