            "answer": "It may be a form of tinnitus. I used to think tinnitus was just ringing in the ears but I read recently it can be almost any kind of (annoying) noise in the ears. Do you take aspirin? I get a high pitched hum in one ear occasionally that lasts a few seconds then fades away. But yours sounds ongoing.I can also hear my heart beating in my ears when I'm retaining too much fluid. It's more noticeable at night\u00a0\u00a0when I'm most bloated and when I'm trying to get to sleep. Figures. But I can usually avoid this by being very careful in what I eat during the day. I don't have heart\u00a0\u00a0\"disease\" but I've found a low sodium diet makes me feel a lot better over all.",
