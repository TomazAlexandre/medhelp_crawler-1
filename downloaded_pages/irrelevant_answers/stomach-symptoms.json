            "answer": "Have you looked into your pancreas or gallbladder, liver?Abdominal pain with nausea and dizzy spells can mean an infection or blockage of some kind. You can get your liver enzymes tested to see of there is anything going on that would cause liver damage or injury, infections and disease have many early manifestations.Have you had any dr advise on this? Any tests? You can get thyroid checked, the TSH is a good place to start, but the free T3 and free T4 are a more sensitive test for thyroid function, although some drs reluctant to look any further if TSH is \"normal\". B12 deficiency is another issue. Seems the research indicates that our reference range for B12 at least in N America is not high enough and should be over 350, ideally 500 or more. But dr.s seem to think that's not the case. I beg to differ, but who am I, right? Mine is below 300, and I have many issues with the dr not feeling like that is a problem for me.Iron overload is another common genetic disorder missed in the early stages, with abdominal pain, nausea, fatigue, joint pain, and drs dont run these iron tests on regular blood panel. They are ferritin, transferrin saturation%, TIBC and serum iron. Also liver enzymes can indicate if there are any systemic problems, infections going on so an ALT, AST, and GGT reading are good to get with regards to liver. If overweight, good idea to get checked for diabetes, glucose intolerance, or cholesterol levels.Hope this might help...you can look up any or all of the above and see for yourself how your symptoms measure up and have some ideas to ask the dr. Get copies of your tests and labs, it is good to have copies to compare and research what tests mean what. Quite often our dr tell us we're fine and we just take their word for it.Best wishes...",
