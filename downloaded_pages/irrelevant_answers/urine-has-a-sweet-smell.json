            "answer": "When ther is excess sugar in the body, the first place that it will spill over into is the urine.\u00a0\u00a0So this sweet smell is most likely a result of your high blood sugars and may even be caused by ketones which can produce a fruity odor. It is true that when a person is in ketoacidosis for a long period of time they will begin to lose weight. This can be true for undiagnosed and untreated diabetics whose bodies are literally in starvation mode because they are not able to convert their food source into energy that can be used to function.\u00a0\u00a0This is the lay person's version of ketoacidosis and there is probably a more scientifc\u00a0\u00a0explanation.\u00a0\u00a0The bottom line is that ketoacidis left untreated can have very serious consequences.\u00a0\u00a0It sound s like you may be experiencing periodic ketoacidosis, but not to the point where you can't use any of the food you are eating.\u00a0\u00a0The bloated heavier feeling could result from higher blood sugars, weight gain from eating more or water retention form the stress on your system.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor, so I can't offer any real diagnosis, but I would suggest you see your doctor to find out exactly what is going on and to see if you can get some help in managing your diabetes.As a person who has had diabetes for 40 years, I know thatjust getting medical advice or information doesn't always help you get or stay in control.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is a tough disease to manage and to live with everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I have found that it can be really helpful to talk to other people who are going through the same things you are.\u00a0\u00a0Even after 40 years, it is comforting to know I am not alone in my struggle with diabetes and that no one does it perfectly.\u00a0\u00a0Your local Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation may offer a support group that meets your needs or they may be able to recommend one. As hard as it is, it is so important to try and maintain some control over our blood sugars because the consequences of poor control are worse than the disease.\u00a0\u00a0 So, after you get yourself to the doctor and make sure you are physically OK, I would recommend a support group to help you stay on track with your diabetes control. I wish you lots of success and I truly understand what a difficult challenge it is.Es",

    "question": "I have noticed recently that there is a sweet smell of my urine and I would like to know if this could possibly have anything to do with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have diabetes and at the moment it is out of control.\u00a0\u00a0I am having a lot of high-blood sugars,\u00a0\u00a0if this is ketone related, should I not be losing weight, instead I seem to feeling both heavier and bloated.If you can please answer this I'd be most appreciative.",
