            "answer": "Dear Friends,I have very much enjoyed my time on Medhelp and have learned from you even while hosting our Ask-A-Doctor forum for Diabetes. Sadly I am leaving the Medhelp community as my own practice has become busier and time constraints have proved quite challenging. So from April 7th 2008 I will be officially away from Medhelp, but you can still find me at our practice website www.endocrinehelp.com, so please drop me a\u00a0\u00a0line if you wish. Most likely a new physician will be hosting the Diabetes forum for Medhelp in the future, so please continue to check in with the Medhelp community.All the best to you and blessings for the future,Sincerely,Anita Ramsetty,MD",

            "answer": "Dear Dr. Anita R.I had a question about treating diabetes type II along with treating allergy related excema. I have tested my husband Paul in the past few weeks for a fasting blood sugar and he registered as having a pre-diabetic sugar level. I now know he is now currently a diabetic. He weighs 280/285 lbs and has recently had several diabetic symptoms. If he does not eat he gets headaches, moody, and recently (today) at work he saw a kalediscope circle in his face that followed him wherever he eyes turned. At the opposite end of the spectrum, even one bowl of cereal is too much and gets very lethargic. Paul also has allergies and has a recent flare up of excema (he is allergic specifically to milk, wood, dust and he works in a lumber yard so avoiding wood is not an option right now). We know what he has, but the question is How to treat both problems without drug interaction being negative. Please help any info would be appreciated. (I would have posted new topic but did not see any way to do so.)Thank you,Amy M.",
