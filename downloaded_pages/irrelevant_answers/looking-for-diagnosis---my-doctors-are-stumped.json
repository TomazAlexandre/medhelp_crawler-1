            "answer": "Hi,How are you?It is a very unusual case since all your cardiology, neurology and ENT reports are good and still your symptoms are persisting.What is the eye problem that you have? Is your BP under control?High BP can cause light headedness and weakness and so can a low blood sugar, dehydration and sleep deprivation.Please make sure your BP is adequately controlled by medication and salt restriction at all times, eat regularly and sleep for at least 8 hrs every day.Hope this helps!",
