            "answer": "Your symptoms simply sound like your blood glucose dropped too low from not having eaten or drank anything all day... If there were others with you, they should have called an ambulance or taken you to the nearest ER, rather than simply waiting to see if you came to.Not eating all day is very dangerous and unhealthy.\u00a0\u00a0If you had not gone to sit down, you could easily have fallen and hit your head when you passed out, which could have caused severe injury.It's very important that you make sure you eat regular,\u00a0\u00a0healthy meals throughout the day.",

            "answer": "I agree with Barb135.We are all very busy these days. Nothing is as important as you, so make sure you look after your self ;)Here's what I do (after I passed out after a day with no fuel.. )I eat small snacks every 3-4 hours to keep my blood sugar levels constant. This also saves me from craving food, getting dizzy or getting acid refluxes, stomach cramps, constipation and feeling edgy and tired and brain foggy..Our bodies need something to work with - ideally healthy, so I always have a little separate bag with a banana or mango or some other season fruit with me, some rice crackers with avocado or salad and dip, some muesli and yoghurt or a home made sandwich, mixed fruit in a container or take away cup as a \"boost\" drink.. whatever you like. Some mixed unsalted nuts are great for in-between as well.I also put on an alarm for my work days so I don't forget to eat. Also it's recommendable to drink enough water. Juices and other drinks still dehydrate you, so make sure u have at least 2-3 litres of pure water each day. Make it a routine to sip on your bottle every half and hour or so, instead of drinking heaps at once so your cells can actually use it.I read that your guts already take up to 70% of your water intake just to process food and absorb nutrients - and then imagine that your brain want's some as well after that :)It does require a bit more attention to your self and time for preparing but I feel heaps better and have more energy as well.Hope it helps, all the best!",

    "question": "I am almost 20, female; average body type; boarder line diet. Anyway, the other day I hadn't eaten or drank anything all day, then around 7-8pm I got dizzy. So I went to sit down, I guess I passed out. And when I came to, I didn't realize I had passed out, my vision was blurry, my ears were ringing, anything I heard sounded far away, I couldn't move or talk. I felt very weak. Also I guess I talked and said I was cold but I felt hot.. Finally I found the strength to snap out of it and drank some pop. Afterward I could talk and hear again. Then I ate. Ever since then... I wonder what happened... Please tell me what that was..",
