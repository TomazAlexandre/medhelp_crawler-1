            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!To treat constipation you have to find the cause. Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber and also due to dehydration. A high roughage with low water too could be a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc can all cause constipation. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies.A proper investigation is required preferably by a gastroenterologist (a doctor who looks after the digestive system) to know what is the cause. The treatment will follow correct diagnosis. Hope this helps. Take care!",

I'm constantly nauseated and I feel tired all the time.I'm so worried because my gp keeps prescribing the same thing and it's just not working! Infact I think it could be making the situation worse. I feel confused and scared I just don't have no idea what to do or where to start and I'm worried it may be too late?!?!\u00a0\u00a0Please can someone give me advice and help me??\"?\"",
