            "answer": "I don't find CT Scan's ability to detect cirrhosis the most convincing, but my understanding is that it is pretty good at detecting vascularture -- it maybe well be worthwhile for your friend to have an upper endoscopy to look for varices (and treat as necessary) if they are suspected.\u00a0\u00a0If their presence is detected, it's another indicator for diagnosis.Cirrhosis does not seem to follow a linear nor a predictable path, and my experience has taught me that it can very easily go undetected by routine screening.\u00a0\u00a0I'm always unconvinced without a multi-core biopsy, but that's my personal feeling (I've always been one of the serious doubters on the accuracy of staging techniques).In regards to blood results, using my husband as (admittedly a rather extreme)\u00a0\u00a0example, post-resection, even with his left lobe gone and the right one cirrhotic, his bloodwork was for the most part deceptively \"normal\" -- and his INR and albumin continue to be in normal range. Even when his cirrhosis spawned an hcc the size of one's fist, he had no abdominal pain, and nothing apparent on physical exam either (and only \"trace\" ascities on recent CT-Scans).I hope your friend is not stage 4, but if he is it sounds like it could be well-compensated cirrhosis.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is that he'd have to find an experienced liverhead and would need to be followed closely, but if he's class A (no or very minimal signs of decompensation), there's a good chance he might be a candidate for treatment.\u00a0\u00a0My husband's treatment has been difficult, and he is watched closely and monitored for possible decompensation, but it is doable for some stage 4s.\u00a0\u00a0Hope that helps.\u00a0\u00a0~eureka",
