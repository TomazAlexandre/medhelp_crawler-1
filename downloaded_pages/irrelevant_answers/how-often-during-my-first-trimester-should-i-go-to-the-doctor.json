            "answer": "I'm not high risk and my doctor wanted me to go every 2 weeks. He is money hungry! Every time I go there my insurance company pays him A LOT of money so it's no wonder that he wants me there all the time. Totally unnecessary. The standard is what has been said here - every 4 weeks. Unless, of course, you have one of the major medical conditions - high blood pressure, diabetes, etc. If you're healthy, then you're not high risk! Beware of money hungry doctors!!! I decided to switch to a different OB.",
