            "answer": "YES!YES!I have to go to the diabetes center, last summer my \"overlooked \" glucose test done by our local PA was not caught with numbers nearly 400...I got my records and took them to my Endo who ran his own test, and has me at intermediate diabetes/possible hypoglycemia...but he thinks it's possible once my thyroid is completely stabilized it may diasappear, in the meantime diet and excersize to keep levels down as best as I can. Next blood tests he's doing another antibody tests because he says that often if you have Graves you are at an increased risk of also having the antibodies that causes type I diabetes. (I'm praying not because if it's antibodies causes the blood sugar havoc , it can't be controlled just by diet)....So far since watching it I haven't had readings over 185......I knew I was having trouble a while back, you can buy your own monitor *generic runs about 10.00, tests strips fro about 25.00...you can chck your own levels and keep a little diary of what you eat and what your levels are annd take them to your doc...by the way, my fasting glucose is generally normal, so I had to take the two hour and three hour glucose tests...which are not normal....also they can run an HAC1 blood tests that gives them your average insulin levels for the past three months....also PCOS can cause insulin resistance....Hope this helps a bit,Pam",

            "answer": "Yes I have PCOS (Poly cystic Ovary Syndrome), I have been on Metformin for years now to help with the IR even though I am not yet diabetic! PCOS effects your hormones and usually you will have a high level of testerone including everything that comes along with it. Like facial hair(where men usually get it), Baldness, etc... But it also effects your fertility. I had two miscarriages before being dx with PCOS. With the help of Metformin I was able to get pregnant and have a healthy baby (A lot of women aren't so lucky just with the Met. and have to go through years of clomid, injections, etc....)And of course I too have had my handful of thyroid issues! But anyone looking for some information on PCOS I will post the link",
