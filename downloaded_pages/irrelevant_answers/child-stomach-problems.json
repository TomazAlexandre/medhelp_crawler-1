            "answer": "If you haven't already, you can try this:1. Breath test for Helycobacter pylori infection of the stomach. One of the most often infections, it goes with burping and bloating, which are not necessary very obvious.2. Gastric emptying test. She eats a meal, prepared in hospital and containing contrast substance, then they take images to see, how fast the stomach is emptying.3. Is she complaining about anything, anyone, school...I mean any psychic problem?4. Where exactly she feels soreness, at which exact point of abdomen? Any heartburn? Burping? Bloated before she vomits?5. Any change in bowel habit or stool appearance at times she has this vomiting?What tests she had so far?",
