Then the yellow and sick stuff subside are many people don't have symptoms for years, some do.\u00a0\u00a0If a person who has hcv, and doesn't know it, gets sick from time to time it's usually written off to a cold or flu or something.\u00a0\u00a0But even if a person does not have symptoms of hcv, the really cool part is that over the years hcv and all the nasty stuff it does slowly rots a person from the inside out.\u00a0\u00a0When enough damage is done that when the real fun begins like spontaneous internal bleeding, loss of some brain functions, liver impairment and failure, liver cancer - stuff like that.\u00a0\u00a0 The keen part is that this kind of damage does not have to begin with hcv.\u00a0\u00a0These kinds of things can happen and bring cirrhosis without hcv, if a person is just able to drink enough. 8 or 10 drinks 3 or 4 days a week should be about enough, over time.",

Many of us haven't had any alcohol or anything for years. Thanks for your input. It is quite a different problem than just having hep. C.",
