            "answer": "\"Is there any possible relationship with gall bladder and pacreas that can cause seriously high sugars.\"Nope. Your gall bladder functions to produce bile to aide in the digestive process. Mine was removed during surgery - don't need it, don't miss it. However, hypothyroidism does as it slows down your pancreas' process to produce insulin. Educate yourself on hypothyroidism foods to avoid.\"I know my cholesterol and tryglycerides are abnormal..\"This goes hand-in-hand with t2 diabetes. You can help yourself by reducing the intake of animal fat - red meat, bacon, butter, sausages, etc - along with limiting your intake of high [simple] carbohydrate foods [pasta & starches].Ask your Endo for a referral to a diabetes nutritionist/dietitian who has knowledge on hypothyroidism . Focus on what to eat not on what you cannot eat. If overweight, lose the excess poundage and do some sort of physical exercise daily. Good luck.",

            "answer": "\"Is there any possible relationship with gall bladder and pacreas that can cause seriously high sugars.\"Yes. Gallstones can block the bile duct. This causes the bile to back up and can prevent drainage of digestive juices from the pancreas. The backed up digestive juices (enzymes) start to digest the pancreas. This is very painful. Since the pancreas also has the Beta cells that produce insulin, it is very common for the blood sugars to be out of whack - uncontrolled. This is acute biliary pancreatitis. It is a medical emergency. I doubt you have this form since you are still posting.There is also a chronic form. Since you list pancreatitis in your heading, I am guessing your doctor told you that you had this - the chronic form.\u00a0\u00a0You can read more about it here but I really think you would be better served by talking with your healthcare provider. Ask what is happening and is this from gallstones and do you have pancreatitis and if so, what can you do and what can you expect. http://www.ddc.musc.edu/public/problems/diseases/pancreas/pancreatitisChronic.cfmI hope this finds you already seen by your endocrinologist and feeling better.",
