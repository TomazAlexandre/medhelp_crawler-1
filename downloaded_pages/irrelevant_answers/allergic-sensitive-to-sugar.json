            "answer": "I was diagnosed as having glucose intolerance.The test was carried out at the hospital, I was not allowed to eat for 24 hours and a blood test was taken.\u00a0\u00a0I was then given a glucose drink, and after a while they took another blood test.\u00a0\u00a0I knew that I had a problem because after the glucose drink, I just could not stop drinking.This is classed as prediabetes.If you have not been tested for diabetes, it may be a good idea to have a test done.\u00a0\u00a0Or like Caryopteris says it may be that your intestines cannot tolerate the concentrated glucose (sugar).",

            "answer": "You would have to have a glucose test carried out to find out.Hyperglycaemia is when there is far too much sugar in the blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0This happens in people with diabetes and they then have to inject some insulin to bring the level down.Hypoglycaemia is when the sugar level in the blood is very low.\u00a0\u00a0You don't have to be a diabetic to suffer from this.\u00a0\u00a0 To remedy this problem is to eat or drink something to bring your sugar levels up again.\u00a0\u00a0Although sugary foods will spike the blood sugar up very quickly which OK initially in a hypoglycaemic attack, it is better to eat slow energy release food.Urine and blood tests for diabetes only show up if the level of sugar is above a certain limit.\u00a0\u00a0But you can still have prediabetes symptoms and this can still damage nerves.There is a blood test for diabetes that measures the blood for the average sugar level over a 3 month period.\u00a0\u00a0Can't remember what this test is called at the moment.Best wishes.",

    "question": "I am a 35 YO male who has had multiple abdominal hernia surgeries -- three mesh repairs and one nissen fundoplication.\u00a0\u00a0Ever since the surgeries, I'm either reacting to or more sensitive to sugar.Within 2-3 minutes of ingestion of anything containing >2-3 grams of sugar, I receive symptoms of (always) stomach gas and LOUD stomach noises, nausea, abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea (always); itchy face or scalp (usually); headaches and tiredness (occasionally).I've been able to control this all with a very restrictive diet.\u00a0\u00a0Carbs don't seem to be an issue (because they take longer to break down..?), and neither does sugar from fruits.\u00a0\u00a0HFCS is the worst and causes the most immediate problems; cane sugar takes a few more minutes.So here is my question....\u00a0\u00a0With all of the searching I've done, I've not been able to find any justification for my sensitivity, nor have I really heard of anyone else talk about it.\u00a0\u00a0I think this has been a lifelong issue, but the nissen caused me to be more aware, since I can't burp normally.\u00a0\u00a0(I'd always had an aversion to sweet things -- ice cream always caused problems, so did jello.\u00a0\u00a0I always assumed I was lactose and gelatin intolerant..).Because symptoms spring about so immediately (like an allergy) and my symptoms are more than GI-related, I can't imagine it's just an intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0But if anyone else has any advice, I'd greatly appreciate it!",
