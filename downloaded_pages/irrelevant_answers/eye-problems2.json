            "answer": "Cataracts are the usual cause. I think they are caused by low oxygen getting to the eye's....you will need to look that one up. If it is a temparary condition it is cause by low blood sugar. For years I had this problem and still do from time to time. I have low blood sugar naturaly so I foloow a diabetic diet to even out my blood sugar. When my eye gets like that, I know I need to eat something sweet ( fruit) and that resolves the problem. What you don't want is having to do that all day long. Eat healthy choices all day and you will not have that issue. I say this, but also note if you have blood sugar issues you might need to look at the medications your taking as well.",
