            "answer": "Because of her age, she might need a different diet. I think it's time to focus on your cat's nutrition. A lot of kitties do well on prescription diets. You will have to take her to the vet to get her assessed. Make sure she doesn't have any health conditions and that it is just age related..and I'm almost certain they will want to give you foods for her sensitive stomach and age. But, I do think you need to take her in. At 13 years...a lot of kitties lose weight, and we tend to get worried. Because we don't know what her problem really is, a vet is the best option here.Good luck with your kitty. Let us know how she continues to do.",
