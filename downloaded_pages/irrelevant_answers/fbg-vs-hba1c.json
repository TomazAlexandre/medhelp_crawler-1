            "answer": "A1C is the method now used for diagnosing diabetes and you are under the figure currently used by most doctors which is 5.7 to diagnose pre-diabetes. Your fasting numbers are just over that designation which says normal is under 100. Panic? No. But I would keep an eye on it and make lifestyle changes such as losing weight, eating less carbs and eliminating sugar and getting regular exercise.",

    "question": "Hello. I posted a few weeks ago regarding concern about my bloog glucose. To sum up, I had never had a fasting blood glucose, have diabetes in my family, so decided to get a home monitor, see where I stood (given I am still in my 20's but not in good shape - getting there, exercising now, but wanted a baseline). So I hadn't been getting goog night sleep due to work, but checked it a few times in a week (in morning, after a 10-14 hour fast fort those morning tests) and generally got 103, 104 for most. Mornings. So this put me into a HUGE panic about pre-diabetes, and went to a clinic (unable to get to a dr./endocrine dr. Due to insurance) to get a hba1c.So I got the hba1c back (only about a week or so after the 103,104 readings) and the test (hba1c) came back 5.1 (which the clinic doc said, \"no worry for diabetes. You can relax\". Is this true...what about conflicting problem w/the 103,104 fasting, and a 5.1 hba1c? Is that still diabetes/am I fine based on that? He did mention I am a bigger guy, a 103,104 (and with that hba1c) is fine. Should I take that advice.Have to say I was happy when I got the hba1c result, but now was a little puzzled. Any advice is much appreciated.Also, could the 103, 104 FBG on the home monitor have been affected by stress and testing at 515, 530 am? Both of which is how I was testing my fasting blood glucose.Thanks for help.",
