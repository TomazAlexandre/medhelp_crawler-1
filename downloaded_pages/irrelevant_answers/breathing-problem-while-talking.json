            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause symptoms of breathlessness. The breathlessness could also be due to cardiac or lung disorders. So please consult your primary care physician who may ask for an EKG or a treadmill test to rule out a cardiac cause for the pain. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
