            "answer": "The main thing is keeping your blood sugar under control, because it's the elevated blood sugar levels that are causing the damage to the nerves and blood vessels, which is probably contributing to your problem.So, yes, anything you can do to keep your diabetes in check will probably help. Staying active is really important because it can also help keep the arteries clear and exercise produces new blood capillaries in your system. Losing weight will help because that will help you keep the diabetes under control. Many folks who lose weight end up needing less diabetes medication.I know this isn't a diet forum, but if you haven't already, you might want to try a low-carb diet because decreasing the carbs in your diet can help to stabilize your blood sugar. Calories still count on a low carb diet, but because you're eating a higher proportion of protein and fat, and fewer carbs, it might keep you satiated on fewer calories. That is generally how people lose weight, or keep it off, on low carb diets.With diabetes, the main thing is to keep it from progressing because the effects are cumulative and can cause lots of problems.So you're on\u00a0\u00a0the right track with losing weight. I'd also make sure you're getting regular exercise. And let your doctor know you are doing all this so (s)he can monitor you.The oral medications (Viagra, etc.) are not the only ways to deal with erectile dysfunction. There is supposedly a suppository that you can insert inside the tip of your peen that works like the other medications, although I'm not real familiar with it. You can ask your doctor about it, or find it on google maybe.Anyway, I don't know if this helps. There is also a diabetes forum here where you can get more information (if you haven't already), and a urology forum.Recognizing the problem is the first step - and you seem to have done that, so definitely let your doctor know if you undergo a weight loss plan. Good luck!",

            "answer": "John, There are many things you can do. First as a T2 you need to have an excellentdiet using foods with a low Glycemic Index. Use alternative for protein like frozen or canned soybeans. Minimize your animal protein intake to 10% or lower. Eat a varietyof fruits and vegetables everyday. Twice daily have a high fiber cereal like ALLBran Budswith soy or rice milk. Consume very little Alcohol and start an exercise program thatstarts to get those pounds off. Supplements like the Ginseng Berry and Mulberry Leafare proven to help people who are T2, but without the other lifestyle changes forget it.In the short term check out the root vegetable called MACA, it's available in capsulesat your local health food store, that will put more lead in the pencil for now.GoodLuckPeter",
