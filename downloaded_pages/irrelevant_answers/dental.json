            "answer": "oh bless her dear heart...21 yrs old, you've been a good kitty mom to keep your adorable baby doing so well and living such a good life...unfortunately now she is at the age when she requires more senior care and perhaps diet....what is the holistic diet she is on?I agree the excessive drinking can be a sign of diabetes, that along with increased appetite can also be a warning sign of Hyperthyroid....both are not uncommon with age.I would have her tested for both. Feed her a high quality can food, with her loss of teeth it will be difficult to chew anything else. I will give you a link to info on nutrition, and on the right hand side you will see a link to 'commercial cat food brands'http://www.catinfo.org/good luck and let us know how she is doing....\u2665",

            "answer": "rinking a lot of water can be diabetes insipidus. Also called \"Water Diabetes\". I hear that isn't so bad, but the really important thing about it is that water should always be available and they should drink as much as they need, and they can carry on OK for years like that so long as they aren't denied water or they get dangerously dehydrated.Testing her blood and urine might be a good thing? See what's going on, because if it is diabetes insipidus it's best to know as dehydration can be a threat.Otherwise she sounds like she's doing brilliantly well....way to go kitty! 21 and looking beautiful!My dog is always hungry too. She's just always been like that as far back as you can count! She is a greedy-pig. No thyroid issues, just loves food!",
