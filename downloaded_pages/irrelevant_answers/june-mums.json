            "answer": "I am only 16 weeks and I went for the 1 hour test at 10 weeks. It came back at 156 so I went for the 3 hour test. I passed the 3 hour test fine so I have to repeat the test at 20 weeks. I was tested so early because I was borderline with my daughter. I failed the one hour with her and only failed one of the three, on the three hour test. Hope this makes sense. Since I was borderline with my daughter they just had me watch my sugar intake. If I were you I would start doing that now!",
