            "answer": "On a normal day I only eat one meal and that is dinner. I calculated one of my normal meals to be arround 450 calories. Throughout the day I only allow myself one glass of milk, one glass of juice, and one coke(if I have any) or one glass of tea. The rest is water. However, about once a week I eat lunch with my mother so this raises my calorie intake. I also have 2 small children so I am constantly chasing after them so I know I am getting enough exercise. I just don't think I was meant to lose weight. If anyone else has any ideas please tell me.",

    "question": "After taking phentermine for almost 2 months I still have not lost much weight. I heard an ad for banital on the radio and am wondering if I should switch to it or stay on the phentermine for another couple of months to see if will work better. I know that you shouldn't take the banital if you have diabetes, are allergic to shellfish, or are pregnant or nursing; I am none of these. Also I do not have high blood pressure or cholesterol. So should I try the banital or not?",
