            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. But your symptoms are unlikely to be due to brain cancer. The light headedness may happen if there is inadequate supply of oxygen to the brain. This can happen with cardiac disorders or lung disorders.\u00a0\u00a0In cardiac disorders there is inadequate pumping of blood and in lung disorders there is inadequate oxygenation. It could also be due peripheral arterial blood disorders. Symptoms are usually aggravated with exercise in cardiac disorders. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension can cause these symptoms. Again inadequate sleep, hypoglycemia, anemia and vitamin deficiencies can aggravate you symptoms of light headedness.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to consult your primary care physician for a proper evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
