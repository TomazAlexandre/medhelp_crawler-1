            "answer": "Dear Nelpe:Thanks for thinking about us and how are you doing? My wife did not push through with Topotecan as advised by her Onc on the first week of October to shrink two(2) suspected tumors. Instead we got a second opinion from her OB gyn within the same hospital that she may be a candidate for surgery despite a normal Ca 125. This is the same opinion of Dr. Goodman in the medical side of this forum to improve prognosis when I posted the question as to whether 2nd cytoreduction improves prognosis.She just finished her Pet Ct scan last Friday and are awaiting for results to confirm those masses. She will have colonoscopy on Monday just to check since the masses are close to the colon.So there you are. She is free on chemo right now and is gathering strength for the \"next battle\". I think the goal right now for anybody with ov ca is that it can be reduced from life threatening to just that of being chronic like diabetes.Time is important because of the nature of the disease. Time makes previous chemo work again. It also opens up new hope for new drugs on clinical trial to be confirmed and FDA approve.I haven't heard of Art Robinson not even on Goggles. Is he connected to Ovarian research? But Nelpe watch out for this: I think TELOMERASE would be the next big thing in fighting cancers. It was the overeaching theme at last month's meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco.If SueG and Plady is reading this post, I send my regards to them. Please pray for my wife and I have already prayed for the people in this forum.Thank you.Jatoo",
