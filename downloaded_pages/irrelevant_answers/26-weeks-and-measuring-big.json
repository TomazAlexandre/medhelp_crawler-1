            "answer": "Im 26 wks measuring 28.\u00a0\u00a0My doc said a couple wks is nothing to be alarmed about.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have gestational diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Women w/gestational diabetes tend to have bigger babies.\u00a0\u00a0Ive read that about plus sized women too....but I think thats ****. I honestly think every baby grows at a little different pace thats why they all come out different sizes. So maybe you are just going to have a big healthy baby!!! :-)Ericka",

            "answer": "Hi there,when I was 34 weeks at my check up I measured 37 weeks~ they ordered a US and it came back that my amnomic fluid has increased and was high dr. said it was at the high side of normal and did not explain other than many reasons could cause this to happen, not sure this is what yours is .... but I am sure your drs will keep an eye on it. There are many reason as now have been told and some not so pleasant, if\u00a0\u00a0it is your fluid they usually will just watch you more closely ..Then yep...it could be you are further along or just a baby! I had a big baby for 5 weeks early too =)Best of luck not to much longer to go !!!!",

            "answer": "I measured 3 weeks ahead for the last 3 months of my pregnancy. the U/S showed I was carrying a big baby. No Diabetes before or after. I gave birth via C-Sec to a very healthy 10.5 lb boy a week and a half past my due date. he never dropped so they took him out. During the last U/S they warned me he was a good 9-9.5 lbs....He surprised even the Dr's at 10.5. I'm sure there is nothing to worry about. How big was your husband at birth? His Family? Your family? I was only 6.5 at birth, but my husband and all his siblings were 9+, my dad and all 4 of his brothers 10+, my sister was 9.5 so after a little family research, I am pretty sure I was the fluke at 6.5!",
