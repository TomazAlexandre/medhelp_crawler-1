            "answer": "I was put on suboxone for over a year by a pain management doctor, it was 2 mg. I told them I wanted off and back on Perocet and they refused. I was going to sleep at work and at redlights, sometimes just driving. It was a workman's comp situtation, so I stopped going to pain management. I thought for a while I was dying, I went to my primary doctor and he told me how to taper off suboxone and start the Perocet back. Within two months I went in for blood work, I had thyroid problems, low iron. I was also having severe pain in my feet, I couldn't walk for a couple of weeks and then I started trips to the ER with severe stomach pain. They call for a colonostpy and upper GI and nothing was found. No one in my family has ever had thyroid problems. Over a year later, I'm still on thyroid and Iron meds. The stomach pain last for months.",
