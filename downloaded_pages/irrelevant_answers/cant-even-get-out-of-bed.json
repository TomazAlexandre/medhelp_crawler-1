            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.If with movement you are getting pain it is likely to be an inflammation of the skin, subcutaneous tissue or the bone. This can happen with injury, repetitive activity or an infection of the skin. Sometimes it can be costo-chondritis, inflammation of the sterna rib junction. The symptoms of tiredness, nausea and dizziness can also occur with anemia, diabetes and hypothyroidism. A simple blood test can rule out these disorders. Only a consultation with your primary care physician can help diagnose.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
