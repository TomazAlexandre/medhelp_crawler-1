    "question": "Hello,I am in my late 20s. I have struggled with severe bulimia for about 5 years (ED history long before that). My current problem may or may not be related to that, but I ned some input here. About 3 years ago I worked long hours on the computer for several months on a daily basis - that's when I noticed pain in the bottoms of my thighs and they would swell up nightly. I took diuretics and got a lot of movement and the swelling didn't bother me at all. Then, about 2 years ago, I had to work long hours on the computer again and it started over. Again, after getting more movement it went away. Last year I did many hours of daily driving and the pain in my thighs and the swelling came back. It was only slight until I started working in an office in a sedentary job in the fall. That is also around the time my bulimia flared up worse than ever. Now, my legs swell enormously every day. They look huge and feel very tight and uncomfortable. I can hardly sit in a chair for longer than half an hour before the slight pain and discomfort comes, and then I start having this \"worms under my skin\" feeling in my thighs as well as my calves. I know I need to drink more but don't. I suspect my body is retaining lots of water and I feel very uncomfortable in my skin. I am slightly overweight but not extremely. I am quite frustrated about this problem. I have no time nor desire to see a doctor, esp. because there is such a lack of choice where I live. Can you suggest what might be wrong - the cause of the swelling? And what might it affect? How can I treat it? Yes, I know I should go to the doctor. I am just looking for some ideas. Please help. Thank you,DG",
