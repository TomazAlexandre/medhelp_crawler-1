            "answer": "Hi,Remember that the heart is a powerful muscle that each time it beats, produces a force equal to when you squeeze a tennis ball with your hand (not sure if you do that, but anyway..) :)Depending on your body position, the contractions may be felt different places in your chest, and you also have lots of arteries in the chest which may temporarily push towards other tissue, also depending on body position. Palpitations may also make this effect stronger.Keep up the good work with weight loss and keep your blood pressure under control. Maybe that would prevent you from getting diabetes too.If you get other symptoms, see your doctor, of course.",
