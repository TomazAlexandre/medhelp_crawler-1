            "answer": "I am not sure if the high sugar levels can affect fertility. I know with PCOS the reason you get cysts on the ovaries is because of high blood sugar which is from something called insulin resistence which can present a lot like diabeties. I am not sure if actual diabeties can affect you in the same way. Any doctor will tell you that 2 months is not a long time to be trying and depending on your age you should wait 6 to 12 months before seeing a fertility doctor. I don't think the reasons for you c section would cause you problems but I do know if there is too much scar tissue that can cause problems with the egg implanting. Give it a few more months and see what happen. Good luck",
