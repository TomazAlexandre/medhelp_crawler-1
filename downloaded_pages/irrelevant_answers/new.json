            "answer": "Like Super_sally888 says, you do not have to have snacks before bedtime.If her sugar levels drop low before she goes to bed at night, then that would be the time to have a snack, otherwise if she is not hungry, she can miss that out.As your mum has only recently been diagnosed, her medication will need to be monitored and adjusted to suit her.\u00a0\u00a0Her doctor should have given her a chart and instructions when to monitor her blood sugars to see how she is getting on.\u00a0\u00a0Tell your mum to ask her doctor for a referral a dietician who specialises in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There is lots of information on the web too.The types of foods to avoid are all sugary and processed foods.\u00a0\u00a0High fibre foods, nuts, seeds, meats are slow release.\u00a0\u00a0Cut down on saturated fats as this can spike up sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Doing some form of exercise will help to burn the energy.",
