            "answer": "People with hep C are at an elevated risk for type II diabetes. I don't think it is anything to be scared about. You might want to talk to a nutritionist to help guide you in making healthy choices. The best thing to do is avoid a lot of carbohydrates as they are sugars and will elevate your glucose. Have your A1C test as recommended by your physician. You should be just finhel. I am! :-)",

            "answer": "Have you heard about the relatively new treatment ta for hep c?You should ask your doctor about getting treated if you still have hep c. The new meds have about a 98% cure rate for hep c. Treatment could be as simple as 1 pill a day for 8 or 12 weeks and your hep c can be cured. Most people who have treated with the new medicines have had little in the way of side effects.I treated 3 times in the past with interferon based treatments and have had liver cirrhosis for over 9 years. I was cured of hep c by the new medicines 2.5 years ago.Good luck",
