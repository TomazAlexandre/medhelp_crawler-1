            "answer": "I don't know much in regard to your question... but I think you should try to pinpoint what exactly is giving you gas and eliminate the problem.Do you find you eat alot of dairy/refined wheat products? These foods are known to cause terrible gas. Sometimes if people eat alot of fiber all at once, they can develop flatulence and bloatedness. If you think this is from fiber, maybe cut back and gradually increase your fiber intake.As far as treating it goes, I found another forum which may be of some help:http://www.myhomeremedies.com/topic.cgi?topicid=89Maybe you should try ginger/peppermint/chamomile tea (I use these teas when I am having gastrointestinal issues). I don't know what medications diabetics can take, but I believe that these teas are relatively low in carbohydrates and shouldn't hurt your blood sugar levels... But, you should probably consult a pharmacist before you try treating your gas with anything, even tea, just to ensure that there aren't any possible interactions with your medications/ your diabetes.",

            "answer": "I think that you might be able to take gas-x. Not 100% positive but I would talk to your dr. if it is causing you that much pain. My husband is borderline diabetic and was on coumadin and he would take it. Hope this helps!",
