            "answer": "Always happy to try to help but this time I don't know if I can add anything!\u00a0\u00a0Your vet seems pretty thorough!Well,\u00a0\u00a0the vomiting does not fit with diabetes insipidus, and neither is the sudden onset, but it could fit with a urinary tract infection, or early kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0Your dog's body may be trying to dilute out a current infection by increasing thirst.\u00a0\u00a0The urinalysis may not show anything simply since any abnormality is too diluted out.\u00a0\u00a0This goes for blood, bacteria and other abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0 An eight hour water deprivation may not be long enough to change a urinary specific gravity.If a bladder and abdominal X-Ray has not been performed than it should be. It is great that a urine culture and sensitivity is pending, and I would have the abdominal ultrasound performed.\u00a0\u00a0Even though a test\u00a0\u00a0for hyperadrenocorticism was performed a couple of years ago I think that it would be a good idea to repeat it since a lot can change in a couple of years for a dog with their accelerated life spans.\u00a0\u00a0It would not hurt to test for diabetes insipidus either.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes Insipidus can occur with other diseases and is very controllable with Desmopressin Acetate.\u00a0\u00a0The cognitive disorder drug Anipryl can also be helpful for polyuria/polydipsia (excessive drinking and urination) as it's side-effect.Another uncommon possibility is psychogenic polydipsia and just means that your dog may have a behavioral drinking problem.This is a tough one and when all else fails in traditional veterinary medicine than maybe a consultation with a holistic vet may shed additional light on the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I would exhaust all the current traditional tests first though.Please let us know the results of the tests!",

    "question": "I'm sorry to pick your brain again, Dr. Cheng.Jake, our 8 y/o neutered male Dobe has yet another UTI diagnosed yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0This time, he presented with vomiting a couple times a day for 2-3 weeks, excessive water drinking, and excessive urination.\u00a0\u00a0(He's had repeated infections before, but those were very obvious with bloody urine and frequent, small accidents).This time we're pretty stumped b/c of the appearance of his urine. No blood at all in it. It is highly, highly dilute, even when his water intake is restricted.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, the vomiting shouldn't be going on.\u00a0\u00a0The vet is a bit mystified by it.\u00a0\u00a0All his chemistries (he had an extensive panel) came back completely normal yesterday. CBC only showed an elevated WBC.\u00a0\u00a0Culture is pending so he's on Clavamox starting today.Why would his urine be so dilute?\u00a0\u00a0I can understand it when he's drinking a lot, but I deliberately withheld water for 8 hours prior to his UA yesterday, and the specific gravity was 1.002!\u00a0\u00a0He acts desperate for water.Our plan is to see how he does with the Clavamox, and then to investigate furthur with an ultrasound if he is still displaying symptoms after treatment.\u00a0\u00a0We're trying Pepcid for the vomiting, but it hasn't helped when I tried a few days ago.\u00a0\u00a0His appetite, activity, coat, and poops are totally normal.Any great ideas?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you in advance.",
