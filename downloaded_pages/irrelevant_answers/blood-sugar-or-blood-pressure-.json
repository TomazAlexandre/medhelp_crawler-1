            "answer": "How many weeks are you? Could just be a stomach bug or morning sickness. I would treat it like a bug, broth,crackers 7up and for sure electrolytes and water. It never hurts to call your mid wife even if you have an appt tomorrow.",

            "answer": "It sounds like it could possibly be blood sugar, but i would have thought eating would help, not hurt. I sometimes have low blood pressure and it doesn't make me shake. It does cause the other stuff though. But a few times my sugar has been super low and that DID make me shake. Also causes the other stuff. Food helped after a few minutes. I dont remember eating ever making my bp worse. All bodies are different though. Might be a sickness. Really hard to say from a distance. Would definitely ask midwife.",

            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes and when my sugar is high, my chest hurts, I get shaky a little, and see dark spots so it's possibly your sugar and that could be why eating makes it worse.",

    "question": "Have my midwife apt tomorrow. But I have been shaking really bad, foggy, light headed and feel like passing out. Tried eating something but it made it worse. Had digestional diabetes with my daughter and my sugar always plummeted and I would pass out. Often landing into a wall or other hard objects but apparently this is different becAuse when I did eat something it made it worse.I don't want to call my midwife as I have an apt tomorrow. But if you ladies have the same problem as this that would be helpful. Please no rude comments.. Emotional already. Thanks!",
