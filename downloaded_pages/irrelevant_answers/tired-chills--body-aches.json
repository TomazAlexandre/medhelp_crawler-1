            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you had a recent illness in the past, then this could be due to post viral fatigue syndrome. This can be treated patiently with exercise, good diet, work out plans and multivitamins. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and proteins should be taken along with a multi vitamin supplement. Eat 5-7 small regular meals every day. Drink plenty of water. Do deep breathing exercises.Otherwise this could be due to low thyroid function, anemia or diabetes. Please consult your PCP and get blood tests done to rule these out. Hope this helps. Take care!",
