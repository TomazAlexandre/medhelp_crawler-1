            "answer": "Hello !I am 15 year old male and experience a strange problem. On the 3rd of January I visited my ophtalmologist, who completed an exam with a slit lamp and an ophtalmoscope. He also completed a refractometry. Everything was OK. But litteraly one week after I started experiancing glare and halo at night. I recently developed ghost images(but only if i am thinking about it). The glare and halo appears on street and fludlights. I think i am experiencing less and less every day. What would be the cause of the phenomena. I am otherwise healthy, do have some anxiety, but didnt get enough sleep. I am under stress. The ghost images appear maybe every 3-5 days-if i think about them of course. I had some problems when I broke up with my girlfriend, and that caused the stress. Any ideas",

The other thing is that if i put off my glasses i wont see the starburst effect, but i will have problems(as my diopter is D- 2,20 in the right eye and -2,00 in left).The other question is. I do not have ghosting-but is very miled(i do not see this every day !) and very rearly see it(In both eyes of course(, i did notice a strange phenomena do. I can see well (but lets say the veihcle registration signs) can be a bit blurry-astigmatism symptom. But if i adjust my glasses a bit(putting and holding them above my nose) i do not see this bluriness. It is strange and only in ONE EYE ! The other thing is that i noticed all these symptoms after having anxiety attacks. But as I say better to be safe than sorry and if the cornea specialist(one of the best ones in my area) does not find anything i am going to a psychiatrist ASAP !",
