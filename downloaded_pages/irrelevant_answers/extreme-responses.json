I had some shock tests on my limbs a couple days ago, but they didn't tell me anything. I'm wondering if my reflexes were normal. (Although I could tell that I did not reflex at all in one spot.) I won't get the results for another two weeks and the suspense is killing me.",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Involuntary muscle jerks can occur due to many causes like hypocalcemia, dehydration, diabetes, and encephalopathy.It is very difficult to tell without a physical examination. Since all your tests are normal, hypocalcemia can be a cause in your case.You can take calcium supplements and see if it makes you feel better. Take care!",
