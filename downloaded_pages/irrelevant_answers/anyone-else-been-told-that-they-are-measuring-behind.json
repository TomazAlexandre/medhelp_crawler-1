            "answer": "I was told for the first time a couple of days ago, it was the first time I was actually measured though. I'm 36+6 today, she said I'm measuring about 32wks so sent me for an ultrasound yesterday. Tech said everything looks fine with growth and exact measurements will go to Dr next wk. So looks like everything is fine, my first two were 6lb 12 and 7lb 11, and both overdue so no hope here for an early or smallish baby lol",

            "answer": "I'm due tommarow and my tummy measures 7 inches off but the baby on the ultrasound is mesuring 7.5 and they said he's healthy so I guess it just depends on your body stucture and if your body stretches? My first son I was measured way under but he came out to be 8 1/2 pounds and 23 inches. Hes healthy too.just long and thin",
