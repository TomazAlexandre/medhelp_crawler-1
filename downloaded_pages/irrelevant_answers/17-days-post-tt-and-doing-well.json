            "answer": "Glad to hear you are doing well post surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I am 14 days out from surgery 1 and 7 days from surgery 2 (I was such a good patient that I got to do it twice). What a great idea to send a gift to your physician. I had been in to my primary physician several times, and nobody found the nodule until I went to the ENT for something else. It was a very soft nodule (lots of cystic components) and you really had to work to feel it, although it was large enough to be seen. Maybe I could send him a thank you card. He referred me to one of his partners who specializes in thyroid surgery, but he assisted. Actually, I think I will send both of them something.Thanks for a terrific idea and I hope you continue to do well.Jo",

    "question": "Just noticed a post from Darla and her success after TT.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I'd add one in two. I had mine August 30 and am also doing fine.\u00a0\u00a0I think the successes should be heralded since I know prior to mine, I scanned a lot of boards looking for people's experiences.\u00a0\u00a0For a while it seemed there weren't a lot of good ones.Dr. Mark said in one, that most people don't write when things go well, so sometimes it makes it look like the frequency of complications is more than it is.Anyway, mine was a TT due to nodules on both lobes, one of which was about 1CM that looked 'highly suspicious,' the other two were .9 and .7. One was cystic, the other 'suspicious.' The first and second opinion labs couldn't agree on what type, follicular or papillary.Even with insulin dependent diabetes, I had a good surgery with no complications. Was very sore, and am still a little hoarse.\u00a0\u00a0It was difficult to swallow for about a week, often felt like something stuck in my throat, but was more of an annoyance than anything else.Path came back as papillary carcinoma, one nodule had begun to grow outside of the thyroid, so I'm glad they got it out.\u00a0\u00a0There were two other spots in addition to the other nodules.Am on 100 mcg of Synthroid, and feel great.Am meeting with Radiation Oncologist on Friday to plan RAI ablation treatment.\u00a0\u00a0They will be using Thyrogen, rather than withdrawal from thyroid. Although this is an 'off the box' method still I think, it is being done standardly at major places such as Univ of Penn, etc.I went back to work after about 9 days.Sent a plant to my endo who had discovered the lumps.\u00a0\u00a0This was significant, since I had just been at my GP 2 weeks before, and my former endo three months before!",
