As far as placement, I just stick my pump in my pocket when I workout and that doesn't seem to be a problem.\u00a0\u00a0I would say experiment with what works for you, but definitely don't stop your exercise routine because of the pump.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the inspiration.\u00a0\u00a0A friend of mine teaches an abs class and I may just get back on track. Good Luck to you!ES",

            "answer": "I agree with ES.\u00a0\u00a0IN recent months I've been doing much better about getting regular exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I've found that disconnecting works better for me since I thought I was noticing some degradation -- not at the infusion site, but in the insulin itself after getting shaken, rocks & rolled while I'm doing aerobic exercise.If my BG is within my pre-exercise target range, I just disconnect and exercise away.\u00a0\u00a0If I'm lower, I eat a bit and if I'm higher I bolus a bit -- but I reduce the bolus knowing I'll be exercising.\u00a0\u00a0I do test quite a bit on exercise days cuz sometimes I run high a few hours later -- probably due to having cut off the basal for a while.\u00a0\u00a0I just correct and get on with life.Probably, I should work with an exercise specialist to better tune up what I do.\u00a0\u00a0There is no good reason we should \"pay for exercise\" with a high ...",
