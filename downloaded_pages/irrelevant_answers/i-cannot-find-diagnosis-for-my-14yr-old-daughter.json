            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum! I am sorry to hear about your daughter.It sounds like chronic fatigue syndrome. Other possibilities are anemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes, disorders of the hypothalamus, psychiatric disorders like depression and sleep-related disorders. Is there a loss of weight? If there is loss of weight, that would explain decrease in breast size. Otherwise development of secondary sexual characters and female hormone levels should be checked. I feel that a thorough clinical examination and investigations are needed to rule them out one by one and reach a confirmatory diagnosis.It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please let me know what your doctors think it is. Do let me know if there is any thing else. Take care!",

MIght want to think about having her checked for hormone levels also.I will pray for you to find the perfect treatment, caring professionals, and correct circumstances to come forward to assist your daughter in a proper diagnosis and healing.",
