            "answer": "I have is problem as well. I had a roux-en-y gastric bypass and due to scar tissue I have dysphasia.I am currently 22 weeks pregnant and have gained 7.8 lbs so far.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that it is okay not to gain too much weight during pregnancy. That the baby will take what it needs first, then you get what is left over. So you don't have to worry so much about baby.I eat the same things as you, minus the peanut butter, since I am allergic.I eat a lot of soup, and salads as well. All you can do is e best you can. Maybe see a nutritionist if you are really concerned.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply!\u00a0\u00a0I wish you well on your pregnancy!I was nervous because I'm told I need to gain at least 25 pds because I am thin. On top of that, I have this dysphagia to deal with. I'm also doing exercises to help my tongue and swallowing as well.I was told that it really isn't too hard to gain weight when your pregnant. But I bought some books on what to eat and they're helpful. I've also purchased a few books on cooking for baby, and if I need to puree foods to eat more then I will have to.What worries me is that due to my dysphagia that I might have to stick with the same foods every day, and as a result not provide my baby with \"all\" necessary nutrients. I'm taking prenatals (chewables) and folic acid.I will speak to my doctor about seeing a nutrionist if I have to. The good thing is my doctor thinks I'm healthy and fine.",

            "answer": "As long as you are getting your prenatal vitamins, and folic acid..... And trying to eat the best you can, I think everything will be okay. It might be a good idea to supplement with protein shakes. There is a drink that you can buy that is for pregnant women, it is called similar mom. I just got a sample of it and I am going to see what it is like. If it is good, then I think I will buy some.\u00a0\u00a0It is a meal replacement drink.Definately check with your doctor on what he thinks. But I know lots of thin woman that have healthy babies. Don't get discouraged.Are you currently pregnant? Or trying to get pregnant?",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with mild dysphagia. I have difficulty with things like steak, dry chicken, even multi-texture foods like sandwhiches, raw veggies to name a few.I can eat peanut butter & jelly, ground meat burgers (w/o buns), eggs, and such, anything soft natured. I can eat other things as well, just giving you some idea.I would like to gather some info and study some things before seeing my doctor next week.What I want to know is, how easy/difficult will it be to gain weight for my pregnancy as a result of my mild dysphagia? More importantly, how can I modify my diet to feed my baby well and as much as I can.I know all about the smoothies and fruit juices that I will add to my diet...the concern with that is, will my blood sugar skyrocket as a result? I don';t have high blood sugar, or diabetes but I've been reading about gestational diabetes during the second semester or so, and I don't want to go through that.I can eat pistachios and nuts, one at a time, slowly, but are we allowed to eat nuts during pregnancy?Raw veggies are a bit difficult, but I can always puree that & make it soup.I eat ground meats, chicken, pork, beef with spagetti, for example, but is too much pasta not recommended? If I need to eat that every other day, I'll do it.But has anyone suffered from dysphagia during pregnancy? How did you modify your diet? I'm in my mid thirties as it is, and the last thing I want is to have an underweight baby or make it suffer in any way because of my issue, even as it is diagnosed as mild by my doctor.",
