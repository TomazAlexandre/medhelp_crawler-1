            "answer": "Being skinny is great. There's no doubt, but eventually, this hyperthyroidism will wear on your heart. Not good.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know your ranges for your frees, as every lab uses different ranges. Your TSH is low. If your thyroid is swollen, then over time, it will only get worse. Don't wait until your heart is beating so fast that it is difficult to breathe and the anxiety makes you have a mental breakdown.After surgery, make sure you find an endo who specializes in thyroid, not diabetes. Post your levels, as well as the current levels of your thyroid medication. The reason so many hypos have a difficult time losing weight is that their endos (probably diabetes specialists) treat their TSH and ignore the frees, which are far more important.My old endo was like that. She refused to raise my meds, and I was still hypo and unable to lose weight. My new endo has bumped my meds high enough. I am finally losing weight! 2 pounds just this week.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "I agree that we need to know the reference ranges for the FT's, in order to see where your results fall within the range.\u00a0\u00a0And yes, being skinny is nice, but being hyper is dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0You will most likely keep getting worse and worse; and yes, if you have to have your thyroid removed, you will end up on replacement thyroid med for the rest of your life.\u00a0\u00a0Not a great thought, but not so bad, once you get used to it...........My endo does happen to specialize in diabetes, but he's also very good with thyroid issues; he DOES believe in testing the FT's and does not go by TSH.\u00a0\u00a0If he were doing that, he would most likely take\u00a0\u00a0me off my med because my TSH is very low (0.01), but instead he just raised my levo dose after my pcp lowered it (because of TSH) and I went hypo again.\u00a0\u00a0I had also been able to lose weight until my pcp sent me back to hypo land -- I gained about 4 pounds in less than a week.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping I'll be able to get rid of them again now with the higher dosage.According to my endo -- symptoms should be treated first.",

            "answer": "The ranges are: TSH: (0.5-4.5) mIU/L, FT4: (10-20) pmol/L, FT3: (3.5-6.0) pmol/LAs you can see from my results above, my TSH is low out of range but my FT4 readings has always been right in the middle and my FT3 reading well within range too. That's why I'm finding it hard to understand, if my FT4 and FT3s are normal, why is my TSH going down?",

    "question": "I have had my thyroid levels monitored for the last few years and here are the results:Mar '06: TSH: 0.52,\u00a0\u00a0 FT4: 14Jun '06: TSH: 0.87,\u00a0\u00a0 FT4: 14Nov '07: TSH: 0.33Nov '07: TSH: 0.44,\u00a0\u00a0FT4: 14,\u00a0\u00a0FT3: 5.3Nov '09: TSH: 0.28,\u00a0\u00a0FT4: 15Dec '09: TSH: 0.24,\u00a0\u00a0FT4: 15,\u00a0\u00a0FT3: 5.1I went for blood tests again this year because I've lost a bit of weight and was concerned by how much hair I was losing and also having a feeling of anxiousness and going to toilet more often. I just but it down to starting a new job and stress etc. Not until the results came back and the doctor said I could have hyperthyroidism. But I don't understand why my TSH levels are low but my FT4 and FT3 levels are right in range.Doctor also sent me for an ultrasound and results came back saying both lobes of the thyroid were slightly enlarged and have tiny nodules.Sent for another blood test for Thyroid Antibodies and the results areAnti-Thyroglobulin Abs: 51 U/mLAnti-Thyroidal Peroxidase Abs: 27 IU/mLHe's referred me onto a surgeon but I'm really scared...surgery? Isn't there other ways to treat my symptoms? Will I have to be on medication for the rest of my life?Does anyone know if I'll gain weight when I take the treatment? It's just apart from the hair loss and feeling anxious I feel great and am really happy with my body at the moment as I've never been this skinny in my life!",
