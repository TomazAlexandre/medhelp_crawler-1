            "answer": "any drug use including smoking can cause you to smell and want to take more than one shower a day. where exactlty on your body is the smell coming from? if its coming from your vaginal area you more than likely have some type of inf3ection down there and need to go to the dr. if its just sweating or under the under arm area try using a stronger deoderant. i know for me i cant use girls deoderant because i sweat through it so i use guys deoderant and now i dont sweat under my arms anymore.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, drug use can be a factor. Body odor is seen in poor hygiene (ruled out in your case) or medical conditions like thyroid disorder, carcinoid syndrome and taking drugs like antidepressant.\u00a0\u00a0Increased sweating due to any cause can also cause unpleasant body odour because microorganism in your body can break sweat into aromatic fatty acids which smell bad. All causes of hyperhydrosis like hyperthyroidism, diabetes, carcinoid syndromes infections etc should be eliminated.Vinegar like smell in sweat is due to an acid called propionic acid. Since this acid is chemically similar to acetic acid in vinegar, the sweat smells of vinegar. This happens due to excess amino acids in sweat (which are breakdown products of protein), seen common with a high protein diet. Also if the diet is rich in cheese, then a bacteria of staphylococcus type acts on the sweat and causes this smell of vinegar. Hence to avoid this smell you would need to carefully look at your diet and lower the protein and cheese content in it.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
