            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Please rule out diabetes and hypothyroidism and also adrenal gland problems. Consult a doctor and run the required tests. If all is fine then you need to find a good fitness instructor and learn abdominal exercises that will help tone up your tummy. Along with it regular exercise as in running, cycling etc will help. A good diet control is also required.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am twenty four years old and I am 5'1 and weigh 147. I have always weighed 120 or 115. In the past year , I have gained weight in my face and in my stomach. You can definitely say I look to be about 4 to 5 months pregnant. But I am not pregnant. I have tried to lose weight and eat healthy but it seems like my stomach is not going anywhere and it is quite embarrassing. I have looked at maybe it being fibroids but I dont have pain in my menstrual cycle. Please someone help me in the right direction.",
