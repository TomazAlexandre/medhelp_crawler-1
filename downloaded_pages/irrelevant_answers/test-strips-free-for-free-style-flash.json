            "answer": "Mariuca,I don't know anything about obtaining financial help with test strips in countries other than the USA, but here in the USA the company that makes the FreeStyle strips has a program that provides FreeStyle strips and lancets (and a meter) free of charge if a person meets all of the income requirements.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe if you contact them they can let you know if any help is available in your country.Here's the link for the FreeStyle strips program information (the program is called the Abbott Diabetes Patient Assistance Program):http://www.needymeds.com/program_list.taf?_function=name&program_id=1047I hope you and your daughter find the help you need, and God Bless You both! :)",
