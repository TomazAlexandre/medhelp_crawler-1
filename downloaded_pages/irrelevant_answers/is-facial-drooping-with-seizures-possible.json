    "question": "PLEASE HELP! My mother was diagnosed with seizures a couple of years ago. Odd to me that before being diagnosed I never witnessed these seizures. After being diagnosed and put on seizure meds she has full tonic clonic seizures at times. At times she has facial droopings with the seizures making it look like TIA's. All tests (EEG, CT, MRI's) have been negative. While she was on Depakote the seizures were still not controlled. Almost feel as if these are not seizures and something serious is wrong but the docs are unable to diagnose her.\u00a0\u00a0She has seen many neurologists and MD's for her condition. Any suggestions or advice? Please offer some good insight. I am a nurse so I am familiar with all that is going on.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!!!",
