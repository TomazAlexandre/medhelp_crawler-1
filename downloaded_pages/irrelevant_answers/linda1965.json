            "answer": "It appears you may be testing too soon after exercise. During exercise your liver release glycogen [store sugar] for needed energy. Testing soon after your meter is capturing leftover/excess glycogen. Give your body time to settle down, then test approx 30-40 mins later.Your 5.8% A1c converts to a daily avergae of 120 mg/dl. If your fasting levels are <100 mg/dl, then what you're eating and drinking is raising your levels. Read my food comments in the thread \"diabetes By pains01\". Good luck -",

            "answer": "Keep up the good work.Hard exercise can temporarily cause a rise in blood sugar.This is normal and doesn't mean you shouldn't be exercising as the benefits far outweight the risk of going slightly higher blood sugar.However, don't take any energy or sports drinks when you exercise like this asyou don't want to cause it to rise further - just plenty of water.Try to follow a lower carb diet (look up Dr. Richard Bernstein, \"Diabetes Solutions\" 2011 Edition) to also help further normalise your blood sugars.Make sure you warm up and cool down.",

    "question": "I was prediabetic but lowered my A1c from 6.6 to 5.8 over 3 months. My fasting blood sugar is usually under 100 now, but I have noticed that if I run 2-3 hard miles before testing, it's 120's and even after running if fasting has been below 100, it goes up to 120's. I thought exercise should bring it down. I am confused about whether I should be running.",
