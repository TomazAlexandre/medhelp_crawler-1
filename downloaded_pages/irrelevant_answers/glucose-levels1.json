            "answer": "\"high for a morning reading at 9.2\"Clarification is needed on what \"morning reading\" means. Did you fast, not eat nor drink any colored liquids 8-10 hours prior to testing?What was the Hba [aka HbA1c, HA1c, or A1c] test result? This is important to know. The value is presented in % [percentile].You stay up until 4am for work or partying?Providing answers will provide a better and fuller response to your concern.Btw, 9.2 mmol/l equates to 165.6 mg/dl, diabetes, IF this was from fasting.",

            "answer": "OK. You can toss out the 9.2 mmol/l test as testing randomly only provides a false positive. Proper glucose test times are:\u2022 Fasting: 1st thing in morning b4 eating or drinking any colored liquids\u2022 Postprandial: 2-3 hours after a mealPost back with your test results exactly how they appear on your copy of the lab sheet. Include the target ranges too, we can take it from there. In the meantime, have a Happy New Year celebration.",

    "question": "I had\u00a0\u00a0a full blood check up last week and my glucose levels came back as high for a morning reading at 9.2. I had some more tests today including a fasting test and a hba something or other. My question is soe this now mean i have diabetes. I am very much a night person regularly up til 4 in the morning and eating and drinking before i go to bed. I am white, not over weight and have no family history. Could my high reading be due to my eating and sleeping pattern even if i had an early night the night before my tests or do you think i have diabetes? thankyouAlso to ot quickly i had previously had a blood test back in 2009 and my morning test was 4.7. however i started uni that year which has changed my waking an sleeping patterb",
