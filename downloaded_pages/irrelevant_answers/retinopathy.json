    "question": "My husband, 38, was diagnosed retinopathy in July 2010. He had never had an issue with his eyes/vision before, but started having \"bright lights\" in field of vision. He says it is like if you were to look at a bright light and look away, but that light is always there for him. He went to the retinal specialist, they did some study where they started an IV, injected something and took pictures of the back of his eye. They then told him it was retinopathy, didn't know why it was happening and should go away on its own. It did get better, but it now has come back and is worse. He has gone to his GP and he wasn't concerned, BP was normal and since it had gone away once before he told him to give it time. I just don't think it is normal, can you suggest anything that we could look into for the cause or treatments for retinopathy?",
