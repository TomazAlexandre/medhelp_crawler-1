            "answer": "Conclusion\"Our study shows that even HCV patients with chronic hepatitis but not cirrhosis have an increased prevalence of gallstones. Compared with the controls, gallstone disease is present in HCV patients at a younger age and in association with central obesity and liver steatosis, and is not related to gallstone heredity, dyslipidaemia, diabetes mellitus or metabolic syndrome. Although we could not establish a temporal relationship, the association between HCV infection and gallstone disease is real and appears to be causally linked at least in predisposed individuals, namely obese and with liver steatosis.\"http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/713180",

    "question": "I'm a 24 year old female and found out that I have Hep C two years ago.\u00a0\u00a0For the past couple months I have had tiny white flecks in my urine that look like skin or tissue.\u00a0\u00a0A few weeks ago, I was having a pretty bad chronic pain in the right side of my back right where my gall bladder is located.\u00a0\u00a0The pain lasted for about a week and then stopped.\u00a0\u00a0It just hit me this morning that these two symptoms may be related because I thought that the pain was in my kidney.\u00a0\u00a0While searching online, I found someone who had the exact same symptoms and ended up having a golf ball sized gall stone removed.\u00a0\u00a0When I saw that, I thought maybe my Hep C had contributed to a gallstone.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been having the waves of very slight pain in the very lowest part of my left front.\u00a0\u00a0The pain happens only when something touches that area.\u00a0\u00a0I have not idea if these things are related or not, but I figured I would throw that in here as well.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any insight into this.",
