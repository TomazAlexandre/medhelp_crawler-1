    "question": "Hiya! (I'm typing this during nite as I can't sleep..typical me!!) For a while I thought there might be something wrong with my hormones but don't want to say addison\u00a0\u00a0just yet because firstly I have PCOS (polycystic ovaries) and i get lots of lower pain with this. Last week was admitted to hospital the pain so severe I thought my appendix needed out. I feel bit better now albeit v.embarassed (feeling I waste their time) :(\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, i'm 25 & dont feel normal. I feel so exhausted i'm sleeping all day and can no longer walk alot (if I do I feel faint and dizzy) All my bloods are normal, no diabetes and now I feel like I have a bad urine infection my urine is always v.hot, drink LOADS yet no infection. The thing that concerns me most is both areas under ribs on each side are very sore its like a constant ache ive had 7+ mnths & docs dont know but it gets so bad I feel sick...painkillers dont help..I'm not the energized happy girl I used to be. Just now I can't sleep have shooting pains in my legs, lower back and have over 10 panic attacks a day..wtf?:(\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to waffle on but with this sick feeling & my period has stopped for 13 months after being like clockwork.\u00a0\u00a0Just now at 2.AM my body thinks it is 2PM and wide awake. Any advice please I've also gotten v .depressed lately cant go on with pain thanks x",
