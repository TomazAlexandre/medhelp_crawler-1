            "answer": "140 is fine. Don't freak out. It's only slightly above normal. I also think the gestational diabetes and the accompanying nutrition classes, blood sugar monitors and medication are a big, fat scam. The fact is, what is considered \"normal\" blood sugar levels have come down dramatically over the years. What was once considered normal and not in need of medical intervention is now considered a problem and there are classes, meds, etc. Personally, I think it's another way for the healthcare system to get our money.",

            "answer": "I would never say 140 is ok.\u00a0\u00a0I would talk to your doctor about medications that will maybe help keep your glucose levels under control.\u00a0\u00a0I rarely advocate for medication, but I would rather you take medication (that is not shown to affect fetuses).\u00a0\u00a0If the medication does not work your only option is insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Continuing with excessive sugar levels can lead to brain development problems, kidney problems (in both you and baby), and overweight babies.\u00a0\u00a0Its not too late to get things under control.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the luck in the world.",

    "question": "My blood sugars for 2 months now have been running around 140 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0I would call my dr.s office and talk to the nurse and she would tell me he checks for gestational at 28 weeks and 140 was ok.Yesterday at my visit with him I brought him all my glucose checks and he told me that I have gestational diabetes and he was not even going to make me take the glucose intolerance test that most people take.\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational 10 years ago with my 2 daughters.\u00a0\u00a0 He gave me a controlled diet menu and wants me to go by that for 1 week to see if my sugars come down, but that is the diet\u00a0\u00a0I have been following for 3 months now because in my heart I new I was diabetic.So my question is I am 24 weeks and could I have damaged my baby with my blood sugars being in the 140's 2 hours after a meal.\u00a0\u00a0I think I have been diabetic from the beginning but those stupid nurses said I was ok.I work at the hospital, 19 years, and I have enough experience to know that something was wrong so I cut all sweets out of my diet at the beginning of this pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I just hope that the baby is not damaged already.",
