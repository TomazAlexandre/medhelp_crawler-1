    "question": "Back in December I started having a slight pain in my left hip.\u00a0\u00a0I thought it was probably due to the cold weather. It was no big deal.\u00a0\u00a0Then about a month ago I was working in my yard and did some heavy lifting that I probably shouldn't have done.\u00a0\u00a0Since that day I have had severe pain in my left hip.\u00a0\u00a0It hurts mostly when I get up after sitting for a while.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is really severe for about 10 steps then the pain decreases to just mild pain.\u00a0\u00a0It hurts to bear any weight on it also.\u00a0\u00a0It's been a good 4 weeks and I keep expecting the pain to subside but it seems to be getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0I also have back pain which I've had for about 4 or 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have muscle spasms in the left side of my back and also burning pain in the middle of my back.\u00a0\u00a0I have some sciatica symptoms but not enough to complain about.\u00a0\u00a0I've also noticed that I have a numb spot on the bottom of my left foot.\u00a0\u00a0In the past 4 or 5 years I have also had chronic muscle pain and fatigue which my doctor told me was probably Fibro.\u00a0\u00a0I take 50 miligrams of Elavil a day and that has pretty much taken away those 2 symptoms by probably 70 or 80 percent.\u00a0\u00a0Almost all of the living women on my dad's side of the family have been diagnosed with some sort of auto-immune disorder (R.A., Lupus,M.S., Thyroid disease), including my sister.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I'm just really looking for someone to point me in the right direction as to what type of doctor I need to see.\u00a0\u00a0Any information would be helpful.",
