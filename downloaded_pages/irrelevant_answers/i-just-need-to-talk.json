            "answer": "Hi Selma,They did an MRI of my brain to rule out MS and brain tumors, and found the non specific lesions. I did have an ANA several years ago that was positive, but they repeated the test and it is now negative. The neuro said he would like to go by my negative because ANA's can be false positive.My fatigue has improved some since taking vitamin D and they put me on a fluid restriction to bring up my sodium level. I think I am just feeling discouraged because I have no answers and I have no idea what to expect in the future. My husband and family are very supportive of me, but they are at a loss like I am. Thanks for responding its nice to have someone to chat with that has been through some of the same things...Marie",

            "answer": "Sort of sounds like a circulation problem to me, altho the vitamin and mineral deficiencies and the neuropathy may be going on, too.\u00a0\u00a0I think you should probably add to your list of solutions to see a cardiologist, and your regular doc ought to check cholesterol and triglyceride levels, and also you should write down what they say your blood pressure is every time you go in there.\u00a0\u00a0When you see the cardio doc, show him your MRI report about the lesions found in your brain, and tell him how your vision goes out and your legs look blue.\u00a0\u00a0Also, at this website, there are heart forums, so you could post your symptoms over there and see if you can find someone else who is familiar from that point of view, too.",

            "answer": "With the lesions on your brain I would still check into MS. Your symptoms sound alot like mne & although I haven't been dxed they're still leaning towards MS. MS is very hard to dx sometimes which is very frustrating for us in limbo. Have you checked out the MS forum here. very wonderful & supportive people there!! Sometimes MS has to get bad before its found. I am in the same boat as you & of course we want nothing to be wrong but know our bodies & know when somethings not right. Unfortunately my family is not as supportive . I hope this helps you , take care & God bless you!",

    "question": "Hi all,I have posted a few times before but I just got back from the neuro today and I am very upset and just need to talk. For the past few years my health has been steadily declining and I am only 31. I have suffered with periodic numbness and tingling in my legs and arms, severe fatigue and my vision coming and going on and off. Recently I have started having memory loss and slurring of my words, and my legs turning dusky bluish, purple on and off. The neuro did some blood tests and a MRI, blood tests are normal (had the standards done such as CBC, CMP, TSH,ESR, VIT D , Ferritin, Iron, also SEP, SIM, Vit B12) with the exception of low sodium and low vit D, and MRI showed non specific white matter lesions in the left frontal lobe. He doesn't know what it is and has no answers for me except to take some medicine for neuropathy and to come see him in 3 months to see how I am doing. I am beginning to think maybe I am crazy because there are no answers. My gut tells me that I have something wrong, but I don't know what to do, and the fear of the unknown is horrible. But then again, I do have objective data suggesting medical issues, so I am at a loss. I am a nurse and a mother and I am afraid if things continue to go this way I will not be able to remember how to do the things that I love like my job and take care my family. Do you think I should go for another opinion? Has any one else experienced anything similar to this? Thanks for your timeMarie",
