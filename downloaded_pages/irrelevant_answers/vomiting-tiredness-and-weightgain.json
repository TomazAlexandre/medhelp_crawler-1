            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Normally, so much of vomiting should cause weight loss. Is the vomiting induced? Otherwise you should explore the possibility of diabetes or hypothyroidism. A simple blood test should help diagnose the two. Also you can look at possible causes of water retention, like kidney or adrenal gland involvement. I do not think your problem is related to your gastrointestinal system. Since you have 12 week waiting period for endoscopy, you have time to explore other options.You need a comprehensive investigation taking all these points in consideration. Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping us posted!If, you are vomiting regularly, continuing to eat and gaining weight, I think you are suffering from bulimia nervosa. As I said earlier, any disorder of your gastrointestinal tract, associated with vomiting will lead to weight loss. If your blood sugar and thyroid levels are ok then you need to seriously consider this option. Talk to your doctor about this.Do let me know if there is any thing else you want to know and please keep me posted. Take care!",
