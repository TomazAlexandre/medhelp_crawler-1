            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The reason it is not healing could be that it is a scaly rash due to atopic or contact dermatitis, psoriasis or even eczema. Hence proper treatment by skin specialist which may take time for complete healing is required.They could be non healing due to underlying infection, low supply of oxygen to the wound that is reducing the healing process, underlying diabetes, or due to underlying dermatitis (as explained). Wounds heal slower in smokers or alcoholics who have been drinking for a long time. So these have to be ruled out.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
