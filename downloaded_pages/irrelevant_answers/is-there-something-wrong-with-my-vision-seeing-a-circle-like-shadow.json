    "question": "I had a case of floaters about a year ago and went to an ophthalmologist and another retinal specialist he referred and they took extensive looks into my eyes for tears or bleeding, both reported to finding nothing. Well about four or five months this problem started in both eyes, where on a bright wall I notice this circle like shadow following my eyes as I move my eyes a certain way and then it just disappears. This happens when I turn my head both sides, I do not see it looking forward and moving my eyes around.When I move my head the shadow can some times go from a circle to a line that protrudes some times its not even a shadow some times it looks like a ball of positive light. It is also directly where my natural blind spot resides. I am not sure if this is a scotma that I just need to learn not to concentrate or something else or at worse a Retinal Detachment. I do not have the money atm to see the doctor again because I have been laid off and currently looking for another job.I am 22 years old, not over weight, had no blows to my eyes, no known diseases been tested for diabetes and nothing, no family history of eye problems. I am astigmatic. Just wanted to ask the doctors opinion on what you guys think this could possibly be?It does not bother me any other time of the day or interfere with my life, only times I tend to notice it is on a very bright lit up wall or a white wall.",
