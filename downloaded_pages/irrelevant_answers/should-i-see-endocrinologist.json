It helps me not to feel the nodule when I swallow but I'm tired all the time and I've gained weight and I get sick very easy and it is hard to get rid of a sickness, it takes 2-3 antibotics just for a cold.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be seeing an Endocrinologist or should I continue seeing just regular physian.\u00a0\u00a0Thank You",
