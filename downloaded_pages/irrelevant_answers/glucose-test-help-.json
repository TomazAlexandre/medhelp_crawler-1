            "answer": "I took it last weekend. They drew my blood at 9. I drank the juice, then they took another vile of blood right at ten, then last vile right at 11. You only drink one juice though. I would say if you have a car to nap in between then do that. You're not allowed to walk around or be up and about. One girl threw up o think she seemed uncomfortable. I took a nap for every hour I waited. Good luck :)",
