            "answer": "Welcome!\u00a0\u00a0Lots to think about. Your dr will know if you're able to take the new triple therapy. It's a weekly injection and 2 other oral meds. The new oral med is what keeps the virus from multiplying as the other 2 drugs team up to wipe it out. I hope you're a candidate for it. Did they give you a MELD score or run any other tests like sonography or endoscopy? Good luck. You can find a ton of good info if you search this site.. Karen ;) keep us posted.",
