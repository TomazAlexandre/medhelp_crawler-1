    "question": "I have type 2 diabetes for about 2 1/2 years now and my medicines have been working until recently.About 2 weeks ago, my blood sugars have been higher than normal, between 200 and 400 all day. Normally they run about 70 to 200. There has not been any unusual stress, nor have I been ill, occassionaly I have eaten things I should not have or more than usual, but not excessivly. I did the same with the food around Thanksgiving and it did not affect the blood sugars like this, I had the occassional high, but not daily and all day like now.A couple of days ago I started to feel shakey, thirsty, urinating alot, nausea, headache, blurred vision, I called my Doctor and he said to go to the Emergency Room to have my urine checked. At the ER, they checked my blood sugar and it was 475, they gave me IV fluids and a shot of insulin which brought it down to 214 two hours later and down to 61 by the time I got home 6 hours later. At that time, I ate dinner and it went up to 89 after dinner, but before bed it was back up to over 200. What else can cause the sudden change in the readings being so high?I take my medicines everyday like I am supposed to. I am not on insulin.",
