            "answer": "I have been tested for hypoglycemia, and diabetes.. Everything coming back normal... I tend not to even bother complaining to doctors about things anymore, as they blame everything on being bipolar and anxiety... They don't care to do tests for what I need, and when I harass to the point they finally do the test... My results magically go missing... I am at the point of researching all of my own problems and doing what I can to minimize effects I have from illnesses from research and what I can do for myself...Have you complained to a doctor about your white outs?",

    "question": "I get white outs all the time... My vision will go blurry and then everything will go white.. i will be very light headed, and have fainted a few times when the white outs have come... Sometimes my breathing is affected, but not always... Some are more severe than others... some last 2 seconds, some last up to a minute... I am not sure what they are... sugar seems to help them... I tend to eat a lot of candy... I am always sure to have candy in the car because my fear is to have a white out while driving",
