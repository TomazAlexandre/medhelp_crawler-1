    "question": "I went in for my weekly checkup and my doctor read me my blood results for the sugar/diabetes test and said I failed horribly. It was supposed to be 135 but I was at 176 :( she says it could be diabetes but they want to do another blood test tomorrow just to make sure. I'm really nervous because she says it can cause still birth or a 9-10 pound baby with labor problems. I'm really scared I'm gunna fail again. Has any of this happened with you mommys? I'm a ftm and 31 weeks pregnant. And very nervous.",
