            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Yes, some of the symptoms could be due to mold allergy. There are various skin tests and a blood test called RAST which can detect mold allergy. You could also be having a systemic fungal infection.However there are other causes too like diabetes, hypothyroidism, polyarteritis nodosa that should also be looked into. Anemia and low blood sugar too can be a cause for your symptoms.Hope this helps. You must consult an allergy specialist and an internal medicine specialist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been suffering from several symptoms for over a year and they are progressively getting worse. I have a crack in my bathroom ceiling of my rented apartment and have cleaned mold off of that ceiling before. I have a feeling there is still mold growing inside of it. I have the following symptoms:~Chronic Sinus problem w/ a cough. Worse in the morning and at night (i.e. when i'm home)~Fatigue: I am constantly tired/have no energy.~Difficulty concentrating~Difficulty fighting infection (In the last year and a 1/2 i've had a bacterial infection in my mouth, viral infetion that caused bells palsy, gastroenteritis, and most recently a kidney infection)~lightheadedness/dizziness~Neausea-particularly in the morning (and unless I've been pregnant for almost a year, no its not morning sickness)~tingling/pain in my arm including joint pain in my wrist and elbow (no injury)~Extreme pain from my hip to my knee (my doctor thinks may be sciatica)I know I am senstive to mold in general as I have a skin allergy to outside mold (skin rash from mold on the leaves). This allergy has been getting progressively worse the last 3 autumns, and where as in the past I would not breakout unless there was direct contact, now simply breathing around it causes me to breakout in hives all over.My main questions is 1-am I right in thinking many/most of these symptoms could be from possible mold in my apartment and 2-is there a medical test to see if that is what I am suffering from (i.e. blood test)?Thanks",
