            "answer": "Thanks for the reply, Dr. Hagan. He did say that it wouldn't clear it up all together, but it should help somewhat. I've just got one more question if you don't mind. Why does my vision seem to be better some days (less ghosting) than others? Can this in anyway relate to astigmatism? Does it fluctuate as the day goes on? Thanks again!",

            "answer": "The curvature of the cornea varies in some people. Often is swells somewhat overnight as a result of less oxygen available due to closed eyelides. This changes the refractive error, as the eye clears the swelling the cornea reverts to its normal curvature.\u00a0\u00a0it can also be effected by cornea disease, systemic disease such as diabetes, contact lens, dry sports or pathology on the cornea.JCH MD",

    "question": "Hi, I recently posted about experiencing ghosting of bright objects against a dark background, (such as white text on a dark background or an orange bottle cap against a black coat) and seeing halos around street lights at night. I went to the doctors today, and the ophalomologist I saw said that I didn't have any sign of cataracts, glucoma, or any other type of disease in my eyes and that my eyes were almost perfectly healthy. I almost see 20/20 normally, its just lights that bother me in certain settings. He did say though that I have a slight astigmatism. Could this be what's truly causing the ghosting and halos? I have noticed lately that my vision seems to be better when I first wake up, but the symptoms (such as ghosting) get worse as the day goes on. Does astigmatism do this? Could it also be something to do with my blood sugar or tiredness? Anybody have any idea? Thanks in advance for any replies, this is driving me nuts!P.S. - The doctor did also prescribe me very weak glasses to try to help with some things. He said it'd make things a little sharper and it may either help the ghosting or make it worse all-together. I'm a little nervous now because I don't want to get glasses and never use em if they're going to just make the problems worse.",
