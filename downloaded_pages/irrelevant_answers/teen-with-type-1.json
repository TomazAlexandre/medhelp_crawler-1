            "answer": "Hi, I am also a 19 year old type 1 diabetic who could probably be descirbed as completely out of control as well. Although my reasons are probably different from that of your son, I can understand his situation, and I know for a fact that punishment will not solve the problem. The more you try to force your way with him (even though you have the best intentions) the more he will push in the wrong direction. I suggest your only choices are to either a) go into complete extremes and hospitalize him, or leave him entirely alone until he reacts on his own. Right now your son is stuck in a REALLY bad habbit that is extremely hard to break, atleast until something bad happens. In addition, when someone has extremely high blood sugars for a long period of time, it messes with the chemicals in their brain causing them to feel moody, depressed, or anxious at times, disabling them from thinking properly or caring about their own well being. Have you considered the idea of an eating disorder? It is becoming more common for teens to abuse their type 1 diabetes by omitting insulin shots, and purposely eating lots of high carb foods in order to lose weight or maintain a lower weight. Poor diabetes control also is behind sugar cravings and uncontrollable appetites which may be a factor in your son's addiction to junk food and pop. Poor blood sugar control is a vicious cycle that is extremely hard to break, not only physically, but psychologically and emotionally as well.",

            "answer": "My daughter is almost 21 and has been JD since she was 7. We have had a long struggle with a lot of tears over the years.She now is on the pump and it is wonderful. Our only problem is that like your son she does not take care of herself. There is only so much a parent can do when your child is an adult. She has been hospitalized 4 times in the last two years 3 times were in intensive care for \"non'compliance\" which led to DKA.Last month she almost died, her BS was 860 when she arrived at the hospital.She was at a college party and was drinking and took her pump off!We have always been very active through the years on checking up on tests etc.Now as an adult she just tells me \"yeah I took it\" and goes to work. At this point I don't know if it's a psychological problem or what. I just checked her tester today and it seems there is a 4 day lapse in testing.She tells me it's on another tester but I have been on this road\u00a0\u00a0before and tend not to believe her.We are all at our wits end here.If anyone else has a suggestion please let me know.You and I should keep in touch. Good Luck to your son and your family'",

    "question": "I have a 19 year old with type 1 who was diagnosed 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0He is now NOT taking care of himself, no blood glucose testing, not bolusing (on his pump), eating all the wrong foods.\u00a0\u00a0We tried taking his car away. but he has school and work to go to. We tried grounding him, but he sits around all day while we are at work. Now that he has a job with his own money and is mobile he lives on fast food, candy and regular pop that he can go out and buy on his own.\u00a0\u00a0We tried psychologists,diabetic educators, dieticians but he still will not take care of himself. He is currently on meds for depression.\u00a0\u00a0He is a good kid, staying out of the drug and alchohol scene. I cannot find any support groups in my area, they are 15 or more miles away.\u00a0\u00a0I am a shy person, so it is hard for me to start my own group.\u00a0\u00a0 I want to take him to a dialysis center to show him where he is headed, but our diabetic educator thinks that is not the solution. Are there any parents dealing with the same situation with a teenager?\u00a0\u00a0How are you dealing with it? What resources do you suggest? HELP!!!",
