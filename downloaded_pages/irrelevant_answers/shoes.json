            "answer": "Hi there. Proper foot care is essential particularly in minimizing formation of diabetic foot ulcers. You could choose from diabetic walking shoes to remain more active to prevent worsening your condition. Use an extra wide diabetic slippers for home use. These precautions are necessary for preventing stubbed toes and minor cuts at home, which can become foot ulcers. These diabetic shoes are different from regular ones and are individually fitted according to personal foot needs and size. Search for a health care equipment provider who deals with shoes for neuropathy. They would take your fittings and foot measurements. Usually fittings and measurements of every part of the foot need to be taken so that the diabetic shoes fit every contour of your foot. These are different with extra supports to protect sensitive feet. There is an insert sized according to your foot and these are water resistant. You can also check up with the insurance if they cover for home health care equipment. Hope this helps. Take care.",
