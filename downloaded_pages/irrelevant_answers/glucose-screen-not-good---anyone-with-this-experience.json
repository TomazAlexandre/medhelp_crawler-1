            "answer": "Hi I had a level of 154 for my first test so I had to do the 3hr test also.\u00a0\u00a0I went in around 9:00 for mine.\u00a0\u00a0They took blood then I had to drink the yucky cherry stuff--I hate anything cherry.\u00a0\u00a0Then at 1,2 and 3 hr they took more blood.\u00a0\u00a0I got my results like a day later and unfortunatley I failed that one also.\u00a0\u00a0My levels went to 170 during the second hr.\u00a0\u00a0Right now I just trying to watch my diet--if the levels get higher they may have to use medication.\u00a0\u00a0From what I understand this is\u00a0\u00a0more pregnancy related than anything, however they say your chances of getting diabetes when you get older does increase. I'm sure family history and diet play a part also.\u00a0\u00a0They also seemed to think my \"advanced maternal age\"(40) has some part to play too. Good Luck and try to relax.\u00a0\u00a0Also I'm so sorry to hear about the loss of your dog. Take Care",

            "answer": "isnt it annoying they wont let you go with only those few points over? GRR. The lab tech when i did the 3 hour said a lot of doctors will make you do the three hour test, any many women pass because of this.I did the three hour and passed :) It wasnt horrible. They said stop eating after 10PM the night before - i was snoring by then so not too bad!Also, the glucose drink fills you up somewhat that you dont get too hungry. Definetely bring something with you for after or drive directly to a nearby restaurant because by noon you will be hungry!Good luck - bring a book :)",
