            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I\u2019ll come straight to the point. Generally such wounds that do not heal are called no-healing ulcers in medical term. They could be non healing due to underlying infection, low supply of oxygen to the wound that is reducing the healing process, underlying diabetes, or due to underlying dermatitis. Wounds heal slower in smokers or alcoholics who have been drinking for a long time. So these have to be ruled out.Also diabetes leads peripheral neuropathy, atherosclerosis etc which make wound healing troublesome. You need a culture sensitivity of wound scraping to know what antibiotics will suit the infection. If there is underlying dermatitis, then this needs to be taken care of. If there is severe atherosclerosis preventing blood supply to wound, then this needs to be diagnosed by angiograms. Wound debridement would be required along with proper dressing at a wound clinic.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "The word debridement means they take a scalpel and cut out the infected material. This done under local anasethesia. This may not be necessary.What you have is a serious problem that required immediate medical attention. At the very least prescription antibiotics.In a worst case the wound will turn into gangrene, and you may lose your limb.So you need to put asside the late summer fishing trip and head for the nearest emergency room.",

    "question": "A few days ago I was itching my finger and some skin came off. It hurt at first but it wasn't bleeding so I just forgot about it. Then about 30 minutes later it starter to leak some kind of pus or something, not very thick though kind of like a pimple or something. So I just let it heal over a few days. It started to turn into a scab like thing the next day, then that night I accidentally itched it and the scab part fell off and I started bleeding a bit. I put a bandage over the wound and today I pulled it off to see how it was and it looked the same as last night when the scab fell off, and it kept bleeding. I wiped off the blood with bathroom tissue but after a few second the wound started bleeding again. Right now I have a band-aid on it in hopes that it will heal soon but I'm kind of scared that it wont cause I can still see a bit of skin on the cut but it bleeds like there's no skin. But it looks like there is a thin layer of skin. I posted this question here because I don't know if it will heal or how long it will take to heal.",
