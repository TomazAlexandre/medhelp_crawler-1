            "answer": "They give battery hens cyanide to produce more eggs. They give broiler chickens so many drugs, hormones and pesticides that it's hard to say if you are allergic to the chicken products or the toxins in them. Do you have drug allergies? Either way, if you develop allergies to milk/meat/ other animal products you will know the cause -- the drugs, steroids, stimulants and whatnot. I urge you to stop eating animal products. They are truly toxic. The new farming methods -- having more than 1 million chickens in a hen house at any given time -- creates conditions that just aren't safe for human consumption. Look at the recent salmonella egg outbreak for proof.You can get food allergy tests at a allergist/ENT (Ear Nose and Throat) doctor. I recommend it.",

I'm thinking it's the fat that is hard for me to eat now.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 60 so this is a very new thing for me.",
