    "question": "I have been taking lexapro 10mg for about 3weeks now. At first I was really tired and now I can't sleep at night but my anxiety has practically went away. I would like to know what other's experiences have been in taking this. Is it effective? Are you also on birth control? I think my anxiety is caused by taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo. Has anyone had a similar experience?",
