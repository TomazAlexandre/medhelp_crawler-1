            "answer": "If you are truly deficient in Vitamin B-12, you definently need to take some kind of supplement. It usually takes 6-7 years to become low on Vitamin B-12. Vitamin B-12 is stored in the liver & is usually only depleted if you have a problem absorbing it thru your digestive system. The doctors sometimes give Vitamin B- 12 shots ,short term, if you are worn down from surgery or possibly another sickness which causes excessive weakness or fatigue. It con boost your enery level. There is no adverse affects with taking Vitamin B-12 unless you have an allergy to it & that is very unlikely. You cannot take too much because it is water-soluable & any excess that your body does not use is excreted in your urine.Did they give you a iron replacement. If you were bleeding you ptobably became anemic & need iron to rebuild your blood.You can get both of these vitamins by taking a multi-vitamin with iron. Once you stop menastrating do not take iron unless the doctor tells you to because too much iron can cause you problems too.Good Luck & God Bless You, TJ",

    "question": "Hi, I am from NZ,am 51yrs.At about 48 started heavy bleeding and heamoraging. Menopause problems. I endured for 1 1/2 years, bleeding fully for 3 months and needing ambulance and blood transfusions (7 bags blood in all), and then with more bleeding the drs took out my womb. Bleeding stopped or I would of died, just from blood loss, but hadnt realized that almost all iron and vitb12 has depleted. Have to have injections of Vit B 12 from 8 months ago. Didnt do it as I believed that naturally I could make it. It hasnt happened, and from a person who never got sick before, then to a sick person, because of this depletetion. I am also overweight, being 17 1/2 stone,110 kilos, but no other problems, like blood pressure,diabetes ect. Now, cant shake flues, are dizzy and nervousiness. So after reading your forums, understand that it is a boost, and maybe some weight will come off. Are there any adverse side effects from these injections.? Keep well!",
