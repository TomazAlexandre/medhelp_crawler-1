    "question": "My aunt, who is 52 years old, always feels that there is a virtual hot strip in her back, continuing from the right shoulder to the waist, and then to the hip. She told me that the strip causes a rather painful high pressure on her back, which leads to great inconvenience to the movement of her legs. For example, it will be very difficult for her to stand up. She also feels that her abdomen is always tightly bound and her hand numb.These symptoms have become more and more severe ever since last autumn. She has tried many inspections in neurosurgery, orthopaedics, and incretion. Unfortunately there were no explicit results. She has been in hospital about four months ago and has tried physical therapy and knead for about two months. However, all these treatments have no positive effects. Any drugs make the situations much worse.She has been a hypertensive for about 10 years and a diabetic for about 5 years. For the time being her blood pressure and other figures are in normal ranges. CT shows that there are two little infarcts on her left thalamencephalon. MRI shows that her neck vertebra oppresses the vertebral nerve.Please help to relief her from the high pressure. Your assistance will be highly appreciated.My e-mail: ***@****, or ***@****",
