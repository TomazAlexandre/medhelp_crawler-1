            "answer": "Yes, LADA Type 1.5 is probably what he meant, but despite the name it is a lot more closely related to Type 1. Like Type 1, it is an autoimmune disease. The main difference is that it often comes on later in life and that it is a slower onset. People generally maintain on oral meds for anywhere from months to four years (unlike true Type 1's), although current thinking believes it's best to start insulin earlier to slow death of beta cells. There are people with LADA who develop insulin resistance, but in general this is not a feature of this Type (though the chief characteristic of type 2). Your doctor's comment indicates that like most doctors, he isn't terribly knowledgeable about LADA as it is not yet recognized by the ADA.",

            "answer": "Right on Sally! What bothers me in your post is \"I finally asked my doctor what type am I and he said I'm the blur in between type 1 and type 2?\". Why wasn't your doctor forthcoming by informing you of his/her diagnosis? A patient should never have to ask a doctor, \"Hey, what are, or is, the results of your diagnosis\"? It's quite obvious your current doctor has no clue nor interest in treating your current health state. Run from this doctor as fast as you can and find an Endocrinologist that knows how to treat type 1.5 aka LADA [Latent Autoimmune Disease in Adults].\u00a0\u00a0An Endo has specialized training with diabetes. Keep calling around until you feel satisfied with your Endo. Not all are up to date nor have the understanding of this disease.Follow these links for an understanding on LADA and 1.5. Google for more info.LADA - http://www.diabetesmonitor.com/lada.htmType 1.5 - http://tinyurl.com/type-1-5Ask your \"new\" doctor to test your pancreas insulin production. The test is called C-Peptide. http://diabetes.webmd.com/c-peptideWhile you're at it have your thyroid checked too. An irregular functioning thyroid will disrupt your pancreas insulin production. The test is called TSH [Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone].http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/thyroid-stimulating-hormone-tshDo you have a home glucose test meter? If not, you need one test your glucose levels and test often. This is one of the most important steps in controlling and managing diabetes. When you have your meter post back to this thread for an explanation on reference test times. The next important step is proper diabetes nutrition along with daily exercise.HTH",

I do test 3 to 4 times a day before each meal and exercise and even after I exercise. I live in a small town so not many doctors to choose from here that knows alot about LADA. Thanks for the info I'm still researching everything.",

This may force you to drive further than you want to see an Endo, but at least take the time to see one for a couple of visits.Here is a link to a LADA forum, several in your same shoes others with lots of knowledge.
