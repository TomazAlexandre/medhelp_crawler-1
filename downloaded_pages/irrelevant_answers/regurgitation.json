            "answer": "sounds to me like your stomache acid is out of kilter. Have you tried digestive enzymes to be taken before you eat. Most diseases stem from stomach issues. If\u00a0\u00a0your stomache acid is to low all the food in the world will not help you. You must work on getting your stomach acid by to the 7.2 range. Once there your body will be able to assimilate all of the proper nutrients from your food and get you back to good health.",
