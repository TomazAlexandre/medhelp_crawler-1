            "answer": "You know,LOL. first of all, I have no idea what spleen pain would be. BUT, if it is indeed my spleen, it's not like excruciating bad pain that I have to stay in bed. I would call it more of a \"soreness\" pain from my sternum, to upper left rib cage, to my lower left side.\u00a0\u00a0and then it wraps around to my upper left back like someone is \"knifing\" me..you know?\u00a0\u00a0Also, if I press my sternum, I can here it 'click'. lol. But now my ribs on my right and left are tad sore. a little, not SO much.\u00a0\u00a0but here's a bright spot. When I went to the STD clinic last week (at the 4 week mark) to get tested, the doc said that's no sign of an STD and said to talk to my general practitioner. I have been eating a lot since all this began and as a result have gained weight, so maybe my digestive system is reacting to the extra stress I've been puttin on it, not to mention my mental anxiety.And all this time I was thinking that my jaw has been tight and after feeling my lymph nodes in my neck that they are swollen, she (the STD doc) felt them and my groin nodes and said nothing swollen.\u00a0\u00a0I asked her, I have been trying to feel them and they feel swollen. She said to stop that cuz that will irritate your nodes.\u00a0\u00a0In my mind I said (woops! guess I was bein over anxious and paranoid!).but, all in all, I think I'm okay.I just got tested at 4 weeks, and will know by 22nd Nov, what the result is.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping negative, but logically speaking, it should be negative.I'll keep u updated. You do the same.-WorriedUS",

            "answer": "I was interested in this too, so I did some reading. Estimates vary widely, and much depends on where you are (Florida vs. Alaska, outside golfing vs. doing laundry in the basement) but generally it's said you have a 1 in 10,000 chance of being struck by lightning in your lifetime. Annually, it's about a 1 in 290,000 chance.Here's a more alarming statistic: you have a 1 in 7 chance of developing breast cancer in your lifetime, and a 1 in 3 chance of developing diabetes. But I bet most of the posters think nothing of eating a Big Mac and extra-large fries, smoking cigarettes, not exercising... What I'm wondering is, where are the boards for people afraid of diabetes? Cancer? Heart disease? All of those things are MUCH, MUCH more likely to kill you, even when you're young. What is it about HIV that's so frightening for people?So I have a theory. It involves childhood messages about sex, religion (ironically enough, the ones who are most freaked out seem to reference their enormous faith and thanks to god for \"pulling them through\"), guilt (over sex in general, \"risky\" partners, discomfort with sexual orientation, relationship status, whatever), and health anxiety in general. I'd love to know how many times people see their doctor per year. Oh, and I definitely suspect that these wild, unreasonable fears are a defense mechanism; they help keep folks from focusing on the very real and REALLY frightening issues in their daily lives.What do you guys think? Am I on track? What do you think drives you to worry so much about HIV and STDs in general? What do you think could help you relax a bit?",

            "answer": "I agree monkeyflower, totally but I have something to add..since there is a big flip side to this rather NEW disease.1)True, that in this country diabetes, heart disease and the like kill way more people than HIV.\u00a0\u00a0(500,000+ for Heart Disease ailments, 70,000+ for diabetes ailments and ONLY 15,000+ for HIV and AIDS-related complications).\u00a0\u00a0I got the figures from wrongdiagnosis.com and cdc.gov. (Verify anyone??)2) ALSO true, that given the chronic and irreversible nature of HIV and its AIDS-related complications, most people WILL understandably live longer, and have greater chances of living than say complications from diabetes or heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0It was once a death sentence, but now more a chronic disease, like you said in a post I read earlier. Most people can now expect to live an average of 24 years, according to Dr. Bruce Schackman, an assistant professor of public health at the Weill Medical College of Cornell University in New York. And that is just an average. But I would surmise it is probably much longer for many more newly infected people I think because of all the new pipelines of HIV medications from the pharm companies, new gene therapy for CD4 cells, and the availability of medication to those in a Western country. See link below.(http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/12/us/12hiv.html?ex=1164171600&en=5e4849829dd56222&ei=5040&partner=MOREOVERFEATURES3) But, and here is a BIG 'but', even though less people die from this disease than most other common American incurable epidemics, most people are going to have to undertake much more drastic (arbirtrary word here cuz I'm aware that diabetes, for e.g., does involve drastic nutritional and lifestyle changes but perhaps certain cancers do not) lifestyle changing attitudes and decisions based on their infections, i.e., marriage, relationsihps, health, and financials. Case in point--it costs on average more than $600,000 in a lifetime in health care costs for an HIV infected patient (same story, link above). Not to mention the social stigma STILL attached to having something like HIV as opposed to diabetes or a heart disease complication such as a heart attack. For example, the thought that it is a disease mostly acquired through promiscuity, it still possibly being ill-conceived as an overly contagious (as opposed to other higher risk but non-contagious epidemics like diabetes, cancer, heart disease, etc.), or perhaps in still some conservative circles, it being thought of as a 'gay' disease so to speak ---just generalizing here, not everyone believes it is a gay disease as such, I admit, however, it still has that \"raised\" eyebrow ponderance upon the faces of some when the mere mention AIDS or HIV is uttered, as if to say it is not appropriate dinner talk.Until HIV is understood more, more sex education is disseminated, more breakthrough research is done to counter the epidemic, more effective drugs become available,\u00a0\u00a0and perhaps most important, society in general has a much more benign attitude towards HIV via education, it will be a mortifier, at least mentally and thus continue to drive anxiety-driven posters like myself and others on this message board website to ask such questions about whether HIV transmission really deserves merit in low risk sexual encounters or even in a monogamous setting.Silver lining?\u00a0\u00a0From my simpleminded opinion, I can say, it seems that it is rather EXTREMELY difficult to get infected. I mean, just look at the probability of infection at 1/2000 for heterosexual encounters and 6/10,000 for insertive homosexual encounters! how about 1/10,000 for receptive fellatio!!(http://ww2.aegis.org/pubs/mmwr/2005/r402a1t1.gif).\u00a0\u00a0It takes a good amount of the virus to infect you i.e., from an epidemiologically standpoint. Doc H has said that different viral levels to infect a person will still result in a person having HIV and eventually full blow AIDS, if the transmission route is a successful one to the bloodstream. However, it seems that it takes an almost inordinate amount, read A LOT, of the virus for a greater probability of infection due to an abundance of factors, i.e., fragility of the virus to live outside of the body for more than a few seconds.Bottomline, even though it's impossible to get cured, it's almost virtually difficult to get infected from one or even several sexual encounters.\u00a0\u00a0And if you played it safe, you played it safe.\u00a0\u00a0But lack of understanding and education about a relatively new disease, among other things, is ample reason for the births of a lot Worry Worts, and understandably so!just my thoughts.-WorriedUS",

Thats how I read it anyway...And considering I drink a lot-and binge drink A LOT on the weekends-I think this would be a much more likely explanation! And 100 times more common than HIV!",
