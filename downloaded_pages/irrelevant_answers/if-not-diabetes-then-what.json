            "answer": "What happens if she doesn't get water when she's thirsty? Has she had any kind of head injury, even mild one? What about sunlight? Does that bother her at all?I don't think you are over worried. I think you need to take these symptoms seriously and get to the bottom of this. That may mean you have to go to several docs before you get the right dx.One thing that comes to mind is vasopressin. Sounds like something might be wrong with hers.Here's some info from the internet...Decreased vasopressin release or decreased renal sensitivity to vasopressin leads to diabetes insipidus, a condition featuring hypernatremia (increased blood sodium content), polyuria (excess urine production), and polydipsia (thirst).Diabetes isn't the only thing that can cause problems. If she hit her head, an injury could have \"broken\" the membrane or gland (I can't remember exactly how it works) in the brain that controls proper regulation.Also there is another disease but it's rare....cystinosis. Some of the symptoms you describe are consistent with that disease.Good luck and keep up posted.",

            "answer": "I reread your post. Since your daughter does complain about eye pain, I would seriously consider cystinosis. Take her to an eye doc that can look for crystals. That would be the easiest way to diagnose.",

            "answer": "May I ask if your little one has any developmental delays? Sometimes some illnesses can be tied in directly. Now I think it is time to get a new team of doctors. Funny Darlingdivatx mentions diabetes insipidus. I went to the nephrologist today, and that is one thing he is considering. There is something else called psychogenic polydypsia or something like that. I think she needs a full work up from a good pediatrician and if need be a pediatric kidney specialist. Getting a new doctor, you should research first and interview the doctor so you don't waste any precious time...then maybe you will get some help and some answers. Oh, does she have pica or anything? Does she seem fascinated by water? These are the only other two things I can think of asking. Sometimes vitamin deficiencies can cause things to be worse too. There are other rarer disorders dealing with the functioning of the kidneys which can cause other symptoms. Some include Bartter's syndrome and Gitelmans syndrome. So, in this world with neverending problems, the best you can do is your best right. You are a good parent and pat yourself on the bat. Peace to you and your family",

            "answer": "I to have been reseraching and I have found some of the same things and i new all these things a year ago, but i was told by the peds. office that i was worrying to much and that she will grow out of it. Well, she still holds her breath and turns blue when she startled by something or when she gets hurt,or mad. Then she curls her hands up and her feet,now she is starting to curl her body. Then she finally crys for a sec. then she passes out for about 15 sec. then she wants to sleep sometimes. When she was real little, i would notice that she would always hold her head back and she loved being up side down. she does love the water and this summer i would notice that she would want to hold her head back\u00a0\u00a0the water and just float. she trys to do that in the bath tub and gtes mad if theres not enough water to put her head back.she has been trying to eat paper,crayons,play dough and plastic but thats just how little ones are they always put things in there mouth. When i was preg. i thought i was drinking water but, my mom put m,grow in jug and i drank a big glass of it.\u00a0\u00a0At this point i just don't know. oh! Her father was just dx\u00a0\u00a0with sleep apnea. and she snores. Her eyes are starting to show a different color underneath but, i can only notice it.\u00a0\u00a0thanks to all",

            "answer": "Well if she starts this turning blue thing again I would take her in beforehand. Or if she seems really sick. If not, then whatever you feel comfortable with in my opinion is up to you. If you really want to take her in sooner, and it would help you feel better and if she needs to be seen I don't see why it would hurt. A lot of parents worry about their kids. And yes, some parents early on are over worried, but usually it is because they love their children and don't want them to be sick. On the other hand, I am sure many parents including patients have been brushed off on occasion or told it will be just fine and sometimes the squeaky wheel gets greased. I am not saying to get mad or anything lol, but if you feel that your little one needs help and is not getting it, then you have every right in my opinion as a human being to be a great big squeaky wheel.I hope you get the answers and help for your little one. Peace and blessings to you and your family. Oh and make a list :) if this is a new doctor of all the things that you feel are not typical or that your little one has done or dealt with since birth. It might be of help later on.",

    "question": "My 2 1/2 yr old. goes to the bathroom so much that sometimes we have to pull over on the side of the highway so she can go. She often tells us that her eyes hurt and that she does'nt feel good.\u00a0\u00a0she does drink alot and she is up in the middle of the night wanting to go to the bathroom. Once I recorded her going to the bathroom about 25 times in one day, it may be more. She bruies very easy and she has this sore on the coner of her mouth that has not healed in three weeks. she weighs about 27 pounds. we have had her blood checked and it was fasting 75. when she sleeps night or day she will move her lips like shes trying to get something to drink or like she has cotton mouth. I'm just probally worrying to much, any help would be wonderful. The doctors think I'm crazy.",
