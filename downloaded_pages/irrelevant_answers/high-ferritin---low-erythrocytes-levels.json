            "answer": "Hi!High ferritin with low erythrocytes can be due to hemolytic anemias such as sickle cell anemia and thalassemia. It can also be seen in sideroblastic anemia. The lab tests to identify these include hemoglobin electrophoresis, DNA analysis, osmotic fragility test, and glucose-6-phosphatase analysis. In sideroblastic anemia, abnormal RBC or red blood cells are formed due to inability to incorporate iron into the RBC.The other possibilities are infective liver disease, chronic inflammatory disease such as arthritis or asthma, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes. You need to discuss this with her treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
