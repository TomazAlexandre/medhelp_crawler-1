            "answer": "Difficult to say without evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0The burning sensation can be due to a neurological condition.\u00a0\u00a0A nerve conduction study can help exclude peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Various blood tests can also be done to evaluate for B12, diabetes, and thyroid disorders.I would check electrolytes as well - including the calcium, potassium and sodium levels.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.

    "question": "I\u00b4ve been experiencing some symptoms that have persisted now for 3 weeks and I\u00b4m not sure what these are and I\u00b4m not able to see a doctor for a while yet.Firstly I started to get some pains in my knees and around the back of my thighs and calves. This developed into some swelling in the back of my knees and a burning sensation around the inside and back my thigh. Eventually after about 3-4 days this burning sensation spread to the crotch area and around the front upper thigh. It was worse on the right side leg. I\u00b4m not really sure if the glands here were swollen, it didn\u00b4t really feel that different there.I also had a slight feeling under the arm pits and a thick fur covering on my tongue a lot of phlegm and a slight sore throat.It all seemed to be disappearing and getting better but then the other day I suddenly felt the burning sensation in my legs again and which subsided but then it all started under my arm pits and neck. I don\u00b4t have a sore throat but I do still have a lot of fur on my tongue but I have a pain running down the right side of my neck, my right side collar bone hurts a little and I\u00b4ve got the same burning under my arm pits and a little further down.Any idea as to what this could be as I\u00b4m starting to get concerned. About me, I\u00b4m a 34 year old slim male, I\u00b4m currently taking malarone as a prophylaxis.",
