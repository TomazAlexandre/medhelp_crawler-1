            "answer": "Hi, Usually a quadriceps tendon rupture occurs which is outside the knee joint so it is not considered as knee joint surgery. Quadriceps tendon rupture mainly occur in middle aged individuals during sporting activities. The most common mode of injury is landing from a jump as this leads to excessive loading on the quadriceps tendon causing it to tear.risk factors are diabetes, aging, previous steroid injection or degenerative changes in the muscle itself.",

            "answer": "Hi,Ruptures of the quadriceps tendon occur relatively infrequently and usually occur in patients older than 40 years. In rare cases, partial ruptures of the quadriceps tendon are seen in young athletes with end-stage jumper's knee. Quadriceps tendon rupture usually occurs during a rapid eccentric contraction of the quadriceps muscle with the foot planted and the knee partially flexed. This injury commonly occurs during falls. Other mechanisms of injury include direct blows, lacerations, and iatrogenic causes. Early surgical repair yields the best results for complete quadriceps tendon ruptures. Unless unfit for anaesthesia , there are no contraidications for the surgery.",
