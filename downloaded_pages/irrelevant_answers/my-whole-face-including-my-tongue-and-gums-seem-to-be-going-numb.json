            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.The first thing I would have done is imaged your brain, and I am glad that your MRI was normal.Unexplained numbness can be seen in a condition called small fiber neuropathy. This basically is inflammation or damage to the very small nerve fibers which supply our skin. Characteristically it can present with burning, tingling, numbness and pain in the hands or feet, or anywhere in the body. It can be intermittent or constant. Sometime people have other symptoms like low blood pressure, palpitations, urinary problems, nausea, diarrhea or other gastrointestinal complaints.Usually we test for a cause with multiple blood tests, to rule out infectious, inflammatory, metabolic or autoimmune causes ( e.g Vitamin B12 deficiency, low thyroid function, diabetes, abnormal protein in blood, sarcoidosis to name a few). The final diagnosis is usually with a skin biopsy. This is a very simple outpatient procedure where they take a small punch biopsy from the affected area. But more often then not, no cause is found, and it is treated symptomatically.You should see a neurologist for a full work up and neurological exam. It could be a very simple thing like a vitamin deficiency or thyroid problem which could be treated with relief of symptoms.I hope this helps. Good luck!",

    "question": "I've had an MRI and CT scan. Nothing shows up. For the last couple of years my face is slowly going numb. Not on just one side but the whole face. There is no pain and no loss of muscle control. It is driving me crazy but the doc can't figure it out. Was told to get some blood test done but can't afford it right now. What could cause this? Thanks",
