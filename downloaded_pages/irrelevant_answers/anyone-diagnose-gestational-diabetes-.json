I'm the mornings avoid fruit and juices. Keep milk low in the mornings as well. Try to do high protein as it will keep you full. Avoid carbs, they turn into sugar and will spike your blood glucose levels. Snack between meals, veggies and cheese are perfect because they have low carb or no carbs. Good luck, and follow the diet you are told by your doctor/dietician and you and your little one will be just fine.",
