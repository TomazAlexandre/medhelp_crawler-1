            "answer": "by DOOZHI; hi thanks for commenting. no she does not have major insurance coverage but does have something called ACCSS. it is coverage but not the best. she did however visit a chiropractor the other day. she was told she is in bad shape. so, she was treated (out of pocket) and will receive several more treats with chiropractor. she was also told by the physician there that some of her symptom could very well be fixed with more treatments. the doc there will accept her insurance from here on out. yeah im just suggesting anything i can for my mother and she's been cooperative as well. because she wants to get better too.",

            "answer": "Hi, I am concerned re your mother's dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0Did she have a cardiac workup? That would include cardiac enzymes, EKG, monitoring if she might have an arrythmia (irregular heart beat) that intermittently prevents proper blood flow to her brain.\u00a0\u00a0I am also concerned about her carotid arteries-was a doppler study done to check blood flow to her brain via these arteries.\u00a0\u00a0It is non-invasive and painless.Your mother may have diabetic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Even with good control of diabetes, this can occur.\u00a0\u00a0This might explain the weakness in her legs.\u00a0\u00a0She may have decreased sensation that has occured over a period of time and may not be aware it is there.I have concerns re her having chiropractic work. Manipulation of her neck area may not be proper at this time . Waiting to see how her carotid arteries are may be wise.\u00a0\u00a0Also, is her arthritis bothered by the manipulation?If possible, get her to a teaching hospital.\u00a0\u00a0There is better access to experts in the field of diabetes, cardiology, and arthritis.If she goes to the ER, legally, ethically, morally, she must be seen. If you can get a referral for admission without going through the ER, that will speed things up.\u00a0\u00a0Either way, she has to be seen.Please take care of yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Your mother is fortunate to have you.",

    "question": "Hi. Im posting on behalf of my mother. We live on a reservation where medical is not very good. My mom has recently been experiencing weakness in her lower body from her waist on down. Especially in her thighs and knees. She had a few falls already since the last year; about 14 falls. Im so upset with the hospital in our town. They seem indifferent to her and haven't even tried to diagnose her. She is 70 years old and native american. She is diabetic but has that under control; to our her knowledge. She has mild arthritis in her fingers and knees. She has not experienced any trauma to her body in the last 2 years; accidents, etc...other than her falls related to the weakness. She also experiences dizzy spells on occasion. If there is anyone who might have opinions, ideas, and want to share, please do. Thanks you so much.",
