So listen to the doc on no sex and rest as much as possible. You want baby to bake as long as possible even with that shot to minimize complications. Good luck!",

    "question": "Im 31 weeks and 3 days and today I was told i was having mild preturm labor. They didnt give me anything to stop the contractions. Just a shot for the babies lungs. Told me not to work out anymore, and to take it easy but compelety on bed rest..just dont over do it.My question is if anyone has had this happen and make it to at least 36 weeks or above.My other question is they told us not to have intercorse. Does that mean for me not to orgasm or just to avoid the intercorse.I know thats the least of my worries but this pregnancy has made me extra horny so i just wanted to know.",
