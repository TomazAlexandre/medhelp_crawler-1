    "question": "i'm 22, and i don't know what's wrong with me. I have been having anxiety, i guess for awhile now, but it's gotten out of control. it started when i was 12, when i would have to \"knock on wood\" or whatever surface was available whenever i thought a bad thought or when someone else would say something bad that might happen. now, i feel like im in a horror movie most days. nothing seems real, nothing brings me joy, and i feel so awkard around people. and when guys check me out in the street or guys look at me i get this awful feeling in my stomach. everyone tells me i'm beautiful and funny, and great, but all i see most of the time when i look in the mirror is a monster. i feel like everything i do from the way i walk, to everything i say to people is fake and i'm just acting. i feel like i have a constant camera on me, and everyone knows i'm being fake. i feel like this half of the time, and then sometimes, i feel like myself,and i say the right things, and that i can do anything, and everyone loves me. at all times i crave male attention/any attention and i although it makes me nervous when guys check me out, i feel like i need it. i have been obssessing that i'm a ********* for four years now. the thought popped in my head one day four years ago, and it's developed into a sickness. what if i am a horrible, sick person? i think that im possessed by a demon, have diabetes, brain tumor. i try and tell myself that i can control my thoughts, but i can't! i can't stop obsessing. i'm miserable. when i'm like this i think of suicide and everyone scares me. im scared to be alone. i scared to tell anyone these thoughts because i'm afraid people will shun me, or think i'm a freak. please help! i can't live like this!",
