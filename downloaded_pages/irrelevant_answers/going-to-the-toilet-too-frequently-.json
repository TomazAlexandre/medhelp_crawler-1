            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well, it could be that your body does not need that much of water. Try making it 7-8 average size glasses and see.Your symptoms could be due to UTI, or urinary tract infection. The infection could be at any level from bladder to ureter to kidney. It could also be due to a stone in the urinary tract. You need to get your urine examined for infection.However increased frequency of urine is also seen in diabetis mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Small for size bladder and overactive bladder too produce increased frequency.You must talk to your physician regarding all these possibilities. You would need some more tests beside urine analysis to reach a confirmed diagnosis. I would strongly recommend you to consult an urologist. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I go to the toilet to urinate very frequently - atleast every 10 - 15 minutes. Also wake up twice in middle of the night.I feel like I'm not releasing the entire urine when I'm on the toilet and feel that I still need to release more. I am constantly feeling bloated.I try and drink +/- 2 litres of water per day - do you think this is causing me to do the frequent loo visits?Look forward to hearing from you.Jo",
