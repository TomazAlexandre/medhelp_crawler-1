            "answer": "You're welcome. And that is good news about Galvus. I'm glad to hear its working out for you with no side effects. The liver enzyme panel tests that checks for inflamation are ALT [Alanine Transaminase] and AST [Aspartate aminotransferase]. When the liver is ill it gets inflamed. I get both every other month.",

    "question": "Hi,Im still pretty new to Diabetes though I have posted before about my medications. My doctor has told me that my fasting blood test was 10, is this very high ? I do not test my own blood but am sent to the hospital for fairly regular tests but notice that when people post with their\u00a0\u00a0blood glucose levels they are in the 100s. I am from the UK and wonder if there is a conversion chart because I think it would be more beneficial if I could compare with others on the forum to get a sense of how im doing for comparison,Any advise would be greatly appreciated .ThanksAngie",
