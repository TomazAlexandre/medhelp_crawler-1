            "answer": "I gained way more than you at that point and kept bringing it up to drs because i ate normal like pre-pregnancy and still do and never overate, never had cravings and worked out since day 1 and they never seemed to take an interest in my weight concern at 2 different dr offices (i moved mid pregnancy). I am 38 weeks and dont have gest. diabetes, but baby is measuring big and i am retaining a lot of water apparently so i guess that's part of it. I kind of wish my drs took a little more interest in why i gained so much with all i do workoutwise and not pigging out and such. I am 5'2\".",

My doctor always says as long as you're eating in moderation, eating healthy and walking (or doing some sort of exercise every day) you're fine, every body is different!!!",

I try to eat healthy with occasional cravings but the weight just sticks to me. So sometimes I feel during pregnancy is inevitable to not gain weight.",

My dr doesn't care about weight but hospital said I shouldn't put on more then 10kgs or about 20lbs this pregnancy as my prepregnancy weight was 90kgs (anout 198lbs). However I was the same prepregnancy weight last pregnancy and putnon 17kgs or about 37lbs and lost it all without any trouble.",

            "answer": "I'm 34wks and I've only gained 15lbs so far...my doc said I needed to gain more weight...like a pound a week to be at 21lbs the entire pregnancy. I'm 5'4 and 139lbs prepregnancy so I was below the ideal according to them. At around 31wks I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes so now I'm on a 2100 calorie diabetic diet which I hate...since I'm pretty active (normal) so I'm always starving! My blood sugar levels have been good but I'm subjected to scans every single week and non stress tests until I deliver which is so inconvenient :( So in a nutshell...I'm sorry she made u feel bad that's terrible but while fast weight gain may be a sign of gestational diabetes it's not a guarantee it will happen to u, since I was the opposite with weight gain and I have GD! I had no indications before the standard test... My advice is to just stay as active as u can and eat as clean as u can and as long as u and baby are ok, alls well :) Good luck momma!",

    "question": "So I'm 25 weeks and went to the Dr today. The place I go rotates between drs,midwives and nps. So I met this one Dr for the first time today. She seemed a bit harsh. I asked her about weight gain. I was 154 before I got pregnant and I'm 5'4\". I had a little extra but didnt think I was too bad. Today I weighed in at 173 and was told by the Dr I need to slow down. She said you have already gained too much. Really? I was just curious how much weight everyone else has gained at 25 weeks. She made me feel ****** and told me I'm going to get gestational diabetes.",
