            "answer": "What you need is more in depth testing, such as a 2 hour oral glucose tolerance test, hemoglobin A1C, and possibly insulin levels.It is also important to know what your fasting blood sugar is.Look into it, Nalla.\u00a0\u00a0My husbands numbers post eating weren't much different than yours, and when he had more testing done, he was blatantly diabetic and is on medication.",

            "answer": "My Dr. wants me to come back in and get more testing done in a few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0He wanted to wait untill everything calmed down after my gallbladder was taken out.(2 weeks ago)\u00a0\u00a0A few weeks ago I had two fasting blood tests done and the first one was 123 and the other was 125.\u00a0\u00a0So he has diagnosed me with pre-diabetes because of those numbers.\u00a0\u00a0He said when I come back I need to be fasting for at least 8 hours and I will be drinking this sugar drink similar to when I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I'm assuming that is the 2 hour glucose test.He also wanted me to start reading and learning as much as I can about diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have been trying, but there is so much confusing info and it seems like every site I go to says something a little different.\u00a0\u00a0And the people I have been talking with make it even more confusing!And another confusing thing is, is if I don't eat something for at least 3 hours my blood sugar drops to below 70. It ranges between 60-70.\u00a0\u00a0And I end up feeling really sick.\u00a0\u00a0And I didn't know you can have a problem with high AND low blood sugars.And I hear from people that pre-diabetes is serious and needs attention (not meds) and others say it doesn't mean anything and is no big deal.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if I should be worried or not.\u00a0\u00a0And I don't know yet how to change my diet.\u00a0\u00a0Some people say to take sweets out of your diet, but others say you need the sweets to mantain the sugars, others say to take out carbs, some say to take out all carbs, others say take out bad carbs.\u00a0\u00a0AAHHH\u00a0\u00a0it's so confusing. lol",

            "answer": "You can be having a problem with insulin regulation in your body.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad to hear you are having furthur testing done.My husbands fastings were just about what yours were, btw.\u00a0\u00a0His 2 hour GTT was abnormal, as was the hemoglobin A1C test.\u00a0\u00a0So this confirmed the diagnosis of diabetes, even though his blood sugars weren't all that whacked out.His doctor really didn't give him any teaching other than to tell him \"Take this pill twice a day and come back in 3 months\".\u00a0\u00a0I had to do my own research and come up with a diet plan, which he rarely follows...grrr!Despite his not following any sort of a healthy eating plan, his retesting in 3 months was normal.\u00a0\u00a0His fasting bloods sugars are now normal, too.I did buy a home glucose monitor to test him occasionally, but I practically have to knock him unconscious to do it, so I gave up on it.Since you are having more problems with lows and highs, you might want to invest in a home monitor (they run about $30-$70), some finger prickers, and testing strips.\u00a0\u00a0Your pharmacist can help you decide what model might be right for you, and what you need to buy to go along with it.\u00a0\u00a0The finger pokers and the testing strips can get expensive, though.Good luck!",

So I have been doing that for about a week now.That sucks about your husband.\u00a0\u00a0My husband doesn't have diabetes, but I know how frusterating it gets when he won't take care of himself. He has other medical issues, not as serious as diabetes though.\u00a0\u00a0 Diabetes is scary, so I'm glad to hear his tests have been coming out good!I will definatly look into the South Beach diet!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!Do you know if pre-diabetes is serious?\u00a0\u00a0I don't really know how to look at it.\u00a0\u00a0Is there damage being done now or does this just mean that someday I will get diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Because I have not been feeling right for a few months.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse that told me you don't get symptoms untill they are in the 700 range told me that a person with pre-diabetes doesn't get symptoms at all.\u00a0\u00a0And there must be something else wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0So I just don't know.\u00a0\u00a0I will be relieved when I see my Dr. and finally know what is going on with my body!Thanks again!",

You can prevent it with a good diet and....the dreaded word.....exercise.It is very important, as diabetes affects your nerves, eyes, kidneys, etc. Good luck. Also, have your dr refer you to a dietitician at your local hospital. Your heath insurance, if you have it, should pay for it,. The biggest problem.......then you have to follow the plan.....I can't stress how important it is. I know, because I didn't do it, and I regret it. Now I'm fighting diabets, degenerative osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia. Good luck. Please post yur test results..........And I think the nurse's advice is baloney. I've never been 700, and I've felt ill lots of times.",

(My Dr. said that I have pre-diabetes)\u00a0\u00a0A few hours after eating my ranges are from 140-150.\u00a0\u00a0I have heard that anything over 100 is bad, but another place said that anything over 200 in the middle of the day is bad. Which is it?Whenever mine gets up to 140 or higer is when I start to feel bad, but a nurse told me that you don't feel bad untill it gets up into the 700's.Does anybody have any idea's?",
