            "answer": "I had GD with my last two children. The one that's 10 now was pretty tough because back then, if you couldn't get your diet under control..\u00a0\u00a0you gave yourself multiple insulin shots a day. It was a very hard pregnancy.My last baby who's a year was a GD baby. I was able to go on medication and it made it much easier. I get GD pretty badly towards the end, and even if I starve my blood sugar is high.Artificial Sweetner isn't really that great for anyone, but it's better than succumbing to that bowl of icecream. On the other hand, if you're taking pills to manage your sugars, then ear the cookie once in a while. The baby will be okay.. just make sure it's once in a while..!!If you eat too much sugar, I know you've heard your baby can get too big..\u00a0\u00a0but there's something else that can and usually does happen that you don't hear much about. Your baby can, and there's a good chance they will, have low blood sugar when they are born. If you eat a lot of sugar, your baby is used to producing a lot of insulin to deal with how much sugar they're getting and when they get out, that sugar fix is gone, but the insulin is still in high gear in their system. This will mandate an additional 24hrs at the hospital. They will supplement your baby with formula to deal with the blood sugar. If you plan on nursing, keep this in mind!! Also, you do have the right to give your baby the formula rather than the nurse. Please remember, this is your baby! You can attach a tube to your breast or finger and try to make it as natural of a process as possible if you do plan to nurse. You don't have to use the nipple.Just an FYI..Good luck!",
