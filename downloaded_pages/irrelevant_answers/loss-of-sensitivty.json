            "answer": "Hello,Parasthesia is one possibility which can present with such symptoms. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hi, i was drinking beer throughout the day on friday and fell asleep somewhat drunk. When i woke up in the morning i had to pee, but i noticed my penis felt somewhat less sensitive. Its not numb but just less sensitie, especially when it come to sexual sensitivty. I am experiencing some pins and needles on my forearms,feet, and legs. I have ocd and hypochondria, and i already assumed that i have permanent damage to these areas. I hope not, i was hoping this a temporary side effect. Could you give me your opinion on what this could and could'nt be?",
