            "answer": "Unless the knee pain is severe, it should not prevent you from standing up from a crouched position. Limb girdle muscular dystrophies can be passed on through genetics. What I would recommend doing is contacting your primary care doctor who can evaluate you, and obtain blood for muscle enzymes. If these are positive, then he/she can refer you to a neurologist, preferablly one who specializes in neuromuscular disorders. Good luck.",
