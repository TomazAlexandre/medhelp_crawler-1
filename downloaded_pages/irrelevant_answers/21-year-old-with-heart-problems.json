            "answer": "I think you definitely should go in and get your heart checked, a lipid panel as well and see if you need to start taking BP medicine.\u00a0\u00a0The mountain dew not only has sugar, it has caffeine which constricts your blood vessels and can raise your blood pressure & increase your pulse rate.\u00a0\u00a0 I got the shakes once after taking my second prescribed cafergot pill for migraine (ergotamine with caffeine medicine).\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, a young age is no guarantee you can't have a heart problem.\u00a0\u00a0Please go to the doctor ASAP!",

    "question": "I was at Robin Hood today with my family and began to feel quite ill. It was right after my second Mt.Dew & popcorn so I thought it may be from a sugar rush. However, as I sat longer my feet began to shake, my breathing became more difficult and I got severe nausea. So I rushed to the bathroom for twenty minutes. I recently got my blood pressure checked and it was 151 over 97 with a 141 pulse. I also weigh 240 pounds & stand 5'10. I'm not quite sure what the problem is other than it began last night after I mowed the lawn for the first time this year. Since I'm only 21 yrs. old is this cause for great concern? Thanks!",
