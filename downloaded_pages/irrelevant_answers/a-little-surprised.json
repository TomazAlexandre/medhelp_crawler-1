            "answer": "Get into a diabetes education program to learn about food portion control and timing between meals.\u00a0\u00a0(Many hospitals and HMO's have free classes.)\u00a0\u00a0I eat small amounts every 2 to 3 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I don't feel hungry and I don't deny myself any foods; I just eat smaller portions and try to keep active.\u00a0\u00a0Some years ago I read that diabetics do produce insulin but sometimes it's too much for the body to absorb and so it doesn't get used.\u00a0\u00a0Eating small meals throughout the day allows the pancreas to produce insulin in small doses that the body can use.\u00a0\u00a0At least, this was the thinking back in the day.My husband is Ethiopian, is slightly built and has a very active job.\u00a0\u00a0His lab tests began to show an increase in his blood sugar so I asked the doctor to stop the two blood pressure meds he was taking.\u00a0\u00a0His blood sugar numbers dropped dramatically!I believe 120 is the magic cutoff point that signals you're becoming diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Your numbers are still low enough not to be considered pre-diabetic but it's wise to monitor yourself just the same.",

            "answer": "rosco888, thank you for your reply indeed.\u00a0\u00a0Another doctor advised me along the same lines as you did.\u00a0\u00a0She said to keep a diary of my diet and bring it to their dietician.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, the official number is 106 mg/dl not 107.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me, that makes me feel all the more better.The difficulty with keeping some sort of diet diary would be that I eat mostly traditional foods and with that it is somewhat difficult to keep track of the quantities of each ingredient and all the spices and curries are mostly unlabled. Honestly, I don't even know the names of most of the foods we prepare but I know for sure that the amount of sugars and fats is so low to even quantify or measure. It is perhaps what I am not eating rather than what I am eating that could be a problem. I will try to write down my food intake for a few weeks and see if there are any loopholes. This year I have been eating healthy almost religiously and my cholestrol dropped by 24 points although it was not high in the first place. In fact, if I were to guess, my BG was probably higher than 106 a year ago.Unfortunately, I am predisposed to every serious disease out there including high blood pressure, diabetes, alcoholism, depression etc. That is the family history I come from. In fact, none of my parents saw their sixtieth birthday and not most of their relatives either but that is in Eritrea.That is why I am starting to become overly concious and trying to take control sooner rather than later. My mom was suffering from hep C for over 20 years and we did not know until several months before it turned into cancer of the liver. That really made me hate surprises. I apologize for this lengthy rant but I would rather express my concerns to a group of knowledgeable people in this forum than keep it in and stress about it.Thank you so much",

            "answer": "My husband is also from Eritrea!\u00a0\u00a0His cousin in New York is battling gout and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But when they traveled home a few years ago, the cousin ate anything he wanted and suffered no ill effects.\u00a0\u00a0Someone suggested that it is the American diet that's causing the problem.\u00a0\u00a0However, my theory is that it is the side effects of the medications we're all taking for high blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.If you're taking medications, look them up on the Web and see if any have side effects that increase blood sugar and discuss this with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0My theory is, if meds can affect the heart, liver and kidneys, why not the pancreas as well?When your doctor asked you to keep a diary of your food intake, she was perhaps looking for an indication of how much carbohydrates you take in in the course of a day.\u00a0\u00a0These foods convert to sugar inside the body and are stored for use during physical activities.\u00a0\u00a0Fruits are also suspect as they contain a lot of sugar in the form of fructose.Keep in mind that the readings one gets depend on when one last ate.\u00a0\u00a0Tests should be done two hours after eating rather than when the stomach is full and still digesting.\u00a0\u00a0It makes a difference.\u00a0\u00a0At 106 or 107, you're still below the worry stage.In your original post you start off by saying you are a 34 year-old African man and later you say you are 57.\u00a0\u00a0Please tell me you're not having a bit of fun at our expense.",
