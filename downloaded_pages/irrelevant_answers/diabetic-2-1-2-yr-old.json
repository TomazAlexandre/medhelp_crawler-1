            "answer": "My son was diagnosed at 16 months. He was drinking too much, and would wet through up to his armpits within a few hours of sleep. What REALLY tipped me off was the \"acetone breath\" It's a sign of ketoacidosis. Hopefully it hasn't gotten to that point, but my son was only diabetic for roughly a month before I noticed it. His breath, to me, smelled like nail polish remover...a kind of \"fruity\" smell. When I took him in to the dr's office his blood sugar was 550. No one told me to not feed him before they tested him so he had pasta, juice and a banana for lunch about half an hour before the test!! My suggestion is, smell her breath. First thing in the morning. If it smels a little \"fruity\" have her tested. Better safe than sorry.",

    "question": "My 2 1/2 year old is not a big eater, but she drinks constantly and will wet through a pull up within a matter of minutes.\u00a0\u00a0She has always been tiny so she isn't losing weight that I am aware of and doesn't seem to have any other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0My husband is a type I diabetic so I am a little concerned.\u00a0\u00a0We did randomly check her blood sugar and it was around 120 and didn't seem too bad.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a need to have the pediatrician check her out?",
