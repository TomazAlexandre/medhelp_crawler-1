Just tingly throughout the body and extreme dizzyness.Doctor got a Ct scan for the head and ultrascan on the liver.Im waiting for those tests to come back. any thoughts on what it possibly is?thanks",

            "answer": "Hello,The normal ranges for AST and ALT are around 0 to 40 IU/L and 0 to 45 IU/L respectively.If your enzymes are in 150\u2019s,so definitely they are a lot elevated.Elevated liver enzymes are found in hepatitis,fatty liver,alcoholic liver disease,obesity,diabetes(uncontrolled),infectious mononucleosis,autoimmune hepatitis,metabolic liver disease,gallstones,tumors of liver,pancreas and bile ducts and side effects of medicines like certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), cholesterol medications, antibiotics or anti-seizure medications.The approach of the doctors is right in getting an ultrasound liver and CT head so as to rule out the hepatic and neurological causes of raised liver enzymes and correlating the investigations with your symptoms of fatigue and dizziness.Confirmatory diagnosis can be made only after these investigations.Hope it helps .Take care and pls do keep us posted about the test reports and in case you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "i am a 18 year old male that is physically active. The past two weeks i have been experiencing rather worrysome symptoms. This has happend to me four times the past two weeks. During minimal sports activity i feel a rush of dizzyness, lightheaded, fainting, numbness in toes, confusion, really really sore legs-almost like dead weight, and pain in stomach,irritibility, more thirsty. While this happend to me i took a break for 10 minutes and found that gatorade made me close to 100% better.so i thought my symptoms might have to do with pre-diabetes? but when i took my blood glucose chart it wasnt out of the ordinary.Note: When my symptoms occur it isnt because im not used to pushing my body. infact i generally excersize close to 10 times harder and longer. it also isnt nerves because i have been put into this situation for the past four years and never had a problem.My grandpa has diabetes but thats it for family members. My mom and her sisters have hypothroidism but i heard it is rare for men to develop it. Any thoughts and thanks in advance",
