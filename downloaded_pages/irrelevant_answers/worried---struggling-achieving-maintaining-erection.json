            "answer": "Your inability to achieve or maintain an erection may be multi factorial. However, an over-riding factor is probably performance anxiety -- you are watching yourself I think. This can spill over to self-pleasuring.Get fit, quit smoking and take intercourse off the menu for a while. Don't bother going to a neurologist. Check for diabetes. One way or another you WILL get over this. All erectile dysfunction is manageable. Testosterone therapy may have a function for you, I could go on and on.",

            "answer": "a) You're not \"far from it\", you are obese (your BMI's 36.9, merely overweight is 25-29.9).\u00a0\u00a0E.D.'s not uncommon at all amongst the obese.\u00a0\u00a0 Sadly, >2/3rds of North Americans are overweight or obese.If you do not drop your weight quite a bit, you are at High Risk of getting diabetes, a Major disease.Obese people are at much heightened risk of stroke/death from heart/cardiovascular disease (so an E.D. drug might be Dangerous for you to use).b) I completely agree that dropping smoking would not only be terrific for your overall health (and that of anyone working/living with you), but likely for your E.D., too (since nicotine constricts blood vessels, the opposite of what you need during an erection, so smoking's certainly Not helping matters)c) performance anxiety could be a large piece of the answerd) prescription meds are serious business, if you needed to get your blood levels tested, then you needed to do so.\u00a0\u00a0this neglect should be corrected on its own merit without delay",

    "question": "Hello all, thanks for taking time out of your lives to help me. I'll try to cut directly to the point, and only include information I believe is relevant. Let's begin:I'm 27 years old, approximately 5'9\" in height, and about 250lbs. I am overweight, but very far from obese, and I've never had this type of issue before. I seldom drink alcohol, began smoking a few years ago, have had hemorrhoids/still have slight swollen tissue, and I have epilepsy (I'm on valporic acid).Basically, I've always had an extremely high sex drive (masturbating 5-10 times/day for as long as I can remember), but I've noticed within the last 1-2 years that it's becoming increasingly difficult for me to achieve an erection, and/or maintain it. I haven't been able to masturbate due to not being able to achieve an erection.I met a new girl a few weeks ago, and I'm head over heels for her. Upon having sex, or better yet attempting to, have sex for the first time, I wasn't able to maintain my erection. I was erect during oral, though sometimes I lose it during the receiving end, but when it came to actual penetration, I lost it. At first I thought it was nerves, but that same night I attempted to masturbate, and I haven't been able to get going, so to speak.I feel like my normal self, really. Despite being overweight, I have never experienced anything like this. I did stop exercising for quite a long time, but ever since this incident, I have picked up a workout regimen. As I said, I otherwise feel normal. I have noticed a very SLIGHT change in my sex drive, but nothing extreme. It seems I'm mainly struggling with the erection aspect. I guess I ultimately have the following questions:1. Is there a chance the medicine I'm taking for Epilepsy (Valporic Acid) is somehow affecting my sex drive/inability to achieve/maintain an erection? I was supposed to get my blood levels checked, but admittedly I never did. I've done a small amount of research, and according to what I understand, this is possible, but my knowledge here is quite limited.2. I've only smoked (cigarettes) for ~3 years or so. Is there that big of a risk in terms of sexual performance? I've read a lot of information regarding this, and it seems doctors tell you to quit smoking \"just in case.\" I don't care if I have to quit, I'm just trying to understand if it's that big of a deal.3. Is there a chance hemorrhoids have caused some type of damage somehow?4. My biggest concern is really just ensuring I haven't somehow caused any type of permanent damage. Is there anything I should be specifically concerned about (in terms of physical damage), based off the information I've shared? I'm only 26 - going on 27 - and I'd really prefer to not have to take Viagra, and/or not have a functioning\u00a0\u00a0penis.5. Last but not least, is there any specific place I should begin? Am I just going to my regular doctor, or should I actually follow-up with my neurologist to have my blood levels checked? I imagine if I get my levels checked, and perhaps talk to him about my issue, maybe he'd be able to shed some light.Anyway, I appreciate any advice/insight/etc. and I apologize for ranting a bit.Have a great day!",
