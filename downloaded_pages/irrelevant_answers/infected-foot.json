            "answer": "Personally, I feel this decision is way too important to look for guidance from people on an online website. You seem to be raising good questions about the decision to treat or amputate and I would ask for a second opinion from a qualified specialist. Ask for your questions to be explained in clear language so that you are comfortable with the reasoning behind the decision.",

            "answer": "There are several options that should be considered before amputation. And they should be considered as of yesterday.Hyperbaric oxygen (in a chamber) is available at few hospitals, but has been used as a treatment to prevent amputation. Try this route immediately. Nicotine patches are also being experimentally used.That being said, for them to suggest amputation there is a life-threatening problem. If the infection proceeds there may be no\u00a0\u00a0choice but to amputate the leg.",

    "question": "My mom has diabetes it is being control it is 89.\u00a0\u00a0She has an infected foot. The surgeons are sayin they want to amputate the foot. But I dont want them to do that. She has feelin in the foot. They did an artiary test and there is no blockage in the foot blood is flowing through the foot. So i am asking them if they can jus remove the infection out of the foot. They have not yet done any cuttin to the foot. I am very concerned why they would want to amputate the foot that has life in it, why cannot they jus remove the infection, they have not told me how far is the infection but her foot was dark and since her sugar is being controlled i realize that the color is coming back slightly. Could u provide me with some information as I dont want her foot to be amputated and especially the fact that the swollen foot is not that swollen anymore?",
