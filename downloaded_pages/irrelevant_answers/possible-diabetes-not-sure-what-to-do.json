            "answer": "Hi Carly,We are not doctors on this panel, just people with diabetes or parents of diabetics, so please don't take my word for medical truth. But I will say that you certainly seem to have all the classic symptoms of diabetes. Although your blood-glucose levels seem to have a mind of their own.My suggestion would be to find a specialist-- an endocrinologist. He or she might have more insight into your situation than a GP. You can ask your GP for a referral, or see if you can find a personal referral.You seem on top of the situation and wise to want to get to the bottom of this. Good luck finding an endocrinologist, and let us know how it goes.",

            "answer": "Thank you for the advise.I had another fasting blood sugar test done during the week + other blood tests. I saw my old GP rather than thenew one instead. My GP said it was a little high (6.6mmol/l). I told her about the increase in my bsl during the day so she spoke to another GP re: my results + the bsl at the clinic and it's been decided I need to have a glucose tolerance test.I wasn't sure if here in Australia we can find personal referrals + didn't think my GP would do a referral, but I did email a diabetes specialistnurse who gave me permission to call Tuesday morning after 8:30 to discuss \"an appropriate plan of action\" .Thanks again, hopefully I can get this sorted out soon.",

    "question": "I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes at the moment, but I do have the symptoms.For 5/6 weeks now I've been more tired than usual, thirsty, needing to void more often, and unintended weight loss.I mentioned the symptoms to my GP, she did a random blood sugar which was 11.4mmol/l. I followed up later in the week and my RBSL was 9.8mmol/l. So she sent my for a fasting blood sugar which came back in the upper normal range. My GP told that over the phone and said the a) continue monitoring my blood sugar levels, b) diet, c) be monitored while on prednisolone in the future (not a prob I have asthma and am often started on pred in hospital) that's what she thought caused my blood sugar levels to be elevated, but the diabetes symptoms started before taking prednisolone). and d) come back in 6 months for another fasting blood sugar test.Problem; This was over 2 weeks ago. I've been monitoring my bsl's, continue to have diabetes symptoms, and my bsl's are still high and getting higher.I'm happy that my morning / fasting blood sugar levels a fine - between 3-5mmol/l. However during the day the steadily rise and hit a peak at about 3pm usually between 14-16mmol/l now - it was 10-12mmol/l. Once I reach that peak my bsl's start to decrease again and I go to bed, (exhausted) with a level of 6-7mmol/l.I'm frustrated; I don't know what to do from here. I'm still very thirsty, tired, losing weight (I am 156cm tall and 42.5kilos from 47kilos), my food intake hasn't changed. I'm wondering could it be diabetes and should I go back to my GP?Thanks,Carly.",
