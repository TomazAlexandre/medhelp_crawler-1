            "answer": "Your doctor really should be testing FREE T3 and FREE T4 and basing your meds adjustments on those, rather than TSH.\u00a0\u00a0However, if your TSH is \"just barely normal\", then, yes, you most likely need an increase.\u00a0\u00a0Is she testing FT3 and FT4, too?\u00a0\u00a0TSH range is much too high at most labs.\u00a0\u00a00.3-3.0 was recommended by AACE many years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Few doctors and labs use that range.Yes, most likely Hashi's...No causal relationship has been established between Hashi's and other AI diseases, but we do know that once you have one AI, you are more likely to get more than the general population is to get its first.",

            "answer": "Most, if not all, autoimmune conditions appear associated with the HLA (human leukocyte antigen) region.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you inherit a genetic predisposition the autoimmune disease will not occur unless there is an environmental trigger. Several trigger suspects include viruses, bacteria, diet, toxins, radiation, metal, estrogen, and chronic infections.Hashimoto's thyroiditis is seen with the HLA DR3 and HLA DR 5 gene. I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autoimmune pernicious anaemia (HLA DR5 gene) and non segmental vitiligo (possible abnormalities in the HLA D region genes).The following info is from the book \"The Everything Guide To Thyroid Disease\" by Theodore C. Friedman, MD, PhD and Winnie Yu Scherer...\"Although the majority of people with Hashimoto's will not develop any other disorders, it's important to know what some of these autoimmune conditions are in case you do start to experience symptoms. Keep in mind, too, that you may be more likely to develop Hashimoto's if you have one of these other conditions.Type 1 diabetesPernicious AnaemiaAddison's DiseaseVitiligoCeliac DiseaseAlopecia AretaSystematic Lupus Erthematosus (SLE)Rheumatoid ArthritisSjogren's SyndromeInflammatory Bowel DiseaseMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\"",

    "question": "My endocrinologist just called with my blood work results. She said my TSH was just barely not normal (she told me exact can't remember) but that my antibodies are 893. She said I have an auto immune disease (assuming hashimotos) and that she is going to increase my dose of levothyroxine.. Is that the normal way to treat hashimotos, even if my TSH is normal?And does hashimotos cause any other auto immune diseases? Thanks.",
