            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Non specific white matter changes can be due to old age, high BP, chronic headaches, migraines, diabetes, alcoholism, stroke, MS and Alzheimer\u2019s disease, and also due to viral encephalitis. Since all pathological causes seem unlikely in your case no follow up was advised.If you have a history of diabetes, high BP or migraines it could well explain the nonspecific white matter changes.As far as the leg numbness is concerned it could well be because of lumbar disc herniation or protrusion. I would suggest you to take rest apply ice packs on the back and take OTC antiinflammatories. B complex supplements and back exercises will also help.",

            "answer": "Thanks for answering my questions, but just to let you know that i am only 50 years old so the changes can't be due to old age, question though if these changes are seen in old age what is my future with these changes already happening, I have controlled high BP, what had happened was that I went into the ER dept. with a kidney stone which I have never had before and never want again and they sent me home that evening with my IV left in so I had to return the next day upon waking in the morning my leg was numb and I couldn't lift it up the muscle seemed weak, they ordered a ct lumbar scan which showed a few things nothing like the mri a neurosurgeon reviewed the scan and said he could understand if it was my right leg that had the symptoms but it didn't make sense that it was my left leg and asked at that time if there was lupus or ms in my family history, so after that blood test ruled out lupus and that is why i had the CT head which showed the results that i gave to you, i quess that is why i had the concern i do not smoke or drink alcohol or have chronic headaches, migraines,diabetes so i really would like to know if this is something that is seen in old age what changes am i going to have happen to me when i do get old, i am doing physio, i exercise every day at the gym, i eat healthy. just to let you know there is a family history of heart disease my dad was 49 years old when he had a stroke and my brother was 51 when he had a heart attach but they both smoked and lived a different lifesyle than i do,by the way i am having surgery to remove the stone it won't seem to come on its own. i am only concerned because i am still young and have been reasonably healthy until the change of life. thanks for taking the time to read and answer my questions",

    "question": "I woke up one morning with left leg numbness after many tests blood work,CT head,MRI nothing really got solved, I won't post the entire results not unless you want to hear them but a few concerns of mine MRI reads as followsThe cord reveals some very subtle and questionable linear increased signals mid-thoracic region at approximately thoracic 5,6,7 levels,The change questioned is subtle and again questionable.no cord expansion or other obvious ancillary findings.Impression thoracic spinal imaging revealing some very subtle and very questionable changes mid-spine as described above which may be artifactual. CT head there is a nonspecific faint 8 x 9.5 mm hypodensity in the periventricular white matter of the right frontal lobe. very subtle nonspecific focal hypodensities of the centrum semiovale of both cerebral hemispheres suspected.impression nonspecific white matter changes, as described above, the differential diagnosis includes ischemic as well as other causes. I guess my question is why does this not warrant followup maybe it means nothing and by the way my leg numbness is still there need to know what i should be doing to make someone take this a little more serious,they just said i don't have ms because my mri also said i have some traversing root involvement in the lumbar region with definite disc protrusion/extrusion on the left.I feel lost in the system ,you see to many different Doctors because they all specialize in different fields. hopefully you answer me back,thanks",
