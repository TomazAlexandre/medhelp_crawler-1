            "answer": "Your doctor will never know for sure if you have a thyroid problem or not if not tested further.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is a pituitary hormone that is affected by so many variables that it is totally inadequate as the sole diagnostic for thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0At best TSH is an indicator to be considered along with more important indicators such as symptoms (which you have), and also levels of the biologically active thyroid hormones, Free T3 and Free T4.\u00a0\u00a0Of these Free T3 is the most important because it largely regulates metabolism and many other body functions.\u00a0\u00a0Scientific studies have also shown that Free T3 correlated best with Free T3 and Free T4 and TSH did not correlate at all.You may have secondary hypothyroidism which is due to low output of TSH by the pituitary.\u00a0\u00a0This obviously will result in low levels of Free T3 and Free T4.\u00a0\u00a0To find out, you need to test for Free T3 and Free T4, along with TSH each time you go in for followup.\u00a0\u00a0If the doctor resists, then you should insist on it for the above reasons, and don't take no for an answer.\u00a0\u00a0Since hypothyroid patients are frequently low in other areas as well, I suggest that you should also test for Vitamin A, D, B12 and ferritin.When test results are available, if you will please post results and their reference ranges shown on the lab report, members will be glad to help interpret and advise further.",

Most older women are losing bone due to their combined sex steroid, DHEA, Vitamin D, and growth hormone deficiencies.

            "answer": "I have no experience with that issue, but I did dome reading and ran across this info.\"Diagnosis is usually verified by the presence of the typical whitish, scarred strip of hair loss at the hairline and possibly reddened, inflamed hair follicles. However, other evaluation methods may include a complete blood count, a thyroid function panel and other hormone tests.Oral steroids and antimalarials may temporarily slow the progression of hair loss, but they could have side effects such as depression, insomnia, abdominal pain, skin rashes and retina damage. And despite the assumed hormonal link, hormone replacement therapy has not been shown to be of any benefit.Some people think there is little that can be done for frontal fibrosing alopecia but this is not the case. Treatment is based around trying to control the inflammation causing the damage to the hair follicle. While hair can never grow back from a follicle that\u2019s been scarred, a personalised combination hair loss treatment course including minoxidil \u2013 a clinically proven hair growth stimulant \u2013 may prevent further hair loss and may thicken up existing hair. So meanwhile, quiz your stylist for clever techniques that will help conceal the areas of hair loss.Up to 50% of women experience hair loss after menopause and most of the time it\u2019s presented as diffuse-spread hair all over the scalp, or thinning hair at the crown. Clinical hair loss treatments have demonstrated to be many a girl\u2019s saving grace when it comes to maintaining hair growth, be it pre- or post-menopause.\"Does that sound like how your hair loss was diagnosed by the derm?\u00a0\u00a0The reason I ask is that your description of hair loss was \" eyebrows, arms, legs and some scalp thinning.\"\u00a0\u00a0Somehow this does not sound the same as the frontal fibrosing alopecia.\u00a0\u00a0So I wonder just how assured that diagnosis really is.\u00a0\u00a0I think that your symptoms, the cholesterol issue, and the liver issue\u00a0\u00a0indicate that you should do the additional thyroid testing, just to be sure.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest testing for Free T3 and Free T4 (not Total T3 and T4), along with Vitamin A, D, B12, and ferritin.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately, it does.\u00a0\u00a0All of my vitamin tests came in normal.\u00a0\u00a0A scalp biopsy was done and I will have definite results tomorrow. Eyebrow loss and upper body hair loss are not uncommon with this disease, which is very rare.\u00a0\u00a0 No one wanted to do a free T3 and Free T4, but derm did order all the sex hormone tests just to make sure.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently awaiting my HMO to approve a visit to an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Here is something interesting.\u00a0\u00a0The CARF (the organization responsible for the research in the type of alopecia) has had some new insights, which says that the use of Actos (a diabetes drug) has been shown to give benefits.\u00a0\u00a0It appears that there is a build up of toxic lipids in the patients with this disorder and this diabetes drug apparently aids with destroying the toxins.\u00a0\u00a0Here is what they say:The above treatments are usually effectivein controlling signs and symptomsbut may not halt progression of the hairloss since they do not address the underlyingpathophysiology. In a recentlandmark report,molecular studies ofscalp tissue from patients with lichenplanopilaris (LPP) revealed a loss ofperoxisome proliferator-activated receptorgamma (PPARg), a protein thatregulates inflammation and lipidmetabolism in the pilosebaceous unit.This loss leads to a buildup of toxiclipids that generates inflammation andeventual destruction of the hair follicleand sebaceous gland. A similar PPARgdeficiency has been found in frontalfibrosing alopecia.*Further study is still needed in centralcentrifugal cicatricial alopecia and theneutrophilic cicatricial alopecias. Therole of PPARg in cicatricial alopecia issupported in mice in which a targeteddeletion of PPARg in follicular stem cellscauses scarring alopecia.These findings suggested that treatmentwith PPARg agonists may provide a newupstream treatment strategy for patientswith LPP and frontal fibrosing alopecia.Pioglitazone and rosiglitazone are glitazonesand PPARg agonists that are FDAapprovedand used widely to treat type 2diabetes mellitus as well as atopic dermatitis.Pioglitazone was successful in a47 year-old male patient with active andsymptomatic LPP who had failed all treatments.**The most common side effect of theglitazones is dosage dependent weightgain as a result of fluid retention andedema. Other reported adverse reactionsinclude an increased risk of myocardialinfarction with rosiglitazone, CYPP450 drug interactions with pioglitazoneThey use drugs like Actos.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think Actos could also lower my cholesterol and improve my liver panels which have come back lousy (again)?",
