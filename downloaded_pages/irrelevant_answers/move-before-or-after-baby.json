            "answer": "I think the wife should move before baby comes. Air travel is unsafe after 32 weeks, some doctors say 36 weeks. It will be very difficult for her to move and settle into a new home and find a new doctor after baby is born. It's just too much stress when trying to learn to breastfeed and bond with baby.",

            "answer": "half of my post is gone...dad is going to want to spend his time bonding with baby and not moving. That will take 100% of his time.\u00a0\u00a0There are also way too many what ifs to do that.\u00a0\u00a0What if baby is in nicu in one state while you are moving to another.\u00a0\u00a0What would you do?\u00a0\u00a0Also mom is going to not be healed until 2 weeks AT THE LEAST after an uncomplicated vaginal birth, 6weeks after c section, possibly longer.\u00a0\u00a0she will be much more able to move pregnant than just after having a baby.\u00a0\u00a0i could not imagine the stress of knowing the huge change of a baby coming and a big move.\u00a0\u00a0I dont know.\u00a0\u00a0I just know that I like to have everything in perfect order before my son came and hope for the same with this one.\u00a0\u00a0Even if she doesnt feel it now...she will.\u00a0\u00a0It is part of the whole process!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck in your decision and my vote obviously is with move now!",

            "answer": "Thanks for the clarification. I also wanted to address the momma-to-be's diabetes and other issues. It will be a lot harder to move with a newborn. Period. I would never want to move with a newborn, whether I was doing anything or not.Because the wife has diabetes, she may run the risk of giving birth prematurely too. So it would be good for her to be settled in the home they'll be staying at, especially if baby were to have to stay in a NICU or something.Even if the military moves everything, the wife and husband are the ones to unpack and put their home together. That would be much easier on her when she's 15-19 weeks (when she'd have the most energy anyway) than when she's sleep deprived and just given birth.I don't know. It just seems like too much to have a baby and have to move and put a home together.",

            "answer": "First of all, thank you all for your input. I also posted this question to the MD forum.Secondly, here is the information you seek: I am daddy's mother. I am of course concerned about my daughter-in-law and my grandbaby, I am also concerned with the limited amount of time my son will have to bond not only with his pregnant wife (this was a rapid marriage due to the pregnancy & they have only been together since September 2008) but also his baby. Her family is insisting she stay in CA with the notion that it is SAFER for her. I am a nurse and have told BOTH my son and daughter-in-law that if she were to move before the baby is born, I will NOT allow her to be alone. My daughters and I would spend the summer in IL with her until my son returns from Afghanistan. Between my son and I, arrangements can be made for her family (all or part) to ALSO accompany her in IL and/or travel back and forth as needed per job issues. My son, on the other hand, will not have such liberties when he is stateside either. He CAN get up to 90 days 'emergency leave' but that will count against any FUTURE leave time he accrues.",

Don't see that happening with a ton of family around every minute.Of course, I would love to be in CA or IL when the baby is born, but being a girl, I recognize the primary importance of maternal family being there.My son as well as I, grew up in IL, I have medical connections there and can help find good doctors once she and the baby get there (before or after birth).",

I hope that your DIL is able to make the appropriate choice for herself, without interference from her family (of which can be VERY influencial, especially if this is her first pregnancy).And hey, let us know what she ends up deciding to do! I'll probably worry about her even though I don't know.",

What would the potential negatives be? At what point in the pregnancy would air travel be restricted?Would it be safer for the wife stay in CA until after the baby is born? At what point after the baby is born would the wife be okay to relocate with the newborn? Should she wait for her post-natal check? Or would it be okay to relocate and return for the post-natal visit? Would air travel be safe for the post-natal visit?Husband was deployed 1 week after learning of the pregnancy (1 day after 1st doctor visit); the military will allow 2 weeks off upon return from deployment; husband will be required to attend 4 weeks training in FL for new assignment shortly after return from deployment; after training, there is a 3 week time allowance before reporting to new assignment; husband will get 10 days maternity leave.Timeline made simple:Day 1: Pregnancy confirmed with MD; 6wks gestation, due date of Oct. 24th givenDay 2: Husband is deployed overseasMid-Aug: Husband returns to CAEarly Sept: Husband enters 4 weeks training in FLEarly Oct: Husband searches for housing and relocates to ILLate Oct: Baby is bornFollowing birth: Husband has 10 days leave???: Wife and baby relocate before or after birth???",
