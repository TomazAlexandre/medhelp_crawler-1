            "answer": "With a blood test they could check for troponin protein levels. These proteins are released when the heart muscle has been damaged, such as occurs with a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the greater the amount of troponin there will be in the blood.You could do the test, however if troponin levels are not elevated, it does not mean you are safe, it just means that there is no heart damage (yet).If they are elevated, you have already (some) heart damage.With your symptoms go see a doctor.",

            "answer": "Elevated troponin levels in the blood mean that your heart is injured.Angina that lasts for 0-20 minutes does normally not raise the troponin in the blood because, although the heart is suffering from lack of oxygen, it is not injured permanently, no heart cells are lost.If your angina lasts for longer than +/- 20 minutes, heart muscle starts to die and troponin levels rise. This is irreversible damage as lost heart muscle cells are not regenerated.",
