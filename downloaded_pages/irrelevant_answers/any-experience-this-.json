            "answer": "I have a friend whose doctor tried to tell her she had gestational diabetes, and the drugs they gave her made her blood sugar go down to 50, she stopped taking them, and her doctor always said how good her blood sugar was doing at the appointments, doctors are idiots sometimes. The moral of this is be self monitoring,\u00a0\u00a0if you feel your blood sugar and BP stay fairly normal skip the meds, but monitor.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the input about your friend. I just am beside myself because bp is exactly the same as it was before I was pregnant and now all of a sudden I have protein in my urine. I just find it odd that all the websites say being dehydrated affects your results as do taking antibiotics and I was on antibiotics and told them I suspected I was dehydrated and they didn't think anything of it. I don't want to not take meds if I need to but I also don't want my bp dropping so low that I can't function!!",

            "answer": "My doctor tried to put me on a very high dose of high blood pressure medication. When I told him I would like to start bed rest he refused, so I switched. And now on bed rest my pressure is down.\u00a0\u00a0One thing I noticed though is that my blood pressure rises way up in the doctors office not so sure why though. Hope yours goes down by it self good luck.",

    "question": "So I'm 9 weeks today and my bp is always high when I go to the doc. I'm a nervous person and it just is. I always take it at home though and record it so they can check them. They always are 115-118 over 65-70 at home. But since it was high at the office I had to do a 24 hr urine. I read online being dehydrated and taking antibiotics can affect the results although I'm not sure how they affect them. I was on macrobid antibiotic which they prescribed and I was throwing up all day the day of my urine collection and could hardly keep down fluids. Anyways they called today and said they did find protein And blood work came back with glucose slightly elevated. She did ask if I had anything surgary right before the test and I did have a sprite to calm my stomach and because I hadn't eaten anything almost in 24 hrs. It wasn't fasting blood work so I wasn't told not to eat or drink. So now they want to do an A1c and put me on bp meds. Anyone else have this issue? Or have a clear A1c after elevated glucose? I'm just so upset because I'm carrying twins and the prospect of both diabetes and hypertension is scary to me. I had controlled hypertension with first baby then it went away when not pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0But I never had a diabetic issue! :(",
