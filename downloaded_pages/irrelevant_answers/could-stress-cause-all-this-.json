            "answer": "Wow you are under a great load. You need to find some time for yourself it at all possible. I know it's tough though.I reply to this because many of the symptoms I had that I didn't know which are similar to yours, dizziness, headaches, bothered from light, sleeplessness, etc., my doctors told me it was stress. They also told me it was heart disease and the stress was taking its toll on me.So I went through all of these tests, where were ok, but to find nothing wrong. So after 6 months of poking and proding they just threw their hands up. So for the next year or so I went along the same way. Then found I had diabetes. Started attending to that and most of my issues left me.I still get the headaches and problems breathing, heart palps, etc. when I have a heavy stress day. So I would say that yes, stress can cause all these but it's important to make sure you exhaust all your medical resources too. Good luckWhat I did and do for stress relief is to take a walk by myself. Do something you like to do, be that reading or whatever. The point is that I needed to spend some time to myself figuring out what the deal was so I could attend to it. If you are always inundated with the problems you never get to see through that fog. I hope you find your way.",

            "answer": "It's probably just stress. Do you have health insurance? Are you able to get another opinion just to put your mind at ease? Stress is unbelievable good at causing all kinds of crazy little symptoms and especially if you are hyper focused on something. If your doctors aren't worried about it, try not to worry too much unless the pain is extreme or sudden. What you are describing sounds like migraine auras to me. (the visual stuff)I don't know what to tell you about how to de-stress. I'm not very adept in that area. To say the least. Maybe try a counselor or something to help you work through your recent divorce and help you get back on your feet again with a job and stuff. I was in your exact same shoes at one time. It's enough to give anyone strange head pains and more. I wish you the best.",

            "answer": "First of all, why are you not okay with antidepressants?\u00a0\u00a0Is it the lame stereo-types that go along with those drugs?\u00a0\u00a0Worse than that, why would you not listen to your primary physician.... the person you pay to assist you in your health???Every symptom you mentioned can be attributed to stress/anxiety/depression, and I am really suprised that your endocrinologist doesn't believe that mood can affect your blood sugar levels....\u00a0\u00a0(I think its slightly abnormal to have an endocrinologist in the pre-diabetic stage.... I am type 2 diabetic, have never seen a endo... keep my blood sugar in line with a med, diet, and regular exercise.) The fact that you have taken your pre-diabetic serious enough to develop a relationship with an endocrinologist cracks me up when you aren't taking any of your stress/depression/anxiety issues up with someone qualified enough to better help you deal with that.... and just a pointer, do not let your endocrinologist speak to you about mental health issues.... he/she is not qualified unless he/she has a degree in mental health.\u00a0\u00a0A therapist/counselor/psychiatrist/psychologist is someone I'd put my mental health with, and an endo can help me with my blood sugar. (You wouldn't ask a mechanic a question about paint, would you???)I can tell you this.\u00a0\u00a0Stress/anxiety/depression are probably killing as many people as diabetes in this country.\u00a0\u00a0Like diabetes, depression/anxiety/stress often goes undiagnosed there for eventually costing lives.\u00a0\u00a0Like diabetes, stress/depression/anxiety are all treatable but you have to get diagnosed.... I think your primary physician is on the right path, and your reluctance to follow his/her advice will be a big mistake.\u00a0\u00a0Antidepressants can affect blood sugar levels, and some are perfectly suitable for people diagnosed as depressed....",

            "answer": "I do have medical insurance still (not yet divorced, so I am still under my husband's insurance right now)...but the problem is that I have NO money. I can't even pay the co-payments. My husband gets the bills for these and then freaks out on me for \"spending money\" (that is literally the only thing I spend money on, is my health). But we're having MAJOR issues with finances and bills and such. It's a long story there. But I digress....I do have insurance but I'm often scared to use it or go to my doctors over and over because I don't have the money to even pay the co-payments or any bills and they just add up.Thank you so much for your reply though.",

            "answer": "I don't want to be on even more meds than I already am. And I had other doctors (I've seen other primary doctors) tell me that the anti-depressants may cause WORSE headaches and they wouldn't necessarily recommend them to me. So yeah, I am very very concerned about the medications I put in my body and how they will affect me. I want to explore all OTHER options before I have to resort to meds.Also, I'm seeing an endocrinologist for my hypothyroidism AND for my PCOS. Not JUST because I'm pre-diabetic. It's not at all abnormal for me to see and endocrinologist for my health issues I have. In fact, it's recommended. What \"cracks me up\" about your response is that you didn't seem to read ALL of my post.Your response seemed a little rude. Thanks anyway.",

            "answer": "Not rude at all, and I am sorry you took it that way.\u00a0\u00a0Immediately when I saw diabetes and endocrinologist, I simply made the leap and didn't see into your other issues.\u00a0\u00a0One would think the stress from the other issues would be enough to give one headaches and cause other stress.Something else you may want to look into is the fat that you may be over medicated.\u00a0\u00a0This happened with my grandmother, for years.\u00a0\u00a0She had a doctor for all causes, and somewhere along the line she ended up being over medicated.\u00a0\u00a0She spent a week in the hospital, had lots of blood work done and got her meds under control again.And the reason I question you and your view of anti depressants is because I used to think that there wasnt a problem out there that I couldnt handle.\u00a0\u00a0Turns out, I was wrong and elected my problems to manifest for years... decades even.\u00a0\u00a0I know take an antidepressant and it changed my life.\u00a0\u00a0Anti-depressant and counseling changed my life, saved my marriage and my relationship with my children.",

    "question": "My symptoms: mild to extreme dizziness... weird dull pain in right side of my brain (always the same spot) and the pain gets sharp with pressure (such as sneezing, coughing, physical exertion) or stress and tension... fatigue during the day, difficulty sleeping or flat-out insomnia during the night (brain pain wakes me up at night and seems worse at night and in the morning)... occasional vision problems in right eye (spots and shadows and such)... sensitivity to sound... balance issues... fuzziness/confusion/memory difficulties (esp. when stressed)... neck/shoulder tension when stressed... occasional brain clicking/crunching sound at base of neck/brain... occasional mild numbness of right side of face and right arm/hand...Duration: been having these issues since April 2010, off and on. This latest episode has been going on for about a month and a half.What has been done: CT scan in April 2010 (outcome normal), MRI in May 2010 (outcome normal...change in white matter in right frontal lobe and that was explained to me as \"normal\"), and lumbar puncture in April 2010 (outcome normal).What my doctors are saying: It's just migraines or stress.I'm freaking out though. I'm worried it's a brain tumor or aneurysm or maybe even stroke. I'm a single mom, I just left my husband this month and have nowhere to go, no job (was a stay-home mom for 6 years), no car, no money, etc. I am under an INSANE amount of stress. Not to mention all the other health issues I have been dealing with (hypothyroid, pre-diabetes, PCOS). I can't even work or drive with all this crap going on...I'm so dizzy and whatnot that it's impossible!What I'm asking is....could all those symptoms REALLY just be stress?? And if so, what can I do to help myself?? My primary doc just wants to put me on anti-deppressants (which I'm not okay with) and my endocrinologist doesn't think I NEED to do that (the antidepressants) yet. I saw another doc who says no to those meds also, but wants me to try some stronger headache meds.",
