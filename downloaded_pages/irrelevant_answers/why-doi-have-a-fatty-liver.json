            "answer": "Hi,I don't know how long it will take, with good control, but I imagine it will be at least a few months.4 (72) is a decent minimum number for blood glucose.15 (270) is really on the high side and will still result in damage, though indeed is much better than your previous numbers which were close to 400 based on your Hba1c of 13.3.Would suggest that you try to narrow the range that your sugars are moving in.\u00a0\u00a04 - 7/8 (126 - 144), would be a more ideal range.\u00a0\u00a0You could do this by following a very low carb diet, with moderate protein, and fat to satiety.\u00a0\u00a0You can see this approach on \"Bernstein Diabetes University\" on U-tube or get and study his book \"Diabetes Solutions\" by Dr. Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0 IF you do follow a low carb diet monitor your insulin levels very closely as you may well need to reduce your dosing.\u00a0\u00a0Please work with your Dr as much as possible, but also realize that control is really up to you and should be in your hands.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "means it's swollen beyond its normal size. There's usually another condition that's causing it, such as hepatitis. You have a lot of treatment choices, but you first need to find out the source of the problem.Getting treated is important. Your liver has a lot of big jobs to do. Just to name a few key ones, it helps clean your blood by getting rid of harmful chemicals that your body makes. It makes a liquid called bile, which helps you break down fat from food. And it also stores sugar, called glucose, which gives you a quick back-up energy boost when you need it.",
