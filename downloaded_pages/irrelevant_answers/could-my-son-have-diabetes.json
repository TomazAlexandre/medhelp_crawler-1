            "answer": "The classic symptoms of diabetes are:*\tfrequent urination, with large volumes of urine,*\texcessive thirst,*\thunger, and*\tweight loss.Other symptoms might include:*\tfatigue,*\tblurry vision,*\todd aches and pains,*\tdry mouth,*\tdry or itchy skin,*\tpoor healing of cuts and scrapes, or*\texcessive or unusual infections.Since your son seems to have some of the symptoms, I would recommend making an appointment with his doctor to have a blood test done to see if his glucose levels are normal. This is an easy test to do, and you and your child deserve to konw for sure whether his levels are high or even perhaps low (being hard to awaken in the mornings COULD be a symptom of hypoglycemia or possibly being due to the fatigue of untreated diabetes).As for the stomach problems... you may also want to ask your doctor to test him for Celiac Disease (inability to digest gluten). A fairly large percentage of type 1 diabetics have been diagnosed as having celiac disease also. In fact, some doctors think that ALL diabetics should be tested for Celiac, just to be sure.
