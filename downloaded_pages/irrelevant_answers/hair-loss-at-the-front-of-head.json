            "answer": "Hello,This type of hair loss or baldness can be due to male pattern baldness. Androgenic alopecia is a common form of hair loss and typically occurs in M shaped pattern.Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait. Other causes may be use of some drugs, infections and underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. A biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope) of your scalp may be needed to establish the correct diagnosis.Medicines which are useful are minoxidil and finasteride. Finally one can resort to hair transplantation also. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi,I'm female, 30 years old. Have had no children and get regular periods. I have had no health problems before. And my weight is normal.My problem is my hair is thinning around the front. It's noticeable where my hair meets at the front and u can see a wider parting. I'm so conscious about it. Why is this happening. My hair used to be very thick and I've always had a lot of it so much that the hairdressers would always say u have so much hair! My mum has a full head of thick hair at 53. My dads family have history of thinning hair.",
