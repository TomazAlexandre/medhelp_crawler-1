            "answer": "Hopefully you can connect with a good childrens Dr. I have been diabetic since I was 4 (36 years) and can remember experiences like that as a child. If you make a timeline on a piece of graph paper, and record when he eats (and what) and the timing and dosage of his shots, you will see a trend. It helps the Drs. since they can't be there. Trying to keep my activity level constant and at the same time every day was one of my parents difficult tasks, but they trained me when I was young to be active and consistant. Ups and downs happen for all diabetics, but explaining how you feel when you are 3 can be tough! My doctors at Joslin Clinic in Boston kept me and my parents there for several weeks when I was first diagnosed, and my parents were sent to classes, while the docs got me regulated. I am not sure what is done now, but hope things are still the same for the parents. Hopefully you're doctor has access to a dietician also as they are important. Take care and best of luck!",

    "question": "My 3 year old was diagnosed w/ Type 1 diabetes about 9 monthes ago. I am very worried about the long term complications of (& low)high blood suger. His readings are usually over 300 in the afternoon. We have tried several different insulin combos (Lantus, novalog, novalin). It's a constant battle to get him to eat the right things at the right times. He has woke up in the morning w/ seizures a few times due to low blood sugar & is almost always on the low side in the morning. I dont give him a\u00a0\u00a0night shot unless he's over 300 & he will still wake up w/ under 100 in the morning. Dr.s dont seem to be of much help, they just give trial & error suggestions. I just moved to Montana & have only found 1 endo & he's not a juvi endo. Have searched for groups or any other parents/relatives with kids who have diabetes & not found anything. My son is so young & I can only hope that managment will get easier as he grows older. Any suggestions, encouragemnet or similar expereriences would be much appreciated.",
