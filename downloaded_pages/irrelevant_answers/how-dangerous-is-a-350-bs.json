            "answer": "Hi,If you have enough insulin production of your own, then 350 glucose is bad but will not get you hospitalized. Right now we do not know that ofcourse, so this is quite a gamble. At 300's you will be spilling glucose into your urine and likely have some kidney damage if that continues.Many organs in the body do not do well with sugars that high. Overall as you know, it is very bad to be that high all the time.For diet: Try to eat complex carbohydrates instead of simple ones, stay away from ALL sodas and juices right now, eat proteins and veggies more than heavy carb meals, and ofcourse avoid all sweets. Most importantly, look into seeing doctor at the public health department, or a free clinic in your area. Many cities have free clinics where you can also get drug samples. A few months could do alot of damage and even become life threatening, so please try to be seen somewhere soon.Take care.",

            "answer": "I'm 56 and developed diabetes a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0I wake up to 80 - 90 fasting BS. If I eat according to guideline..my BS will go to about 150 - 170. Walking right after eating will knock about 40 off of each number. Movement is key in my case. I've cut out white bread, white rice and sweets. I eat ALOT of vegetables and some fruit. I eat apples as snacks and take them with me incase I feel my BS go low. I don't take any pills and have love 90 lb in the last year. I was 300 lb. I've got 50 lbs more to lose. I think this was the single most important thing I've done for\u00a0\u00a0my heath. I also hope you'll find help for yourself soon, especially if outside factors are NOT the case. If they are..you CAN help yourself greatly. That's the good news!I have been told that if my BS is lower than 100...that I should get it higher before doing excercise or walking . If it's over 200 I should not exert myself and if it's over 300 to call a doctor. There are ways to find medical help without excersice. I believer some pharmacies inside supermarkets these days offer help for people without insurance. Check into that, and good luck.",
