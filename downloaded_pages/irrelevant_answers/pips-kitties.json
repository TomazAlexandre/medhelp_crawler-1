Anita must be missing her family, soon you'll be all together again, best of luck:)",

    "question": "Hey all, progress report here.Well, Teia, Hildie and Chessie definitely know something is up.\u00a0\u00a0All their old, comfortably smelly carpet is gone, the kitchen and front entry have laminate flooring and most rooms are freshly painted, plus most all of the other familiar stuff is in boxes or piled up to go in the shipping container.Hildie definitely misses her sister, Kessie, and I think she's looking for Anita, too.Miss Hildie (as I indicated in another thread) has early stage diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Doc Knilans recommended a long acting insulin (ProZinc, 40 unit vial, along with U40 syringes), which is formulated for kitties.\u00a0\u00a0He started Hildie on 1 unit every 12 hours and we'll double check the glucose next Friday to see how her body is responding.\u00a0\u00a0I gave her the first dose at his office and the 2nd this morning.\u00a0\u00a0She barely needs any restraint, seems to know this will help her (I also give her a couple of her favorite Greenies stomach health treats before and after).\u00a0\u00a0All other blood work was normal or only slightly off, which he thinks will mitigate as the diabetes is treated and we get the girls on a more consistently carnivorous diet.Miss Chessie had to be sedated in order for Doc to get a blood sample (she's a very strong little bugger).\u00a0\u00a0He kept her overnight, trimmed her hind hair and her cleaned her nether region, cleaned her ears and brushed out some thick undercoat.\u00a0\u00a0All the blood indicators were in the normal level.\u00a0\u00a0The ear problem looks mitigated by use of the eardrops he gave us, there is still a mild discharge, but the bad odor is gone and the benign tumors look no larger than last month.Miss Teia is slated for her elder kitty bloodwork next Wednesday.So, life continue at the, now, temporary headquarters of Catamount Grange.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully we'll be joining Anita in Maryland for good by the end of the month.",
