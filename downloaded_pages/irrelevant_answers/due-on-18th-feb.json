Had one last week and it was painful and uncomfortable. :( Plus my doctor said she won't allow her patients to go past 5 days after their due dates. Kinda good to know at least by this weekend I will have my little baby in my arms.",

    "question": "3 days to go till I'm 40 weeks! I had my check up last week and doctor said baby's head is already engaged. According to her gut, the baby would probably arrive before my due date, but my gut says otherwise. I haven't lost my mucus plug, my contractions aren't that bad (felt more like tightening of the stomach). Just that i sometimes feel really sore at my pelvis when i wake up and i sometimes go on an emotional rollercoaster. I'm almost 40 weeks and I sometimes forget that I'm even pregnant. Lol. Doctor said she'll only induce me after my due date since I don't have either gestational diabetes nor high blood pressure. Can't wait to meet my little son. Hope he'd come out soon.",
