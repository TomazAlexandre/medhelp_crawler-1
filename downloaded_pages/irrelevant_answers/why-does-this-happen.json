    "question": "In January I joined the gym. I am 57 years old and have only lost 22 lbs so far. I have been going like a maniac on the treadmill; in fact the heartrate usually reads 200. My ankles swell at night. Why can't the scale go down anymore. I also lift weights and do leg presses. Stomach machine, you name it! I can compete with some of the younger people there when I go on the bike, I can go for 3 miles straight. Why the hell can't I drop any more weight. I am on a 1,000 cal a day diet.",
