            "answer": "I do not have all the answers for you, however the GFR rate it pretty low. Mine was considered low as well, at 63.4.\u00a0\u00a0My URO said however that a 24 hour urine would give a better overall picture of what my rates are!\u00a0\u00a0He also said these test (the GFR rate),are a predicter and not always completely accurate.LIke you I have no insurance... however I have a lot of out of pocket medical expenses... esp. right now so we are waiting to do another 24 hour urine untill some more pressing urinary issues are treated!I did do a lot of research on my own, about this rte and kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0One thing i read was limiting your protein intake can really help the kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0Meats are really hard on our kidneys and I read that limiting your meat consumption to about 6oz a day and using alternative foods (nuts, grains etc.)\u00a0\u00a0to get your needed protein can actually help or even slow the progression of kidney disease. You might consider checking into this with your doctor!I hope someone with more info. can help you!\u00a0\u00a0I know when got my blood test and saw the low rating etc, it was a little scary, so wanted to at least post!\u00a0\u00a0Sorry i don't have more info.Shelly",

            "answer": "I too don't have any answers, but I'll be glad to share my experience.\u00a0\u00a0In January, after yet another angiogram and stent, I was referred to a nephrologist because my GFR then was 59.\u00a0\u00a0It is now 50, and I'm not as panicky as I was initially.\u00a0\u00a0My nephrologist says they don't start looking at dialysis/transplant until the GFR reaches 15 or so.\u00a0\u00a0So we have some time.\u00a0\u00a0They'll do bloodwork now every couple of months (at first it was every week!), and I'm scheduled for a biopsy in a couple of weeks.\u00a0\u00a0In case there is a nephritis that can be treated with steroids, we'll do the biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0But more than likely, it's my long-standing history of hypertension that's the culprit.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps some.Do take care.Angie",
