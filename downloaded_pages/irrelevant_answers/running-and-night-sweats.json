            "answer": "There are no other symptoms present, i actually feel better now that Ive been running than before i started exercising and having these night sweats. i remember having these night sweats about a year ago but i wasn't worried about them because i could link them to when i had a bad hangover over a night of heavy drinking. someone told me since your body core temp is up from working out and the weather is cold that when you bundle up for the cold weather that is the reason, is that possible? i don't have insurance at the moment (monetary issues), have no medical history, but if it is necessary i should get it checked if it persists. thanks for your advice.",

    "question": "Hi everyone, i had a question concerning night sweats and running. i am 28 male, and just recently 2 week ago started running trying to get back in shape and cutting my smoking habit. have been smoking almost a pack a day now down to 1/2 a pack a day. Ive noticed that since i started running, i get night sweats occasionally. its not a drenching in sweat more like a mild moist sweat. is this normal, has anyone else experienced this?",
