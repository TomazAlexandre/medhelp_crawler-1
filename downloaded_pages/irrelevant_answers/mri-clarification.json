            "answer": "Hello.Do you have hypertension detected? High blood pressure is associated with multiple sites of small infarcts in the white matter, at the junction of white matter and the gray matter. This condition needs to be followed up regularly. A repeat MRI should be done after about six months. The balance issues are worrisome. They seem a bit more extensive than what the MRI would suggest. I was expecting a cerebellar lesion.Regards",

            "answer": "Dr Deshmukh,Thank you for your response.My blood pressure has always been very good.\u00a0\u00a0I think the highest it has ever been was 128/90 give or take. I do not have diabetes, but I do suffer from headaches.\u00a0\u00a0I am 40 years old and work out about 3-5 days a week, it hasn't helped me lose weight but I still do it.\u00a0\u00a0I am 5'3\", 165 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0So I am about 40-45 pounds overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I am also a smoker.When I had the nerve test done (my sister was with me during the tests), the lady doing the test at one point said \"I am going to have to go get something to warm up your arms to see if what I am seeing is accurate.\"\u00a0\u00a0She said it was showing that my nerves were slow.\u00a0\u00a0When she warmed up my arms she said there was not much improvement.\u00a0\u00a0So I was a little surprised when the doctor said everything was fine.The neurologist said that my exam was normal, the nerve test/EMG (arms only) and MRI was normal.\u00a0\u00a0On my last visit with him he asked me \"do you need to see me anymore\".\u00a0\u00a0I told him I would come back if I needed to.\u00a0\u00a0It just seems that maybe there should have been a follow up MRI or maybe some more test.\u00a0\u00a0A few friends have suggested getting a 2nd opinion but I don't want to make a big deal out of nothing.Thanks again for your time, it is greatly appreciated.",

    "question": "Could I get some advice/clarification in regards to MRI results.I have been having some neurological issues, which was the reason for the MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I have loss of balance, tripping, dropping things, falling to the side, back when walking and standing.\u00a0\u00a0I can not stand without holding onto something.\u00a0\u00a0I sometimes have speech problems, mumbling, slurring.\u00a0\u00a0I also have widespread pain in arms, legs, knees, elbows etc.\u00a0\u00a0I have had twitiching of the fingers on my left hand and also on my toe of my right foot.\u00a0\u00a0I will also get muscle twitching in my calf, thighs, arms, ribs.\u00a0\u00a0If I try to hold paper or something in my hand, my hand gets weak.\u00a0\u00a0I am also having a very hard time with remembering things.\u00a0\u00a0I have to really focus on things (in a distance) before they come clear.\u00a0\u00a0My right leg gets numb and feels like I have less control of it than my left leg.This is the results of the MRI \"FLAIR imaging sequence demonstrates two focal abnormal bright intensity foci in the subcortical white matter of the left frontal lobe and about four to five subcortical bright intensity foci in the left parietal white matter.\u00a0\u00a0A single lesion is seen in the right parietal subcortical white matter.\u00a0\u00a0These are most likely due to chronic small vessel disease and ischemic changes.\"With the results of the MRI should there be a follow up MRI done at a later date?\u00a0\u00a0I did have a Nerve Conduction Test which showed minor abnormalties (but nothing to worry about according to the neurologist).\u00a0\u00a0The EMG was normal and a eye exam was normal.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist does not feel there is a need to do a follow up MRI at a later date, and I am not sure if I am comfortable with that at this point.Any insight you can give me would be greatly appreciate.",
