            "answer": "Hi, i think anti natal care is very important for both you and your baby. There are test they do to determin if there is anything wrong with your baby also for yourself like GD. The doctor tracks both yours and the babys progress. I had the reguler 19-20 week ultrasound which showed that my placenta has attatched to low. I will be 34 weeks on friday and have to have another ultrasound to see if it has corrected itself. If it has i can have a natural birth if it hasn't i have to have a c-section. If it wasn't for seeing my doctor and having the ultrasounds done this would not have been detected. Seeing the doctor regularly has been great for me if there is anything you arn't sure of or want to know they can answer your questions. Please see a doctor for both you and your baby. You will also be able to find out an accuret date of when your due:)",

            "answer": "I agree with them... I waited to my 3rd month and had so many scares, especially with it being my first child.Thank God everything turned out to be okay. Its best for you and the baby to get all the necessary attention to catch any complications early cause with most of them you must catch early or there is nothing you can do about it. And it helps to see a doctor to clear out all the questions you may have scrambling your brain the rest of your pregnancy. Just think of your childs life!!! Good Luck!",
