I had a vaginal delivery. and contractions hurt really bad. your stomach gets really tight. and then after the contraction your stomach will be fine. it is painful though. and the closer your contractions are the more pain you are in. that's all I can really remember. your stomach gets really really tight. I hope everything works out for you. they can also induce your labor if the baby is too big so you can have it naturally.",

    "question": "Wondered if anyone has heard or been in my situation and can help advise.I'm pregnant with my second child my first was born at 32 weeks by emergency c sec and I am now being consultant led throughout my pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to try for a natural delivery but been told they will have to monitor babies size as if gets too big I wont be able to deliver naturally as size will put too much strain on the scar.\u00a0\u00a0 I have now developed diabetes which can make babies bigger, my question is will this rule out my chances of natural birth? I know it prob sounds strange but I really want to know what a contraction feels like and don't want this taken away from me again but obviously will do whichever is safest for baby x",
