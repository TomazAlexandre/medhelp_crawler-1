            "answer": "Yes the glucose test was the test for diabetes which was normal. Haliwali that ultrasound will definitely put me at ease.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to be sure my baby isn't to big or that my due date isn't wrong. I'm going to eat more veggies and fruits to make sure its not what I'm eating. I don't over eat but I tend to eat a lot of the same things. I do drink a lot of water so I very rarely drink sodas or juices. At this point I have to wait for the call about a date for the ultrasound.",

            "answer": "Well my doctor is starting to make me think she is off. I did not need this ultrasound. The baby is only 3 pounds and 3 ounces. I'm so glad cause I was thinking about having to push out her big body but now I need to question my doctor to see if she is crazy. Lol she probably just didn't take the measurement right.",

    "question": "My due date is march 31st. My doctor said I was measuring 35 weeks at 30. She is sending me for an ultrasound but I can't imagine my daughter being that big already. What else could that mean? My health is good and my weight gain had been normal so I don't think its what I'm eating. Anyone else measuring big?",
