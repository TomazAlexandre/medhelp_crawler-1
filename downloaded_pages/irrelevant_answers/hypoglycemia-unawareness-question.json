            "answer": "Catherine, the ADA target for two hour post prandial is less 180.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone is different as the duration of humalog for you is probably different than my son.\u00a0\u00a0His is about 3 to 3.5 hours so at two hours would probably drop a little more.\u00a0\u00a0From the ADA website Humalog onset less than 15 minutes, peak .5 to 1.5 hours duration 2-4 hours and maximum duration 4-6 hours.\u00a0\u00a0And then throw the fat content of the food in the mix which slows digestion and we almost have to be a rocket scientist.Also from the www.diabetes.org website:\u00a0\u00a0\"Hypoglycemia unawareness tends to happen to people who have had diabetes for many years.\u00a0\u00a0Hypoglycemia unawareness does not happen to everyone.\u00a0\u00a0It is more likely in people who have neuropathy (nerve damage), people on tight glucose control, and people who take certain heart or high blood pressure medicines. As the years go by, many people continue to have symptoms of hypoglycemia,but the symptoms change.\u00a0\u00a0In this case, someone may not recognize a reaction because it feels different.\"I would say everyone is a little different here also.\u00a0\u00a0My son feels symptoms around 50 but does not get shaky until in the 30s.\u00a0\u00a0I worked with a lady who was shaky at 70.\u00a0\u00a0This may also depend on overall control.Just keep the communication lines open with your endo and diabetes educator who know you and your history.Have a great day.Carol",

            "answer": "Thank you JDRF-Team-CD for the informative reply...sometimes I think being a \"rocket scientist\" would be a piece of cake compared to what we go through day-to-day, even with most days being excellent.\u00a0\u00a0(I feel like my rocket has been to the moon too many times! LOL!!!)...I'm in very good control, good weight, perfect blood pressure & chol, just seem to have a lot of questions whenever I'm changing doctors or dosage.\u00a0\u00a0This endo is aggressive, and I just want to do as much research as possible.I will also refer to the ADA and diabetes.org websites you mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for providing such an important service!\u00a0\u00a0Websites are great, but getting \"real life\" feedback is even better!Catherine",

            "answer": "Hi again, HPC,Hypo awareness or unawareness seems to also be related to what our \"normal\" bgs are.\u00a0\u00a0By this mean that folks who walk around with daily BGs in the range of, say 200-300 will likely feel hypo if they drop to 150.\u00a0\u00a0Those who are targeting near normal bg levels of say 80-120, will often feel hypo at the numbers you report.There does seem to be another factor for many of us and that's the rate at which our bg is dropping.\u00a0\u00a0Drops caused by long acting insulin are gradual, much more subtle to detect, and might well be harder for most to recognize early on.\u00a0\u00a0Drops caused by short acting insulins typically trigger that \"adrenalin\" feeling that we associate with low bg.Two hours after eating is a common benchmark for peaks after meals, but there are so many variables.\u00a0\u00a0Peaks are tied, not only to the carb content but also the fat content of a meal/snack.\u00a0\u00a0More fat -- longer the interval 'til a peak.Altho' I'm not a physician, your doc's observation that 80-90 at 2 hours is low seems right to me.\u00a0\u00a0Why?\u00a0\u00a0Most short acting insulin still has some KICK left in it for 3-4 hours.\u00a0\u00a0If after 2 hours you're already at 80-90, it is almost certain you will drop below 70 if you don't take on more carbos.\u00a0\u00a0Well, that would be true for me ;-) and so I'd encourage you to relook at your insulin:carbo ratio.",

    "question": "Endo was noticing too many \"lows\" logged two hours after meal.\u00a0\u00a0She asked if I felt symptoms, and I said \"yes\".\u00a0\u00a0I have worked for 25 years in busy, high stress jobs, traveled, etc...always monitoring bg and adjusting glucose intake as needed.\u00a0\u00a0Have never in 39 years experienced a low so severe as to need medical attention, but of course, have had lows.\u00a0\u00a0I test 10 times/day.She said she just wanted to make sure, ..she did mention one thing that concerns me, and hopefully is a warning to those not sure.\u00a0\u00a0If you experience hypoglycemia unawareness, she said you could lose your drivers license.\u00a0\u00a0While I had always been aware of this condition, and hopefully watchful, this did shake me up a bit.Question I forgot to ask endo, and will definitely follow up on...at what point with levels are you supposed to \"feel\" symptoms?\u00a0\u00a070's?\u00a0\u00a060's?...I would say with me, it's anywhere around 70's and below.\u00a0\u00a0I can't say I feel much differenct from 110 down to a 80, for example.\u00a0\u00a0And my awareness, is often before it drops too low, but \"something\" doesn't feel right.\u00a0\u00a0But not severe shaking, sweats, etc., which I always experience at a very low level.\u00a0\u00a0Am I supposed to be shaky and confused at 70?Also, I'm confused on logging at two hours after a meal.\u00a0\u00a0Is this supposed to be our highest point, or should levels be settled after peak of Humalog at this point?\u00a0\u00a0I was thrilled with 2-hour logs of 80-90.\u00a0\u00a0She seemed to think these were low.After moving around the country, seeing over 8 endo's, I get a bit confused.\u00a0\u00a0(Yes, even after almost 40 years of this!)Thanks, Catherine",
