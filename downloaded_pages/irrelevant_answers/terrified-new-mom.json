            "answer": "Every state has different regulation and it may vary from hospital to hospital. It can also depend on your OB/midwife. What they do can very much depend on you yourself, if you got regular and early prenatal care, was cooperative and followed all your instructions;\u00a0\u00a0presented yourself as a caring and cared for mother to be, then there may not be any reason for them to test you. However if you or those around you send out warning signals with their presentation, dress or behavior, your health provider can very well test your baby's meconium (poop) without your consent. They can not test you without your express consent and knowledge.You should be aware that baby's meconium will show every drug the pregnant woman have used from the 20th week of pregnancy.But you\u00a0\u00a0should relax they do not just take babies away from their mothers unless there are major indicators for doing so. If you behave in a measured, reasonable manner, dress appropriately, show that you are taking care of yourself, thus of the baby, I'm sure everything will be fine.Please read read my blog on pregnancy and addiction by clicking on my name in blue and than \"blogs\". I do hope this pregnancy will have a very happy ending. Good luck and my best wishes.",

    "question": "I am currently almost 30 weeks & stopped smoking pot about a week ago. I was using it for anxiety because just last august I lost my daughter due to a still birth from hypertension & type 1 diabetes so I've been really scared that the same thing was going to happen this time. As I said I have quit for almost 2 weeks now but I've heard that ohio tests their fecal matter to see everything from week 16 and up. I just don't want to lose my son bc I was trying to keep calm to ensure his safety. If anyone has any advice or knows how ohio does things I need help please because now my anxiety is through the roof!!",
