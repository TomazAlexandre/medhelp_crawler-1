            "answer": "HiYou have a very good question here. Diabetes is a disease that targets almost all organs of the body as it typically involves the blood vessels. With diabetes the small calibered blood vessels are usually involved. This may lead to decreased blood supply in certain areas of the body such as the eyes, the skin and the extremities. You have observed that these skin patches or welts seem to appear when your blood sugar is uncontrolled. At this point, looking at the image, this appears to be\u00a0\u00a0a fungal infection. However, it only involves the palm (is this correct?).An infection and a vascular condition may be primary differentials here. It is important to keep a close check of your blood sugar levels. When was the last time you had your HgbA1C (hemoglobin A1C) monitored?",

            "answer": "Hello, I am going through the same issue right now. It makes me want to scream! Both of my hands are affected. It begins with the redness and itch. I try to ignore it, but it feels like a giant mosquito bite, If I itch, it feels relieved of the itch, in a way...but at the same time it then has a burning, bruising painful sensation, I am not diabetic. I recently found out I have thyroid nodules. I am going to a Doc in a few days, for a different issue, and pray she will have some answers or relief!",

    "question": "I have had prediabetes and insulent resistance since Nov. I have been walking 3-4 miles everyday and have lost 25 pounds. But...\u00a0\u00a0I am still getting these horrible red welts on the palms of my hands. When they form, they last for seven-eight days. They seem to form if I consume too much sugar... which, under normal conditions I avoid. The welts\u00a0\u00a0are painful, swollen, and they itch something awful. I use a Benadryl creme to cope.... as well as avoid sugar.I have not shown the welts to my physician. Are the welts telling me something serious\u00a0\u00a0about my health?",
