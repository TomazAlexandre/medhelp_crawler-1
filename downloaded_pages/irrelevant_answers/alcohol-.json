            "answer": "I am a big drinker and I've been living with diabetes for 10 years, most alcoholic drinks contains LOTS of sugar so it can shoot your blood sugar straight up but if you take enough doseage of insulin you won't vomit. Just with that, it's pretty difficult and not exactly sure how much to give.\u00a0\u00a0So I suggest if you're going to drink, drink tequila, that lowers your blood sugar and it's a diabetic's best choice of alcohol.",

            "answer": "I've been diabetic for 10 years and I am 28 years old. I was just stating to experiment with drinking when I was diagnosed. At first, I continued on drinking whatever and lots and found myself vomiting each and every time. I gave up drinking for a long time (5 years).Everyone is different. That being said it took me some time to determine what works for me and doesn't cause me to get ill. I personally can drink beer but I am sure to check levels often, have snacks on hand (since alcohol does naturally lower your blood sugar) and I only take half my nighttime insulin as I was often waking up with very low sugars in the middle of the night.My advice is to take it easy. I'm sure for you and your friends it's exciting and fun but always keep in mind you are (in the best way hehe) different from your friends and a little more fragile. Find what works for you and stick to it. Be sure to be in a safe environment when you're drinking. Confide in an adult you can trust so that you know there is someone to Come to the rescue should you drink something that doesn't work for you.Have fun & be safe",
