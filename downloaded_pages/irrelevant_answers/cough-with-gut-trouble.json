            "answer": "Hi and welcome to the GERD forumYes, it is possible for allergies and Post Nasal Drip to inflame GI issues.....and with the drainage you could also have a cough....You may want to see a Dr about allergies and or PND to see if that could in fact be your issue....When the GI track is in a flare most anything you eat will cause discomfort, even drinking water...so, see a Dr and get on meds to help calm it down so you can get back to eating more things again.",

    "question": "Does cough go with Gerd? I spit up clear phlegm and have a hacking cough!I had the cough all the way through Nov and December. Lung Dr. Said,\u00a0\u00a0Asthmatic Bronchitis.Now I'm wondering if this is from food allergy? I just ate a Avocado,and the nasty hacking is back.I've had gut trouble for 10 ys now. I have a lazy gut I'm also Diabetic. Diabetes from what I'm told can cause some major gut trouble. I have a failed spinal surgery syndrome since 2002 worn out hardware. Bad lumbar issues was told also it can really mess with your elimination process. I'm a mess. At any rate any of you experience the cough with Gerd?I feel so sore inside it feels like someone beat me up with a baseball bat!Thanks for any input...seems like I can't eat anything anymore without trouble :(((.",
