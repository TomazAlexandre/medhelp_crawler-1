            "answer": "Gestational diabetes doesn't have anything to do with the amount of sugar you eat. It is just something that happens to some ppl. I have had 2 gd free pregnancies and now with this 3rd one I have developed it. You should research it that way you can better understand what is going on with your body. Be sure that you follow the diet that they give you as the side effects of high blood sugar can adversely affect your baby. It can make your baby too big or in rare cases of uncontrolled blood sugar can cause death of baby in the last two months of gestation.",

            "answer": "The problem with your sugars might not be after you eat. It might be your fasting level (the 1st test right when you wake up before you eat anything). That's where my problem was. That means it has nothing to do with your diet. There is a medication called glyburide that can help. I would ask to be referred to a high risk specialist to discuss your options more thoroughly.",

            "answer": "Hello ladies. I plan on flowing the diet. And I've been testing how they want me to. My normal diet is already similar to a diabetic diet seeing how it runs in my family and I've been taking prevention steps (losing weight, cutting sweets, exercising) My issue is I can't eat as often as they would like me to. If\u00a0\u00a0try it turns my stomach but I eat three meals daily. (They want six) the doctor said to wait for the class to start my records but I started early to have a comparison. I am a licensed pharmacy tech so levels i get the dietis research i need. I get the importance of the disease. @Suprisedashell no I didn't eat before the one hour. I told them that before the test and was told it was ok. My level two sono is the 16th of December.\u00a0\u00a0It seems off that altering nothing I normally do and eat my sugar levels normal. Drinking major sugar would spike.",

Also said to monitor my blood levels and show the dr at my next visit.\u00a0\u00a0And to track what i eat they may revoke the diabetes procedures (two visits a week starting third trimester) if things are normal but advise me to stay way from the sweets. We'll see what happens but monitoring and all is the plan for now.",

    "question": "I went for the three hour glucose test yesterday because I failed the one hour. Sadly I failed the three hour too. Now there talking induction a week early. I keep telling them I don't eat sweets and the drink they gave me was more sugar than I have in a month!\u00a0\u00a0Honestly since my gallbladder was taken out two years ago sweets are hard for my stomach. Even more now that I'm pregnant. I've been testing after meals (my normal ones seeing how there is a class on the diet I have to attend) and all levels are coming back normal. (Nothing over 120). My due date of Feb 25 is really important to me (it's my grandmothers bday abd she passed two years ago)\u00a0\u00a0The doctor didn't seem to listen when I told them anything about my normal diet or what I wanted. They stapped a label on me and called it a day. I get its for the safety of my little one but could they be wrong about the results?",
