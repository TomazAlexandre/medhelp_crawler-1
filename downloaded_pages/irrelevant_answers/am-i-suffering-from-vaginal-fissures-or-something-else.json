    "question": "Am i suffering from vaginal fissures , I'm 19 years old and i havent been having complications sense i had unprotected sex with my bf.\u00a0\u00a0I have sex on dec 10 ( today is the 20). And a couple hours- til a day my vagina been hurting. Im not a sexually active person and i thought it was because i he was rough ( which he was) and he was pretty big. We did alot of sexual positions that I'm not use to and never really done. But i started to feel as if it was a cut ( papercut like) and my vagina lining feels as if it was teared or tearing. I got redness down there and it hurts when i pee. i get irration as well. Note that Iam a very unheatlhy person and i also have diabetes ( seening if my unhealthy lifestyle could of caused that).
