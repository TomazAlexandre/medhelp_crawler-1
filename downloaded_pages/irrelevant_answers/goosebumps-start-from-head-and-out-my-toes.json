            "answer": "Just out of curiosity...have you started menopause yet?These sound like typical symptoms of that.I'm only in peri-menopause...and I get these.However, it may be due to something else, so let's move on.Your Chest symtoms may be coming from Myofascial Trigger Points.Sometimes when your calcium/magnesium ratio is off, you can get twitching.Heart palpitations can also give you that feeling.Are you laying in a certain position when this happens?If so, it could be a pinched nerve...if not it could be a \"normal\" albeit odd response, to your body going into \"sleep mode\".Diabetes can cause \"body jumps\", so can menopause...there are so many possibilities.Perhaps you could keep a journal...write down the time of day these symptoms occur, what activities ( if any ) you were doing, what you had to eat, etc. After a week or two, look back in your journal to see if you can find any connection.Taking the journal to your doctor can help as well.",
