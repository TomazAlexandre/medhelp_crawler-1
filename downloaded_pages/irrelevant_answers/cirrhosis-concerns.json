    "question": "HelloFirst of all, I want to thank you for the wonderful work you do on this forum!Health historyI have had high cholesterol for about 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0Im 35 years old now. In 2010 I was having some stomach issues and lead me to see a GI doc.\u00a0\u00a0After endoscopy, full abdominal ultrasound and physical examination, nothing was found.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to watch my diet and limit my alcohol intake. Like a idiot that I'm I continue to eat bad and drink on weekends.\u00a0\u00a0Fast forward to 9/2013 I was out the country visiting family and since I had no medical insurance in the US I decided to get a complete physical which included endoscopy, ultrasound and liver function test, CBC and lipids.\u00a0\u00a0This time I was told I had chronic gastritis and a moderate fatty liver and high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0Spleen, Portal Vein, Pancreas, kindney's all seem to be normal.\u00a0\u00a0Again I was told to change my diet and cut back on alcohol. All my lab work associated with my liver has always been within normal range.\u00a0\u00a06 months later which was a month ago I started getting a discomfort (sort of pain) on my URQ which come and goes. Sometimes it feels superficial, sometime it feel and very spotty with like a 3 inch radius.\u00a0\u00a0It's never really my entire side.\u00a0\u00a0I been a binge drinker for at least 10 years and last couple of years I average about 24 beers per week. My father passed away from cirrhosis and was also a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0He started to drink 17 years prior to passing away when he was diagnosed with diabetes.My ques; are the following1) Could this pain be associated with cirrhosis with no other symptoms?2) I understand cirrhosis could be sneaky, but would any previous lab work have raised any red flags?3) Could I have advanced to cirrhosis from 6 months ago, with lab work within normal range and a fatty liver US?4) Does diabetes play a big roll on cirrhosis?\u00a0\u00a0I don't feel my father abused alcohol long enough to have developed cirrhosis. Could diabetes speed this process up?",
