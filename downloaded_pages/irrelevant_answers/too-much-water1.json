I still drink soda, eat candy.. Just not a lot and always followed by water.\u00a0\u00a0When I eat bread its 1slice, 1/2 roll, etc.. Potatoes 1/4cup to 1/2 cup with protein (chicken, steak) 4-6oz per meal. They say eat every few hours, my schedule makes that difficult. Walking after meals is helpful too.

Depending on where ur at, u could ask Dr to meet with a nutritionist to help u understand and set specific goals for you. Or if u are on or have access to wic they can help too. For me my goals are fasting level between 70-90, and 2hours after a meal 90-110. I am also on medication to help control mine now, however I wasn't when I had gd. l don't mind answering any ?
