            "answer": "Hi,How is your mom feeling?The TIA's are sudden onset of a focal and transient (< 24 hours) neurological deficit due to brain ischemia.Her signs and symptoms might be due to compromise of carotid circulation like monocular visual loss, hemiplegia, hemianesthesia, neglect, aphasia, visual field defects; less often headaches, seizures, amnesia, confusion.I think you should be admitting her for assessment as it appears there is carotid vessels compromise.You should be doing Duplex carotid Ultrasonography or cerebral angiography for further evaluation.I think it is the swelling which might be compromising his blood supply in Carotid artery while sleeping in night.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",

    "question": "Im not too familiar with this site but would like to post my moms symptoms and hope for a dr. to respond.My mom is 52 years old, she has had IDDM for about 8-10 years. Her sugars seem well controlled her bp is usually around 140-160 over 80-90. On tuesday night about 2300 she woke up feeling weak. She decided to stay in bed and wait, about two hours later she got up to go to the washroom and collapsed with paralysis in her legs, her speech was slurred. She immediatly called 9-1-1. Her sugar level at that time was 3.4. By the time she arrived at the ER, her symptoms had passed. The docs did an ECG and checked her troponin levels and all was well. They decided to send her home, I requested that they do a CT scan, but that showed nothing. They explained that it could be a TIA, but most likely due to low sugar. Then last night she had another episode, nothing nearly as severe, just some slight weakness on her right side, she was able to walk downstairs and smile in the mirror and all was ok, the symptoms passed shortly after. She is now on ASA. She has slightly high cholesterol(very slightly) and on Monday of this week she accidently doubled up on her insulin and had 80 units of 30/70 in the am. She was monitored that day closely. She also found a lump under her chin close to her carotid artery on the weekend. With all of this information, I am wondering if this seems she is having a problem with her sugars, TIA or a low flow TIA. It seems that this happens at night only and when she has been laying down for a longer period. We would like to prevent a stroke if possible, but unfortunarly due to her diabetes, the dr.s think thats all this is, but i am not so convinced. I would really appreciate some advise as to how to proceed or what you may think all of this may be. Is it a TIA??? Thank you so much",
