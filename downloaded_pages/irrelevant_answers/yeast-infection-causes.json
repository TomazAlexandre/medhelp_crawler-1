            "answer": "There are a lot of things that can cause yeast infections. I get them very easily. A couple of things that cause mine are: sitting and soaking in soapy bathtub water and\u00a0\u00a0prescription medications. In regards to getting an infection because of masterbation....it's not likely unless you do not properly clean what you use when done. My Dr. also recommends using a 7 day teatment as opposed to the 1 or 3 day treatment to prevent reoccurrance. Make sure to clean everything well (ie...clothing, bedsheets, bathtub, toilet) to prevent reoccurance. Also...stay away from sex during this time as it can be passed to your partner.Hope you feel better soon....I know how painful and frusterating they can be.",

            "answer": "To put it simply,\u00a0\u00a0just being alive can give you a yeast infection.Wearing tight pants (especially in hot muggy weather), nylon underwear, scented pads/tampons/personal sprays, sex, eating too much sugary foods, oral sex, washing yourself with soap of any kind, antibiotics, hanging around in a wet bathing suit, diabetes, stess and allowing yourself to get rundown.Basically it's just an overgrowth of yeast, which is a normal, frequent inhabitant of the vagina.\u00a0\u00a0 Do make sure to use the 7 day treatment.\u00a0\u00a0The 1 or 3 day treatments have a much higher concentration of med and can cause an alergic reaction or sensitivity.",

    "question": "Hey everyone. I just have a quick question that I really need an answer for. I am fairly certain that I have a yeast infection. I've got the burning sensation, the discharge, etc. But I don't know how I got it. Can masturbation lead to yeast infection? Thanks in advance.",
