            "answer": "I am not a physician, but the mom of a child with diabetes. I cannot give medical advice.I would suggest that you call your doctor and tell them that you cannot wait to be seen. You need to have him adjust your levels immediately. I would fax your numbers to your doctor and have them adjust your dosage, we do this with my daughter if she runs too high or too low between appointments. If the doctor will not do that I would have someone drive you to the ER or call 911 the next time it happens so that you can get the help you need. DO NOT DRIVE when you are feeling low.I would also suggest that you keep quick sugars handy along with some handy snacks, like cheese and crackers. Having those after the glucose will help to stabilize your levels.I hope this helps. Please let us know how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for your prompt reply and suggestion.I saw my doctor yesterday and she suggested I adjust short-acting insulin when I am experiencing lbs and check more frequently.Secondly, I attended Diabetes Education 10 years ago so I insisted I need a refresher and would like her to schedule me for one.\u00a0\u00a0I think being in the same room with other diabetics will help me understand my condition and will also allow me to share what I am going thru.Thanks again this forum has been helpful.",
