            "answer": "Thank you for responding Jennifer.\u00a0\u00a0It sure is nice to know someone out there is actually paying attention!!\u00a0\u00a0I thought the clotting and spotting probably were due to having sex, but still experiencing it 2 days later is what scared me.\u00a0\u00a0Congratulations on being 24w4d along, do you have any other children?\u00a0\u00a0This will be my first, so I'm really anxious about every little thing.\u00a0\u00a0It's frustrating to have everyone, from my husband to my parents to the doctors saying \"take it easy and just don't stress out\", how is that humanly possible in this situation.\u00a0\u00a0Every single thing I feel scares me, from the excrutiating gas I've been having to the pains in my side if I stretch or move too suddenly!!\u00a0\u00a0You have been a great help, it's nice to talk to someone else about all this, I think I call my mom everytime I feel like breaking down and crying and it's to the point where I just know she dreads me calling.\u00a0\u00a0I will try the expert forum, I guess it's on this site?\u00a0\u00a0I get caught up in reading all the posts and haven't really checked out the rest of this site!!\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry for your losses as well, how did you manage to pull yourself together after 2 m/c's?\u00a0\u00a0After I lost mine, I was just depressed and angry at the whole world.\u00a0\u00a0My diabetic OB/GYN made me make my own appointment for the D&C and never set me up with a doctor to talk with and kindof just forgot all about me!!\u00a0\u00a0I was fine for awhile, (I got pregnant in January of 06', we lost the baby towards the end of May) but once I got back to work, I started smoking again and trying to make my life as it was before.\u00a0\u00a0Around February of 07', I just all of a sudden lost it and couldn't do anything, I couldn't make myself get out of the bed, I didn't want to talk to family or friends, I missed so much work that my boss eventually had to let me go, hence losing my insurance.\u00a0\u00a0It has also been really hard to find help without health insurance as well.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I don't qualify for medicaid or any kind of assistance as he makes around $40,000/year gross salary, which of course is nowhere near what he brings home!!\u00a0\u00a0The government has treated us like criminals and it makes me sooooo mad, all the people I see who don't even try to work and make their lives better, get the whole world handed to them!!\u00a0\u00a0Finally, I found a great OB/GYN who is letting me make payments and has just been wonderful.\u00a0\u00a0It's still going to wind up costing us somewhere around $12,000.00 for everything, because of my diabetes and thats with a 40% discount which most of my doctors are offering for being self-pay.\u00a0\u00a0It's alot of money, but like I told my husband, it doesn't matter to me as long as we can have a healthy baby, the worst that can happen is we pay pregnancy bills for the next 30 years!!!\u00a0\u00a0HaHa!!!! (allthough I'm quite serious!!)\u00a0\u00a0Well sorry to rant and rave, hope I didn't make you sorry that you wrote to me!!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck with this pregnancy, I'll pray for you as well and thank you for taking the time to be a friend!!",

            "answer": "First off, let me congratulate you on your pregnancy!!!\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you are doing what you can to take care of yourself and get the prenatal help that is so important.I had many, many ultrasounds with both my pregnancies...high risk both times, so I can tell you what you might see at each week.\u00a0\u00a0At week 6 you should see a clump with a heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0Week 8 you will have a definition of the heart and a head, torso and arm/leg buds.\u00a0\u00a0From then on, the baby develops quite quickly.\u00a0\u00a0At around week 12, you can see pretty much all the stuff on the inside and determine if most everything \"looks\" ok.\u00a0\u00a0You can determine sex around week 17 or so (if it's a boy, it's definitely a boy), otherwise it might be what they think...we all start out looking like girls.\u00a0\u00a0They'll take measurements of the baby and of the womb to determine if everything is within the expected parameters for your timing.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully all will be as it should.There are certain tests they can run, but some of those tests can have pretty high false positives.\u00a0\u00a0That can add to your stress.\u00a0\u00a0We chose not to have any testing other than ultrasounds for that reason.\u00a0\u00a0We were going to handle whatever came along regardles.\u00a0\u00a0You need to think about that and whether or not you want any additional testing.\u00a0\u00a0It also will be your responsibility to pay for that since you aren't covered by health insurance.\u00a0\u00a0Let me also say, I agree with you on the medicaid thing.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry you are in such a spot, but you seem to be handling as best as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Good for you!Take a videotape along, some docs will tape the session for you.I know it's useless to say this, but try not to worry about the \"what ifs\".\u00a0\u00a0You've been given a wonderful gift, you seem to want this child very much.\u00a0\u00a0It's in God's hands what will happen.\u00a0\u00a0You have to trust that it will work out in some way.Rant and rave all you need, it's a wonderful/stressful time.\u00a0\u00a0Drink lots of water, walk when you can, take your vitamins (take a B complex one for extra energy), rest, drink water (did I say that????), eat well but not for two!\u00a0\u00a0:)Good luck on the rest of your pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you have a beautiful baby, healthy and screaming it's head off!!!!\u00a0\u00a0:)Lisa",

    "question": "Please, somebody answer this question.\u00a0\u00a0I have been all over the web, on various pregnancy sites and no one will respond to my questions.\u00a0\u00a0I am a type 2 diabetic and I am 36.\u00a0\u00a0I lost a baby at 22 weeks last year due to no ambiotic fluid resulting in genetic abnormalties (no kidneys, lungs and severely underdeveloped heart), I had to have a D&C done, which just about killed me mentally.\u00a0\u00a0I am now somewhere between 11 and 14 weeks pregnant again (I go for an ultrasound this Friday 1/18/2008).\u00a0\u00a0I had absolutely no control of my diabetes when I conceived (blood sugars were running high 200's to 300's) this was due to losing my job and health benefits and I couldn't afford my medications.\u00a0\u00a0I was given an A1C test but do not have the exact number result, but probably around 11.\u00a0\u00a0I am so concerned that this baby won't make it either or that it will have awful deformities.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on insulin as soon as I found out I was pregnant (at about 8-11 weeks) and have had very good control since then.\u00a0\u00a0I am so scared, last tuesday (1-8-2008) I had some spotting and made an emergency visit to my OB/GYN where I got yelled at for my high A1C test results and was told there was a good chance of a miscarriage, but the doctor heard a heartbeat and said he was very happy about how strong it was.\u00a0\u00a0This past Saturday (1/13/2008) my husband and I had sex and after I passed 2 clots, about nickel sized and have been lightly bleeding (just when I wipe) since then and also some brownish, slimy discharge.\u00a0\u00a0Like I said, I go for my first ultrasound on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0Will they be able to see if the major organs are developed and will they be able to tell if the ambiotic fluid levels are o.k.?\u00a0\u00a0Did the sex cause the bleeding and discharge (I've heard that can happen)?\u00a0\u00a0Too may questions to post here, I could go on all day.\u00a0\u00a0Basically, I just want to know if there is even the slightest chance of having a healthy baby in this situation or am I just building up false hope?\u00a0\u00a0Please somebody respond, I really need some advice and someone to talk to.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you and good luck to all the pregnant ladies!!!",
