            "answer": "Hi,Diabetes should definitely be ruled out by getting a blood sugar done and the other possibility I was thinking was something known as Hypertrophic Pyloric stenosis in which the terminal part of the stomach gets quite narrowed and tight and doesn\u2019t allow the contents to go to the intestine. I think you should consult a pediatrician. Make sure you are adequately burping the child as it is the most common cause of the vomiting in the child.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted.Kind regards.",

    "question": "My 19month old has been having vomiting spells for about two months now and i don't know why. It usually only takes place at night after he drinks something. At first i thought maybe he was drinking too much and maybe too fast but even drinking half a cup slowly makes him have projectile vomiting spells. Then i thought well maybe it was a milk allergy cause that is what he always drinks when it happens but even after cutting out the milk he still has issues with anything he drinks even water. We can not find an explanation for this am i am worried. Especially because he drinks alot and urinates alot. Can a child this young have type 1 diabetes or any suggestion to what might be going on?",
