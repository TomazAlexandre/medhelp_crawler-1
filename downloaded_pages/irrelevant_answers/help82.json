            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry for replaying late!\u00a0\u00a0I can understand your worries since now bladder issues have cropped up.The first thing to be done is to stop playing football until a doctor has been consulted. A pinched nerve in lower back should be investigated first. An X-ray of lower spine, a MRI and nerve conduction study may be required.If lumbar and sacral spinal nerves are involved then you can have tingling, numbness, pain in the limb and bladder and bowel issues. In addition the pudendal nerve may be trapped. This can be detected by nerve conduction studies.Another possibility is that the bladder issues are due to urinary infection or prostatitis. So this aspect should be looked into.High blood sugar, thyroid issues, electrolyte imbalance and autoimmune disorders like lupus can cause peripheral neuropathy resulting in numbness, tingling etc. Diabetes can cause increased risk of bladder infection. So, if there are no pinched nerves then these conditions should be looked into.If all these are ruled out then yes, ALS and MS should be looked into.Since no weakness is probably detected on left side, you probably have perceived weakness. A clinical examination and nerve conduction study may be required to find out if there is true or perceived weakness.A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please consult your doctor (a neurologist and a GP) regarding this. Take care!I sincerely hope you will find this information useful. Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",
