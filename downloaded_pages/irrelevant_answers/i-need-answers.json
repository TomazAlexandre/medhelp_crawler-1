            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!In a teenage boy, high alkaline phosphatase is expected, but should not be overtly high. There are several bone disorders too that can raise this enzyme like rickets, osteomalacia, Paget\u2019s disease of the bone, tumors, metastasis and recent fracture. An elevation in AP is often seen in cholestatic liver disease, bone disease, and occasionally with inflammatory bowel disease. In an otherwise healthy individual a raised AP could be due to false positive test and the test should be repeated. If it is still high then other mentioned causes should be ruled out, especially IBS and liver problems (through a liver function test and ultrasound as he complains of right side stomach pain)Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "My son is 17 years old and has been complaining of dizzy spells for the last 4 months. He says he gets real dizzy upon standing and his eyesight is blurry and there is a like a black circle around everything. This condition is getting worse. We have had an echocardiogram and that was fine. His lab was also OK expect his alkaine phosphatase were elevated. He complains of leg and arm pain, like they are brusied. (Says it hurts to touch). We had a MRI done today and will have the results in a couple of days. He also has sharp pains in his stomach more so on the right side. He is healthy plays soccer and is a very active young adult. I am worried about him. If you have ideas please let me know. Thank-you.",
