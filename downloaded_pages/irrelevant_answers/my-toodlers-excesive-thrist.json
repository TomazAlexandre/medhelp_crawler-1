            "answer": "That seems like an awful lot. Thats 3 quarts. Most adults are supposed to drink 2 quarts a day. If he was taking something like a decongestant, that could cause a lot of thirst. If the thirst continues, I would suggest having him tested for \"Diabetes Insipidus\". This is not actually a form of sugar diabetes. It just has diabetes in its name because the symptoms resemble diabetes. Here is a link.http://www.diabetesinsipidus.org/whatisdi.htmIn any case, if he says he is thirsty, then let him drink as much water or milk as he wants. Definately keep watering down his juice. Put in as little juice as he'll let you get away with. Count how many wet diapers he has per day, note the size, and just how wet they are. Keep this information for his Dr. Diabetes Insipidus is diagnoses by urine tests, MRI, and a water deprivation test (under controlled circumstances).",

    "question": "I have a 2 1/2 year oldson, and for the past 2 months a have been seeing specialists for apparently some allergy to milk. But right now my consern is an excesive juice and water drinking. He asks me for liquid all the time and the doctors performed sugar test and they came out ok.

Today, a put everything togheter and I am worried.What can you tell me.Thank you",
