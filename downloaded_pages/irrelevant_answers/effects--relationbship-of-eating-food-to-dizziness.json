            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!If you have diabetes then sugar containing food can cause dizziness. Gluten allergy can cause dizziness on taking gluten rich food. People with high blood pressure get dizziness on taking high fat food. Food allergies and sensitivities too cause dizziness. Low blood sugar as in some diseases and on missing meals, too cause this. In fact severe anorexic states are responsible for dizziness. It is also possible due to severe acidity or acid reflux.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
