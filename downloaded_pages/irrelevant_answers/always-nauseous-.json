    "question": "Lately (past week or so) I have been feeling very nauseous. Wether I eat or don't eat I always feel that way. It's gotten to the point where I don't even want to eat anymore because it's a little bit more tolerable if I don't eat. It's even gotten to the point where I've had to leave work because I've felt so sick. I feel perfectly normal in everyway except being nauseous.Any ideas on why this could be? Thanks!",
