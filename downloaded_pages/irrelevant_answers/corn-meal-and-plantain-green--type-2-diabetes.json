            "answer": "Hi,I will start by asking you a question.\u00a0\u00a0How is your blood sugar control?\u00a0\u00a0Are you able to keep your blood sugars consistently in the range of 70 - 120 (3.9 - 6.7)?If you can keep your blood sugars in this range then your diet is fine.\u00a0\u00a0If your levels are much higher, then you will either need medications or to change your diet, or both.Both plantains and cornmeal are very high\u00a0\u00a0in carbs.\u00a0\u00a0In diabetes, carbs are no longer able to processed properly, so eating a diet lower in carbs will help with control.Lower carb foods will include meat, non-sweetened dairy (cheese, yoghurt, butter, cream), eggs, nuts, and non-starchy vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortuantely fruits and grains are very high in carbs, and may need to be limited by many.Hope this helps you. Please ask more questions if you need.",
