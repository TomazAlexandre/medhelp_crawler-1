    "question": "Last September I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I started taking Glipizide 5mg in the am along with meds for blood pressure. I also made major life style changes. I exercise an hour a day five days a week now. I eat extremely heathy. I lost 30 lbs. I'm sleeping again. I changed jobs. I'm still very overweight, but all my numbers are now in the normal range or close to it. I am wondering if the improvement in my numbers (ie blood glucose, blood pressure, cholesterol) are due to the meds or the life style changes that I have made?",
