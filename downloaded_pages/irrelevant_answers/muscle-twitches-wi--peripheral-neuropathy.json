            "answer": "Hi both - I too have had all over body twitches, together with ongoing leg and bone pains and foot pain/numbness.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 38 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I was once told that if you can't see the twitches - this is usually related to anxiety (yes, I know you both have probably heard of this word, alot!), but if you can actually see the twitches, this could be nerve/muscle related.\u00a0\u00a0My twiches are quite noticeable, especially in my legs, left arm and both feet, but a nerve conductor I had done a year ago, ruled out nerve damage - so as Missile mentions, I too have just gotten used to them.\u00a0\u00a0My leg/bone pain is what ails me the most at this time in my life.\u00a0\u00a0I just take it a day at a time, as I am sure, if we are about to land up with any muscular illness, our bodies will give us fair warning.\u00a0\u00a0Take care the both of you.",

            "answer": "Thanks to both of you.\u00a0\u00a0I have not heard that the twitches you cannot see are anxiety related so that helps a bit.\u00a0\u00a0I was just concerned that the twitches that are constant in my foot are a bad sign because I had heard that twitches constant in one location are more related to MND.\u00a0\u00a0But, I then happened upon the Peripheral Neuropahthy info that says that it is normal to get the twitches in the affected areas and my left foot is definately the most affected area.\u00a0\u00a0Oh well, I guess each day without any more bad symptoms such as weakness, etc. is a good sign.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping that by now (2 months later) I would have some other major symptoms!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again.Missile",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Your symptoms certainly seem to be due to peripheral neuropathy due to B12 deficiency, also since they have improved after B12 injections.Have you been tested for diabetes?Diabetes can also cause peripheral neuropathy also and should be ruled out. At the moment the possibility of ALS or MND does not seem very likely.I would suggest you to continue with your medications and watch for few more days. If the symptoms still persist please consult a neurologist.",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 39 (almost 40) year old female.\u00a0\u00a0I have had all over muscle twitches on and off for years, and have really just gotten used to them.\u00a0\u00a0However, about 2 months ago, along with having them all over my body, my left foot started to contantly twitch.\u00a0\u00a0These twitches are a little different.\u00a0\u00a0They are more quicker and more like \"pops\" sometimes, in addition to twitches.\u00a0\u00a0I was really worried about ALS or something, although I have no weakness anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing I can think of is that I found out around that time that I have a B12 deficiency (202).\u00a0\u00a0I have since began injections.\u00a0\u00a0I did notice that I was having some numbness in my toes in that foot, along with sharp pains in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0From alot of research, I have I think come to the conclusion that I may have PN from the B12 def.\u00a0\u00a0The pains are much better except I do notice them when I wake up and start to walk.\u00a0\u00a0But the twitches in my left foot are still constant.\u00a0\u00a0Is this anything anyone else has experienced?\u00a0\u00a0I am really trying not to worry about a MND, but it is hard with all the twitching.\u00a0\u00a0I guess from what I've read, by now I would have at least SOME weakness and I do not.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know what you think.Thanks!!Missile",
