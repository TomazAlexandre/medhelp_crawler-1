            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The pain you experienced could be renal colic. Another cause for the pain is the kidneys are likely to be infected resulting in Pyelonephritis, as with your history of chronic bladder infections, this can spread up and affect the kidneys. Also, diabetes may have to be ruled out.Now when you meet your doctor the following tests may need to be done. 1. Assess the kidney function, this is done by a blood urea and creatinine and sometimes a GFR (glomerular filteration rate). 2. Assess the kidney structure, with an ultrasonogram, an IVP (intravenous pyelogram), here a dye is injected to study the kidneys. 3. Determine the status of your bladder infection, with a culture and sensitivity of the urine, to initiate the right antibiotic. 3. Blood tests like Hemoglobin for anemia, hematocrit, serum albumin, calcium phosphorus and parathyroid hormone levels, these tests are done to determine the systemic effects of kidney function. 4. Invasive procedures like cystoscopy can identify lesions in the bladder. 5. For diabetes, a fasting and post prandial blood sugars, if these test are borderline may ask for a glucose tolerance test.So, Please have yourself evaluated at the earliest and any further queries will be glad to clarify.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
