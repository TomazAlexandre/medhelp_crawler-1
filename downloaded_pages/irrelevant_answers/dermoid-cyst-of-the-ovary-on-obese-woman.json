            "answer": "I am not of your weight, but I did look up surgery risk for obese. It said the main risk is heart. Do you already have any heart conditions you are taking medication for? I would consult a cardiologist if so before the surgery. The other main risk would be nerve damage ( I don,t know about that, it wasn.t the main risk. I had two surgeries in two years. It probably is going to depend on your job, sitting or standing,etc. I feel it will take at least six weeks, the first 2 or 3 are the worst. Who is doing the surgery? A gyn or general surgeon? You might post dr. goodman on the dr forum. It is on the right hand side of the forum page instead of the left.\u00a0\u00a0Donna",

    "question": "I had CT Scan & Transvag ultasound revealing a 8.5 x 6.5 dermoid cyst.\u00a0\u00a0I am obese (350 pounds).\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said it was a risky surgery because of my weight and the size of the mass.\u00a0\u00a0They recommended a hysterectomy, not just removal of the mass.\u00a0\u00a0I am 46 and do not intend to have more children.Has anyone had a similar experience?\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned about the pain returning (it sent me to the ER two nights ago and that was when I had all the tests).\u00a0\u00a0I'm also concerned about being out of work for 6-8 weeks for recovery.What is the recovery like for an open surgery of this nature in an obese woman?ThanksMorrowville",
