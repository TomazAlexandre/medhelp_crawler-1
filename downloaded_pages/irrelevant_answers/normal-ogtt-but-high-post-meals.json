            "answer": "I no longer eat a lot of bad carbs, except certain occasions I may have a bad meal. That's when I will check. Now I eat a lot of Chicken breast, lean turkey, fish, veggies, sweet potatoes, barley, legumes, steel cut oats, and good fats like olive oil and natural peanut butter. I also train a lot at the gym. Just curious as to why bad carb foods seem to spike me higher than a OGTT, or liquid carb load like normal Coke does. Dr seems to thinks its from stressing from sticking myself. Sticking rarely hurts, but I guess its a mental thing. It freaks me out. Thanks for the reply.",

    "question": "Hi, question. Diabetes is in my family. So I've become a bit more careful with diet and exercise. I got a meter for periodic checks. I always fast around 73-78. Yet after carby meal(pizza, burgers and fries), I tend to go up between 140-180. I HATE sticking my finger, and get worked up thinking about doing it at 2 hours. I'm sure sticking myself effects me, as if I stick myself then check 3 times in a row I see a steady rise. Anyway. I saw the Dr. I had normal fasting, and a A1C of 5.5. After pushing some, I got a glucose tolerance test. At 1 hour I tested at 118. At 2 hours I was at 98. This is confusing. I tested again after a carby meal, was 161 at 2 hours. So curious, upon waking one day, I drank a 20oz coke with slightly less carbs given in a glucose test(I think 65). I checked, and sure enough, had similar normal readings like in the glucose tolerance test. My Dr. Said its likely just because I stress about testing, its effecting food digestion, and the stress hormones are raising blood sugars more when I'm trying to digest a carb load. He seems to think that since my body handled the liquid carb load in both the glucose test he gave me, and the 20oz coke I drank, that I am fine. He said when I'm not stressing out and testing, I am likely in normal level. I did test spur of the moment one day after lunch. I ate a box of fries and a cheesesteak, and 1 hour and 45 minutes later, I had a reading of 99. My Dr. Suggested I stop stressing and testing or I will cause issues. He said just test my fasting every 3-6 months. And if I wanna check postprandial, try with a coke again.Does this sound normal? Can freaking out and stressing cause a post meal spike in a nondiabetic? Just curious and hope to put my mind at ease. Thanks.P.S.I don't eat junk anymore. I'm now strictly on healthy diet such as chicken breast, fish, sweet potatoes, barley, steel cut oats, and so on.",
