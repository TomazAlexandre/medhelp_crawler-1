            "answer": "Hi and welcome,There are various medical explanations for what you have mentioned.........from what i understand, what your basically saying is that your neurologist is believes the type of incontinence you experience is common (possible more suggestive of stress incontinence), and the other symptoms are related to your weight, right?Is it possible that your weight is actually causing you these problems if it's being mentioned, depending on how much extra weight you have, then pre-diabetes or diabetes, vascular issues and the additional stress on your joints, spine etc wouldn't be an unreasonable explanation for someone who is over weight, also peripheral neuropathy is associated with weight too.Same could also apply with incontinence, it depends on type of incontinence but extra weight can also cause bladder and bowel issues, it;s different than neurologically caused because the nerves and organs are undamaged but the added fat surrounds the organs and the outer layers add pressure etc.I don't know if your weight could be enough to be a possible factor but If your weight is being blamed is it possible that it is a bigger problem than you were aware of and worth finding out, if its a valid alternative and a potential solution there.Cheers.......JJ",

            "answer": "According to online weight calculators 5ft x 16st (224 pounds)\u00a0\u00a0and gives you a body mass index of 43.7, the recommended weight for your height is 95-128 pounds and a BMI of 18.5-24.9\u00a0\u00a0so your weight for your height does put you into the obese category's and all the associated medical issues then wouldn't be unlikely eg pre-diabetes, diabetes, coronary issues, vascular, peripheral neuropathy etc etcIt's understandable to worry but it is much more likely that your weight is the common cause of these issues, than something less common is being missed with the focus being on your weight. Try if you can to turn your concerns into empowering you whilst your working on your weight issue and turn what your dealing with into your reason to continue fighting when the day's get tough......Cheers.........JJps medhelp does have some good diet related support groups you may be interested in checking out :D",

    "question": "Hi was wondering if anyone has experienced these symptoms , as doctors making me feel I'm going mad\u00a0\u00a0. About 4 months go my right leg became achy and weak more so in the morning and wen I was walking , also felt tight against my pants . When I rested I would he burning sensations and cramps and had to lavate my left to ease the symptoms , LSO my bladder and bowls have been weak for over a year , I no I need the loo but is carnt seem to hold it in , upon all this I went to the er who sent me for a MRI on my spine witch came back as recess narrowing o the lower discs but no nerve comprestion , and degenerative water and tear ( they called it ) also a slight tear that will repair its self . So doctor said go for walks up hills and loose weight\u00a0\u00a0, the problem is I cent walk very far with my leg\u00a0\u00a0and they don't think any of these are the cause , so the seen me to have xrays on my knees witch said wear and tear in my knees but worse in my right knee , doctors comment was we all get wear and tear . Still frustrated as m mobility has worsened went ba k and demanded to see a neurologist . Upon my appointment with the neuro he said there is weakness but I think for not trying in case you hurt your back ( very anger at this point) I said no your wrong it is weak and said he thinks its my weight and the incontinence I due to having a 8lb baby 16 years ago , but agreed to send me for a MRI on brain and cervic . Since then I've been getting headaches in left side of head and tingling and numbness in fingers please help any comments would be helpful . Feel like thy think I'm faking , I'm 34 female thanks .x",
