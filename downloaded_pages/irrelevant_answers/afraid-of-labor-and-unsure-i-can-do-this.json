I'm angry that I'm putting this in my body which can hurt my baby, all because I can't pull myself together and act like an adult. It's not really having any positive or negative effect so far. Thanks though. I guess there are no real solutions other than patience, exercise and in my case, prayer. Thanks for letting me vent, it helps!",

            "answer": "I think most of us have been in your position. Pregnancy depression is very common. There really isn't much you can do but talk to your Dr and be honest about how your feeling. Maybe once you get a chance to let it out and talk to someone who can relate will help a little. And just stay as healthy as possible. Keep telling yourself this isn't a forever thing. That baby will get out sooner than later. Is it possible to take time from work? Or maybe you can treat yourself to a pedicure or prenatal massage. Take the necessary time to yourself and relax mama. It will get better and it will be over soon. Good luck praying for some relief ;-)",

    "question": "I'm 33 years old and 27 weeks along with my first child. I'm miserable and have no idea how I'm going to make it another 90 days. I've just almost overnight blown up and feel like a whale and I despise having to find something to wear and go face the world each day. I'm beginning to feel like a circus act at work as people act like I'm the first pregnant lady they have ever seen.I've gone from a cute, size 4 to a 12-14. I've already gained 29 pounds and I'm beginning to lose myself I'm so depressed. It's like I want to either punch someone or cry all the time with no break.Well today I lost it and actually drank 3 beers over a course of 4 hours by myself crying the entire time. I don't know how I am going to make it mentally and physically for 3 more months. My husband is constantly pointing out how long it's been since we've had sex and that makes me feel worse because lately I jerk away whenever he even tries to hug me and the thought of anything intimate just makes me want to climb out of my skin!What is WRONG with me?? Whenever I try to talk to my mom she just takes his side on everythingaand makes me feel guilty because \"she just LOVED being pregnant\" and I should stop being so selfish.Am I not cut out for this?? I don't feel that bond that I thought every woman did. If anything, I have to stop myself from being angry at an unborn baby who I'm supposed to love and nurture for \"making\" me feel this way. I just feel so suffocated, fat, scared and want to feel like myself again and I'm scared that I will never come back.Any advice or suggestions? Please don't harp about the beer. At the time, I needed to chill because I was losing it. Not a regular thing by any means..",
