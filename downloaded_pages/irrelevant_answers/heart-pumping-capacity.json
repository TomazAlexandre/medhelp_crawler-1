            "answer": "Whether pumping capacity can be increased depends on the underlying cause.\u00a0\u00a0If the cause is due to ischemia (lack of blood flow to the heart cells), high blood pressure, or other condition that stress and over work the heart, therapy that corrects the condition can cause the heart to return to normal functionality.If the low cardiac output is due to heart muscle damage from a previous heart attack,\u00a0\u00a0some medication, drugs, alcohol virus, bacterium, etc., heart contractions may not improve very much.\u00a0\u00a0High blood pressure can cause the heart to enlarge due to additional workload of pumping against high resistance, and that can reduce contractility.\u00a0\u00a0With BP under control, the heart may return to normal.Five years ago my ventricle pumping capacity was 13-29%.\u00a0\u00a0Currently my heart functions normally, but it appears the enlarged left ventricle has caused mitral valve leakage.",

            "answer": "My father had an open heart surgery (four bypass) ten years ago in the US, he is now 63, on a check-up, the doctor (Pakistan) informed him that his heart has enlarged and is pumping at a rate of 20-25%.My father has been taking regular medications since the surgery as prescribed by the doctors. His blood pressure is normal (140-150/90).What would be the best treatment for his condition?",

            "answer": "They obviously did an echoscan to establish the heart output, so they should mention if they noticed any scar tissue from previous MI. I assume the bypass surgery was a success but perhaps not all the tissue fully recovered. If he has new symptoms, perhaps the arteries are blocking again causing the problem. Further testing is definitely required but he should be on medication to help with the low EF, such as beta blockers.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately, your father's blood pressure is in the range of being high.\u00a0\u00a0A strong pumping heart would not find the resistence of given blood pressure enough to cause an increase in the left ventricle pumps against, but a lower than normal pumping capacity may stress the heart to enlarge and the enlargement can/will reduce EF.As ed states there may have been a prior heart attack that has impaired the heart wall movement, and that could reduce the pumping strength. Your quote:... \"heart problem one month before this problem starts\"... it is not clear what your father's problem is other than high bp and low EF.Please what was your father's\u00a0\u00a0heart condition prior to bypass?;\u00a0\u00a0it appears you are concerned about a recent exam that revealed an enlarge heart and high blood pressure!? ...and for the last 10 years there were no problems!Treatment would be medication to control blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Medication can also be digoxin to increase the force of the contractions of the muscle of the heart by inhibiting the activity of a relevant enzyme. Under some circumstances diet and aerobic can increase the heart's pumping contractions as well..",

His pumping level is 25%. He is taking medicines for past 12months. But, no improvement still. Doctors suggesting to go for a surgery for fitting pacemakers. But, we are very confused. He is just 30yrs old. Can we improve it with medicines?\u00a0\u00a0Is surgery necessary.. Pls advice!! It would be really great help..Thankssandhya.ThanksSandhya.",
