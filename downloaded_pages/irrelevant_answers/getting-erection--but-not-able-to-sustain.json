    "question": "Hi,I am a 31 year old male from India. I am unmarried and working as a software engineer. I am planning to get married soon.The problem I am facing is I am not getting sustained erection. Erection is not lasting more than one minute.Few months back a considerable reduction of sperm count was detected and I was treated for Vericocele. Same time I got circumcised too because of Phimosis.Now, even after 5 months of surgery, I am still feeling a slight pain in one of my left testicle.Also, I am feeling severe pain just above my left buttock. Pain is maximum when I wake up in the morning and use a soft bed.When I asked my urology surgeon about by erection problem, he did some hormone and diabetes test and told me its all because of my anxiety, not because of any physical health issue. I have tried to have sex with my girl friend multiple times, but all failed because of not getting proper erection and pre-mature ejaculation.I also used to get strong erection in early morning (without my knowledge), but that is not happening nowadays. Somebody told me that this is a sign pf erectile dysfunction due to physical problem. Also I get wet dreams if I stop masturbating for more than 1 week.Please advice me on this issue, please help me to regain my love and life.Thank you",
