            "answer": "The first thing to do is to politely ask her physician if he would consider other protocols than coumadin. Among other problems is it often very difficult to maintain consistent levels. I have discussed coumadin in other posts. The physician has to suggest coumadin, because that is the current \"standard of care\". If the PATIENT pops the question, he can then discuss other alternatives (they are there), which do not provide as much anti-coagulent action, but permit a normal diet. I would go into the food list, however there are pages of this on the internet. For the phelobotomist not to know everything about the diet this suggests you find another phlebotomist. My question is why is the patient on cuomadin. Sometimes, if you have certain conditions you MUST have coumadin. Certain heart valve replacements, for example. Other conditions permit a great deal of lee-way. In general, if you have a specific question about a specific drug interaction with a specific food, get the PDR, locate the manufacturer of the drug, and e-mail or telephone them. I have the answer, but I'm not going to give it because when you fool with drugs you need definitive advice from the company that manufactures the drug.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!First of all I must know the disorder for which your client is taking Coumadin. What are the other medications that your client is taking? Certain medications interact with Coumadin making more free drug available or lesser drug available. Also certain diseases like kidney problems, diabetes, thyroid problems, congestive hear failure or liver problems interfere with the metabolism of the drug, thus the levels fluctuate. The doctor needs to take all this into consideration while adjusting the dose.Diet is the next thing that comes into the picture. The client needs to avoid VitK rich food. Yes, cauliflower is one of them.\u00a0\u00a0For other food items you can see read this link: http://www.fcs.uga.edu/ext/pubs/fdns/FDNS-E-89-33.pdfIt is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
