            "answer": "You can def talk to them about having a scheduled induction before baby gets too big. I also have GD and am facing the same fears since I have big babies anyways :( but I'm talking to my doc today about scheduling an induction date but because my husband works in the prison system and may miss the birth of our baby if we can't get a set date ...try not to stress and just have a firm talk with your doc and tell them this is your birth plan and its what you really want",

    "question": "I was told I have gestational diabetes at 26/27 weeks. I am now almost 33 weeks and was told last week that my baby is estimated at 5lbs already. I feel like that's huge. All the doctor kept talking about was my chances of having a c-section if he gets too big. I do not want a c-section at all, it's been my biggest fear the closer I get to my due date. Just curious on what you ladies think I should do. Bring up induction in my check up today or just go with the flow?",
