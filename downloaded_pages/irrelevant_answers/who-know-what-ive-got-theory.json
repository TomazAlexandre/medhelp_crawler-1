            "answer": "My father has suffered with many strokes and before that had several TIA. He has type 2 Diabetes and very high cholesterol. My father also had to have one of his carotid arteries \"cleaned out\" due to it closing mostly off with plaque.I would make sure that your bad cholesterol levels are in check. I would also get your carotid artery evaluated. Did they do a diagnostic test on your left carotid artery to see how much stenosis there is % wise flowing through? A baby aspirin is a good blood thinner but they may eventually put you on something stronger. Do make sure your Diabetes stays in check also.TIA are warnings of strokes. My father has 3 strokes that have hit his speech center of his brain among other things. He has recovered but this last one messed up his thought process as well. He wants to say a word but can't recall the word.How long did the episode last that you had?Take care",

            "answer": "well , for some reason today I am better I decided to drive myself to the doctor and endo crinologist say blood work is ok and carotid doppler came back ok. My gp thinks maybe I should change my neuro .\u00a0\u00a0 For some reason neurologist increase my zonasmide to 200mg before bedtime. I have had a great 24 hours Sometime I think forget all of this neurologist want me to wear eeg monitor for a day or two and if that negative maybe have a spinal tap.. I think my neck is more of the culprit because when I try to read menu or turn to my right I feel like I have a sheild on my right eye or something its a strange feeling. the back of my scalp feels like its tightening or something I was worried it might be ms just because I thought of everything else. I am tired of worrying about want to feel normal again today was pretty close I hope I have another day tomorrow like today . Who now if this was some kind of firal that effective spinal cord my back sure has been sore\u00a0\u00a0but in odd places.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I new what to do about the neurologist",

            "answer": "Why does your GP want you to change neuros?The blurriness in your right eye and odd sensation you're having are troublesome symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I'd see an opthamologist ASAP.\u00a0\u00a0Optic neuritis, is common in people with MS.\u00a0\u00a0Some people lose their vision because of it, so it's not anything to mess with.Please tell us more about what kinds of tests that your neuro has ordered.\u00a0\u00a0MS is diagnosed after ruling out many, many other problems and diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had blood tests to rule out other problems/diseases?The spinal tap may help with trying to figure out what's going on.Having lesions on your brain and the symptoms you have, needs to be investigated thoroughly.\u00a0\u00a0Did you have your MRI with and without contrast?I have no idea why your GP is thinking to see a different neuro or your opinion of your current neuro, however, there's some great neuros in the Houston area.Deb",
