            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There are two major possibilities. Either your liver function is not too good or you have a gastric ulcer. Get a liver function, kidney function test, test for hypothyroidism and diabetes. These will rule out the general causes for loss of appetite. It could be that you are depressed or anxious. Energy drinks etc also if consumed decrease the appetite.For gastric function, try OTC omeprazole with antacids. Keep a diet chart and note your food intake\u00a0\u00a0in that.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Recently I have lost my appetite. I am hungry but when it comes to actually eating something the thought of food makes me nauseous. If I force myself to eat I am sick and anything I do eat tastes odd. Can anyone spread any light on what might be up?It has happened before quite regularly, lasting a few days every couple of months and varies in its severity. I can't see any links with my lifestyle etc so I'm stumped. Anyone know what it is? Is it common? Should I be changing my diet?",
