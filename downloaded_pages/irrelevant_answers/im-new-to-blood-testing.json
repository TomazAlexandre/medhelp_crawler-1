            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.You will notice your blood sugar fluctuates during the day. It will go up after eating (especially if you eat a meal high in carbohydrates), it will go down after physical activity or exercise. The goal is to keep the fluctuation within the \"normal\" blood glucose parameters (65-120).For people who don't have diabetes, their body responds to these fluctuations by excreting insulin when the level becomes elevated. For diabetics, their body does not respond to the elevated blood glucose adequately. They need to control their blood sugar with changes to diet and exercise and often medication. Do you take any medications for your blood glucose?If you do not understand what changes you need to make, you should speak to your doctor about what is recommended for you specifically. Your doctor may have a sample diet menu or be able to recommend a nutritionist to help you understand the proper diet. There are also may diabetic cook books on the market that can help you to understand how to make common foods that are not going to spike your blood glucose. Additionally you should ask your doctor about an exercise program. Regular exercise is important for your health, but to be safe it is always recommended to getting your exercise approved by your doctor to make sure the level is safe for you.I hope this helps.Cathy",
