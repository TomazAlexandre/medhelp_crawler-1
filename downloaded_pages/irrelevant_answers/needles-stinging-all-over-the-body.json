            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies or vascular pathologies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Nerve conduction studies should be done. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. There are many other causes of nerve disorder causing pins and needles including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis and lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

            "answer": "I don't want to scare you or anything, but you might want to get checked out for Multiple Sclerosis since one of the symtoms is numbness and tingling. I am an MS patient myself but i don't suffer from that symptom per se put i know that could be one of the sighs. Good Luck!",
