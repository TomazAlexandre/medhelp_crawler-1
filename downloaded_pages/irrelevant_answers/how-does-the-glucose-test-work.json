It's basicly to see how your body metabolizes sugar in an hour. Has nothing to do with how you've been eating.Although if you do have diabetes it can cause rapid weight gain if not monitored.",

Anything over 130/140 (depending on the doc) you may be asked to make major changes to your diet or even take pills and you will have to test your sugar daily at home with a blood glucose monitor that uses a drop of blood from your finger.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and Hope you pass with flying colors :)",

Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that can develop in some women late in pregnancy (usually after the 24th week). Women who develop gestational diabetes do not have diabetes before becoming pregnant.The oral glucose tolerance test involves quickly drinking a sweetened liquid (called Glucola), which contains 50 g of glucose. The body absorbs this glucose rapidly, causing blood glucose levels to rise within 30 to 60 minutes. A blood sample will be taken from a vein in your arm about 60 minutes after drinking the solution. The blood test measures how the glucose solution was metabolized (processed by the body).A blood glucose of 140mg/dL will identify 80% of women with gestational diabetes. When that cutoff is lowered to 130mg/dL the yield increases to 90%. If your blood glucose level was greater than 130 mg/dL, your provider will likely recommend you take another diabetes screening test that requires you to fast (not eat anything) before the test. During this second test, called the 100-gram oral glucose tolerance test, your blood glucose level will be tested four times during a three-hour period after drinking the cola-like drink. If two out of the four blood tests are abnormal, you are considered to have gestational diabetes.",

    "question": "Tomorrow I am getting my glucose test done and I am sooo nervous! I was just wondering how the test actually works, like what they are looking for. I am not going to lie, this is my first pregnancy and I have indulged in my cravings. I have put on much more weight then even I expected and have eaten lots of sugary foods as well. Basically I want to know, is my bad eating habits going to affect the outcome of this test or does it have nothing to do with what I eat and more so just how my body handles the drink?",
