            "answer": "hiya,well im no doctor but it sounds like good old sweat/heat rash to me,im 36 and ive had psoriasis since i was 19,bad periods & not so bad,i get scaley spots in the same place\u00a0\u00a0as yours and although heat/sweat can intensify them they never really look like pimples,more like lots of little roundish rashes with white scaley skin.I think if you just try to keep that area as dry and sweat free as you can you may see improvement,i always find a mild non perfumed (johnsons baby powder) talc helps protect against sweating,hope this mite help.good luck",

    "question": "The title of my post pretty much says it all. I've had this off and on for about two weeks. It initially started on a hot day when I was at my desk essentially all day at work and was kind of sweaty/hot. Rash is initially itchy but becomes sore at some points, especially when I sit in one spot for prolonged periods of time. Also it gets quite irritated after I work out at the gym, but then \"cools off\" after I get home and take a cold shower. No puss or anything like that, but lots of pink/red pimple type things on my backside. I'm a 29 yr old male in pretty good shape/health if that matters. And pretty freaked out at the moment! Any info would help. Thanks!",
