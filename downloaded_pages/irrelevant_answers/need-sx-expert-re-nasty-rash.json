            "answer": "Because of the areas where the rash is, it sounds like a yeast infection.....usually treated with anti-fungal cream and then Nystatin powder.However, the fact that you also had thrush, which is also a yeast infection, means this is a recurrent problem.\u00a0\u00a0It may simply be caused by the treatment meds affecting your immune system but recurrent yeast infections can also be caused by DIABETES.\u00a0\u00a0Since the interferon can cause diabetes, I would ask the doctor to check your blood sugar (fasting).",

            "answer": "Could also be inverse psoriasis (interferon can wrek havoc with psoriasis), seborrheic dermatitis,\u00a0\u00a0or a layered combo of several conditions. Best to see a dermatologist as many skin conditions mimic each other and derm's generally are better able to differentiate one from another. My experience is that non-derms tend to over or under treat, using topical cortisoids a bit too freely.",
