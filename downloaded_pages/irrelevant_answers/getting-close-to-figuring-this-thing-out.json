            "answer": "There is one for (GAD) generalized anxiety disorder, it is called Lexapro and I know of people who are on it and they report it has made all the difference in the world for them, But it does come with its downfalls as well. Like you have to be slowly brought off it, You can not go cold turkey. Talk to a pharmacist about it. Better yet talk to your Dr. As far as I know there are not any licensed medical professionals on this forum. They offer opinions only-------Good Luck to You------NOAH",

            "answer": "there is a proven correlation between depression and nerve pain or neuropathy (burning, tingling, pain, especially in the feet).\u00a0\u00a0 Neuropathy is often treated with antidepressants.\u00a0\u00a0 ADs are not \"one size fits all\"..\u00a0\u00a0they have different mechanisms of action (SSRIs, MAO inhibitors, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0Cymbalta and Lyrica are two of the newer meds used for neuropathy; Cymbalta is an SSRI (seratonin reuptake inhibitor).\u00a0\u00a0It is sometimes a trial and error process to find the right one for you.\u00a0\u00a0It is always recommended to rule out other sources of neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0These include diabetes, nerve impingement (such as thoracic outlet syndrome) , some medications, alcoholism, and a family history of peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0good luck,\u00a0\u00a0Lisa",

    "question": "Dont mean to beat a dead horse here but I think I'm getting close.\u00a0\u00a0I have chronic pain in both feet and legs and docs cant figure it out.\u00a0\u00a0The past 3 months I have been focusing on my stress/anxiety to see if there is a corolation and guess what....THERE IS!I notice that when I am really stressed out my feet sting and legs just hurt.\u00a0\u00a0Went to a football game last night,\u00a0\u00a0GO SOONERS, and noticed that when I was having a good time the pain seemd to go away.Over the past 3 years I have been on Lortabs, Norcos, 75 mic Fenanyl patch, Darvocet and percs for pain.\u00a0\u00a0What I notice is when I take a pill my anxiety goes down and so does the pain level.\u00a0\u00a0I am a type \"A\" person anyway and am VERY high strung.\u00a0\u00a0Now I know that part of this kind of thinking is the addiction but there also has to be a corolation between stress/anxiety and pain.Here is my question.\u00a0\u00a0With the exception of drugs like Cymbalta and Prozac are there any other options for anxiety?\u00a0\u00a0I have tried Cympalta and Prozac before with horrible side effects.\u00a0\u00a0ANy thoughts on this would be appreciated.",
