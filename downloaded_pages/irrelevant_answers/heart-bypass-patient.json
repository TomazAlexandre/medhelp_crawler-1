            "answer": "For a perspective, your husband's heart has muscle damage due to heart attacks and the damage causes weak contractions.\u00a0\u00a0There is a measurement to reference the degree of disability of the heart's functionality.\u00a0\u00a0The measurement is the ejection fraction (EF) and indicates the amount of\u00a0\u00a0the left ventricle's capacity of blood pumped into circulation with each stroke.\u00a0\u00a0An EF25% (your husband's reading) is below 29% and in the heart failure range.\u00a0\u00a0The weak contractions from muscle damage will cause fatigue, etc. and sometimes depression as well that compounds the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is another problem that may interfere with medical therapy and is an unfortunate circumstance.\u00a0\u00a0An EF less than 29% is considered a disability with most insurance policy provisions!An EF25% may be temporary and the doctor may believe it will be increase with medication.\u00a0\u00a0Four years ago, I was hopitalized with an EF below 29% and a cath showed 13%.\u00a0\u00a0With medication it is now normal.Medication to help the heart function may be successful by lowering the resistance of\u00a0\u00a0constricted vessels, reducing fluids, increasing heart contractions, controling heart rate, etc. The medication will provide time for the heart to gain some strength, but there is an estimate of about 25% of the heart population that is in heart failure range and don't know they have a problem!\u00a0\u00a0 So it is possible to function adequately with an EF 25%... it depends on the individual and how well they are able to compensate.",

    "question": "My husband (age 47) suffered a heart attack in 2006.\u00a0\u00a0When at the hospital he was told for the first time that he had diabetes and probably had for a while.\u00a0\u00a0He also learned that based on the damage to his heart that this was probably not his first heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0His heart muscle was so damaged and weak that at one point it was at 8% capacity.\u00a0\u00a0The team of cardiologists told me that they weren't sure if he'd survive a surgery.\u00a0\u00a0So we waited and they pumped him with meds to make his heart function better.\u00a0\u00a0They finally decided that they would do a high risk bypass surgery.\u00a0\u00a0My husband ended up getting 6 bypasses.\u00a0\u00a0He has not been the same since his surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of getting better, I think he feels worse.\u00a0\u00a0Just last month, he was told that his heart was functioning at 25%.\u00a0\u00a0He is growing increasingly tired.\u00a0\u00a0It's getting to the point to where he doesn't think that he will be able to continue working.\u00a0\u00a0He's discussed this with his cardiologist; however, he does not seem too concerned about it.\u00a0\u00a0Should be be concerned?\u00a0\u00a0Is there some form of treatment or proceedure that we should discuss with the cardiologist?",
