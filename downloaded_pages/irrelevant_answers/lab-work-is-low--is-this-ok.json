The potassium is low which could affect your heart.It's possible he hasn't seen the results yet but either way you need to point it out and get some answers BEFORE your appt.Ren",

            "answer": "Haven't been following what's going on with you but sorry to hear you are having heart issues.\u00a0\u00a0You can take heart (groan) that if levels were dramatically bad they would have phoned you immediately, but that doesn't mean you shouldn't look at improving yourself.Remember a blood test is only a snapshot of you at a given moment, and electrolytes (sodium, potassium etc.) can change very quickly and be too high one reading and too low another.Low potassium is not a great thing to have.\u00a0\u00a0Bananas are a great source of potassium, as far as my murky mind can remember (keep worrying I am talking rubbish now, have forgotten the language of medicine).Renal impairment?\u00a0\u00a0Tricky one.\u00a0\u00a0In its early stages it can show as just the ocassional off reading.\u00a0\u00a0BUT, from what I remember you are (still?) on the underweight side.\u00a0\u00a0This will make readings less easy to interpret.I remember from so long ago reading your time line and just thinking it sounded like an endocrine problem.\u00a0\u00a0I'm no medical guru but it just seemed to leap out at me.\u00a0\u00a0May be nonsense.\u00a0\u00a0But have you seen an endocrinologist?\u00a0\u00a0Some of the neurological symptoms you describe, such as the involuntary movements of your head was it? can be from low levels of vitamins and minerals, such as magnesium or B12.\u00a0\u00a0It may be a problem of absorbtion.I still think, and am kind of glad to hear, as far as I understand, that you need to broaden your horizons and look beyond the neurological for answers.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms are there, but may not be from a neruo cause.\u00a0\u00a0We've talked about this before haven't we?You deserve to enjoy the best time of your life, your twenties.\u00a0\u00a0But forties are pretty good too!One last suggestion.\u00a0\u00a0Have you tried a good old fashioned naturopath?\u00a0\u00a0Or a really good nuitritionist/dietician.\u00a0\u00a0An on the ball one will test you for levels of essential foods in your blood.\u00a0\u00a0My vitamin d defiiency would never have been foung were it not for my dietician.\u00a0\u00a0And if you do have a deficiency, say eg. calcium, get levels checked again AFTER you have taken supplements for a while.\u00a0\u00a0You will have your answer there, if they do not go up it is an absorbtion problem.\u00a0\u00a0Used the eg of calcium, now wondering if it IS the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Yes am going on about nothing solid, sorry...read my post and you'll see why I'm writing and writing and.....But I so want to help you!Keep us informedwish",

            "answer": "yeah, it's 5:33 and still no call, and at this particular office they call even if the labs are all 100% fine (i know, i worked there for a week and when i called she said that's how they do it, they tell you even if they are fine).... i guess it'll be tomorrow 'till i hear. :P At least i know they are working on it.Wish, thanks for the post, i'll have to think about it. I know i've GOT to think outside of the neurologcal box, so that's always interesting to hear other folks thoughts. NYU did test for Vitamin D deficiency, and my cardio just ran another calcium check and i'm all good there. while you are right, electrolytes do change... i pulled my latest tests, and it seems that they've been running low since June of 2008.... so there has to be something cuasing it. Endocrine would be a thought- i might check into that at some point. I do eat bananas- actually. You'd think that my potassium would be fine, just like my magnesium should be fine since I take the recommended daily dosage but it's still low. Thankfully my cardiologist knows all this and that's why he ran this batch of tests to see why it's all running low.... he's a dearie.~Sunnytoday~",

            "answer": "From Lab Tests Online:\"Urine osmolality is frequently ordered along with plasma osmolality. It is used to help evaluate the body\u2019s water balance and to investigate increased and decreased urine output. Increased urine output may be due to increased fluid intake, lack of appropriate amounts of ADH, or diabetes mellitus (increased glucose levels leading to increased urine output). Decreased urine output may be due to a variety of causes including decreased blood flow to the kidneys, an appropriate response to dehydration, or damage to tubular cells in the kidneys. Urine sodium and creatinine are often ordered along with urine osmolality. Sometimes a urine osmotic gap is calculated and used to help evaluate the kidney\u2019s ability to excrete acid and reabsorb bicarbonate, to detect the presence of osmotically active molecules, and to compare with the plasma osmotic gap.\"and\"Low and normal levels of LDH do not usually indicate a problem. Low levels are sometimes seen when a patient ingests large amounts of ascorbic acid (vitamin C).\"and\"Decreased levels of potassium indicate hypokalemia. Decreased levels may occur in a number of conditions, particularly:dehydrationvomitingdiarrheaHyperaldosteronism (see Aldosterone)deficient potassium intake (rare)as a complication of acetaminophen overdoseIn diabetes, your potassium may fall after you take insulin, particularly if your diabetes had been out of control for a while. Low potassium is commonly due to \u201cwater pills\u201d (diuretics); if you are taking these, your doctor will check your potassium level regularly.Additionally, certain drugs such as corticosteroids, beta-adrenergic agonists such as isoproterenol, alpha-adrenergic antagonists such as clonidine, antibiotics such as gentamicin and carbenicillin, and the antifungal agent amphotericin B can cause loss of potassium.\"Not sure on the other tests, but it looks like they're part of a liver panel.\u00a0\u00a0The link for that is: http:// www. labtestsonline. org/ understanding/ analytes/ liver_panel/ glance. html\u00a0\u00a0(remove spaces).I'll be interested to hear what your doctor says about all this.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't sound really bad, but it does also indicate that you might have a malabsorption issue, especially if other levels have been consistently low.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have low iron or B12?Stephanie",

Or are these ok?Osmality, Urine 224\u00a0\u00a0(390-1090 mOsm/kg)My glucose was fine- 84 (74-106), I'm not pregnant, and I wasn't drinking too much water, in fact I don't drink but 1 or 2 glasses of water day\u00a0\u00a0so WHAT IS THAT???? I read that this low usually occurs when you have renal damage. IS THiS RIGHT?? If not, what is it? Quix???Potassium Blood 3.2 (3.5-5.1)SGOT 13 (15-37)SPGT 30 ( 30-65)LDH 92\u00a0\u00a0(100-190)Magnesium 1.6 (1.8- 2.4) this has been low for months even though I take Magnesium every dayVit D 35 (30-80)CPK 38 (21-215) these two are is fine, thank goodnessThese were done a few days ago by the cardio and I don't have a follow up with him until my heart test in July(?) and I got the copies from the hosp. lab to take to my many doctor's and have in my home files and was surprised to see them low. So, of course I came here to se if ya'll have any ideas! :)thanks~Sunnytoday~",
