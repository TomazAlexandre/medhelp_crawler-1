            "answer": "Using Sept 5th as a conception date (the earliest listed date you had sex), you would only be 5 weeks pregnant--- Based on your LMP you would be 11 weeks, however LMP in this case won't help as you stated you only had sex in Sept. You definitely know some of these are not due to pregnancy, such as butterfly feelings as you are nowhere far enough to feel fetal movement. Likely due to digestive or muscle spasms. Cravings happen to us all pregnant or not. Fatigue can be caused from many different medical problems or just a busy schedule. When you see your doctor make sure to request a beta blood test to find out what your hCG levels are at.",

            "answer": "Hi thanks so much for the feedback, I was waiting and waiting. And I didn't mention that I had sex every month with my boyfriend. I got off birth control in march, it made me depressed and gain too much weight/increased my appetite. I am waiting for the results of my blood test that I got two days ago. I went ahead and told them to test me for hypothyroidism, diabetes, and pregnancy of course. I have missed the period again this month and also I have had minor/dull cramping a few days ago until today on and off. the thing is that I changed my diet and exercise regimen and am under no stress, so maybe this is a result of eating really healthy/change of diet. But I also have been having mood swings and enlarged breasts. That missed period is a huge sign, tho. j/s.",
