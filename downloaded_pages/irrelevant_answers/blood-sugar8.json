            "answer": "I agree with troytroy that you need to meet with a doctor or diabetic educater to learn the basics of diabetes care. First of all being continually over 130 for fasting blood sugar is too high. Your wife needs to have her doctor evaluate her medication regimen and see if something needs to be changed. Also I'm guessing you don't know much about diet and exercise to help control Type II diabetes and this is very important to learn.When her blood glucose goes below 60 or she feels hypoglycemic (get to know the symptoms) she needs to treat the low. I don't think an emergency room visit is needed if the numbers are in the 50s and she can easily treat it with some glucose tabs (which should be kept nearby). Please do yourself a favor and learn more about management of this disease because feeling as desperate and confused as you sounded with your post is neither fun nor necessary.",
