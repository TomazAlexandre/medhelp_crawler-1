            "answer": "My Dr.'s office insists on going by the LMP, not the O date, or known date of conception. They will only change the EDD if you measure more than a week off. So they have me 3 days ahead of myself. I know my due date is 1/25, based on a conception date of 5/4,\u00a0\u00a0and they say 1/22, based on LMP od 4/18. It doesn't realy matter much though, as long as I know.",

    "question": "Hi, hope someone can help me with this, wondering if it is more accurate to tell what my delivery date will be if I know the date of ovulation in the cycle that I conceived in, rather than taking it from my last period.If someone can help me here are my details:First day of last period - 21st Nov 05last day of intercourse that month - 18th Dec 05Day of ovulation - 19th Dec 05I had been keeping temp charts for months and know I ovulated on day 19 that month.The EDD I have been given was 28th August 06 ( taken from my last period ) but at the 20 week scan I was told the EDD was now the 6th Sep 06.(How accurate are dates from scans anyway?)I have since been informed that pregnancy last for 267 day from conception so assuming I conceived at ovulation (day 19) the baby is due on the 2nd sep 06.When I test this against my first pregnancy ( as I know the day of ovulation that month also ) my son was born bang on the day he should have been and not 3 days late as they said.( Is this because I ovulate later in the month and not day 14 as they take as the \"norm\"?)Does anyone have any experince with this topic? I know its not a big gap between dates but I hate this wondering, if you have been pregnant you'll know how i feel!Thanks for your help.",
