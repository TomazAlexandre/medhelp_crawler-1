Interferon (IFN)-gamma treatment induces the expression of SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 mRNAs. To examine the effect of SOCS proteins on IFN-mediated Janus-activated kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) signaling, HeLa- and MCF-7-derived stable cell lines expressing SOCS1, SOCS2, and SOCS3 proteins were established. SOCS1 and SOCS3 but not SOCS2 inhibited the tyrosine phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of STAT1 in response to IFN stimulation. The IFN-mediated antiviral and antiproliferative activities were consistently blocked by the constitutive expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3 but not SOCS2 proteins. The maximum inhibitory activities of SOCS1 and SOCS3 proteins toward the activation of STAT1 were observed at very low levels of SOCS protein expression. In addition, SOCS1 exhibited a much stronger inhibitory activity toward the activation of STAT1 than did SOCS3. These results suggest that SOCS1 and SOCS3 but not SOCS2 are inhibitors of IFN-mediated Janus-activated kinase/STAT signaling pathways.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9857039?dopt=Abstract",

            "answer": "Actually, the article you reference states, \"The IFN-mediated antiviral and antiproliferative activities were consistently blocked by the constitutive expression of SOCS1 and SOCS3,\" which indicates that the overexpression of these genes directly block the cytokine, IFN-alpha.\u00a0\u00a0As you suggested, hyperinsulemia occurs further down the chain: increased hepatic glucose output--->impaired glucose tolerance--->insulin resistance--->hyperinsulinemia.A recent study of pioglitizone + SOC demonstrated that managing insulin resistance via upregulation of PPARy does not increase the efficacy of SOC therapy.\u00a0\u00a0A study with metformin + SOC seemed to indicate a small RVR outcome, but the study was very small and inconclusive.\u00a0\u00a0Because of these results, I tend to view insulin resistance as a symptom of something further upstream, that may need to be addressed upstream, the overexpression of SOCS3.\u00a0\u00a0TNF-alpha plays a vital role in mediating inflammation, but current TNF-alpha inhibitors come with a risk of infection, and possible carcinogenesis.\u00a0\u00a0I am suggesting SOCS genes as a target for therapy.\u00a0\u00a0The hepatitis C virus is well entrenched with a combination of viral and host factors.\u00a0\u00a0I hope medical science should do what it can, not only to address the virus itself, but also manage host factors that mediate viral resistance, as they are identified.Miles",

One was on Olanzapine ...which is famous for causing high blood sugar and the other one was on Zopiclone. And to top it off, when taken together, Actos causes the levels of Zopiclone to go up.They used non-responders who were probably interferon resistant, they didn't use the best insulin sensitizer and they allowed patients to take meds that could increase their blood sugar (therefore increasing the insulin resistance).\u00a0\u00a0 Call me crazy but the only thing that study proved is that it was poorly planned.The Metformin study showed an RVR 4x higher on the Metformin group and SVR results were not available yet.\u00a0\u00a0But there are a couple of interesting studies using Rosiglitazone and another using Metformin, Rosi or both (the arm using both lowered HOMA more).Bottom line...we know genetics are a factor ...but we don't have time to wait for something that will fix it (SOCS-3 is implicated in the etiology of diabetis too...so maybe we can borrow some of their studies...LOL).

            "answer": "Hi MilesYou sure you are not looking too low down Miles. To me it seems that its HCV core that\u2019s leads to IR. Also as you would already know HCV core activates CYP2E1 which is involved in the liver glucose cycle.HCV Core increases IRS-1 which leads to Insulin Resistance. HCV also activates CYP2E1 which releases glucose, which leads to IR. We then help it out by drinking Alcohol, by putting on weight and eating a high carb diet. Gets a bit circular all this ay.J Virol. 2007 Dec 26; : 18160431 (P,S,G,E,B)HEPATITIS C VIRUS CORE PROTEIN UPREGULATES SERINE PHOSPHORYLATION OF IRS-1 AND IMPAIRS DOWNSTREAM AKT/PKB SIGNALING PATHWAY FOR INSULIN RESISTANCE.Sutapa Banerjee, Kousuke Saito, Malika Ait-Goughoulte, Keith Meyer, Ratna B Ray, Ranjit RayChronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection has a significantly increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Insulin resistance is a critical component of T2DM pathogenesis. Several mechanisms are likely to be involved in the pathogenesis of HCV related insulin resistance. Since we and others have previously observed that HCV core protein activates c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), we examined the contribution of these pathways to insulin resistance in hepatocytes.Our experimental findings suggest that HCV core protein alone or in the presence of other viral proteins increases Ser(312) phosphorylation of the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1). Hepatocytes infected with cell culture grown HCV genotype 1a or 2a displayed a significant increase in the Ser(473) phosphorylation status of the Ser/Thr kinase protein kinase B (Akt/PKB), while Thr(308) phosphorylation was not significantly altered.HCV core protein mediated Ser(312) phosphorylation of IRS-1 was inhibited by JNK (SP600125) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI-3K) (LY294002) inhibitors. A functional assay also suggested that hepatocytes expressing HCV core protein alone or infected with cell culture grown HCV exhibited a suppression of 2-deoxy-D-[(3)H] glucose uptake.Inhibition of the JNK signaling pathway significantly restored glucose uptake despite HCV core expression in hepatocytes. Taken together, our results demonstrated that HCV core protein increases IRS-1 phosphorylation at Ser(312) which may contribute in part to the mechanism of insulin resistance.And this one show the same thing with G1b and G3aHepatitis C Virus Core Protein affects Insulin Signalling in a genotype-specific MannerMW DouglasThe aim of this project is to study the effects of HCV core protein from different virus genotypes on Insulin Signalling.Increased phosphorylation of Insulin Receptor Substrate (IRS)-1 at inhibitory serines312 and 639 was observed, more with Genotype 1b than with 3a core also preferentially increased phosphorylation of Gab1 and PTEN which inhibit IRS-1 signallingWe conclude that novel genotype-specific differences in Insulin Signalling in response to transfection with HCV core Protein are present in Hepatocyte-derived cell lines.These differences may account for the genotype-specific influences of CHC on Insulin Signalling.Hows things with you anywayCS",

The aim of this study was to assess the independent impact of IR after adjustment to major predictors of SVR, particularly HCV genotype and liver fibrosis stage. Patients andMethods:167 consecutive non-diabetic treatment-na\u00efve CHC patients, treated in our centre with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, were prospectively assessed. Insulin resistance was assessed using the Homeostasis Model (HOMA-IR). HCV genotype was determined by sequencing. Serum HCV RNA was quantified using bDNA (Bayer Versant HCV RNA 3.0 Assay). Liver histology was assessed using the METAVIR score. SVR was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA 24 months after treatment stopping.Results:Baseline characteristics were: male gender (66%), mean age (46\u00b19 years), mean BMI (24\u00b14 kg/m2), excessive alcohol consumption (9%). Blood transfusion and intravenous drug injection were the principal source of transmission (52%). HCV genotype distribution was: 1 (47%), 2 (7%), 3 (24%), and 4 (22%). Mean serum HCV RNA level was 5.5\u00b10.7 log10 IU/mL, and 42% of patients had high serum HCV RNA level (>600 000 IU/mL). Median value of HOMA-IR was 2.1 (IQL range 1.1-4.6). Liver histology showed moderate-severe necroinflammation (METAVIR score A2-A3) in 46%, severe fibrosis (METAVIR score F3-F4) in 32%, and severe steatosis (>30%) in 29% of patients. By univariate analysis, SVR was associated with HOMA-IR, HCV genotype, serum HCV RNA level, liver fibrosis stage and steatosis. Patients with HOMA-IR 2 (72% vs. 44% respectively, p<0.01). Patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3 achieved higher SVR rates than those infected with genotypes 1 and 4 (79% vs. 46% respectively, p<0.001). Patients with low viral load achieved higher SVR rate than those with high viral load (67% vs. 44% respectively, p<0.01). Patients with mild-moderate fibrosis achieved higher SVR rate than those with severe fibrosis (62% vs. 44% respectively, p<0.05). Patients with mild-moderate steatosis achieved higher SVR rate than those with severe steatosis (62% vs. 42% respectively, p<0.05). By logistic regression, SVR was associated only with HCV genotype 2 and 3 (p<0.001, OR=4.5, CI=2.0-9.8) and with HOMA-IR <2 (p<0.01, OR=2.8, CI=1.4-5.5)Conclusion:Insulin-Resistance is a major negative predictor of SVR in CHC patients treated with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Impact of IR is independent of HCV genotype and liver fibrosis stage.",
