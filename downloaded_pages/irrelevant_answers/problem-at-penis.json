            "answer": "Hi,This could indeed be due to an allergic reaction or inflammation. In particular, Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis. Inflammation has many possible causes, including irritation by environmental substances, physical trauma, and infection by a wide variety of pathogens, including bacteria, virus, or fungus. It is important that you have this evaluated further by your doctor for proper management. This condition is most likely to occur in men who have a tight foreskin that is difficult to pull back, or those who forget to clean and\u00a0\u00a0uncircumcised males. Diabetes is also a risk factor, especially if the blood sugar is poorly controlled.Proper diagnosis may include careful identification of the cause with the aid of a good patient history, swabs and cultures, and pathologic examination of a biopsy. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Hi,Do you have history of allergies? if yes, this is more likely. If not, this could also be an irritation to the lotion that could have triggered the inflammation. If left alone, this could\u00a0\u00a0cause edema, resulting in phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis. It would be best to have this evaluated for proper management. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "hi. about a week ago i shaved my penis and scrotum area using a mach3 razor. i don't know if the soapy film on the razor caused an allergic reaction or the sex with my wife was so good that my penis grew more than usual and stretched the skin too much. the foreskin is a little swollen and it has like stretch marks that look like if the skin was being ripped apart. now i can't pull the skin back to wash my penis head, as it would stretch the skin and hurt. what is going on? is this an std? allergic reaction? inflammation? what can i do to treat this?",
