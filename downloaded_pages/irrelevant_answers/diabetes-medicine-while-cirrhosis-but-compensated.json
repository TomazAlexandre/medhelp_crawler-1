            "answer": "Metformin has been around for a long time, and is pretty effective at decreasing insulin resistance. It might increase liver enzymes a touch, but it\u2019s usually a pretty good trade off. If you initiate metformin, you might get some mild to moderate GI issues; but these generally resolve after several weeks.Keep up with diet and exercise though; it really is an important component of DM II management, like it or not. What sort of A1c numbers are you getting?Are you considering HCV therapy? I\u2019m assuming your cirrhosis is due to HCV?Have you tried any other DM meds yet, including insulin?Bill",

My A1C has been under 6.0 consistently; for the past year and a half, anyway.During treatment, my blood sugar became *very* problematic, and I ended up adding Lantus insulin on top of the oral meds. I no longer require insulin; it tends to promote weight gain in those that are predisposed to that, from what I understand.I think metformin actually promotes weight loss; it seems to be the drug of choice initially for DM II; and it\u2019s very affordable on top of everything else. I\u2019d take a good look at it; like I say; it\u2019s been around for a while now.Good luck with everything,Bill",

            "answer": "I never tried oral meds for DM. I became diabetic after transplant and at that time I had a pretty vigorous regime - med wise. So, after research and discussion I decided insulin was the way for me. I asked several hepatologists which was the most benign drug and they agreed that exogenous insulin was probably the best in that respect - it didn't stimulate the pancreas of inhibit the liver. At that time I didn't want any more drugs impacting any organs. My A1C is affected by a drug I take - Dapsone - which causes low level hemolytic anemia. It was 3.8 a couple of weeks ago and though it's good I know it isn't that low. I stopped the Dapsone a while ago for about 4 months and tested - A1C = 5.5 - which I believe is accurate. I'm going to stop that drug for good soon.I have read a lot of good things about Metformin and I believe I may start taking that drug. I don't take much insulin - if I eat really right I need almost none. But, it is a cheater drug and it's easy to abuse diet and maintain normal range glucose levels - just dial up the pen.Mike",

            "answer": "Mike, you don\u2019t have an issue with weight, if I recall; I imagine insulin would likely work pretty well for you. My doctor was concerned that it might promote weight gain; and besides, during HCV treatment it really stopped working for me.My resistance became so high towards the end of treatment I was using all three oral drugs along with 115 units of Lantus insulin, and was regularly getting fingerstick results above 200, and A1c results of >8.5. A few months after I completed treatment, my insulin needs began tailing off, and I eventually stopped using it.I bet you\u2019d do well with metformin; it\u2019s not noted for hypoglycemic episodes when used by itself, and other than some initial and rather minor GI issues it\u2019s generally well tolerated.\u00a0\u00a0If your resistance isn\u2019t very high, and it sounds like it\u2019s not, you might get by with 500 or 1000 mg/day.I think it\u2019s been pretty well vetted over the years; I don\u2019t think there have been any strange stuff like cardiovascular toxicity as with some of the others like Avandia.Dapsone sounds like it\u2019s used primarily for skin issues; was this part of transplant medicine?\u00a0\u00a0It\u2019s also apparently used for brown recluse spider bites :o)?Good to see you posting, Michael\u2014Bill",

            "answer": "A comment on compensated and decompensated cirrhosis.\"Oh! I have had a esophageal bleed with grade III varices. Current med includes nadolol\" and omeprazole.....Grade III varices are large varices that measure 3-4 mm in diameter, are straight or tortuous, and sparse in number around the circumference of the esophagus at the level where they are located. Esophageal varices develop when normal blood flow to your liver is slowed due to scarring of the liver. The blood then backs up into nearby smaller blood vessels, such as those in your esophagus, causing the vessels to swell. Sometimes, esophageal varices can rupture, causing life-threatening bleeding.Nadolol is given to reduce portal hypertension . A symptoms of decompensated cirrhosis.Symptoms and Complications of Decompensated Cirrhosis -Patients with decompensated cirrhosis develop a variety of symptoms such as fatigue, exhaustion, loss of appetite, nausea, jaundice, weight loss, stomach pain, ,impotence, bruising and bleeding, and other potentially life threatening symptoms. Complications will also develop because the liver is unable to perform many functions. Complications can include:\u2022 A combination of factors such as portal hypertension, low albumin levels and kidney dysfunction produce an accumulation of fluid in the body. Ascites is the accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity. Edema is the accumulation of fluid in the extremities, especially the feet and legs.\u2022 Bleeding problems (coagulopathy) develop as the liver is unable to produce clotting factors. In addition platelet (for blood clotting) count drops because of an enlargedspleen.\u2022 As liver disease progresses there is bone mass and density loss.\u2022 The spleen stores red and white blood cells and platelets. An enlarged spleen develops due to blood being forced into it when portal hypertension develops. An enlarged spleen loses its ability to store red and white blood cells, and platelets.\u2022 Hardening of the Liver due to dying liver cells can be felt on examination.\u2022 A damaged liver is unable to regulate the production and breakdown of some female and male hormones. In women this can cause menstrual irregularities, and in men, gynecomastia (breast enlargement).\u2022 Impaired Mental Status is due to many factors. Toxic substances that are usually filtered by the liver reach the brain. Symptoms of encephalopathy include personality changes, changes in sleep patterns, sluggishmovements, drowsiness, confusion, stupor, and coma.\u2022 Itching (pruritus) can develop that can be debilitating. The cause of pruritus is believed to be caused by impairment or failure of bile flow complicated by jaundice.\u2022 Kidney function deteriorates in someone with decompensated cirrhosis, contributing to fluid retention (ascites, edema) and various kidney disorders.\u2022 People with hepatitis C who develop cirrhosis are at risk for liver cancer.\u2022 Muscle wasting can result from the liver\u2019s inability to metabolize proteins, which can make a person with cirrhosis more prone to bone fractures.\u2022 Scar tissue in the liver restricts the flow of blood and leads to portal hypertension resulting in complicationssuch as ascites, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis, varices and other potentially life-threatening complications.\u2022 Spontaneous Bacterial Peritonitis is a condition caused when the body\u2019s natural bacteria enters the ascites fluid causing severe infection.\u2022 The veins in the stomach, esophagus and rectum become so stretched and dilated (due to portal hypertension) that a condition called varices develops which can lead to internal bleeding.When the liver completely breaks down and is unable to perform its job, it is called end-stage liver disease (ESLD).The goal at this stage is to try to manage complications due to a deteriorating liver.Unfortunately, antiviral treatment is generally not recommended for people withdecompensated cirrhosis because HCV therapy can accelerate the decompensation process. If people are treated with HCV medications at this stage it is usuallyin the setting of a transplant center that can carefully monitor people during therapy. Currently, the only potentially effective treatment for end-stage liver disease is liver transplantation.Hectorsf",

            "answer": "Dapsone is also used for MRSA and leprosy Bill.I take Dapsone as a prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia which is thought to be a risk to liver transplant patients. Bactrim can also be used but I had a mild allergic reaction to Bactrim early post transplant so I was switched to Dapsone. My understanding is that many, if not most, transplant centers discontinue these drugs months after transplant. Mine believes in prophylaxis for life but I am seriously considering discontinuing the Dapsone. I am over 10 years out and never had Epstein Barr or Cytomegalovirus which are thought to make Pneumocystis infection more likely.I never did have a weigh issue but I have gained some weight in the last 18 months and could stand to lose 15 pounds so maybe insulin has stimulated a weight gain.
