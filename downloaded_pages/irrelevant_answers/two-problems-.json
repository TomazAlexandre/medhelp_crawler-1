            "answer": "Hi! Regarding the tongue and lump in throat, if allergy and vitamin deficiencies are ruled out, then it can be due to a bad case of acid reflux. Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks and spicy food. See if this helps.Regarding the forehead feeling hot if diabetes and hyperthyroidism are ruled out then temporal arteritis and low testosterone in males and low estrogen in females should be investigated. Please discuss with your doctor. Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "^ Thanks for yr help but could you explain alittle more for me :)Vitamin deficiencies I had done and all was fine but allergy deficiencies?? whats that?When you say acid reflux does this mean I would be feeling burning and heartache type of thing as well? I don't really have anything that would indicate that just the swelling feeling in the throat, it does feel like its reacting to something but no clue what it could be as I haven't changed anything or taking in anything new that I can think of, the feeling is almost all the time now though, sometimes hardly noticable sometimes very.Diabetes was ruled out with a work medical urine test\u00a0\u00a0afew months ago (if it was done right of course, they just stuck something in the urine and if it went a certain colour u had diabetes or something like that)Hyperthyroidism? Temporal arteritis? sounds serious :( how would I know about these?I have seen the doc afew times about the 'under the weather' feeling but Im always told its anxiety and 'they aren't worried about me', I think they don't want the work or something haha",

            "answer": "A single urine test is meaningless to diagnose diabetes. Such a test represented the standard of care in 1931 amongst villagers along the Amazon River.You require a fasting glucose test (or an insulin clamp protocol) and a test known as an hba1c.There is no such thing as an allergy deficiency, as I am sure doctornee knows. This is a matter of sentence structure. She meant to say rule out allergies as a separate possible diagnosis from vitamin deficiencies.As doctornee stated, a \"lump in the throat\" often (but not always) signifies acid reflux, and Omezprazole is the usual treatment prescribed.",

            "answer": "OK, I have asked my doc before about diabetes before but she reckoned I wouldnt be diabetic as there is no history of it in my family, I dont have a weight issue and my age (32)....I think thats what she said but I do get the impression GP's dont like to do any work and are quite happy to put everything down to having anxiety and stress.If it was diabetes what other problems/symptoms would I have? as I said I was having headaches, hot feeling on my forehead and dizzyness but thats calmed down now and its mainly just a hot feeling across my forehead, feels hot to touch too but I dont have a temp when I feel like this, thats the important thing. Apart from that I'm fine and normal with no other issues accept for the lump in the throat problem. I thought my work medical was pretty lame to be frank but they seemed pretty confident in the urine test so I dunno what to think.Can I ask how this possible acid reflux may have been triggered? like I say this all started straight after finishing a course of antibiotics if that makes a difference, never happened before, would I be getting any other symptoms with this?Omezprazole, is this a course of tablets? is this problem serious or does this medicine clear it up easy?",

            "answer": "Was wondering, would the blood tests I have had (liver n kidney, B12) give any indication of anything diabetes wise?Also someone on another medical forum told me this about the urine test....'A urine test is a good initial indicator of diabetes. It detects if you have glucose in your urine. When food is digested it is converted to glucose which is then absorbed into your blood. Insulin makes the glucose be absorbed by the body's cells for growth and energy. In diabetes, insulin is being prohibited in doing this so the glucose stays in your blood. Your kidneys will try to excrete this excess in your urine therefore a urine test will detect this. This also over time irrepairably damages the kidneys which can lead to complete kidney failure.As you say, you are young, not overweight and have no family history. If your urine test proved negative it is highly unlikely you have diabetes.'What do you reckon? I have two differing opinions here hehe",

    "question": "Hello,Wondering if anyone can advise me here, since the beginning of Oct last year I have been feeling under the westher right up to now. I was feeling totally fine one day then woke up the next day feeling 'off', I had slight headaches, dizzyness and my head felt hot. The problems have always been slight and never major but they just keep reoccuring on off on off. As time has past they have seemd to stop one at a time but I still feel 'off' at times and I still get this strange hot feeling across my forehead and down the side of my face, I have always checked my temp and I have never had a high temp, Ive had blood tests for liver n kidney, vitamin B12 levels and HIV to be sure and everything is fine and normal, Ive been to the doctor numerous times but Im told I have anxiety and stress but I really don't think thats it as this just appeared out of the blue one day when I woke up, it really is odd and fustrating.The other problem is I had a case of cellulitis about 2months ago, not major, went to the docs and was given antibiotics for a week which I finished. Ever since finishing the course I have had oral issues with my tongue being fuzzy, tingly feeling, abit red and sore and my throat is swelling on the inside from time to time etc...I have been given Nystan which has done nothing really but this is because I don't think it was ever a fungus problem as there has never been any white stuff or bleeding in my mouth, doctor told me it was glossitis, so I have let it just take its course so far and be careful with what I eat and drink etc...The situation has gotten better but I still find my tongue reacting when I maybe drink a hot drink, it becomes alittle red and sore ot it tingles but what really worries me is the fact the inside of my throat keeps swelling up. Its not a massive problem in the fact its stopping me breathing or anything but its just uncomfortable and feels like I have a lump in my throat, it doesn't hurt though. Whats going on here?? do I maybe have cancer somewhere!!?some please advise if you can, thankyou.",
