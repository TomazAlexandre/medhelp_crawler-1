So dont be worried if\u00a0\u00a0your baby is measuring bigger than he or she is supposed to be. That just means that he or she is healthy.",

Sometimes the genes in our family can pass on and my husband comes from a family where they are tall or just huge people. Going in for ultrasound next week to find out if its the baby who is big or im just having a lot of amniotic fluid inside. .",
