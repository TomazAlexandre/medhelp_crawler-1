            "answer": "I don't think they'll induce or do a c section based on baby's weight. Cus its always an estimate. Some babies are born vaginally at 10lbs. If you're still concerned I would dicuss your options with your doc.",

            "answer": "Ok thank you I wasnt sure. I dont want to have to have him early by force, the way I figured he'll come when hes ready. My Ob just vaguely said if hes still large that we will discuss \"options\".. I really want a natural birth although I sure hope his growing slows down a little, Im scared to.have a 10lb baby lol :)",

            "answer": "My baby is measuring 3 weeks ahead I'm 37 weeks and he's supposed to be 8 pounds and 2 ounces already. And I'm also very small I past my glucose test along with a steady weight gain. Anyways they made me do my glucose test again at 36 weeks but they said I just have an option to be induced early or have a c section if I want, or I can do natural if I feel I'm up to it.",

    "question": "I went in for my 32 week ultrasound yesterday and my son is measuring 2weeks and 2days ahead!!! They estimated hia weight at 5lbs 8oz already! I don't have diabetes and everything has been perfect up to now. My Ob said she feels the tech was off with her measurements seeing as nothing has been abnormal, my weight gain has been fine, and Im small enough still that I don't really look pregnant. She sscheduled me another ultrasound in a month and said we will see from there if hes still measuring huge! Is it possible he will even out between now and then? Maybe he had an early growth spurt? I know Im only 32 weeks because I know what day he was concieved.... If he's too big will they induce me early or possibly do a c-section? Please help ease my worries.",
