A hairdryer is useful if you have hairy sacs.The damp skin is an ideal site for fungi to multiply.Also wear cotton underwears and change them twice a day and do not share other people\u2019s towels.Application of local antifungal cream(terbinafine, clotrimazole, econazole, ketoconazole, miconazole) and oral antifungal drugs are the mainstay of treatment.If the symptoms persist then pls get it evaluated from a dermatologist.Xerotic eczema,senile pruritis,atopic dermatitis,contact dermatitis,parasitic infestations,diabetes and liver or kidney pathologies have to be ruled out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",

There is no more scabs or rough skin on my scrotum,however\u00a0\u00a0there is still is a lot of itching that i have to scratch like crazy . I think i'm gonna go to a doctor for some pills maybe just to be safe and get rid of it finally once and for all !! This spectrogel , is you rub it in to your skin in a circular motion in the bath and do this for at least 30 seconds and then you pat dry with towel and then i use a blowdryer to make sure its really dry.This seems to have helped\u00a0\u00a0it a great deal .

            "answer": "I know this may sound hard. But do not scratch. I had a similar problem. You need to be very careful with the skin in that area. I used an icepack to numb the area, when it itched. If it is tinea, you may need to use something stronger. I used the cream that comes with woman's yeast infection kits. It worked allot better.",

    "question": "For the past 2 yrs i have had\u00a0\u00a0off\u00a0\u00a0and on a hot itchy feeling on my scrotum and no where else.I have to scratch till its raw and I have used\u00a0\u00a0prescription creams\u00a0\u00a0and powders and non irritating soaps to try and get rid of it .I also get about 2 to 3 scabs sometimes that i end up scratching off and they hurt. I also get an itchy feeling like it seems up my pee hole. Sometime at night i wake up and my scrotum\u00a0\u00a0feels very hot , I have to remove the blanket till it cools . I must add that i am 50 yrs old , married with same partner and i am at my wits end with this . The problem is only on my scrotum and no where else on my body! I don't think its herpes because i have seen pictures and I have no blisters or anything closely resembling the photos.\u00a0\u00a0Please if anyone can help I would be very grateful.",
