            "answer": "I worked 50+ hrs a week until I was 36 weeks. The only reason I stopped then was BC I was gestational diabetic with gallbladder disease and I was told if I had one more major attack they would do emergency surgery and have to deliver my son in the process. If it wasn't for that I prob would have worked longer. I was a fast food manager on 3rd shift so I couldn't chance it. I didn't know the first attack was gallbladder it felt like labor. With this one I'm working as long as absolutely possible.",
