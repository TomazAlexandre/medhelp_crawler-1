    "question": "We have an older cat (he'll be 16 this year). We've had him since he was about 6 months old. We also have one who will be 11 this year (had him since he was about 6 weeks).Our older cat has pretty well stopped using the box. On the rare occasion that he uses it, he doesn't cover it up !The younger one will actually go cover it up for him...He uses my daughters floor for a bathroom. If we lock him up in a room with no carpet, he'll use the box. We went away over the weekend, and put him in the room off the bottom level that isn't carpeted and NO messes when we got back. But, if we don't lock him up, he uses the carpet. He's never done this before. No change in food...no new animals...I don't understand it. I do NOT want to have to put him down if he's not sick...but we can't keep locking him up and we can't keep letting him poo all over the floor...Please help if you have any suggestions...",
