            "answer": "It is not unusual for the lining to build up during perimenopause due to the hormonal changes. Thankfully, the body typically does a good job of sloughing off the lining on its own before abnormal cells / hyperplasia can develop. And if hyerplasia should develop, most cases have a high cure rate with progestin or progesterone therapy. Endometrial cancer is rare with a woman's lifetime risk being less than 3%. Some conditions do increase your risk such as being obese, having diabetes or high blood pressure, previous history of tamoxifen use, or taking estrogen without progesterone.Low dose birth control pills can regulate the cycle (keeping the lining thinned out) as well as normalize menopausal symptoms if you are experiencing any of those. Those tend to be tolerated better than straight progestin or progesterone but every woman is different. Being 52, you may be close to menopause so may not need to monitor this situation much longer.I hope this helps ease your mind a bit.",

    "question": "i am a 52 year old perimenopausal women with irregular periods. I went to my gyn doctor, because I told her i did not have a period in four months she gave me an appt to have transvaginal sonogram. it showed thick uterine lining of 10 mm therefore she said that i needed an endometrial biopsy which i had. my results came back benign, thank God. I asked her if I needed to take any hormone therapy like progesterone, she said no she does not like putting her patients on hormones due to the side effects only if absolutely necessary. so basically she just wants me to see what happens with my periods. I did get a full period three days after the biopsy which was good but who knows when I will get another one. My question is: will the thickness revert back to normal again or will this be an ongoing problem that perhaps will get worse in time???? Is there any natural vitamins to take for this????",
