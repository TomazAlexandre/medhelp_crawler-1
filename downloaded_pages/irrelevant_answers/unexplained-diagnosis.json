            "answer": "Hi,How many times was his GFR determined?A GFR of 17 is low.Would you know how they computed for the GFR? Did they use nuclear GFR?What were the serum creatinine levels in the past 3 months?I understand how your dad feels about this. With a GFR of 17, dialysis will eventually be indicated. The value of 17 is categorized as severely decreased GFR. You need to discuss your father's case with his physician. Given that your father does not sound cooperative with possible future management, this is something that your physician and family members have to look into.However, it is also important to look into reversible causes of decreased GFR which include the presence of hypotension , infections, heart problems, structural problems in the urinary tract and intake of certain medications that may be harmful to the kidneys. These conditions need to be managed first .",
