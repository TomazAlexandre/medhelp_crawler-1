            "answer": "Hi,Peripheral neuropathy can be caused by metabolic conditions like diabetes, thyroid disorders and by vitamin deficiencies like B 12 deficiency.The treatment will depend upon the cause which can be identified by clinical exam and tests like blood tests.Certain neurological conditions like mini stroke and MS also cause pins and needles like sensations in the body.http://www.ninds.nih.gov/disorders/peripheralneuropathy/detail_peripheralneuropathy.htmhttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/peripheral-neuropathy/DS00131Thanks",

    "question": "Hello,My gran has recently been getting pins and needle-like sensations in her hands and feet and has been feeling unsteady when walking. she went to out of hours and they strongly suggested that it sounded like perepheral neuropathy.Basically, when she visited her GP afterwards, they didnt seem to want to know and didnt give her any information on the condition. So could anyone give us a better idea of what it is and what causes it? and is there any treatment available that can relieve the symptoms?thanks in advance",
