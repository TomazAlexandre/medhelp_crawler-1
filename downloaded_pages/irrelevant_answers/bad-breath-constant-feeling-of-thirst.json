            "answer": "Having a feeling of constant thirst is a typical sign of diabetes.If you have not had a blood test taken to check your HbA1C levels, make an appointment with the doctor again and do tell him that you have constant thirst.\u00a0\u00a0The HbA1C blood test measures the average glucose levels in your blood over a 9-12 week period and this gives a good indication whether you are diabetic or not.Another reason for feeling constant thirst is eating too many sugary foods and as mentioned above could be a sign of diabetes.Also another reason for feeling constantly thirsty is having too much salt in your diet, and drinking alcohol that will dehydrate you.With regard to your bad breath, as your oral hygiene is fine and there is no tooth decay or throat infection, you may have a lot of mucus due to post nasal drip.\u00a0\u00a0That can make you feel thirsty and give you bad breath.\u00a0\u00a0Keep off the milk for a few days as milk encourages the formation of mucus.If your diet consists of very spicy and strongly flavoured foods with onion and garlic, that will give you a bad breath.\u00a0\u00a0If you suffer from stomach problems that also can cause bad breath.\u00a0\u00a0Eating raw parsley is supposed to help alleviate bad breath.You could also buy some mints or mint chewing gum to help against bad breath, it is better to get to the bottom of things.\u00a0\u00a0Look at the things that you eat and drink to see if you can made some changes.Best wishes.",

    "question": "recently i had a blood test,urine test and a thyroid scan and wasn't given a solution to my health problem.i wake up with really really bad breath,i have had bad breath for a while but for the past 3 months i feel like being sick when i wake up and throughout the day it is also bad,i always feel the need to drink juice/milk. however the smallest sip of water and i feel the same way as i did in the morning. WATER STARTS BAD BREATH OFF AGAIN,but water has no taste so what am i tasting..i take care of my teeth and oral health,the doctor said everything with me is fine.So confused on what or where it could have come from that the tests did not pick up.",
