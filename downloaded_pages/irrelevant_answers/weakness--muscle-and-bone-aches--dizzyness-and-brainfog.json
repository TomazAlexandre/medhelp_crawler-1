            "answer": "Hi, I have already sent you a message from another question you had. I know you have been checked for diabetes but have you been checked for low blood sugar or insulin resistance (also called metabolic syndrome). Here is a web site that you should look at and see if this sounds like your condition. From what I have read you have many of the symptoms listed. My sister and I have both been diagnosed with this condition. You mentioned that your liver enzymes are elevated some times. This happens to my sister as well and she was told by our Endocrinologist that insulin resistance can cause this. We both lost our gall bladder a few years back (from unknown causes) and haven't been the same since. We also suffer from pain throughout our bodies. You need to be thoroughly checked for this condition and any autoimmune conditions. If you are over weight, eat a lot of processed foods, carbohydrates and simple sugars this could be the condition you have. Researchers also believe that insulin resistance could be hereditary.Here is the web site:www.naturalchoicesforyou.com/site/680805/page/219656Hope you find an answer",

            "answer": "hisorry i didn't reply previously, yeah i have had a history of a very bad high sugar diet, alot of junk food, i was overweight, i lost the weight now, also bloods shown my cholesterol was high i'm working on reducing it, also got fatty liver this time round,\u00a0\u00a0i thought it could be hypoglycemia but i don't think it is after a few checks also neg for diabetes, how can i test for insulin resistance?so the treatment or part of it is a low carbohydrate, weight loss, exercise, no starchy vegs,sugars, fatty, junk foods, make sure reduce cholesterol.any advice on how to reverse or what kind of diet i can choose frommy gallbladder is very slow in working,i get burning feet at night, i read on that site is part of the symptoms, also got eye floaters, i find i do have sensitivity to sugar i do notice it, also get bloated around the body when i eat sugars, feel better when i don't eat it, so yeah, i have been overweight, but not obese, with a very high sugar diet with less exercise in my life. So it can also raise the liver enzymes too, i tell you somthing odd i find, when i exercise and have a good diet wel i figured this out recently, my liver enzymes go down almost to normal, so you could actually be right.thanks, it does make alot of sense what you have highlighted.",
