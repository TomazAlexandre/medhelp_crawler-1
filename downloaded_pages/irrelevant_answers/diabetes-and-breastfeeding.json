            "answer": "I breastfed my first two and will with this one. I didn't notice any significant changes with my insulin dose or anything. Obviously once the baby is born, you return to prepregnancy carb ratios, but it only takes a day or so of adjustment. Breastfeeding just fits right in, it doesn't change your insulin needs. That was my experience anyway.",
