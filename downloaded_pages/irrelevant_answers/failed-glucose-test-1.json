            "answer": "Ya I would agree with the person above saying the are trying to set you up with a failure. I was told to not eat anything with natural sugar or added sugar. And I always would eat egg on toast and never failed. My friend are cocoa puffs before hers and failed. So you really shouldnt eat candy or drink soda. Because the glucose test is to see how your body process sugar so if you eat all that stuff and then drink the drink you will have an enormous amount of sugar and you will fail.",
