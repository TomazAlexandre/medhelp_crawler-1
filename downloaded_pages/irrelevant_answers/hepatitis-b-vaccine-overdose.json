    "question": "Hi,I have been dealing with a number of health issues going back several years. My symptoms first began about a month after I received my final dose of the Hep vaccine. I later learned that when I changed doctors nobody bothered to forward my records to my new PCP and my mom didn't bother to look through my vaccine record. I had just gone through the hep b vaccine schedule 2 years prior and we were going on a cruise so the agent misinformed my parents that we needed the vaccine (found out later it wasn't even necessary) and so I was given the rounds of the vaccine again. About a month after the vaccine I started getting really sick and suddenly developed hypothyroidism out of nowhere at the age of only 19. Also started having some crazy hormone issues, and my immune system shut down so I got mono in the middle of summer not being around anyone. I've read some studies that show the vaccine has potential to cause liver damage and I have had some liver issues ever since and wonder if this would have been an overdose causing this? It's been over a decade now and wonder if there's anything I can do to get it out of my system if so?",
