            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Long thread can be tapeworm or undigested fiber. Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber and also due to dehydration. A high roughage with low water too could be a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc can all cause constipation. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Too many tape worms or round worms forming a bolus or ball could also be the cause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Take care!",
