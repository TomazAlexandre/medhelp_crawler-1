            "answer": "Hello,Blood in urine is called hematuria.Some causes of hematuria are kidney stones, infections of the urinary tract or genitals, blockage of the urinary tract, usually the urethra - by a stone, a tumor, a narrowing of the opening (stricture), or a compression from surrounding structures ,cancer of the kidney, bladder, or prostate(rare in young), kidney disease,blood clotting disorders ,injury to the upper or lower urinary tract, as in a car accident or a bad fall, medications \u2013 antibiotics,analgesics such as aspirin, anticoagulants, phenytoin (Dilantin) and quinine ,benign prostatic hypertrophy (BPH), a common condition in older men ,chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension, and sickle cell anemia ,viral infections ,inflammation of the kidney - usually of unknown cause and strenuous exercise, especially running - results from repeated jarring of the bladder.http://www.emedicinehealth.com/blood_in_the_urine/page2_em.htmCan you identify any of these?Sometimes the cause is idiopathic i.e no cause is known.In such cases the hematuria will probably go away by itself or continue as a chronic condition without doing harm.I feel that you should discuss these possibilities with a urologist and get yourself thoroughly investigated so as to form a confirmatory diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hi,Do you notice blood at other times on you underwear?\u00a0\u00a0It may not be coming from your urine.\u00a0\u00a0Blood in the urine is of course possible but is often associated with pain as it is vey irritating as it comes out.The blood may be spotting of menstrual blood, or even from a haemorhoid in the back.\u00a0\u00a0It could even be something external such as a skin infection.\u00a0\u00a0The best thing would be to go to the doctor, who will ask you to urinate in a small pot, and then test it for blood and other things.\u00a0\u00a0They can then decide whether it is best to examine you, refer you on, or treat you for any infection.\u00a0\u00a0I know you have alread seen doctors but unless you tell them they will not know the problem is continuing.\u00a0\u00a0You may for example need to see a gynaeecologist or uro-gynaecologist.I am assuming you have started your periods.\u00a0\u00a0They take some years to settle down.\u00a0\u00a0If you have not started, this too is a good reason to talk again with your doctor.",
