            "answer": "I'm a little confused, tarter. When you say your husband has \"high readings 16-25 but no signs of diabetes\", are those blood sugar readings? If so 16-25 (288-450 U.S.) ARE diabetic readings and the 25 especially is dangerously high. The fatigue and weight loss could very much be symptoms of diabetes. He should get checked with an A1C (an average of blood sugars for the last couple months). He should also have his Type clarified as weight loss often comes with Type 1 (or LADA, a slow onset type 1) not Type 2. If he becomes ill with flu-like symptoms and vomiting he needs to go to the ER.If the numbers were not blood sugar readings, ignore this advice!",

            "answer": "Whatever the cause of high blood sugars, they must be treated to reduce those numbers ASAP as the results of consistently extreme blood sugars are very serious. I recommend he see an endocrinologist and get a c-peptide and antibody test. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disorder and has nothing to do with how you eat or drink. Bottom line is he needs immediate help in controlling his blood sugars.",

            "answer": "Exposure to toxic chemical vapors can lead to molecular destruction/abnormality.\u00a0\u00a0The C-Peptide test is a start but should include an insulin level test help determine how much insulin a person's pancreas is still producing. Also recommend having the Thyroid and Immune System thoroughly checked as these play an important role with insulin production. Controlling glucose levels may reduce the severity of fatty liver in patients with diabetes. Lastly, pay close attention to the side effects of medications taken. Google search drug interactions. Good luck.",
