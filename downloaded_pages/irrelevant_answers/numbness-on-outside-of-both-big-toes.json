            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Prolonged pressure on the toes as in wrong foot wear or compression of the lumbar nerves supplying the area can cause numbness. Since it is on identical points, I suggest you change your foot wear and see. If it does not help, consult a doctor. Numbness at the side of the big toe can also be due to poor circulation, diabetic neuropathy, leprosy, nerve injury, multiple sclerosis and frost bite. This needs to be investigated before a final cause can be pin pointed.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "you probably have a pinched nerve or sciatica. I have back pain issues, compressed discs, pinched nerves, etc. and occasionally I will have a week where I wake up and my toes are numb and tingly. Wierd, but it absolves itself. I would see a doctor just to make sure everything is okay.",

    "question": "For the last couple of days I have noticed that the outsides of both my big toes have been continuously numb, as if they fell asleep. I am a 22 year old female so it's not old age, and I don't have dvt or diabetes. Since it is in the same exact spot on both toes I'm thinking it has something to do with nerve damage. Does anyone know what this could be, or know whether or not I should contact a doctor? Thanks.",
