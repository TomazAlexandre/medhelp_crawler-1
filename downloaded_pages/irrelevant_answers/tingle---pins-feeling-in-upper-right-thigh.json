            "answer": "Hi,The tingling feeling in the thigh can occur due to compression of the femoral nerve which is known as meralgia paraesthetica. Other causes include peripheral neuropathy due to vitamin B 12 deficiency, diabetes and thyroid dysfunction.This warrants a complete neurological exam, please get it done. Also in the meantime you can take OTC B complex supplements and see if they help.Good luck.",

    "question": "Over the last several months, I've been getting this tingling feeling in my upper right thigh, mostly noticable when I'm in bed, but it generally seems to stick around durring the day as well - though, very mild, to the point where I may or may not even notice it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 38, and while I have been losing weight, I still have a long way to go.\u00a0\u00a0Also, don't know if it's at all related, but about 20 years ago, I was involved in a motorcycle accident, and I fractured my C7 vertibrae - the doctors at that time told me that I would likely have some neck issues when I got older.This tingly feeling seems to be worst in the morning (sometimes cramping, and waking me up out of a sound sleep), and seems to be becoming more and more noticable - and more pronounced.",
