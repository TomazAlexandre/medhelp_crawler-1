            "answer": "The problems with your vision could well be progression of the cataracts, especially if your diabetes is not well controlled. Cataracts however do not cause the eyes to burn and water. Your age, gender and health issues make \"dry eyes\" or \"tear quality dysfunction\" a likely cause for the comfort problems.If you blood surgars and not well controled (a hemoglobin A1c of 7.0 or more) your cataracts will grow faster, you have a higher risk of diabetes in the eye and can cause your glasses prescription to fluctuate.A repeat examination by your ophthalmologist is appropriate.JCH III MD Eye Physician & Surgeon",

    "question": "I am 60yr old female. When I first get up in morning, my eyes take about an hour before they seem to focus well.\u00a0\u00a0I have to continually move my glasses up and down, or my whole head, to read. Middle of day seems better, but very sensitive to light. I drive at night. When I get home from work, I can't hardly read computer screen. My eyes are burning right now, and feel like they have a film over them. My last checkup was in October last year. I have a beginning cataract in my left ey, which is the one I have the most trouble with. I am continually rubbing them to try to improve my vision. Is this just old age? Should I go back to Opthomologist? I also have Type II Diabetes. I am a widow, recently had C5-6 deskectomy & fusion, and would have trouble affording new glasses at this time. Any answers would be appreciated. Even with my glasses I can't hardly read what I just wrote, very fuzzy, feels like a film over my eyes. Help!",
