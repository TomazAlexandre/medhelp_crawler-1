            "answer": "There arent really any physical symptoms of gestational diabetes other than baby measuring larger than normal because they are absorbing rhe excess sugar you arent able to break down fast enough... just because you weren't able to keep down the drink doesn't mean you have gestational diabetes... it just means they will have to re test you for it... I have known plenty of women who cant keep it down and have to take it 3 or 4 times because they kept throwing it up before the 1hr was over... I failed both my tests :(",
