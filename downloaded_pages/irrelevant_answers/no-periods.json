            "answer": "Your story sounds very familiar to mine.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have a period unless I was on birth control.\u00a0\u00a0They did some blood tests to determine that I had PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0They looked at my insulin levels, glucose levels, thyroid, and I can't remember what else.\u00a0\u00a0My insulin levels were high as well as the other thing I can't remember.\u00a0\u00a0Glucose was normal, so that indicated that I did not have diabetes.We happen to have really good healthcare, and a wonderful OB that worked with us and got the right diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0She also sent us directly to a fertility specialist which specialized in insulin resistance PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0He indicated that there were a couple of different ways for us to be able to conceive (We were ready a year ago - so we stepped up the process).\u00a0\u00a0He did recommend going on a diet (I have also been overweight for many years).\u00a0\u00a0He recommended doing a PCOS diet - you can find books on this!\u00a0\u00a0For the main part, it was going very little carbs, or switching them to whole wheat.\u00a0\u00a0Making sure you eat protein and fibers before carbs.\u00a0\u00a0This made a huge difference for me - I lost 10 lbs in about a month.\u00a0\u00a0Also he recommended about 20-30 minutes of light excercise - walking at a 2-3 mph pace every day.Because I was inpatient to wait that long to loose all the weight and get everything in line, we ended up working with the fertility specialist and got pregnant very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible to conceive with PCOS - but it can take some time, and possible some money.Good luck and keep up hope!",

            "answer": "I have had a similar situation.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't had my period on my own for over a year now, and even stopped getting it while still on Mircette (birth control).\u00a0\u00a0My OB moved us onto a fertility specialist ASAP and with a moderate PCOS diagnosis, despite no cysts, I am waiting for my first beta blood test tomorrow to see if our round 1 of IVF was successful.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you much luck and persistence to get answers from your doctors!\u00a0\u00a0Remember...you know your body best!",
