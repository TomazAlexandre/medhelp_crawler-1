            "answer": "I am sorry to say that I really have no idea as to what this could be.I wish I could help more. If you are using a naturopath and are without insurance, I would suggest trying\u00a0\u00a0D3 to help your immune system fight this. D3 is cheap and over the counter at Costco, walmart, walgreens etc.Lots more info at www.vitamindcouncil.org\u00a0\u00a0They explain the benefits of using D3 and how being deficient can cause many severe health problems. You could start with 5,000 IU of D3 a day. It takes time to build up in your system. Your blood levels of D3 should be between 50-70 ml. Since having blood work is expensive, I would just start taking the D3.At the least it should help with the bone pain. My daughter had a limp and bone pain in the leg all the time. Turns out she was very deficient in D3 at a level of 10. The doc checks her 2 times a year to see what her levels are and she currently is on 10,000 IU a day.\u00a0\u00a0The pain went away and has never returned. We were all tested and found out everyone in my family was deficient in D3.It sounds like a 5,000 IU of D3 is a lot, but 10 min in the summer sun without any sunscreen in a bathing suit will make your skin make 25,000 IU of D. Sun bathing will also help but it is to easy to burn without the sunscreen and your skin won't make the D with it on. Our doc said the only way to increase your levels year round without damaging your skin was to supplement.You can get some D3 from food, but again not enough. Find some cheap D3 near you and I hope it helps.Other people will have other ideas too.Good luck,Elbamom",

            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your condition. Evening rise in temperature is generally due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis. Since ESR is normal, tuberculosis is ruled out. Thyroid issues are also ruled out in your case. So, I guess anemia and diabetes needs to be ruled out immediately. Both can cause body aches, joint pains, headaches, fever etc.Blood in urine can be due to UTI (ruled out in your case), kidney stone (canbe missed on CT if stone is small, vaginal and cervical infections (in females), prostatits (in males), affection of kidney as in diabetes and hypertension. Hope you can discuss this with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for your ideas. I am 5'7\" and 135 pounds. I have very few diabetic symptoms at all and no one in my family, immediate or otherwise, has diabetes. Would it make sense that I have blood in my urine from an undetectable kidney stone for 4 months? I just received a notice in the mail that the 6th primary care physician has left the small group I am in and the only ones I can see for future care are nurse practitioners until further notice.There are no accolades for our new health care here...I'm doing all I can myself since I have a family to care for. Thank you doctornee.",

    "question": "I initially went to the Dr in January 2013 due to extreme exhaustion, a low grade fever for two weeks and very intense joint pain, intermittent headache for 2 weeks and thinking I observed a change in my urine color but no pain for a UTI. Having no insurance,the Dr did a urine test and found microscopic hematuria (he said it was a 10 & they get concerned when level is 5 or above). He also said that I had no signs of infection and confirmed a fever in the office. Blood work for inflammation was normal, no sign of infection, liver profile normal and basic thyroid levels normal.\u00a0\u00a04 weeks later, blood still noted in urine and no change in fevers brought on a CT scan of abdomen out of pocket payment. It turned out normal. It's now been 4 months.i sometimes have a near normal tempi the morning,but it will rise 2 degrees by evening if I have done more than rest for the day. Their recommendation is a urologist for the blood issue right now,but no idea for the fevers, fatigue, headaches every now and then, bone pain that can waken me put of sleep sometimes, and so on. My SED rate was NORMAL, despite extreme pain in the joints and fighting fibromyalgia 14 yrs now through homeopathic remedies and diet. I'm a health nut...organic foods, and working with a Dr friend who's a naturopath. But even in this, he does not know what could be causing my symptoms. I am stuck due to a lack of insurance and Drs very backed up in our office. Any help would be so appreciated.",
