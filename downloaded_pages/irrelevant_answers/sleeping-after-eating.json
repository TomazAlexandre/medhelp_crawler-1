    "question": "Sometimes when I eat, like last night after I ate a frozen Turkey pot pie I felt so drowsy afterward and went into a deep sleep for a couple hours. I actually feel better if I don't eat much, whenever I eat certain types of food I feel bad and tired. I try to eat somewhat healthy, I don't over eat and I don't drink sugary drinks, I always drink water. But I do indulge in chocolate ice-cream, but I don't over do it. Usually I will eat a dessert once a day and I eat small proportioned meals. I also urinate a lot but I have always had problems with frequent urination since I was a child. Could this still be pre-diabetes?",
