            "answer": "Thyroglobulin may occur in organ-specific autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, type I diabetes mellitus , polyglandular endocrine failure syndromes etc.Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and pernicious anemia are sometimes positive. As well as in the normal population without thyroid disorders. The presence of autoantibodies to thyroglobulin are likely to appear after trauma to, or inflammation of, the thyroid gland.Hence an increased thyroglobulin alone in a patient not known to have thyroid cancer is not a sensitive or specific test for the diagnosis of thyroid cancer.In patients with a known diagnosis of well differentiated thyroid cancer (most types of papillary and follicular disease), the serum thyroglobulin (Tg) is a useful ancillary marker of disease activity and provides information about the state and extent of residual functioning thyroid tissue in patients both on and off L-thyroxine suppression or after stimulation with recombinant TSH. Ideally, the thyroglobulin levels will be low or undetectable after treatment (usually surgery followed by radioactive iodine).I don't think you have cause for worry per this info.\u00a0\u00a0Tell your husband to stop dreaming ;) bad things anyway.Lucy looks like she has TED (?)Happy Holidays!",

    "question": "Disclaimer:\u00a0\u00a0Bare with me, in that the lab didn't get back all of the numbers to my doc, which is another discussion, entirely.\u00a0\u00a0Grrrr.My husband had a dream about a week ago that I died of thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Which, in and of itself, although scarey, usually would be brushed under the rug due to his worry about me finding an answer to my thyroiditis issue.Moving forward to the results I finally got 12/5: that my Thyroglobulin Autoantibodies is H 96.6 (0-40) and my Thyroid Peroxidase Auto Antibodies is H 43.8 (0-35) My TSH is at 4.25, depending on the lab you go to, he said was on the higher side of normal.\u00a0\u00a0(this, still, makes no sense to me.)My doc said NOTHING about thyroid cancer, just that we're going to try the synthroid at this level for a month, then drop it in half for a month and recheck, and that all the results have not been sent by the lab.\u00a0\u00a0 I read somewhere that one of my numbers could indicate thyroid cancer and so between the my husband and the test (and the fencepost) I have an underlying fear of thyroid cancer...should I?",
