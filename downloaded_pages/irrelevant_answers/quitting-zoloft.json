            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. I do have access to various doctors, but none that I could say I trust with my life. For that decision, I need to trust myself and God. I was functioning fine prior to beginning Zoloft, and while it has reduced some of the anxiety I was experiencing then, I feel that I am capable of managing them without medication. Won't know until I try, correct? Besides, the weight I put on due to the Zoloft is not healthy, nor does it improve my diabetes.I was hoping someone may have experience with quitting Zoloft and could offer their experiences and perhaps some tips.Thanks again.Zake",

            "answer": "I take 87.5 mg a day (I cut them into pieces).\u00a0\u00a0I do have experience coming off Zoloft, but it was at the wrong times in my life (wife's midlife crisis).\u00a0\u00a0I also seem to be very sensitive to drugs (I can take 1/4 Xanax and get a nice calming effect).\u00a0\u00a0So keep that in mind as you read this...First was taking 50 mg for years and came off over the space of 1 month.\u00a0\u00a0 Did not really feel the side effects but I did find my sex drive was intense and actually was premature ejeculating for a while (that was really bizarre).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway.... After about 1 month I drifted down, down, down into a deep and ugly depression with anxiety.I went back on Zoloft about 3 months after coming off it.\u00a0\u00a0Climbed as high as 100 mg for a few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Backed off to 87.5 mg and felt okay.\u00a0\u00a0So I thought hey, I can come off this stuff.\u00a0\u00a0Dropped to 75 mg, seemed okay.\u00a0\u00a0Dropped to 62.5 mg and went back into OCD / depression / anxiety.Soooooo.\u00a0\u00a0I am now somewhat stable.\u00a0\u00a0You have to come off VERY slowly.\u00a0\u00a0If you have been on for years, then I would suggest coming off it super slow over a long time.\u00a0\u00a0Seems like you have not much to loose by taking longer than you would guess you need.Hope this is helpful.",

    "question": "I'm a 56 year old male who has been taking Zoloft for about four years for anxiety and stress-related depression.My life is pretty stable right now, my confidence is high, I have a strong faith, and I am trying to slowly get off of Zoloft. Over the last four years I have always taken a minimum of 100MG daily, with some periods as high as 200mg. The last few months I pushed it to 200MG in order to see if that was necessary to create an improvement in my mood. It didn't, so now I have been down to 100MG for about three weeks, My question is twofold. First, how gradual should my reduction be? Second, what are the most common side effects I might expect and how do I get through them?\u00a0\u00a0If it matters at all, I am about 40 pounds overweight and have type II diabetes too. (Ain't life grand?)I appreciate any replies.Zake",
