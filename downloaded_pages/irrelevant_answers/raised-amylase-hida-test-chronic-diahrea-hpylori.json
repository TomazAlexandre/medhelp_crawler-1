            "answer": "hi thanks for the reply,i have had a once or twice pains in the mid section of the stomachhad a gastroscopy once because it was very painful, so im not sure if they were acute attacks on the pancreas, the dr didnt seem too concerned of the raised amylais, will ask dr again about it.Also have noticed that when i drink milk i somtimes get diahrea, for example my stools were getting better i have been off milk for a few weeks and sugar, i lost plenty of weight too, i drank milk last night and had pains and diahrea this morning, what could this suggest? that im allergic to milk maybe?Have had a blood test for coeliac and came back negative, the hida test i was told will test the liver, gallbladder and the small intenstine.im waiting for another test, Flexible Sigmoidoscopy, if one has chronic prostratitis, then does this\u00a0\u00a0test pose a danger, as the drs only asked if ones got diabetes or taking blood thinning medication.thanks again",

    "question": "hijust a question, i had pains i my stomach, dr tested for pancreatitis and it shown up as 135, i was told its very mildly raised, the gastrologist sid, anything can cause it and its nothing? my question was, is it chronic pancreaitis, i was told no, nothing was checked with it I am having a hda scan of the gallbladder includes the liver, also a gastroscopy (whch i have had before and was fine) and a flexible sigmoidoscopy, becaue\u00a0\u00a0of chronic diahrea, which was pale somtimes and greasy, but the pancreas has been totally neglected by the dr.the weird thing is, i started taking probiotic/acidophilis past week and my diahrea seems to be disppeared slowly. i have also been tested positive for h.pylori got the resultsthe other day.could is simply be due to bad bacteria that i had diahrea and the probiotics are helping and could this bad bacteria be h.pylori? also amylase raised at 135 is that of a concern? i have had a history of drinking but only socially about 2 years ago and smoking whic i quit 12 months ago.",
