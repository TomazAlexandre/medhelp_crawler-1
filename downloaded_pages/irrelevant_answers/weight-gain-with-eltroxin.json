            "answer": "You said you are drinking enough water to drown a whale . . . are you craving water and urinating frequently?Reason I'm asking is many thyroid patients also have problems with blood glucose (diabetes or hypoglycemia).\u00a0\u00a0Here are the most frequent warning signs of Type II diabetes:Increased thirst.Increased hunger (especially after eating).Dry mouth.Frequent urination.Recent weight gain.Fatigue (weak, tired feeling.Blurred vision.Headaches.Loss of consciousness (rare).Less frequent symptoms:Slow-healing sores or cuts.Itching of the skin (usually around the vaginal or groin area).Frequent yeast infections.Numbness and tingling of the hands and feet.Decreased vision.Impotency.Since thyroid conditions and diabetes (Type II usually) often go hand-in-hand, please contact your doctor to be tested if you are experiencing these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is a very silent disease and needs to be controlled at the earliest possible stages before serious damage can occur.I know that in the past six weeks, after being on the very restrictive LID diet and going through the holidays, I haven't been good at controlling my carb intake and my blood sugar has been a bit high at times.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say I've put on 8lbs in six weeks, just from not managing the carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Darn those oatmeal raisin cookies!!!\u00a0\u00a0And I'm only classified as \"pre-diabetic\" but my glucose levels can get into the mid 200s without any effort.Please call your doctor and/or invest in a home glucose meter.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and welcome to the \"I've got a messed up endocrine system\" club!\u00a0\u00a0:-)",

It is soooooo depressing, nothing fits and I am super irritated!!So yeah, hopefully Eltroxin would help me loose the weight and NOT gain any more like with you guys.Good luckTake it easy....",

            "answer": "I've been on eltroxin for a number of years, my thyroid was completely removed. I suffered very rapid weight gain as well, but the worst part of it is that I went from being slim and toned to being soft, blubbery and full of cellulite all over my legs (including calves), and arms and stomach. I'm still in my 20's and a very healthy eater - so this isn't the norm. And no exercising has helped, in fact the cellulite appears worse. I've also suffered all the other side effects such as tachycardia and arrythmia, extreme tiredness and blurry vision, confusion, nausea, headaches. And with the heart issues I ended up having to deal with a panic disorder for more than 6 months because my heartbeat was all over the place. I also found my immune system was weakened, and picked up any bug going around. Some of these symptoms have lessened over time, but the weight gain / cellulite seems it's here to stay (very depressing).If any one finds out what we can do to counteract this weight gain caused by the metabolism issues eltroxin creates, such as maybe a herbal remedy we can take - please shout. It can get quite desperate.",

My doctor is monitoring very closely and we keep having to try new meds every few months when the last don't seem to be doing the trick. Since being on eltroxin I'm turning into a whale!! I walk my dog for atleast an hour every morning and also run with him in the afternoon playing in the backyard, yet I can feel all my jeans tightening and my body is getting bigger. Any herbal remedies or advice would be very appreciated.Sincerely,a very depressed, once fit but now self conscious Canadian woman.",
