    "question": "I know everywhere is different so how long you sit for the glucose is different. I'm in Canada and it's 1 hour and if you fail it's 2 hours. I just failed the first hour so I had to do the 2 hour. I got the call saying 2 out of 3 tests were normal. The middle one wasn't. How many of you failed the second test but your doctor still didn't have much concern since only 1 out of 3 came back high. He told me to see a dietitian next week but me to keep eating how I'm eating. He never said anything about medication at all though. Did anyone of you have to go in medication at all or just check your blood",
