            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If a child is really huge for age then pituitary function especially growth hormone should be assessed. You must get your grandson assessed by an endocrine specialist. Swelling of feet too should not be ignored as it can be due to conditions of heart, kidney, liver or low protein or severe anemia. Please consult his PCP for primary examination to rule out all these conditions followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
