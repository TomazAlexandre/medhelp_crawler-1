            "answer": "Hi there,The common causes of hyperactive bowel sounds along with upset stomach and loose stools are food intolerance, irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn\u2019s disease, diarrhea, food allergy, infectious enteritis, ulcerative colitis etc. Most over-the-counter antacids help in soothing a sour stomach and heartburn that may accompany stomach noise. It is important to visit your physician for a thorough physical examination. Depending on the results, diagnostic testing endoscopy, colonoscopy, etc. may be done. Do keep me posted.Best luck and kind regards!",
