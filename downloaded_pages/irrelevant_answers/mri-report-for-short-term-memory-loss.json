            "answer": "Dear Friend,Since you have specified that you don't have Hypertension , Diabetes, Migraine, then in a nutshell\u00a0\u00a0i would recommend you ----------Please change your present doctor.Since there are some signal changes noted (medical terminology), then we need to do further investigation of the same.As rightfully suspected by you (bipolar disorder and high homocystine levels), chances of the same may be related to the signal changes, but presently we really can't comment (especially myself, as i have not examined you fully).This is the sole reason as why i have advised you for meeting/consulting another doctor, as these are really sensitive issues and if the current doctor is not able to address them to you or inform them to you, then you must take a second opinion.Please feel free to discuss this issue further, as i would be glad to help you out of this.Regards",

    "question": "I finally obtained a copy of my MRI report as well as the CD with the actual pics of the MRI (like I could really understand what I was looking at).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, after a lot of blah, blah, blah that I don't understand and that was stated as unremarkable, which is a good thing, these are the things that stood out (which are the only ones I'm typing here:HISTORY:\u00a0\u00a056 yr old female w/short term memory loss, personaility changes; tonic clonic idiopathic seizures; seizure free since 1989.A focus of increased FLAIR and T2 signal is appreciated in the left perifrontal/periventricular white matter measuring approximately 7.5 millimeters in it's maximum dimension.\u00a0\u00a0Smaller lesions are seen in the anterior aspect of the left corona radiata subcortical white matter of the left frontal lobe.There is subtle mucosal thickening in the frontal, sphenoid, bilateral ethmoid and maxillary sinuses.\u00a0\u00a0Mucous retention cyst is present in the right maxillary sinus measuring at least 1.2 cm.IMPRESSION:Abnormal signal foci in the perventricular/perifrontal white matter, anterior corona radiata and subcortical white matter of the frontal lobe on the left wi/out associated mass effect or retractive changes consisten with probable nonspecific demyelination or gliosis.\u00a0\u00a0A contrast enhanced MRI of the brain, however, is recommended for further evaluation.Basically, I have the neurologist from h*ll.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't answer questions, nor does he explain anything.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing my neurologist stated was \"this white matter is indicative of a history of diabetes, migraines or high blood pressure\" - none of which I have.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm left scratching my head wondering what it is.\u00a0\u00a0Since he brushes off any questions I might have, could someone please explain to me what the above means. I don't think it's helpful to me to google certain words to come up with what \"I think\" it means.Please!\u00a0\u00a0Any help someone could give me would be much appreciated.",
