    "question": "In the last few days patches of skin on my legs have become numb and tingly. It happens on both legs, but only lasts a few seconds. This could happen 10-20 times a day. Like a patch of skin on my left leg will become all tingly, feels a bit like goosebumps, that kind of sensatoin, but it disappears within a few seconds. Any ideas? Other info: I went to my doctor about being achey, my muscles ache upon exertion, like I used to be able to run for 45 minutes, but I can't do it any more because my muscles become achey very very quickly. It also hurts to stretch, but they do not hurt to touch. I'm also having a pelvic ultrasound for possible ovarian cyst/endometriosis, my GP thought I have a cyst as my ovary was hard to feel and I have the symptoms of endo/ovarian cyst.",
