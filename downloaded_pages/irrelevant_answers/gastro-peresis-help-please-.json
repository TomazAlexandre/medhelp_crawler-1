    "question": "I am 28 and suffer from severe gastric peresis. I have had a j tube and a gastric pacemaker placed a year ago. I was doing great with the pacer for about a year and have just hit the wall again. I am vomitting at least 10 -15 times a day and also having to take heavy narcotics for the pain. I am wondering or really begging to find out if there are any other treatments I should try ( I am allergic to reglan and domperidone didn't work) I have heard that gastric bypass might be an answer however my surgeon doesn't think it would work. If you have any information will you please email me. at ***@****. Thank you in advance",
