            "answer": "Hello derrell pitts,I have to tell you that I am not a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0I am a volunteer.\u00a0\u00a0My son was diagnosed with type 1 6-1/2 yrs. ago at the age of 3.\u00a0\u00a0My sister wad diagnosed 8 yrs. ago at the age of 24.\u00a0\u00a0She also has type 1.To be completely honest with you, I have not heard of this medication.\u00a0\u00a0Since I am unfamiliar with this type of medication and effects, I do not want to give an \"opinion\" based on my findings from the search engines.I do know that there are many meds that can affect blood sugar, but the loss of consciousness part that you mentioned sounds pretty risky and scary, as well as the shortness of breath.I am going to pass on your question to other volunteers, so you can receive some good input on this topic.\u00a0\u00a0There are several volunteers who are very well-educated medically.My question to you is what does the Endocrinologist treating the patient (you or someone else) have to say about being on coreg??\u00a0\u00a0If the Endo is apprehensive, aren't there other medications to take for high blood pressure?As I mentioned, I will pass your\u00a0\u00a0? on to other volunteers.Take care:0",

            "answer": "I'm also not a physician, but because of your post I did a bit of reading about Coreg.\u00a0\u00a0It's medication used for controlling bp and also for treating heart failure.The prescribing info suggests talking with your doc if the patient is a child or diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Seems important to run this by your endo, at a minimum (I can't tell from your post if you are the person with diabetes or if you're a parent/family member).\u00a0\u00a0As with all bp meds, it's important to take them as prescribed and to *not* stop them abruptly.There are many types of bp meds on the market.\u00a0\u00a0Coreg is in a class called beta blockers.\u00a0\u00a0There are diuretics, alpha blockers, ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor antagonists & calcium channel blockers.\u00a0\u00a0There may be others, too, but these are the ones I know about.\u00a0\u00a0A pharmacist once mentioned to me that the good thing about need bp meds is that there are many of them on the market now.\u00a0\u00a0With all the different classes, it's likely you & your child's docs can find a medication that doesnt' result in the problem side effects you mention.I can't tell from your msg if the side effects are \"just\" what's printed or if you/the patient actually experiences these side effects.\u00a0\u00a0If it's the latter, I would certainly follow up with the docs to find a med that will ease the stress on kidneys without the side effects.Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure this ordeal is frightening.",

    "question": "I am curious as to your opinion regarding the use of coreg for blood pressure control for a juvenile diabetic, with renal problems (37%) function. The coreg causes problems controlling the blood sugar in the patient, and it causes bouts of vomiting and loss of consciousness it also causes very low blood pressures, fatigue and shortness of breath.derrell pitts",
