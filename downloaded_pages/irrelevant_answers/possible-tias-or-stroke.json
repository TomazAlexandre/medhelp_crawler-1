    "question": "I have been diagnosed with Extreme IBS, Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue. But in the last month or so I had been having increasing spells of dizziness. Then one day I had an extreme spell where my I could not get up off the floor, my left leg was numb and tingling, my left arm was tingling, the left side of my face went completely numb. My lips and around the eye were the worst, my speach was slurred, I was confused and feeling very much like I was impared. My eye sight went in my left eye. I felt like someone was slowly shutting off my brain. On the left side of my face I get pressure behind the left eye feeling just like there is a pulsating blood pressure point and it is about to pop. I get headaches sometimes peircing, sometimes not. I do not know if I should be calling them headaches or head hurts? As they are different from a normal headache. These spells come in varying stages, sometimes it is the whole left side of me, sometimes only the face and arm other times just the face. The numbness around the eye and lips never goes away now. They have done a CT scan, and a Carotid Doppler and have found nothing. They are sending me to a neurologist next and I have been fitted with a holter monitor again. They have done blood work on me and it seems fine. Diabetes runs heavily in my family, so do strokes. I used to have very high blood pressure, now it is very very low. I need someone to help me, I am very affraid of these spells and do not know what to do next. Please could someone tell me what to do? I also find that strobing light or intense light makes me dizzy and sick.",
