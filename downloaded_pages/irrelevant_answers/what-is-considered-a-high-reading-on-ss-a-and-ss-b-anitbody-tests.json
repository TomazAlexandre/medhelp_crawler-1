            "answer": "My doctor says this about the test results:\"The numbers do not mean much. If it is positive, then it suggests Sjogren's syndrome. There is no scale for these tests. You cannot compare it to previous numbers since the tests have changed. You will likely be positive indefinitely.\"My first positive test result for Sjogren's was about three years ago. I had other complaints of joint problems that were being investigated then. No Sjogren's symptoms at that time. Recently, I have developed troublesome dry mouth. That is what prompted my most recent tests. Thought I might have diabetes, which I don't, luckily. I have found that drinking excessive amounts of water was making my symptoms worse by rinsing away what little saliva I was producing. I use a straw now, and the Biotene products help a lot.",
