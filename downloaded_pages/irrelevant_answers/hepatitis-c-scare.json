    "question": "I am 7 months pregnant and my dad has hepatitis c as well as diabetes. While at their house last weekend, my dad's sugar was extremely high (@400) and I wasn't thinking and I went to test the accu check machine to make sure that it was accurate.\u00a0\u00a0I changed the lancet to a new one and used a new testing strip.\u00a0\u00a0I did not at any time touch the machine with my drop of blood, I got it directly onto the circle for blood without touching any other part of the machine.\u00a0\u00a0I am very paranoid (or maybe not) that I now have a good chance of getting hep c.\u00a0\u00a0I have not slept for days over this.\u00a0\u00a0I am waiting to get tested on my next ob visit in two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I am waiting because I think that is the first time it would be detectable...So my question is two fold...what is my chance of getting hep c using a new lancet and a new strip and how often and for how long should I get tested? Also, what are the implications for my new baby should I have it?",
