            "answer": "Hi,First, conversion disorder, though could be due to a recent stress, but\u00a0\u00a0its mainly due to a very old stress (e.g childhood abuse mainly a sexual one)..you may feel its not affecting you at a conscous level any more.About the spastic legs..I cant comment because I have not examined you, but if we added to the hyper reflxia + any sensory deficit? then could explaine the tremor of the legs when you try to stand up, simply it could be Clonus or, if you dont have the above signs then,\u00a0\u00a0an Orthostatic tremor ( but you could only be told that for sure, by a physcian who could examine you physically)Your question: I was told that the leg pain was benign neuropathy--where would this be coming from? What underlying cause?It could be a new terminology, so many new names coming up , I've never heard of a benign neuropathy?God blessBob Hilton",

    "question": "I have had a host of oddball symptoms since July of last year, including the following:-Shooting pain starting at the hip and going right down my leg, first on the left side and now on both sides-Tingling in my legs-Numbness in my toes (even when I'm standing up)-Occassional tremor in my legs, sometimes they shake uncontrollably and I can't walk-My leg muscles are really tight (one doctor said somewhat spastic) all the time-My LE reflexes have been described as \"pretty hyper\" (I love these clinical terms)-Bladder issues (Frequency/urgency/needing to urinate every 5 minutes/occ. incontinence)-Tremor in my hands (seems like intentional tremor i.e. only happens when I'm trying to use them-Fatigue-Difficulty concentratingI've blood tests for lots of stuff--B12 fine, sed rate just slightly elevated, WBC fine, no diabetes. Liver function is fine. I'm not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I just had an MRI w/wo contrast--\"no signs of MS\". Dr. did say I had a sinus infection (!). I was told that the leg pain was benign neuropathy--where would this be coming from? What underlying cause?\u00a0\u00a0I'm scheduled to see a neurologist soon.\u00a0\u00a0I want to ask intelligent questions and get to the root of this.\u00a0\u00a0I have already been told once when I presented at my family doctor's with the tremor that it was conversion disorder.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not really buying this.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not under any more stress than most people, and this isn't getting me out of anything unpleasant--it's just making my everyday life mildly to moderately unpleasant.\u00a0\u00a0Being thought to be slightly unhinged isn't helping me.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any ideas?",
