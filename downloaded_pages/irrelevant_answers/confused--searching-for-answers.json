            "answer": "I do have a nasty looking MRI of the cervical spine , and the posts I left on the neurology forum , well the replies say that\u00a0\u00a0i have propable cause for the \"stinging\" & so forth in the cervical maladies. But I was thrown from a horse ( my passion) a couple of months before I broke down and went to the dr. I had read about \"atlano-axial ligament tears\" and wonered if this could be the cause. The chiropractor I went to had an xray that showed my atlas out of level to the right, he popped it back in and the symptoms seemed to go away. Maybe it was psycosomatic . but I sure do crunch a lot in my neck.This , I do belive, does not negate the fact that I'm bipolar. But can bipolar really cause numbness etc etc etc. ? If I knew for sure my neck wasnt gonna put me in a wheelchair, I'd ride again , . As I think about being thrown from my butt being 6-7' in the air flat on my back , would indicate my neck couldnt be that bad.",

    "question": "I have been posting on the neurology forum due to my symptoms of numbness & tingling all over my body . I do have an abnormal MRI. I have seen a surgeon and he says he can see where the numbness could affect my arms but not my whole body. I finally broke down and went to a Psychiatrist. I was diagnosed as \"classic , textbook bipolar. I have taken zoloft for years now, but he changed me to Cymbalta & added depakote.My questions are;1) can the manic side , when under extreme stress, really cause such symptoms?2) if so, how long before the meds will take to diminish or completely alleviate these awful symptoms.As a side note , I have dealt with these symptoms off and on since I was 26, and no one can really understand where they come from . Everything from diabetes to MS has been ruled out.",
