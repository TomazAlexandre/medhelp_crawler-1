            "answer": "Obviously, you were living a typical sedentary lifestyle. You were accumulating all the risk factors to develop not only heart disease, but also hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes..no need to mention everything.Junky food and overweight and sitting. You are lucky you are still young and developed only dizziness.To explain it simply, your heart got used to your lack of movement and became \u201clazy\u201d, not pumping enough part to your brain, causing you to feel dizzy.Going to the gym will improve your heart and general condition. Don\u2019t try to train yourself without supervision. This may have a reverse effect on your heart and would develop a lethal condition commonly found in young people who trained themselves forcefully and named \u201chypertrophic cardiomyopathy\u201d. Many people had this condition undiagnosed and died suddenly.Always start with light training, and walk. There\u2019s nothing that improves someone\u2019s health like walking.If you need to know anything else just ask. I will be glad to answer you as much as I can.",

    "question": "Ok.. i don't work out..at all.. i eat well.. mostly junk food and im on the computer a lot.. like.. 9 hours a day. oh btw im 17 years old.I know your probably thinking woah what a life.. yeah i know pretty crappy but come this summer im going to be changing all this.. im going to be working out at the gym every other day and use the computer a lot less.By the way i have been living like this for about 4 years.Now here is my question.Is it possible that over time my heart has stopped pumping as much blood? im always slightly dizzy and i get lightheaded very quickly and easily.I have gained a lot of weight in the past few years. im 5'10 180lbsSo do you think my heart is to blame for me being dizzy?\u00a0\u00a0Sorry if this sounds crazy but in my mind it kinda makes a lot of scene but hey..im not a doctor nor do i know anything about this kinda stuff..Thanks.",
