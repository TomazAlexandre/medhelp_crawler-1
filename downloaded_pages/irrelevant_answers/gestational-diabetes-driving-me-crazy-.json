            "answer": "They should have given you a thing to test you sugar levels. Sugar levels should not be below 3.5 and should not be over 6.7, i have it written in a book i was given! I have GD aswell, i know how you feel and i'm skinny too (with a baby bump). I was told to exercise, watch what i eat and test my sugar levels before breakfast and 2 hours after breakfast, lunch and dinner. I was also told that even if your doing everything right and still need insulin, it's not your fault and don't beat yourself up over it. Message me if you want to talk :)",

            "answer": "In my experience, insulin has been a relief to me. I can eat what is normal and healthy for my baby (not cakes and cookies, but balanced and healthy servings of whole grains, beans, etc). I don't feel terrible from blood sugar highs and lows. I can understand your reluctance, I had it too at first. It's hard to accept that your body isn't functioning as it should. But insulin doesn't cross the placenta and the shots are not really that bad at all (not as annoying as the constant blood sugar testing!). If you alter your perspective a little, it might make you more comfortable. Good luck :-)",

    "question": "I need answers as to what to do about my blood sugar levels. I am 32 weeks pregnant and tested positive for gestational diabetes. They put me on a diet that's driving me crazy.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I barely eat anything for a meal and my blood sugar level comes so high. For instance I ate a quarter bowl of rice with a grilled pork chop and lots of steamed vegetables for dinner and walked after my meal and my blood sugar level was 9.7. Has anyone had this problem?\u00a0\u00a0I really do not want to take insulin. I am also very petite and haven't been putting on pounds since I started this diet.",
