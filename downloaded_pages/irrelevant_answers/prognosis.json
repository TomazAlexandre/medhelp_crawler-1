            "answer": "For prognosis regarding the symptoms in your hands, consider an EMG. As for the repaired vertebra, we usually recommend no heavy lifting or strenuous activity for the first 6 weeks or until your first followup appointment. After that, theoretically you should be able to return to your life prior to the injury. A history of diabetes or serious medical conditions can hamper the recovery period, but otherwise 6-8 weeks is the time period we give our patients following major spine surgery.",

            "answer": "obviously you also misunderstood the kind recommendation.\u00a0\u00a0To post 2 questions on one day is a misuse and I kindly offered this information to the first time poster.\u00a0\u00a0And it is not true the doctors do indeed read a comment posted so closely to the originally posted question particularly if it hasn't been answered already by one of the staff doctors.\u00a0\u00a0If you want to check this out you kind find numerous posts that other patients had no room to type more pertinent info and continued on with posting a comment right after that.\u00a0\u00a0It's absolute nonsense for you to say that the doctors don't read that.\u00a0\u00a0True the poster can be lucky to have had to post 2 questions in one day however the question should have been well thought out prior to wasting another post slot.",

Is there any danger of my injuring\u00a0\u00a0the c5,6,7 site again ? Can I go back to normal life after healing period is done ? I am 63 years old and just retired and looking forward to playing with my grandchildren and teaching swimming to 3-5 year old children at the local YMCA",
