    "question": "I have a teenage daughter that has been having trouble since the first week of August 2011 with getting dizzy and passing out. We have had 5 emergency room visits, where they have tested, each time, for pregnacy, diabetes, infections, ekg's, every time we have left after hours of tests with no answers. We have had her to our family doctor, who has had her get an echocardiogram, and wore a heart monitor for 72 hours, still nothing found. We have been scheduled to go get test done that test the bodies electical whatever, not sure what it's called. We are scared for her, and frustrated that we can't find out what is wrong. Last night around bed time, my wife and I heard a loud bump, and just thought it was our daughter cleaning her room, but a couple minutes later I found her passed out on the livingroom floor, the sound we heard was her hitting the floor....",
