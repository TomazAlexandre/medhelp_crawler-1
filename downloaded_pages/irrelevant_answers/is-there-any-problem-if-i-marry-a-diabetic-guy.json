            "answer": "Hi rinky~ all I can say is that I'm diabetic and have been since I was 23 following the birth of my daughter. That is 46 years ago now. Hard to believe it's been that long. I've had my share of ups and downs but mostly because at first, diabetes was extremely hard to accept. But once I knew how to take care of myself, life became 'normal' again. meaning that 2 shots a day were routine just like brushing your teeth:) As the years passed, I was put on an insulin pump which has opened my life up to many good things such as: not worrying about what time I eat my meals because with the pump, you are able to regulate how much insulin is needed for each occasion whether snacking or eating a meal. The two comments before mine are excellent recommendations. Good luck to you. My husband didn't care that I was diabetic and is extremely supportive to me:) His uncle has it and is familiar with diabetes.",
