            "answer": "According to the National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse\"\"The most common cause of chronic pancreatitis is many years of heavy alcohol use. The chronic form of pancreatitis can be triggered by one acute attack that damages the pancreatic duct. The damaged duct causes the pancreas to become inflamed. Scar tissue develops and the pancreas is slowly destroyed.\"You can't live without your pancreas, so if it's destroyed, the end result will not be a happy one. I imagine it depends on the extent of the damage as to how much longer a person will live, not to mention each persons individual resilience.The Pancreatic Disease Centre states -\"Oral pancreatic enzyme supplements are utilized to aid in the digestion of food. Patients who develop diabetes require insulin to control the blood sugar. It is important to remember that no treatment will help relieve your pain if you drink alcohol. A diet low in fat is necessary and sometimes it is easier for the patient to eat more frequently in much smaller portions. The doctor may recommend surgery to relieve abdominal pain, to restore drainage of pancreatic secretions, or to reduce the frequency of attacks.\"",

            "answer": "I don't understand why you haven't been hospitalized if your pancreatic enzymes in your blood tests showed your pancreas is inflamed. The only treatment for it is to be on IVs and nothing by mouth until it heals. That can only be done in the hospital. I had pancreatitis and was hospitalized for 8 days before the enzymes were low enough for me to leave. They did stay just above normal for two more weeks. Perhaps your enzyme level isn't high enough to require treatment yet. I would keep up on this and see your doctor again soon if the pain continues.",
