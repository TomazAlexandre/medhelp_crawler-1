            "answer": "Hi Sky.205 sounds outrageously high for a serum creatinine level. Normal levels for an adult male ranges from .6 to 1.3 mg/dL. Typically people with greater muscle mass fall toward the higher side. I think your number is measured in micromol/L. If this is correct, take your number 205 and divide it by 88.4 to convert to mg/dL. This gives us a number of 2.31 mg/dL which is still high. A few thoughts....Your UA makes me think that you do have some degree of kidney damage as well as uncontrolled diabetes. Typically sugar is not seen in the urine until blood sugars reach 200+ mg/dL. As a diabetic you are at risk for diabetic nephropathy, a kidney disease which is a complication of having persistantly high blood sugar levels. Docors ususally test for this by measuring microalbumin (which is a protein) in the urine. If this lab value becomes elevated, your doctor will typically start you on an ACE inhibitor, which will help slow the progression of diabetic nephropathy, along with good control of blood sugars. If you are having trouble maintaining good blood sugar levels, I suggest you go to your doctor and rework your medication and diabetes control plan. Keeping your sugars under control is crucial.~bk",
