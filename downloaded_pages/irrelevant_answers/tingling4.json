            "answer": "Hello,Such tingling feeling can be due to diabetes, vitamin B 12 deficiency, peripheral vascular disease, thyroid and neurological and spinal causes like carpal tunnel syndrome. Even thyroid disease can cause such symptoms. We need to confirm the diagnosis by getting your blood sugar levels, EKG heart, thyroid function tests, vitamin B 12 levels and a neurological examination from a neurologist done.You should eat a healthy diet consisting more of meat and non veg products which are rich sources of vitamin B 12. If you are a vegetarian then you can take vitamin B 12 supplements after consulting your physician.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
