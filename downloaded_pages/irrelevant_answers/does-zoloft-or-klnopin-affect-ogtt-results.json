            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, Zoloft can have an effect on the blood sugar level but at higher doses. Discuss with your doctor before stopping this drug for blood sugar testing. Please do not stop the drug on your own. Repeat the blood sugar testing and see the result. If the values persist, you could be having hypoglycemia. Also if the dose is low, then also it would be wise to repeat the test and inform the Lab that you are on Zoloft. Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!Excessive alcohol intake, hepatitis, kidney disease, certain medications, disorders of adrenal gland etc can all cause hypoglycemia. It can also be caused by poor eating patterns. Rarely is it caused by insulin secreting tumors called insulinomas. These can secrete huge amounts of insulin after food and a person can suffer from hypoglycemia despite eating. You could be having this. On the other hand it could be Zoloft exacerbating the hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemic effect has been documented even at 50 mg dose. So please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!",
