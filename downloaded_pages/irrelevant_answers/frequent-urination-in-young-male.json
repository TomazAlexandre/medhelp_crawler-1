            "answer": "Yes he's been tested and has no stds. and there is no pain or discomfort when peeing. No blood in the urine, and he always pees the normal amount. It's not like he feels the need to pee but then can't, or only pees a little. It's always just like a normal pee, but it happens so frequently.",

            "answer": "Does he seem thirsty often? Has he had his blood sugar checked for diabetes?Does he go during the night?\u00a0\u00a0Does he seem to drink water constantly and cannot go anywhere without water?\u00a0\u00a0If so, it could be diabetes insipidus, which is VERY different than diabetes mellitis (Type 1 or Type 2).If not, then it could be a number of things, such as an enlarged prostrate or something else impinging on the bladder and creating a sensation of needing to go, even if the bladder is empty. It could be a problem with the nerves or muscles that connect to and control the bladder. It could also be related to the hernia.This is worth going to a doctor for. Can he find a subsidized or free clinic to get it checked out?",

            "answer": "Sorry, just realized you already mentioned he was tested for diabetes. I encourage you to look up diabetes insipidus, though, just to see if that seems fit his symptoms.I would put my bets on the hernia...that when he lies down, it moves in a way that rubs a nerve or a muscle that is interpreted as a need to pee.",

            "answer": "Well it's not just the urge to pee, he actually pees. And when it flares up, he pees way more than his liquid intake which throws me off. I will look up the diabetes you are talking about though. Thank you.",

            "answer": "Yeah, a visit to the doctor sounds good. One last thought...diuretics can make a person pee more than their intake. Some medications can cause this as well as coffee, Coca Cola, and other drinks.",
