            "answer": "I, too, was told to eat nuts and peanut butter after being Dx with GD.\u00a0\u00a0What disturbs me is that what Christie posted states that we should avoid especially peanuts if any of us (immediate family) have been allergic to anything.\u00a0\u00a0Does this mean that if we do eat peanuts that we put our unborn babies at risk for developing this horrible allergy?\u00a0\u00a0It's bad enough that they are already at a higher risk for developing Type 2 Diabetes.Legume allergies are even more severe than other anaphalactic reactions and result in death often.\u00a0\u00a0One of the problems with this particular allergy is that many foods are made with and cooked in peanut oil which can produce the same results.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes even asking at a restaurant doesn't yield the answers necessary to save your life.\u00a0\u00a0So be hyper-vigilant about knowing what you are eating.Thank you, Christie.\u00a0\u00a0I would never have even been aware of this if not for your information.Regards,Shelly",

Just because \"morning sickness\" pretty much goes hand in hand during the first few months of pregnancy, it doesn't mean it has to happen.\u00a0\u00a0My son is now 5, but when I was pregnant with him, I NEVER threw up, not a single time.\u00a0\u00a0I was pretty happy because like you, I was not in to the whole morning sickness thing... Hope you skip out on it just as I did... and Best of luck.LeAnne",

I was told that the fats in nuts are super healthy, especially for developing brains, and are an excellent choice for a snack. I was also told that blueberries, legumes, yogurt, and low sugar orange juice should also be frequent in my diet while pregnant.",
