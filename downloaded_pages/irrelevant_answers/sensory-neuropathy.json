            "answer": "Dear Michele:A sensory neuropathy with a distribution of hands and feet is classic for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Even if the diabetes is well controlled, this is often seen.\u00a0\u00a0Just from your posting, I would say that this is likely the etiology.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the medications for AIDS can induce a peripheral neuropathy that can have sensory components.\u00a0\u00a0Alcoholism can also induce a periperal neuropathy that can be very painful.\u00a0\u00a0I would think that poor circulation would be last on the list of possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0Most likely the poor circulation is due to the above also.The circulation induce neuropathy would have to be extremely severe in nature.\u00a0\u00a0You would likely to first have to loose the hair in the extremities and see an almost necrotic lesions at the finger and toes.\u00a0\u00a0Frost bite would a close example.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Thank you for responding to my question.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to make sure that I understand your response.\u00a0\u00a0If a person has a lower extremity circulation problem with an ABI of about .80 and absent pulses, but no visible lesions, no ulcers, no hair loss in the area, and waves that show blood is going to all the toes, if I understand correctly, this would never be a severe enough condition to create a neuropathy in that extremity?\u00a0\u00a0Is that correct?\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry to bother you but I just want to make sure I understand since I thought that even a mild circulation problem could cause a neuropathy.Thank you,Michele",

            "answer": "You mentioned medication causes. Since you speak on this forum of that and viral etiologies what are your thoughts on a drug/viral interaction bringing on sensory neuropathy that is then worsened by the use of steriods.. Do such viral/drug syndromes burn out eventually or can they last indefinitely?",

            "answer": "I remember the Dr saying in one of my questions regarding post viral, and I think he said it is usually self limiting.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure about the drug induced ones though, I guess as long as no permanent damage has been done as soon as the drug is stopped?",

            "answer": "to GT.I was speaking to antigen/antibody drug/viral interactions which can be worsened by steriods that depress the immune system.These do not show up in antibody testing unless you do the tests early on into the problem.\u00a0\u00a0The sensory neuropathy and other symptoms progress but by the time you have the testing this would not show up. Even though you stop the medications it has already triggered something.\u00a0\u00a0The question was do these type of syndromes burn out or do they go forever like some autoimmune diseases? I imagine some do some don't just wondered what the general consensus was by the Neuro on this type of syndrome.",

    "question": "I have sensory neuropathy in my left foot and both of my hands. I believe it is due to poor circulation.\u00a0\u00a0I have pain but I am experiencing no other abnormalities in terms of loss of sensation, weakness, lack of muscle strength or changes in proprioception.\u00a0\u00a0I see the usual causes of this problem as being diabetes, AIDS, alcoholism, and the effects of medication.\u00a0\u00a0But I think that I have mine because of poor circulation in my hands and feet.When sensory neuropathy is due to poor circulation what is usually the progression that is seen in patients? Also, is there any way that the underlying cause can be treated?\u00a0\u00a0Any information you can give me would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank youMichele",
