    "question": "Today for the first time I noticed oily droplets on the surface of my urine.\u00a0\u00a0They were clear colored, and the urine itself was a normal pale yellow with no solid matter.\u00a0\u00a0I am a bit concerned as to why this occured.\u00a0\u00a0I am not taking any medication, have no known liver or kidney problems and am an active 19 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0I had two minor bladder infections over 6 months ago, though the first one I believe was due to the improper use of a menstrual cup.\u00a0\u00a0I was eating a relatively high protein diet for a few months, since I am an active athlete and was looking to lose a few pounds.\u00a0\u00a0However, during the past month or two I have decreased my protein consumption to an estimated 55-70 grams/day.\u00a0\u00a0I am also trying to figure out if I have any food allergies, since my digestion has been a bit odd for the past few months.I don't know if the urine is related to the kidneys, or perhaps diet allergies are involved as well.\u00a0\u00a0It may be too early to make a diagnosis, but if you have any knowledge or ideas about what this may be a symptom of, please let me know.",
