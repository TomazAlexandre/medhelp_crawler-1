            "answer": "Hi, I think it's great that your senior girl is eating well and active, but I really do think she needs blood work to see what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0I think she either has early kidney disease going on and/or overactive thyroid(hyperthyroid).\u00a0\u00a0Both of these conditions are very manageable when caught early.That $400 blood work is very high!!!\u00a0\u00a0A full senior blood panel here in VA is about $150.\u00a0\u00a0Please call around and ask about a senior blood panel that includes the thyroid test.\u00a0\u00a0And, if you have limited income you can call the local SPCA or humane societies-they offer discounted services.Best wishes!",

            "answer": "Hi VK,You and Twinbee\u00a0\u00a0DO have a lot in common with your \"Golden Girls\". .Wouldn't it be great if they had little \"Cat Senior Homes\" where you could take them to meet other seniors, play bingo, and maybe meet that special elder gentleman to spend the rest of their Golden years.Think about it!\u00a0\u00a0It would be a riot---they could all take the bus to go Catfood shopping and they would be with thier contemporaries, so they would know it is ok to be a little too thin, and not have your fur done.AAHHH!\u00a0\u00a0In a perfect world, eh?Congratulations on having senior citizens. It is only\u00a0\u00a0reflection of the good care and love you 2 have shown them.Sincerely,CML",
