            "answer": "Hi.Firstly, we need to establish that this is indeed acne. A generalized acne may need further evaluation. Differentials for this will be a viral rash or a folliculitis. However, if it involves most parts of your body then you may need further evaluation on this.Do you have any underlying disease condition like diabetes?Have you been taking any immunosuppressants such as corticosteroids?As for the compulsive masturbation, this is something which may require a referral to a therapist. A psychiatrist may be able to help you with this .This condition has a psychological basis and deeper issues need to be tackled here. Professional help may be needed to help you through this as compulsive behaviors may underlie underlying psychogenic factors.Are you under a lot of stress lately?Any problems at work or at home?",
