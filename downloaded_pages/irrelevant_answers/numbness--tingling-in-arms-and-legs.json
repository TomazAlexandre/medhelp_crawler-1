I can't afford getting checked out much less a bunch of tests without it.I was taking vitamins daily when the problem came up, though lately i haven't been. But i doubt it's that.I was thinking a pinched nerve at first when it was in my arms. But what nerve would affect my hands and feet?Thanks for the reply!",

    "question": "It started with my left elbow going numb sometimes at night and pain throughout the day, after some rest that went away for the most part. Shortly after it started in my right elbow, so i rested it like the other arm which stopped the pain in my elbow but brought it into my wrists. First my right, then my left. I will wake up with the right side of my right hand numb all the time and chronic pain in both wrists. I am now getting tingling in my toes and feet with ankle pain the comes and goes. My knees are weak and hurt when i sit/stand. I also have weird muscle twitches under my skin pretty much all over.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 20 year old male, 6'1,\u00a0\u00a0weighing about 200-210 lbs.What could this be? I do not have health insurance and cannot afford to see a doctor without it.",
