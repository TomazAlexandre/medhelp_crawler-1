            "answer": "This is not the doctor's forum. You have to goto expert forum for that.I can answer your question tho, there is no relationship between genital warts and HIV. That is like asking what are the chances of people who has been diagnosed with a cold have diabetes? See what I mean? Don't worry.As for as i know ( from the researches i have done and the information given by doctors on this forum) all suggest that passing HPV to your unborn baby is REALLY rare. However, u should really discuss with your gyno about this. They should help you.Trust me, so many people have HPV and if this is a huge problem in regards to infecting our children im sure there will be more discussion out there about it.But, lastly, again, also consult your doctor and don't assume anything.",
