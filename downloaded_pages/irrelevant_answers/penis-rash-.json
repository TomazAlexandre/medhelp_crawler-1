            "answer": "Hi,It is possible for a man to contract a genital yeast infection if he has unprotected sexual contact with a partner who has a genital yeast infection. However, sexual transmission of yeast infections is uncommon.In men, prolonged antibiotic use, presence of\u00a0\u00a0diabetes or impaired immune systems increases the risk of a yeast infection. Signs and symptoms of a male yeast infection include a reddish rash, and\u00a0\u00a0itching or burning at the tip of the penis. Most male yeast infections are easily treated with an over-the-counter antifungal treatment, such as Monistat.\u00a0\u00a0If the rash persists, it would be best to have it evaluated further by your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0It is important that you and your partner both be treated to prevent reinfection.Take care and keep us posted.",
