            "answer": "I think it would be best to go and get a scan done.do u not have any hospital apts at all?if ur baby is measuring well above average size then by right u need to have a scan. U could be at risk for gestational diabetes or other complications.get your blood type checked too.if u are rhesus neg that can cause complications too.u need to organise this as soon as possible.i was told at my 32wk scan that my baby is far too big and i also have alot of fluid than i should.i have been tested for diabetes and i dont have it so it means im at high risk for other complications.i dont want to worry u but it os possible u could be at risk for pre-term labour (before 37wks) get yourself checked out properly by scan and a proper place.dont let the weeks pass.better safe than sorry. Best of luck.",

The other hospital i used wen i visited my mom @23weeks the midwife there told me if i felt contractions i should go straight to hospital not any clinic cos i won't have my baby @any clinic, wen enquired further she just said to do that way. I have been tested for hypertension,epilepsy, diabetis, cardiac, tb, rpr, rs, tpha, rvd,hb,rpr, rh to mention a few, all sort of risks were tested n all were negative, they kept on testing me on every check-up but nothing has changed, even this last visit everything is still negative",

    "question": "This is our first baby. So i went to see my midwife @33weeks and she told me that my belly was way too big for my dates, there are no scanners b/c its a public local clinic, they only do sound checks(heartbeat). She also said i should not come bek for a check-up until my 40th week and i've never done any scan. So i dont know what to think of this, could this mean early labour? Could it be that its twins/triplets( have twins in family)? Baby too big? Am so confused cos we have no doctors who do scans around this area, i'have to go 4 6hrs trip to and another 6hrs from a city where scans r done.",
