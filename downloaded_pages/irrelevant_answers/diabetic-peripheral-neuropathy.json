            "answer": "Thanks for posting this link.\u00a0\u00a0This drug looks very promising.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is they will find this also helpful for neuropathy outside diabetes so it well may hold potential for many people.On the same page was a reference to another article linking high triglycerides to neuropathy in diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0I found this of interest too.\u00a0\u00a0While I am not diabetic, I seem to have a familial combined hyperlipidemia and very high triglycerides.\u00a0\u00a0I am developing neuropathy in my feet and am seeing someone about this in a few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 I just think so much is intertwined.\u00a0\u00a0Especially since I recently found out my free T3 is low.\u00a0\u00a0Low thyroid also promotes high cholesterol... so getting as much in order as I can will go a long ways I think.Anyway thanks for posting!

            "answer": "Marie,Thanks for pointing that reference out, I need to go read that!\u00a0\u00a0I, too, have hereditary high triglycerides!\u00a0\u00a0Are you taking medication for it?\u00a0\u00a0I'm on simvastatin (zocor).\u00a0\u00a0I think my levels are in the normal range now that I'm on medication.\u00a0\u00a0I can't remember, have you had a QSART?\u00a0\u00a0Mine was a little abnormal, so I want to see if I can get a skin biopsy next time I'm at Cleveland Clinic to assess small fiber neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0If symptoms are any indication, I think things in that aspect have been getting worse for me since I had my testing done over a year ago.My thyroid levels have only been abnormal once, and since they went back to normal it's not something we've really paid attention to.Does diabetes run in your family at all?\u00a0\u00a0Type II diabetes runs VERY heavily on my mother's side of the family, so I'm concerned that that's sort of a ticking time bomb for me.-Heiferly.",

    "question": "Here's some news from the front lines (the bleeding edge of research, so to speak) on diabetic peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0This may be relevant to a few of our community members so I thought it would be appropriate to share:http://www.physorg.com/news203337267.htmlI do not know if there might be any implications from this research on other forms of peripheral neuropathy.",
