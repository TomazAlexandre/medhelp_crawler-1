            "answer": "I am a female who was diagnosed at age 12. I am now in my middle years, and I think something like this could be a great support for teen girls. I would suggest that you go to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation web site (www.jdrf.org) and send an e-mail through the \"newly diagnosed\" link. State what you have stated here, and that you would like to hear from some other teens, for there are some cyber-volunteers who answer these questions who are amazing teens. One of them may be able to put you in contact with others. You may need to be sensitive to the fact that young teens will have security issues -- you may need to make your e-mail address available to them so that they can contact you rather than having you do the contacting. But a person involved with JDRF in a teen outreach situation may be able to pass your information along to others in case they wish to contact you.You could also contact the JDRF website if you want some input from folks like myself who live happily and have come to terms with life as diabetic women. I could see some teens being encouraged by hearing about women who have married and had children, women who have managed successful careers, etc. with diabetes or been active in sports.",

Also thank you for the offer for layout help, but I'm actually a graphic design major and this is my final design project so I think I have that area covered! I appreciate all the suggestions, I wish I could make it for guys too but I only have a little over a month to finish it so the first issues will just be for girls due to time constraints. I hope to continue this even after I graduate this semester so hopefully I will have a chance to expand it, and start a corresponding web site. Thanks again!",

And we think your idea is good!Kristal thinks that there should be something like a \"forum\" for people who don't have access to the internet and a page where readers can send in poems, pictures, etc... She'd also like to see recipes (main meals and healthy snacks - \"normal\" ones and hypo ideas) and ideas for medic-alert bracelets (eg making the bracelet yourself, and attaching the medic-alert to it), how to educate your friends about diabetes (including ideas like inviting the friends over to your house so that they can see how it fits into your life), how to educate your teachers about diabetes, how to explain to other people the difference between type 1 and type 2 diabetes...I would rather not display either hers or my email address on this site, so could you please post your email address?ThanksIsobel",

What a wonderful thing you are doing for your sister and all of the teen girls dealing with this disease. There are so many possible issues that should be covered and this kind of positive support is something that will be well recieved and helpful. I checked out your website and was very impressed. I can't wait to see it's progression. I am sure you will be seeing many response's from the teens (and adults) from JDRF.Please keep in touch. Congratulations!dm",

    "question": "I am a student at San Francisco State university and I am creating a magazine for teen girls with Type 1 Diabetes for my senior thesis project. My sister was diagnosed when she was 5 and now that she's 13, things are getting more difficult. I decided that a magazine aimed specifically at teen girls with diabetes might be helpful. It is going to be almost like a fashion magazine covering issues like eating disorders to politics but in a way that is interesting and accessable. It will also include less serious issues like creative ways to wear a pump, since I know it can really be a struggle to wear a pump fashionably! I would like it to be comprised of contributions from diabetic teens, giving them a forum to discuss issues with eachother, and special place to show their art, writing, and whatever they would like to share. If you are, or know a teenage girl with diabetes, I would love any kind of input on the subject. Ideas, or if you'd like to be invloved. Eventually I would like to get this published.Let me know what you think!",
