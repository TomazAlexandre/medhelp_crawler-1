            "answer": "Yes, you need to see your doctor - your symptoms could be a sign of diabetes (even the persistent thrush).\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest making an immediate appointment and request that they do not only a CBC to check your current blood sugar levels, but also an A1c test that will show what your blood sugar levels have been doing over a period of time.\u00a0\u00a0The A1c is important because sometimes with the CBC it may only show a slightly elevated blood sugar, but the A1C may show that your levels have actually been higher over a period of time - and that's when problems with diabetes tend to appear.\u00a0\u00a0An elevated blood sugar level now and then isn't as much of a problem (still not a good thing), but when they are elevated over a period of time, it can do more damage.Best of luck and please keep us posted.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The first thing to be ruled out is diabetes. The other possibility is hyperthyroid states and worms in the gut. All can keep you hungry 24x7. Though a rare disorder, pancreatic insulinomas should also be thought of in your case and have someone check your blood sugar while you have an anxiety *** hunger attack. The hypoglycemia in this is transient and there is a quick increase in blood glucose once you eat. It can also be severe acidity. However since you have thrush, diabetes should be ruled out first.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Take care!",
