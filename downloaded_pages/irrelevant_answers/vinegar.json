            "answer": "Dear Lango,i haven't heard of using vinegar medicinally for diabetes. i am a type 1 diabetic and don't make my own insulin and injectic it with an insulin pump, so i don't know if vinegar would be beneficial for insulin resistance as what is the cause of type two. One thing to look at is if there are any other changes you have made since starting this regimen. i hope others can give you better advice than i'm capable of. Glad to hear you're taking such good care of your diabetes, bret",

            "answer": "I'm also a volunteer and not a medical professional or nutritionist.\u00a0\u00a0I have read that adding acidic foods to one's meal can help with metabolizing meals better.I found an article that discusses the impact of vinegar, specifically, on the poast-meal (post-prandial) BGs for Type 2.http://www.defeatdiabetes.org/Articles/insulinsensitivity040112.htmApparently, vinegar improves insulin sensitivity.\u00a0\u00a0Many Type 2s suffer from poor insulin sensitivity and if you're among them then your results seems to bear out what this research reported.\u00a0\u00a0There are Type 1s who are also less sensitive to insulin (overweight Type 1s and/or folks experiencing different hormonal changes).\u00a0\u00a0This research did not evaluate sensitivity for Type 1s.Your fasting numbers are terrific and so your routine is serving you well.\u00a0\u00a0Do discuss your finding with your doc to make sure that the vinegar isn't getting in the way of any other meds or conditions that affect you.Thanks for sharing your results.",
