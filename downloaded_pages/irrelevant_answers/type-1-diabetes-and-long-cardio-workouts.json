            "answer": "I know of other type 1 diabetics who do strenuous exercise using the pump. These folks simply turn off their pumps while exercising to avoid lows. If using shots, you can't do that, but you may need to lower your pre-workout insulin levels some. My twin's doctor recommends sports drink such as Gatorade for active diabetics because it replenishes more than just carbs and it is absorbed into the body quicker than juice alone, so you might think about switching from juice to sports drink. It is obvious that you are burning those carbs and need them, so I would think that you may need to lower insulin before exercise so less insulin is working on those carbs.",

            "answer": "I mentioned the pump in my first response because I know of folks who can simply turn theirs off entirely when exercising and this does help simplify the problem of dropping too low when doing strenuous exercise. However, that doesn't mean that a pump is a cure-all. I personally do not use a pump, and maintain a barely-above-non-diabetic a1c level that has not wavered at all since I started my current insulin regimen of Lantus and Novolog. So this is my personal preference -- in my case a pump cannot improve control since control is optimal right now with insulin injections. But the reality is that the Lantus is working 24 hours per day after injection and you can't completely turn that off like you can a pump.Glucose tablets may indeed be a wonderful solution for long exercise, partly because you can carry lots of them with you without having lots of baggage. That's my primary problem with Gatorade (which also absorbs very quickly) -- you have to carry it with you.",

            "answer": "I am in agreement with both sides of the coin on this. For starters you ARE overcompensating for your lows. The extra carbs are contradicting all of the exercise that you're doing.\u00a0\u00a0The glucose tablets are a great low cal way to add 15 carbs without all of the extra carbs. I have been diabetic for almost 10 years, 1/2 on injections and half on a pump. Due to my active lifestyle and eating habits, I prefer the pump because I had too much variability on injections, so that was my personal choice. When I work out I suspend my pump to prevent lows and I will normally have a light snack (only if my sigar is below 100) before I exercise. It might be beneficial for you to seek the advice of a dietician to plan your meals accordingly. The one thing about injections for me, was I can't eat at the same tiem everyday and workout\u00a0\u00a0in that manner, which is why injections didn't work for me. It has to be a consistent routine without a lot of variation. Hope this helps you",

            "answer": "I have been a type 1 diabetic for 40 years. I have to agree that the pump is not the answer to all problems. I was on the pump for two years and my a1c's did not change from the time I was on injections. My a1c's are usually 6.2. If your sugars are dropping during workouts you should not take any insulin for approx. 1 1/2 or 2 hour before working out. I have to add that the cost of pump supplies is rediculous 6500.00 for a 4 month supply. I think you should talk to your diatician",

            "answer": "You obviously weren't using the pump correctly since you preferred injections, but whatever, you're right, that's your preference and your right.If you have insurance, the pump is no more expensive than injections and 9 times out of 10 provide TIGHTER control simply because you can give yourself more exact dosages and calculate correction boluses more accurately.Let me ask you this:\u00a0\u00a0Your target BG is 100mg/dL and you just checked your BG and it's 166mg/dL - how much insulin do you give yourself to bring it down to target?\u00a0\u00a0If your correction bolus ratio is 1u:40mg/dL, how much insulin do you give yourself?\u00a0\u00a0Do you take out a calculator and a magnifying glass for the syringe or something?\u00a0\u00a0Pumps calculate the EXACT dosage needed - no more no less... it's hard to measure 1.65u of insulin in a syringe, isn't it?Also, do you know how much insulin you have on board?\u00a0\u00a0Do you write down in a log the exact time and amount of insulin you give yourself and then consult it when you go to give yourself another bolus or something?\u00a0\u00a0If you still have .35u of insulin in your body from, say, a meal bolus a couple of hours ago, your pump will automatically suggest a reduced bolus of 1.3u instead of 1.65u.I love my insulin pump.. I have such tighter control now that I'm on it.\u00a0\u00a0I just can't understand how anyone could still prefer injections to it (unless the person is uninsured and it's a cost issue).",

            "answer": "Yes, I would research the pump for this problem since your workouts are long.\u00a0\u00a0If you're using a long acting insulin such as Lantus, it's providing you a steady stream of basal insulin all day non-stop.\u00a0\u00a0With the pump, it supplies you with custom hourly basal rates that you can adjust.. so instead of one injection that lasts 24hrs, it will give you 1u or so per hour.\u00a0\u00a0Because of this, when you take the pump off, your basal is therefore stopped...\u00a0\u00a0I am also very active - when I go hiking or practice Muay Thai I simply take my pump off and never have a problem since there is no insulin being delivered during that time.\u00a0\u00a0You can eat and drink all you want, but with insulin already in your body and the added activity, you might still hit lows.",
