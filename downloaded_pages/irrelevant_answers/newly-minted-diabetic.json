            "answer": "What was the test done?\u00a0\u00a0Fasting blood sugar or HA1c?The answer is yes, if you can control your blood sugar with diet and exercise you can stop taking medication.Best that you buy a blood sugar monitor and use it regularly to determine what effect the food you eat has on your blood sugar and how succesful your control is.Best Regards",

            "answer": "\"My question is when the blood sugar is going down.\"Since we have no mention of a home glucose test meter in your post my question to you is how do you know when your blood glucose is going down? And when? See this link on when to test your blood glucose before, during, and after a workout. http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/diabetes-and-exercise/DA00105As Sally mentioned, it is best to monitor your blood glucose with a home test meter.This is the only way to know, besides being tested at the doctors office, your glucose levels. You can Google \"when to test blood glucose\" for recommendations, which is different than the above link.",

I will ask my doctor about this next visit on Jan 16. My doctor just called and talked to me about diabetes diagnosis on Jan 7. He didn't even mention about blood sugar meter. However, I am going to buy one soon.Again, thanks so much for the information. I deeply appreciate it.",

There were no signs of the diabetes symptoms whatsoever. I am not overweight (187 lbs, 5'8\"). My diet was too bad either. The only possibilities that might make this happen were that my mom is diabetic and we are Asian American, I guess.",

            "answer": "One can inherit diabetes from a parent. That's an unfortunate fact as the bad gene is passed down to the child. Diabetes is a hidden disease too. Asian Americans are at 7.5% according to the ADA. At times there are symptoms and others nothing, one feels normal, but then the doctor whacks you with the shock factor of having it. It happens to a lot of us. We exercise, we eat what we think is a proper nutrition, we maintain proper weight but whack-o we end up being a diabetic, 23.7 million of us to be exact. Get a home meter and test, test, test to find out which foods cause your blood sugar to get unbalanced.",
