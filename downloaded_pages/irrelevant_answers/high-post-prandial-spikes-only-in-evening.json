A1c 's do not give false results, you really are fine! Our bodies largely self regulate, looking for and worrying about spikes when there is nothing basically wrong is stressing in itself!Chill!All the best to you.",

            "answer": "Thanks 68Survivor. Just with Type 2 in the family, I was scared it was the first signs of diabetes showing up. I also started really low carbing due to fear before my A1C. So was scared that pulled down my A1C.Diabetes86: I don't take any steroids or cortisol. I was more concerned my anxiety issues through the day naturally raised my cortisol at night. I suffer insomnia and can only sleep at night with sleep aids. I haven't done a cortisol test though. That's my next order of business I think.Anyway, I just do not like seeing spikes like that. I love that I can eat whatever I want during the day and be fine. But its troubling that I just can't seem to handle carbs at night. I am/was scared that its pre-diabetes starting to set in.",

            "answer": "OK, so I have been fasting at about 82. But I have seen a few spikes up to about 170/180 in evenings. So I had another A1C done. Came back at 4.6. WHAT THE? Hows that possible?",

    "question": "OK. Complicated one here. I'm 34. Type 2 runs in the family. I decided to start keeping an eye on it. Got a meter and strips and noticed some high PP numbers. So decided to see the Dr. Fasting was 78. A1C 5.2. Told me I was fine. Still saw some strange readings at home. Like 160's and170's. Requested a OGTT. Spiked to 127 at 1 hour. Was at I believe 115 at two hours. Again, was told that's fine. So toying around with my meter and exploring, I finally realized, I only spike in the evening. Say after 6pm or so.\u00a0\u00a0Example, I can eat a footlong sub at 1pm forlunch, with 80g carbs, and never go over 120. I can't eat the very same exact sub at say 8pm and spike to 170.\u00a0\u00a0I've also eaten jelly donuts at noon, and don't go over 115. I've eaten ice cream from the ice cream man. Again, I've not gone over 110 if he comes early. If he comes later, I've hit 160.So this is hard. The way OGTT are performed, I will always pass because my Dr office hours are during hours I don't spike.One more example. Yesterday, I had 2 burgers and fries at 4pm. I spiked at like 120 at an hour. Was at 100 at two hours. Tonight, I ate 1 burger and a few cheez it crackers, and spiked to 180. I also notice later at night, I will stay in normal range at 1 hour. Then spike higher after 2hours. Earlier in day, I always spike at 1 hour, even if I eat a lot of fat and protein with my meal.I'm normal weight, thin actually. But I do have a history of anxiety issues. Could this be a result of high cortisol in the evening?Also, I make sure my sugar is in the 80's before eating this stuff at night. And fasting is always upper 70's/Low 80's.Any advice would be most appreciated. The Dr says because I passed the fasting, A1C, and OGTT, that I am fine. And stop worrying at night. But the evening spikes worry me. I'm now planning to eat far less carbs in the evening. Just curious if anyone else has info.",
