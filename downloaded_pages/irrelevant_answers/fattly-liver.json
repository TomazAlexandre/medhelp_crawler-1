            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding alcohol and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels. Discuss these options with your consulting doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately my dr doesn't seem to have time to talk to me-i can't get a different one as I'm on medicaid and have to go where they send me. An ex.: i found out i had Lyme disease by a mssge left on my cell to go p/u my Lyme disease antibiotics at my pharmacy. All my labs are normal, no diabetes, cholesterol perfect, so the fatty liver was a surprise. With the pain I'm having that worsens after I eat a diet jumpstart will be easy. I've been eating Lean Cuisines (surprisingly tasty!) and I happily don't have much of a sweet tooth, I just enjoy eating. I need to find exercise that is comfortable for me-an afternoon of housecleaning yest. resulted in swollen hands and painful hips and knees so this will be trial and error..I'm just worried w/my tests coming back normal for my gallbladder that it's something else more ominous.",

    "question": "Am going through diags for RUQ; so far all normal (frustrating!!) and am waiting for results from my endoscopy. I was told my liver is slightly fatty and should lose weight-can do. Any other pro-active things I can do? I looked this up online and a glass of red wine was 1 tip, it also vaguely said \"don't just eat more fruits and veggies, the correct ones are important so you don't consume too much fructose\"; ok..what SHOULD\u00a0\u00a0I eat? Exercise is an obvious-got my yoga stuff back out, I've developed arthritis from Lyme disease and will just do my best. Oh-all my labs are normal and I'm not an alcoholic. I drink a few beers on \"date night\"-the article said not to drink beer, also easily remedied.",
