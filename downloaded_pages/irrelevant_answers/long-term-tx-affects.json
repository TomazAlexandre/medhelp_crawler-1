            "answer": "I was lucky that I didn't have symptoms before txing. I sure did notice the effect of the meds on my body, and I quit early and am taking my chances. So far, I think the tx sides are gone. It took about as 1/2 as long as tx to get rid of the sides. 16 weeks of tx, 8 weeks to get rid of tx sides. Sorry for the ones who tx\u00a0\u00a07 times or for 72 weeks. Even 48 would not have been doable for me.Good Luck,Bug",

            "answer": "Interesting. I wish it was as easy for me as it sounds like it has been for you, I mean in terms of controling our diabetes. You can be pretty sure there is a direct relationship between hep c and diabetes. I pretty much have cut out drinking and what I call white foods and eat a pretty healthy diet. My wieght has always been ok. I will say I went up a bit when I stopped treatment. I think the meds really slowed my metabalism down. Now with summer here and garden work to do I hope to back down to fighting weight.Anyway good luck with treatment i fyou decided to go that route.",
