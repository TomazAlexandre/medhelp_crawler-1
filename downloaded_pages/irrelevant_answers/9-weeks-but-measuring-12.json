    "question": "Has anyone measured farther along than you really were? Today, I had a midwife appointment and everything looked great. She drew blood, took blood pressure, listened to my breathing and heart. Then she said she would try for the babies heartbeat. We heard it as soon as she set the doppler on my stomach. It was loud and strong! She said that If I measure big at the next visit she would order an ultrasound. I am certain about conception day. Could something be wrong? Could it be twins?",
