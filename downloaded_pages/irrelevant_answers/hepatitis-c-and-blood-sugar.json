            "answer": "I've often suspected there's a connection between hcv and blood sugar problems. I don't know if I have blood sugar problems (I test negative for the diabetes A0 test), but I have for many years been hit with the type of fatigue you describe. HCV has definitely been linked to diabetes and obviously the liver is one of the key organs for regulating blood sugar (along with the pancreas). I've often thought about getting a blood sugar meter and start measuring sugar levels throughout the day and record the results in a diary. Write down how you feel, last meal, what was it, how long ago was it consumed, and measured blood sugar. You may very well start to identify a pattern of fatigue being associated with blood sugar, and if so, develop a plan for controlling it.",

            "answer": "I've been prediabetic for about 2 years, and got diagnosis for hcv just a few months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes does run in my family, however, so I just figured it came about for hereditary reasons.\u00a0\u00a0One thing very important though is that most docs test FASTING blood sugar to diagnose diabetes and this is absolutely insufficient.\u00a0\u00a0Most people get elevated sugars after eating for many years before their fasting levels go up.\u00a0\u00a0When my brother, who is very diabetic, went to classes for new diabetics, some of his classmates were just diagnosed yet were already suffering MAJOR side effects, including one guy who had to have a toe amputated and another whose vision was permanently affected.\u00a0\u00a0IMHO everyone who is at risk should buy a blood sugar meter and test after a good carb laden meal.\u00a0\u00a0Do it one hour after and then again two hours after.\u00a0\u00a0If your sugar at one hour is over 140 and at two hours over 120, you do have a problem that needs to be dealt with.\u00a0\u00a0Also, on the A1c test, which tells you what your average blood sugar has been for the past three months, you should not have a number higher than 6.\u00a0\u00a0The docs will tell you that up to 6.5 or so is normal; it is NOT!!\u00a0\u00a06.5 is okay for a diabetic, maybe, but not for a non-diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact, the medical establishment is doing a terrible job of diagnosising diabetes and therefore it is incumbent upon us, the patients, to do the work ourselves and then demand treatment.\u00a0\u00a0In many cases, the good old \"diet and exercise\" will suffice.\u00a0\u00a0In other cases, we need metformin or even a bit of insulin.pigeon",

I have been noticing that sometimes after I eat (especially lunch for some reason) that I seem to crash. I get real tired where I take a nap at work sometimes. I have read that hep C can cause blood sugar abnormalities. There is a history of Diabetes in my family (brother and father) and I am about 30 lbs overweight so it could be that. I am going to schedule a test with my doctor. I've had them in years past and been fine but i am wondering if it could be from the hep c. Anyone else ever experience this?",
