            "answer": "Hello Huskersfan,There have been cases of Type 2 diabetes in overweight children.\u00a0\u00a0I live near several Native American communities and these populations seem particularly vulnerable.While high blood sugars will eventually spill into our urine, it is quite common that elevated blood sugars exist even if sugar doesn't spill into urine.\u00a0\u00a0Our kidneys dump sugar above a certain level that, I think, may vary.I would recommend that you contact your doctor to do a finger-stick blood test to see if your daughter's blood sugar is within normal ranges.\u00a0\u00a0These are relatively painless but can give a good \"heads up\" if levels are high.\u00a0\u00a0There are additional tests that can be run by drawing blood in the traditional manner.I'm not a physician, but I've had diabetes for a long time and try to keep informed.\u00a0\u00a0Trust your instincts as a mom, and do follow up with your doc -- or find another doc who will help you get to the root cause of your daughter's symptoms.Hope you'll check back & let us know how things go ...",

            "answer": "Hello again, Huskersfan,I've been doing a little web research this morning and thought you might be interested in this article on Type 2 in children:http://www.cdc.gov/diabetes/projects/cda2.htmI would recommend that you keep written records for a while of your daughter's food, beverage, bathroom trips, itchiness, and any other family or individual-to-her issues.\u00a0\u00a0You might discover some patterns.Children of all ages respond in a variety of ways to emotional stresses and while it's hard to imagine she could cause her own water-weight gain, perhaps she is behaving in certain ways that might lead to it (lots of salty foods? little activity?).Currently, I'm a well-adjusted middle child, but my family still regales me with stories of things I did as a youngster -- some were obvious (to the pediatrician) responses to my younger sister's birth, the diaper-change routine for her, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I was too young to verbalize my emotions and so I regressed.The solutions, which the pediatrician explained in my presence each time was \"therapy\" ... the therapy was, in a nutshell, some 1:1 time with my parents!\u00a0\u00a0He didn't use those words (in my presence) but he prescribed such therapies as working with my parents to pick up pencils with my toes 10 times -- 3 times a day -- in response to my lost ability to \"walk\" ;-) .\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, it worked and they built on the strategy when other stuff came up.Hope this is some help to you, Huskersfan.\u00a0\u00a0Trust your parental instincts and keep working at this with your doctor -- or another doctor -- until you come to a convincing explanation and treatment.",

    "question": "My 3 (almost 4)year old daughter had recently been thirstier than normal, urinating more frequently, and had \"itchy\" genitals.I first noticed 3 weeks ago and brought her to the dr. They tested for a bladder infection and found none though they mentioned she had protein in her urine and noticed a slight redness in genitals but nothing they felt need treated.The symptoms cleared up and reappeared 2 weeks later. Unusually thirsty and peeing 6-8 times in 6 hour period. I brought her back in to Dr.They did find traces of protein again in her urine,but no sugar,and the urine was diluted.They suggested it was a behavioral problem rather than infection.She had gained 4 pounds in the 2 weeks between visits(even though I had made an effort to cut her calories, limiting juice, no sweets etc.).She is overweight for her age, although she eats the same food her other normal to underweight siblings eat.She has a different body type than them so I haven't been concerned and hoped it would even out in time.She also seems hungry all the time.Could she possibly be developing type 2 diabetes? Do the symptoms of diabetes fluctuate at the onset accounting for the on/off of her symptoms?Could water retention from the extra fluids account for the rapid weight gain?She is 52 pounds and approx. 41 inches tall,breastfed until 14 months of age.\u00a0\u00a0Is it even possible at her age to get type 2?I assumed it couldn't be type 1 because of weight gain rather than loss. Should I be concerned or just let it ride and hope it was behavioral,she is the middle child,but has never had attention getting acting before",
