            "answer": "He is a very cute little guy and I love those big ears. I hate to see that he is sick.\u00a0\u00a0 How long have you had him?\u00a0\u00a0Days, weeks, months?If I had to use my best guess here I'd say 1)Diabetes- I know he drinks constantly, does he pee constantly too?,\u00a0\u00a0These are 2 symptoms of diabetes along with Lethargy.\u00a0\u00a0Vomiting isn't included in the diabetes symptoms but the disease could be affecting your dog causing it to puke.2)Obstruction.Has he possibly eaten something that has caused an obstruction before you got him or after? or is some genetic defect causing an obstruction?\u00a0\u00a0 Has he been checked by x-ray yet for an obstruction? If not I would suggest having that done.\u00a0\u00a0 Is his tummy or neck swollen?\u00a0\u00a0Does he poop ok?\u00a0\u00a0What color is his poop?I would have the vet check for diabetes first, it is a quick less expensive test to have done then an x-ray for blockage/obstruction if no diabetes found.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted please.\u00a0\u00a0God Bless",
