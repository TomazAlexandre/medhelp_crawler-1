            "answer": "Do you masturbate a lot? You might have trained yourself to the point where you NEED physical stimulation alone and just thinking about something sexy no longer works.If this is the case take a break from jerking off for a while and even thinking of anything sexual. Hopefully your libido will get stronger, and just the thought of something sexual will be enough to arouse you. It may take some time, so be patient and try to remain strong.Keep us posted if there is any improvement. Hope this helps.",
