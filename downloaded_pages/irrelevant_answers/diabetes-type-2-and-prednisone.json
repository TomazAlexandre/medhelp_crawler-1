            "answer": "Yes. Try substituting DSMO for the prednisone. Also try tumeric powder (a small amount) in milk. As for the DSMO, it MUST be diluted, and only the medical grade used. Some people take a small amount twice a day orally well diluted. Another drug to try is MSM, which is a medicallyy approved metabolite of DSMO. Using DSMO is not approved by the medical establishment.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with type 2 in August this year - so you can see I am a complete newbie.I was terribly upset when my diagnosis was made -- because throughout my life I have always been a very prudent eater.\u00a0\u00a0I have never been more than 5lbs overweight.I have always stayed away from processed food, raw sugar, sugar-laden drinks etc.So the obvious question arises ''How did I get\u00a0\u00a0type 2 Diabetes?The short answer is \"through Prednisone--a steroid based medication with a boatload of SUGAR\"I also\u00a0\u00a0have this condition called IDIOPATHIC ANGIOEDEMA.\u00a0\u00a0I experience spontaneous swellings mostly around my face, oral cavity, tongue, and nasal tissues.This has been going on for 5 years now -- during which time I have been hospitalized 23 times.They can't find the cause - hence the term IDIOPATHIC.The only medication that seens to resolve these swellings is Prednisone -- a steroid.At the end of every swelling episode (which I treat with Prednisone) a lot\u00a0\u00a0of sugar gets dumped in my blood stream.Now I am learning how to battle diabetes, BUT I must also take the sugar-laden Prednisone when I have a swelling episode.Is anyone here in the same boat as I am?I could really use some advise.Thanks. -- Tie",
