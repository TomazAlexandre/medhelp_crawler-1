            "answer": "Without the stressors and crosses that we bear we would not have all the wonderfully understanding people that are on this forum and in our lives.\u00a0\u00a0For it is from our own stressors and those of our loved ones that we strive to learn to gain control of our lives in what manner we can to help ourselves and others.\u00a0\u00a0We learn to give to God what we must and to give to each other and ourselves what we can and should. It is in so giving that we receive.\u00a0\u00a0And so we learn how to understand and to love.\u00a0\u00a0For it is in loving that we are loved.How wonderful to be so loved!!!!What an memorably insightful moment in your life!\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for sharing this with us!!!",

    "question": "I had a call from my best friend in Newfoundland at the other side of the country last night.\u00a0\u00a0She is of a very bubbly and party type of nature and I am always saying that if she doesn't slow down soon, something is going to jump up and bite her in the backside!Well, about a year ago it did!\u00a0\u00a0She developed Diabetes but it is under control with meds and diet but she is still out there partying, just a \"little bit slower\" as she puts it.\u00a0\u00a0 She says that if she has 6 lite beer and 3 white russians instead of 12 lite beer and 6 white russians then she is slowing down!\u00a0\u00a0I don't agree but who am I to say anything!You have to understand that this is a woman who has hardly been sick a day in her life!\u00a0\u00a0She has no sympathy or time for sick people, mainly because she just doesn't understand it!\u00a0\u00a0I don't usually call her when I have bad news or am feeling down because I know she is unsympathetic BUT I still love her until the end of time and we have been friends for 25 years!So, last night she calls and wants to know what is going on with me.\u00a0\u00a0I tell her that I had my MRI etc. and then I am explaining about having this awful vertical double vision and how hard it is cause I can't drive, I can't watch TV, I can't go Christmas shopping by myself, it's so hard to ask anyone for help cause I have always been very self sufficient.When I am done with all my \"whining\" SHE SAYS...you won't believe this, I have cataracts!I almost fell off of my chair!\u00a0\u00a0I said, you are too young for cataracts!\u00a0\u00a0Ahhhh, it's the diabetes isn't it?Then she proceeded to tell me how she can't drive, can't watch TV, can't go Chrismas shopping by herself and it's so hard to ask anyone for help because she has always done things for herself....I have to tell you I was blown away!\u00a0\u00a0I think she was as well!\u00a0\u00a0She is going to have to have surgery sometime in the next 4 weeks, one eye at a time.\u00a0\u00a0She will have a period of not being able to bend down or lift anything heavy and then she will be good as new.Then she asked me if I would like to have cataracts....instead of MS...cause she said that if she could, she would TRADE with me so that I could have a life for a while instead of what I am and have been facing...we both cried together for the first time since my father died.\u00a0\u00a0My best friend offered me her life in exchange for mine...I LOVE my best friend!So, I believe that what I thought about her was wrong all along ...she WAS sympathetic but didn't know how to deal with it because she had never had to undergo anything like it.So if you have someone in your life that you feel should be a little more sympathetic to what you are dealing with, step back and take a closer look at that person and maybe, just maybe there is a reason for the way they are dealing with your illness, maybe THEY JUST DON'T KNOW HOW???",
