            "answer": "Sounds like your system could do with a boost, and these should help boost your erections, there simple and not drugs,Tribulus will help your libido, help your testosterone and boost your energy, and take around 8 weeks to get up to full power, then there is Cayenne, Garlic and Ginger, these 3 will help your blood flow down below, Cayenne I take in tomato paste with olive oil to thin it down and take 3 small spoonfuls 3 times a day, Garlic chop the cloves from a whole head and put in olive oil and take as above, but on alternate days, and Ginger I take this in black tea with lemon and honey, but you can use green tea as well, you can either use fresh Ginger or dried powder, OK first you can google all these for more info and just add for ED on the end, try to let us know how you get on.Good Luck",
