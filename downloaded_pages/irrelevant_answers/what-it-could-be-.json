            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is possible to feel tremors all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause (especially gelastic seizures as tickling the neck makes you laugh\u2014it could be other way round too). Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you doctor for your reply,Let me further elaborate that the tremors i suffer from are not shaky movements but rather it's like a cell phone vibrating .. although the intensity of these tremors are very mild and not visible to others or in the mirror .. i just sense them inside me -they are not visible thru skin layer just inside the muscles.. but i am pretty much concerned about the ticklish feeling i am suffering from .. it is driving me crazy .. i have never had a seizure before in my life.. but still could it be possible that i am epileptic all of a sudden in the middle of age 25 ?",
