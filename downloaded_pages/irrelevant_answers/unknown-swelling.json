            "answer": "Spironolactone is a potassium sparing diuretic. This means that while taking the drug excess water is excreted as urine. However, the body will retain potassium, which is often excreted in larger volumes using other types of diuretics such as Furosemide which is a loop diuretic.By not taking these meds your body is retaining excess water and gravity is allowing it to pool in the extremities of your body. Did you stop taking this drug at your discretion or was it a recommendation by your GP. It is not generally wise to stop taking at your own discretion and as the abbreviation SRS can mean any number of medical conditions I cannot comment further.However, it is worth mentioning that chronic retention of fluid can lead to a condition called compartment syndrome which is caused by the build up of pressure due to fluid. Pain is one of the first symptoms, the stiffness is probably caused due to the swelling created by the fluid and the numbness is likely from the pressure on you nerves and capillaries.I hope this helps",
