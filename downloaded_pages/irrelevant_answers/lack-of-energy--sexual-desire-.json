            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The first thing to do is get the testosterone levels checked. Some common low testosterone symptoms are decrease in sex drive, ejaculation problems, shrinking testicle, fatigue, loss of body hair, difficulty gaining or maintaining muscle, depression, and loss of strength. A combination of any of these or all of these can happen.\u00a0\u00a0With therapy there will be improvement in all these parameters with time.Other possibilities are diabetes, hypothyroidism, depression, severe anemia, stress and anxiety.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
