            "answer": "I am concerned about the seruim calcium at 9. Are you experiencing any acid reflex?\u00a0\u00a0Low calcium is cause for further testing for hyperparathroidism. This is not related to thyroid disease.Further testing for hyperparathyroidism would be Phosphorus (sp) Vit D ionized calcium - also if these tests come back abnormal - there are scans available to detect this disorder.Check out www.parathyroid.com for further information if interested.",

    "question": "I am a 47 yr. old female.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed 2 yrs. ago with hypothyroidism\\chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0Several docs ignored my test results, but now I have a good Endo.\u00a0\u00a0He also diagnosed low Vitamin D (despite eating right & being outdoors a lot).\u00a0\u00a0Since the thyroid issue came up I have developed Hypertension and - as I suspected \u2013 I have type II Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0(Which I am controlling with diet & exercise.)\u00a0\u00a0I watch my net carbs, fat, sodium, and fiber.\u00a0\u00a0I do not drink & have never smoked.\u00a0\u00a0I work out each day (walking, running, dance, weights, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0No pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0I have lots of interests & hobbies, but do not overextend myself, and keep stress to a minimum.I am currently on Levoxyl 125 mcg. (plus an additional half tablet on Sundays.)\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin D is 50,000 IU each Sunday.\u00a0\u00a0Lipitor is 20 mg. a day, and Diovan 320 mg. a day, plus aspirin therapy every other day.My cycle has been pretty regular at about 28 days.\u00a0\u00a0Over the winter I had two short & one long cycle.\u00a0\u00a0Last July, I had LSH & FSH tests done.\u00a0\u00a0The results were:\u00a0\u00a0FSH: 15.5, and LH 28.0I had these done again in Feb and the results were: FSH 10.9, and LH 58.6.\u00a0\u00a0He said that I have started menopause.My last Thyroid labs were:TSH 3:\u00a0\u00a01.313, T4, Free: 1.2\u00a0\u00a0Also, my Serum Calcium was flagged at 9.0. My Vit D in December was 25-Hydroxy 66.5\u00a0\u00a0In Oct (when I was feeling great) my results were: T4, Free: 1.05, and TSH 2.086.For the last couple of months, about a week before my cycle begins, I have had shooting pains mostly in my calves\\feet, and arms\\hands.\u00a0\u00a0The pains can also be grabbing or poking.\u00a0\u00a0(Like when you have the flu.)\u00a0\u00a0On about day five of my cycle a migraine starts up, and does not let go until about day 15.\u00a0\u00a0(Years ago when I was on the pill, I would get migraines I take Imitrex.)\u00a0\u00a0Ibuprofen does not really work (except for menstrual cramps).\u00a0\u00a0Add in hot flashes & nausea.I have days when I am foggy and\\or tired (but a rarely yawn), but there are also days when I feel like me (rare).\u00a0\u00a0I am normally an up person, but not hyper, and am able to get what I need done each day, and have energy to spare.\u00a0\u00a0Frankly, Oct was the last time I was feeling like myself.I have an appt. with my Endo this Friday where we will go over my latest bloodwork and my baseline bone scan.My question is with these symptoms, where should be headed next?\u00a0\u00a0A Rheumatologist for the pain, a Gyno for the symptoms related to my cycle, or\u2026?Even though I am 47, and have these health issues, I want to not be dragging myself though life 2\\3 of time.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes this seems like torture.Many Thanks for Your Time",
