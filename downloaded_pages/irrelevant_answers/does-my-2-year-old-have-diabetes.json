            "answer": "That is very strange indeed. She might have had those extremely high blood sugars due to an infection. I'm not sure what you mean by \"11\"\u00a0\u00a0but the other numbers are within normal range. I would definitely recommend keeping track of it closely for awhile. Those symptoms sounded very much like DKA which would not be surprising with a blood sugar of 1,000!!! If she feels like that again I would take her to the ER. Continue to monitor it for safety's sake, perhaps get a home meter. If you have any more high numbers I would take her to a pediatric endocrinologist who is more qualified to deal with it than your regular pediatrician.",

    "question": "My two year old got sick a couple of weeks ago. She was really lethargic, pale, cool and clammy. Ending up vomiting twice. Had a fruity odor and c/o pain with urination so I took her into her pediatrician. She had a temp of 100.0 in the office and they obtained a urine sample. She was acting almost normal at this point. The next morning I got a call with her lab results. Her urine had 1000 of glucose in it and 3+ ketones. I brought her in right away and her sugar was only 87. They checked her sugars a couple more times over a two week period and were 102 and 11 a few hours after eating, so not bad. Another urine sample showed trace glucose. Her HA1C in office was only 5.1, so not bad. I don't know what this all really means. If it was just a fluke that her urine sugars were so high one time or what. Anyone have any knowledge on the matter?",
