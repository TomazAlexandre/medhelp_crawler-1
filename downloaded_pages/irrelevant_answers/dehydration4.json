    "question": "OK! well I've been super sick with a really bad cold for the last like 4 or 5 days. I haven't even left my house in 4 days.... no matter what its' like I can't keep my temperature down! its constantly yo-yoing between 98.9 and 101. and I'm SO INCREDIBLY TIRED ALL THE TIME since i've been sick i can barely keep my eyes open.... so anyway today I decided \"ok, I've waited long enough, I'm going to the doctors...\" and then of course they said my blood pressure was low and my heart rate was high and that I was really dehydrated, so he told me to drink the world of stuff like gatorade, and gave me a prescription for an antibiotic which he said should help with me being so tired all the time, and then he gave me cough medicine and even an inhaler for if the cough gets really bad!But of course since they said \"dehydrated\" now I'm super panicking and I went home and cried FOREVER. Like, what if I die of dehydration?? what if I have some kind of diabetes and no one knows it?? what if I drink too much water and die from over-hydrating?? OMG OMG OMG!! And now im super tired and scared to sleep, cuz i think i've been sleeping too much, and I'm aggravating people like my sister for being so paranoid, so If someone could just give me some support and reassure me that im normal that would REALLY REALLY REALLY help.THNX.",
