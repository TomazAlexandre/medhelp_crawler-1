            "answer": "WOW, is that what it is - RAI.\u00a0\u00a0Here I though it was because I stopped smoking and finally realizing what foods really taste like - not too good. I stopped smoking just before doing RAI, so I just related it all to not smoking anymore.Taste buds have never been the same and it has been 10 yrs .\u00a0\u00a0Foods just do not taste like they use too and always leave a bad taste on my tongue.\u00a0\u00a0I guess smoking camouflaged the bad after taste. The only thing that really taste good anymore is chocolate. ;) I went through about 30 chocolate candy bars the last couple weeks - they have been on sale and I couldn't resist.And as we age don't we lose some taste buds too(?)I hope you get your taste back and soon, or you will be eating (more)chocolate.",

            "answer": "I agree with Graveslady there. I don't know if it's the RAI, the hypo hell or the meds, but my taste for food is totally different. I never liked spicy food before and now (watch out!) the spicier the better. My husband laughs all the time at me that I finally put spices in my cooking. I mean I always cooked well just not spicy and now I go through spices like crazy. It's to the point that my grandmother bought me a spice rack for Christmas, lol. I thought I was the only one, I'm so glad you guys have the same thing happening. Wow, another reason to keep posting on this board, someone will relate. ;-)",

    "question": "Just a silly little question.It's been six weeks since my RAI and things still taste very strange.\u00a0\u00a0Everything is either bland or too salty.\u00a0\u00a0Many of the foods I used to love now just taste blah.\u00a0\u00a0I know RAI can change your sense of taste but I was wondering how long it took everyone else to get back to normal with their sense of taste.(You think this would be good for the diet but bread is the only thing that tastes good which is NOT so good for a diabetic.)Happy holidays to all!",
