            "answer": "so you have symptoms of gestesinal diabetes but those are also just very typical signs of pregnancy so dont read into them too much. after i fail the one hour i started making changes to my diet although it wasn't\u00a0\u00a0bad to begin with anyway. i did get diagnosed with GD after the three hour and thankfully have been able to manage it with diet and exercise alone. doesn't mean your baby will be huge mine is weighing 6.9lbs at 36wk completely normal. i am not being induced early and if i go into labour on my own i will have a natural vaginal delivery. ever case is different but there is still a very good chance you'll have a natural delivery. baby will not be born with diabetes but you and baby do have an increase risk for type two later in life.so don't\u00a0\u00a0stress yet. wait till you have an answer but know that most of the complications from GD are minimized if managed well. :)",

            "answer": "Just try to cut off some things from your diet like you said. Juice, sugary drinks like soda or chocolate, some cereals, pancakes with syrup, donuts, pastries... I ate all these things during my first pregnancy and I was 1 point away from not passing the glucose test. I didnt realize how much sugar I was eating and on top of that I didnt exercise daily :/ I went from 106 to 175 lbs! Im trying to do better this time around.",

            "answer": "I have GD and its not bad as long as you can monitor your food in take and sugar in take. If you monitor your diet they wont put you on medicine at first its very hard to monitor it with everything your so use to eating. I cut out ALL of my soda drinking and replaced it with water. That helped a WHOLE lot. You would be surprised how much it changes. I take my sugar 4 times a day! Its aggravating but its not that bad. But because of this I am having a bigger sized baby lol but that's okay he is healthy just chunky! Good luck though!",

    "question": "I am 25wks today, thank God (:but I've noticed some issues with me & sugar. The day I took the test, I hit my head in my temple, on accident... yesterday I was seeing major spots & feeling dizzy. My doctor said to monitor it, it could be my BP. I had it checked & the spot seeing eventually went away. Not sure if it was sugar related or from my accidental head bump! I do notice I'm thirsty all the time, pee a lot, and have been exceptionally hungry. I've gained about 20 lbs & this app says that's excessive for 25 wks! :( Anyone have any insight on this? Or advice? I don't eat horribly but I'm def going to work on cutting carbs- and sugar,\u00a0\u00a0etc. I have to retake my blood test Tuesday AM & Do\u00a0\u00a0the 3hr. Really hope I don't have GD!\u00a0\u00a0Any insight would help!",
