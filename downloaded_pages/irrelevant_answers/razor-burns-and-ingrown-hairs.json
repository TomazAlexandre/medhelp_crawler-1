            "answer": "Hi,As you have noticed this post shaving , chances are that this could be folliculitis.This could be folliculitis, dermatitis, or allergic reaction. In most individuals there are outbreaks of folliculitis from time to time.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months. After the lesions have healed you could try waxing.Let us know if you need any other information and consult a skin specialist if the lesion is persistent.Regards.",

            "answer": "Hi! BhumikaMD recommended to try Mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae).Will this ointment get rid of the apparent inflammation of the pores in my legs? If this is an antibiotic lotion, or cream, can I use it indefinitely? I have had follicullitis for years, for what I seem to find out...and I keep a very good hygiene. Will it help with the scarring on my legs?Thank you!",

    "question": "Hi! For many, many years I have been dealing with the coarse hair on my legs...I am a brunette and my skin is quite pale. I have tried it all: razors, electric little machines, waxes, lotions,...you name it.I cannot afford laser removal, so I am still dealing with the hair. If I shave, it grows back on the same day!If I remove it with the electric machine or wax...it doesn't last more than 2 or 3 days, and I get ingrown hairs...really deep inside the skin.I have ugly, horrible scars in my legs from trying to pull ingrown hairs out. I am desperate. I wear long pants even in summer, on the hottest days, because I am terribly ashamed of my hairy legs...full of scars.I wish I could wear a miniskirt, or shorts, or a cute little summer dress...Help!",
