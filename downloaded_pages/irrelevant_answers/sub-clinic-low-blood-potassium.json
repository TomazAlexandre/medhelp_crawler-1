            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You will need to get kidney function, liver function, thyroid function and diabetes assessed. If this is already done then you have essential hypertension. If you are taking any drugs for high blood pressure, then this too can cause a slightly low potassium. If all tests are normal, then you can take citrus fruits, banana and green leafy vegetables to supplement potassium. It is important to bring your blood pressure under control. First aim at that. In all probability the potassium level will settle down.Hope this helps. Take care!",
