            "answer": "Just got the results....\u00a0\u00a0Findings: There is slight asymmetry of the optic nerve sheath structures.\u00a0\u00a0This is probably related to sight obliquity of the coronal images.The ventricular and cisternal spaces are within normal limits for age.\u00a0\u00a0No interracial mass or extra-axial fluid collection is seen.\u00a0\u00a0The signal properties of the grey and white matter structures are normal.\u00a0\u00a0No abnormal enhancement is seen.Impression:\u00a0\u00a0Essentially normal MRI of the brain and orbits.\u00a0\u00a0Slight asymmetry of the optic nerve sheath structures is attributed to the slight obliquity of the coronal plane.",
