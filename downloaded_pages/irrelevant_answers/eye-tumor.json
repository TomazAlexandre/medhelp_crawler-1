    "question": "I've never had an eye exam done before until I noticed my vision was starting to get blurred.\u00a0\u00a0I realized it was just my right eye and not both eyes.\u00a0\u00a0After going to the eye doctor and then being sent to a retinologists right away, I found out I had a tumor in my eye.\u00a0\u00a0The retinologists says it was probably congenital and very rare.\u00a0\u00a0He thinks it's just a benign tumor.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me an injection to prevent further vision loss.\u00a0\u00a0But this injection has been studied in patients who had problems due to macular degeneration and not eye tumor.\u00a0\u00a0It's only been a week.\u00a0\u00a0He's just going to monitor and check my eye every 2-3 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any advice or suggestions for me?",
