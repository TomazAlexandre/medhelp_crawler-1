            "answer": "Thank you for visiting the family practice forum.It sounds like you need to see a primary care physician such as an \"Internist\" or a Family Doctor to have some initial tests.The shortness of breath and fatigue are symptoms that could indicate asthma. The fatigue could also indicate an underlying thyroid problem such as hypothyroidism.Your other symptoms seem to have an \"inflammatory\" basis. (Muscle pain, back pain, pain in the joints of your fingers). You are also having some type of recurrent urethra inflammation and when I hear about recurrent inflammation and/or infection I always think we need to rule out diabetes.Here is the plan of action you need to follow.1. Go to the doctor (start with a Family Doctor or Internist).2. Have a blood pressure check, and blood tests to check fora. Thyroid functionb. Blood sugarc. \"Arthritis panel\"3. You may need to have your doctor refer you for \"pulmonary function testing\". This will help determine if there is any asthma present4. The doctor may also consider ordering an EKG and Chest Xray.If you dont get answers here, I guess the \"specialist\" I would consider seeing would be a Rheumatologist (to further evaluate the symptoms you have in your muscles/joints) OR a Pulmonologist (if the pulmonary function tests show any abnormality).I hope this helps!Dean M. Tomasello, M.D.",

            "answer": "I have been having very bad abdominal pain for about 9 months now. I have been to doctors many of times they do a sonagram on me and find nothing. I had 2 miscarriages in a 5 month period. I have had this proablem before but it\u00a0\u00a0like disappeard for about a year but now it is back and no one seems to know what it is. It sometimess hurts when I have sex, you press on my butt like hit or smack(ya know just playing around) and\u00a0\u00a0when you just press on it near the bottom. I can't run or do anything that involves alot of movement. I have regular bowel movements but and the pain sometimes last for days at a time theen goes away and sometimes it just for a couple hours and sometimes it's just for that moment it's a very sharp pain right in the middle of my lower stomach like around my ovaries. I've been told that it was stres and numerous of things but it doesn't make it better. I finally found a doctor that suggested that he do LAPAROSCOPY surgery on me and that is scheduled for 5/29/02. So maybe he'll see the proablem but I was just wandering if you had any answers. Thank-you verey much.",

The pain in my shoulders only comes about when i lift my shoulder for a short period of time and then they feel like lead and then my shoulders burn.\u00a0\u00a0What could all of this possibly mean, and what type of doctor should i consult about all of this?",
