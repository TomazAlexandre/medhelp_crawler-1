            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Actually all values including AST can be considered normal. ALT is at a higher end. Causes of liver transaminase (AST and ALT) elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. Steatosis and cirrhosis are ruled out by the ultrasound. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia and thyroid disease, can also cause liver transaminase elevations. Most liver diseases are characterized by greater ALT elevations than AST elevations except cirrohsis and alcohol abuse. ALT also rises in bile duct obstruction due to stone. Since spleen is mildly enlarged please follow up with a hematologist to rule out hemolytic anemia.Hope this helps. Take care!",
