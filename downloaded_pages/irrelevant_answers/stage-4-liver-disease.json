            "answer": "Welcome to the forum. There will be many replies throughout the day by ppl more informed about triple tx than I but in the meantime I will give you my 2 cents.Normally if a person is cirrhotic the idea is to treat right away. However if your Dr. feels like you are close to decompensating (End stage liver disease) s/he may want to play it safe and wait.The important thing is that you have a Hepatologist who is monitoring your condition.You might ask for a second opinion if you really believe you can handle it but I tend to trust the Hepa on this and I am not one who trusts Drs., in general.Good luck to you and stay tuned for more in depth replies.",

            "answer": "Cirrhosis IS the last stage. Your liver is dead. You can maintain through diet and medication, but like me your doc is waiting for something that won't outright kill you before you get a transplant. The current treatment right now is deemed too dangerous, will drive you downhill quickly so be patient. I'm hoping for a liver then treatment, or if medications are approved that won't make me worse quickly then my doc will recommend treatment. I watch my diet, don't feel like eating so no big deal. It's better if you get the weight off though. Diabetes is just another horrible complications to monitor.",

            "answer": "\"I have cirrhosis, but not sure what level the cirrhosis is. I guess my liver is cirrhotic enough that I have esophageal varices and hemorrhoids, meaning that venous flow through the liver has been diverted by the scar tissue.\"This means you have complete cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Often called compensated cirrhosis with portal hypertension. Your cirrhosis has advanced past the early stage of cirrhosis when there is none to little portal hypertension. It appears you understand that portal hypertension happens when the liver becomes so scared the blood flow through the liver is obstructed and blood flows through collateral veins (varices). This condition also causes an enlarged spleen and lower platelet count as well as a nodular liver that can be seen on any imaging scan.\"I went to a prominent hospital to begin treatment only to find out that they are delaying any treatment until the new protease inhibitors come out.\"I hope this hospital has a liver transplant center there and you are being treated by a hepatologist (liver specialist) in the transplant department? If not you need to get care at a hospital that has a liver transplant center. Your cirrhosis is advanced and you have diabetes which makes managing your health complex. Only a transplant center has the doctors and resources to help someone like you manage their cirrhosis and possibly treat your hepatitis C. I can\u2019t over emphasize enough how important it is to be under the care of a transplant clinic ASAP. You liver disease is serious and could be life threatening if not managed properly.\"So... I told them I didn't want to wait, I wanted to start something now.\u00a0\u00a0(I don't want the cirrhosis to get any worse!!)\u00a0\u00a0They told me that only the doctor could make the decision if I would be \"allowed\" to use the traditional tri-level therapy or if I could even have treatment at all.\"Yes, only a hepatologist who understands your full health picture can know if the benefit is greater than the risk of treatment. In compensated patients with portal hypertension triple therapy, which has been available for over two years now and is nothing new, can cause decompensation or death in a small number of cirrhotic patients.Contrary to what you have been told... triple therapy, while more effective at curing hep C has far more complications and adverse events then the old dual therapy in patients with cirrhosis. While it would be ideal if you could cure your hepatitis C, you don\u2019t want to make your liver disease irreversible and risk death to treat it either.\"Dr. who said there was no hurry for treatment, just get it in next 1-2 years.\"This doctor is at best ill informed about liver disease and has told you something contrary to what experts in the field will tell you is the reality of the situation. That simple fact is time is not on your side. Having cirrhosis and portal hypertension and diabetes makes your odds of hep C cure greatly reduced although not impossible. Get help at a liver transplant center now. By doing that you will give yourself the best chance of a good outcome.Are you having twice yearly surveillance for HCC (liver cancer)? Ultrasound and AFP level? You need to, as patients with cirrhosis and diabetes have an much increased risk of liver cancer. HCC if not caught early is usually fatal. A transplant center will make sure you are screened as long as you have cirrhosis.Good luck to you!Hector",

            "answer": "Hi Shesam, you've got a tough diagnosis on your hands. I've been there, but was able to treat through a transplant hospital. Like you, I was scared. The protease inhibitors were fresh on the market and they gave me a shot at them.The clearance rates for cirrhotic patients are actually pretty high. I didn't have diabetes, and that can be the complication that they are concerned about. Like the others, trusting your hepa doc and getting to a transplant center is a good bet for good monitoring.All my best to you,Karen:)",

            "answer": "As others above have said, you need to be seen by a transplant hepatologist, in a transplant center.\u00a0\u00a0You will usually find these in a large university medical center.\u00a0\u00a0Right now you have a middle stage of Cirrhosis, meaning the damage to your liver is irreversible, and you are having serious symptoms of Cirrhosis, which could become life threatening at some point in the future (near or far).\u00a0\u00a0Varices can bleed out, and people can die. Some of the other symptoms that may begin to occur at some point in the future (near or far) are ascites (fluid build up) and/or hepatic encephalopathy (a build up of ammonia due to the liver not functioning properly and causing some brain/cognitive symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0You are somewhere in the middle.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, your liver may be compensated, but it could begin to decompensate (not function properly) at any time.\u00a0\u00a0It is very important to be seen regularly by a hepatologist in a transplant center who can properly evaluate your health, decide whether or not it is safe to treat your Hep C with the currently available treatments, and to give you medications and other treatment plan information to manage your symptoms of Cirrhosis, which could become life threatening at some time.\u00a0\u00a0No one knows when, but careful monitoring by a hepatologist will help to prevent that.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, make your appointment with a hepatologist at the nearest transplant center to you, try to reduce your sodium intake, avoid red meat and other iron rich foods, if you take vitamins do not take vitamins with iron, and try to increase the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables that you are eating.\u00a0\u00a0Drink water.\u00a0\u00a0No alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0No ibuprofen or other NSAIDS.\u00a0\u00a0No supplements unless OK'd by a hepatologist.Advocate1955",
