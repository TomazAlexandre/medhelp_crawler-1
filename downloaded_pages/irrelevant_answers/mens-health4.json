            "answer": "Like Life360 mentions your prostate may be causing the problem.Make an appointment to see your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor can examine you and will know if your prostate is enlarged which would cause you not to empty your bladder properly.\u00a0\u00a0The next step then would be to take a blood sample to be tested for PSA levels.\u00a0\u00a0As you are also having a \"leakage\" problem, your doctor is likely to refer you to a urologist.Another reason for getting up a few times to empty the bladder due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A blood HbA1C blood test would confirm whether you have diabetes.",
