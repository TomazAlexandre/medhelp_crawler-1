            "answer": "hi my brother has a history of long term alcoholism and recently had an acute attack of pancreatits he was in hospital for 5 days had cat scan, ultrasound and mri scan.\u00a0\u00a0His MRI scan confirmed that he has a 4 cm lesion in the 6th segment of his liver and other smaller lesions.\u00a0\u00a0He is awaiting to have a liver biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0He also has developed diabetes type 2 and has haemocromatosis.\u00a0\u00a0His ALT was 176 and his bilirubin 5.7.\u00a0\u00a0I would have to say in answer as to what causes lesions, it could be any number of different reasons but definitely hepatocellar damage of some degree would indicate lesions be they benign or malignant.\u00a0\u00a0It is very frustrating if you cannot find any information, but you should be able to get a clearer picture from your physician.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment options for lesions on the liver would really depend upon the nature of the lesions and any other health complications.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this is a little helpful.",

            "answer": "I just found your post and I am hoping by now a biopsy has been performed and you have gotten some answers. I don't know what causes lesions but most times liver lseions are benign...for non alcoholics or drug users. I am assuming from your post that you have never been diagnosed with any type of cancer. good luck. julie",
