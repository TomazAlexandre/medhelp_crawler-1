            "answer": "An a1c of 5.8 gives you an average blood sugar of about 120.\u00a0\u00a0Research has shown that for people who have a1c above 5, it will usually progress / get worse over time, unless they take action to address weight, diet, and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0If you cannot get your a1c down with lifestyle measures, then medications become appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0Consider that a completely normal, non-diabetic a1c if < 5.0.Cut out all refined sugars, this will include limiting fruit, grains.Look into adopting a paleo style diet.\u00a0\u00a0The diet should be low carb, moderate protein, high healthy fats.\u00a0\u00a0try to exercise at least 30 - 60 minutes a day, ideally after eating (exercise helps reduce blood sugars).Would also recommend you get a home blood sugar meter and start testing blood sugars 1 1/2 - 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0This will let you see which foods are ok and don't affect your blood sugar and which foods make your blood sugars rise too high.\u00a0\u00a0This will also tell you how many carbs you can eat.\u00a0\u00a0Some people can control blood sugar with moderate carb diet (100- 200 g/day), but others need to be more strict (< 100, or even < 50 g/day).\u00a0\u00a0Target is to keep peak blood sugar < 120 (ideally < 100).Hope this helps.",
