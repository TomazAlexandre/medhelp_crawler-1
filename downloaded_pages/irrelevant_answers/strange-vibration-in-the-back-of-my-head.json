            "answer": "Hi katie,If you are feeling vibrations in the back of your head, it can be due to some peripheral nerve pathology.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.I think you need to consult your PCP, test for your sugar status and simultaneously you can start OTC multi-vitamin supplements, following which you can see for disappearance of symptoms.If your symptoms do not improved, then you can consult a neurologist and decide regarding further course of action.Hope this helps.Bye.",
