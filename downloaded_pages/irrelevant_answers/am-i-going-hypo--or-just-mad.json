            "answer": "First thing is that TSH is a pituitary hormone that supposedly reflects accurately levels of the actual thyroid hormones.\u00a0\u00a0In reality, it cannot be shown to correlate well with either Free T4 or Free T3, much less with symptoms, which are the most important consideration.\u00a0\u00a0Scientific studies have shown that Free T3 correlated best with hypo symptoms, while Free T4 and TSH did not correlate at all.A good thyroid doctor will treat a hypo patient clinically by testing and adjusting Free T3 and Free T4 as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0You can get some good insight into clinical treatment from this letter written by a good thyroid doctor for patients that he sometimes consults with after initial tests and evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0The letter is then sent to the participating doctor of the patient to help guide treatment.\u00a0\u00a0In the letter, please note the statement, \"the ultimatecriterion for dose adjustment must always be the clinical response of the patient.\"http://hormonerestoration.com/files/ThyroidPMD.pdfSo you should insist on being tested for Free T3 and Free T4 (not the same as Total T3 and T4), each time you go in for tests.\u00a0\u00a0Since hypo patients are also frequently too low in the range for Vitamin D, B12 and ferritin, you should request those as well.From your mention of \"bloods\", I wondered if you are located in the UK?",

            "answer": "I am a bit puzzled.\u00a0\u00a0You have been taking carbimazole, which usually is done in conjunction with being hyperthyroid from Graves's Disease, and after a thyroidectomy, and/or RAI.\u00a0\u00a0Were you previously diagnosed for Graves's?\u00a0\u00a0 What symptoms are you having now?When did you stop the carbimazole?\u00a0\u00a0 Are you being medicated based on TSH levels?\u00a0\u00a0If so, that just will not work because TSH is affected by so many different things it is unreliable as the sole diagnostic by which to medicate a thyroid patient.\u00a0\u00a0You are going to need to insist on being tested for Free T3 and free t4 each time you go in for testing.\u00a0\u00a0I say that because Free T3 largely regulates metabolism and many other body functions.\u00a0\u00a0Scientific studies have shown that Free T3 correlated best with hypo symptoms, while Free T4 and TSH did not correlate at all.I know very well how difficult it is in the UK to get the testing and treatment needed for thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0You might keep in mind this advice from a fellow UK member who was finally successful in getting what she needed.\"What I have learned from my experience is that you have to go to the Dr's office and TELL THEM WHAT YOU WANT and to go backed up with knowledge.\u00a0\u00a0You have to tell them that you have done your reading and looked into your condition and care about the long-term treatment of your health and thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0If you fight for what you want, you will eventually find someone that is happy to go along with your wishes.\u00a0\u00a0But we all have to take charge of our own health, right?\"",

            "answer": "I agree that you need to get both FT3 and FT4 tested every time you have blood work done.\u00a0\u00a0I, also, understand how hard that is to get done in U.K. We've had some members who have been able to talk their doctors into it, anyway.\u00a0\u00a0We've also had some that have had to go private in order to get the testing/treatment they need.Unfortunately, thyroid hormone levels can still be off, even with a so called \"normal\" TSH.With\u00a0\u00a0your peroxidase (I assume that's Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies?) at > 600, it appears that you do have Hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0Is that the only antibody you were tested for?\u00a0\u00a0While Hashimoto's is most often associated with hypothyroidism, it is, sometimes characterized by periods of hyper, alternating with periods of hypo.\u00a0\u00a0You could also have Graves Disease, which is associated only with hyper.\u00a0\u00a0You really should try to get some more antibody testing.\u00a0\u00a0There's another test for Hashimoto's called Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TGab) that should be done.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid Stimulating Immunoglobulin (TSI) is the definitive test for Graves. It's rare, but there people with both.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had a thyroid ultra sound to determine whether or not you have nodules and/or a swollen/inflamed thyroid? Sometimes, nodules produce hormone independently of the thyroid.I also agree with Sally, that you need to get tested for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Along with thirst and fatigue, the quick temper, and weight loss can also be symptoms of diabetes.",

    "question": "Hi Folks,Quick question...I attended with my GP at start of week as I feel (and my husband has noticed changes) that i may be starting to go Hypo...tired, couldnt care less attitude, achy etc.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed as having Hashis last year, but have not been on any medication since the end of last year due to my TSH levels being 'normal' ranges.I had my bloods tested and my TSH is 1.2 (range is 027-4.2).\u00a0\u00a0My blood was last tested in March and TSH was 0.91. Not a big jump a know, but as no other tests were carried out (even though my GP said he would ask for T4 to be ran and that T3 is only tested if there is a TSH abnormality) then I dont know where this leaves me.Any suggestions?Thank you,Tracey",
