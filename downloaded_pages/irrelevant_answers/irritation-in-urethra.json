    "question": "I've had this problem for going on 4 months now and it's starting to make me extremely depressed.About 4 and half months ago I had unprotected sex, about 2 weeks later I started getting an itching in the tube that goes through your penis it feels like it's just below the head of the penis. the itching irritation is CONSTANT there is no relief what so ever it is always there and nothing seems to calm it at all. There is also no other symptoms apart from this.I thought this was probably an STI so I went to the clinic and got tested this returned with negative results so I thought it must of just been a coincidence I got this problem at the same time however I went to the doctor and told him the problem and he suggested that I got tested again, I got tested again and this resulted with negatives again.he then sent me to a urologist who gave me some antibiotics for a UTI these did not work, then I got some for urethrtitis this did also not work. After this they sent me to a doctor so he could look in my urethra with a camera, the doctor found nothing abnormal and I was discharged.Anyone have any ideas as to what this could be?",
