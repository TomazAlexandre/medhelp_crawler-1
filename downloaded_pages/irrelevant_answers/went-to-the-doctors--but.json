            "answer": "That is good that your arm is getting better.Glad that you did manage to get to see the doctor and I agree with you that he should have listened to your heart and lungs.If you do not know what the blood tests are for, you can always ring the surgery and ask them what you are being tested for.\u00a0\u00a0I should imagine one of the blood tests will be for iron deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Iron deficiency does cause for you to feel tired and hungry for oxygen.Did the doctor say when you will get\u00a0\u00a0your results and told you to make a follow-up appointment to discuss the blood results?Feeling anxious and stressed to go and see the doctor can cause you to feel more unwell.\u00a0\u00a0Take things easy.Regardless whether you feel hungry or not, try and have something healthy to eat.\u00a0\u00a0A boiled or scrambled egg (or how you like it), some yogurt.\u00a0\u00a0Brown toast with peanut butter, or whatever you like on it; any piece of fruit, some nuts like almonds or Brazil.\u00a0\u00a0 Keep off biscuits, cakes, sugary foods, processed foods and fizzy pops and alcohol.Have something healthy to eat every 2 or 3 hours.Make sure that you have your fluid intake.\u00a0\u00a0Water is best, diluted juices, soups.",

            "answer": "Hi, I hope you are doing relatively okay. I was just up searching because I've been having trouble breathing. Anyway, I just wanted to pass along some information. Hopefully, you do not have Lyme Disease. That being said, you should know that 9 out of ten tests come back negative even in people who have this disease. And yes, often there is a red rash after a tick bite, but in some cases it is either hidden, or symptoms do not present themselves until long after the initial bite. It can be months, or in some cases longer. In my case I was diagnosed at eighteen a few months after I had a rash and treated. However, years later I began having many symptoms that were generalized and none of the doctors had answers. Eventually I came to realize most were Lyme Symptoms, so I asked to be tested. Two different tests came back negative. Anyhow, not the point. You likely don't necessarily have it; with only a few symptoms. However, if your doctor does not find an answer for your ailments, keep Lyme in the back of your head and know that it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to get an accurate test, no matter what your MD tells you. Prayerfully it is not, because if left undiagnosed and untreated, the symptoms will almost undoubtedly expand into even more issues. Good Luck. Oh and just make sure to be very pro active and assertive with your health care providers. I failed to do so (not that it would have maybe made a difference), and just wound up sicker and taking a lot of medications to mask the symptoms-not get to the root of the problem.",
