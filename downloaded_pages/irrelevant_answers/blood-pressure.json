            "answer": "140/90 upwards is considered high. Above 120/80 is considered pre-hypertension but is normally seen as acceptable until it gets to 140/90. Ideal is 90-120/60-80. Optimal pressure is usually considered as 120/80. The top number is the pressure at the peak of the heart pushing out blood. The bottom number is when everything is at the peak of relaxation. So if you subtract one from the other you get the pulse pressure. This says how much pressure the heart is exerting on the arteries. A pulse pressure of 40 is seen as normal. Your PP is 53 which is a little higher than normal. You can get this under control with medication but it is important to establish the cause, if there is one. Some people have no apparent reason for high pressure. For example, I take high dosages of blood pressure meds, but my pressure is average 146/103. My diastolic of 103 is stage 2 and they can't get it down. The more meds I am given it seems the higher the pressure gets, as if my body is fighting against them. I think I'm just abnormal lol.",
