            "answer": "I have also suffered with gastroparesis for over 6 years now.. That's when I began making trips to our local hosptal's emergency room.. The nausea is dibilating to say the least.. The E.R. physicians could do nothing but put me to sleep using 2 forms of medication.. I was always admitted and usually slept until the next day.. I would go home after 3 or 4 days but would end up on their doorstep no later than 4 to 6 weeks later..My gastroenterologist informed me of a new procedure being tried with great results where he would go into my stomach with a scope and inject botox into the pyloric sphincter ( the muscle which allows food to enter into the intestines ).. I really didn't think it would work because it sounded to much like a miracle at such an easy price to me ( not money price ) ..I was given the botox injection just after I went to sleep from the relaxing medication and woke up not long afterward.. The proceure does not take long at all. The relief from the nausea was almost immediate and I couldn't believe it.. My botox injections usually last me for 12 to 14 months.. I have had 2 injections thus far and am scheduled for another on November 1 st, 2010..If you or anyone you know suffers this awful disease and has these symptoms, you should consult your physician and see if this treatment is right for you..",

            "answer": "Dear suesan and anyone suffering from Gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Here is my story.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter \"had\" suffered from nausea, vomiting, and extreme pain just below her left ribcage for the past 5 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0We had been to 3 gastroenterologists and numerous E.R. visits (15 per month) in which all her labs, xrays, ultra sounds, CT, endoscopes were always normal, so doctors began to look at her as a drug seeker, which was certainly disheartening.\u00a0\u00a0She does not have Diabetes so noone ever thought about Gastroparesis...the thing is \"you don't have to be Diabetic to have it!\u00a0\u00a0We eventually went to California Pacific Medical Center in SanFrancisco.\u00a0\u00a0There they did a \"Gastric Emptying test (not painful).\u00a0\u00a0 The next day she went for another endoscope....but this time they checked the pyloric sphicter muscle contractions...which in her case completely closed up!\u00a0\u00a0Her diagnosis was then Severe Idiopathic Gastroparesis. At that time they injected Botox into the pyloric sphincter which instantly relaxed the muscle.\u00a0\u00a0Now, so far it's only been a week as I write this, but she has had no symptoms of nausea, vomiting, or pain! She must take daily medications, such as erythromycin, reglan, acid reducer, and norco for any pain, and must follow a strict diet; such as, NO raw vegetables or fruit (fruit cups and applesauce are fine).\u00a0\u00a0She can eat lean meats, low fat, low fiber (fiber is hard to digest).\u00a0\u00a0For the most part...I have my daughter back and I couldn't be happier.\u00a0\u00a0Prayer and lots of research work wonders:)\u00a0\u00a0God be with you and I pray your situation has as wonderful of an outcome.

            "answer": "I'm Sabrina who after having my gal bladder removed about 3 months ago experienced a paralyzed stomach.\u00a0\u00a0I was hospitalized for about 8 days before I could hold food or fluids down.\u00a0\u00a0After being released I was finally able to hold food and fluids down when I ate large portions. I believe after eating, although I would have immediate trips to bathroom wih nasuea half of the food would remain in my stomach is how I maintained my weight.\u00a0\u00a0however, a couple of months after coming home\u00a0\u00a0I became extremely constpated, unpredictable bowel movements and continuous nausea,\u00a0\u00a0I was frustrated and called my doctor who scheduled an endoscope. Obviously a decision was made prior to my visit to treat me with Botox to help me have a more comfortable lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0It has been 6 days, I haven't had but a few pebbles of stool and only one vomitting episode last night after eating a plate of crab legs from a las vegas buffet I assume weight loss is a possibility with Botox if you follow the eating restrictions and because you can't hold as much food down. I also watched a video from the Doctor's\u00a0\u00a0online were the actual doctor had the injection done personally to demonstrate her confidence in the treatment. She was not trying to loose weight, but lost 7lbs in two months without any effort.\u00a0\u00a0My curiosity is does anyone really have sooner bowel movements than prior to the surgery? I've been reding other comments from a few who asked the question, \"has anyone lost weight\"?\u00a0\u00a0Are we not answering because we're not focused on the weight loss issue?\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss could be a positive or negative effect depending indivudal circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0I too am curious and would also like to hear from those who personally had the procedure done.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wanting feedback on bowel regularity and the weight loss?\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes to us all with gastro paresis !",
