            "answer": "Read your early Apr posts on the Gastro forum. Unexpected/sudden and unplanned weight loss should be a major concern too. Diabetes is one of many causes for this. If \"just had another test done yesterday\" included testing your glucose levels the results may be off. Internal infections will skewer glucose testing. Since you mentioned being hypoglycemic at age 22 where you classified as type 1 or type 2 diabetic? Have you been on insulin for the past 11 years or ever been? In your case, it would help to know if you have had the following tests:For type 1 diabetes:\u25cf Pancreas insulin test\u25cf C-peptide [tests cells which produce insulin]For type 2 diabetes:\u25cf A1c testKnowing your diabetes test results, your body weight, if you have a nutrition [diet] plan, and whether exercise is part of your daily regimen gives us a broader insight.Not sure I helped much with your problem, but that\u2019s all I\u2019ve got. Maybe some forum commenter's have other ideas? Good luck",

            "answer": "My doc just took some blood and said she will call me with the results.\u00a0\u00a0When I had the test 11 years ago, it was a big production.\u00a0\u00a0I had to drink some \"syrupy liquid\" then a nurse came and drew some blood evry so often over the course of a few hours.\u00a0\u00a0But then the doc said I was hypglycemic and told me about eating six small meals a day and that was pretty much it.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing about Diab. 1 or 2..... I am seeing a rheumatologist for some other problems and she was concerned about my weight loss too.\u00a0\u00a0But my GP is referring me to a gastro doc to see if I have a problem with my stomach and/or digestive tract.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have to go see my GYN because I haven't had my menstruation in 2 months, which is very unusual for me (AND No, I'm NOT pregnant..... I've been tested three times).... So, I don't know if this is all related or just coincidences.I currently weigh 161.\u00a0\u00a0I eat pretty well.\u00a0\u00a0No caffeine, no fast food, unless you count pizza.\u00a0\u00a0I eat oatmeal, yougurt bagels for breakfast, usually a light lunch or leftovers from dinner, and a good dinner.\u00a0\u00a0No fried foods, except maybe once a month.\u00a0\u00a0I try not to eat after 8:00, and that's about it.\u00a0\u00a0I don't exercise regularly,\u00a0\u00a0But, I am very active as I have a 4 & 5 yr old and stay at home with them, so we are constantly out and about running errands, playing, etc.\u00a0\u00a0So, that's about it........ So, I guess we shall see hwat it is as time goes by......",

            "answer": "Your diet plan is close but could use some fine tuning. Try restricting carb intake [yogurt bagels] as carbs raise glucose [blood sugar] levels. On packaged and canned food read all nutrition labels carefully. Watch for hidden sugars. For example, under Carbohydrate sugars are listed in grams. One would think 7 grams isn't much, right? Well, every 7 grams equals one heaping tablespoon of refined sugar.Also avoid foods made with white flour - breads, pasta, tortillas, etc - potatoes, and white rice as these are quickly digest and turn into sugar. Milk contains an average 8 grams of sugar per glass. Focus instead on eating whole grains, vegies, fish, poultry and lean meats.Test your blood sugar 2-3 hours after eating [postprandial]. Diabetic target range is <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dl, perfect is normal levels of 70-99 mg/dl. Postprandial testing provides an insight on how the foods you just ate affect your glucose levels. Avoid those that elevate your levels. Good luck with the Rheumatologist and Gastroenterologist.",

I don't drink milk (haven't since I was 8...long story, so that's not an issue)..... I WILL take this quite serious should the doctor tell me I am diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I know the problems with diabetes and have seen them with my father first hand.\u00a0\u00a0He's not overweight at all, in fact, he could gain some weight, but he has had some issues being hardheaded with dieting in the past, but he is on top of the game, now.\u00a0\u00a0My sister who was recently diagnosed IS NOT eating right and she is overweight, so\u00a0\u00a0I constantly give her the \"talk\" about \"what daddy used to go through\", so I will be a good patient IF I have it.\u00a0\u00a0Until then, I'm eating yogurt, because it helps with my stomach problems (Activia).\u00a0\u00a0I'm drinking OJ (though it complicates my stomach problems with\u00a0\u00a0the acid).\u00a0\u00a0I'm eating Italian food, because I am obsessed, and I eat in moderation anyway.\u00a0\u00a0My stomach can barely keep any food in it to begin with, so I don't eat a lot......
