            "answer": "Many times when a person is first diagnosed, the problem is new enough that the pancreas is still under attack and is producing some insulin at times. This is called the honeymoon phase. There is no way to know how long this period will last, and testing his glucose levels often is the only way to know if his glucose levels will stay normal or will go back up to diabetic levels or maybe bounce back and forth between the two while his damaged pancreas is trying to work.The best way to find out if a person is a true 'autoimmune diabetic' whose immune system has destroyed or is in the process of destroying the pancreas is by asking his doctor to run tests to find out:1) if he carries the damaged genes that it is thought all type 1 diabetics carry that make us likely to become diabetic, and2) if antibodies are present that show that his immune system is attacking his pancreas (also for antibodies showing an attack on his thyroid).Those tests can\u00a0\u00a0show what is happening and can help prove a diagnosis.",

            "answer": "Everything is possible !!!!\u00a0\u00a0But I would suggest that misdiagnosis would be unlikely.What is more possible is that he is what they call honeymooning.\u00a0\u00a0This happens shortly after you have been diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0You have been taking enough insulin for your body to recover physically from the initial shock and then your panceas begins to function normally again for a short time while it gets out the last remains of insulin that your body could make.\u00a0\u00a0Usually after this is used up you will go back to regular doses.When I honeymooned I went without any insulin for quite some time.\u00a0\u00a0This may be extended for him as well as he seems to be very athletic from what you said.\u00a0\u00a0The more exercise you get the less insulin you need therefore he will use what he has in his body longer - because he is using less of it.The Dr. will be a great help during honeymooning.",

    "question": "My son was diagnosed with T-1 diabetes in October '07.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0He is a professional athlete and had taken a creatine supplement with an insulin booster.\u00a0\u00a0After 2 weeks of taking it, he got very sick, all the classic symptoms of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 Blood tests revealed that he had T-1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0After 3 months of strict diet and exercise and 10-15 units of Levimir daily, he has been able to go 10 days\u00a0\u00a0now without insulin while averaging 93 BSL. While taking insulin, his BSL would drop into the 50's and 60's.\u00a0\u00a0 Also at the time of diagnosis the blood test revealed hypothyroidism and he has been taking a generic version of Synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0 Is it possible that the creatine and thyroid may have caused a misdiagnosis?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Could a true T-1 diabetic go without insulin for 10 days?",
