    "question": "Hi,My now 5 year old (wonderful) border collie has been having on and off UTI/kidney infections. We have zero clue where shes' getting these from. About a year ago she was really sick where her specific gravity was way off, very strong bacteria (don't rememember what type) was present where the doc said \"this is odd for them to get this\". It got to her kidneys. I don't remember the meds but it took a long time to get back to normal.Well now again she has a UTI where she's peeing in the house, drinking water like crazy, and the doc put her on meds for diluted urine (don't rememember what type but like a Cipro type for humans). Well she peed again and is drinking more water than before. I took a sample and just looking at it it was very, very light yellow. We're waiting for results.How/why is she getting these? We originally thought\u00a0\u00a0the first time maybe it was from her licking grease from the grill (old grease carrying god knows what bacteria) but now that's not an issue (new grill with doors to hide grease capture). She eats EVERYTHING IN SIGHT out of neurotic behavior (crayons, play dough, tissue, paper towels, sticks). But I can't see that causing a problem.Could it be from our tap water? We need\u00a0\u00a0new hot water tank although for her we obviously use cold water.Trying to figure this out. I don't want the vet to say she's got renal failure issues.",
