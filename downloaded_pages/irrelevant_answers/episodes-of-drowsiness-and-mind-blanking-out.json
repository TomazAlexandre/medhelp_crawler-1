    "question": "I keep having these strange episodes every day when I become very drowsy and my mind feels like it's blanking out and I can't concentrate. My vision also gets slightly blurry. It lasts for about 20-30 minutes (sometimes eating and drinking water helps) and generally occurs about two hours after getting up for the day. It seems like the harder I try to concentrate during the episode the worse it gets and I get nauseated. Before the episode occurs I've had 2-3 cups of coffee with hot chocolate in it and a small breakfast of peanut butter on bread or pop tarts. I'm a 32 year old female in fair health aside from smoking and anxiety and depression.",
