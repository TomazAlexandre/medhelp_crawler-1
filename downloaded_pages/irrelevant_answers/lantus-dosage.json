            "answer": "Is your doctor an Endocrinologist, a doctor who trained and specializes on the endocrine system - diabetes, thyroid, pancreas and kidney. If not you need to see one. Most regular doctor do not have the training to deal with diabetes issues like yours, they seem to be 'pill dispensers'. In your case, upping your basal dosage instead of evaluating and finding the root cause.The Endo should check your thyroid too. A malfunctioning thyroid will disrupt insulin production which can cause high glucose levels. Good luck",

            "answer": "Strongly recommend you try to see an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you have extreme insulin resistance, given you are taking such a high dose and still have this high sugars.Get a second opinion if need be.\u00a0\u00a0It is dangerous for your sugars to be this high for long.Are you taking metformin as well?\u00a0\u00a0This can help the insulin resistance.Another thing, is you need to be checked for any infection.\u00a0\u00a0Infection can raise your blood sugars and make it impossible to get them down.\u00a0\u00a0In particular see a dentist and also get your doctor to check if there is anything else going on that needs to be treated.\u00a0\u00a0A caution, if you do have an infection and they treat it your blood sugars could drop rapidly and you may have to adjust your insulin dramatically...\u00a0\u00a0Please be careful.A low carb diet may also help.\u00a0\u00a0You can google this. In particular you can look up Dr. Richard Bernstein and his book the Diabetes Solution.Let us know how you go.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you can get this calmed down soon.Exercise will help, but not now.\u00a0\u00a0You should not exercise with blood sugars this high.",

            "answer": "I take Lantus and I also take Metformin 500 mg. twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0I am on 20 units of Lantus and have taken Lantus for years. (I use to be on 40 units a day, until I lost 125 pounds)\u00a0\u00a0I have not been good about following my diet and I notice that my blood sugar readings have been higher.My fasting blood sugars have been higher than normal (around 175) but I know it's because I have been eating too many carbs and have gained 20 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0Weight really seems to have alot to do with diabetes, because after I lost 125 pounds, I was able to go off ALL diabetes medicine, while I kept my weight and eating under control.I do hope that you are seeing an Endo, just as the other two posts have said. They give you good advice.Please keep us updated about your progress and let us know when and if you are seeing an Endo.\u00a0\u00a0It's really that important.Bless you,Heather",

            "answer": "I'm on 80 u of Lantus at night and 50 u of novolog before I stick any food in my face. Some of us are very resistant. I had a nurse that monitored me for 6-8 weeks as I went onto insulin. And now that my HgA1c is high I will be seeing another team to work it down to a normal range.Not sure but my kidneys may not like metformin???----Disclaimer this is my personal dosing not to be used by anyone else----",
