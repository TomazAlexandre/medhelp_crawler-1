            "answer": "These neurological problems occur because of toxins we build up in our bodies.\u00a0\u00a0With me it was about the mercury I had in my teeth.\u00a0\u00a0Too many amalgams can give the body a burden it can't handle.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest you get the book Prescriptions for Nutritional Healing and investigate the supplements and vitamins you can take to help the body heal itself.\u00a0\u00a0Along with this investigate the \"Paleo diet\" which is a diet high in the raw fruits and vegetables which give the body the nutrients it needs to heal itself.",

    "question": "I really need some oppinions on this. I've been quite sick lately and no doc I go to will take me seriously. I have had tingling and pins and needles in my hassle and feet, increasing blurred vision - especially in my right eye, slurred speech, impaired memory (forgetting the way to the shops etc...), increased hunger, thirst and urination and fatigue, I'm constantly tired I've noticed it gets worse after eating. I had a fasting blood glucose test in April last year and it was 4 which is normal so my doc won't do any more testing for diabetes and he has reffered me to a neurologist asking about MS but I have to wait what could be six months to see one. I'm a 19 year old female, I have a normal weight (50 kgs) and am 5\"3 tall. I have asthma which is well controlled most of the time, I have recently found out I'm allergic to wheat and so have cut it out of my diet as much as I can. I have no family history of MS and only my great grandma had diabetes, I don't know what type. I'd really appreciate any advice you have. Thanks.",
