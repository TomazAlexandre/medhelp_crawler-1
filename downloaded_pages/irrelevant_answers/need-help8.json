            "answer": "Are you sure it isn't Terbutaline?\u00a0\u00a0The prescription actually says albuterol?\u00a0\u00a0The two are similar, but terbutaline is the drug that is usually used to stop preterm contractions on an outpatient basis.I'm not sure why anyone would use albuterol tablets.\u00a0\u00a0They certainly are not used to stop preterm contractions.You should be on limited activity if you aren't already.\u00a0\u00a0No working, no intercourse, no housework..just tv time on the couch, up and down to the bathroom only.\u00a0\u00a0 If you develop persistent contractions call your doctor back or go to the hospital, especially if the contractions are accompanied by any spotting or leakage of fluid.\u00a0\u00a0Your baby if born now would likely do ok ultimately, but would certainly spend some time in a nicu perhaps on a ventilator.\u00a0\u00a0If you can avoid that, by all means it would be best.\u00a0\u00a0After 34 weeks, you can breathe a little easier.\u00a0\u00a0Ultimately things would likely be ok now, but the baby would have a rocky start and no one wants that for their child.If the bottle says albuterol, I would call tomorrow and ask why you are being treated with that, as opposed to terbutaline.",

            "answer": "hi i dont no about the drug but i just wanted to let you no babys born around 34 weeks do very very well some not even needing a ventalator and as you said you have diabetes so atleast the weight advantage is there if the baby is born over 5 pounds they tend to have less problems then smaller babys\u00a0\u00a0there is a good chance your baby will be that weight at that stage i never had diabetes but my baby was 9 pounds at birth so i figure it must have been around 5 pounds at that age.good luck anyway.",

            "answer": "Hi, I don't know about the drug, but I don't think you should worry too much about your baby. You're practically at 33 weeks and even if the baby is born now, he probably won't be in too much trouble. I think the main thing you should worry about at this point are his lungs. Maybe you could ask your dr. - if you continue to dilate - if you don't need a shot to mature the lungs. Then, even if he comes early and has to spend some time in the NICU, as long as he doesn't need a ventilator it's not really scary.My twins were born at 36 week (I had also gestational diabetes) and my DS (5 lb 11) came home with me while DD (4 lb 2)had to stay in the NICU for 17 days. So she was small and they said she reacted and looked more like a 32 weeks baby. But her lungs were fine, she only needed the incubator to keep her warm and a little help eating (she had a feeding tube so she could sleep through some of the meals).Good luck!",

            "answer": "My friend had the exact same problem as you.. gestational diabetes and preterm labor.\u00a0\u00a0They gave her a drug (i think it was albuteral) to stop the contractions until she reached 36 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0She ended up being induced at 40 weeks!!!\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there.. and good luck with the birth of your son!!",

            "answer": "Hello, it is me again well to be exact the name of the prescripton is Albuterol sulfate 2mg tablets. And the reason I was asking about it because on the information page that they give with the prescription it says that it is for asthma and any other symtoms your doctor seems necessary for. And on the warnings it says if pregnant ask your doctor of the benefits of using while pregnant. But I guess my doctor knows what she is doing right?????????? I also wanted to thank everybody for the support on letting me know something about the chances of my baby if he decides to come early I am really trying to relax and keep him in there just a bit longer I want him to stay at least till 37 weeks I am officially 33 weeks today.So 4 more looonnnnggggg weeks to go. And yes he is getting big I can feel him already right under my rib cage when he moves poor thing doesn't have much room to move. Well thank you again.",

            "answer": "Albuterol is not used to stop preterm contractions.Terbutaline is, or magnesium sulfate.Infants of diabetic mothers tend to have later lung maturity than other infants.\u00a0\u00a0Weight is not a predictor of how the baby of a diabetic mother will do.\u00a0\u00a0Infants of diabetic mothers born at almost 33 weeks will almost certainly have problems breathing, regardless of size.\u00a0\u00a0Utimately, these infants do well, but in the short term they often can and do need ventilatory support for breathing.\u00a0\u00a0So the best thing is to delay delivery as long as possible.\u00a0\u00a0After 34 weeks, you can breathe a bit easier, but the baby will likely still have problems at first.In addition to respiratory problems preterm infants have problems feeding, maintaining their body temps, and with blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0ULTIMATELY, they do fine with good treatment, but if they can be kept inside the mother for a couple more weeks thats the best thing.",

    "question": "Hello, It's me again have not posted in a while but I am needing to know if anybody has gone through something similiar. I am 32 weeks and 6 days pregnant and have gestational diabetes and have been having contractions for about a week as of today went to my OB on Thursday and she did a internal exam and she said that the contractions that I have been having have indeed causing me to dialate as she could place her finger tip in my cervix. Well she gave me a pill named Albuterol and I take it every 6 hrs. It has slowed them down but I am still having them. Not as often but still. And she said we needed to try to keep him (IT\"S A BOY! after 5 Girls and 15 years of waiting to try again) in a while longer my due date is 5-15-06 and she told me that she is not going to let me go to my due date baecause the baby is getting big with the diabetes and I am measuring bigger than I am week wise. Well my question is that if anybody has heard of using the Albuterol to help my problem she said it is to relax the uterus so that I will not burst my bag of waters. But everybody that I talk to say that Albuterol is only used to treat asthma. I am kind of scared being that I am still having the contractions and having pressure down below. I have another appt. on Thursday I guess she wants to see if I have not dilated anymore. And does anybody know if I do end up having my baby in the following weeks 2-3? Will he be okay? I will be waitng for your opinions and sorry for the long post. THANKS TO EVERYBODY THAT TAKES THE TIME TO READ MY POST. MAY GOD BLESS YOU ALL.",
