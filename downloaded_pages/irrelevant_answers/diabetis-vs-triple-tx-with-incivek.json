            "answer": "Hello, I read this forum because my 20-year-old daughter has Hep C Gen 1a. Can you contact the hospital and see if they can contact your doctor or perhaps you should go to ER instead of waiting more than another day. Your treatment mess can affect your diabetes medication. Good luck with your treatment.",

            "answer": "I think your instinct to adjust your dose until you can talk to your doctor is a good idea. I know there are a lot of issues (and threads) about insulin resistance &/or diabetes as they relate to Hepatitis C.It seems likely you might need a dose adjustment - then again it could be something else. You have a way to test your blood sugar so you will see soon enough if whatever adjustment you make helps.I hope this worked out. I suppose you already went to bed. Sleep tight!!",

I've read somewhere that amongst the many autoimmune disorders that HCV can trigger, one of these is a form of diabetes. I've suffered autoimmune arthritis for decades now and have been given reason to hope it would improve with tx (I'm still waiting). Perhaps your HCV had caused an autoimmune reaction against your insulin-producing cells, and perhaps they are recovering now. That would be fabulous news. Be sure to let us know what your doctor says, and in the meantime I would suggest doing blood sugar tests with almost ridiculous frequency. I hope you get great news from your doc!",
