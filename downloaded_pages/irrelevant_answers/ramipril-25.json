            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Ramipril belongs in a class of drugs called angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. ACE inhibitors are used for treating high blood pressure, heart failure and for preventing kidney failure due to high blood pressure and diabetes.ACE is important because it is an enzyme responsible for producing the chemical, angiotensin II. Angiotensin II causes muscles in most arteries, including the arteries of the heart, to contract, thereby narrowing the arteries and elevating blood pressure. ACE inhibitors such as ramipril lower blood pressure by reducing the production of angiotensin II, thereby relaxing arterial muscle and enlarging arteries.In the kidneys, the narrowing of the arteries by angiotensin II decreases blood flow. ACE inhibitors enlarge and reduce the blood pressure in the arteries going to the kidney. This reduces damage to the kidneys caused by high blood pressure with out interrupting with the blood flow to the kidney.Hope this information helps.Best.",

            "answer": "My doctor just prescribed Ramipril 2.5 mg yesterday because my Microalbumin/Creatinine is 39, which is out of range (reference range is < 30 mcg/mg creatinineI took one cap last night and this morning I felt tired and a little dizzy and I skipped my morning work out. I called my doctor office to ask him, but it's closed.Would you please give me some advice about this medication? I don't know if Microalbumin/Creatinine is high because of diabetes or because of exercise (three hours a day).I was diagnosed with diabetes in January (A1C at the time was 7.5).A1C now is 5.4 due to intensive exercise and strict diet.Thank you very much in advance.Ken",
