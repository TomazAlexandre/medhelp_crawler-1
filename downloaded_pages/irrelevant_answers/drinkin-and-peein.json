Floods of urine about every two hours, while sleeping, while moving, you name it.\u00a0\u00a0Gonna call the vet back Monday, but would appreciate any input.My house is up for sale, and pee-soaked everything is *not* helping! At this point I have a human\u00a0\u00a0incontinence pad down on the sofa and am trying to confine her to it (she's not happy).",

    "question": "Our new country song title :-)My 12yr old pit has been sucking down water like she is on prednisone which of course causes her to pee. A lot. Often in her sleep. She has been on Proin for several years for spay incontinence which has worked wonderfully. She is at the highest safe dose of the Proin.This started about 6 weeks ago. She has had complete blood workup, including a complete thyroid panel, as well as urinalysis which was all clear. She is squarely in the normal range on everything, nothing even a little high. Her urine is diluted from the drinking, but clear of bacteria and blood cells. No infections, diabetes, other kidney problems or liver problems.The only thing the vet could come up with was she is possibly very sensitive to a steroid eye drop. She only got one drop in each eye per day. We took her off the drops for a week with no change. Now, due to emergency surgery (see cataract thread) she is back on the drops. She is also on dorzolamide drops and latanoprost drops which neither the regular vet or the ophthalmologist thinks could cause this.I don't think it is a sudden worsening of the spay incontinence because of the drinking. Also, she is not leaking, when she goes it's a flood. Either when I don't let her out quite often enough or when she is deeply asleep.Any brilliant ideas?",
