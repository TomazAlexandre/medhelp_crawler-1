    "question": "I am being screened for type 2 Diabetes. My mother has it, my grandfather had it and my brother is borderline.I have been testing my blood sugar and it ranges from fasting 88 to 156 2hrs after meals. My physicians assistant insists these are normal swings in a day. If I don't eat dinner or try not to eat, my blood sugar is\u00a0\u00a0high when I wake up. I can't seem to find a pattern. I had gestational diabetes and was thought to have it after high school, but was told if I kept my weight down, I'd be fine. I have a sweet taste in my mouth, my vision is fuzzy when I'm hungry and I get shakes whenaim hungry. My fingertips are numb. The physicians assistant says my sugar would be much higher ifI were diabetic. I'm confused. I am taking 3 Ac tests over 3 months. Any input? Maybe Im pre diabetic and it isn't showing up on my labs.",
