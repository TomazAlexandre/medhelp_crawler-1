            "answer": "I checked it out and have a couple of comments to add about the site. Unlike this forum, which is set up specifically for discussion about type 1 diabetes (even though many visitors to this site seem to be type 2), the site mentioned here seems to encompass all types of diabetes. There is even a posting with a question about treatment of a diabetic border collie! Please do take note that the two types of diabetes are VERY different in treatment and in cause. So information that is specific to one type may not apply at all to the other type.So just be careful when reading hints on the web... make sure that the advice pertains to your particular type of diabetes. In any event, this forum did look interesting. Thanks to sfndiabetes for sharing it with us.",
