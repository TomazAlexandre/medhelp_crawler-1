            "answer": "You can always refuse. You can refuse any medical advice you'd like. But 1st try to explain yourself calmly and just ask that you'd like more time. Also remember that if you are uncomfortable with your Dr's plan - get a 2nd opinion or switch Dr's.\u00a0\u00a0YOU are in charge of your care and YOU have to live with the decisions made for your care. Don't let them bully you into something you're not happy with.If you do u agree that there is a medical reason you should be induced, you can try nipple stimulation, walking, chiropractic care, and acupuncture. Stay hydrated.",
