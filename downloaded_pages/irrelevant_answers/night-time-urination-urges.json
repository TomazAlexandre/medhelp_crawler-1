            "answer": "Hi,Intestitial cystitis requires a complete medical history and a complete physical examination.All other possible diagnoses like an infection, obstruction, stones, structural anomalies, varices and other systemic disease like diabetes need to be excluded. Urgency in urination may require further evaluation. A urinalysis with urine culture may be able to help rule out infections. IC usually comes with pain and also may cause a degree of pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse.I suggest that a consult with a urologist will be able to help.At this point IC may only be a differential.Keep us posted for anything.",
