            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your friend\u2019s medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0He needs a complete neuro-psychiatric assessment because he also appears to be having some psychological/psychiatric issues (his visions of strange creatures and monsters whilst awake). The physical symptoms of tremors/spasms etc could be due to a manifestation of this psychiatric problem or could be due to electrolyte imbalance, peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, hyper and hypothyroidism, lupus, and Lyme\u2019s. Multiple sclerosis, Parkinsonism, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, low vitamin B12 or low vitamin D, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. and certain epilepsies too could be the cause. It can be benign fasciculation syndrome if all causes are ruled out.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please ask your friend to consult his doctor regarding the above mentioned possibilities. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

    "question": "I'm worried about a friend of mine. His health has taken a bad turn in the last year, he has started to have small seizures, frequent localised muscle seizures in his arms and legs, he sometimes falls over unconscious for no apparent reason. He is naseous most of the time and has trouble focusing on what is being said to him during a conversation. Most frightening to me are his reports of horrifying night terrors which cause him significant distress and disrupt his, as well as his visions of strange creatures and monsters whilst awake. These take various forms, some benign and some which feel threatening to him. Some area associated with specific locations or events. He will be seeing a neurologist at some point, but I am trying to make sense of what could be happening to him. Are the night terrors, seizures and so on related to a form of epilepsy perhaps? He is only 24 years old.",
