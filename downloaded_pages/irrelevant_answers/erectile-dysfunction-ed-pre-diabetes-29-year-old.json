            "answer": "Hi, I recently did a water fasting and that was difficult in the first couple of days but I lost some weight, can breath easier and feel better and calm now. There is also some data that water fasting is also useful for people suffering from diabetes type 2 (but it's absolutely contraindicated for diabetes type 1!)So perhaps you might consider trying a supervised water fasting course?",

            "answer": "Hello,Sexual problem or weakness is also known as erectile dysfunction. The causes are many like diabetes, depression, autonomic nervous system problem, excessive alcohol ingestion or tobacco smoking etc. You may need to consult your doctor to see which amongst these causes are responsible for your problem. Even prediabetes can cause erectile dysfunction. This does not usually need drugs to be controlled and glucose levels can be brought under control with good exercise and diet control.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi AllI started masturbating when I was 20 yrs and now I just turned 30 (5'10.5, 197 pounds, BMI 28%) and almost 10 yrs I have been masturbating to porn or in shower with imagination. Also, I have had happy ending massages since 24 yrs old (1 or 2/month) but have never been able to ejaculate when the lady strokes ... I always switch to my hand and ejaculate. I have had some sexual encounters but I cannot *** during penetration sex or ** .. I need to stroke and finish. My question about ejaculation is .. How can I *** when I am getting a ** or penetration sex?Now about erections ... I used to never think about erections at all until one day (Feb2013) I was with my gorgeous girlfriend we watched a basketball game and drank 2 bottles of beer and we went to my place and I wanted to ram her ... but my penis was just semi hard ... and her ** .. HJ and penetration did not get it hard .. she then cried and soon broke up without one more sex chance ... Ever since I have tried to have sex with a few others but even if I am hard initially I will go semi hard in 5-10 minutes. So I tried to use the liquors store male enhancement pill (Zen) this gives me the hard erection for about 3-4 days but also gives me unusual headaches, tingling at fingers tips and lower back pain which is not at all pleasant. If someone knows are these pills at liquor stores safe for use?\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, now during wathcing porn I might get erections (not very hard like before) which last for sometime (5-15 mins) and then go soft and again I might get some semi hard erection ... but I will get only semi soft erection during sex with a girl if I dont use the pills. I have used pills for about 6-7 times after my feb2013 episode of going soft. I cannot anymore get hard by grinding, or just making out with a girl after the feb2013 incident. I had been a pre-diabetic in early 2012 but I got under control in six months with strict diet and exercise. But in early 2013 once I got that gorgeous girl I was eating again normal ... and after her break up .. have been eating a lot of junk also .. just to put on weight and look big (now my weight 197 lbs). I was about 160 lbs in early 2013 when with my GF.\u00a0\u00a0I just checked my blood sugar again now i am getting consistent fasting blood sugar readings over 100 ..so I am again back to pre-diabetic. I have made changes already.Anyway, ,my question .. I think my ED is mostly related to pre-diabetic .. so if I reverse my pre-diabetic will I be able to achieve normal erections again?\u00a0\u00a0or is the damage to my arteries irreversible?\u00a0\u00a0Also, is there any exercises diet that will help my ED condition now?\u00a0\u00a0 Also if you can suggest any tests to confirm my ED with prediabetiese I will get it done.Please help me out Thanks much",
