            "answer": "Hi there!I cannot confirm anything without a complete general and central nervous system examination. It is possible that these symptoms could be due to stroke. Damage to the left side of the brain can weaken or paralyze the right side of the body. Single or multiple clots or blockages in the small vessels of the brain cause small strokes.Lacunar strokes, usually occur from long standing high blood pressure or diabetes. These blockages and resultant strokes can occur on both the left and right side of the brain. Cerebral embolism, thrombosis, aneurysm and hemorrhage are other causes of stroke. Seek the opinion of a neurologist urgently. A clinical examination and investigations like MRI brain, lipid profile and other parameters may be helpful. I do hope it helps.Take care and regards!",
