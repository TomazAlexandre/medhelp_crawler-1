            "answer": "I am like that.\u00a0\u00a0I have been depressed and had anxiety disorder since I was 3 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 24 and have finally gotten a handle on it.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has told me that I may need (probably will need to) take the medication (Zoloft and Trazadone) for the rest of my life.\u00a0\u00a0That really doesn't bother me though because taking the medication is a lot easier than dealing with anxiety and depression. (I did quit taking it once and the anxiety and depression came back worse than ever).\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "Is it within the realm of possibility that a person will be depressed their whole life? I have been on antidepressants for years and everytime that I try to wean myself off of them I feel like I can't handle even ordinary every day problems. I get anxious and explosive and feel very hopeless. Are there people like this?",
