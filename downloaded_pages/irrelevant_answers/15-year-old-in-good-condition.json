            "answer": "Well my very first thought here was that this is classic for early-stage kidney failure! Yet you say her kidneys check out just fine....Did the vet run a complete full blood-panel on her? And her Creatinine and Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) were in normal parameters? Also Blood Phosphorus?Those are the things to keep an eye on with Renal disease.Has she been losing any fur, or has any thin or bare patches on her?There is another test, known as a \"Cortisol-Creatinine Ratio Test\" which will test for Cushing's. (Heavy drinking/urinating can be a symptom of Cushing's too)",

            "answer": "Is she taking any medications besides the antibiotics or bladder control med.?\u00a0\u00a0If so, check into the possible side effects.I would also have her thyroid checked, and her liver. If she is having trouble with either one of these, they can cause lethargy and increased thirst (polydypsia) and increased urination ( polyuria ).All that is required is a blood test, to determine the thyroid and liver function.Best wishes.",

    "question": "My parents have a 15 year old peek a poo and she is in very good health and very active for her age.\u00a0\u00a0Recently she began drinking a lot of water, always drinking.\u00a0\u00a0Going to the bathroom a lot and when she is in a deep sleep she sometimes has pee accidents. She was taken to the vet for a check to see if she had diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0No diabetes. Her heart checked out good as well as her kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0She was put on an antibotic, and some rx to help control her bladder.\u00a0\u00a0Seemed to help for a short while but now she is not active, still drinking a lot, and now doesn't seem interested in eating.\u00a0\u00a0What could be the problem?\u00a0\u00a0I know she is old but heart and kidneys are good.Thanks,Kathy",
