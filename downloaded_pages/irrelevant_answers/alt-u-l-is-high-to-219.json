            "answer": "From the Mayo ClinicSee:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/blood-sugar/SA00102\"Random blood sugar testWhat is a random blood sugar test?Measures your blood sugar at any point in time, not necessarily a certain amount of time after a meal, snack or beverage.What's normal?A normal random blood sugar level hasn't been clearly defined. However, even if you've recently eaten and your blood sugar level is at its peak, your random blood sugar level shouldn't be higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).What level suggests prediabetes?Although no clear criteria have been established, a level higher than 140 mg/dL (7.8 mmol/L) but lower than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L), may indicate prediabetes. Your doctor may recommend additional testing.What level suggests type 1 or type 2 diabetes?A level higher than 200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) suggests either type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Remember, your blood sugar level alone isn't enough to differentiate between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may do other tests to determine which type of diabetes you have.\"It's not clear that your blood glucose is high or that you have diabetes. the time and the content of your food consumption prior to the test have a lot to do with whether your glucose is high. It appears that you may be pre-diabetic at worst and you could very well be within normal depending on when and what you ate before the test.Mike",
