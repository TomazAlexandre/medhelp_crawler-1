            "answer": "Hi there, symptoms have been tough, I've had nausea, loss of appetite, fatigue and headaches since 6.5 weeks and I am now 12.5 weeks. I've also caught a gastro bug(would you believe?!) this week which has meant I've added dihorrea and vomiting to the mix. I usually run regularly and have tried to keep it up where possible but sometimes I've just needed to rest. Apart from that I've been really excited to see our new little person on the ultrasound last week! That makes it all worthwhile :-)",
