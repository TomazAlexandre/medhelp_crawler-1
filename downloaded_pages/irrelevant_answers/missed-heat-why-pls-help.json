    "question": "Hello all and I hope everyone fur babies are well. I have a 3 yr old st bernard and she been in heat few times before but she had a small one this spring and missed her all the way this fall and I was wondering is this normal. Also last week or so she kind of acts like she may be going into heat?????I took her to the vet a month ago cause she was itching like crazy and I mean it was awful she had dug holes into her and hot spots. I changed her dog food a friend of mine is a vet tech and she said to take her off any dog food that has red 40 in it or red dye so I did and that helped some but not enough so vet gave her a shot and some prednisdne 10mg and said to take one every other day after day two she had stopped itching all together and when give her bath make sure and rinse her very good. But since she has been acting like she was going into heat been itching a little not much at all but little. Any advise or info pls help me help her. Thanx in advance.",
