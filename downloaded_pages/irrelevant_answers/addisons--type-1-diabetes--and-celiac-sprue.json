            "answer": "(Submitted the above post without completion-my apologies)#1)Knowing what we do about Celiac Sprue and a few of the relative comparisons that one \"Might\" be able to distinguish between the condition and that of intestinal Candidiasis, might there exist the possibilty at least that \"Some of this\" might involve a defect with Beta-glucanase and/or Xylanase?#2)Is the medical community fully confident that TB and Candidiasis are not one and of the same. Is there any legitimite room for debate on such a theory?#3)Why is it that Candida AB's are appearing across the board among those infected with Giardia Lamblia in the latest Euro studies? Could it be that a few of us with Type 1 are those that are the rare \"Lifelong carriers\" of Giardia Lamblia? If so, where might they be hiding? For those of you that might understand something about any of this, the question is not meant to be a joke, believe it or not.I address these questions specifically to any of the medical professionals that may be able to shed some light on these types of questions. For the rest of you, the \"Commoners like me,\" I would highly advise you to refrain yourselves from such \"In depth research~\" or you too will be a step away from entering an insane asylum like me~. I'm not kidding about that, either~.I applaud any medical professional that ever made it through their 12+ years. 10:1 odds says that 90% of the population would succomb to the grips of insanity two years into this stuff~.Thanks so much, everyone.",

            "answer": "Hi Fullmergavin,I don't know the answers to your questions but I know of someone who seems to do heaps of research into these topics, and also has reams of useful and relevant links. If you google 'Bernstein diabetes website forum' and look up posts by G.Debussy, you should be able to track down relevant posts/links and a means of pm-ing to dig up specific info.Hope this helps. Good luck!",

    "question": "When I was first diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes as an infant, I had broken out with systemic Candidiasis, followed by lactic acidosis (Which makes sense to me now), which led to the diagnosis.Five years ago, I began to become quite pale, and soon broke out with a skin rash on the arms that was consistent with the pigmentation disorders that can be common among diabetics.After going through years of panic attacks, racing heartbeats, periods of disorientation/confusion, sweating, etc, I was finally diagnosed with \"Borderline Addison's Disease\" (Ie-probably more accurately-adrenal insufficiency), via 21-hydroxylase and ACTH.Shortly thereafter, I had relapses of a low grade fever and a cough, which led to a TB diagnosis. Working on a hunch, the Endo checked for Candida AB's-positive. I was prescribed two anti fungal meds-energy levels returned, skin rash-gone, cortisol and ACTH back to normal, minor improvement in A1C (6.0% to 5.3%-no change in basals).Questions-",
