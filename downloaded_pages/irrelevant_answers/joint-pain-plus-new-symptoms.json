            "answer": "I forgot to mention my most bizarre symptom. I like to do things sitting on the floor, strange I know, but recently, when I'm sitting on the floor, I get the strangest sensations in my legs. First, they get really hot. I continue sitting because I really don't think anything of it, but then I start feeling like all the nerve endings in me legs are having a party. It's hard to explain the sensation, except that I feel like my legs are full of boiling water-- not because they're hot, but because it feels like everything in my legs is bubbling. It's the most bizarre thing, but it's not really uncomfortable, just a little off-putting and distracting. I've also had dry, itchy skin all over my body, as well as rashes on the forearms. Thanks!",

The thirst, vision problems, and headaches could be signs of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The pain in your legs could be lupus.\u00a0\u00a0Other things you mention sound like hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Blood work would rule out a lot of diagnosis...especially blood sugar, ANA, TSH and potassium levels.\u00a0\u00a0If your rheumatologist won't order the tests, your GP should be able to.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes.",

            "answer": "So I forgot more things. My hands and feet are sweaty and cold. I sometimes get this really queer feeling on the pinky side of my right hand where if I rub it, not touch it, it gets really hypersensitive. It happens other places too, but mostly on the side of my right hand. I also crave strange foods like lentils and tomato sauce. My lips are always always chapped, and no amount of medicated lip balm will help remedy that. My hands and feet swell up a lot too.",

            "answer": "I was also thinking Sjogren's Syndrome, even before I saw the other commets. You do need to get autoimmune tests done. ANA, Sed-rate, SS-A and SS-B antibodies. There is actually a long list, but the web page I need is not working right now. I will post again later if I can access the list though. An Opthamologist can diagnose Sjogren's, or find why you're having problems with your eyes. You should not neglect to get tested for Diabetes though. That was also a good suggestion.",

One thing is obvious, you need a complete work-up by your physician and I agree with lhowell about getting a glucose level (blood sugar), ANA, TSH. But I also believe you should get a CBC/DIFF, tests to rule out Sjogren's, RF and screening for hepatitis and to rule lyme disease.",

Then, recently, I've been having strange pains in the middle of my second-to-last rib on my right side when I life my right arm. I've also been thirsty all the time, and I have headaches. I've been urinating all the time, and it's neon yellow. My eyes are incessantly dry, and when I stand up after laying or sitting for along time my vision goes all sorts of colours and I have to sit back down, at which point that goes away and I'm fine. Sometimes when I wake up in the morning I can't move becuase my body is so tired. I've been to a rheumatologist, and she told me that it was nothing to worry about, but I definitely am worrying.",
