            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Burning sensation in the genitals, along with low back pain and pain while urination can be symptoms of STD.Usually these symptoms are followed by blisters. It is very difficult to tell without a clinical exam. This could also be symptom of neuropathy due to diabetes and B12 deficiency.I would suggest you to get yourself clinically evaluated by your PCP.Take care!",

            "answer": "So this is a really old post but I get the very same burning. Its my privates, thighs and stomach mostly. It started after (during) an extreme panic attack and is now often. I have no known std, no issues with urination, no back pain. I do have a panic disorder and that's what the doctors say it is..caused by anxiety and that it's \"all in my head\" not real burning that I just think I am. Does that make sense. Could they be right or do you think there is more going on? I don't know how my B12 is right now (I'm vegetarian almost a yr now and haven't supplemented yet)\u00a0\u00a0and I was tested in the past for diabetes and was not (few yrs ago I think). Also the right side of my face mysteriously started tingling about a week before this panic attack came on and my face has been tingling 24/7 since (about 4 months now). They did a cat scan and it was normal. Any thoughts?",
