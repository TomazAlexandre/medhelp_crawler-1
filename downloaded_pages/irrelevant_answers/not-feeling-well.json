            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of chronic nausea and morning nausea is acidity, apart from ofcourse pregnancy in women. Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral if required. Hope this helps. Take care!",
