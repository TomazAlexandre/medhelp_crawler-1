I've been booked for a sweep next week when I'll be 40+5 but hopefully I'll either not need it or it will be enough to get me going like it was last time. If it doesnt work they will start with the gel when I am 12days over before moving onto the more intrusive methods. I would def chat with your doc, they should be happy to leave you alone or should have a very good reason to give you if they feel it is the best thing for you :)",
