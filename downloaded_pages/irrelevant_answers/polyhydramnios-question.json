            "answer": "I had polyhydramnios with my second child. From 27 weeks on I started measuring 5-7 weeks ahead on the fundal height measurement. I had so much fluid that on the afi index it was 27.5 at 41 weeks! I was miserable, it is generally a sign of a big baby or can be a result of gestational diabetes. In my case, it enabled my son to make a huge movement at the end and tie a true knot in his cord. If it is too high of a concern, sometimes docs can withdraw fluid, but that isn't done all that often. Hopefully your doc with keep an eye on things. Good news is in my case, despite a very scary delivery due to the knot, my son was born very healthy at 8 1/2 lbs. I didn't have gd, so they have no idea why I had too much fluid, we'll see if I have the same problem this time around.Andi",
