After that, the procession is roughly 1 cat year to 4 human years. So... your cat is probably about 55-60 (I don't remember the scale above ten years but I believe it changes to about a 1 to 2 or 1 to 3 ratio.How long they can live...depends entirely on the cat and their diet (I\u00a0\u00a0know, not very helpful, sorry but it's true).I will say the oldest diabetic cat I've seen was 16.",
