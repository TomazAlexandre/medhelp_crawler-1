            "answer": "Dear saddoo,since i don't understand your request as i'm just another type 1 diabetic trying to help. i also have no clue as to what type of reports you want to send. We wouldn't be the best place to go over your blood glucose reports and that is something for your doctor to do as he or she is more familiar with your case.good luck, bret",

            "answer": "BL is correct that we have no means whereby someone can send us reports. Furthermore, we cannot diagnose illnesses on the web. Our purpose in this Forum is to instigate conversation that may help educate people who live with this disease (share the \"tricks of the trade\" so to speak) so that they can better take care of themselves. We also can send people to local Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation chapters so that they can find other families who deal with this disease in order to find local support. But again, we are not doctors, and we cannot offer a medical diagnosis for any of the people who write to us, so sending us any kind of report probably is not the way to go. I would suggest that you call your doctor and ask him the question you are writing to us. He should be able to help you once you explain your situation.",
