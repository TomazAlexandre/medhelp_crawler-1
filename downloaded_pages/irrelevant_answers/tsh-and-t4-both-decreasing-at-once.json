    "question": "Hi,I'm new to this forum, so thanks for bearing with me. In late 2004, I had a toxic goiter & prob. with both the TSH & regular T4 both going decreasing at once. At that time my symptoms were pretty indicative of hyperthyroidism. One doc. told me to totally stop taking Synthroid, another started me back on it. My body went haywire.Now, I've had the TSH tested by my endo. & internist both within about a week. The endo.'s TSH finding was 7; the internist's was 2 (one wk. later!) The internist's test also showed the regular T4 (one that usually ranges from 4 - 12) is only 5 something; in Dec. '06 it was almost 9.Internist told me if both #'s are dropping, it could indicate pituitary problem. Did anyone else ever encounter this?? I am pretty desperate as feeling both hypothyroid & hyper at once. My b.p is high for me, glucose also, and doc. put me on mild dose of beta blockers. Thirst is excessive & I'm more hungry lately too. Diabetes has been ruled out already.Worst part is internist was very nonchalant (I had to prod him for results after waiting to hear for a wk.) I actually had to remind him he had mentioned pituitary, adenoma, etc. to me. Endo. did a 24-hr. urine test for cortisol etc. but no results yet.Did you ever feel like the docs. just didn't care what you were going through??!! It's very frustrating, esp. since both of them are aware this landed me in the hospital a few yrs. back (they pinned it on the goiter then, but I'll bet there was an underlying cause or condition that was never found). Heavy sigh. Meanwhile trying to keep working full-time.Thanks in advance for any feedback!, it's appreciated.-Megan",
