            "answer": "Psoriasis, Dermatitis, Scabies, and hives are all ruled out due to there being no physical skin issues. I have no red marks, no bumps, no rash. I mentioned this in my original post. Lice is also ruled out due to no bugs being visible and it is all over my body- even the parts where there is no hair.Internal issues is my next guess, hence why I want to get some bloodwork done. I don't believe that it's allergies, however, due to the random and recent spreading of the itch from localized to my legs to all over my body and face. Also, I have changed my soaps and cosmetics numerous times to no relief. I also have this feeling constantly, even when I am not wearing clothes. I have had a substantial allergy test done and I am allergic to no foods (but yes, many other things such as trees and animals... all of which should lighten up when I took the Zyrtec, or Allergra, or Claritin.. but I am not finding any relief with any of these.)",

    "question": "So I was reading a very similar question on here that was dated back to 2006. Everyone who replied (all 630 of them) basically were just complaining about their similar symptoms- but they weren't similar. For the last three years I have had intense itching (I scratch to the point that I bleed, and I'm not a masochist) with no rash, hives, or welts forming. The first two years it was pretty localized to my legs, but it has spread within the last six months to all over my body- back, stomach, arms, face, everywhere. The only reason I can see is that it started right after I moved into my new apartment (but same area, regionally, and I don't understand why that would happen). I have tried every cortisone cream, every medicated lotion, every non-medicated lotion, Zyrtec, Allegra, Claritin, Flonase, everything. A dermatologist has diagnosed me with dermatographism, but I disagree. The most adverse reaction I've seen from my scratching is that some hives MAY form if I've itched it PROFUSELY for an extended period of time. But they are small and very infrequent and very few. I saw another dermatologist for a second opinion and he said that he agrees, and prescribed me a higher-powered antihistamine that I can only take at night along with a steroid lotion- neither of which has seemed to have any effect (besides the prescription antihistamine which knocks me out... Benadryl can do that for much cheaper.)I'm at a loss. I'm considering getting blood tests done to check my thyroid and liver to make sure all is okay with that. Next step may be parasites. I have no food allergies and use hypoallergenic topical products. I'm also considering taking capsules full of lemon, peppermint, and lavender oils.. apparently this has helped a few. Does anyone else have this issue that has gained any relief from anything?!",
