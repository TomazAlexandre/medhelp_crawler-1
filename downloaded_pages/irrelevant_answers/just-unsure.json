            "answer": "My pom has a horsed cough like noise in spells and triggers a gagging and a trew cough, it is not quite stridor, but makes me think of it. It happens during exalation (not inpiration phase), it seems to get alliviates when he is awaiting a food he likes. But at night he goes thru spells. I am concerned that his musces will get tired and will wuit breathing. As a small breed, he has the collapsable trachea, some reflux (not bad) and after seen the vet, was diagnosed with hypothroidism. Was prescribed lasix, clindamycin (antibiotic) and supposely is stable. I have my reservations with how advanced Veterinary medicine is and how truely they arrive to a diagnosis and target the underling true condition. I am sure his larynx is irritated and triggers more croupiness-like repirations. I am a pediatrician and I have no clue about his condition. If anyone out there has an opinion or some concrete and clinical8based evidence of what the problem may be, or what suspected outcome or treatment, I will highly appreciated. please, feel free to email me at ***@****. Thank you, Louis",

    "question": "Our dog, J.C., was sitting on the floor with us the other night and suddenly started to breathe, solely, through his nose and started making loud snorting noises like he was unable to breathe..\u00a0\u00a0He was having a\u00a0\u00a0very hard time breathing for about 20 seconds and i had him lay down. We thought he was either having a heart attack or a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0After about 30 seconds, he was breathing normally, but obviously shaken up (as were we!).\u00a0\u00a0He has also had some rapid breathing occasionally and seems to get overheated while sleeping sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0He has also had an occasional runny nose (clear) and discharge from his right eye (which seems to be going away now).\u00a0\u00a0J.C. has diabetes and is a bit overweight (but we're working on that). We know he should see the vet, but wanted to post this to see what anyone thinks may be going on with J.C..\u00a0\u00a0Thank you, in advance, for any suggestions or comments.",
