I got rid of the infection a couple months ago though and the smell is still there but it's definitely worse if I've been holding it for a while.I drink mostly soda so I'm thinking about switching to juice or something and seeing if that changes it. Or maybe lots of water to ensure that it's not just sitting in there.",

She tested it and basically it was just a high pH (very alkaline) so I drink apple cider vinegar occasionally to keep my urine pH at a normal level.\u00a0\u00a0She wasn't worried in my situation at all... I was just more grossed out than anything.So, just ask your doc/midwife to check your urine.",
