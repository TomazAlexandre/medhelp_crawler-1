    "question": "Hi Everyone, I'm kittyface, unfortunately I've been posting in many forums as of late.I was dx with 513 blood sugar (6 months ago it was 150 and NP didn't catch it -- she apologized).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I've been feeling better since I'm down to 124 fasting but still having shortness of breath while talking and sitting.\u00a0\u00a0And I don't talk that much only cuz I can't.\u00a0\u00a0:)Anyway I'm just wondering if any of you had same shortness of breath and if so did the diabetes injure your heart and did your blessed heart recover with medication?Thanks,A Scared Kittyface",
