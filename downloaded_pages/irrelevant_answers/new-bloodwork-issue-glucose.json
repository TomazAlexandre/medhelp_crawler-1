            "answer": "Congratulations as you wind down treatment. A blood glucose level of 30 should have you on the floor; *definitely* follow up on this. I\u2019ve been testing blood sugar for years now (4x day) and have never experienced anything below 42. Most people start to feel faint, develop sweats, shakes, and begin to lose feeling in their lips and tongue about 50; if you experience any of these symptoms, take 2-3 tablespoons sugar (or buy glucose tabs at the pharmacy). DO address this with your PCP doctor though\u2026 I imagine it is lab error, but check into it.Hopefully others will check in with their thoughts. Take good care-Bill",

            "answer": "Here's how the effects of tx on blood sugar were explained to me.\u00a0\u00a0Not very scientific, but the doc brought it down to my level of understanding.\u00a0\u00a0Blood cells have normal life span of 90-120 days.\u00a0\u00a0During that life span the cells pick up glucose and then die their normal death.\u00a0\u00a0During that lifetime they can gather a lot of glucose and that's when a person tests high for blood sugar using a glucose meter (finger stick reader things) and by the test\u00a0\u00a0hbac1 which gives sort of a 90 day average.\u00a0\u00a0When riba is introduced into you diet, via tx, riba does it's thing as a red blood cell killer.\u00a0\u00a0That's why a lot of people get anemic.\u00a0\u00a0It kills the blood cells at a younger age, before they've accumulated a lot of glucose in their travels.\u00a0\u00a0Thus, lower blood sugar/glucose reading.\u00a0\u00a0If that's the case, the absence of riba in your diet will likely stop the killing madness and might get you back to more lofty levels.\u00a0\u00a0Again, this was the story the doc told me, but keep in mind I was on tx and he thought I was an idiot.",

            "answer": "FLGuy, I don't believe that glucose readings (finger stick readings or lab fasting glucose levels) are affected by hemolytic anemia. What is affected is your HbA1c level and that is due to the reasons you set forth. The RBCs do not live for the normal 90 to 120 days and therefore the readings can be lower than they would be otherwise. This is because there is less glycosylated hemoglobin accumulation than would be the case if the RBCs were more mature. Since they are younger - say 30 to 60 days old - they have less glycosylated hemoglobin.\"HbA1c is a test that measures the amount of glycosylated hemoglobin in your blood. Glycosylated hemoglobin is a molecule in red blood cells that attaches to glucose (blood sugar). You have more glycosylated hemoglobin if you have more glucose in your blood.\"From: http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003640.htmLadyLaurie, I don't think hemolytic anemia explains your glucose reading of 30. As stated, this is hypoglycemia, assuming the result is accurate. I suspect that reading\u00a0\u00a0may be inaccurate if, in fact, you did not feel any symptoms. A blood glucose of 30 would be extremely uncomfortable for the average person. The only exception that I know about is type 1 diabetics on insulin therapy who, after a long history of treating the disease, no longer recognize when they are in a hypoglycemic state. The failure to be able to recognize hypoglycemia can be very dangerous so, if this is an accurate glucose reading, you should consult with your physician very soon and figure out what is causing this condition. Good luck, Mike",

My nurse friend is freakin'!Charm....Do you feel weak and shaky before a meal????? ..................Uhhh, thru most of the last 21 weeks,lol!Bill, I have been in the floor :{ Part of why we stopped the Riba. Ironic thing is...on that lab day I had done shot day before, helped birth NINE pups with my dog till 6:00 AM(Brat HAD to do this ON shot day!), than made coffee and had to drive myself to Shands (40 miles) and back! Not sure HOW I did all that and it is a blur!I don't think it's an error tho as my gluc. has dropped continually on tx, was 53 last labs. I AM living on Breyers, cr*p food right now, so don't undertsand it?? (NOT my norm, diet at all!) Going to get a tester and glucose pill's today!Flguy....., this was the story the doc told me, but keep in mind I was on tx and he thought I was an idiot. ....................LOL! Little did he know!!!!!!!!!!!!!Thanks! It does make sense (to me , an on tx idiot :} and I feel better about stopping the Riba a bit early now.Also now don't feel like such a woosy being\u00a0\u00a0'bedridden' so much!Every move, reduction he has decided to do in my tx, was proven to be the 'right' approach for me...lowering Peg./Riba just talking to me, knowing I wouldn't make it on full does's long, than labs showed Hgb near 'cut off' level for trial, (no rescue drugs) and other changes. Than Fri. he said stop the Riba, try to do the 3 more shots, and labs came back reds low again, glucose really bad, etc.The man is good!Thanks all, time to eat some carbs :}LL",

            "answer": "No, that's not what I was saying. I was saying that ribavirin doesn't severely impact the\u00a0\u00a0blood glucose levels that you'd get with a finger stick testing or when you get fasting glucose levels at the lab. I think finger stick testing when done with an accurate meter are sufficiently accurate and reliable. Hemolytic anemia does, however, impact HbA1c levels so those readings can be, and often are, inaccurately low. People on treatment should not rely on HbA1c levels and especially when, for instance, a diabetic tests and the A1C level looks significantly lower than test results preformed previously when not on treatment. I haven't seen glucose readings from finger sticks or fasting blood glucose tests be affected by treatment so I was saying that I don't believe that your glucose level of 30 is the result of ribavirin, at least insofar as hemolytic anemia is concerned. I am diabetic and I treated for over 3 years and I never saw anything like a glucose reading of 30 from a finger stick test or a lab fasting test but I did see incredibly low HbA1C readings - like 2.3 for instance. It sounds to me as though there is some other reason for your reading of 30 and that hemolytic anemia caused by ribavirin is not the sole answer to your hypoglycemia. I would explore this further Lady Laurie because this isn't normally seen with hemolytic anemia.Mike",

            "answer": "I\u2019m with Mike on this; I think finger-stick or serum glucose as measured by lab should be the real thing. My diabetes educator researched the technical stats on my meter, and while they didn\u2019t list Hgb, they did claim accuracy during hemolysis as measured by hematocrit to 27% (might low).Bottom line; get some glucose tabs at the pharmacy, and try to learn the symptoms of low BG. The tabs are inexpensive and get the sugar up within a few minutes, and come in purse-sized dispensers so they\u2019re convenient. You really want to deal with this sooner rather than later\u2026 even though you may be asymptomatic to hypoglycemia doesn\u2019t mean it isn\u2019t occurring. For me, a blood sugar reading of 30 would be the equivalent of trying to drive with a half-gallon of hooch in my system, assuming I was conscious at all.This can have profound consequences on your systemic health, so it needs to be addressed, like, yesterday!Take care,Bill",

I do recognize BG of around 65 or 60. I have a friend who is type1 and he can't recognize it when he's 20. As you know, this presents a host of dangerous possibilities -\u00a0\u00a0stroke and coma to name just two.Though this isn't really on point, I wonder if you've seen this article:High Incidence of Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus During or Shortly After Treatment With Pegylated Interferon A for Chronic Hepatitis C Virus InfectionPosted 01/28/2008See: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/568466?src=mp\"In conclusion, this is the first prospective study on the development of DM in chronic HCV patients during treatment with Peg-IFN-\u03b1/Riba. We have shown that the incidence of DM, especially type 1, during treatment with Peg-IFN-\u03b1/Riba for chronic HCV infection is markedly higher than reported previously. DM-related complaints are frequently absent or mistaken for Peg-IFN-\u03b1/Riba-related side effects. Routine assessment of random blood glucose is an easy method to identify patients who develop DM during Peg-IFN-\u03b1/Riba treatment. These results support routine assessment of blood glucose levels at all outpatient visits before, during and in the first month after Peg-IFN-\u03b1/Riba treatment to detect DM without delay.\"Mike",

There are two reasons for this: 1) I love the stuff and can never use it unless I am very low and 2) that stuff is richer in sugar that anything else I have found and it seems to be readily bioavailable because it works very quickly.
