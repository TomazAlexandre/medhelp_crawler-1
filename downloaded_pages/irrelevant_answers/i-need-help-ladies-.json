            "answer": "Normal is ...First thing in the morning without food or drink it should be below 90. The rest of the day it should remain between 90-120. That is where they like to keep the numbers. 150 is not extremely high but it is a little high for comfort cuz when your blood sugar gets that high or higher and stays that way it can affect the growth and development of the baby.I have diabetes regardless of pregnancy and with my first two sons my blood sugars stayed in the higher 100s and my first son was 3wks early weighing 9lbs and my second son was also 3wks early weighing at 10lbs 8oz. Having big babies is the more common side affect of high blood sugar but there are other side affects that are very worrisome like the baby not being able to sustain their blood sugar after birth and when their blood sugar drops they have to have sugar water (is what I call it) but in cases like with my first son he wouldnt take the bottle so he was on IV for his first two days.The question is...when was your blood sugar 150? If it is that high first thing in the morning or before you eat or drink anything then the doc will stress to try to keep it lower and may increase or add diabetic meds. If it is 150 bout 15-20 min after eating it is not that high. You just want to make sure that it is 120 or below two hours after you eat.Hope that helps but the doc really needs to give you the run down on where he wants your blood sugars to be. Sometimes a nice swift kick in the butt gets the docs motivated to help instead of assuming that you automatically know the ins and outs of the situation at hand.",
