How does that test the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0How are they seeing how her body digest the sugar without actually taking it.\u00a0\u00a0Why do we have to drink that nasty drink if they could possibly get the results anyway. And why waste money buying it if they can avoid it period.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just wondering. I took mine and would do it again to ensure the health of my baby.",
