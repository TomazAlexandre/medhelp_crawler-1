    "question": "I've had two occasions now (about 4 months apart) where I start to overheat quite badly...both occasions should not have been that hot (one time was after about five minutes of excercise and the other after standing in the sun for about three minutes).After I get hot I start feeling sick and the dizzy. According to the people with me I went extremely white. After a couple of minutes I feel like I really need to sit down (both times I have been standing up). Then My eye sight starts to fade and then my hearing...all I can hear is a very loud ringing.I have ear problems so I'm used to tinitus anyway but its so loud everything else is blurry.I never actually faint and I'm fully aware the whole time. Within a few minutes without doing anything it stops and my eyesight and hearing suddenly come back.My first thought was dehydration or hunger but I fully recover without having eaten or drunk anything.I'm 21 and although not overly fit I don't think this is an issue. I don't smoke or binge drink so my body should be fairly healthy. I have lost about 4 stone over the last year though.I don't really want to see a doctor unless neccessary as I am afraid of losing my driving licence which I don't think is neccessary as I have a few mins between feeling ill and my eyesight blacking out that I could pull over. I don't ever really drive on motorways.My sister suggested seeing my optician or my ENT specialist as it might have something to do with my eyes or ears. I'm not sure what to do.Any advice?",
