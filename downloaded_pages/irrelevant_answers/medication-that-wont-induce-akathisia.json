            "answer": "As a person with advanced tardive dyskinesia in all forms including tardive akathesia I live with that all the time. I do remember having akathesia from antipsychotics. I even had akathesia from Clozaril which is extremely rare. However, now I am on glycine an anti-psychotic in Phase II FDA study that is a glutamate antagonist a new form of antipsychotic that won't cause tardive dyskinesia or diabetes and promotes a full recovery (for more information google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\", the study on me will be published in a standard psychiatric journal and I\"ll make the results available).However, as for anti-depressents, the only one that is known to cause tardive dyskesinia is Trazadone (for more information google \"Patient Education Tardive Dyskinesia) and if you found clinically accurate studies that showed SSRI's causing tardive akathesia even as a statistical rarity, print where I can find them so I can confirm their accuracy with my psychopharmocologist. SSRI's can cause akathesia. That is known. The other two classes I am familiar with tricyclics and MAO inhibitors don't but MAO inhibitors as I am sure you are aware are not used often due to interactions with common food and medications (though I believe they have worked out a patch form that won't have this interaction). But there are newer forms of anti-depressents just being released and I believe they would have less side effects including akathesia. You can look on the site \"Depression Central\" which is a good resource for mood disorders in general and find out more. I believe there are some newer anti-depressents just released that may be more tolerable. Find out about them and ask your psychiatrist and maybe you'll get a better result as regards akathesia.",

    "question": "I don't know how many of you are familiar with Akathisia which is a reaction to certain drugs such as antipsychotics and SSRIs. I had this reaction after taking some medicine for nausea that had an antipsychotic and also when I took metoclopramide.This was by far the worst feeling in earth. You feel like you have been buried alive. When you are still you feel an aweful urge to move and when you move you feel extremely tired. This lasts for about 35 or so hours where you are lucky to get some sleep. SSRIs are known to cause (rarely) tardive akathisia which means it would last even longer.I been feeling depressed and anxious for about 6 months almost every day. I'm scared to take anything that might bring the symptoms I mentioned above. Just wondering if anyone had similar experiences as me...",
