            "answer": "You have seen a physician and should go back to him/her for further discussion and advice. There is a possibility you have a cardiac problem, but I don't want to worry you. You are entitled to a better explanation. Generally a so-called \"water pill\" is prescribed such as furosemide, better known as Lasix, as well as prescribing a salt-free diet.",

            "answer": "When the heart is not functioning properly - general in so-called left heart failure - there is a back-up of fluid. It is called venous pre-load. As part of this syndrome (congestive heart failure) the legs often become swollen. This not to say this is your problem. Furosemide has been around for a long time and has few side effects. Vitamin C is also a diuretic. Try taking 1000 mg of vitamin C a day (crystaline, with food) to reduce the amount of furosemide required. I am pleased you are going back to a physician. Do not hesitate to ask him/her questions.",

            "answer": "If you are not getting any good results from your present doctor, I would certainly see another one and tell him/her what is going on. If they think it is water retention, they should check more to find out why and if the Lasix does not work, there are others that might, such as \"spironolactone\"Losing weight will definitely help, sometimes the diet can act as a form of diuretic.",
