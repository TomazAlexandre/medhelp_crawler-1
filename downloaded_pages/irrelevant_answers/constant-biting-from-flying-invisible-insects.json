            "answer": "Hello,From your symptoms it looks like you are having parasthesia. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol? Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder or a psychiatrist as obsessice compulsive disorder has to be ruled out.I hope it helps. Take care and God bless.",

    "question": "My life is a constant hell as I am either being bitten or have the feeling of insects crawling on me. These insects live on paper and fabric. They are all over my car and all over my house.I have to wash my sheets, towels and clothing every day. I shower 2 or 3 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0I keep all cloth and paper in zip lock bags or plastic tubs. I spray constantly, even in the middle of the night I have to wake and spray the sheets. Not scabies [been tested] and since they fly, I am told they are not mites.Have tried pest control companies [they found nothing], getting tested for scabies [nothing], changing my diet, poisns, essential oils . . .\u00a0\u00a0the list is huge in what I have tried. DEET mixed with alcohol seems to work best on my clothes and poison from Home Depot, sprayed daily in every room [ceiling to floor], works temporarily. Diatomaceous earth does nothing.I have lost almost EVERYTHING in my life, this is HELL.Who can help me? I do not know where to go\u00a0\u00a0. . . I tried the CDC but they were useless, doctors have not helped so far.",
