            "answer": "No, there is nothing normal about it. Non-diabetics rarely go over 120 no matter what they eat or drink. You are showing symptoms of diabetes. You should get an A1C done which is an average of blood sugars for a period of 2-3 months. Unfortunately hypoglycemia does turn into diabetes for many people. As you are thin, and have lost weight you should be sure if you are diagnosed with diabetes that they correct assess you for Type 1 or Type 2. If you have a doctor who tells you this is normal and not to worry, see another doctor. Diabetes is a manageable condition which if ignored can have grave consequences. Do get checked soon and let us know how it goes.",

            "answer": "You shouldn't be scared to do the OGTT, because a single high will not harm you, it is the regular highs that you have if you go undiagnosed that can cause the problem. However, the OGTT gives more information, but is not the typical test to diagnose. At this point that is the A1C which is a simple blood test for which you don't even have to fast. In terms of results 5.7 to 6.4 is considered prediabetic and 6.5 and over diabetic. In terms of a fasting blood sugar which some doctors use to diagnose, 100 to 125 is prediabetic and 126 and over is diabetic.",

            "answer": "Two more thoughts. A lot of people don't take hypoglycemia seriously as I'm sure you have noticed over the years. I have to admit I was one of those people who thought people were just complaining. Then I was in Costa Rica with a friend and her husband. We had a hard time finding a place we wanted to have lunch and then the service was very slow so we were starving. I am a Type 1 diabetic, my friend's husband is a Type 2 diabetic and my friend also said she was hypoglycemic. Richard and I were a tad irritable, but Tami was visibly shaking and drenched in sweat!Second, you mentioned you are taking steriods, but I wasn't sure if you were still on them. Steroids are known to drive blood sugar up.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed 2o years with hypoglycemia with sugar passing in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0since that time my urine has never been rechecked during a glucose tolerance test and i have been controlling my hypoglycemia with dietary changes.\u00a0\u00a0a few years ago i started not feeling well after eating and no concern was shown for this.\u00a0\u00a0recently i have been perscribed steroids for a different issue and am essentially unable to eat.\u00a0\u00a0i become tired, ill feeling, weak, sometimes disoriented, and fall asleep often after eating, etc . I have lost 20pounds.\u00a0\u00a0i have never been able to gain weight and have always been considered underweight-this is very distressing because generally this will take me a year to gain back.\u00a0\u00a0The only exception to this was pregnancy where i gained more than half my body weight without trying and immediately lost the weight post partum.\u00a0\u00a0i did some home tests with my monitor and found that my sugar levels peak in 15 to 20 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0after 30 grams of sugar in a sport drink i checked my sugar every 5 minutes and found a peak of 230 at 20 minutes dropping to 159 an hour from drinking.\u00a0\u00a0i have rechecked this a couple times and it follows the same pattern.\u00a0\u00a0less sugar equals smaller peak and returning to my normal of 70 within the hour-more sugar with a higher peak and returning to normal more slowly.\u00a0\u00a0I have been told this is normal and am not convinced-because i dont feel good. any suggestions would be greatly appreciated,",
