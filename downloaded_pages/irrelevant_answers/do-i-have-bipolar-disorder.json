            "answer": "Yes some of what you are describing sounds like bipolar but only a psychiatrist could provide a diagnosis.If your parents are not approachable about this issue you could speak with a guidance counselor who could refer you to to a therapist. As well you could speak to the doctor who treats you for the diabetes and see if they would know of a therapist as well.",

            "answer": "I agree you should tell someone. It is important for doctors to know all of your symptoms so they can treat them properly. Yes if you cannot speak then write it down. I know it can make some people nervious to talk about certain things, but you can neither diagnose or treat yourself and since you are so young you can only get help by telling some adult so they can help you. Good luck to you and take care dear.",

    "question": "This is my first post here... and I feel like I'm going crazy. I just turned 14 last month. Last year, I was searching online about Bipolar, cause I knew there was something wrong with me. When I looked at the symptoms, they sounded exactly like me, all of the symptoms for both mania and depression. I took the quizzes online to see if I have Bipolar (I know that they aren't always that reliable) and all of them said yes. Now when I look back to when I was around 11 years old, I do see a lot of the signs for mania. I already knew I was depressed in one way or the other. Or maybe the mania symptoms back then came from my low blood sugars, since I am a Type 1 Diabetic. Once, when I was trying to fall asleep, I had a hallucination of these two voices arguing. There was a static sound the entire time which kept growing louder and then it stopped all of a sudden. My parents don't exactly know anything about this, since I never told them anything. They probably just think that I'm very,very moody. The rest of my family seems to think that too. Some days, like this week, I can go from being extremely happy and productive to laying in bed and crying for no reason at all. Any opinions on if I have Bipolar or not? And I just read that Bipolar gets worse over time, and it really seems like that for me. I really want to tell someone. And I can't exactly tell my parents, we're not that close and I don't know how to tell them anyway. Any thoughts, please?",
