            "answer": "You have been through a lot.\u00a0\u00a0If it were just anxiety, then I would think you would get relief from a drug in the same class as Valium.\u00a0\u00a0If the anxiety is causing severe constipation, then MiraLax could get your digestion back on track.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me, constipation can make one very sick, and once you are used to being that way, it is very hard to detect what's going on.For my anxiety I found relaxation therapy with biofeedback very helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Also a low dose of nortriptyline or amitriptyline might help even you out, but they are constipating.\u00a0\u00a0Have they tested you for STDs and PID?\u00a0\u00a0What about your gallbladder function?\u00a0\u00a0(HIDA scan).",

            "answer": "Have they done an ultrasound, you mentioned bleeding a lot? I had a fibroid tumor for 15 years and didn't know it but we found it when I was 25 and was bleeding to death because it severed an artery into. A lot of people don't think of things like this but it will cause nausea, vomiting, ab pain, and lots of other items. I was suprised what a difference it made once it was gone but then realized I had other gastric problems when the fibroid was removed. Just a thought.",

    "question": "Hi, I am new and not sure if this question belongs here.I have been suffering from back pain, fully body aches, severe stomach pain (I literally can't move) groin pain, constant nausea, vomiting nearly everything I eat and sometimes blood, migraines, dizziness, weakness, fainting, I have had my periods stopped due to heavy bleeding over two years ago but now I am bleeding again its been going for over three weeks and it hurts bad. I am tired because I can't sleep due to pain, nausea and nightmares.btw I am twenty if that helps at all.This has been going on for over ten years since the abuse with the cult started, I have recently left about nine months ago and I am finally safe. I have been seeing doctors, therapists and gone to hospitals for over two years trying to get answers, but all I get is \"it's in your head\" or \"take some buscopan and panadol\".I am terrified of doctors and most people, I have run out of ideas of what to try next, I just want to give up. Please if you have any ideas on how to fix any of the problems above or anywhere that might help it would be greatly appreciated.I hope your all having a good day. Thanks",
