            "answer": "Well, not for nothing...Ultrasounds are not 100% when it comes to weight. I didn't have an ultrasound at all for my first but she weighed 10lbs 2 1/2 oz. My second child was 2 wks late and the ultrasound said he was only 8lbs 8oz and he weighed 11 lbs when he was born. My third child they said I had to have early to avoid that size again. At 37 wks, they did an ultrasound and it said he was already 10 lbs so they induced me that night. The next night he was born and only weighed 8lbs even. I wouldn't worry too much over it. I didn't have gestational diabetes either, I just have large babies. Try to hang in there. I know it's hard but it really is too early to induce. The only problem I see is that they could end up doing a c-section because in 3 1/2 wks, your baby could gain anywhere between 3 and 6 lbs. The last month of pregnancy they gain 1 - 2 lbs a week. Best of luck to you.",

            "answer": "8 lbs, 9 oz is certainly big for 34 weeks, but momof8215 is right, ultrasounds can be so off when it comes to predicting weight.\u00a0\u00a0I know that you are miserable and are desperate to get some relief as well as are worried about your baby's health, but trust me, the best and safest place for you baby is right where she is.\u00a0\u00a0Given your diabetes, I am certain that your doctors are carefully monitoring your baby's size and health.\u00a0\u00a0At 34 weeks, the baby's lungs have not finished developing and she may have breathing problems at birth.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the digestive system is not completed nor is her ability to regulate her body temp.\u00a0\u00a0As miserable as you are (and trust me I understand - I am 38 weeks with a potential 10 pounder and have to use a cane to walk), it may be worth a few more weeks of misery to ensure months and years of better health for your daughter.Try not to worry too much about her being breech, she still has time to turn, and if she does not then the worst case is a c-section, which they may want to do anyway if her size gets too big.\u00a0\u00a0I know that with GD, the doctors do a fine dance between not taking babies too early and not letting them get too big.\u00a0\u00a0So hopefully you have a good doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure that everything will work out okay and I wish you all the strength to make it through the next 3-6 weeks.",

            "answer": "I agree with the others. I really don't trust ultrasounds as far as estimating size. I've seen women freak out about having large babies who end up giving birth to little tiny 6 lb. babies. I think the size of your previous children is a much better indicator. How big were they and were you diabetic with them? It really is too early to induce labor. Your baby could end up having to stay in the NICU. Plus, if baby does remain breech, you'll be given a c-section and won't have to worry about pushing out a big baby. Also, from what I've read - babies gain an average of 8 oz. a week toward the end so you're looking at a baby right around 10 lbs. if the u/s is correct. I've had 2 ten pounders, it's not so bad.",

            "answer": "U/s can definitely be off. My sister wastold she was having a big baby and he was only 6lbs. I was told I was having a big baby and he was! 9lbs 5 oz. The last couple weeks are hard. I felt beyond huge, bloated. My feet were the size of basketballs. I couldn't even lay down from the reflux I had. Hang in there. All the uncomfortableness is worth it inthe end.",

Babies born this early certainly survive just fine, but can and often do face some extra challenges as newborns.\u00a0\u00a0There is no better incubator then your womb. Either way, they won't risk you or the baby, so trust in your Dr.'s.\u00a0\u00a0I have no doubt all is going to be just fine.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you!",
