            "answer": "Lots of discussion regarding diabetes and infertility in men. Most say diabetes \"may\" or \"can cause\" infertility, including \"they suggest\" but no mention of who \"they\" is. A few mention \"studies show\" but again no name of study to research the so-called study. Bottom line, nothing is conclusive. Your partner needs to see a fertility specialist, usually a Urologist, who will perform a physical examination to determine if there are any true cause/s.
