            "answer": "First visit they will see your sugar readings seeing where your at if your where they want you(Fasting under 90After meals 120 for me its an hr after meals for others its 2 hrs after meals at 120 it depends on the Dr)They will then do basic weigh and bpU will talk to a nurse they will ask u questions due date & pregnancy.Then ultrasound.Make sure baby's development is going good because with high sugars development of baby can be compromised. Especially his heart & organs. Not at first visit but eventually they will schedule appointment with a cardiologist and they will see if everything is good.Uhm what else oh and every visit they will give u sonograms and tell you weight of the baby if he is on target.Its about it nothing bad.If your sugars are controlled then a piece of cake.Good luck (:I have GD and see them monthly",

            "answer": "I'm a type one diabetic and am pregnant with my sixth. My advice, don't be afraid. I had a baby with a birth defect when my diabetes was in the best control of my life. All my other babies have been healthy, with less than ideal control. They will try to scare you, but don't listen. Yes, control your blood sugars as best you can, but don't feel guilty if it isn't perfect.At the point you are at, it's going to come down to baby's size. I've had big babies because doctors fought over my diabetes control (four children 10, 11, and 12 pounds, and my first was 8). They will estimate his or her size and may advise induction or a c-section if baby is \"too big\". It's up to you how you deliver. You can always try a vaginal delivery even with a big baby. I wish I hadn't just gone with my doctors. Educate yourself on everything. And not just what the doctors tell you. I'm now fighting for a VBA4C because I didn't educate myself.You can do it. Just enjoy the last part of your pregnancy as best you can and get ready to be a mama. It's amazing!",

            "answer": "Katkells you had a baby born with birth defect when they were good sugars? Wow if you don't mind me asking what was the defect? I'm paranoid because I don't get perfect readings. My ob looked at them and he said they were good and they could be worse. My highest was 180 I think after the hr. Hate it but trying my Best to control it. I'm 30 wks tomorrow",
