            "answer": "Hi. Anxiety can cause itching.\u00a0\u00a0Have you changed soaps, laundry detergent, lotions, cologne....anything lately?\u00a0\u00a0That is normally the cause of itching.\u00a0\u00a0Think back to anything new you switched to, but I really feel you need to see a Dermatologist.Similasan is for pink eye, I don't see how this would benefit you.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know where you live but check to see if there are any clinics in your area that can help you at little to no cost. For now try some Cortizone 10 cream to help with the itching.\u00a0\u00a0If it is anxiety you need to see someone to help with that.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could be of more help.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes.",
