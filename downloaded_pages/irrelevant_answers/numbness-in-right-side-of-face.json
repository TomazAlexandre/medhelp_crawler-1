            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. He hasn't been to a neurologist yet. That is definetly the next step. He has been to 3 drs. 1 said nothing can be done. The other said to wait and see if it goes away and the last one gave him some meds and see how that goes and if not he goes to neurologist. He got hit 2 years ago so he has been to dr. right after and they said wait and see so... WE are going to go ahead and make an appt. for neurologist. Thanks again.",
