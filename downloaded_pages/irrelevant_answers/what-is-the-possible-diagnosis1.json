            "answer": "my husband complains that I go to the doctor for \"every little thing\"That is because I don't want them to become big things.I ignored the \"flu from hell\", an atypical severe illness with neurological aspects.One year later, I had \"lancinating\" pains, that would literally make my eyes leak tears and buckle my knees. I didn't seek medical attention until I had several other pyhsycal symptoms and could hardly walk.I live in an area where \"tick borne infections\" don't happen to people, only dogs.....yeah right......I got treated for lyme disease and got better ...slowly because it took 2 years from infection to start of treatment. Not everything is lyme disease.Go to the doctor. How do you know you don't have diabetes? You may have disc problemin your back. It could be peripheral circulation issues....Geez, it cound be a zillion things from horrible to easily cured or treated.Go to the doctor even if you have toaccess a public health care system, just go.stress of not\u00a0\u00a0knowing will make it worse.\u00a0\u00a0if it is neuropathy they will give you medications that can relieve your suffering pretty much completely.GO for it.! Feel better.",

    "question": "I am 34 yeas old male. I am having numbness and tingling in my both feet and calves for the last three years. Its intensity increased over the time. I have burning sensation on the planter surface of my feet. Somtimes I have feeling of heaviness in both legs. On the latereal surface of my left foot and left heel I have pain for the same duration of time which stays most of the day. I have also pain in both knees which is getting intense and worse over the period of time.I started taking aleeve four month ago. Its helps me a little bit for the pain but not much. I also do planter stretching and leg strecthing to relieve the pain in my calves and knees. It is helpful sometimes. I am worried about tingling and numbness and burning sensations.I don't have diabetes or other major co-morbids. And I don't take anyother medications. I don't have family history of such problems.I have been in a state of denial so far and tried telling me I shold be OK but I think I am reaching to th point\u00a0\u00a0to realize that I should seek medical advice soon.based on my symptoms and complains, any suggestions about the possbile diagnosis.thanks,michael holding",
