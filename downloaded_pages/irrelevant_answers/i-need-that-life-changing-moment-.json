Its just...easier to sit on my butt at the house, I suppose.\u00a0\u00a0 But I do it.Come on!\u00a0\u00a0Make that decision.\u00a0\u00a0I lost 45 pounds or so, and you can, too.\u00a0\u00a0I eat normal, everyday foods.\u00a0\u00a0I can go out to eat.\u00a0\u00a0You can learn what to eat, and much more importantly, WHY you should eat.Thanks for joining this community.\u00a0\u00a0Post your feelings often, get to know us.\u00a0\u00a0We're on this journey forever, so welcome aboard!Peek",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for sharing your enthusiasm.\u00a0\u00a0I am in the process of trying to find out why I have some neurlogical symptoms (info in my journal) but there is no reason why I can't do some exercise everyday.\u00a0\u00a0I think my eating is pretty good, just too much and for the wrong reasons.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than Weight Watchers'\u00a0\u00a0I think I actually need to research more about avoiding Diabetes since my blood sugar runs too high....What you said about doing it for yourself...that's huge.\u00a0\u00a0I am single, but I do cook for people and am way too concerned about what they might want.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to process this...I will write tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to the Jersey Shore for a vacation in about 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0That's another good reason to start now!Thanks again,Mary Kay",

            "answer": "Let me just say that my husband lost about 60-65 pounds, and no longer has type2 diabetes, nor does he have to take his BP meds any longer.Weight plays such a major role in our bodies and how we feel.\u00a0\u00a0 Really think about this whole issue, and give things an honest try.I'm so enthusiastic about WW b/c its an extremely healthy diet, easy to follow, plenty of support and encouragement even if you do it online, and no weird foods or medicines to take.Its the only thing that I've ever been able to stick to for a long period of time.Whatever you do, think about your reasons, and start on your getting healthy plan, for you.(stop by the Healthy Cooking Forum for great tasting, healthy recipes!)",
