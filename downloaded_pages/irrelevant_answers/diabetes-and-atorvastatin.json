    "question": "I started taking atorvastatin approx 4 years ago. Two years ago i developed extreme pain in my big toe and then over 2-3 months migrated to Knee, elbow, hand. One side only at a time. Extreme pain starting late afternoon/evening and subsiding 3-4am. Gout was initial thought but ruled out by several tests of the fluid drawn from multiple joints. It just went away and i am talking Sulfasalazine daily. Now two years later i am told out of the blue i am type 2 diabetic. Never in my family history. Also thyroid gland not producing enough.\u00a0\u00a0Then i was asked about Atorvastatin and these issues especially typ 2 diabetes. Its all over the internet but my doctors don't seem to know much about the possible connection. What can i be told about this and further how does one investigate and gain knowledge to make a good decision. I am still taking it and don't know what to do. I am following drs orders at this time.",
