            "answer": "Hello,The data is quite supportive of taking a low dose daily aspirin if you are over the age of 40 year and have diabetes, in order to help prevent heart attack and stroke. The aspirin may not seem as though it is doing anything obvious, but it is likely doing great preventive things on your behalf.The Atorvastatin is something you should discuss further with your doctor. But do know that your lipid numbers may be at goal BECAUSE of the atorvastatin, so stopping it may make the level worse than they are now. In addition there is also good supportive data about this class of medications in terms of preventing heart disease in people with diabetes, so overall it is a good idea to have it on your medication regimen, unless there are reasons why you should not be taking it. So discuss further with your doctor if you are concerned.Take care.",

            "answer": "one does get a few prescription drugs that combine a statin and aspirin.however, aspirin therapy should be started after consulting your endocrinologist / diabetologist, since \"daily aspirin therapy\", once started, cannot be stopped immediately (it has to be done gradually) - so one has to be careful about that.but one cant deny the positive effects of aspirin for diabetics even if their lipids and BG are in control.so a quick chat with your MD will help you out.",
