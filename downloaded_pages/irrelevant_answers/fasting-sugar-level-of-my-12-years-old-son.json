            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I can understand your concern for your son, because there is a family history of diabetes/prediabetes. His blood sugar seems to be within the normal limits. The fasting sugar of 109 is on the higher end of that, but less than 110 is not considered elevated. The 116 after eating is well within normal limits. Rather than continuing to test your son's blood sugar at home (something a 12 year old boy is going to tire of quickly) I would recommend mentioning your concerns to the pediatrician. This might give you the reassurance you need and give your pediatrician a heads up to monitor your son in the coming years. Additionally, because diet and exercise have helped you, it might be good to make it a family affair. Good nutrition and exercise habits that are started young can be helpful later in life.Cathy",

    "question": "I am 39 pre diabetic for last 6 years and high cholesterol and controlling it by weight and exercise and its working , while i was checking the blood sugar of mine yesterday , my child came to me and I yesterday checked sugar level of my son who is 12 years at 11 am. It came 109, he was playing at that time and waked up 2 hours before but it was fasting of 9+ hours. I got worried so i checked him again 2 hours after his heavy break fast, it came 116, then i checked him again in the evening randomly( 10 minutes after he taken bread slices), it came back again 116.So i am really worried, please help me to advise should i be worried for fasting. He don't have any symptoms neither frequent urination nor thirst. He also did not complain for other symptoms and over all he is energetic child. Please help me to advise should i check more and its normal.Thank you.",
