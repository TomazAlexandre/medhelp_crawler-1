            "answer": "Hello,White spots on cheeks in children may be found in pityriasis alba or vitiligo.Pityriasis alba is a common hypopigmented dermatitis that occurs primarily in preadolescent children. This is a self-limited disorder that usually resolves by adulthood.Severe cases may benefit by Psoralen plus ultraviolet light A photochemotherapy (PUVA).Vitiligo also causes pale, white patches to develop on the skin. This is because that particular area of skin has little or none of a type of pigment called melanin.It is also found mainly on sun exposed areas.In my opinion,a consultation of a dermatologist will be the best as treatment modalities for both are different.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor to find out the cause in your son's case and plan the further management accordingly.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.Fungal infections of the human body are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.",
