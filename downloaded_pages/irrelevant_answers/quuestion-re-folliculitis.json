            "answer": "Hi.The folliculitis may be secondary to the infection. This appears to be a bacterial upper respiratory tract infection and folliculitis is a bacterial infection. It is possible that these may be associated. As for the skin condition to be secondary to the medications, this should be an allergic skin reaction and not folliculitis.Continue with your medication and observe if this continues. An allergic skin reaction usually manifests with itchiness and large patches of skin papules.I know you are worried about this. The folliculitis should be readily treated with topical antimicrobials.How old are you?Do you have a strong family history of diabetes?",
