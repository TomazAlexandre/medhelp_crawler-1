            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I read through your post very carefully and based on that I feel that you are possibly suffering from Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome. All these result in tender abdomen, loose stool or loose stools alternating with constipation, abdominal distention, cramps etc. Please refer http***en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coeliac_disease http***en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ulcerative_colitisShortness of breath and fast heart rate could be due to anemia. Joint and muscle pains can be due to vitamin deficiencies. I would strongly recommend you to see a gastroenterologist (a specialist who looks after the diseases of our digestive system). Maybe your physician can recommend someone.It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please discuss this with your doctor (preferably a gastroenterologist) and get yourself investigated accordingly. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
