    "question": "To Dr Edward/Hunter,I am returning to this forum after around 3 and half months. On august 3 i posted a question to you about 2-5 \"seconds\" oral risk with and unknown\u00a0\u00a0HIV status women (she performed) and Dr Edward was very kind enough to allay all my fears and said no need for testing. I did not test.Couple days ago i had a UTI, went to the urgent care.Doc there did a urine routine and said i had UTI. I am a physical therapist and hence started myself on some medications which the doc said continue and added bactrium DS as an antibiotic.had fever 100 and aches with burning urine sensation.I have known to be underweight. However last 6 months i have not put on weight and infact have lost some. i have IBS (had post infective colitis in 03)Long story short.Could this (UTI) be a late symptom of acute hiv? Its been 100 days since the possible exposure.Do i need to be doing HIV testing now or no? I will be getting Diabetes screening done since it runs in my dad's family. I am concerned since i am married.On a side note, i am well informed on the HIV topic since i have read a lot on it in med literature and your forum.Will be glad to hear from you sir!Thanks",
