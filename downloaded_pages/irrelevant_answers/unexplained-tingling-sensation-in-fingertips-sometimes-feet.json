    "question": "Hi doctors and members, I am a healthy 19 year old and i am very active in sports. I recently started getting these really weird tingling sensations that last for like about 5 seconds and then just go away in my fingertips and sometimes/rarely feet. I'm going to take my sugar(glucose) diabetes test tomorrow using a home blood test machine from my grandparents. I'm kinda anxious about what it is because it just comes up out of nowhere. I'll either be sitting down watching TV or somtimes im using my cell phone or sometimes ill be on the computer typing and it starts to tingling like if it wants to go numb but it doesnt. It simply just tingles. This recently started like 3 weeks ago. Any answers would be great! Thank you for your time.-Andy",
