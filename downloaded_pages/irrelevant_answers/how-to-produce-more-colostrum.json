            "answer": "You need to trick your body into thinking baby is here already. The more often you do it the more you will produce. If you want to speed up the process you need to be expressing regularly, every 2-4 hours. If you do each breast twice each time it will make you produce more too. Basically the more effort you put in the more you will get out. It works on a supply and demand basis, so the more your body thinks the baby needs the more it will produce",
