            "answer": "i looked it up and this is what i found:It is not suggested to take bitter gourd for the first time during pregnancy, if you haven\u2019t successfully used it well before pregnancy. Abdominal cramping and other gastric consequences can be caused by bitter gourd. When people introduce bitter gourd into their diet, they experience severe gas, bloating or diarrhea. You should be aware that consuming bitter may lower your blood glucose to an unhealthy degree if you don\u2019t have diabetes or gestational diabetes.The seeds have vicine so it can trigger symptoms of favism in susceptible individuals. Also, the red arils of the seeds are reported to be toxic to children and end pregnancies. The fruit has been recognized to stimulate activity in the uterus and could lead to pre-term labor. Breast-feeding women should also refrain from taking bitter melon, as the chemicals in the fruit can be transferred through breast milk. Effects of the bitter melon on children can be harmful. So bitter gourd in any form should be avoided to the pregnant women. so it seems like if you were going to have any bad side effects you would have already had them but why risk it again?\u00a0\u00a0i would avoid anything that says it can end your pregnancy next time you might not be as lucky and now that your so far along you want to avoid anything that can cause labor 34 weeks is still way to early",
