            "answer": "Yes, weight gain is common and changes to body shape (even without weight gain) due to the loss of pelvic integrity from severed ligaments is a given. And unfortunately, no drug or supplement can adequately replace what was taken from the body. Granted, there may be some things that help but there is no true replacement. That is why it is such a travesty that hysterectomy and oophorectomy are grossly overused and women are not told the medically documented aftereffects.",

            "answer": "most weight gain after a hysterectomy is due to the lack of activity during the healing process!! My advice is to not just lay there. Get up and go do as much as possible without over doing it as soon as possible! Also watch what u eat while not being as active as usual. We know what puts on the lbs and what doesnt! While your laying in bed excersise your legs or mayb get some light weights to work your arms out! If your body is moving your burning calories!! I did not gain any weight after my TVH nor has anyone i know gained weight! It can be very easy to blame the weight gain on the hysterectomy but hysterectomies do not cause weight gain by themselves and thats a very true fact! If u have heard that they do well thats just a myth!! Look it up and do your research! Dont let the fear of gaining weight stop you from having a surgery that could change your way of life tremendously or it could even save your life!! Most women are very happy they had their hysterectomies. Usually the women who have had other complications are the ones that post and search for answers while the ones with good experiences dont post so thats why u see alot of negatives about hysterectomies online! My favorite site that got me thru my TVH was hystersisters! Any question u have u will find your answer there but again most people post about their probs and not good experiences, even there!! I am 7 weeks postop from my TVH and i havent had any probs! Didnt even need pain meds when i got home from my 1 night stay at hospital! Just took ibupropen for a couple days for mild cramping! I had some constipation after surgery but that is almost a given after surgery and they give u pain meds at hospital and they cause constipation. I had it b4 surgery so i knew i wld get it but by taking colace stool softners and miralax once per day i was all back to normal in a few weeks! They usuatly start u on colace b4 u leave hospital and suggest u take them for several weeks after so your stool will stay soft cuz u cant be doing any straining during the healing process!!\u00a0\u00a0Also someone posted that the shape of your body will change after a hysterectomy. I dont know anyone that has happened too! If u are having hysterectomy due to an enlarged uterous or large fibroids like i did them your tummy will b flatter after surgery and thats a good thing! Other than that no body changes to report otherwise on myself or the others that i know who have had hysterectomies!! Good luck and happy healing!!",

            "answer": "Hi Ladies, Thank you for taking the time to write your responses to me -I very much appreciate them. I am still reeling from the whirlwind that picked me up and dumped me in this new place of life post-op from\u00a0\u00a0 hysterectomy and BSO.My doctor wouldn't agree to my having a follow-up scan 18 months after my first 'event' and hysteroscopy/biopsies,even though I had the endometrium growing into the myometrium back then. So I organised my own\u00a0\u00a0scan and Specialist appt. 5 days later I had my second hysteroscopy/biopsies. The path report said \"highly suspicious,if not worse\". 2 weeks later I had the big op. That was 3 weeks ago.Happily, the path report from the second op didn't report malignancy.\u00a0\u00a0So there hasn't been much time to learn about the whole deal. I get out of breath quickly, and when I tire my hands and feet become cold as ice. I think my body is reacting as if stressed constantly, and pulling all available blood supply/oxygen to my core to heal me. Or maybe its just my diabetes! Best wishes for health!",

            "answer": "I am glad to hear that you did not have cancer but sorry that you lost your organs anyway. Unfortunately, that happens too often. My situation was similar in that my gynecologist rushed me into surgery so I did not have time to research and cancel.Major surgery is a trauma to the body and ovary removal or post-hysterectomy ovarian failure (which happens in about 40% of cases) is a severe trauma to the body. The ovaries of intact women produce hormones into their 80's for good health (physical, mental, emotional, sexual).I am much further out from surgery than the other poster (8 years versus 7 weeks). In hindsight, I wish I had done things very differently (not only PRIOR TO surgery but AFTER also). For one, I wish I had understood more about hormone \"replacement\" and would have realized that my gynecologist (surgeon) did not \"give a darn\" about me after surgery. It may have saved me from being in an almost non-functional state for well over a year post-op.Did you discuss HRT with your doctor? The loss of ovarian hormones may also affect your diabetes. And many women report thyroid problems after hysterectomy and/or ovary removal so that would be something else to watch for.I have always been thin and have only gained about 2 lbs. since my hysterectomy but I eat WAY less because I lost my appetite (which is a good thing as I do not want to gain). I lost my taste buds for many foods (except sweets).",

            "answer": "Hi. Thanks for responding again. I'm grateful that you have researched and come to some understanding of post-op issues like hormone imbalance. I hope you have been able to find balance after what was clearly a traumatic time post op. I needed to have the surgery, because even though no invasive cancer was found on the bits they tested, the previous op had removed cells that were described as having \"increased mitotic activity\". So it was just a matter of time before one of these found a place to attach and continue growing. I believe we share the concern for our hormonal balance.It is pretty awful that in this day and age so little information is readily available. I was aware of the relationship between hormones 5 years ago, when I was found to have diabetes, wasn't ovulating, and had metabolic syndrome. My then dr was no help , and I have struggled and fought for access to information. I am on oestrogen patches, and have read that testosterone should also be considered. Let's keep talking!",

            "answer": "It would certainly make sense that we would need testosterone since post-menopausal ovaries produce much more androgens (testosterone and androstenedione) than estrogen. These androgens actually reach pre-menopausal levels in intact women in their 70's. These androgens are\u00a0\u00a0then converted into estrogen, as needed by the body. It would be great if exogenous testosterone worked the same way but I do not think it works quite like our innate body / endocrine system. And unfortunately, there is no FDA approved testosterone \"medication\" in the U.S. for women. I have used testosterone and did not notice any benefits but may not have used it long enough. I have considered taking DHEA which can be purchased over-the-counter.",

            "answer": "Interesting that there is no FDA approved testosterone. Thank you for that intel -I will proceed with caution when discussing replacement therapy. Half the testosterone is made elsewhere ? adrenals. I wonder if diet can influence the production.Firstly a blood test would show what levels are holding.The other hormone you mention -andro... is new to me, so I'll google it. Can't wait to have the energy to wade past all the sites that only acknowledge oestrogen and testosterone and get the whole picture! Thank you my friend",

    "question": "Hi. I read some ladies are gaining weight post hysterectomy, one told it is due to insufficient levels of 'L????' . The lady then says there is no replacement for 'L????' currently so it doesn't matter what the name is. I think she is referring to Leptin, and the reading I've done indicates there is a replacement. Is there? If not, a newly released diet programme that maximises leptin use is available, and called the Venus factor. I've just had hysterectomy plus bilat BSO for dodgy histology, and am not linked to the Venus factor diet.Regards,",
