            "answer": "Is it the one hour test? I took e Monday unexpectedly but I ate that morning. I guess everywhere is different bc some require you to fast and others say you can eat. Anyway it's not that bad. You have to drink this drink they give you in front of them, then wait an hour, then they will draw blood and that's it. The drink made me feel sick and gave me an instant sugar high and headache. Everyone takes it differently but it made me a little sick. You will be fine though, it wears off after while",
