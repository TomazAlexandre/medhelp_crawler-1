            "answer": "Hello, I've learned a lot in the past 8 months (since I've found that I am a type 1 Diabetic) and I suggest to you to look for a Diabetes Educator. When I first left my Doctor's office after my first visit I was completely lost, I was not sure how to use insulin, how to calculate ratios, I've read a ton and still lost. One thing I found... my ratios for the short acting insulin (novolog) were different for every time of the day and meals... and my diabetes educator ad I had to try a lot of ratios before we found a set of ratios that worked for me...\u00a0\u00a0Also I am not sure why you were told to take your thos 1 hour before meals... in general if your BG is not low you should take your shot 15 minutes before meals but I am not a doctor, but someone that has Diabetes... please if you can, ask your doctor to refer you to a Diabetes Educator... you will be more confident about your BG control . I wish you all the best.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply, everything has been working for years and then all of a sudden it went hay wire. My DE advised me to change the time of the shot to 1 hour apparatly my system does not use the Novalog that fast so we are trying to adjust the time before meals. Since I wrote the question IF I take the shot 45 mins. before a meal it works great in fact I am back to normal ranges again. I called my Endo and will see him nnext week for evaluation will let you guys know the outcome.Thank you for your concern, Rich",
