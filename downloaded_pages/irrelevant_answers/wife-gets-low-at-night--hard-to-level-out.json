            "answer": "First of all, I want to compliment you on being such a supportive and knowledgable husband.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your new endocrinologist is on top of current best practices for treament of diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0The switch you wife is making is what many Type I's are on and it seems to be the best way to manage diabetes with injections. The new longer acting insulins are much better since they do not have a peak and hopefully won't have the same impact on your wife's middle of the night blood sugars.She may find that she can control those highs and lows a lot better with this new insulin routine, as long as she continues checking her blood sugars and paying attention to her own unique patterns. One of the problems with diabetes is that it looks different on every person and there is no absolute answer to why it takes so long for your wife' blood sugars to come back up when she is low.It is not normal for jice to take 2 hours to raise your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It does take at least 15 minutes for juice or coke to work and when you are feeling low, and it is sometimes hard to wait that long to feel better.\u00a0\u00a0The tendency is to keep drinking\u00a0\u00a0and then end up with a high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0In her case, her insulin may have peaked and she just had too much insulin in her system.Anyway, best of luck on this new routine.\u00a0\u00a0I think you will find it much easier to manage.Es",

            "answer": "Lows in the early hours of the morning are quite common when NPH (of which Humalin N is a brand)is injected before bed. It happens because NPH peaks 6-10 hours after being injected. It doesn't always happen because there is up to 30% variation in absorption and the level of action with NPH.Your wife is probably being put on Lantus or Levemir basal insulin, both of which are peakless. And the intraday variability is much lower. So things will improve. The hardest part is figuring out what the correct dose is. But once she gets that sorted, her control should get easier and better.Cheers,Mark",

            "answer": "Luckily my wife takes care of hers very good and she can normally feel when it's off.\u00a0\u00a0The scariest thing I've seen was actually just a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0She was needing to get up and take a shower.\u00a0\u00a0But she sat there a minute, told me \"after you shower (I had already showered) you either need to ***** your finger or check your blood sugar.\" and then she just layed down against me.\u00a0\u00a0Which didn't make any sense to start with I was like, \"honey I don't do that you do. are you low?\"\u00a0\u00a0I made her drink something and kept quizzing her to try to force her to think.\u00a0\u00a0It was scary.\u00a0\u00a0Usually at worst I've seen is her mix up words and get frustrated until she was normal again.\u00a0\u00a0But this time she didn't even know.\u00a0\u00a0It's a very helpless feeling because I couldn't do much except keep her going until the sugar to hit her.\u00a0\u00a0I'll be glad for her to get a better regiment.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the information guys.",

    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I have been married to a type 1 diabetic for 5 years now.\u00a0\u00a0My wife is extremely smart, so I've always listened and helped her according to her needs.\u00a0\u00a0She's 26 now and I am 33.\u00a0\u00a0Up to now, she's taken huminalin N (1 a day) and R (twice a day).\u00a0\u00a0Her childhood endo and then one we had been taking her to kept that norm.\u00a0\u00a0Then we moved back to her home area of Dallas and had to find another one.\u00a0\u00a0This doctor said that her regiment was a hold over from her being a kid and should have been changed before now.\u00a0\u00a0She's changing it to be one long term shot and then a different shot anytime she eats carbs (and she will have to calculate how much to take).\u00a0\u00a0From my understanding, it won't be R and N any longer.\u00a0\u00a0That will be happening within a month, because they have to retrain my wife first on how to do it.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway that's backstory.\u00a0\u00a0My wife sometimes gets into spells of getting low at night (it wakes her up).\u00a0\u00a0She'll drink a glass of juice or something, wait 20 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is, it doesn't always work that fast.\u00a0\u00a0So she'll drink a bit more, and eventually after 2 hours stop being low.\u00a0\u00a0And then the next morning, she'll be high.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping this new insulin helps.\u00a0\u00a0But we've never really gotten a direct answer from her past endo's about why that happens to her.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes she'll go along without this happening at all.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas on this?\u00a0\u00a0Is it normal for a juice or a coke to take 2 hours to help her BS?",
