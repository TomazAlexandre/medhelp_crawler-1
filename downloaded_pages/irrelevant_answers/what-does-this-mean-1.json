            "answer": "When you say dizzy, do you mean like the room is spinning or do you mean light-headed?\u00a0\u00a0If you mean light-headed, all the symptoms you describe could be caused by panic attacks, but you want to be careful to rule out an underlying medical problem, like does she have a hyperactive thyroid, does she have abnormal blood sugar, is she dehydrated, does she have a dysfunction of her autonomic nervous system, etc.?If you mean she feels like the room is spinning and with the nausea, you may want to take her to an ear nose and throat specialist for testing of her vestibular system & to see if she might have a problem with her ears, such as Meneire's disease.Also, how long have the symptoms been going on?\u00a0\u00a0Could she have a virus or an infection, with you working in a hospital?\u00a0\u00a0Have you taken her temperature?",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms can be due to acidity with H. pylori infection, hypothyroidism, hypoglycemia, low iron, or due to hormonal imbalance of PCOD.Since she has temperature fluctuations the first things to be ruled out are thyroid disorders, adrenal gland problems, anemia, diabetes, hypoglycemia, liver diseases, low Vit B12, and vasovagal attacks.Since I cannot examine her and know other related conditions she may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
