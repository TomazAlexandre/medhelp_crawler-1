            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are still in a dream like state/stupor/brain fog, then the electrolyte levels are probably still not normal.Then you also need to investigate other causes of brain fog like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause brain fog. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this.Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause.Hypothyroidism, diabetes and hormonal imbalance in women due to either menopause or any other cause like PCOD should be investigated. In men this could be related to low testosterone.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
