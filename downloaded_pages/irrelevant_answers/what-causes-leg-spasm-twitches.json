Cramps may be due to overexertion, muscle or nerve injury, prolonged immobilization, electrolyte imbalance, diabetes or even dehydration.\u00a0\u00a0Interestingly, pregnant women have a higher likelihood of experiencing these symptoms.Although it is no longer recommended, when I was studying the lower extremity, tonic water was recommended for these cramps, as they contained quinine.\u00a0\u00a0This is no longer recommended in the united States.Due to the many possibilities listed, I suggest that you consult your personal physician for a thorough workup.",
