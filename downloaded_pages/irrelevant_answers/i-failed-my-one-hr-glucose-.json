            "answer": "If you failed your 1h glucose test then its absolutely possible you have gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you do, its possible all you will need to do is monitor your diet but if you have a severe case you may need insulin injections until you deliver.\u00a0\u00a0Ive read lots of womens accounts who had GB and with the appropriate measures it can be controlled and tends to not be as much of a problem as you might think it is.",

            "answer": "Then again, what did you eat before? It could be that you ate something that was high in sugar or carbs and that affected it. Like Peanut Butter or bread. And spade is right, most women can control it with diet and its not a major problem. And another sigh of relief is that you might have it and as soon as the lil one arrives or a few days later it leaves. Good Luck",

            "answer": "Your right your not suppose to eat after midnight but sometimes you eat something the night before and it can still affect it. I know it sounds funny, but it happens. Mine was like that with my daughter and I remember eating a fudge round before I went to bed. It affected mine and after taking another test a few weeks later and them checking my sugar it wasn't that. Good Luck and if I can help you with anything let me know, I have a great aunt with diabetes and I check my sugar often just to make sure I am still in the clear.",

            "answer": "I have a friend who had GB and it wasn't as terrible as you might be anticipating... She had to check her blood sugar with a meter and watch her diet throughout the rest of her pregnancy but that was pretty much it. Of course everyone is different, but most likely if you do have GB that's what you'll have to do. I had to use a meter during my first trimester because i had HG and was hooked to an IV 24/7... I was receiving nutrients and sugars through the IV so they had to monitor me closely. The testing wasn't bad; it becomes like second nature. The meters they have nowadays hardly hurt at all and are really fast. As for my friend, she gained a significant amount of weigh during her pregnancy mostly due to the GB but her baby boy came out healthy, on time, and about 9lbs. I know you are worried about the baby, but if you do have GB know that it is entirely handle-able (is that a word?! lol)... Try not to worry too much and just take things as they come.... you and your baby will be just fine. :)",
