            "answer": "Hi Aroseamberrose.Both are associated with\u00a0\u00a0autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematosus\u00a0\u00a0and primary biliary cirrhosis and also are often present in Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.More tests are needed along with clinical symptoms to verify and diagnose any of these conditions.Please consider checking out an older thread here under Low T7- click on the magnifying icon above on this page.It has to do with Hypothyroidism,\u00a0\u00a0as an underlying condition, which\u00a0\u00a0frequently precedes certain autoimmune conditions.Also look into wheat/gluten sensitivity and also other food sensitivity like dairy, as it may be another contributing factor.Cyrex labs has a lot of info on this subject.Let me know if you need more details.Cheers,Niko",

            "answer": "Make sure your tests are not the standard ones, since they only indicate serum levels, which does not rule out thyroid resistance/type 2 hypothyroidsism.It's no different than in diabetes 2, where there is enough insulin, however, there's insulin resistance.Your concern is that your thyroid function is fine, not just the serum levels of your thyroid hormones.There are more people with thyroid-resistance than not and most of themare undiagnosed or worse misdiagnosed.It is not uncommon that unregulated or under-regulated hypothyroidism,leads to heart disease, fibromyalgia, Sjogren's, Lupus, etc.",
