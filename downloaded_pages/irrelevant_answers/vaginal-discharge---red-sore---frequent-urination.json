            "answer": "WHEN YOU GO TO OBYGEN ASK THEM TO TEST YOU FOR OTHER STD'S OTHER THAN THE USUAL BECAUSE THEY ALWAYS TEST FOR THE SAME ONES. SOUNDS LIKE TRICHOMONIASIS IT CAUSIS A BAD SMELL. WHAT EVER U DO DON'T HAVE SEX FOR AT LEAST A MONTH WITH TREATMENT + TREAT UR HUSBANDS OR THEY WILL GIVE IT BACK ( THIS IS THE SECRET THAT MDS DON'T TELL U THEY MAKE MORE $ IF U KEEP COMING BACK ).

            "answer": "I went through years of having supposed yeast infections.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor kept saying it was diabetes related. I kept having a discharge, not cottage cheese like but thin and smelly.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up at the University of Michigan for a biopsy because I would bleed and tear and I wasn't having sex and I had a hysterectomy.\u00a0\u00a0I found out I had an very rare auto immune disease.\u00a0\u00a0It is like lichen planus. If you have white patches and weird stuff it could be something other than a yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0Most GYNs don't know what it looks like either.",

    "question": "I had a baby in October, about two weeks later I noticed a VERY FOUL SMELL coming from my vagina. I had the usual discharge, then had my 6 week check up. The doctor said everything looked fine. I still have discharge. It is yellow and itches sometimes. My boyfriend told me I have a red sore-like spot on my labia minora (inside of my vagina, under the clitoris.) It's still there and itches frequently. I have to urinate frequently, it seems. The urine has a strong smell. I sometimes have lower pelvic pain. I went to the get tested for STDs, the gyno said everything was negative. I don't know what to think about this...I am so worried...someone, anyone just give me feedback to help me figure out what is wrong with me?",
