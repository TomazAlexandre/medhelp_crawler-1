            "answer": "Did you mean the thyroid tests were normal, not abnormal...if they were abnormal she would have been put on medication immediately.I wonder if you can go to your local doctor and get them to run the full thyroid function tests...not just TSH....I think you may find she could well be hypothyroid.I think the endo's remark about having a chunky child is uncalled for.Get the tests re-done and show us the results as you may know, that what one doctor thinks is normal is actually not normal at all. Many of them have no idea!Cheers!",

            "answer": "From those symptoms you have mentioned, the lack of ability to recite\u00a0\u00a0her ABC's etc.. that is typical hypo.. Get your daughter onto some medication as soon as possible. I feel you are getting mixed messages from the doctor. I think you will see a huge difference in your little girl if you just try the Synthroid. Don't worry, it is not going to stunt her growth, or anything horrible, if anything, it will help her! It is a natural replacement for what is missing in the thyroid.",

    "question": "Our daughter was a healthy 3 year old who for no reason started gaining weight at an alaming rate. In July of 06 she weighed\u00a0\u00a040 pounds. In July of 07 she weighed 52 pounds In September of 08 she was up to 76 pounds. We were sent to an endocrinologist in 07, who ran some bloodwork and said that everything was fine that we just had to accept the fact that we had a chunky child and that we needed to stop her from gaining weight.\u00a0\u00a0In September we were sent back to the endocrinologist who again ran some bloodwork and said that her Thyroid levels were abnormal just as they had been in 07.\u00a0\u00a0He also ran in depth test for diabetes and cushings all of which came back negative. However even with a strict diet at home of 1100 calories and daily exercise she continues to gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0Her resting metabolic was tested by a pediatric nutritionest and showed it to be between 1150 and1200.\u00a0\u00a0We have done everything we can to stop the weight gain and all the doctors will tell us is that we need to do more.\u00a0\u00a0her most recent gain was 3 pounds in 16 days.\u00a0\u00a0What can we do?",
