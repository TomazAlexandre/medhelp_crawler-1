            "answer": "I think you're right to keep searching for doctors who can answer your questions and make the pain go away.\u00a0\u00a0I suffer with severe abdominal pain\u00a0\u00a0(cramps, spasms?) that 5 weeks after gall bladder removal has gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0I've had many tests done and have no good answers yet.\u00a0\u00a0This is NOT any fun.Keep the faith and continue to be aggressive with your medical care. What you are experiencing is not normal and no doctor should make you accept your level of pain and your anxiety over your health.As for reference info, keep searching this site and the web in general.\u00a0\u00a0It may be hard for you to try to ID a cause with your diverse symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I have very specific, consistent symptoms and the GE can't nail down the cause of my pain.\u00a0\u00a0Just stay as informed as possible and push those doctors to go the extra mile for you.Good luck, let us know what you find and how you're doing!!Dave",

            "answer": "So, you had your GB removed and it didn't help -- same with me.\u00a0\u00a0Why don't we go to our doctors and ask if we can have our GBs back?\u00a0\u00a0I guess I'd better be careful what I ask for because he also removed a 1\" gallstone.\u00a0\u00a0Would he put that back in too?\u00a0\u00a0:-)I've had several things go wrong all at once and it's tempting to try to relate them all.\u00a0\u00a0In your case maybe there is that linkage between all these symptoms and one problem.\u00a0\u00a0For me I've had to separate them and see different doctors.\u00a0\u00a0A recent significant spike in blood sugar had me freaking out because diabetes runs in my family.\u00a0\u00a0I mentioned this to the GE and he could see no correlation between high blood sugar and my ab pain.\u00a0\u00a0So I had to pursue diabetes as a separate illness, and as it turns out it was a non-issue.\u00a0\u00a0I've read that blood sugar can spike as a result of pain, illness, or surgery -- I'm surprised the GE didn't mention that!!Okay, enough ranting.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck navigating your way through this frustrating mess called health care.",

Dr has requested blood work and ultrasound. I'm waiting to get this done. I want to say by what all of you have posted, I know it is all related.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know how far it will go, I hope I don't have cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Also Jane I have thought I was going crazy also. Even thought of checking into hospital because of it. I have slowly quit taking Prozac thinking maybe it was my meds, but it was not. My pancreas and liver are causing all these problems, I believe it is also your problem too. I pray for you all, thank you!",
