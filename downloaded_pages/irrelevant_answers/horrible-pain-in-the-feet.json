            "answer": "Hi.If the pain has been already there 7 years ago and he was only diagnosed 3 years ago, then it may be unlikely that the CLL can fully explain the pain.This could be a separate problem with the nerves, or a primary neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0This in turn can be caused by nerve root compression (from the spine), electrolyte imbalances (like potassium, calcium, etc) or from micronutrient deficiency.I suggest he'd discuss these possibilities with his doctors, and also get opinion on prescription drugs such as gabapentin or pregabalin to specifically address neuropathic type of pain.Regards.",
