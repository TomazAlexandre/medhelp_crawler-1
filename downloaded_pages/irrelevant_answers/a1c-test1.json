            "answer": "OK, let's first do some analysis of your A1c levels and what they equate to on a daily estimated blood sugar level [eAG].1. Five months ago it was 6.4%. This equates to an eAG of 137 mg/dl2. Then you say \"a1c 8.0\". This equates to an eAG of 183 mg/dl.3. Recent is 6.2%. This equates to an eAG of 131 mg/dl.Normal A1c is <5% or an eAG of <99 mg/dl. As you can see you still have a ways to go.You have the correct mindset by using diet and exercise to help lower your blood sugars. I cannot speak for your doctor but can assume that he/she feels your levels are not lowering the way they should.Constant high blood sugar levels compounded by excessive weight is hard on your kidneys and cardio system. This may be the reason behind doctor suggesting medication. Medication helps to lower your levels along with diet, exercise, and maintaining normal body weight. Normal Lipid panels play an important role too. You may give medication a try to see if it does help. If it does, and you obtain normal A1c values with medication and a healthy lifestyle, then there is no reason to continue the meds. But by all means continue with the healthy lifestyle. Good luck -",

            "answer": "\" why are the a1c 6.2 and the hbga1c 7.7 so far apart.\"Unsure of what you're asking. Your first post has, \"a1c 6.2 hgb a1c (6 months average) 7.7.\" but doesn't tell how you arrived at 7.7. Also, you don't average A1c's unless you are saying the 7.7% was 6 months after the 6.2%. Needs claification.You might want to question your doctor why he/she feels an A1c of 7.4% is normal as 7.4% equates to an eAG of 166 mg/dl, unacceptable.",

            "answer": "Here's where the confusion lay's. The A1c [HbA1c] and hemoglobin [hgb] are two separate tests. To help clarify the confusion, the tests in a nutshell.The A1c is determined by measuring the percentage of glycated hemoglobin, or HbA1c, in the blood looking back 2-3 months. It would be impossible to come up with a 6 month A1c average looking forward.Your doctor may perform a hemoglobin test [hgb] if you're experiencing weakness, fatigue, shortness of breath or dizziness. These signs and symptoms may point to anemia or polycythemia vera [bone marrow issues]. He/she can check hemoglobin variability by calculating the 1 month and 2 to 6 month rolling average hemoglobin for each patient.If still unclear, contact your doctor for clarification.HTH",

In prediabetes, A1C levels range between 5.7%-6.4%. If the A1C is 6.5% or above, a person has diabetes.\"\u00a0\u00a0This range is 114 mg/dl - 137 mg/dl, high in my books, considering t2 diabetes begins at 126 mg/dl. Your optimum goal is <5%, if not strive for <5.6%.Remember, your home glucose test meter is a very good friend. It doesn't lie and tells you the truth. Know your testing times and test often. Know the foods and drinks to avoid, and exercise 30-60 mins daily. And, maintain a healthy normal body weight too.",
