            "answer": "I failed to realize readers may consider the content of my previous story (which I now regret sharing) without seeking the advice of a physician, which absolutely should never be done.\u00a0\u00a0Let me add more clearly that my mother\u2019s doctor was fully aware of the added supplement even though he agreed the same with the previous commentor-There is not enough scientific evidence to support a lack of chromium as one of the underlying causes of some Type II diabetes cases.Please be aware, by forgetting to eat, 911 had to be called on several occasions.\u00a0\u00a0Low sugars are deadly.\u00a0\u00a0Our particular situation forced us to seek alternatives by diet and later adding this particular supplement.\u00a0\u00a0Glucose levels were monitored 3-5 times a day from home.\u00a0\u00a0The physician, fully aware of every change made, continued to fully monitor her through blood work for the next three years, every four months.\u00a0\u00a0He now checks it once a year.I would be interested in reading further evidence about the previous comment, \u201cIf Diabetic Type II, Chromium has the potential to block insulin causing blood sugar levels to rise.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0I didn\u2019t see this anywhere in the referenced source provided.\u00a0\u00a0In all of my research I've never come across this, so please comment back on the source(s) that provide support to this claim.The reliability of the website sited in the response, is confusing if not questionable.\u00a0\u00a0It refers in one sentence to the difficulties of accurately measuring chromium levels, and then turns around and states, \u201cIn general, however, individuals with Type II Diabetes have low blood levels of chromium.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0This is very ambiguous, and borderlines contradicting.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, there\u2019s an inference to readers that Type II Diabetics are tested for chromium levels.\u00a0\u00a0So, where is this information coming from if doctors do not test for chromium?I\u2019m still seeking an answer, but maybe I\u2019m asking the wrong question.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a reason doctors do not test nor acknowledge chromium when running diagnostics tests for Type II Diabetes or are we, as patients, not asking the right questions?\u00a0\u00a0I would like to hear back from a doctor\u2019s point of view if possible.",

            "answer": "Doctors usually don't tell everything you need to know for many political reasons. My experience with doctors have never been good. The choice of drugs to prescribe to patients is mostly based on doctors' business deals with pharmacy industry. Any cheap solution for cure, however promising, will be abandoned at first sight because that will be a loss of profits to the more expensive solutions.There are many deseases that can be prevented and reversed simply by normalizing blood sugar. Sadly, even the ADA (american diabetes assoc) sets a misleading guideline on \"what normal glucose level is\". ADA even sets a food pyramid which will only worsen diabetic patients.My advice is: test, test, test. Use your chromium supplement in moderation and check its effect on the BS. For example, you can consume certain meals for a period of time and check the bs everytine (before and after meal). Then on a different period of time, consume the same meals with chromium supplement and see how meals and bs during each period compare.",

    "question": "Why do Doctors not test for chromium deficiency in diabetic patients?\u00a0\u00a0For 27 years my mother was treated for diabetes by pills.\u00a0\u00a0In her early eighties, her doctor began increasing the dosage in an effort to help regulate her increasing blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Due to her memory declining and thereby forgetting to eat after taking the medicine, we discontinued her pills and began monitoring her blood sugars and diet to attempt keeping her in a reasonable blood glucose range.\u00a0\u00a0With these changes, we managed to keep her sugar between 140 and 180 on average.\u00a0\u00a0About a year later we added a product made by Nutrition 21 of chromium, biotin, and magnesium which immediately began bringing her sugar levels to normal.\u00a0\u00a0Over the next three years, her blood work results were at or within the normal range. The doctor eventually ceased her bloodwork every four months and began including it only as a part of her annual checkup work.\u00a0\u00a0When we began this regimen, I attempted to have him take the time and read the pamplet about the Nutrition 21 get his feedback on the product.\u00a0\u00a0He declined.\u00a0\u00a0What I do not understand is why not only my mother's but most other physicians as well, diagnose thousands of people every year with diabetes, yet I do not hear where any of them associate or test for this possible cause.\u00a0\u00a0Is there some particular reason doctors fail to test for appropriate nutrient levels as a root cause of diabetes before they they begin their lifelong treatments of the symptoms?",
