            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, it could be due to the medications of high BP especially with drugs like beta blockers. So talk to the doctor who prescribed the drugs. Cold peripheries or cold hands and feet can happen due to peripheral vascular disease or disorder of the circulatory system outside of the brain and heart. Other causes of cold extremities are hypothyroidism, eating disorders like anorexia, Addison\u2019s disease, adrenal causes like pheochromocytoma, anemia, Buerger\u2019s disease, chronic fatigue syndrome and Raynaud\u2019s disease. You will need some tests like treadmill test, color Doppler, angiography, ultrasonography and MRI (magnetic resonance imaging).Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
