            "answer": "HI. I wouldn't worry to much until u find out the results. Just do what your dr told u to do for the 3 hour test.If you do end up having g/d, it's not to bad. I have it. You go by a diet, eating each of the food groups in each meal, and staying away from sugar. he/she will try that first to keep your sugar down, he will prescribe a monitor and strips to test yourself. Now if that doesn't help he'll presribe the insulin, and it doesn't hurt to stick yourself or anything, alil pain afterwards but nothing u can't handle.I had to go in with the diet just once a month then he checks your log u keep.With insulin i started going every wk, then if i'm maintaining my levels i got to move up to 2 wks. next wk when i go back if it's still good he'll go 3 wks.Well good luck!",

            "answer": "I have had 5 babies. ON all of them my one hour was about 145. I passed the 3 hour on the first 4 preg and failed my last one. I was diagnosed with GD had to do the diet. Mine was very controlled by diet and my numbers were all fine. I gained NO more weight the entire pregnancy once I started on the diet. Basically I just cut my portions and ate healthy snacks. Eating fast food was the biggest NO NO. That was the only time my sugars went high. It forces you to watch your diet because they watch your numbers and you will have to take insulin if it can't be controlled by diet. It was a very good eye opener to me on what I eat and how it affects me.",

            "answer": "Hi Petanka! In my first pregnancy I had 139 and failed the 3 hour, in the second it was 159 and I passed the 3 hour. Go figure! I hope you don't have it or that you can easily control it with your diet. If you can't though, don't be afraid of insuline. Insuline shots hurt less than testing your bloodsugar and once you're on it, you get to eat more carbs!!!Btw, they take blood 4 times for the 3 hour test and you can have 1 high number. And walking around can help keep your sugarlevel down. Good luck!",

    "question": "Hello ladies. I just got the results from my 1 hour glucose test and I was just wondering if any of you took the 1 hour test and your results were over 150 and after the 3 hours test everything turned out OK? My 1 hour test came back over 150 and I am going to do the 3 hours test tomorrow. I am so upset! This pregnancy has been such a struggle. I still have morning sickness therefore take Zofran, have been through 2 surgeries and now this! Those of you who ended up with gestational diabetes, how often did you have to go to the Dr. office, did it require more US and how bad is the diet?Petanka",
