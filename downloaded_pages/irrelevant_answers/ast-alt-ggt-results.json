            "answer": "Your GGT level is the highest of the three, so perhaps the following will be helpful to you:Gamma-glytamyl transpeptidase is an enzyme which is found in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells. GGT may be high in liver disease. In particular it is a feature of biliary outflow obstruction rather than hepatocellular damage.* GGT (in men) = 11 - 50 i.u./l* GGT (in women) = 7 - 32 i.u./lNote reference ranges may vary between laboratories.GGT serum measurement provides a very sensitive indicator of the presence or absence of hepatobiliary disease. However the usefulness of measurement of serum GGT is limited by its lack of specificity. Raised GGT levels have been reported in a variety of clinical conditions including (1):* pancreatic disease* myocardial infarction* chronic obstructive pulmonary disease* renal failure* diabetes* alcoholismDrugs such as phenytoin and barbiturates may cause high GGT levels (2).The reported sensitivity of a raised GGT for detecting alcohol ingestion has ranged from 52% to 94% (3,4).",

I have an apointment to see a specialist in 2 weeks but I'm concerned about this and would like to get as much information as I could. I'm guesing these results are a result of my alcohol consumption but I was wondering how serious does it sound or any information that anyone can give.Thanks so much",
