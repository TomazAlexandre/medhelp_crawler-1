            "answer": "Hi VermaThere are no medical professionals on this board; this is a peer board. If your A1C is creeping up (you don't say if it is going higher) that might mean that the oral meds are no longer effective because your pancreas is no longer producing sufficient insulin. Do you test on a regular basis? If your numbers are consistently high this also might be an indication of the above. Your doctor can do a c-peptide test which will assess how much insulin your pancreas is actually making. You have maintained your diabetes on oral meds for a very long time...average is more like 10-12 years. Your pancreas just may have stopped working. Please be sure and check this out and don't let your reluctance to consider insulin stop you from taking care of yourself.",

            "answer": "What is \"was 126 ( 7.00 mol/lit.)\"? Normally mol/lit used to measure electrolyte secretion during a fasting. For glucose, the European standard is mmol/l [lower case L's] as to where 7 mmol/l is consider above normal [high being 6.1 mmol/l] - diabetes not being controlled. Over time you will need to make medication adjustments to compensate for your above normal glucose range. If you unsure of the advice previously given go seek a second medical opinion from another doctor preferably an Endocrinologist, a doctor that specializes in diabetes care and treatment.",

            "answer": "Hi Zoelula,Thanks for your response. My A1C has always been between 6.5 to 6.8 and sometimes 7 mmol/l that was o.k. for my doctor. But what puzzels me is the intervention of a diabetic nurse. However, I am going to see my G.P. about it.Thanks againP.S. I check my blood sugar first thing in the morning before i take my breakfast everyday. So, I never let it stay at a high level.regardsVerma",

    "question": "I am new to this forum.I\u00a0\u00a0was born in India and now live in The Netharlands. I am a diabetic 2 since last 30 years.I take 8mg of Amaryl in the morning and 2 to 4mg in the evening (prescribed by an Internist 14 years ago). I also take Metformine 1000mg once in the morning and once in the evening. My last\u00a0\u00a0HbA1c (in February,2009) was 126 ( 7.00 mol/lit.)I was asked to see a diabetic nurse (as a normal routine) and she has aproblem with the\u00a0\u00a0dose of drugs that I take and advises me to shift to insulin. The doctors did not have any problem with my medication though. I am not happy with this advice from her. Could any medical professional help me with advice as to which other medication I can shift to. I will be most grateful.ThanksVerma Sham",
