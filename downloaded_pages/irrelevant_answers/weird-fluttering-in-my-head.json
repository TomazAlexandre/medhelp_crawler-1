            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Mild fluttering here and there can be due to albuterol too. Other than that it can be due to pinched cervical spinal nerves, clot in a blood vessel, localized dermatitis or even dandruff. Peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes too could be a cause. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
