            "answer": "Get off drugs for a start, quit smoking, quit alcohol for good, get off any fast foods, quit any sexual practices for a few weeks, and get your body healthy, exercise is a good way to go, everything we put into our bodys effects the way our bodys work, once you can get your body clean inside and out then perhaps you can start again, but this time do it the claen way, but the thing you need to watch the most is your possable diabetes, this is not a good thing as this brings on ED and something you should keep at the back of your mind.There are lots of herbs out there that can help with erections, and they work, me I'm now in ed recovery because of herbs and hormons.Good Luck",

    "question": "Well okay, I'm seventeen years old.This started happening, I would say in 2009, I can't really recall fully, since my perception of time, is alot different than others.Anyways, I started having sex very young, a few months after 13, I never had problems, but from what I remember, I started having troubles, around summer of 2009.We had quite a bit of sex, about every day, multiple times, for four or five months, now, the story behind all of this, is unimportant, so I will cut to the chase, what happened, was, I would withhold an erection, then I would lose it.It had nothing to do with physical attraction, or mental anxiety at the time, it would just happen.Oral sex, Intercourse, everything, I would be slightly hard, and then once I would penetrate, I would start to lose it.I have experimented, so I know it's not something of sexual orientation, I love women, without a doubt, so I don't know what it could be.What made it even worse, was that for a while, she would just make me feel like complete crap about it, I have read up alot on this subject, and I read that sexual anxiety, can really effect my erection.At seventeen, I shouldn't be having any problems.Now, I am a few months to eighteen, I am ready to speak to a doctor when I turn 18, since I feel that, they would be able to help me more, than if I were underage.I did take a cialis before, and I maintained a full erection, and that's about it.I have had quite a bit of sex, since it started happening.But, it's never fully there, I have just learned to use it, how it is.But for years, it has been a very big problem of mine, and on top of that, it has also caused me A LOT of depression, and even more anxiety.I know it's just not me worrying and just mental, but I know that definitely doesn't help.Diabetes runs in the family, I sometimes do get lightheaded from eating things with alot of sugar, and when I got my physical around a year and a half ago, my docor said I had a high amount of protein in my urine, which is a sign of diabetes, possibly.I never found out the test results, so I just watched my diet just in case.I honestly, have not been to the doctors, aside for that quick physical, in around five or six years.I have always had many problems, my mom was a medical student, so she just took it, as if she could tell me all my problems and not take me to the doctors for anything.So I don't know if something physical is happening in my body, and that it can be the cause of this.Aside from the possibility of physical problems that cause it, I am always very stressed, I am always very hot, as if my pores are closed and my skin is not breathing, I smoke cigarettes regularly.About a pack every 24 hours.Been smoking since around the same time it started happening, maybe a few weeks or a month after it started.Could that be a problem?What questions should I ask my new doctor, about what's been happening.?I'm sorry that I have so many questions, but I have wanted to ask people for so long, and always been to embarrassed and afraid to, and I can't talk to the people my age, because how immature they are, they would just speak down to me for it, instead of giving me logical advice or anything.",
