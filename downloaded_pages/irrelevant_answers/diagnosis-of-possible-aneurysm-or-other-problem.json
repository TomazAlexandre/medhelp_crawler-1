    "question": "Hi, Ive had a pulsating abdomen since I was 19, Im 24 now. the doctor ruled out an aneurysm when i was 19, but an abdominal scan was not performed. I am terrified of having an aneurysm. Ive recently ( past 1-2 months) have had the following symptoms: I can feel pulsations in my arms and legs, sometimes my neck from time to time throughout the day, I have social anxiety, when i workout at the gym and do abdominal exercises my abs spasm up. Im very thin, 170 lbs and i am 5' 11\". I also have vitiligo, however its very light an unnoticeable except on my penis where there is a strip of white. I was using a product called chromelin to cover that area? Is that safe? Can you please post your thoughts. Thanks.",
