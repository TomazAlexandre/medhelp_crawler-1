            "answer": "A good friend of mine had gestational diabetes.. she had to watch her sugar intake.. (basically eat well - nothing too extreme) - she gained alot of weight (because she DIDN'T follow the doctors orders) and the baby was big (almost 10 lbs).. because SHE didn't follow the Dr.s orders, the babies blood sugar was REALLY low when he was born..they had to keep a close eye on him for a few hours before they let him out of the nursery. He also had jaundice, but I don't think that we related to the diabetes. Basically, SHE didn't do what she was told to do, so if you follow the rules you and the baby should be fine.",

            "answer": "I am the person to talk to, lol!In 2002 I got pregnant with my son, ended up failing my 1 hour glucose, took and failed the 3 hour as well. I was put on a strict \"diet\" and had to check my blood sugar levels at home. I managed to keep my blood sugar levels under good control until 2 weeks before my due date. My levels started getting higher, I gained 3 lbs in one week so my OB decided to induce me 2 days before my due date. He used the gel twice, 8 hours apart, and then the next day lunch time my water broke. In the end, I had a c-section, my son was 9lbs 10oz and my OB told me that he was the reason I failed to progress (he was just too big). His weight was due to the gestational diabetes.Now on to this pregnancy. I am currently 36 weeks 4 days. I again had to take the 1 hour glucose test, failed and again took and failed the 3 hour test. We tried for a few weeks to control my blood sugar levels with diet alone but found that my levels were rising no matter what I did. As of Friday I am now on insulin. I have to give myself an injection of insulin 4 times a day as well as still be on the \"diet\".The \"diet\" I am talking about is: limit carbs, NO SUGAR, and lots of protein. The protein helps to slow down the digestion of the carbs.I have heard of people failing the 1 hour but passing the 3 hour, from what I have read (especially on the Maternal/Child forum of this site) it is actually quite common.If you have anymore questions, feel free to ask and I'll do my best to answer them.",

            "answer": "here comes a barrage of questions lol..did your son (or your friends son for the first poster) have any effects from the diabetes as far as long term effects (more significnat than jaundice...).\u00a0\u00a0i've had two normal pregnancies with my daughters and now this is a son and wham... it's like murphy's law... everything that can go wrong, is.As far as the strict diet... what does that consist of?\u00a0\u00a0more so strict food or strict times?\u00a0\u00a0my problem is this:\u00a0\u00a0i just recently had my second daughter... she's 9 months old right now.\u00a0\u00a0she'll be 12 months when this baby is born.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone who has small children knows that a set suppertime with children that small is a joke...\u00a0\u00a0for instance, i would have a hard time if someone gave me a paper and said \"you need to eat at 8 am, 12 noon, and 5 pm with a light snack before bed\".the more i read and the more I speak with people, the more i think im probably going to fail the 3 hour test miserably.\u00a0\u00a0I've had a chronic yeast infection, which is new for me, and im just dizzy and tired more often than normal.\u00a0\u00a0My sister (the mother of my insulin dependent diabetic nephew) seems to think that my number of 160 is more abnormal than what I originally thought, especially because I fasted prior to taking it.thanks for the comments tho... and please add to them... reading other people's stories kind of helps get me prepared for anything, if that makes sense.",

            "answer": "My son had no last effects other than being a big baby. He will be 4 in January and is as normal as normal can be :).The diet is not really a time thing, it is more restricting certain foods and cutting back on others. I am supposed to have breakfast, lunch, snack, supper, nighttime snack. They are not a certain times but I am supposed to try and have 4 hours between my meals. Now with being on insulin, it's more of a set time thing, but that is because I have to \"inject\" myself 1/2 before I eat.For example, my breakfast is 2 peices whole wheat toast, 2 fried eggs, 2 pieces fried ham or bologna, 1 cup of milk.You have certain amounts that you are allowed. Like on my sheet it says that I am allowed milk with my meals and my nighttime snack but it is only 1 cup. I am allowed to have certain things anytime I want, they are called \"free foods\" - all veggies except corn and potatoes. Diet pop, crystal light and water.I am sure that if you fail the 3 hour, you will be sent to see a diabetic nurse and a dietitian, who will help you.If you would like, you can email me at sask_sweetheart at yahoo dot com.I would be happy to continue answering your questions and maybe even scan and email you some of the info that I have in regards to gestational diabetes.",

            "answer": "I couldn't help but comment. I had GD with both of my children. Both times it was diet controled. I was also required to check my blood sugar 5 times a day. The diet consisted of my dr setting how many calories she wanted me to have a day, then my nutricianlist told me how many carbs and protein I would need with each meal. I also had to eat about every 2hrs. But b/c I kept my levels low my 1st ds was 7.13 lbs and my 2nd ds was 6.14 lbs. so it isn't really all that bad if you do fail. Just follow what your dr tells you. If your dr tries to make lite of it, do your own research or feel free to e-mail me at brandy_bodiford***@**** and I will answer any questions you have. Hope this helps. Best of luck tomorrow.",
