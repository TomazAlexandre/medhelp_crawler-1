            "answer": "Also, i have been getting a bit too many burps, not a complete burp though. Just comes half way. And i have abdominal pain, especially lower. i have constipation as well. 2 days ago, i also had pain in the joints. My urine test is completely normal, i dont have diabetes either. The doctor said that she sees nth wrong in me. Rather she asked me to stop all medications and just continue with allegra and v wash. Is allegra an antifungal medicine? I couldnot tell her about fingerind and all since she is a family doctor. I have been taking a lot of stress past 3 weeks. Please, could i be infected with any kind of STD in any way?",

            "answer": "Thanks. My doctor took a swab today , i'll get the results day after. But after she looked at me, she was like \"you have had a sexual contact\" . But i never did. Just fingering and dry sex. Could there be risk for any other diseases like PID or cervical cancer ?",

    "question": "Hello,I dont know if whatever im feeling is even close to this but here it is.I'm 18 and i have been having on and off itch for past 6 months. 9 months a ago, my boyfriend and i dry humped sometimes with/without our tshirts. We always had our pants on. Also he used to finger me, this happened maybe 4 times. A month a ago, he again fingered me thrice. My doctor prescribed me a medicine that had to be orally taken 1 per week for 6 weeks. And an antifungal cream as well. This was 6 months back.I was all okay but sometimes i felt the itch again. 3 weeks back, i had immense itching agan with vaginal discharge and she prescribed me a medicine to have 1 in morning and 1 at night. Now there is no discharge just a little itching. But i have been having a slight pain in the pelvis and lower abdomen and also sometimes in the vagina.Could this in anyway be std? My boyfriend is very sure he doesnt have any stds. We never had any kinds of sex except fingering and dry humping on clothes. He also hasnt had sex with anyone else. Could this be std? I'd be really thankful for your response.",
