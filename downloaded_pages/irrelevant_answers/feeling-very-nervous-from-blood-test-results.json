            "answer": "Hi.May I presume this is a fasting result?The Hba1c is slightly high, but the fasting blood sugar is high enough to put you in the prediabetic range.\u00a0\u00a0Triglycerides are high, HDL is low.You are likely in early stages of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0To address this:-1. Low carb, moderate protein, higher fat (fat is for added calories / replace the carbs reduced).\u00a0\u00a0The high triglycerides should also improve on a lower carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0Paleo or mediteranean style (without the bread/pasta/potato) are a good approach.2. Lose weight if you are overweight.3. Exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise will also help improve HDL.4. Avoid transfats / man-made fats (eat healthy fats - also to help HDL).5. A glass of red wine regularly may also help with the HDL levels.It may be a good idea to monitor blood sugar occasionally 1 1/2 - 2 hours after eating to see if you are going high. Ideally your peak will be < 120.",

            "answer": "i posted link to article but didnt go through. it was by someone who support low carb high fat but even he say that insulin resistance get worse long term because brain still need glucose and since there is so little carbs body adapts by making muscle insulin resistance higher so that some glucose is left for the brain. so if a person on low carb diet suddenly eat carbs then blood sugar goes high because muscle dont absorb it anymore. not sure if can be reversed or not. maybe low carb high fat is one way street?",

            "answer": "The issue may not be the 'diet' but rather than insulin resistance typically progresses over time as people get older.In non-diabetic persons, regardless of what is eaten, blood sugars will not go high.In persons with diabetes or prediabetes, I am afraid it is a one way street.\u00a0\u00a0IF the person goes back to eating a typical high carb diet then blood sugars will be correspondingly hard to manage.The muscles will not be able to absorb the carbs well because there is not enough insulin present to make that happen.Brain does not necessarily need significant glucose.\u00a0\u00a0Brain can function equally well on ketone bodies (in some medical conditions like epilepsy, alzheimers, the brain using ketone bodies instead of glucose may reduce symptoms.it is an interesting area of research.",

            "answer": "yes i find now article on wikipedia that says brain can work on ketones. i am trying to understand this diet. many article on insulin resistance but i found studies where insulin resistance get better by losing fat and building muscle because muscle respond better to insulin. another study says high intensity training improve insulin resistance because high intensity like sprint can only work on glucose can not work on ketones. many conflict studies about low carb high fat. seem like new area. but i know for fact my friends who on paleo and not diabetic have high sugar when they eat carbs. also found articles about oral glucose tolerance test they say not to eat low carb before the test because can make test result higher. not sure how it works some say insulin resistance get worse if you eat low carb other say insulin response get worse. seem like nobody know exactly.",

A difficult adjustment especially with a close friend that loves to please me with wonderful desserts for the weekend.\u00a0\u00a0I recenty did some research on getting reliable health information on the internet.

I found that the information from Wiki needs to be confirmed in a couple of other sources to be sure the info is reliable. The National\u00a0\u00a0Institute of Health has a wealth of information.",
