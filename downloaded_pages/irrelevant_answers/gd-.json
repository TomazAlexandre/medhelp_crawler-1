It's easy stuff like egg wires cheese and salsa with toast for breakfast, a yogurt for snack later. Half a turkey sandwich and a chip of milk with grapes for lunch and a snack of peanut butter toast and a cup of milk. Lol that was what got me through it. Good luck!",

But they will first have you check your sugars 4 times a day on a diet(I'm on it and its pretty easy) if you can keep your sugars in the good range then they won't put you on medicine. And if they do it will most likely be a pill form. Unless you keep your sugars way too high then it might be possible you're a real diabetic.",
