            "answer": "Presuming her heart stopped for less than 1 minute, there should not be any permament neurological sequelae from thisBlurred vision and slurred speech are quite non-specific symptoms especially in the absence of any other neurological abnormalities on a good neurological history and examination. They can be due to anything from medication side effects to chronic respiratory failure (such as not being able to breath out enough carbon dioxide), diabetes and other metabolic issues, etc. A neurological cause is less likely unless a stroke occurred which would show up on the MRI anyway. An EEG may be beneficial to see if there is any sign of a medicaition or medical related encephalopathy as well as the usual blood tests. A good ophthalmologic exam should also be sought as sometimes with rapid loss of blood or low blood pressure, there may be ischemic damage to the retina or optic nerve. Only time will tell if it will improve or not, but it probably will.Good luck",

    "question": "My wife, 37 years old, suffered approx. one month ago a massive pulmonary embolism, 2 days after a birth with Ceasarean cut. Following to that, she had a heart failure, which -according to the doctors- was of very short duration (less than 1 minute). After regaining consciousness, she did have normal communication, and her memory has completely recovered after a few days. The magneto-tomographies of the brain didn't show brain damages.But, still, approx. 1 month after the event, she has the following symptoms: a) blurred vision; b) slightly slurred speech.My questions to you are: are the above symptoms usual after such an event? Are these symptoms of neurological nature? Will these symptoms recover with time - if yes after how long?Thank you very much for your kind reply.",
