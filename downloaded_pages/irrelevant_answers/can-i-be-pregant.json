            "answer": "So basically your period is 3 weeks late,\u00a0\u00a0and you took a pregnancy test last week?If you did the test according to the directions,\u00a0\u00a0it's unlikely that you're pregnant,\u00a0\u00a0although as rehma says, it's possible.You have two things that could have caused your menstrual period to stop - a really great amount of weight gain in a very short period of time,\u00a0\u00a0 and working out at the gym.\u00a0\u00a0Either of those things can cause your periods to stop.Gaining 17 pounds in the first 6 weeks isn't a sign of pregnancy - it's a symptom of extreme over eating or some other condition,\u00a0\u00a0like diabetes.The fact that you have had that large weight gain so quickly - AND you've begun to workout often - it's likely that those things have caused your delayed period.",
