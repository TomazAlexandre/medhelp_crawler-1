            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!These symptoms are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "INFO: SVT when young , Smoker ( light ) , Tea drinker , not very much excersise..PROBLEM:Ive been having sudden rapid throbbing/palpitations that last for\u00a0\u00a02 seconds everytime, that occur in my heart on my left leg mainly and occasionally in the top right hand side of my head. Other things that happen are sudden faint clench like feeling round my chest heart side also sometimes in the leg and head. Sometimes i feel weak. My left arm always seems strained or somewhat slightly numb with ocassional nerve pains down the length of the arm.I really want to know what this could be, i think it may be something to do with anxiety as my mum has it.I have been like this for nearly 2 years but never had problems like this.",
