            "answer": "I have been T1 for 27 years and my 17 year old daughter, Caroline, has just been diagnosed as T1. I know what a pain it is to be totally dependent on injected insulin. And I have been looking for ways to soften the blow for Caroline. Here is my take on it. And I hope you find the ideas useful.Good news and bad news here. Bad news first. Type 1 Diabetes is is the result of an autoimmune attack on beta cells in the pancreas. Once beta cells have been destroyed, there is no way of getting them back again. And by the time symptoms manifest and keytones appear in the urine, 80% of beta cells have already been destroyed.So it is not possible to \"grow out\" of T1 Diabetes. If your son has T1, and it sounds like he does, the capacity of his pancreas to produce insulin will have altready been permanently reduced by perhaps 80%. But, and this is the good news, it may be possible to prolong the life of remaining beta cells for many years.Because the remaining beta cells are already working at least 4 times harder than they they did before the autoimune attack, they will be taking a lot of strain. Your challenge now is to relieve that strain as far as possible. It will lengthen the life of remaining beta cells and extend the \"honeymoon period\".During the \"honeymoon\", controlling blood sugars is fairly easy. Remaining insulin production capacity of the pancreas means that not much injected insulin is required. Blood sugars return to the normal range reasonably quickly after eating. And only a small amount of injected insulin is required. Obviously, the longer this lasts the better.It is now generally recognised that beta cells can be preserved by injecting small amounts of insulin, even if reasonable control can be achieved without it. It means that the remaining beta cells don't have to work so hard. It is also important that blood glucose spikes are avoided because they are apparently toxic to the remaining beta cells and hasten their demise.Reducing carbohydrate in the diet is perhaps the easiest way to relieve the strain on beta cells. Obviously, the beta cells don't have to work as hard to process a reduced and more evenly spread-out glucose load.Caroline is doing lots of tests to learn exactly how different foods affect her blood sugars. She has switched to a low-carb diet - 60 grams of carbohydrate a day. And she is injecting small amounts of Novorapid before meals to avoid blood glucose spikes.After two weeks of working at it, her control is pretty good. And, because she is in the honeymoon stage, achieving good control is not difficult. Her plan is to keep it that way as long as possible.If your son has T1, you have a limited window of opportunity. You are able to retain a degree of endogenous insulin production for the foreseeable future. But it will be hard work.Best of luck,Mark",

            "answer": "Markie,You've outlined things very well, however, with one very important mistake:\u00a0\u00a0there is no known way to stop the autoimmune response to the remaining beta cells during or after the \"honeymoon period\".\u00a0\u00a0In other words, eventually, probably on the order of weeks, all of the remaining beta cells will be destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0At that point, the type 1 diabetic will rely entirely upon manually administered insulin.As I understand things, type 2 is another story:\u00a0\u00a0the mechanism is different, and so anything done to help (drugs, diet, supplemental insulin) will give relief to the remaining cells to continue to live and keep producing insulin.If something could be done to change or stop the body's specific autoimmune response in Type 1 diabetics, there's a Nobel Prize waiting.Good luck to all,Tony",

            "answer": "Hi SilverbellGet as much information as you can on T1 diabetes ask your sons doctor questions and have him explaine what the medical terms mean having a child with T1 diabetes you are learning all the time my daughter like your son was 5 when she was diagnosed she is 27 now how his diabetes is looked after now will have an effect on how his health is later its not easy when your child is first diagnose as you do have to make some changes to their eating habits but that doesnt mean he can never have some of his favourite foods you will come across many people who will think that he developed diabetes because he was eating to much sugary thing or who think it will go away like measles when in fact what you ate doesnt have anything to do with developing diabetes and once you have T1 you have it the rest of your life it wont be easy to understand everything at the begining but you do get a very good understanding of it as time goes on and you do learn how to know by your childs actions if their blood sugars are going too low or too high but it all comes with time and understanding I wish you well in what can sometimes be a stressfull time for everybody",
