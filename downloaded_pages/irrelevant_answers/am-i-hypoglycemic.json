            "answer": "hi! im a 25 yr. old female that is trying to figure out what is wrong with me for the past year or so. These symptoms just keep getting worse and are becoming chronic. It first started with the vertigo that happened on 3 occassions but i have constant dizzy spells after i work out or midway in my routine and im not even lifting as hard as i use to because of this. Its annoying that my daily schedule has to revolve around my persistant headaches and dizziness.....Oh but the worst part are what I thought were panic attacks almost every night or sometimes they won't occur for a week or two....I wake up within the first hour or two hours that i fall asleep and am totally \"lost\" and begin to get cold and shake uncontrollably for like 15 minutes. Its scary! Sometimes I feel like im gonna black out. A doctor gave me xanax for it but honestly it doesnt help because sometimes i fall back asleep and it happens again. On three nights I woke up every hour on the hour with these like shock feelings in my body and was totally out of it!!!! Any advice? Does it sound like hypoglycemia? As soon as I get insurance i'm goin to the doctor.....Sincerely",

    "question": "I have been having vague symptoms throughout my body for the last 10 months.\u00a0\u00a0Initially my symptoms appeared to be urinary tract related with pain and discomfort on my left flank, lower back and left Kidney area as well as pelvic and lower abdominal pain and discomfort. After numerous scans(X-ray, CT scan with and w/o contrast, and ultrasound) and several lab tests to check for proper organ and metabolic function, the only finding was a simple cyst on my left Kidney and a calcification on my right Kidney.\u00a0\u00a0The Urologist said this is not a problem would not be the source of my pain and discomfort and referred me back to my GP, who said it was most likely musculoskeletal and left it at that.\u00a0\u00a0Since that time I have also developed vague Gastro-intestinal symptoms such as Gas, bloating, abdominal pain and discomfort, back pain, muscle spasms, fatigue and a general feeling of unwellness at times.\u00a0\u00a0My GP said I have gastritis and perscribed Pepcid as well as an NSAID for any pain.A few years ago I had been diagnosed with benign PVC's.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had migraines with visual disturbances, vertigo and ringing in one ear.\u00a0\u00a0I have also experienced lightheadedness and cravings for candy numerous times in the past after begining to excercise.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that I have Hypoglycemia based on these symptoms and might this also explain some of the other symptoms I have been struggling with for the past 10 months?\u00a0\u00a0If so, what additional tests should I ask my GP for?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance for your help.",
