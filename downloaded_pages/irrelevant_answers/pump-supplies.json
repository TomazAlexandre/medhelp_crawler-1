So this forum is not the appropriate place for individuals to make contact. If you would like to help this individual, please go to the website described in the answer above (the JDRF website) and send a statement to the Online Diabetes Support Team saying that you have supplies for this person in case this person contacts them. But do this only if you are offering the supplies free of charge, for this organization cannot supply contact info for commercial enterprises.",
