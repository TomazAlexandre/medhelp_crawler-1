            "answer": "It depends upon size and location. It does require an anesthesia and then either looking in your bladder and passing a telescope up the ureter (the tube from your kidney to your bladder) and snaring it and pulling it out or bombarding it with shock waves to break it up and then you will pass the fragments over the next few days or weeks.Hope everything works out fine. Might consider getting health insurance. If you are going to be making stones, you will probably need things done several times over a lifetime.S.A.Liroff, M.D.\"This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.

            "answer": "First, let me apologize for not seeing your post earlier.You have laid out your symptoms well. I wonder if you have a stone in your left ureter. That can cause you to have intermittent one sided lower abdominal pains (scrotal/penile, also) as well as the urinary frequency both day and night. Usually there is blood in the urine (often just seen under the microscopic), but not always. You will need an x-ray of your kidneys and bladder (IVP). Prostatitis is another possibility. If you do have a stone, then that needs attention sooner than later as it can cause long term kidney damage.I cannot relate your scrotal itchiness/redness to anything other than a local skin problem: fungal infection, allergic reaction. Using any new soaps or chemicals/deodorants/creams, etc lately?I would get to a urologist as soon as the finances permit.S.A.Liroff, M.D.This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.
