            "answer": "As you probably already know, neuropathy can be a complication of diabetes and it can be painful.\u00a0\u00a0I know that there are some drugs that sometimes help with neuropathy, but I'm not a doctor so i really couldn't recommend anything.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest that you go to neurologist who will help you figure out what your options are to get some relief.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor will also be able to tell you if it is better to use heat or cold to ease the pain.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard different opinions on this one.The good news is that they are doing lots of research on nerve damage and regeneration and hopefully they will come up with some ways to cure or at least minimize the damage from neuropathy.In the meantime, it sounds like you may need to reduce your driving or any other activity that seems to aggravate your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Keeping your blood sugars under control never hurts either and can only help prevent further damage.I really am sorry that you are suffering so much from this awful complication.\u00a0\u00a0I know I haven't been much help, but if anyone out there has any practical advice from their own experience, please share it with us in this forum.Es",

            "answer": "I echo the suggestion to see a neurologist if you haven't recently, or to get a second opinion from a large academic center neurologist.Alternatively, perhaps seek out a consultation from a pain management clinic.\u00a0\u00a0They may be able to help you do other things such as biofeedback to try to reduce or alleviate your pain to a tolerable level.Good luck to you.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over 20 years ago. Years before I was diagnosed I complained about numbness in my legs and feet, I was told I had neuritis and there was nothing that could be done to help me. My neuropathy has progressed up my legs and is now in my fingers.The pain is getting to be unberable, last night I set up in a recliner with heat and vibration untill 4:00 A.M. I had taken 2 Clonazepam and 2 Aleve trying to releave the pain. I did finally get to sleep but the pain is still there this morning.I have noticed when I drive a lot over 2 or 3 days it seems to bring this on stronger.I would appreciate any ideas that might help.Thank you.",
