            "answer": "Please test at 1 1/2 - 2 hours after starting to eat.\u00a0\u00a0That will give us a better idea.\u00a0\u00a0Please also test fasting, if you can.At 4 hours after eating your blood sugar should be back to fasting levels (ie. < 95), so your numbers are a little high. However, 1 test alone cannot draw firm conclusions.Recommend you go to your Dr. and request Hba1c test, after explaining your symptoms.If you are expecting some possible blood sugar issues, it is very important to eat low carb (after all diabetes is a problem with carb metabolism), and to exercise regularly, ideally every day.",

    "question": "I now have been having the constant urge to hydrate, no matter how much water or kool aid I drink it's never enough. The sensation of feeling thirsty is very strong, it almost hurts. It has been occurring on and off since 3am this morning. I've had no pop at all. Been urinating near clear all day. So I know I'm plenty hydrated. Please give me advice. Should I see a doctor? Could it be high/low blood sugar? A glucose issue? I have no idea... I don't know if this helps, but I am almost 20 and female.",
