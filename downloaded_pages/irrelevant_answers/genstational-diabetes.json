            "answer": "I had it with my first had to take the insulin. Everything whent well and he was born late and was a normal baby size. With my second I was not, which is rare as you are discovering. Anyways had a healthy baby girl. Then with my third, well I was a gain. It was not so great. We could not get my blood sugars under control.\u00a0\u00a0I would go hypo and gels. It was dangerous. I could have ended up in a coma. So they induced me a month early, in order to prevent that from happening. Now im expecting again\u00a0\u00a0im having my referal to the diabetes clinic right away. Im scared this time. Im hopeing that thing will be ok. Though im worried about it. Ive alreasy\u00a0\u00a0started my diet.\u00a0\u00a0Salads aand chicken.\u00a0\u00a0Here is a tip that should help. Green veggies are called free bees as they do not affect your blood sugar and so you can eat as much as you want of it. Stay away from breads and fruits like bananas, pinaple, mango they will shoot uour sugars through the roof.",

            "answer": "I didnt have it with my first two but do with this one. Luckily its maintained with diet ( i don't eat sweets or over kill since removal of my gallbladder two years ago) but my baby girl is doing perfectly.\u00a0\u00a0Weight is normal besides the alarms for checking my blood sugar levels its been pretty normal.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor even said i can carry to term instead of the induction a week early.\u00a0\u00a0(Its a precaution so the baby doesnt get too big for birth resulting in c-section.) As long as you follow your doctor's advice you'll do great. For me my due date is important (its my grandmother's birthday and she passed two years a go.) The doctor was willing to hear me out and my wishes together we managed the gestational diabetes well. Best of luck to you. (Btw im 36 weeks today and going strong)",
