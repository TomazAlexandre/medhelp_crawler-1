            "answer": "Hi there, I'm in my final year of medicine so I think I can give some pretty good advise of what's going on with you.All the signs and symptoms you just gave all ads up to diabetes, the frequent urination,thirst and hungger is called polyuria,phagia and dipsia and that's the most common symptom of diabetes. Pale,dizzynes and headaches are caused by low blood sugar.The blured vision,upset stomach and sore kidneys are effects of diabetes cause its a systemic disease it effects all body parts.The best advise I can give you is to seek medical help immediatly!!!! And get tested for it before you have a emergancy.But when you feel dizzy try drinking a glass of coke and see if it makes you feel better. Hope this helped.",
