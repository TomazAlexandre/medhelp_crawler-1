            "answer": "Hi - I have come to find that doctors a lot of times can't find the underlying cause of our health problems. I would also take him to a chiropractor. They do a lot more than just adjustments. I have been sick for 4 years and finally I went to my chiropractor and he is getting me healthy again. Good luck!!",

    "question": "My 4 year old son has been sick, with cough, fever and lower back pain. the doctor felt his lower back and my son told her that it hurt when she pushed on that area. So they took a urine sample thinking that he had a kidney infection.There was no bacteria in his urine but there was bilirubin and ketones. I'm not for sure what the levels were. He has also woken up in the middle of the night a couples of times vomiting. when he hasn't been sick. But before all this i took him to the doctor because he showed some signs of juvinile diabetes . This was about 6 to 7 months ago. He has complained a lot of stomach pains. So when i took him in they tested his urine and it had proteins and ketones. They told me to come back in a week and they would check it again so i did and it had only protein in the urine. So they referred us to a kidney specialist and she said that everything seems to be ok. just maybe watch for kidney stones since they run in the family. So now that this has came along i am really worried, because everything that i have read online states that there should not be any bilirubin in the urine.",
