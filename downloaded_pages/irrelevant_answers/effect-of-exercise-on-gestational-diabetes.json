            "answer": "You obviously need to ask a doctor directly about this concern.\u00a0\u00a0I had GD with DS and always thought all that mattered was what your level was after eating, not how you got there (I did it through diet monitoring).\u00a0\u00a0Are you eating things you are not supposed to because of this effect exercise has? I also found btw that the nurses in the diabetic mama clinic were not the most knowledgeable about stuff--- talk directly to a doctor. Your point seems to make more sense to me (how much exercise do you have to do, btw? is this already explored in medical journals? I remember them telling me to exercise a lot but don't quite remember why).",

            "answer": "Very strange, I agree with you and Emma10. I don't see why you couldn't exercise after your meal, they told me to try and walk after my meals, that is exercise isn't it? Ask your dr. directly! I think you're doing great!",

    "question": "36yo female, 8 months pregnant, diagnosed with gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Found light (5-10 min on treadmill) exercise ~45 minutes post meals results in excellent glucose levels (90s) for 1 hour post meal test.Advised by nurse to move exercise to pre-meals, and now feel terrible, and have 1-hour post meal tests in the 130 range.\u00a0\u00a0Nurse thought the exercise was masking the true numbers.Is there a suggested time period for exercise?\u00a0\u00a0If exercise ~45 minutes after eating was keeping glucose levels down throughout the day, why would that be a concern?\u00a0\u00a0Docs will probably suggest meds to keep glucose down, but how is that any different than using exercise to control the level of glucose?",
