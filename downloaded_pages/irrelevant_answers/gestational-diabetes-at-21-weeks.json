            "answer": "Hello Anand,I'm so sorry to read about your & your wife's unsuccessful pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure it's been an emotional time for you both.We're volunteers here and not medical professionals, so you & your wife do need to work with her doctors for specific guidance.Most of the results you report are beyond anything I know about and I'm sorry that I can't comment on them for you.\u00a0\u00a0If your wife has a tendency toward Type 2, her doctors may recommend that she become more physically active and that she get into the normal weight range.\u00a0\u00a0Many folks with Type 2, or with borderline diabetes, can avoid symptoms by taking those steps.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure if there are ways to avoid Gestational Diabetes, but physicians who specialize in high risk pregnancies should likely be consulted.Good luck.",

            "answer": "From what I have read about gestational diabetes, it is a problem with the body's hormone changes causing insulin resistance while the woman is pregnant. Insulin resistance is made worse by having an excess of fat cells, which are also insulin resistant. So losing a few pounds may help your wife prevent a recurrence of the gestational diabetes condition. It is suggested that a woman maintain excellent glucose control in the first few months of a pregnancy, for this is the time when the baby's cells are developing and the baby is the most vulnerable to damage. Again, at the end of the pregnancy, is another critical time when the mother's glucose levels should be kept as normal as is possible.The best thing your wife can do to prevent problems if she does become pregnant again is to work very closely with her doctor, starting even BEFORE she becomes pregnant, to keep her glucose levels as normal as possible. Now that she knows that gestational diabetes is a danger, she can be tested earlier and hopefully can be treated earlier so she can have\u00a0\u00a0a healthy pregnancy.I am a diabetic, and I have two healthy children. So it is possible to have healthy babies. I wish you and your wife the very best.",
