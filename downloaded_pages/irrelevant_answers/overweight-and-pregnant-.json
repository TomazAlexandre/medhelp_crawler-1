            "answer": "I'm overweight and pregnant, that's all I worried about was health issues for my child. Even though some chances of health issues can increase when being overweight and pregnant. You can defiantly have a healthy pregnancy just like other women. Society makes it worse by saying rude things like \"oh your baby is gonna be huge\" \"aren't you scared you might have to have a c section\" \"i bet you have high blood pressure\" and you'll get dirty stares when u tell someone you're pregnant \"you don't look pregnant\" well duh lol but ignore it you chance are you'll be fine",

            "answer": "Don't stress yourself out hun, it will do more harm than good. Just make healthy choices during your pregnancy, Skinny Cow Ice Creams and Chocolates have been a life saver for me because I have such a big sweet tooth at night. You can use calorie trackers such as MyFitnessPal, which has an app with QR code scanner, to track your nutrition. I'm not saying you have to go on a salad binge or anything,\u00a0\u00a0just be conscious of serving sizes and always go for homemade over store bought or take out. I am slighly overweight and was concerned about gestational diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0but I have tried to make these little changes to my diet and go on short walks every day and am happy to say that I have had a great pregnancy! Only two months left! Talk with your OB about your concerns because although there is risk with being overweight and pregnant, you can make subtle changes that will have a enormous impact on your pregnancy and the well being of your baby\u2661",
