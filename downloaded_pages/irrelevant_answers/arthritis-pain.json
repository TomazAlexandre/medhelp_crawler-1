            "answer": "I suffer with osteoarthrits in most parts of my body.For my feet problems I was advised to get insoles to put into the shoes.This does not cure the problem, but it makes it a little more comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you do not wear tight shoes and that they are comfortable.You can take pain relief like paracetamol and anti inflammatory medications.Just beware of Ibuprofen.\u00a0\u00a0If you have stomach problems make sure you have an stomach pill like Omeprazole, or have one after food.The other problem I encountered with Ibuprofen is swollen legs.I take Celadrin, but haven't felt much relief with that.Some people take Omega 3, cod liver oil, and other lotions and potions.\u00a0\u00a0It is just finding the right one that suits you best.",

            "answer": "I've had insoles for years, and would not be without them. I take Omega 3 also, and buy only really good footware. Tried the cod liver oil, but like you said, you really need to find what is best for you. I've been on Cymbalta since Christmas, but really feel there is not much relief in regards to my feet. My doctor now wants to try me on something new, more for neuropathy. Thanks though, like to hear from others.",
