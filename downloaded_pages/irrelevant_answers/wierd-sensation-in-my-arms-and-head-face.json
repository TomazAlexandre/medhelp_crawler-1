            "answer": "I have no idea what it could be. I just wanted to sy that your being under so much stress from nursing school could be the trigger for this condition to worsen. I am not in the medical field at all and know relatively nothing about the body but if I had to hazard a guess, I would say since it sounds like a chemical occurence, a neurologist may be the best place to start. Any meds you are taking, does anything trigger it like time of day or body position? After a meal? Are you getting enough sleep, proper diet, and exercise? Adding some of this info may help someone else determine what is going on. Good luck.",

            "answer": "It could be peripheral neuropathy, or hormonal related. Have you checked blood glucose, and TSH levels? I have the same thing, but no diabetes or thyroid problems. Doctor still trying to figure it out. My t.p and liver enzymes are a bit high, so I am thinking twrds some autoimmune problem maybe? You should go see a doctor and get some preliminary tets done to rule out major problems.",

            "answer": "Hi hippiechiq,One thing that you might consider is: pernicious anemia. It is an auto-immune disorder, it can take years for all the symptoms to show up. Symptoms like: weakness, fatigue, upset stomach, abnormally rapid hearbeat and/or chest pains, brain fog-where you have difficulty in thinking clearly, breathlessness, headaches-headaches that are there 24/7, numbness and tingling of the arms and legs.I suggest that you check out medical websites like: www.medicineNet.com and www.webmd.com and check out: pernicious anemia and see if this disorder fits you. Also, being a nurse, you have access to alot of medical people...check with them...It is easy to check out with a few blood tests...If pernicious anemia is caught early..it is very treatable..if not caught early..you could have problems that may not be treatable..So if I were you, I would have it checked out..SOON. GOOD LUCK! KEMOSABI...LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU FIND OUT..OK",

    "question": "Hi.... Iam wondering if there is anyone out there who experiences the same type of symptom I am experiencing or if there is anyone who can even tell me what it is.\u00a0\u00a0I am graduating nursing school next week, and I haven't run across this symptom in any of the disease processes I've learned about.\u00a0\u00a0The best way I can describe it is this: You know the feeling when you cut off the circulation in your finger by squeezing it or wrapping a rubber band around it?\u00a0\u00a0OK.... the feeling when you let go or undo the rubber band, and the circulation & feeling return instantly... that is the sensation I get in my arms and head/face throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0It's been happening for a few years now, but it was intermittent, so I never thought much about it.\u00a0\u00a0For the past few months though, it has been happening several times throughout the day, and sometimes 2-3 times, one right after another.\u00a0\u00a0I originally thought it may be cardiovascular and had something to do with circulation, but my BP is good and an EKG I had run came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0I asked my nursing instructor about it today, and she said it could be neurological, so I'm posting here.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if it makes any difference, but a bit of neuro history... my dad has Dystonia.If anyone could help me to find out what is going on, I'd be SO grateful!!!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance!!",
