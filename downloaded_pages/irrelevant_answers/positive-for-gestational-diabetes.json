            "answer": "I don't have any answers for you but I did want to say at least they found it on you. See I passed my one hour glucose test but when my DD was born she was very unresponsive and all she wanted to do was sleep and she wouldn't even eat. They concluded that she had low sugar and that I had gest. diabetes but they didn't pick up on it. So you are lucky, in a sense, that they picked up on yours. I am sure evrything will be fine, I just wanted to share my exp. so you didn't feel tooo bad. Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy.Tiffany",

My diet is 30carbs for breakfast 15 carbs for am snack 60 carbs for lunch 15 carbs for afternoon snack 60 carbs for dinner and 30 carbs for bed time snack. I have to test my blood 1 hour after every meal. The doctor said sometimes they have to change the diet the farther along you get (I am 30 weeks), but so far it is working well fir me. She even gave me a fast food counter (example: Mcdonalds 6 peice chicken nugget and small fry is only 60 carbs, so if I feel I need fast food I do have opions)",

The menu really consist of how many carbs/calories you are allowed per meal. They also told me to walk or swim 30 minutes a day. An example is 1 carb serving is a spice of bread or half of a hamburger or hot dog bun. About 1 cup of fruit is also a serving of carbs. 8oz of skim milk is a carb, or 1/2 cup cooked veggies (carrots, mashed patatoes, corn). 1/2 cup fat free frozen yogart is also a serving of carbs.",

            "answer": "I just had my baby and had gestational diabetes. I ate a bowl of cereal (rice krispies) for breakfast with a piece of toast. OR 2 eggs and toast.\u00a0\u00a0For lunch I usually ate a sandwich with meat and cheese and a few chips. For dinner I ate whatever we made but just one helping. For snacks between meals I ate nuts and cashews. My blood sugar was totally fine using that diet. I only drank tea, water, or diet soda.The only time my blood sugars were high was when I ate out at restaurants. No matter where I ate they were always high and especially high with fast food.Most of the time they do sonos at 35 and 38 weeks to check the babies size because they can grow larger with the extra sugars. Also they do the non stress tests 2 times a week at the very end to check on the baby. My baby was perfect each time and showed no stress. Her blood sugars did drop when she came out and they had me nurse her right away. That didn't help so they gave her some formula and then had me nurse her again and then her sugars leveled out. She was a healthy 8lb 3oz at birth.The best part was the fact that once I started on this diet I didn't gain another pound the rest of the pregnancy. I only ended up gaining 17 lbs the whole pregnancy.",
