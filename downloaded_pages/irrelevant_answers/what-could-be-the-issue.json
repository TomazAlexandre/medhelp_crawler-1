            "answer": "Hi and thanks for your reply. I am on tabs and insulin and i can tell you i feel so much better, exercise...i must admit not so good on, but in saying that i working in a emergency department at my local hospital and spend most of the 8 hours (16 on somedays) non stop, sweat running off me. My dr has said that as i am sweating, i am getting my heart rate up, but i still need to do a walk for at least 30 mins a day. As i work so much ( and shift work too) i do find it hard to get out for that walk. As for diet, i dont drink cola or anything like that, i do drink a lot of water, and if i want a soft drink, i drink coke zero or sprite zero which i ahve been advised is fine. Loads of vegetables, the ones i am not allowed i have in moderation such as potatoes etc. Alot of fruit also, but i am bad with having small meals, i tend to miss a lot of meals, again due to shift work etc. I know i need to make the effort in some areas, but it is just so hard.",

    "question": "I went to my dr today and had aecg done. I am 29 and have high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes insulin and tablet controlled, my blood pressure is pretty good, but even though i take my tabs every day i still seem to be wavering too high. My dr after reading my ecg decided that i need to have a echo done as it appeared that the right side of my heart is enlarged and i am tacychardic. I doe often feel heart palps, and these do not worry me, they actually feel funny, like a flutter. I am just worried that something more sinister maybe going on, my father and 4 of his 5 brother have heart disease, his father died of a heart attack and my father had his first heart attack at 38. I also too have high Cholesterol and they are all on tabs for that as it too affects them all. Can you please give me any advice?Thank youNicole",
