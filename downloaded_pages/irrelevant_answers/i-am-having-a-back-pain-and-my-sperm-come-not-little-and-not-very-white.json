            "answer": "Hi there!Ejaculatory dysfunction can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, I would suggest seeing a primary care physician or a urologist for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",
