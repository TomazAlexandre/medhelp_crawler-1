    "question": "So I went to the doctor today I did my diabetes test. Not a big deal! My doctor checked out my belly everything is right on point! I told her I have been having a lot of pain and a knot on my left side under my boob on my rib cage. She tells me that my muscles are ripping apart and called it a fancy technical term. So everyones muscles stretch apart from top to bottom in your stomach during pregnancy. Mine are doing that but they are also ripping down the middle not just stretching ripping. And she said there's a good chance they won't grow back together after my baby is born! It shouldn't hurt once the baby is born. But for now its very painful! and there's really nothing you can do about it. Just my luck! Lol! Has anyone else had this happen?",
