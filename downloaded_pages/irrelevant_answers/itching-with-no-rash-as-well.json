            "answer": "Hello,The most common cause of itchy skin without any rash is dry skin. The other causes are hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding. Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. You need to undergo tests like blood sugar levels, thyroid function tests,Hb levels and liver and kidney function tests.\u00a0\u00a0If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Me too, me too. Itching all over, no rash...like so many others for the past year. Just completing a 5th session of acupuncture - no change. Done all the treatments like others have - alergist, naturopath, tons of creams - no remedies yet. Many good suggestions for management of the itch, but going to try the Chlorpheniramine Maleate that someone suggested. Look forward to more reports. My 30 yr old daughter has this now. I had been on a Selenium/Vitamin E prostate study for 6 yrs and looking into link to Selenium.",
