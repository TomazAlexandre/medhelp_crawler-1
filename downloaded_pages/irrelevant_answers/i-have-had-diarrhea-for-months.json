            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!What you have is chronic diarrhea since you have had it for last 6 months. Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations (giardia, round worm, amoebiasis), irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc.Maybe you can do a stool test to rule out parasitic cause. HIV too should be looked into and so also lactose intolerance. Lactose intolerance you can check yourself by stopping all dairy products.For others you would need some tests.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
