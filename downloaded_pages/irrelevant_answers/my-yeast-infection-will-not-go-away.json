            "answer": "I also have been plagued with this awful yeast infection for most of my adult life. Just about a year ago, my gyn suggested\u00a0\u00a0that I maybe allergic to something. She suggested I take an allergy test and guest what, I'm allergic to wheat. She also informed me that wheat made my hormones go crazy\u00a0\u00a0and it me have the yeast infections and I had to stop eating foods that contain wheat, At first I thought, how in the world am I going to do that. Well, I started out stop eating breads and when I researched it on the internet, most everything had wheat in it. I rather go without the yeast infection than without wheat. I gave all foods up with wheat and boy do I miss pizza, ice cream, cakes, cookies, pasta, you name it, I miss it,Hope this helps you.",

    "question": "I have a vaginal yeast infection that WILL NOT go away. I am not sexually active. And I do not have hiv or diabetes. I have been treated by quite a few gynecologists. And none of them have been able to help me with this problem. I did some research, and asked around, and found out that I needed to go to an infectious disease doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Infectious disease doctors specialize in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of diseases involving bacterial infection, fungal infection (yeast), and viral infection. I am currently being treated by an infectious disease doctor, and he has me taking 100mg of Itraconazole per day. The name brand for Itraconazole is Sporanox. I still have this yeast infection! The medicine has not helped me yet. Why is this happening? I don't understand why merely taking an antibiotic for a sinus infection caused me to get a yeast infection that I just cannot get rid of? If there are other people that are in the same situation, please respond to my post. I am trying to get some advice and opinions on this because I am SO frustrated. Also, I am currently on a low sugar diet.",
