            "answer": "If it's not monitired closely, it can cause preterm labor, also baby may be born large or have low blood sugar. Avoid sugary and starchy foods,(breads,pasta). It can usually be controlled by diet changes and you will need to check your blood sugar four times a day. I myself was just diagnosed a few weeks ago. It sounds worse than it is. Just stick with a meak plan and it should stay under control.",

            "answer": "The diet actually helps you best if you write down What you eat everytime and you also write down your sugar level with it. You will notice certain food combos raise your sugar more. For instance, I ate a hot dog on a bun and a few fries and my sugar was around 135 after 2hrs..the nutritionist said after 2hrs it should be under 120 so I tried a different combo with the hot dog another time and it was 129. That being said, I know I souldnt havr anything else with the other dog because it raises my sugar.",
