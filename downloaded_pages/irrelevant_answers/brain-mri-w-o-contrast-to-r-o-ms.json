            "answer": "Dear Suzi, welcome to the medhelp forum. Your MRI shows non-specific lesions or foci, less than a centimeter in size in the white matter, which need to be correlated with your clinical presentation. your neurologist needs to evaluate you clinically and if there is an MS suspicion, there are radiological criteria like no. of lesions, their location and size, an diagnostic criteria for MS. there should be a clinical history of previous attacks, CSF examination and MRI findings should substantiate. The other possible conditions mimicking these changes are microvascular ischemic brain changes in hypertension, diabetes and high cholesterol. Certain infective and inflammatory conditions can also account for these changes. Migraine headaches can also have white matter changes on MR. consult a neurologist for evaluation. Wish you all the best.",
