            "answer": "Lucentis is VEGF inhibitor and used for neovascularization (new vessels). Generally NAAION does not cause macular neovascularization and Lucentis would not be helpful. Symptoms of this diease are reduced vision and blind spots in the vision. It may lead to partial atrophy of the optic nerve. Please discuss your question and concern directly with your mother's ophthalologist.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There may be an increased incidence of high blood pressure, vascular disease, smoking, high cholesterol and diabetes in sufferers of NAAION.JCH MD Eye Physician and Surgeon",

            "answer": "Thankyou so much for that advice...however, i have just been advised by a family memebr that i did not give you all the neccessary information! (sorry) heres what ive been corrected with:My nan was firstly diagnosed with age related macular degenerative and recieved the first two injections of lucentis which, like i said earlier, improved her eyesight.After the third injection, her eyesight deteriated and was thendiagnosed with the possible NAAION.She suffers from symptoms of 'cloudiness' with approximatly 25% of her sight left (if that). she sees mostly shadows, some odd colours, and lighting will effect her erratically, making her feel nervous with a toal lack of wellbeing. Is it possible that the lucentis injections are to blame for this?we desperatly need advice on medications!",

            "answer": "Lucentis is used for \"wet\" (or exudative) age related macular degeneraion. It has been a God-send for the treatment of this disease (there are 2 other injections like it). The other optic nerve condition would not be made worse or caused by Lucentis. Both macular degeneration and ANAION are common in older patients. There is no clearly defined treatment for the latter and the biggest effort is to locate an underlying cause.\u00a0\u00a0Both conditions can, and often do, affect both eyes.JCH MD Eye Physician & Surgeon",
