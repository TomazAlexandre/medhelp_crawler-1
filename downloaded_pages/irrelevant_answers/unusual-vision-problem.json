            "answer": "Vision does not vary that much in such a short time normally. One thing we think of is diabetes and ifyou have diabetes in your family or symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, blurred vision, increased thirst or urination you need blood work to rule on diabetes.I sugeest you see an Ophthalologist eye MD. Specifically ask for a post cycloplegic refraction. This is done after the pupil dilates and prevents the RX from being made too strong.Find an eye MD near you at www.aao.orgJCH MD",

    "question": "Hi,I have been using correctional eyeglasses.\u00a0\u00a0Last december, I observed that I always have bad headaches whenever I use my eyeglasses. I went to the opto to have my eyes checked and I was precribed with a -1.00 for the left eye and -1.50 for the right eye with 25 astigmatism.I have been wearing the eyeglasses with the new lens for more than a month ( had my checkup last December 13, 2008).\u00a0\u00a0About 2 weeks ago, I have observed that my left eye seemed blurry.\u00a0\u00a0Last week I have the same headaches that I had last month, most especially if i wear my eyeglasses.\u00a0\u00a0Since friday, I opted not to wear it because it feels much better (headaches is milder) when im not wearing one.\u00a0\u00a0I had my eye checkup last saturday and found out that my left eye is now -1.50 with 50 astigmatism, and right eye is -2.00 with 75 astigmatism.\u00a0\u00a0I have read somewhere that usually it takes about 6 months for that change to happen instead of less than a month or so..If thats the case, is it possible that my vision is degrading very fast and that is it possible for me to need to change my lenses monthly? What might be the cause of this?By the way, I am a web developer.\u00a0\u00a0My job requires me to be working on the computer for 8-10 hrs daily.\u00a0\u00a0I am\u00a0\u00a0using an LCD monitor and I've had my lenses coated for UV protection.Thanks!",
