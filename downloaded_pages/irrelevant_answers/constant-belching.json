            "answer": "FYI-my dad had a triple-bypass and his only symptom was burping. He did not have classic chest pain and did not have a heart attack. The burping went away after the bypass surgery. My theory would be that gases from his blood were leaching out of his vessels due to the pressure they were under trying to beat blood thru clogged arteries. He spent a considerable amount of time and money chasing the GI cause. He also had a resumption of burping years later at which point they determined another lesser artery was becoming blocked but it was treated without surgery. Burping went away again.",
