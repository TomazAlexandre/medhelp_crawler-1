            "answer": "Hi tvincent!\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical professional, just a volunteer with a 19 year old daughter who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully, we have not dealt with depression up to this point but depression is not uncommon when dealing with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your son should be seeing a medical professional for both his diabetes and his emotional needs.\u00a0\u00a0You are not a terrible parent.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure that it pains you to see him be inactive.\u00a0\u00a0At 27, your son is an adult and if he isn't taking proper care of himself, perhaps his depression is stopping him from doing what he needs to be doing for himself to be healthy.I hope that you can find support through Medhelp and the many volunteers it takes to run it and the terrific people who share their life experiences with us also.\u00a0\u00a0You know there might be someone out there who is dealing with similar circumstances that you are and can suggest ways to help you deal with this situation.\u00a0\u00a0I also want to steer you to The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF).\u00a0\u00a0You can reach them on their website at www.jdrf.org.\u00a0\u00a0They are a terrific source of support for the whole family.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you'll consider checking out their website and reaching out to them.\u00a0\u00a0Please let us know how everyone is doing & good luck to you.",

            "answer": "TVincent,When you visit the JDRF website, look for the link to the Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST).\u00a0\u00a0There's you'll be able to connect more personally with folks in your area who have gone thru (or are going thru) similar situations.\u00a0\u00a0As GG pointed out, the folks there are very supportive & knowledgeable.Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Your son is lucky to have you in his life.\u00a0\u00a0With the chaos that two alcoholic parents can bring to a child, it's not surprising that this fellow lacks the confidence or competence to face life's challenges and to enjoy it.\u00a0\u00a0With help & support, like what you're offering, he has chance to be and to feel better.",
