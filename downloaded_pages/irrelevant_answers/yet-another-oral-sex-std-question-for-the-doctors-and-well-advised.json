    "question": "I have read a bunch of posts and I know the risks are low and that the biggest concern is probably NGU. I had unprotected oral sex for less than 5 minutes, with an exotic dancer 4 days ago. So far my symptoms are: frequent feeling to urinate, slight tickle/mild ache around glans and urethral opening, slight ball ache. I have had no discharge and no burning sensation beyond normal urine temperature feel. Also, I can ejaculate with comfort as well.I should also mention I have type 2 diabetes and have not been great on my medicine lately (I know)...So, my concern is that my symptoms are more anxiety than real, but just wanted to get some other feedback.",
