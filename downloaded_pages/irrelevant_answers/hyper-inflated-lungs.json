            "answer": "Many people seem to be having longer-lasting colds this winter.\u00a0\u00a0Sinusitis is a condition that can appear as a longer-than-usual cold.\u00a0\u00a0Let your doctor know if you are having yellow or green nasal or postnasal drainage.\u00a0\u00a0Although your lungs sound clear your doctor had you go for a chest x-ray to be sure that you do not have pneumonia.Hyperinflation of the lungs is a sign of emphysema or asthma.\u00a0\u00a0Greater than 95% of hyperinflation is due to either emphysema or asthma.\u00a0\u00a0Shortness of breath is a common complaint with emphysema, but not everyone with emphysema has shortness of breath.\u00a0\u00a0Inhaled bronchodilators can decrease hyperinflation and lessen shortness of breath.While hyperinflation on a chest x-ray may suggest emphysema, it does not specifically determine that it is emphysema.\u00a0\u00a0Pulmonary function tests (PFTs) are the best way to know if the problem is emphysema.\u00a0\u00a0Check with your doctor to be sure that what you are experiencing is a lingering cold and not a flare of emphysema.When you quit smoking 5 years ago you did the most important thing that you can do for yourself.\u00a0\u00a0The hope is that you quit smoking before there was permanent damage to your lungs.\u00a0\u00a0Emphysema progresses 3 times faster in those who continue to smoke compared with those who never smoke again.Any illness, especially an infection, can make diabetes more difficult to control.\u00a0\u00a0This is a time when you should work closely with your doctor and nurse regarding a plan to control of your diabetes better.",
