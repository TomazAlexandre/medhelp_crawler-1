    "question": "I am a 39 year old female who has suffered fro PDR in my right eye for about 5 years after 30 years of Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In the last year or two I also started to develope swelling behind my retina and had two steroid injections which didn't work long term so in December of last year I had a vitrectomy and macular peel.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to have gone well except that now I have a cataract in that eye which they wan't to remove as there is no longer a clear view to the back of my eye.The last two times I went to clinic and they dilated my pupils, my right one 'stuck' and wouldn't dilate.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said that they would unstick it at the same time as the cataract surgery since they need the pupil to be dilated anyway but he couldn't actually tell me how this will be done.\u00a0\u00a0I've told them that they better do the whole thing under GA as I don't want to be hanging around while they mess about!!Please could you tell me what this condition is called and how they will fix it??Many thanksSusie",
