            "answer": "The customary procedure is usually to remove a kidney like that.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps you have some health problem (such as a bleeding disorder) that makes the procedure risky.\u00a0\u00a0Or perhaps your doctor lacks the skill to remove one, of perhaps it is not economically advantageous to him to perform this surgery on you.\u00a0\u00a0You should ask him and see what he says, being nice about it so as to try to get the information without offending him.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not satisfied with his answer, get a copy of your records and take them for a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Some doctors will say they will mail them for you, but just say you aren't sure who you are going to see yet, and you just want to have them on hand when you decide where to go (and/or to make sure they are not misplaced).",

            "answer": "I have had the same issue for 30 years. I have had an almost none functioning kidney with a stage 5 reflux in it since birth but my doctors never wanted to remove it as I was only having an infection now and again. Personally I could cope with the symtoms etc so did not want it removed. For the past year however I have had infection after infection and have been in pain almost everyday. My GP put me on a low dose of antibiotics permanently and even when my GFR reduced from 83 to 59 in 3 months she would not refer me to a urologist. She wrote in my notes after an ultrasound that 'no further action is needed'. I was even getting infections while on the antibiotics so had to take more and more. I was really depressed about it all so on xmas eve I paid \u00a3130 to go private to see a urologist and he said my kidney is probably inflamed all the time and because it is none functioning I will need it removed. I am due to have it taken out in a months time. This is my experience.....if I didn't listen to my body that something was wrong I would still be suffering. I am planning on a family in the next few years so I can't risk having any more infections. Luckily I do not have a reflux in my remaining kidney so it is protected. If you are worrying and suffering from your none functioning kidney then you need to open your mouth. No one is going to look out for you but you. If the kidney is not causing any problems then it is best to just leave it. If your blood pressure and GFR is normal then your remaining kidney is obviously doing a great job. Kidney removal is not an easy surgery and there may be all sorts of complications. If I wasn't in pain I wouldn't be worried :)",

    "question": "I have hydronephrosis of the right kidney; subsequent tests/ultra sound/xray w/radio active dye determined that is is 'dead' with virtually no blood flow and zero contribution to my kidney function.My nephrologist feels that there is no reason to surgically remove this mass.I would feel better (psychologically and, I would think, physically) if it were removed.I am in my late 50s with low blood pressure, totally normal glucose readings, no other health problems and all other blood tests normal (other than BUN/Creat),\u00a0\u00a0I am perhaps 30 lbs above my ideal weight (perhaps several\u00a0\u00a0lbs of that weight is this grossly enlarged kidney....5x the size of the other).Why not remove this 'tumor'?Thank you in advance for your response.",
