            "answer": "unfortunately no, I have a long list of recurring problems since 2004.\u00a0\u00a0What else would cause there to be such a large output if your intake varies daily? I really watched how much I drank yesterday and felt extremely dehydrated; even to the point my lips were cracked and my mouth was dry (literally no saliva).Back in 2004 at age 37, I woke up with horrible left flank pain; frequent urination 40-60 times daily 8-10 times nightly; extreme fatigue \u201cflu \u2013 like feeling\u201d; peripheral edema; my dr did tests...everything from urinalysis, cultures to IVP; to US; nothing was found except severe endometriosis & adenomyosis both female related. This just hit me out of the blue and I had never had any type of pain and no kidney stones were found.Since 2004, my urinalysis and cultures have shown things like WBC Leukocyetes 1-2++, Urobilogen (0.2), Trace Ketones, until a couple of months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I complained in Jan 2011, I was still having symptoms and very frequent urination after all these years so my primary started running tests.My tests showed Epithelial cells 10-20, WBC 2++ (20-40); Tr Ketones and Bacteria \u2013 Moderate, but there was no infection in the cultures they ran. I did a follow up test which showed my protein was still 30 mg/dl so she sent me for a 24 hr urinalysis, which I did yesterday.I've had just about every blood test there is possible and everything is fine except my A1c is .2 higher than it should be. I just had 14 vials drawn Monday from my Rheumatologist to find out if I have anything Auto Immune going on but haven't heard back, so that's probably all clear also.Since 2002, my Creatinine has been 1.0 -1.2 and my BUN 13-20\u00a0\u00a0NKF says my efgr would be 69; one test will be higher then next test lower.my BP used to be 90/60 since childhood or less; until a few months ago when it went to 189/140 for no reason; it's stayed between 130/90 - 189/140 since then. I don't have diabetes (glucose 80) but my father did have diabetes and Lymphoma.",

            "answer": "I'm hoping the tests my Rheumatologist did will help - he said I may have kidney damage and I have signs of Amloydosis [sp] but the CC heart doctor here also mentioned\u00a0\u00a0Amloydosis...it's probably just all in my head since I haven't heard anything after 3 days :P",
