            "answer": "Diabetes is linked to those who suffer from insulin resistance. But there are different forms of PCOS. I do not have cysts and am not insulin risistance either. I am overweight, and had irregular periods along with ok excess facial hair. It is hard for us who have PCOS to get pregnant, but it is not impossible!! Many of the ladies on here have PCOS and have had babies or are pregnant now. A lady named Joy (JoyRenee) has PCOS but has 2 daughters and due to give give this month again. Another lady named Sarah (birdiwebb) is currently pregnant with a natural set of twins, I think about 23 weeks now. So as you can see, we can still have babies!Are you taking metformin? I have been taking it just over a year now and just came off my birth control pills in August 2009 and so far I have had 2 pill free periods. I have also lost about 50 lbs since starting metformin without excirise. You might wanna look into the option of taking Metformin. It should help with irregular periods over time. Metformin can also help improve the number of cysts you have on the ovaries too.",

            "answer": "Cysts are common, but for some leaving them untreated will result in infertility. This has to get checked out by a doctor for best treatment options. I would not really try any home remedies unless you consult a doctor first. Some remedies could make things worst. Also I wanted to point out, all weight goes up and down each day. We bloat around the time of our period which doesn't help. I advise not to check weight everyday (OR if you do) do it the same time and same outfit, so you know your true weight.To:jesska321If your doctor told you there was nothing to do about the cysts, you should have found a second opinon. I went through 3 doctors until I found one that new what I had and helped me. If I had the same attitude, I would have bled to death by now. Sometimes we just have to take our health into our hands and fight until we get the help we need.",

    "question": "Hello! I am 21 years old diagnosed with PCOS 2\u00a0\u00a0months ago as was missing period and undertook a scan. I weigh 50kilo's. So a fairly healthy weight, although I have to be extremely careful what I eat because if I eat unhealthy just for one day my weight can fluctuate. I go between a\u00a0\u00a08 - to 10 womans, australian. I'm now at a 9 so inbetween is ok. Just wondering if this is common in woman with PCOS. I have managable facial hair, bit more than usual I guess but thanks to whoever invented hair removal creams ! I don't have acne problems.. I have 30 cysts on each side is it extremely hard to get pregnant with PCOS??? One more question. I also have hyperhydrosis mainly of my hands is this linked with PCOS ? AND is it linked with diabetes??",
