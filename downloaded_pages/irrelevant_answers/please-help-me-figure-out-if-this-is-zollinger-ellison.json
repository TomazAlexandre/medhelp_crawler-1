            "answer": "hi again, first a lactose intolerance test is done over a three week period (one day a week), as for the nexium, make sure they prscribe 40mg.To speed up the healing process, try taking one tea-spoon of pure honey once every two days, it will rejuvenate the stomach tissue.if the honey is too strong for you then just add 10% of a tea-spoon of bicarbonate soda (baking soda) to the honey.also if you dont want to go through a lactose intolerance test, the easiest way would be to keep clear of all dairy products for atleast three weeks, lastly you were correctly tested for diabetes.",
