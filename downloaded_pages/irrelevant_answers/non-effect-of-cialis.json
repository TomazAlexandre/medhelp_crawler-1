            "answer": "I thought about that prior to actually buying. It was a Canadian Company I purchased from and I was assured that they were genuine tablets and they were in exactly the same type of packing as the ones I got in England. I am pretty sure they are the Real McCoy. And what you must take into account is that the ones I got in England had no effect either. I enquired of a pharmacy in the city local to me and they wanted 60 BGlev for 3 tablets. That is around 28GBP, over 9GBP a tablet. Now at 1 tablet a day that is over 72GBP a week. Not exactly economical.",

            "answer": "I havn't watched porn alone. I have never been much of a voyeur. Here, in Bulgaria, there are porn channels on TV and the gf likes me to watch them with her. I am usually feeling and touching her rather than watching the screen and although I am getting erections they are just not lasting. With regard to masturbation I have done so with great difficulty. The gf has a house in the city close to the village in which I live and she likes to go there for a night, every so often to tend to all the housework, etc. She often telephones me to say she is thinking of me and masturbating. I normally become what I would call semi aroused. A sort of half-hearted erection. On these occasions I have masturbated, or at least attempted to masturbate with the results I have described.I never used to be like this and have been quite a stud. Because the gf asked me how many women I had had sex with I was counting them up for her. I came up with 35 but did not include one night stands and probably because of my age I missed a few. Oh for the days of yore.You mentioned in your draft to me the injection route. I had not heard of this before and would appreciate any information you can supply. The gf is an extremely beautiful woman who is a professional singer and dancer who regularly appears on TV here and performs in hotels, restaurants and clubs. I know that many men are jealous of me and fear that unless I do improve my performance I will lose the girl. I need all the help I can get.",

Whilst I am not in the condition I was in my prime I am very active and the gf was attracted to me because of this. She was astounded when I revealed my age to her as she thought I was in my late fifties.",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with diabetes in Feb 2010. I had consulted my doctor about what turned out to be a bladder infection and had to give a urine sample. This is when I found out. I had not experienced any of the symptoms associated with diabetes and was perhaps lucky that it was caught in the extremely early stages. I had not even considered testosterone levels and I will investigate this.I am not obese and at 5'10'' I weigh in at 12.5 stone (175lbs). The gf is constantly saying how much she likes my body which makes me feel very happy in that respect. If I was to lose 7lbs. it would not be amiss.Thanks for the information on Caverject I will investigate this and let you know the results.",

I have found that an extremely high proportion of of men with grade 2 diabetes have a low testosterone level which can cause ED. Also, it appears, cialis and viagara have little or no effect in these cases. You may have cracked my problem. I am consulting my doctor today regarding this. I'll let you know the results of the tests I will undoubtedly have to take. Thanks for all your help and kindly reassurances.",

    "question": "I am a 74yrs. old man with Grade 2 Diabetes suffering from ED. I now live in Bulgaria but was prescribed, by my doctor in England, cialis tablets. He prescribed 5mg tablets telling me to take one daily at as near as possible the same time. I did not start taking the tablets until I got to Bulgaria, where I had managed to get myself a 34yrs. old gf. I did not find the tablets did a lot for me and consequently bought 270 10mg tablets on the internet and received, also, 10 viagara. I have been taking the new tablets and have tried the viagara but still have a problem. An erection, if obtained, just doesn't last. It is most embarrasing and whilst the gf has been very understanding I fear I shall lose her. Has anybody had similar problems and have they managed to overcome them?",
