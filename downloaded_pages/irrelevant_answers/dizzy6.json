            "answer": "A rather unspecific complaint.Once past 30 years old, maybe a bit older, I found sudden changes in physical activity could cause brief dizziness.What is your general physical health, life style?\u00a0\u00a0I think the answer to the dizziness is in the answer to that question.For starters get up slowley, sit on the edge of the bed and stretch you arms and rotate you head/neck... some simple sitting position warm up. Then get up.Loss of balance is a common problem as the years go by. If you are active in activities that require balance, skiing, ice skating, bike riding, hiking on rough ground... you should be able to maintain a good sense of balance - it has to operate at the subconscious level.s\u00a0\u00a0If you don't engage in these activites (one or more or similar) then you may want to try some simple balance exercise as part of your getting up.\u00a0\u00a0Standing on one leg - okay to hold on to the door frame to start, then stand on the other leg, then rotate the free leg, even do with your eyes closed.\u00a0\u00a0You have to work up to harder levels as you accomplish the simpler ones.I'm just a patient, not a doctor, but there is noting in the simple description that makes me think ears-nose-throat specific health issues.",

            "answer": "There are many things that can contribute to dizziness upon standing.Blood pressure issues, vertigo ( inner ear disturbance ), diabetes, a nerve that was pinched during sleep, ( especially in the neck ) ...and the list goes on.As Jerry suggested, without more info ( symptoms to go by ) it's hard to figure it out.If this is continuous and bothersome you should see a doctor to rule out anything serious.",
