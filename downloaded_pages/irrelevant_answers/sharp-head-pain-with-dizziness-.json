    "question": "For a while now I have been getting very dizzy when I go from a sitting to standing position and also when I get the dizzy feeling I also get a\u00a0\u00a0very sharp pain that last a few seconds. The pain is so intense that I often have to hold on to something and wait for it all to pass. When this all started it would only happen every now and then, But now it's almost every time I stand up. I've asked a couple of Doctor's about this and they don't seem to know why I'm having them. If anyone has any suggestions I would greatly appreciate it. Thanx",
