You also could check in the county where you live and ask for a social worker to see if they have some ideas for you.\u00a0\u00a0This is why Obama needs to keep pounding away at fixing the health insurance problem.\u00a0\u00a0Write to your congressman.",

    "question": "I just found out that I have two large hard nodules-1=4.3cm\u00a0\u00a0and 1=1.5cm. Had ultrasound but cannot find a specialist that will see me as I have no insurance. Lost COBRA after an administrator lied and said they did not receive payment. I am terrified as I have been reading that the larger the mass the more likely it is I have cancer. I was diagnosed with diabetes the same day. I have felt ill for a long time but could not afford to seek care after I lost my job and insurance. The community clinic I went to said to see someone within 2 weeks as this was serious. The bloodwork they did has not come back yet but after that, they let me know I was on my own.All I have left is my condo and car. I have lost everything including my good credit and I understand that to apply for help through our county, they will take your home for the medical bill.Can anyone offer advice about where to get treated where they would bill me and let me pay on time and also, is it true that these large nodules are usually cancer and what I can expect for treatment and expenses? I am still not working and have submitted over 100 resumes with not even one call for an interview. I have lost my energy and frankly my hope.Thank you for any help.",
