    "question": "I am loosing my hair due to diabetes. I think this is a common problem for diabetics. The top of my head is where it is getting thin. It has got to the point where I find large number of hairs coming out each time I comb or wash my hair. This is so upsetting and frustrating. I\u2019m seeing a doctor at Seager medical group tomorrow, a hair restoration clinic in Canada. I hope he can offer up some solution for my trouble. Please share if anyone else is facing the same problem.",
