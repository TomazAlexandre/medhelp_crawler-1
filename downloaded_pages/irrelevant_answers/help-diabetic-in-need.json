            "answer": "Hi helpinneed,Good for you for being ready to make the effort. I'm no expert, just the mom of a teenage diabetic (who, thankfully, was born to love routines), but I used to be a journalist covering health, fitness, weight, etc., and I've interviewed every expert out there. My take on what they would say is: One step at a time. It is unreasonable and overwhelming for you to suddenly hew to a meticulous routine, so don't get overly ambitious. I would suggest picking one chore to start with, and just do that for one week straight-- perhaps test yourself when you wake up in the morning. After you do that for a week (or two) consistently, add one more thing-- perhaps test yourself before dinner. Don't add a new routine until the last one you added is internalized. If it takes a long time, that's better than setting overly ambitious goals and feeling like a failure. If, after six months, you can get in the routine of testing 5 or 6 times a day, getting some moderate exercise, and giving yourself the appropriate insulin, you should really notice the difference.Also, have you considered a pump? Do you have one? My daughter thusfar refuses to (but she's doing fine without it), but I know many people who say it's made their life much easier.Good luck, don't get overwhelmed, and just focus on one small step at a time. You can and will succeed!",
