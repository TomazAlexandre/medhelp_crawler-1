            "answer": "Your limited post leaves a lot to assume. Please answer the following so we can assist you better. Don't be a AFTR.1. Did you use a home glucose meter to arrive at 400?2. Was it calibrated?3. Was this Preprandial (before meal)?4. Was this Postprandial\u00a0\u00a0(after meal)?5. How often do you test and when?You can help yourself by not consuming sugary foods or food containing bad carbs. If you don't know what these are then do a Google search. Moderate exercise also helps to reduce glucose levels. If you continue to ignore your diet/nutrition/exercise then diabetic complications will be in your future, if not immediate future.Your doctor is probably looking to see if you're helping yourself by controlling your diabetes or not. Thus, the week delay in the appointment to see what your glucose level is a week from now.",

            "answer": "Hi Michael:Any type of illness will cause your blood sugar to go out of control.\u00a0\u00a0So the fact that you have a \"bad cold\" is probably the cause.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, a high blood sugar should be a cause for concern especially if the cold is causing you to not be able to eat or drink fluids.\u00a0\u00a0If you get dehydrated, it will cause your blood sugar to go up even higher.So make sure that you're having plenty of fluids and do NOT skip meals when your blood sugar is high.To prevent dehydration during an illness, have BEEF BROTH (not chicken but beef).\u00a0\u00a0It has the right amount of sodium and will prevent dehydration.Sometimes doctors are not concerned when a diabetic's blood sugar goes up when the diabetic usually has high levels.\u00a0\u00a0For example, when my mother was diagnosed as a diabetic, her blood sugar was over 1000 and she was alert and could walk.\u00a0\u00a0You see, my mother must have been a diabetic for a very long time and didn't know it.\u00a0\u00a0So her blood sugar slowly climbed up and her body was used to always having a very high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetics can get used to having high blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0That's why sometimes you hear diabetics say their blood sugar is in the hundreds and they feel fine.Since it sounds like you keep your diabetes under good control, I would suggest calling your doctor if your blood sugar remains at 400 and asking him if he would like you to take some extra diabetes medication while it's high.",
