            "answer": "I think that is a great question.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a doctor, but have had diabetes for 39 years so I am only speaking from experience.\u00a0\u00a0Theoretically, if you are in good control and not eating more than your body needs, in terms of your metabolism and your activity level, then you should maintain the same weight. Weight gain may occur for all the same reasons that people without diabetes gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0They eat more food than they need.\u00a0\u00a0They can still be in good control as long as they take enough insulin to keep theri blood sugars within a healthy range.When your blood sugars are out of control, your body is not able to use all the food you may be eating and the excess sugar gets spilled into your blood stream. You may lose weight even though you are eating normally or even more than normally. Once you get your sugars under control, your body is more efficient in converting what it needs and using every calorie, so there may be some initial weight gain after\u00a0\u00a0being diagnosed and treated.If you have a lot of lows, you may have the tendency to eat a little more to avoid those awful lows.\u00a0\u00a0This can also cause some weight gain over time. Reducing your insulin may work to avoid lows, but for some people, the high and low swings are much harder to manage. Diabetes is a difficult disease to manage in this respect.\u00a0\u00a0Finding the right balnce between, food, activity and insulin is very difficult for many diabetics.I think that weight management for everyone is a challenge, but for diabetics, there are just many more factors that have to be considered.I'm not sure thatI have given you a very clear answer, but I can tell you that I know many healthy diabetics who are in good control and maintain excellent weight control.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, they do all the things that everyone else does who is able to maintain their weight, plus a little more.Es",

            "answer": "I think that ES hit the nail on the head.I can see this scenario ... Assume a person were eating 2000 calories a day and running high BGs because s/he didn't get the right balance of insulin, calories, exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Those high BGs mean that some portion of those calories were, in essence, pee'd out.\u00a0\u00a0Let's assume it's 200 calories a day that were eaten and not available to the body for fuel or for storage.Somehow new information or new motivation leads the person to do all the hard work to get that balance worked out and they still enjoy 2000 calories a day.\u00a0\u00a0NOW, all those calories are available for fuel or for storage.\u00a0\u00a0If the person exercises, then the calories are consumed for fuel.\u00a0\u00a0If the person doesn't, then the calories are stored -- at the rate of 200 calories per day, every day.\u00a0\u00a0Gradually the calories will build, and for every 3500 extra calories stores -- the person will gain one pound.So, the \"fuel in\" vs \"fuel out\" math will prevail once we get our BGs in line.\u00a0\u00a0One tragedy is a manipulation used by some adolescents & teens, who attempt to use high BG in order to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0This is a deadly strategy akin to bulemia & anorexia.Hope the big picture on why some folks do gain weight is helpful.\u00a0\u00a0There is no reason why we have to gain weight.\u00a0\u00a0We can, in fact, enjoy healthy BGs and also healthy weight for decades and decades.",

    "question": "I have heard that once you have good control of your Blood Sugar levels, you gain weight?This is very confusing. I know that sugar is no longer being spilled into the blood stream, but shouldnt this be the total opposite? If you have too much insulin, yes,\u00a0\u00a0but what if you have good control of it along w/ diet and exercise?",
