            "answer": "it took good few months of drinking it 2 to 3 times a day, my heart rate went to 45's and 48's, it was the only thing i had added in my diet and lifestyle apart form some exercise and weight loss, i only took it as i heard it helps you relax and fights stomach ulcers, the side effect from it may benefit many people if this is true,i only noticed the low heart rate at a routine checkup, the nurse asked me if i had diabetes as it was in the 40s. my mother said what if its the herbal tea, i argued no way, but then i remembered its a muslce relaxant, i stopped it my heart rate increased in over 2 weeks and now constantly at 67 my normal rate was in the late 70's and early 80s.im not sure if its the tea, but honestly from the tiome of starting it my heart rate decreased, stopping the tea, it increased slightly, it must be relaxing the heart muslce just like other muscles. Maybe it would be dangrous for people on medications to lower the heart rate as it may react.",
