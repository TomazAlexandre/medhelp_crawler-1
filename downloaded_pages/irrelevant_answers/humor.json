            "answer": "I have to laugh at myself... and am very open with others in regards to my mental issues. Don't hide it well anyway, poker face has never been a talent of mine. Laughing is the best medicine. (if you can muster it up). I don't get too defensive when others poke fun... more so when they don't take it seriously. THAT is frustrating and does make it difficult to fnd humor in my situation. I always say, \"self-deprecating humor is only funny when I use it\".: )don't stop laughing. Doesn't mean you don't take it seriously and others I think poke fun at you because they are uncomfortable and probably don't know how else to deal with it. That helpless feeling of not being able to help is frustrating to loved ones and friends and they can't relate either... empathy is lacking when they don't have the 'pleasure' of experience mental illness.",

            "answer": "Being able to laugh is one of the keys to good health. I like to think about Patch Adams using humor for healing. It is true, people who are able to laugh are able to heal. Just because something is serious doesn't mean there isn't any humor in it. If we can't laugh at ourselves then we're in serious trouble, that's my philosophy.I don't mind people making jokes or whatever, but if it is meant to be mean spirited that's a different story. There is a big difference between trying to be funny and tryin to be hurtful.",

            "answer": "Well, in my comic about diabetes someone left me a message critisizing me about doing a comic about something that isn't funny. They said diabetes is hell and it isn't funny at all and if I don't have diabetes I shouldn't talk about it. Well, I don't have diabetes, but I've watched my dad ruin himself with his diabetes and now he has all the complications. I've seen my step-brother go from having lows to the point he was in an accident to an insulin pump and doing extreemly well. I see people every day in our office and hundreds of different stories. I have seen a guy who has diabetes and HIV and double leg amputations and he is one of the most upbeat and awesome people with an amazing sense of humor.So I told the person all of this and I say, the #1 reason people fail is because they lose their humor and give up. As long as you can laugh you can make it. I write my comic to be inspirational, educational, and funny. To point out all the funny things that are considered serious. There is even evidance that laughter lowers your blood glucose and blood pressure, so it is good for everyone.Just because something is serious doesn't mean we can't laugh about it. I think all of us with chronic illnesses really need that.",

            "answer": "Well it all depends. How we joke amongst each other is one thing and it does make sense. My lack of ability to understand humor and enjoy life (at times) is of concern to me and I discuss it with my psychiatrist but it may very well be neurological in origin. I do like the days when I can enjoy life. One thing that's essential for everyone is how we joke about ourselves with others. Before recovery I used to joke that I was \"crazy\" and that's how I ended up being refered to in a derogatory way by other people who didn't have a disability. Humor of any kind is good during depressive times. But its essential that we respect who we are and if we joke about ourselves to people without a disability that its not is a self defacing manner. I know some people in the disability rights community that do joke about their disabilities but its a way to gain self respect and have other people not pity us which is the worst thing. Enjoying life and self respect are the best thing and humor can be one way to achieve that. Just my take..",

I am not ashamed to be bi-polar, I am ashamed of some of the things I did while untreated or during manic phases, but being bi-polar also offers you the ability to laugh at yourself. Its a disease that you have to learn to live with, but it doesnt have to run your life.\u00a0\u00a0If someone cannot accept your sense of humour, screw 'em, there are many people out there that can appreciate your humour, those others who do not accept it are toxic to you, so best remove them from your circle of acquaintenances.",
