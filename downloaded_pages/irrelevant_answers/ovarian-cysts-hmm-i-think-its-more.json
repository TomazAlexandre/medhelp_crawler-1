    "question": "OK I was diagnosed with ovarian cysts in '08. since then I've been on birth-control to contain the issue and even had a surgery for it. but also I have been getting painful lumps on my underarms, back of the neck, and thigh areas. they hurt to touch, making movement in the areas is very painful, and they are irritating. now everything I've read on cysts said that they are painless. I have spoken to my doctors and they have attributed it to the ovarian cyst problem or one doctor said \"some people are just cystic people. nothing to worry about.\" Now I know cysts are an irritated hair follicle, and these areas are around hair...but these things come like clockwork every few days or weeks, I can't center them around my period because that's not when they come. I wonder if its stress related but I can't pinpoint that either. they're very uncomfortable...and they make like difficult. If these are happening thanks to there location in proximity to my hair then I don't know how to fix the issue. I try to keep these areas clean and hygienic. I also had a pilonadal cyst a few times and had one removed once. Now, I don't know if its related but other symptoms are that I tire easily, have an insatiable appetite and my digestion isn't the best. My mother (mothers always have outrageous ideas when it comes to they're kids I guess) thinks its a tapeworm. but I haven't lost any weight. in fact I'm a little over weight for my height/age group. 20 years old, 5'3 and 170. Could I be over thinking this? or is there a bigger outlaying problem My doctors aren't catching?",
