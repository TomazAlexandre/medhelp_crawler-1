            "answer": "I took Clozaril for a while but honestly I couldn't tolerate it although some people can. It can cause blood dyscreias and requires a weekly bloodtest, has a strong potential to cause diabetes and weight gain and is extremely sedating among multiple other side effects. It is generally prescribed by psychiatrists when a person cannot tolerate all known antipsychotics or has developed tardive dyskinesia as its the only known antipsychotic that can't cause or worsen it.",
