            "answer": "I went to urgent care yesterday because I was dizzy and very tired and this happens after I eat as well as shortness of breath and a tight chest.\u00a0\u00a0So I have to go back to have my glucose tested and to get my chest tested.Then the doctor said maybe this is all stress related and suggested I look into anti-depressants.\u00a0\u00a0That kind of pissed me off because I fee like they haven't done enough tests to just decide it's best to medicate me.He did tell me I didn't have kidney stones so now I don't know what was causing my pelvic pain.I guess I have to think about what to do...My body temp is low also, I have been checking it in case I was getting an infection and it's normally around 97.5 also, that is what it was on Wed.",

    "question": "Frequent Urination, tired.I am 26 (F) I have had indigestion and bowel problems for so long...I am currently taking Prilosec twice a day and have been for three months to help with the indigestion.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone to the doctors so many times and everything comes back normal.\u00a0\u00a0I went in for the bowel problems and did stool samples which came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0I just went in on Monday because I had severe stomach pain just above my grion that when it happens makes me have to pee really bad and it hurts like crazy.\u00a0\u00a0I think that make have been kidney stones, but the doctor only did a pap to make sure it wasn't ovarian cysts and told me to follow up on a colonoscopy I should have.In addition I have been feeling dizzy (and also like I am in a fog) and nauseous with suddent fatigue for a few weeks and sudden urge to pee (and when I do 20 minutes later I have to pee again and still a lot).\u00a0\u00a0I also get dry and watery eyes (but I did have lasik a few years ago).\u00a0\u00a0Then I also feel very thirsty and my lips feel dry.The DR on Monday (OBGYN) diagnosed me with IBS, even though the Gastro DR didn't.\u00a0\u00a0Hmmm...So I am scared, I don't know what is wrong with me and I don't like feeling this way...every test I do just comes back normal.Anyone have similar symptoms?Thanks!",
