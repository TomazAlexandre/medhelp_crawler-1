            "answer": "Hi,has your doctor only tested TSH?\u00a0\u00a0TSH is not a good indicator of thyroid function.\u00a0\u00a0You need to have FT3 and FT4 tested (these are the active thyroid hormones).\u00a0\u00a0If these are low then you may be undermedicated (particularly if you've been reduced from 200 mcg of thyroxine +\u00a0\u00a050 mcg of cytomel, down to 25 mcg only of thyroxine).\u00a0\u00a0Did I understand this right?Blood sugar issues can be made worse by hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Your symptoms could be due to hypothyroid.",

            "answer": "Hello,your doctor should not have reduced your thyroid meds based on TSH only.\u00a0\u00a0In people who have been on thyroid meds long term (as you have), often the TSH stops being a good indicator of thyroid function.To go from 200 mcg Thyroxine + 50 mcg of cytomel down to only 25 mcg of thyroxine is a major change.If your doctor is wrong you are being put in a life threatening situation and you will be feeling worse and worse.You must have FT3 and FT4 tested immediately.\u00a0\u00a0IF these are low you need to get back on your meds at the original doses.\u00a0\u00a0As a general reference FT3 should be in the upper half of the reference range, FT4 should be at least middle of the reference range.Please don't delay on this. Let us know how you go?\u00a0\u00a0If you get very hypo it can take months to recover, even when the drugs are readjusted.\u00a0\u00a0And yes, hypothyroid can create havoc with your blood sugars.Btw my TSH is not detectable and has been that way for quite a few years.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor doesn't even test TSH any more; we only test FT3 and FT4 and adjust based on these.\u00a0\u00a0If you go across to the thyroid forum you will find quite a few people in the same situation.",

    "question": "Recent blood work had everything in good condition except tsh was .09 . Cholesteral/ trigly etc were all 146 or lower ..better than in 15 years.I was exposed to radiation and have had thryoid cancer (removed 1984), bladder and skin cancers.\u00a0\u00a0I was on 200 synthroid in am and 50 cytomel 2 x per day (i took only once a day as I couldnt sleep).\u00a0\u00a0Doc brought my thyroid meds to 25 synthroid only.My body aches, and have had sugar issues already.\u00a0\u00a0Is this in my head?\u00a0\u00a0I went to another doc to be sure and he said deal with it.\u00a0\u00a0a low dose isn't going to kill me but he referred to an endo.\u00a0\u00a0anyway.\u00a0\u00a0They dont want to see me because I don't have insurance.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to run up any bills if I'm just being stupid.ThanksVictoriaThis discussion is related to/posts/show/717945.",
