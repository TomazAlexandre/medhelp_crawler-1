            "answer": "I think you should absolutely go to a healthcare professional with your concerns!That being said, maybe your friend could let you use her sister's monitor to check your blood glucose? If not, then your local pharmacy should have ketone/glucose sticks. You don't need a prescription to purchase them and all you do is (pardon my directness) pee in a cup, quickly dip it in, count 15 seconds, and compare the color of the swatch to the bottle. If you test anything besides negative on either the glucose or the ketones, call your doctor RIGHT AWAY!Either way, I really do suggest you see a doctor and at least voice your concerns to him/her.Best of luck, hope I helped and that everything turns out well for you!M",
