            "answer": "Many things could cause it to happen. The most common reason for a miscarriage is chromosomal defects. Miscarriages happen in about 1 of 4 pregnancies (most of the time before the woman even knows she is pregnant). I know how hard this must be for you. I had a miscarriage at 9 weeks that was only detected by an ultrasound but I got pregnant again 6 weeks later and now have a darling little girl. So things can get better. **Hugs**",
