            "answer": "Hi,If you are having erections and have got nocturnal emissions, I can safely assume that the problem is not grave enough. I\u2019ll suggest you not worry about not having masturbated or having sex in the past. If you masturbate, then your nocturnal emissions will also decrease. I don\u2019t think your semen is mixed with urine in nocturnal emissions. It could simply be a case of a large amount of semen with a lot fluid content and looking like being mixed with urine. If you are passing urine too often and have to get up at night daily, will suggest you to rule out diabetes mellitus and diabetes inspidus by consulting a physician.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Kind regards.",

    "question": "I am a 26 year old male who has never had sex for religious reasons.\u00a0\u00a0Although I have erections, I have never masturbated because I never felt like I needed to.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, however, I've realized that most people, Christian or otherwise, feel the need to do this and do it.\u00a0\u00a0Much to my chagrin, I am physically unable to masturbate!\u00a0\u00a0My penis doesn't even feel very sensitive when I have erections, and it was surprising to me when I heard others say that it is supposed to be.\u00a0\u00a0I have nocturnal emissions, but very rarely, and sometimes, the semen has urine in it.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my glans has a bluish hue.\u00a0\u00a0Another concern, unless I have a specific female I like, I cannot get an erection, not even from looking at pornography or imagining things.\u00a0\u00a0I used to not have any problem with this.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, I pee alot and wake up at least once a night to pee, and a urologist said my urine flow was half as strong as it should be.\u00a0\u00a0I realize this could be due to my Christian upbringing, but I have many friends who had a similar upbringing, and it is all they can do not to masturbate.Anyway, any of these by themselves I could write off, but all of them together have me concerned.",
