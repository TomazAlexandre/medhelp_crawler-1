    "question": "So for a week already I've been having tension headaches, off and on, all the time! I'm 18w3d as of today (and tomorrow I'll be going to my monthly visit to the doctor) and it is driving me crazy! Tylenol doesn't work (bought it, tried it and nothing!). I definitely know it's not due to high blood pressure since mine is ok. It's not diabetes either since you only get headaches when you have diabetes if your sugar is low (which means that if I eat a candy the headache would disappear, but it doesn't) and also I got my blood checked 4 months ago and it was fine too. Plus the \"pain\" is different. This headache is definitely a tension one, I don't know if it was brought cause of the pregnancy hormones or the stress. (btw I posted this on the March 10 babies forum and got good answers from the kind ladies over there but I need more advice :-). So my question is: is this kind of headache normal during the 2nd trimester? if so, what tips do you have to make it disappear?Thank you :-D",
