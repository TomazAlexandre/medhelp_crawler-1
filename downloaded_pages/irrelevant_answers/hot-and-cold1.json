            "answer": "Hi! Underlying infection or inflammation (as in arthritis, IBS etc) in the body can result in the feeling of heat. Another possibility is hyperthyroidism. Antibiotic or other drug metabolism can also cause a feeling of heat in the body. Drink plenty of fluids, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and take multivitamins. Get your thyroid function assessed. Sjogren\u2019s syndrome is another possibility. It can also be due to heart problems, especially if you feel suffocated at night. Menopause is also a known cause so get FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone level assessed.The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Take care!",
