            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It could be persisting yeast infection. Yeast infection or thrush is at times very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks along with local application of antifungal cream. There are many types of antifungals available. Take an OTC antifungal with a combination of two or more anti fungals. Use both oral and local application. At times both partners need to be treated. Test for diabetes and other STDs as presence of either or both can make it difficult to treat the fungal infection. Discuss this with your gynecologist. Take care!",

    "question": "I just had a yeast infection like three weeks ago, and I took that pill that gets rid of it-- but after that I've had this reoccurring pain in my vagina that comes pretty randomly. It's sharp and sometimes itches... do I still have a yeast infection or is this something else? Please help!",
