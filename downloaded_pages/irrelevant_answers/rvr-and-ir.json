            "answer": "diabetes/IR and HCV are not a good combo since they seem to compound each other. However IR would not be expected to have any effect on PIs, which appears to be the case.\u00a0\u00a0See AASLS abstract 805.\"No Impact of Insulin Resistance on Antiviral Efficacy of Telaprevir-based regimen in HCV Genotype 1 Treatment-Naive Patients: Subanalysis of C208 Study \"\"Conclusions: In this retrospective analysis of G1 patients treated with TVR based regimen 1) BL HOMA was not predictive of virologic response; 2) SVR was associated with an improvement of HOMA. These results suggest that metabolic factors and insulin resistance do not have significant impact on treatment efficacy. These results warrant further confirmation. \"so adding a PI may be the best way to address the problem. The results from using insulin sensitizers seem less clear cut, see:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19919569vshttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18555553",

(But, there is no real way to find out anyway)By the way, the reason that I got to UND in two weeks is because I pre-dosed riba and did double peg for the first four weeks of treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Not exactly music to your ears, I expect.",
