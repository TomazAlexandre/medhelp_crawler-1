            "answer": "The following info is from the book \"The Everything Guide To Thyroid Disease\" by Theodore C. Friedman, MD, PhD and Winnie Yu Scherer:\"Although the majority of people with Hashimoto's will not develop any other disorders, it's important to know what some of these autoimmune conditions are in case you do start to experience symptoms. Keep in mind, too, that you may be more likely to develop Hashimoto's if you have one of these other conditions.Type 1 diabetesPernicious AnaemiaAddison's DiseaseVitiligoCeliac DiseaseAlopecia AretaSystematic Lupus Erthematosus (SLE)Rheumatoid ArthritisSjogren's SyndromeInflammatory Bowel DiseaseMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\"",

            "answer": "What are the reference ranges for your T3 and T4?\u00a0\u00a0Ranges vary lab to lab and have to come from your own report.\u00a0\u00a0Also are those Free T3 and Free T4 or are they Total T3 and Total T4?\u00a0\u00a0They aren't the same tests and don't give the same information.\u00a0\u00a0It's not unusual for TSH to be elevated and T3 and T4 in the normal ranges, especially if they are \"low normal\". That's why the ranges are important. It's true that hypothyroidism can cause high cholesterol, but so can other things.Your mother has hyperthyroidism - what level is 25, when it should be 5? What medication does she take?You should ask your doctor to test thyroid antibodies, Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOab) and Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb) to determine if you have Hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease and once a person has one autoimmune, chances are greater that they will get another or more autoimmunes.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, autoimmune diseases tend to run in families, but not every member of the family will get the same autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, I have Hashimoto's and Pernicious Anemia, my son has Type I Diabetes and my daughter has Lupus.Sweating is, typically, a symptom of hyperthyroidism rather than hypo, but it can be caused by other things as well.\u00a0\u00a0I had the pounding heart you describe when I was very hypo; it was usually an anxiety thing.",

            "answer": "The reference range for T3 (Electro Chemiluminiscence assay) is 0.8-2.0T4 is 5.1-14.1. So my T4 is decent at 8.55 and my T3 is 1.10My mother's Hyperthyroidism was taken at 25 when the max normal was 5.You are probably right about the sweating that it's related to anxiety.I looked up Hashimoto's and apart from elevated cholestrol I don't have any other symptoms. No harm in getting a test though.Any advise on dealing with autoimmune diseases in general? Diet etc.",

            "answer": "Do your T3 and T4 say Free anywhere?\u00a0\u00a0If not, they are Total, by default.\u00a0\u00a0Tests for Total T3 and Total T4 are considered obsolete and of little value.\u00a0\u00a0You should ask your doctor to test Free T3 and Free T4 to get a better picture of what's going on.While your T3 and T4 are both in range, they are both \"low normal\".\u00a0\u00a0Your T4 is only at 38% of the range and your T3 is only at 25% of its range.\u00a0\u00a0Typically, most of us feel best with Free T4 at mid range and Free T3 in the upper half to upper third of its range.\u00a0\u00a0Your were tested for Total T4 and Total T3 so most of that will be bound by protein and unavailable for us. It's reasonable to expect your Free T4 and Free T3 to be equally low or possibly even lower in their ranges.I'm still confused about your mother's hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0What was tested at 25 when it should have been only 5?\u00a0\u00a0Was it TSH, T3 or T4?The symptoms of Hashimoto's are those of the resulting hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Typical hypothyroid symptoms include, but aren't limited to weight gain, constipation, fatigue, hair loss, puffines in the face especially around the eyes, joint/muscle aches/pains, etc, plus the high cholesterol.There really isn't anything you can do stop or prevent autoimmune diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, we can all benefit from a healthy diet, including lots of fresh veggies, lean protein, fruits and plenty of exercise.I would advise getting the antibody tests for Hashimoto's because it's progressive in that it continually attacks the thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0As it attacks and destroys thyroid tissue, the thyroid will produce less and less hormones. Eventually, it will produce nothing and you will become permanently hypothyroid and will need replacement thyroid hormones, since you can not live without them.",

    "question": "Hi, I wanted a professional opinion and I really hope you can help me with this.I am 27 years old male. I started getting white patches on my skin last year which was diagnosed as vitiligo. My father and uncle have it too. I was worried but I thought it was genetic.Last week I took a blood and urine test. I was shocked. My cholesterol is high and so is my TSH level.S Cholestrol - 224.8, Triglycerides 207.5, LDL Cholestrol 133.1.\u00a0\u00a0TSH 3rd Gen is 5.18. Urine pH is 8.0T3 was 1.1 and T4 was 8.55 so both in normal range.I read online that Hypothyroidism can cause high cholesterol. I also have skin problem (vitiligo). My mother has hyperthyroidism five times more than the normal accepted range (25 as opposed to 5) and takes medication for it.Moreover I am now thinking about other conditions differently too.I sweat a LOT which when evaporates leaves white marks on black shirts(salt?) and my palms and feet are often sweaty. My heart beats harder than most people, (sounds weird) but I am a thin guy and I can feel my heart pumping faster or louder if that makes any sense?",
