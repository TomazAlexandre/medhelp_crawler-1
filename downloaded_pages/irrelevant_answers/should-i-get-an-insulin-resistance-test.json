Since it runs in your family it would be in your best interest to see where you stand. If you test positive, your children should be tested too.To help determine if you're a type 2 diabetes candidate, the following test should be undertaken at your doctors office:1.\tFasting glucose [blood sugar] test2.\tA1c\u00a0\u00a0test3.\tThyroid test4.\tPancreas test, if necessary5.\tLastly, if necessary, an insulin resistant testAs far as exercise, are you able walk without pain? If yes, go walk around your neighborhood for 30 minutes a day. Walking really does help burn of excess glucose. Good luck",

            "answer": "Thank you so much! I've had a recent thyroid (including thyroid antibodies) test and it came back normal, but I realize this is not the whole picture.I'm afraid my doctor is going to think I'm a hypochondriac, mainly because I refuse to believe menopause alone is responsible for my sudden weight gain. On the other hand, I know being a pest when it comes to my health has never steered me wrong. :)\u00a0\u00a0I had to pester both my PCP and my rheumatologist for thyroid tests and a sleep study. They keep telling me it's menopause and there's nothing I can do about it.I can, indeed, walk for 30 minutes (just not very fast), ride my exercise bike, and lift light weights (not more than 3 lbs, though). I got frustrated and haven't kept it up b/c I was riding my bike for an hour a day for two months straight and my weight didn't budge. :/\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I know that's not an excuse to stop. You are allowed to smack my wrist. :DThank again for the advice!",

            "answer": "I'm not going to smack your wrist, not unless you give up trying. I still believe you should get a fasting glucose and an A1c test to ensure you're not a diabetes candidate.From the Mayo Clinic: menopausal women tend to exercise less than other women, which can lead to weight gain. In addition, muscle mass naturally diminishes with age. If you don't do anything to replace the lean muscle you lose, your body composition will shift to more fat and less muscle \u2014 which slows down the rate at which you burn calories. IF YOU CONTINUE TO EAT as you always have, you're likely to gain weight.Try posting on the Weight forums - Weight Loss & Dieting, Weight Loss Alternatives, and last but not least Women's Health. I'm sure there are others who are going thru or have gone thru your weight loss wall and can offer some assistance. And, don't stop exercising. Just because you're not losing weight doesn't mean you have too ignore the rest of your body. Good luck",

    "question": "My father, mother and sister all developed type II diabetes. The three of them have battled obesity most of their lives (my father passed away in 2009 of a number of ailments, mainly COPD).I have had lifelong rheumatoid arthritis. Partly because of that, I had no appetite and didn't eat much for most of my childhood. I never really had much of a weight problem. In my 30s I gained after having two children, and took it off with Weightwatchers.When I hit menopause at age 50 (2009), I suddenly gained about 15 pounds, almost all of it around my waist. I cannot for the life of me get rid of it. My RA limits the amount of strenuous exercise I can do.With such a family history, I wonder if I should be tested for insulin resistance. I would appreciate anyone's thoughts. Thank you!",
