            "answer": "I am not a physician but a volunteer and the\u00a0\u00a0 mom of a type 1 diabetic and the daughter of a type 2 diabetic.You do not say whether your daughter is on shots or the pump. If your daughter is on shots she needs to check and have her shots about the same time everyday otherwise she can go high. for example if she always checks at 7 am and takes her shot and then the next day not test till 9 or 10-\u00a0\u00a0she could go high depending on what type of insulin regimen she is on.\u00a0\u00a0 However is she is on the pump it should not matter, if her basal rate (background insulin rates) is set properly she should be with in her target range.When my daughter was on shots if she wanted to sleep late I would get up test her blood and give her insulin, or she would test eat and g back top bed. That is one reason we switched to the insulin pump so that she did not have to have a regimented lifestyle.I would suggest talking with your doctor and see how much of a time span he says your daughter can go with out check from her normal time.",
