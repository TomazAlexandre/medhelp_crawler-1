            "answer": "Hello,Without examination it is very difficult to confirm anything but it can be due to acanthosis nigricans.It\u00a0\u00a0is a brown to black, poorly defined, velvety hyperpigmentation of the skin found usually in skin folds.It can be confirmed by examination and biopsy of the skin.It is important for such patients to be screened for diabetes.The other possibility is of lichenification of the skin or hyperpigmentation skin.I would suggest an examination by a dermatologist to confirm the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.Kind regards.",

Thanks for your help.",

I was tested and I do not have it. The next time I go back to the doctor I am going to ask about it.",
