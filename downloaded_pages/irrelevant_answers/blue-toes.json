    "question": "For the last 2 years the tips of my big toe and the toe next to it on my left foot turn a very dark blue for what seems like no reason whatsoever.\u00a0\u00a0The foot feels cold on the inside but not on the outside.\u00a0\u00a0The skin hurts and turns very dry looking.\u00a0\u00a0This happens in the summer as well as the winter.\u00a0\u00a0Can you tell me what may be causing this?I do smoke, but I eat as well as I can, more protein than carbs.\u00a0\u00a0I use to workout at a gym but finances have stopped that.I haven't had my numbers checked in about 7 years because it seems like my doctor won't do it unless she's asked to, but the numbers were extremely good at the time.Thank you",
