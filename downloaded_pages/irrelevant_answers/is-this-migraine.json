            "answer": "Hi Louise,How are you? What other tests were done? Dizziness can be caused by a variety of conditions such as eye and ear issues, underlying medical conditions such as anemia, migraines, diabetes, heart conditions or blood pressure changes. Migraines usually respond to rest, avoidance of triggers, and both abortive and preventive medications. If it persists, have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. A referral to an opthalmologist will also help rule out other eye issues that could also be responsible, Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for the update. Dizziness, vertigo, and motion sensitivity are not uncommon in migraine. To diagnose Migraine Associated Vertigo,\u00a0\u00a0it is important to determine whether the dizziness and headaches are independent or related to each other, and in particular, whether they are a manifestation of migraine. Migraine without aura and migraine with aura are said to be the most prevalent forms of migraine and also are the most prevalent types of migraine associated with dizziness and vertigo.\u00a0\u00a0Further evaluation may give more light on the diagnosis. Do keep us posted with your neuro-opthalmologist consult.Take care and best regards.",

    "question": "I have suffered from balance problems for the past 3 years, at first the doctors thought it was inner ear had all the tests even did VRT for 2 years but now they are thinking my symptoms could be due to migraine.Basically i have always had headaches, but more recently i have being having moments of movements/vertigo (not spinning) then followed by a half head of sensitivity/numbness/tingling. Someone said to me this could be MAV migraine associated vertigo which i have never heard of. I just wondered what everyone else thought. I also have days when my eyes seem out of focus for no reason (i have been to opticians nothing wrong). I get up in the morning and my movement seems to make me float if you understand what i mean.Any ideas?Louise",
