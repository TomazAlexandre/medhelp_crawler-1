            "answer": "Good luck! Could be worse for sure. I have to go back and take a 2 hour test on wednesday because my first one came back a little high. They said it was still in the normal range just on the high side. I am assuming because diabetes runs in my family they are just double checking. Hopefully all goes well for you until your baby comes!!",

    "question": "Well I did better on the 3 hour glucose screen today but not perfect. I don't have full gestational diabetes but am glucose intolerant.\u00a0\u00a0So I'll have to incorporate some mild daily exercise and have some diet modification so I don't develop diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Realistically it is what I should be doing anyway as I started this pregnancy over weight. Definitely want to do what's best for me and my sweet baby girl!",
