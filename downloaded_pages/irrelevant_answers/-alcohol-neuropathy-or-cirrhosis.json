            "answer": "It's not likely that alcohol is the problem but simple blood work can tell you a lot. That would be the best place to start.Lab work can assist in the diagnosis of many problems and allow your doctor to know what is going on with you as there are many things it can be. In my opinion cirrhosis or peripheral neuropathy is unlikely but alcohol can effect many other things going on. I would not leave this undiagnosed as it can be something very serious. Please see your doc asap.Randy",
