My Dr told me it can get worse and harder to keep under control the farther u get which for me is true my fasting numbers r always high :( I get a non stress test weekly and an ultra sound to check his size he is currently measuring 6 days ahead :/ which Dr said is normal if numbers rnt kept under control I even stick to a strict diet my dietician gave me :( hopefully u u have it this won't be ur issue and u can control it w diet .. my Dr will also be inducing me at 38 or 39 weeks .. good luck momma",
