            "answer": "It does sound like your daughter could have MD, but there are more things to rule out as well.There are many diseases/ailments that can cause these problems.Without a muscle biopsy and further testing, you won't get any definitive answers.I'm curious as to what the neurologist will have to say, and whether they will do more testing.At this stage, she should be walking up/down stairs just fine.I know some children are a bit slower, but if they feel it's developmental, why aren't they sending her for therapy?My two middle sons both had issues. The older of the two is now 22 and he's been diagnosed with back problems ( curved spine ) which they claim is responsible for his lack of coordination. They told him to go home and play video games...seriously! Now he's lazy, overweight, and has diabetes.All four of my sons are being watched and tested annually for MD, as it runs in our family.",

    "question": "Hello, my daughter is 4 years old.\u00a0\u00a0When she was about 3 years old, we started noticing that she had trouble standing up, running, and especially walking up stairs.\u00a0\u00a0Her primary doctor said it could be developmental issues, but to wait a bit and see if it improves.\u00a0\u00a0She had her hips x-rayed at that time and everything was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Now at 4 years old, she still struggles with standing up without using her hands and going up steps.\u00a0\u00a0We took her to a pediatric orthopedist and everything was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Next, we are taking her to a neurologist.Based on the information I have been reading on MD, she seems to have some form of it.\u00a0\u00a0Any help is appreciated.",
