            "answer": "Hi there!Postural/ orthostatic hypotension could occur due to a few reasons\u00a0\u00a0such as vascular causes, low blood volume, reduced sympathetic tone, a few metabolic/ endocrine related conditions, medication side effect or in a few cases, without a primary cause. Erectile dysfunction may or may not be related to it. Other causes of ED include psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors.\u00a0\u00a0You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, or you have difficulty controlling anxiety; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "I wanted to know if the guy solved this problem.I have the same problem,weak or no erection while standing up, and it could be related to Postural Hypotension.I do have a low cardiac rate,(bradycardia is the name) that could be the cause.But nobody says what the cause is. I underwent cardiac exams,pressure exams,tilt table,etc\u00a0\u00a0I read Postural Hypotension could be caused by a problem in the nervous system called Dysautonomia.The late actres Brittany Murphy suffered from it.His brother has videos on it on youtube.If anyone know how to help me,I\u00b4d like to know!Thanks!This discussion is related to/posts/Urology/Erection-Problems-but-only-when-standing/show/331495.",
