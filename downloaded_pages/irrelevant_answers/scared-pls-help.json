            "answer": "I have type 1 diabetes and if you continue to have high blood sugars it can harm the baby causing birth defects and even death. It is important to monitor yourself and eat as healthy as possible. Walk as much as you can. Are they having you monitor your blood sugars? If it gets worse they may even recommend insulin injections to control the high blood sugars. I too have trouble eating healthy but I have to make a choice for my unborn child. I say get bagged salads and make chicken and make healthy chicken salad or some other meat you might like with greens etc. You can get canned beans and add to veggies and that's healthy. Try to avoid a lot of breads and starches. I know it is hard in this day n age but do it for you and the baby. Good luck.",
