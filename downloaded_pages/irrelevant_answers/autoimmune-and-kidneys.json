            "answer": "Hi blh131.Do you know your eGFR? Or your stage, like stage 3 CKD, perhaps?Since your doctor(s) don't seem to know the cause, why a biopsy has not been done, so a determination can be made?The fluctuating and high crp indicates fluctuating levels of inflammation in your body but it lacks specificity. Do you know the lab ranges?It is not possible to make any specific comments about your conditionwith the information available.Best wishes.Love & LightNiko",
