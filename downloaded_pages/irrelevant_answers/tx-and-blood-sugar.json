I've been able to maintain a healthy diet and am just starting to walk more with the snow melting.I'm going to start testing during the day and see if I can see any trends. I meet with the Dr. again on April 1st and will discuss this with her.",

            "answer": "For diabetics it can go either way.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment can cause the blood sugar to go up or down.\u00a0\u00a0But if the diabetes is not under good control before starting treatment for Hep C, it lowers your chances of success.\u00a0\u00a0Adverse events are also more common on diabetics.I have NEVER seen diabetes go away after treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen the blood sugar improve but diabetes disappear?\u00a0\u00a0Never.CoDigestive Diseases and Sciences Jan 16, 2009Diabetes Mellitus Is Associated with Impaired Response to Antiviral Therapy in Chronic Hepatitis C Infection.Elgouhari HM, Zein CO, Hanouneh I, Feldstein AE, Zein NN.Avera Center for Liver Disease, Transplant Institute, Sanford School of Medicine, University of South Dakota, USA.Insulin resistance may promote hepatic fibrosis in chronic hepatitis C (HCV) and has emerged as a cofactor in failure to achieve sustained viral response (SVR). Aims (1) To assess the association of diabetes mellitus (DM) in HCV patients to the severity of hepatic fibrosis and to the response to antiviral treatment. (2) To assess the safety of pegylated interferon and ribavirin combination therapy (Peg IFN/RBV) in diabetic HCV patients. Methods HCV diabetics (n = 61) were identified. A 2:1 matching control group was used to identify independent factors of advanced fibrosis and treatment failure. Results Compared to HCV non-diabetics, HCV diabetics were more likely to have steatosis (P < 0.0001) and advanced fibrosis (P = 0.003). Patients' age, Caucasian ethnicity, obesity, and histologic activity index were independently associated with advanced fibrosis (P < 0.05). Only 23% of HCV diabetics achieved SVR compared to 46% of HCV non-diabetics (P = 0.003). DM, genotype 1, high baseline viral load, and African-American ethnicity were independently associated with less SVR (P < 0.05). Significant adverse events were more common in HCV diabetics compared to HCV non-diabetics (P = 0.001). Side effects did not increase in patients receiving PEG IFN/RBV and insulin sensitizers. Conclusion: Diabetes was associated with impaired virologic response to PEG IFN/RBV in HCV patients. Adverse events during therapy were more frequent in diabetic compared to non-diabetic HCV patients.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19148751?ordinalpos=10&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_DefaultReportPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum",

            "answer": "These are not scientific terms - just a lay explanation as told to me by the endo doc.-----There's a little more to it.\u00a0\u00a0Consider the hemoglobin A1C test which tells you the average amount of glucose in your blood over time - about 3 months.Normally, glucose attaches to blood cells over the life of a blood cells.\u00a0\u00a0Like a tick on a dog.\u00a0\u00a0When the A1C test is taken there are gobs of glucose on these cells.\u00a0\u00a0The result is a high A1C result.When you are on treatment the ribavirin kills the blood cells at an early age so that they don't mature and accumulate gobs of glucose.\u00a0\u00a0As a result A1C test results may be artifically better during treatment even though you are eating everthing bad in sight.Treatment ends and the riba stops doing its killing thing.\u00a0\u00a0But you keep eating the smores, twinkies and dr. pepper with daily pasta.\u00a0\u00a0Your blood cells again have a long life and the gobs of glucose finds a home on these longer lasting blood cells.\u00a0\u00a0The result, sky high A1C.That's the story I was told by a reasonable doc and I'm stickin to it.\u00a0\u00a0Like glucose on a blood cell.",

            "answer": "FLGuy is absolutely correct.Never rely on an A1C result while treating with ribavirin.If the ribavirin is working and your hemoglobin is lower then your A1C will be artificially low.The more significant the hemolytic anemia the lower the A1C.Rely instead on your glucometer readings and test often. This is very important.Mike",
