    "question": "I had a question..my mom and my sister both have diabetes. I have had test but have never been told I have it. Earlier I went over to my mom's and she was checking her's with those little test strips so I decided to test mine too. It came out to 131...I know normal is below 120...I had just eaten some jelly beans (30 grams of sugar). Do you think these results would be of concern or was it the candy that made it a little higher than usual?",
