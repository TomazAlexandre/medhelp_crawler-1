            "answer": "I think it is time to get a second opinion. I agree that it sounds like the thyroid is involved here.When my levels are off I get hypoglycemia as well.The endo should be looking at the Free T3 and Free T4 more than the TSH. TSH is a pituitary function test. The Free's are the actual active thyroid hormone in the body.Free T4 converts to Free t3 which is the most active thyroid hormone in the body.Being 1 point above the low normal range of Free T4 says that something is wrong!(IN my opinion of course)Keep a close eye on his diabetes as well.\u00a0\u00a0Did you know that most endo's specialize in diabetes and not thyroid disease? They learn it in school, but don't specialize in thyroid in a lot of cases.Keep reading and learning all you can......keep seeking. Don't give up!\u00a0\u00a0:)",

            "answer": "I agree with what Laura said, and I just wanted to throw in my opinion about the usefulness of TSH.\u00a0\u00a0As Laura mentioned, TSH is a pituitary hormone that is affected by many variables.\u00a0\u00a0Although used by most doctors as a diagnostic to determine thyroid state and meds, at best it should be used as an indicator, to be considered along with the more important indicators, which are symptoms and levels of the actual biologically active thyroid hormones, which are FT3 and FT4.\u00a0\u00a0 FT3 is the most important because it is four times as potent as FT4.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors don't normally test for FT3 because they assume that T4 is converting adequately to T3, so that testing is not necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Inview of its importance, why not tests and be sure?In addition, just having a FT4 test result barely within the lower range limit is usually inadequate because the ranges are far too broad.\u00a0\u00a0The ranges for FT3 and FT4 have never been adjusted (like was done for TSH 6 years ago), to exclude suspect hypo and hyper patients.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, many patients with FT3 and FT4 levels in the low end of their ranges report continuing hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Many hypo patients report that they feel best when their FT3 and FT4 levels are in the upper half of their ranges.I think you will find this article to be worthwhile reading.http://www.hormonerestoration.com/Thyroid.htmlIf your doctor is willing to discuss this type information with you and treat your son by testing and adjusting FT3 and FT4 with meds, as required to alleviate symptoms, that is the best approach.\u00a0\u00a0If not, or if the doctor believes TSH is the \"gold standard\" in testing and treating hypothyroidism, then you will have to start looking for a good thyroid doctor.",

            "answer": "I suspect thyroid as well. If you live in the US, here's a site with recommended thyroid doctors state-by-state: http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/I do not know if TSH and FT4 levels are different in children, but I DO know that I have Hashimoto's (hypothyroid) disease and his levels are worse than mine. My TSH was only 2.74 and my FT4 dropped to 0.8. I DEMANDED the antibody tests for Hashimoto's (TGAb and Anti-TPO). That is how we discovered my Hashi, and that my first two endos, WHOM I FIRED, were IDIOTS when they laughed at my TSH.New studies indicate that ANY TSH above 2.0 is indicates hypothyroid if the patient exhibits hypo symptoms. Your son has hypo symptoms. Once again, I do not know the ranges for toddlers, but doctors should be pursuing more thyroid examination, IMHO.Rarely, some children are born with missing thyroid lobes or entire thyroids missing. Has he had an ultrasound?Take action! Get mad when doctors don't produce results or when they laugh and shake their heads! Demand he be tested and treated! You are your child's biggest advocate! He deserves a healthy life! Fight, fight, fight!:) Tamra",

            "answer": "Hello, Thought you'd like to know that my daughter was born without a thyroid gland. She is now nine and doing well. Your son's symptoms most definetely sound like ones of untreated hypothyroidism.Your doctor should also do a radioactive iodine uptake scan as well as an ultrasound to see the gland. You must insist on the freet3 and freet4 blood test as well as the antibodies. Time really is of the essence here. Proper brain and body development depend on the proper amount of thyroid hormone available in his body. If your doctor won't do these test, then find one who will! Trust your instincts and move ahead on this quickly. God Bless!",

Let me give you some background.\u00a0\u00a0I have a 2 1/2 year old boy.\u00a0\u00a0He is going through some health issues that no one seems to know what it is.\u00a0\u00a0He is failure to thrive, not growing or gaining well (I read this is common in hypo for this age).\u00a0\u00a0He has coarse hair, and is cold a lot (for example we were at a store and his teeth were chattering).\u00a0\u00a0He was put in the hospital for RSV when he was 9 months old and they discovered he had a swallow dysfunction (I read this too is a symptom) and the doctor wrote that he had abnormally large fontanels ( another symptom I found),\u00a0\u00a0he is developmentally delayed (i.e. he didn't walk til almost 2, doesn't speak many words, I was told he had low muscle tone).\u00a0\u00a0He has been having high blood sugars but they spike high then come down really quickly (the blood sugars are in the high 200's with some 300's and a couple over 400 but he also has low blood sugars in the 40's.\u00a0\u00a0He had a seizure not long ago we expect may have been a low blood sugar but have no proof.He had a thyroid test when he was in for the RSV at 9 months and the free t4 was 0.69 (range 0.65-2.0) and the TSH was 3.61 (range 0.6-7.1).\u00a0\u00a0Is this normal?He was admitted to the hospital last week for observation and they did a lot of blood work on him.\u00a0\u00a0They followed him for type 1 diabetes and they did a check on growth hormone and redid the thyroid test.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what all the values are but the endo called us saturday and said the free t4 was only 1 point above the low end of normal.\u00a0\u00a0He said he would like to follow him and maybe start him on growth hormone in about a year.\u00a0\u00a0They did a oral glucose tolerance test and it came back abnormal but not diagnostic of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He has so many symptoms of hypothyroid and I read the values changed which would have made his levels abnormal at 9 months old.\u00a0\u00a0Is this correct because the pediatric endo isn't using these values.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it is wise to wait another year.I read that hypothyroid can cause low blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0He had a sugar in the 40's at home and was lethargic.\u00a0\u00a0I also wonder if the hypo could possibly keep diabetes in check so to speak because it tends to lower sugar.\u00a0\u00a0What if we fix they thyroid and his sugars stay high.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any help here.\u00a0\u00a0If you know of any suggestions on what to tell the doctor I would really appreciate it.Stacy",
