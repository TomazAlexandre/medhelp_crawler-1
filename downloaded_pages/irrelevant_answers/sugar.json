    "question": "Blood Sugar Tracker for us diabetic's out there please. It would be an invaluable tool for us to track this VITAL READING. Not only could it be based on those little log books that we all gotta carry around getting all dog eared and full of blood stains as well as getting more expensive to buy , but we could easily make a copy and bring the professional looking and easy to read Chart / Tracker to our Doctors. They could also reflect if we are Type I's or II'sas well as give us our weekly and monthly averages.Thanks for your Trackers , Very Cool !\u00a0\u00a0.... Burrpatch.",
