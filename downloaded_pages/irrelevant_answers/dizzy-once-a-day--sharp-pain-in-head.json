            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!Dizzy spells with pain in the back of neck could be simply due to spondylitis of the cervical spine. An X-ray or MRI can rule this out. Neck exercises, correct posture while sitting, and avoiding pillows while sleeping will help. What all tests have been done? If I had more detailed information, it would be useful in pinpointing the cause. Anemia, postural hypotension, migraine etc too can present with similar symptoms. Needless to say tumors of brain have been ruled out since you say a number of tests have been carried out.Hypothyroidism and diabetes should also be ruled out.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks for your thoughts. I called my cousin and she said it sin't a pain but a feeling like when you swallow too much water and can't get it down fast enough.She has heart problems and her blood pressure has been very high, up to 200/105. She is on more meds and the BP is down.She is 76 and has been fairily active all her life. The docs are mainly looking at her heart.I told her what you said and told her to do my yoga stretch. Lie down and stretch out with arms over her head and legs out and push with her heels.We also have a healing touch lady here that I want her to see. I do yoga and get a therapy massage every two weeks. But my cuz is from the ole school where you listen to your doc. And they are not doing her any good. I todl her to ask about he MRI of her neck and spine.Thanks again, Patsy",
