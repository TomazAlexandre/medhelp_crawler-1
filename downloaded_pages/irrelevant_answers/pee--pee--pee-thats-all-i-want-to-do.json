            "answer": "Hi,The 2 common entities which can cause the increased frequency of micturition are diabetes mellitus and diabetes inspidus. For ruling out the same, I\u2019ll suggest getting the blood sugar done to rule out diabetes and urine specific gravity/osmolality for diagnosing diabetes inspidus. In addition, levels of ADH (anti-diuretic hormone) are measured to rule out central diabetes inspidus. You can get more information from the following website http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diabetes_insipidus. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
