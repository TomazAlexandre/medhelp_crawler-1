            "answer": "Two years ago I had surgery for a double bowel obstruction.\u00a0\u00a0Before my bowel became totally occluded I had symptoms similiar to what you are experiencing.\u00a0\u00a0Like Selma suggests, my obstruction was from scar tissue.\u00a0\u00a0I had not had surgery like you have had, but I was a fighter in my demented youth and took some hard hits that probably caused scar tissue.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, a CAT scan should have picked up a bowel obstruction.\u00a0\u00a0I would agree that you need to see a specialist, and I would move in that direction as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us informed.",

    "question": "Recently I have been experiencing horrendous stomach spasms that come out of nowhere.\u00a0\u00a0I sweat profusely and have projectile vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to a physician who ran a CAT Scan and said he can find nothing wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I do have degenerative disc disease and it gets worse after one of these attacks.\u00a0\u00a0I can feel the pain mostly on my left side from my lungs down through my back, these spasms(?) feel like my intestines are turning over inside me and the pain is horriffic.\u00a0\u00a0Can you give me any idea what may be causing my symptoms and do I need additional test or to see a gastric specialist? I am a 54 yo African American woman with Type II diabetes(2000), HBP,(2006) have had a hysterectomy(2004) and my gall bladder removed(1984).\u00a0\u00a0I currently have a mesh panel in my abdomen due to a hernia after my hysterectomy, and have been diagnosed with asthma and allergies. I also have GERD's that I have had for approx. 25 yrs. although the symptoms I am experiencing are rare and less than 2 years since began.",
