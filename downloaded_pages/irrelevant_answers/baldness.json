            "answer": "So what you are balding.... Let it go. Some of the best looking guys out there have no hair. The plugs and surgeries aren't that great and are VERY costly. Shave your head down and get use to your new look and enjoy it!! It will grow on you and sooner than later you will be very happy with what you have, I mean don't have, haha. Sorry, just teasing but don't be too stressed out over this!! Genetics has a lot to do with it and you can't look at your grandfather's on your mother's side blah blah blah. Means nothing. Don't try to figure it out. :)",

            "answer": "Hello,Androgenic alopecia is a common form of hair loss and typically occurs in M shaped pattern.Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait.Other causes may be use of some drugs,infections and underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. A biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope) of your scalp may be needed to establish the correct diagnosis.Depending on your type of hair loss, treatments are available. If a medicine is causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine and if it is due to infections or systemic disease,then treating it will treat baldness.Medicines which are useful are minoxidil (brand name: Rogaine and is available without a prescription) and finasteride (brand name: Propecia and is available with a prescription).Finally one can resort to hair transplantation also.Hope it helps .Take care and pls do keep us posted in case you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I am a twenty-one year old male who is balding. From my research it looks exactly like androgenic alopecia, which is apparently quite common. My situation seems to be a lot different. Both grandfathers (in their late eighties) have more hair than I do, as does my father. Also, my mother and her sisters as well as my grandmother have absolutely no signs of hair loss. I am not particularly stressed out, and love life. I am not an alcoholic, and am not on any prescription medications. I eat as well as possible. I would love some insight from this forum, as I currently cannot afford a consultation. If it helps, I am a smoker. Thank you!",
