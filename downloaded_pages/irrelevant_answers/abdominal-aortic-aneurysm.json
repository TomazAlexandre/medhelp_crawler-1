            "answer": "Hello,Aneurysm can be a clinical diagnosis but they should always be supported by imaging studies.\u00a0\u00a0The first step is usually abdominal ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0An aneurysm of the heart is something completely different.\u00a0\u00a0If you mother is thought to have one she should have studies to confirm it.Diabetes is actually a continuum and it is possible to be boarderline.Aneurysms can be genetic, but do not have to be.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to control risk factors like hypertension, diabetes, and smoking.\u00a0\u00a0If you are concerned that you may have aneurysm, talk to your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible to see the beating of your aorta or heart if you are thin.I hope this helps answer your questions.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and thanks for posting.",

            "answer": "This is just my opinion as a layman, but it sounds alarming to me. She should get to a cardiologist immediately to get tests run on her abdomen. Yes, if it ruptures, she will die.And, as you said, it CAN be genetic, meaning you also may have it. I suggest you both get checked out ASAP. I don't mean to sound like an alarmist, but it's important!God bless, and I will pray for your mother's health and yours as well.Nick",

            "answer": "i was recently told by the doctor that i have the same thing and i was told that smoking, fast foods and high blood pressure are the worse things for it.i have to be checked with a cat scan and an echocardiogram every 3 months to be a check on it but no other treatment as of yet.they were looking for a lung problem in the cat scan because i was having breathing problems and i quit the job i loved because of it and it was the heart and the lungs were fine and clear. the doctor said that because a cat scan is so high tech they found things that they were not even looking for. he also told me that i have a 2 centimeter tumor on my adrenaline gland and that is why i think i am always tired or maybe its the heart or a combination of both.i also looked up information on both of my problems and it only makes you worse by knowing. your mom will be okay now that they are watching her, the main thing is that she gives up the things that makes it worseworry and stress makes it worse also. good luck and let us know how things go.",

    "question": "My mother has suffered pain in the lower back (thought was a pulled muscle) many times. Just recently she has had abdominal swelling, nausea, rapid heart rate and the sensation of a pulse in the abdomen. The dr believes she may have abdominal aortic aneurysm. Which is an aneurysm in the heart. I've googled it and found that her symptoms matched the symptoms of this and found that is why the dr thinks she has this without any tests being performed. She was considered a \"borderline\" diabetic, but now a days you either are or you aren't.\u00a0\u00a0And she is a smoker. I know the dr is the only one that can say what is wrong and how bad it is.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the internet can be a bad thing, I found that if you have symptoms [bad symptoms like my mom where she can hardly move without being in pain] that the aneurysm could be big and on the verge of rupturing or may have already ruptured.\u00a0\u00a0Her doctor is out of town, but I told her that she may need to go on to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard that if it ruptures she will die. The \"sensation of a pulse in the abdomen\" has me concerned. It says that it can be genetic and I am always making fun of myself because I can put something on my stomach and it will bounce with my heartbeat. Is that what they are talking about. Could I have the same thing? I don't have any of the other symptoms, but that. Thanks for your time",
