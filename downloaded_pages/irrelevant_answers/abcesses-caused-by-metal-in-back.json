            "answer": "Hi!In all probability this is not a reaction to the metal as this would cause wide spread allegic reaction. However, there may be pus or infection of the implants which needs to be ruled out by X-rays.It could also be hidradenitis suppurativa, which presents as recurrent boil-like pus-like discharge abscesses resulting in difficult-to-heal open wounds and scarring. It commonly occurs on apocrine sweat gland-bearing skin such as in the groin, the underarms and under the breasts. It is also known as \u2018acne inversa\u2019. The disease can spread to genitals and hips or can occur solely there. It can also be due to staphylococcal skin infections. Wash skin with antiseptic lotions daily to decrease bacteria. Treatment is by topical antibiotics and steroids. Local antibiotics of erythromycin and Clindamycin group also help. Retenoid group of drugs also help. Wear loose fitting clothes. Get your diabetes status checked as high blood sugar can also cause recurrent boils. Consult a skin specialist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
