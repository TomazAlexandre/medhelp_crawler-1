    "question": "I had excruciatingly dry eyes. Then I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism, keratitus and diabetes (so first check out that you have not got these, because treating these helps).I now have fairly dry eyes which I treat with:1) Three essential oils - evening primrose oil, flax/linseed oil and cod liver oilAND2) a herbal medicine - bio-Pycnogenol (bark of the French maritime pine). This is a new treatment which really works for me - I have halved the amount of carbomer wettening eye drops I use at night. My supplier is Pharma Nord in the UK, who actually sells it for hayfever.",
