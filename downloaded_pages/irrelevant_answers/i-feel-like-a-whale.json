            "answer": "I feel like I've gained a ton for how small I was before. My last appointment a week ago I had gained 29lbs and I'm 33 weeks. My doctor is not concerned and actually said she would like to me gain around 35-40 because I was underweight to start (which I don't agree with) as long as our babies are healthy and its not effecting our blood pressure I'm not going to worry about it. Just more work after baby is born to get it off.",

            "answer": "As long as your blood pressure and everything else has been healthy you should be fine. I put more on this pregnancy 40 lbs but I also had an almost 10 lb baby. I remember one week I gained 6 lbs and my dr gave me crap. I wasn't worried. I just have birth a month ago and my weight is almost off . Breast feeding does wonders :)",

            "answer": "I have gained 62lbs and still have 5 weeks to go. The last 17 lbs have all been in the last month, im afraid it will go even higher still. My dr doesnt seemed concerned though. My blood pressure is perfect, i have gestational diabetes and my blood sugars have been great, and my little girl is actually estimated to be about half a pound smaller than \"normal\" so as long as everything else is going well for you i wouldnt worry!\u00a0\u00a0:)",

    "question": "I can't believe the enormous amount of weight i have put on already. 50 lbs and i have til the end of nov. At a doc appt now and i know she's gonna give me **** for putting on so much. I don't feel like i have gained a lot and i gained almost as much with my first. I'm such a cow. I think it's because of the food we make at work. High carb high sodium diet. Anyone else gained a ton and not worried? I will have no problem taking this weight off after the baby is born. Gonna get back into an exercise routine.",
