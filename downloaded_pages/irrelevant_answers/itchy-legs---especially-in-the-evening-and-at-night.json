            "answer": "Hello,On reading your post carefully,I have a few possibilities in my mind.These are cholinergic urticaria(The exact cause is not known, but some of affected people have an allergy to their own sweat), restless leg syndrome(Itching sensation or burning sensation in the legs esp at bedtime and in sleep), obstructive biliary disease, chronic renal failure, neurodermatitis, diabetes, peripheral nerve damage or emotional stress.I sincerely advise you to consult a physician/dermatologist for these possibilities.A comprehensive profile along with investigations including skin biopsy may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

    "question": "All my life I can recall going to bed, and often having extremely itchy legs; especially around the sides of my knees. When I was younger I would wake up in the middle of the night with such a strong urge to itch that I would sometime use a blade from a pair of scissors to relieve the itching, which often made my legs bleed. Even now, sometimes during the day if I'm out my legs can get so itchy I have to find a bathroom to itch my legs as the feeling is so insatiable.I don't use anything other than my fingernails to itch my legs anymore, but my legs are more itchy than ever. They do itch throughout the day aswell, but more often during the night. Sometimes it gets so bad at night, my partner will literally grab hold of my wrists and not let go until I have fallen asleep. My legs obviously get very dry, and I get little bumps on them all over, which sometimes bleed when I itch too much.I have been to a doctor about this before who has prescribed me with hydrocortisone and steroid creams, neither of which have worked. Also, regardless of whether I moisturise often, use non-bio washing powders, wax, shave or use hair removal creams does it seem to make any difference.My mum has pretty bad thread veins and also varicose veins on her legs, I have some small patches of thread veins, and I think I shall get varicose veins when I'm older so I don't know if that has anything to do with it??Does anyone have any ideas?! Thank you for reading and for any help I get!!",
