            "answer": "Well first off, congrats on losing the weight! I know you said you've had these symptoms before when you had been previously pregnant, though because you seem to really want a child again your mind could be playing tricks on you. The symptoms can be exaggerated in your head to make you think you are pregnant again, though it might just be some virus or stomach bug which can give you the same symptoms. Usually urine tests are very accurate, though if you want tell the doctor you would prefer getting a blood test done. It can take a long while for a healthy couple to conceive, so you have to be patient with your body. good luck!",

    "question": "Hi All,Thanks so much for taking the time to read my post. I will start out by giving you all the basics:I'm 20 years old. (21 in October.)I don't drink, or smoke, or do any kind of drugs. I don't drink coffee either.I'm married, almost a year. Been with the same man for 3 years.I'm a tad overweight, but I've been working on it. (10 lbs down! yay!)Now, for the symptoms:Well, I'm a very Regular girl. Always on time, always 5 days period. April my period was 3 days and LIGHT. May period was 2 weeks late, 3 days, and a little bit heavier. Needless to say, in those 2 weeks I was late, I thought I was pregnant, as did my Husband. We're not actively trying, but condoms before the \"moment\" are the only precaution. The doctor I was assigned to would only do a Urine test, and it came back negative (I had already done a bunch at home). Needless to say, I was broken hearted. Well, along with the late period I was having nausea, headaches, and CRAZY emotion swings. We were planning a move, so I tried to set all the symptoms aside and focus on the move. (Not stressful, at all.) Also during this time, my temperature NEVER ever fell below 99.0F. I'm usually always 98.2. Okay, so weird, but not horrible. Since the beginning of May, I haven't been below 99. It's even reached 102.5 when I wasn't even sick. I've been nauseas, I've been getting heartburn randomly for stupid reasons. It's hardly ever in response to what I eat, I'll wake up and have heartburn. I've also recently acquired a Urinary Tract Infection, which *****. I also have been getting\u00a0\u00a0very light headed and dizzy, and the best way I've found to prevent this is small meals every couple of hours. If I don't, I get sick and they hit me with a vengeance.Now the kicker: I've been pregnant before. A couple years ago, and my symptoms were heartburn, nausea, headaches, and I even got a UTI. I don't want to jump to the conclusion that I'm pregnant because I don't want to be let down... but that's what all the Mom's I know keep saying. Other people have suggested Diabetes or I'm just crazy.Any opinions would be greatly appreciated, as I have a DR's appointment on Friday and would love some new light on the subject. Thanks!!PS. Sorry it's so long, I tried to be thorough.",
