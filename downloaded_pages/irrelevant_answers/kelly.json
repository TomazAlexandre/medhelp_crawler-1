    "question": "Sometimes I feel light headed and starved, my heart races and I feel very uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I get shaky and I need to eat, even though I know I've eaten and should not feel this way.\u00a0\u00a0After I eat sometimes it passes quickly sometimes not as quick.\u00a0\u00a0It's not something that happens all the time but I also wake up quite a few times every night to go the bathroom and do not get good sleep. Also through the day I try to avoid drinking too much because my bladder does not seem to be able to hold much and I'm always running the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0I go through different eating habits sometime I feel like nothing can fill me up I even wake up at night and have crackers by my bed to eat. I had a glucose test years ago and it came back fine, Could I have sugar problems or could this be something else?",
