Your doc might talk to you about the gestational diabetes test that you'll most likely have next visit. I'm 25 weeks and having mine in a week and a half. They also might tell you about transitioning from every month to every two weeks which is happening for me when I reach 28 weeks",

            "answer": "They start checking you around 36 weeks usually. They'll have to do your group b strep test around that time which is similar to a pap smear. Group b strep is a bacteria that is normal in the vagina, but has potential to be harmful to the baby during delivery. If you're positive they'll just put you on IV antibiotics for delivery and it lowers the risk to 1 in 1000. My appointments from 20 weeks until 36 weeks consisted of a urine sample, weight check, BP check, dipper checking the heartbeat, and using a tape measurer on my belly to check how big my uterus was. Between 24 and 28 weeks they should have you do your glucose tolerance test where they check for gestational diabetes.",

No you won't get another pap but you will get a strep b testing which is a good idea to do but after than you can opt out of not getting checked down there.",
