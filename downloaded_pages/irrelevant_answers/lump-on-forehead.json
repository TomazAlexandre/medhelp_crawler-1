            "answer": "Hello,This painless lump on the fore head can be a sebaceous cyst or a benign growth or lipoma. A sebaceous (or epidermoid) cyst is a noncancerous swelling under the skin. It is lined by packed outer skin cells. The cyst itself is filled with oil or dead cells. Under certain conditions such as stress, increased activity, mechanical irritation, diabetes, or other concurrent illness these cysts may enlarge and become somewhat tender. Sebaceous cysts are often the result of swollen hair follicles, or skin trauma.Sebaceous cysts most often disappear on their own and are not dangerous. Occasionally, they may become inflamed and tender. Sometimes sebaceous cysts grow large that they may interfere with your everyday life. When this happens, surgical removal is required.In cases of lipoma, no treatment is usually necessary. but if it is growing and has become painful, then steroid injections and surgical removal are required.If the lump grows in size or becomes painful then pls consult a doctor.Take care and regards.",

So far, my own research points most to sebaceous cyst or growth.It's been happening for half a year. And the good thing is it gets smaller each time it flares up. Is it the same for your husband?",

Today, I experienced a really bad migraine and it has once again resurfaced. Do you have any idea what this is? Should I be worried? It's about the size of a quarter.",
