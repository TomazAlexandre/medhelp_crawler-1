            "answer": "The only thing i would advise is to seek a second opinion from another doctor. Especially since you seem so worried. In the mean time just continue to monitor her. Until she is diagnosed there isn't a whole lot you can do except to balance what foods she eats and her excercise. Good luck to you.",

            "answer": "I am so glad that she is feeling better today.\u00a0\u00a0Since her blood sugars have been inconsistent, you may want to take her to a Pediatric endocrinologist who might do a little more extensive testing. Different tests can tell you more about how her body is tolerating sugar and if there might be some problem.I am also not sure what you are using to test her blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Does someone in the family have diabetes? There may be a problem with the test strips that you are using.\u00a0\u00a0There is also the possibility that she is producing more insulin on some days than others which sometimes happens when people first develop diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I am not a doctor, but I would recommend additional testing just to be on the safe side.Es",
