            "answer": "Hi,Ankle rash could be caused due to various reasons including - dermatitis, dry skin, eczema, heat rash or sweat dermatitis, uncomfortable footwear, etc.It is important to wear lose comfortable footwear and maintain good personal hygiene. Use a powder to avoid sweat collection and apply calamine lotion at the sites of the lesion.You could take oral antihistamine or antiallergic medications for the itching. Apply calamine lotion at the sites.You would probably need antibacterial and antifungal local application medications and a course of antibiotics if the lesion does not resolve.Consult your doctor for a clinical examination. Do get your blood sugar checked too.Let us know about how you are doing and if you have any other doubts.Regards.",

    "question": "I saw a similar question posted previously, but with no Dr. response. I have a rash on my left anlke & dry/peeling skin on my left foot. These 2 conditions have existed for approx 25 years. The ankle rash is not bothersome, but if I happen to scratch it, it will act like a new rash (very itchy). The dryness is mostly constant & covers most of my left foot. Any ideas of the cause of these 2 symptoms? Why only 1 foot & ankle?",
