    "question": "Mine and my mom's cat is diabetic- does anyone know where to get cheap test strips?\u00a0\u00a0Or a cheap glucometer that comes with the sample 10 strips?\u00a0\u00a0I have to do the blood sugar curve every few months on the poor guy (I volunteer to do them to save money at the Vet)--and the test strips are a little over $1 a piece and only come in quantity 50 or 100..and those would expire long before we used all because I only use 4 strips each time I test-- so it's such a waste!Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advanceAnne",
