            "answer": "Hi,What you are experiencing seems\u00a0\u00a0nerve related.Nerve related disorders or injuries usually presents as tingling,burning or shooting. Its localized pattern in the face may also point towards the involvement of the\u00a0\u00a0facial nerve or trigeminal nerve .This has been present for 13 years . Has this progressed lately? What\u00a0\u00a0are the circumstances surounding the progression of this condition (eg any activities, a recent infection, a recent trauma, tooth extraction, medications?).Are you able to close your eyes tightly , raise your eyebrows, smile symmetrically?Are you able to bite well without weakness or difficulties?Are you able to puff your cheeks without difficulty?One significant issue here is what could have caused the numbness to spread.Hypothyroidism, diabetes , vit B12 deficiencies,multiple sclerosis and stroke may present with tingling and numbness.Your scans turned out fine so this seems to be a peripheral problem ( no direct brain involvement).Whether or not this is a localized or systemic disease requires further evaluation.Have you had your blood sugar and thyroid hormone levels checked?Keep us posted.",

    "question": "It has been 13 years; I've had loss of sensation on one side of my face.\u00a0\u00a0It all started out with some tingling on my cheek just below my eye.\u00a0\u00a0That area then loss the sensation and became numb.\u00a0\u00a0Slowly the numbness had spread out to rest of my left side of the face, and part of my left side scalp by the forehead.\u00a0\u00a0Everything is split in perfect half (lips, nose, cheek, chin,around ear and tongue).I don't believe my nerves are damaged, but may be blocked.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime when I message my head or neck, I can feel some strong tingling paulse traveling through my face.\u00a0\u00a0Messaging other parts of the body will work too, except not as strong of the paulse.I've tried CT scan, MRI, Nose & Throat, and Neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0My neurologist's only explanation is that some sort of virus might have attacked my nerve.\u00a0\u00a0I did have some allergy (caused swell and blocked my air intake) before this problem started, but the doctor insist that can not cause the numbness.My older sister has lupus and younger sister has scleosis.\u00a0\u00a0Do they run in the family?\u00a0\u00a0What could cuase me numbness?\u00a0\u00a0Any idea or suggestions!Thanks.",
