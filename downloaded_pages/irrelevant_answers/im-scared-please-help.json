            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum AGAIN!I have written to you earlier too. One big possibility is pinched nerve in the cervical spine region. Neck lymph nodes can be the result of tonsillitis, pharyngitis (infection of upper throat), infection in mouth, caries in tooth, internal ear infection, outer ear infection, eczema, dermatitis, dandruff, breast cancer, fungal infection, other cancers like lymphoma etc. If you had flu like symptoms initially then it could be due to infectious mononucleosis too and this can be very weakening.\u00a0\u00a0Bathroom, wood shop can also be a source of mold spores and this could also have triggered an allergic reaction.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
