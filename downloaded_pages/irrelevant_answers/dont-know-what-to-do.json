            "answer": "Spikes in glucose levels are very hard on the cardio system - going from 487 down to 87 and/or visa versa. Try to see an Endocrinologist ASAP! Is your medical care thru the military? If so, does the base have a staffed Endo? An Endocrinologist specializes in diabetes, thyroid and pancreas disorders. This is the doctor you MUST see. If there isn't one at least try to have the following tests performed until you get a chance to see one:1. Thyroid - thyroid disorders [hypothyroid or hyperthyroid] wreak havoc on glucose levels, among other things. Current medications on the market resolves thyroid issues in many cases.2. C-Peptide test - this is to see how well your pancreas produces insulin.Educate yourself about the thyroid and pancreas. Also, educate yourself about LADA [Latent Autoimmune Disease in Adults] as related to diabetes. This will better prepare you to discuss your situation with the doctor.",

May have to switch and find one that works for you.Are you watching your food intake? Certain foods are a no-no for hypothyroidism. http://tinyurl.com/hypo-dietSame applies to T2 diabetics along with maintaining proper weight and daily physical exercise at least 20 minutes a day.\"my pancreas was rejecting the insulin it produces\"This doesn't make sense. It may be that your pancreas is not producing enough insulin. Don't let this go further.I saw this informative post on how to obtain free health care, supplies, and testing equipment on the T1 forum and am borrowing it to pass on to you. I haven't checked out the links personally so I can't vouch for them.\"Some great resources for locating free and low cost clinics are the two links I have listed below.\u00a0\u00a0These clinics usually require proof of income to be eligible for services (which can include doctor's visits and even lab work).\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019m a Type I who doesn\u2019t have any insurance either and these types of clinics have worked for me\u2014I have received very low cost doctor\u2019s visits and lab work.https://www.pparx.org/FreeClinicFinder.phphttp://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/Both of these links, once you enter your information, will tell you the nearest free and low cost clinics; there usually are several clinics to choose from.The website www.needymeds.com is a great resource for downloading forms to get free or low cost medications.\u00a0\u00a0There are many different companies that provide free insulin and many other types of medications (click on the Brand or Generic name drugs link, then click the first letter of the type of medication you use and it should show up on the list), and there is one company (Abbott\u2014the makers of FreeStyle and Precision Xtra test strips) that will provide a monthly supply of free test strips and lancets (all FreeStyle or Precision Xtra brand, and they also give you one of their FreeStyle or Precision Xtra meters), but you must apply to their patient assistance program as well as Medicaid and provide Abbott with a Medicaid rejection letter.\u00a0\u00a0Here\u2019s the direct link to the Abbott program:http://www.needymeds.org/company_list.taf?_function=name&program_id=1047You will need to have your doctor fill out the forms and provide you with a prescription, and you will also need to provide proof of income.\u00a0\u00a0Receiving medications from pharmaceutical companies such as these can sometimes take at least two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Also remember that doctors and hospitals often provide samples, as well as the health department.I've heard about hospital charity programs that can help with various things as well but don't have any personal experience dealing with them.\u00a0\u00a0You would need to call a hospital's business office or financial aid office and ask about charity care programs.\"",
