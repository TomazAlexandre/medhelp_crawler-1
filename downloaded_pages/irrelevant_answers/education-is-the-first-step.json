    "question": "Hi all, as a professional donating time here, I educate many people on OCD. Education is the first and basic step to knowledge and that helps to make OCD less of a mysterious monster. (Now it can be a known monster, smile). With that in mind, here are a few beginning and super basic OCD articles that anyone can start with and learn about the disorder. There are several experts in the United States that I trust and recommend. First of all is Dr. Fred Penzel, and he has written an amazing book, \"Obsessive Compulsive Disorders: A Complete Guide to Getting Well and Staying Well\" that I HIGHLY recommend reading.Secondly, Dr. Jonathan Grayson, with the super informative book, \"Freedom from Obsessive Compulsive Disorder: A Personalized Recovery Program for Living with Uncertainty\".It's going to take time to educate yourself on this life long disorder, which cannot be cured, but symptoms can be managed as anyone with a chronic condition such as diabetes or asthma does. Here is a good starting article on OCD, and I will follow it with an article on ERP, the only scientifically evidence based treatment for OCD that works, along with optional meds.http://www.wsps.info/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=76:obsessive-compulsive-disorder&catid=36:ocd-and-related-subjects-by-frederick-penzel-phd&Itemid=64http://ocdphiladelphia.com/the-right-treatment-for-ocd/",
