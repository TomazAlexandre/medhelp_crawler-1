It can be a problem with the inadequate circulation (heart...ruled out, or respiratory problem) or low level of oxygen in the blood that is adequately circulated.Hope this helps and thanks for sharing",

            "answer": "I have CHF and end stage renal failure.\u00a0\u00a0The \"gray\" look can be caused by many things.\u00a0\u00a0In my case it was from the toxins in my system building up from the ESRD(end stage renal disease).\u00a0\u00a0What it took to get my pink color back into my face was intense dialysis treatments and a week in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0What it will take to keep the color in my face is dialysis treatments for the rest of my life.Since kidney failure and diabetes go together, I believe it would be proper protocol to check your husband for KF.\u00a0\u00a0Your husband may have an underlying kidney problem that just hasn't been discovered yet, and if not, it still should be ruled out since he is also diabetic.Also, since he has the stents in his heart, I assume he has recently undergone an invasive proceedure, and it takes a huge toll on the patient everytime they do anything with the heart.\u00a0\u00a0It usually takes several months of hard work to get back to feeling better afterwards, and not feeling good can cause the gray look.",
