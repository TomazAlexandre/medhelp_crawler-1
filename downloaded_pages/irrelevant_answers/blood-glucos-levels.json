            "answer": "Thanks for that. I am on 4 insulin shots a day (3 Novorapid before meals and a detemir before bed).Does anyone have a view on the depression issue? I have been prescribed venflaxine hydrochloride (which I know IS more suitable for people with diabetes), but really dont think it will help my control. Thanks for your help. Andrew",

            "answer": "I would definetly seek a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0\u00a0would see about going on a different regin like NPH and Novolog it might give you better control. Especially if you can narrow down your swings. As for the medication , check and see if there are carbohydrates in them by calling the manufactuerer. Mostmeds do and that can also effect the blood sugars.The moodswings will pass.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck",

            "answer": "I want to throw in another opinion here. I know a young Air Force captain who started having hypoglycemic episodes (he was not diabetic) and he wound up seriously depressed and considering suicide after months passed. The final diagnosis was that the hypoglycemia had altered the chemical balance of hormones in the brain, i.e., chemical depression. Chemical depression is a PHYSICAL problem, and if your doctor is right and this is your depression problem, it won't right itself without help, especially while your blood sugar levels are bouncing around as you try to learn how your body reacts to certain foods and insulin.I would encourage you to stop just not taking the depression medications and ask your doctor some specific questions:1. Is there a test he can run that can definitely diagnose chemical depression?2. Are there any side effects of that particular depression drug that would alter your glucose levels?If your depression is just anxiety caused by worry over the glucose levels, then that is a different story entirely. Yes, I can assure you (after 36 years as a type 1 diabetic) that it DOES get easier to regulate the sugar levels as you learn more about your own body's responses. But chemical depression, if present, should be treated and not ignored. Sure, your body's chemical levels MAY even out and right themselves eventually, but why put yourself through the misery?",

    "question": "Hi there,I am a Type 1 and 26 yrs old. I was diagnosed 4 months ago. My insulin pattern has had to be significantly readjusted recently due to the end of the honeymoon phase. I have found this really hard to cope with, as my blood sugar levels have seemed to fluctuate widely for no apparent reason (as does my weight). I have also felt as though I have been on a physiological \"rollercoaster\"..having frequent highs and lows....I am trying my best to eat the right foods, exercise, avoid alcohol, but nothing seems to work. Please tell me that it gets easier?!!My GP also prescribed me anti-depressants as she thinks I am clinically depressed due to the condition. I have not taken them as I figure that I probably shouldnt add more chemical complexity to something that is already screwed up. Do you other Type 1s agree? If so, does anyone have any tips to combat depression in this phase? I am finding it really hard to work.Thanks.Andrew",
