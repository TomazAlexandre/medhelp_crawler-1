    "question": "so at my appt today doc did the strep b test and checked for dilation...now as we were talking before he did this i was asking questions and i had told him i have a feeling the baby is goin to be early. his response\" well honestly you dont seem to be uncomfortable, so i highly doubt that the baby has dropped or that you are dilated any. and by your measurements you are right on track, \" as hes checking my cervix his face goes into utter shock...\"you are dilated to 1 cm and babys head is right there....you wont make it another 2 weeks\".....so i guess we shall see how long i make it....but so far thankfully besides headaches, heartburn, and having gestational diabetes i have had it easy compared to a lot of the ladies on here..",
