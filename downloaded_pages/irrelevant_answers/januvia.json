            "answer": "Hello,I apologize for my delayed reply, I have been on vacation.As far as I know, Januvia is not associated with slowed wound healing. Diabetes IS however so it is more likely that the disease is behind the slowed healing instead of the medication. If the Januvia is not keeping your glucose levels under control then you should speak to your doctor about an alternative regimen.Take care.",
