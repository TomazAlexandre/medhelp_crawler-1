            "answer": "Dear Wuerffel,Thank you for your question regarding healthy options for what I would\u00a0\u00a0call \"performance enhancement.\"You may have discovered from reading other postings that I often answer a question with more questions in order to provide you the best possible answer.1. Can you tell me more about what you do?2. Do you feel like you have trouble concentrating, staying on task,\u00a0\u00a0feeling too tired to work, or unmotivated?3. Have you discussed your problem with your personal physician? If so what does he or she think is going on?4. Do you have any other medical problems, take any medications on a daily basis, or take any other supplements, herbs, types of alcohol regularly?5. How do you sleep at night? How many hours do you sleep each night?The bottomline is that over-the-counter products that are marketed to increase stamina, increase energy, and prevent fatigue can be dangerous to some people.~ Dr. ParksThis answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice.

            "answer": "Hello,As far as your questions:1) I work at a zoo; doing alot of physical labor, always under stress due to lots of tasks and only 8 hours a day.2) I don't feel that I lack concentration (except when I start talking during my work, but thats not too often). I feel as though I'm putting forth 100 percent its just not as fast as my co-workers 100 percent.3) I don't have a regular doctor. I'm 6'3 280, normal BP, father has Diabetes (could that be a factor if I possibly have it). I eat healthy whenever possible.4) No medical problems. I don't take any vitamins or anything.5) My wife says I may have sleep apnia (sp?), but I don't feel tired at work. I get an average of 8-9 hours of sleep.I hope these answers help. Its a odd situation I'm in. I don't feel like I work slow, but apparently I do according to everyone I work with.",

            "answer": "Dear Wuerffel,It sounds like you have an important job that requires a significant amount of physical labor. It also sounds like you are committed to your job and are putting your best possible effort into your job.Everyone works at a different pace, and from what you have told me so far, you are getting your work done.With regard to your answers to my questions, you might consider approaching your personal physician (because you do not have a health care provider, you should strongly consider getting one) to inquire about a diagnostic test for diabetes (because of your family history and body habitus). In addition, with regard to sleep apnea, many people with sleep apnea may think that they are sleeping through the night even though they are not getting restful sleep. If your wife tells you that you snore loudly, that you occasionally stop breathing during sleep, or that you wake up gasping for air, then you might consider approaching a health care provider to rule out obstructive sleep apnea.Another medical condition that can cause fatigue and daytime sleepiness is a condition with your thyroid gland.Lastly, based on your height and weight, your body mass index (BMI) is 35 (obese category). Being obese puts you at risk for numerous health conditions and physical fitness has been shown to lower the risk of many of these health conditions.So, in conclusion, I recommend that you strongly consider finding a primary care health care provider with whom you can discuss your concerns regarding your work performance. I congratulate you on your work ethic and encourage you to continue focusing on doing your job and not worrying about what your co-workers say to you.I hope these comments are helpful and best of luck to you.~ Dr. ParksThis answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice.

    "question": "Hello,For the last couple years now, my co-workers have said that I'm a very slow worker. Hard working, but slower than everyone else. Is there something safe that I can take like Ginseng, caffeine, etc. to help me speed up my work? I hate to take something unhealthy but I'm tired of the ridicule. Thanks!!!",
