The doctor will ask for many tests, and you can also ask for the thyroid analyses, etc There is also a Ped endocrinology expert forum here, you can post and see what is the opinion of Dr. Guy.",

    "question": "Help. Our 8 yr. old has excessively dry skin, battles constipation and hardly sweats. She was born this way. We live in a hot state and she has already had heat exhaustion at age of 3. Her skin is so dry that we can cover her in Vaseline after her shower and the next day her skin is flaking again. She drinks plenty of fluids and is currently NOT in any sports. Is there anything we can do to help her?",
