            "answer": "I am 24 year old female that has polycystic ovarian disease . I can only speak for what I know, and I do believe you\u00a0\u00a0can have just a few symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0And also, I wish at 15 I would have been diagnosed and started doing something about it earlier. There is no cure, and don't let her think she can't get pregnant at 18 the only time in my life i was ever on Birth control I got pregnant as soon as I came off of it- and I did'nt know anything about pocs back then. Now, I have not been on birth control because of my high blood pressure. But if she does not have high blood pressure she should Definetly start birth control because that shrinks the cysts adn if she has painful long periods birth control will regulate her. ALSO, I do am Insulin resistant and I do have diabetes.. but I do take METFORMIN (Diabetic Meds) for POLYCYSTIC ovarian disease it also helps and it has made me lose 50 pounds in the last 7 months. I was told the only way to really diagnose POCS was to have a internal sonogram or surgery ..i've had both . But if hse is having painful periods, or insulin resitant you may want to look into this further . I know in my case my excess hair gets worse with age. Every year I get Laser treatment on my face, And just recently I have noticed more hair growing alot of other places. And the Gynocologist and Endocrologist are definetly the best doctors to go to for pocs. I don't know if any of this help, If you want to ask me any questions please feel free!",

            "answer": "Hi Carol,Insulin resistance in women is the biggest risk factor for PCOS and thought to be the cause.Your daughter is also at very high risk of diabetes.PCOS results in reduced fertility not Infertility, and it is usually the easiest form of infertility to treat.Having PCOS and insulin resistance means that it will be hard for your daughter to lose weight, however, losing weight is the most effective treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Regular aerobic exercise will help immensely with wieght, self esteem and the insulin resistance.Metformin is one of the most effective treatments for most women.\u00a0\u00a0I just saw a reproductive medicine dr and he told me that he will not treat any women with for infertility/assisted pregnancy unless she is on metformin.\u00a0\u00a0When I told him I have PCOS he said \"not a problem\".There you go.\u00a0\u00a0Get you and your daughter informed.\u00a0\u00a0PCOS is very manageable.Best wishesSally",

            "answer": "insulin restance can be caused by other things other than PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0you stated that your daughter is over weight which can lead to insulin resitance.\u00a0\u00a0personally i would not jump to using Met right away as it is not the \"wonder pill\" that some would lead you to think that it is.\u00a0\u00a0The first thing that your daughter needs to do is to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0PCOS is a complex disease and has many aspects - it is also a disease of excusion not inclusion which is what many diseases usually are - dx'ing your doctor just upon this little bit of info is too soon IMHO.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that too many women are being told that they have PCOS when they only have one or two parts of the over all disease.\u00a0\u00a0back in the day PCOS was the \"garbage can dx\" for women when doctors did not know what was wrong and after years of it being better and better defined it is becoming that once again.\u00a0\u00a0check out the following sites if you have not already.http://www.pcosupport.org/http://www.4women.gov/faq/pcos.htm",
