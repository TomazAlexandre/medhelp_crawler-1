            "answer": "No: I have the opposite diagnostics: I went from pre-diabetics to normal! I had been diagnosed at age 25 with the 3/4 hours glucose test, I was super fit at the time but had a lot of hypoglycemia crises. I recently did the 1 hour glucose test\u00a0\u00a0(at 16 weeks I think) and it came back normal, I still don't understand that result. I am supposed to have an other glucose test later, we'll see.The effect with gestational diabetes can be (I believe) big babies and babies that come out before their due date. It is really important to eat slow sugars and to have several meals a day.",

            "answer": "this is my 3rd child and the first time diagnosed. i have been on complete bedrest since 23 weeks. so exercise is out for me as well. i saw a diabetic nutritionist and went over the proper way to control it by checking sugar levels and special diet. unfortunately controlling my food wasnt good enough...my levels remained high. i was put on glyburide 2x daily. each week they kept upping my dosage. last week i was told if the medication didnt help i would need to start insulin. so we shall see next week.i was told it effects the size of the baby...and also the lung development. also babys that are born to moms of GD can to be born with their sugar levels off and may need to be monitored and treated in NICU. but DEFINATELY TREATIBLE!i am 35 weeks and my baby is supposedly 7lbs 8oz...i had ultrasound yesterday.",

With hypoglycemia, the South Beach diet kept my blood sugar level regular & I ate small meals/snacks throughout the day. Too bad I didn't stick with it ;) Goid luck with your follow up. It's interesting how many ways pregnancy can affect us ;)adgal: All I'm concerned about is the health of my babies, so that's good to hear. I'm already on bedrest due to threatened preterm labor & I'll be 28 weeks on Thurs, so I'm getting there ;) but expect them early.Tricia: I've been on strict bedrest since 25 weeks. It was modified before that. You're very close to having your baby. That's great! Good luck with your follow-up & thanks for the info.",

    "question": "Well, it's always one hurdle after another & I found out today that I have gestational diabetes. I'm waiting for a call from the dietician re: diet, meds, etc. Because I'm on strict bedrest, I won't be able to exercise, so may be taking insulin or other meds.... Pre-pregnancy I was hypoglycemic (low blood sugar), so it surprises me that I could go all the way to the opposite end of the spectrum, but I'm not really concerned about me. I'm wondering what effects this could have on my babies, if anyone knows. I'll do whatever I need to & I'm hoping that by getting my diet under control, they'll be perfectly fine ;)",
