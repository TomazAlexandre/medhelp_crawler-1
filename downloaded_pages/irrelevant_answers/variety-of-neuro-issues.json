            "answer": "Hello.Even though your MRI was normal, you still have some other tests to do for MS. The CSF needs to be examined for IgG, IgG Index, oligoclonal bands and albumin. The IgG index is especially important.MRI can come back to be normal even if you have MS. There can be no definitive test for MS. The diagnosis has to be arrived at after careful correlation of the test results and the clinical symptoms.Your symptoms are pretty much varied and they are all neurological. I was wondering if all the other tests are done.Regards",

    "question": "I've had issues since 2002. The worst being an episode I had last April with my entire left side going numb, w/ataxia. It took 3 months for me to recover from that, but things are still not back to normal. I live with daily tingling, creepy crawly sensations in my legs and arms. I sometimes have shakey weak hands, and this heavy sensation that goes up into my chest muscles. My neck also has alot of spasms. Along with that I experience problems with my vision. I get blurry dim vision in my right eye. I have double vision when looking up in both eyes. I also have this problem where my left hand curls when it's relaxed. I have woken to numb arms and hands on several occasions. In July I went to see a Neuro for suspected MS, and my MRI was negative, and my neuro just told me to go back to my Rheumatologist. I am currently dx'ed with Fibromyalgia. I've also had issues with swollen lymph nodes in my neck that were biopsied back in 02 and were benign.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that I don't have the typical pain of Fibro, and it seems like I have more trouble with with my nerves.I seem to be getting worse and wonder what this could be and should I see another Neuro?I've already been tested for lyme, lupus, and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Unrelated issues are ovarian cysts, endometriosis and an enlarged Uterus that I'm scheduled to have biopsied as well.",
