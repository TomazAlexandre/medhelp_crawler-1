            "answer": "I don't think it could mean your pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Protein in the urine means that your kidneys are not working right for some reason.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have high blood pressure or diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Are they doing any more blood work?\u00a0\u00a0Did they test your for a UTI?\u00a0\u00a0These are just some things that can cause your kidneys to \"spill\" protein.\u00a0\u00a0Your kidneys act as a filter and there are certain things that should not be able to get through.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, when your body is under some type of stress, they can malfunction and let things like protein and glucose sneak through (which they should not).\u00a0\u00a0Protein in the urine is something they monitor in pregnancy esp if there is high blood pressure because it can indicate pre-eclampsia (along with high BP) or some type of stress on the body.\u00a0\u00a0So I can't say for sure it's not pregnancy but either way I would take another pregnancy test and call your doctor to get more of a work up pertaining to the high protein in your urine.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck.",

    "question": "About 2 or 3 weeks ago, I had a physical done by my primary doctor and everything turned out fine. Yesterday I went for screening/physical/drug test for a job and the said they found high levels of protein in my urine. Besides any of the common diagnoses, could this be a sign of pregnancy too??\u00a0\u00a0About a month or 2 I thought I could be pregnant but the preg. test were both negative. Could there still be a chance I am and there is a problem??",
