            "answer": "Hi,From the symptoms two possibilities need to be ruled out. The first possibility is of diabetes which can cause neuropathy of the bladder sphincter and hence retrogarde ejaculation. The second possibility is of any obstruction in the urethra which is causing obstruction to the ejaculate. Regarding the other problems, it can be due to\u00a0\u00a0infection (Epididymitis or Orchitis) or inflammation, hernia, benign or malignant growths or kidney or ureteric stones My sincere advice would be to get your blood sugar levels evaluated and consult a urologist for further advice.I hope it helps. Take care and regards",

    "question": "hi there, i was just diagnosed with a marble sized epididymal cyst on my left side and a very small one on my right. i first found the lump two months ago and have been to my GP as well as gone for an ultrasound. however, the urologist i was referred to booked my appointment 5 months from the date of diagnosis. along with the cysts i am having other problems such as retarded ejactulation (i last longer than my wife), decreased ejaculation, pain in one or both testicles frequently, ascending testicle during sexual activity, increased size of \"cyst\", as well as pain in my lower abdomen. i am just wondering if these other problems are related to the large epididymal cyst or if i should try to get in to the urologist sooner, or if i need a second opinion all together. i'm only 25 and these problems are driving me insane. any insight from someone with the same problems would be great. thanks",
