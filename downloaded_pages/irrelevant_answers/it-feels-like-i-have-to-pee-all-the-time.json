            "answer": "Did gemh have a GYN exam too? Obviously pregnancy can cause frequency, but so can fibroids and other GYN disorders. Anything that puts pressure on the bladder can cause frequency. As your doctor probably told you, caffeine is a big culprit. Diabetes can cause frequency, too. Pregnancy and GYN problems cannot cause frequency in a 26 year old male, but caffeine and diabetes can cause it in men as well as women. So can some STD's.",
