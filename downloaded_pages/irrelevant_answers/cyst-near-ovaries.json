            "answer": "I suffed from ovarian cysts since I was 14.. I'm 34 now and have just been diagnosed with polycystic ovarian syndrome.. though I haven't had a cyst that has caused me pain or discomfort in years..The best thing to help combat and minimize the occurrence and severity of an ovarian cyst I found was exercise!! The release of serotonin somehow helps.. but I've become an avid Zumba goer and not only did it keep the cysts at bay, but it's a lot of fun..So if you haven't, try finding some form of exercise that you really enjoy, because then you'll be more likely to stick to it rather than dragging yourself to workout..",

            "answer": "Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS) is related to insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0It's often treated with metformin, which is often used to treat Type II diabetes.The best \"natural\" treatment for PCOS is the elimination of processed foods such as breads and bread products and eat lots of veggies, lean meats, healthy fats, nuts, seeds, etc. Avoid fruit, except for one serving/day, or any simple carbs that spike the blood sugar, which, in turn spikes insulin levels.\u00a0\u00a0This will help with weight loss, which will help with the symptoms of PCOS.",
