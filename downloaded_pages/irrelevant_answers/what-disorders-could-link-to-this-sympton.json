            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are a few things you must get tested for: hyperthyroidism, diabetes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, anemia and Vit B12 deficiency. Also you could be suffering from an inflammatory bowel condition such as Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Parasites in the gut like threadworm, tape worm, giardiasis etc can behave this way. Hence a stool test is a must. Problems of gall bladder and liver or that of pancreas too cannot be ignored.I would strongly recommend you to see a gastroenterologist (a specialist who looks after the diseases of our digestive system). Maybe your physician can recommend someone.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Some of your blood work is elevated and you should have a more thorough study to determine what the cause is. There are many different things it could be. One is your kidneys may not be functioning properly. Do you ever take in large quantities of protein? Are you a body builder? Are you excessively thirsty? I hope you are having this checked further through a specialist. Ask your family practitioner who to see.",

            "answer": "I would probably see an Endocrinologist first because they treat hyperthyroidism and diabetes. Look up Sjogren's and see if any of the symptoms fit you. If it sounds like you then you would go to a rheumatologist. Your family doctor can rule out anemia and B12 deficiency. I would see a gastro doctor after all of the above were addressed. Typically gall bladder, liver, and the pancreas would cause you some kind of discomfort or pain. Do you have anything like that? Do you have problems with diarrhea or constipation?",

            "answer": "I have been taking some Chinese herbs for diabetes and 1 thing that has happened is my blood has been circulating extremely better. I can tell because when I lift weights I feel my arms get tighter but it doesn't constrict my veins to the point I have to stop as was the problem before. My kidney seemed to improve because I do not go to the bathroom as frequent as I use to. It seemed every time I would drink especially water with in 20-60 minutes I would urinate. I seem to have been feeling better, my nails are not as brittle although they are still kind of hard everything has improved except the MAIN PROBLEM! my lips (bottom lip especially) has been still very chapped when hard and when soft very damaged and peeling. No matter what state its in hard or soft its a problem. Im leaning toward Sjogren's for 1 because when I brush my teeth I have to wet the tooth paste a few times to get it started because there isnt enough saliva\u00a0\u00a0to do it on\u00a0\u00a0its own also I have a hole in my back tooth which came out of nowhere but i believe its due to dryness of mouth. Now I know you gave me a list of problems so what do you believe could be the problem due to every thing stated here? I appreciate the feed back thanks doc...",

    "question": "I have recently been going through a number of tests to get to the bottom of my symptoms. I would say for years now I have noticed a difference in bowel movements, weight loss, fatigue, when I would stand and yawn i would feel dizzy like i was about to fall over, i started to sweat alot and i mean alot. All of these things I kind of put off because they werent noticeable but for about 2 1/2 years now I have had the worst case of chapped lips. Around the time i turned 17 I use to get dry lips and white stuff around my lips when running and the only thing that could help me was if i chewed gum. That also lead to my skin on my bottom lip pealing off when i would finish. I would take a wash cloth and wipe the excess skin off no problem. Now when i turned 18 i started smoking and the problems continued but when i turned 19 I quit smoking because my lips were starting to get dryer and dryer which made me stop to see what would happen. Even using a warm cloth to wipe the skin didnt work, I would have some skin that peeled and other parts that didint, making it even worse in appearance. I went to see a dermatologists who prescribed me alclometasone dipropionate and later mometasone ointment that had no affect. I went to take a blood test for kidney, liver, urine analysis and these were the results that came back abnormal: ldl calculated 115.8, urea nitrogen (BUN) 7, protein total 8.7, globulin (calculated) 3.9, bilirubin, total 1.6, platelet count 132, protein trace, ur wbc 0-1 if you can tell me what that means I would appreciate it.I noticed my semen has become yellow and cloudy it also is very lucid as a liquid and turns cold as soon as it comes out. This prompted me to take std tests that all came back negative so its not from an std but the main problem is my bottom lip. the way the skin grows and the extra dryness and chapping of the lips are truly embarrassing.",
