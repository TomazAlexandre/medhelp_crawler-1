            "answer": "i have been well over 300lbs for many years,then in march last year i topped 358lbs and was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Its one of the things that i said will never happen to me, well it did. I was put on metformin twice a day, and was told i had a 95% chance of being insulin dependent, i was heart broken and im needle phobic.That was the start of a new way of life for me.I cut my food intake, i dont have anything now with added sugar and everything i eat at home is homemade. On the first of april i enrolled at the gym this was hard as i used a mobility scooter to go everywhere becouse of the arthritis, i rode my scooter to the gym and walked the tread mill 5 mins each day. 11 months on, i am now very near 100Lbs lighter, im on one metformin a dayand my chance of being insulin dependent is 0%, i no longer use my mobility scooter to go to the gym and i do a variety of exercices for about an hour. i also do aqua arobics twice a week. i still have arthritis but not as painfull. I still have another 140lbs to loses but im well on the way.on the thought of having those insulin injections keeps me on the right path.",
