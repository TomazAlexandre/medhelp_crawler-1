            "answer": "I remember you saying that you have cirrhosis... I don't remember to what extent.... anyway, these are the warnings from avandia:Unbound oral clearance of rosiglitazone was significantly lower in patients with moderate to severe liver disease (Child-Pugh Class B/C) compared to healthy subjects.At the moment, I would be quite cautious about avandia: they have been in the news for some controversial reasons: increased risk of heart attacks, and for having GSK funded doctors on the avandia approval board, etc...I'm not making definitive statements that avandia is bad (or good)... just explaining my reasons for being cautious until lots of other people (who need it more urgently... for diabetes, etc.) try it out.",

            "answer": "i am not considering for me since etv+ntz is clearing so much virus that maybe we don t even use interferon to lower hbsag faster, researcher said that it is extremely rare to clear 55% of hbsag in 4 weeks by any drug known, on the other hand i want to know about the study since hcc is the only big risk, early cirrhosis will clear in 1-3 years with hbvdna und and is already regressing.of course anybody wanting to use advandia must have all blood checks every 4 weeks like in a trial to see if any side is developping and people with low liver function cannot use it like most of the drugs, but also in that case we must see clear the risks and benefits, if one has liver cancer (which is equal to death without resection) there are only benefitsunfortuantely liver cancer has no cure, only resection with hbvdna has possibility of life to 10 years for nowin my situation i might also use it but not necessary now, cirrhosis Child-Pugh Class B/C is very advanced and not compensated, it is really another story and there is also risk for death",

            "answer": "Pioglitazone (Actos) is much better about the sides and will probably active against hbv as well since it is all connected with cholesterol and lipids that compose hbsag, to make it super easy sugars get to liver cells for production of cholesterol and lipids that are also used bu the virusunfortuantely these drugs are old and generic being on the market since the 90 and extremely cheap so it will be difficult to see many other info around, but i will talk with researchers for sure being so close to my hospital",

            "answer": "the other connection diabetes/lipids/liver cancer is that diabetes is by very far the highest risk for liver cancer, the second but much lower is uncomensated cirrhosis and then compensated cirrhosis and severe fibrosis share about same risk.on hbe negative any fibrosis higher than 10kpa is at high risk of liver cancer (mild fibrosis20)",

HEPATOLOGY 2010.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thiazolidinedionethis drug is same family as Rosiglitazone (Avandia) which has been foud active on hbsag and hbvdna, question is does TZD lower hbsag since decrease of hbsag inibits cancer growth too and if lowered to und eradicate hbv?",
