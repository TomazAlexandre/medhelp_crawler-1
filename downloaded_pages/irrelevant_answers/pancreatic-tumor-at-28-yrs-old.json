    "question": "After being sick for almost 6 months now, an abdominal MRI has discovered a small tumor on the pancreatic head/tail junction.My symptoms started 6 months ago as generalized swelling and tenderness of the lymph nodes all over my body, nausea, vomiting, weight loss (I have since gained it all back), enlarged spleen.. etc. There was high suspicion I had mono but all of my tests came back negative.Fast forward to last month, I started getting really bad epigastric pain and left upper quadrant pain. It would last for a few days and then die down to a dull nagging pain. I felt it in my back sometimes too. I toughed it out until I had another episode only the second episode I had white stools! Freaky!! Then I had a fever of 101.3. For me to get a fever is extremelyl rare. This is only the second fever I've ever had in my entire life. This is what scared me so I decided to go to the doctor. I saw the greatest PA ever. She ordered an abdominal ultrasound which lead to an abdominal MRI which identified the tumor.I'm just NOT convinced that this could be cancer. Pancreatic cancer at 28 years old is almost never heard of. I'm going to be seeing a pancreatic surgeon at Georgetown University Hospital for biopsy.What else could this be? Could a cyst or a benign tumor be making me this sick? I'm just not convinced it's cancer. That's just too weird for a 28 year old.I don't have any family history of this, only my Grandpa got colon cancer at 75 years old. A few people have had their gallbladders removed and my mom and Grandmother have had diverticulitis. A few of my great uncles have diabetes. Nobody has pancreatic cancer.",
