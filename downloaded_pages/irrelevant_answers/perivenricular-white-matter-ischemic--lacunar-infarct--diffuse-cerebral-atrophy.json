            "answer": "Hi!The changes mentioned in the report would be expected in a 70 year old with a prolonged history of blood pressure. He has a lacunar infarct or a dead area in the deep area of the brain, and this happens due to a lacunar stroke. If your father does not have any neurological symptoms, then this is a silent type, and needs only observation.Diffuse cerebral atrophy and ischemic changes are expected both due to age, and due to diabetes and hypertension. If there are no strong neurological sign, you need to just wait and watch and keep his diabetes and hypertension strictly under control. Take care!",
