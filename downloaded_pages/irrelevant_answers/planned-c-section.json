            "answer": "I would do the planned C-section also. My friend had all the same problems and her doctors also said it will be much easier on yur body if yu just let them do what they have to do. And she was up and walking just after a few days with little pain. her baby was born 9lbs 8oz so delivering her vaginal would of hurt and taken a while. Good luck with whatever yu decide!!",

            "answer": "Good luck with your C Section. I had my son on March 31st via C Section and it wasn't that bad. I was up walking 8 hours after the surgery. Just keep moving and the recovery will go by fast. The strangest part for me was not being able to feel my legs!",

    "question": "So at the doc today they did an u/s and estimated my baby's weight to be 9lbs 10 oz... and also told me that while he is head-down, he's face up and that unless he turns, at his size it would make it really unlikely that I could deliver him vaginally. and also that he's well within the range where they can offer me a planned c-section.I have a couple of good friends that went through 20 hrs of labor with their first and then ended up needing a CS... and then having a planned CS with their second babies and they SWEAR that going with the planned CS is the way to go if it's at all in question. Apparently their recovery time\u00a0\u00a0was vastly easier and shorter with the planned CS after not wearing themselves out with labor first.any thoughts???I am scheduled to be induced on Wed if I want to try vag first... (oh and I'm 80% effaced, but only 1cm dilated and my DD is Wednesday). Oh and I didn't have gestational diabetes. so go figure!",
