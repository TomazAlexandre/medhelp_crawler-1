            "answer": "I also get the upset stomach during my panic attacks.\u00a0\u00a0I throw up get dry heaves and the burning sensations in my chest and arms.\u00a0\u00a0I'm nervous and shaky for quite awhile.\u00a0\u00a0Believe it or not I originally spent three days in ICU.\u00a0\u00a0My heart was beating erratically and I had cold sweats and dry heaves.\u00a0\u00a0They discovered my pottasium had crashed and it took forever to get it back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0The potassium crash caused the initial problem with my central nervous system, but five years later I still battle anxiety and panic attacks. When I took ativan it worked within twenty minutes to calm me down.\u00a0\u00a0A long twenty I might add.\u00a0\u00a0I was later put on klonopin so I was prevented fom getting the attack in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm tapering off that since I am doing better. The Klonopin also took away the anxiety about when the next attack would hit.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck in finding something that works for you.\u00a0\u00a0It really does sound like Panic Disorder.",

            "answer": "I dont throw up or dry heave but my stomach does get very upset, I get very nervous and shaky as well. Erratic heartbeats can definitely be anxiety, as a matter of fact Ive been experiencing skipped heartbeats for the last several days. But I had an EKG and a heart ultrasound last year and I know my heart is healthy which keeps me from losing my mind.A major change in your life (whether illness related or an emotional one such as yours) can definitely trigger anxiety. I had a molar pregnancy 5 years ago which is what started this roller coaster for me. After that\u00a0\u00a0I was convinced that I would die in the middle of the night and that no one would know (my husband was in Iraq at that time) and that my then 2 year old would starve and be left in a house with a rotting corpse!! You can imagine the terror I felt. I wouldn't even sleep which only magnifies the anxiety symptoms.I think most of us feel that there is something seriously wrong and that the doctor just hasn't discovered it yet. I think your anxiety is being triggered by the fact that this is the first time you're alone in 3 years. My husband and I have been separated for the last 3 and i know that when I get panic attacks I get hysterical because I'm all alone with my 7 yr old. Good luck. I agree with Lynn, sounds like panic disorder to me too.",

    "question": "Hi, Last summer I had a horrendous kidney infection that sprang up out of nowhere.\u00a0\u00a0I was almost hospitalized, but after several shots of antibiotics I turned out ok.\u00a0\u00a0A few weeks ago, I was experiencing heart palpitations which turned into a full blown panic attack and went to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0They diagnosed me with low potassium, gave me some pills and Ativan and sent me on my way.\u00a0\u00a0Last week, I checked up with my regular physician, he re-ran my potassium, and did blood work for my kidneys and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He called me earlier this week and said \"Everything looks kinda ok; So basically you're fine.\"\u00a0\u00a0Last night I completely freaked out and had another panic attack. I took an Ativan and after throwing up and hours of nervous shaking and crying, I was able to fall asleep.\u00a0\u00a0My heart is still racing, and I just dont feel normal. I only have one Ativan left, I am scared and all alone. 6 months ago I broke off an engagement, and am living by myself after 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0So, I dont know if this is all related or what?\u00a0\u00a0Do you think it is just in my head - which is what everyone is telling me, or do you think there might be something seriously wrong? Any suggestions?",
