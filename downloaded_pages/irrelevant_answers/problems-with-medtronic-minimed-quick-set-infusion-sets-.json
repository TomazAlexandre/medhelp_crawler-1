            "answer": "Hello,I've been pumping for about 9 years and have been using the Minimed QUick Set infusion sets for about one year.\u00a0\u00a0I have read on another diabetes forum that some batches of infusion sets have had problems.\u00a0\u00a0Those people reported taht Minimed sent them new infusion sets at no cost.I have some questions.\u00a0\u00a0Do you insert your infusion set \"by hand\" or do you use the Minimed \"serter\" device?\u00a0\u00a0I highly recommend using the \"serter\" even if you need to buy it.\u00a0\u00a0I had to buy mine, but others were able to get one for free.\u00a0\u00a0The serter is an insertion device that ensures a quick, smooth insertion.\u00a0\u00a0That insertion is much more precise than most of us can do by hand.I have read that the 90degree sets (like QUick Set) are more likely to crimp than the angled sets.\u00a0\u00a0Minimed makes angled sets and an insertion device for it.\u00a0\u00a0I have read that Animas has infusion sets with an integrated insertion device, altho' I am not sure if they are selling them yet.Are you very slim?\u00a0\u00a0Is there a chance you're inserting into a location that's scarred from injections or insertions?\u00a0\u00a0The Quick Sets come in 6mm and also 9mm cannula length.\u00a0\u00a0If you are slim, I would recommend the 6mm since you're more likely to get into fat (which we want) and to avoid inserting too close to a muscle or bone.Your experience sounds very scary and I hope you are feeling 100% better now.\u00a0\u00a0Like the others, I'm not a physician, but have had diabetes for over 35 years.",

None of us are doctors here, but volunteers who are touched with type 1 diabetes in one way or another.I can't add more than WAK or LRS, but I do know that they have much more pump information than I do about the Minimed. I do, however, know how terrible it is to be in the hospital and I also hope you are doing well.Please watch for more comments in this forum and I wish you the best.

            "answer": "One more general thought, as you work with Minimed on this issue...Be sure to carry syringes and a vial of insulin wiht you *always.*\u00a0\u00a0If you get 2 readings that lead you to suspect delivery problems or if you know you're having a problem, take a shot of insulin so that you hae *something* onboard.\u00a0\u00a0This will at least buy you a few hours of trouble-shooting time.\u00a0\u00a0Yup, I re-learned this lesson the hard way.I'm digging thru my memory on other issues to check.\u00a0\u00a0One person had detected a small \"hairline\" crack at the place where the infusion set connects to her (daughter's) pump.\u00a0\u00a0That crack resulted in insulin going into the pump itself and not into her daughter.\u00a0\u00a0Check at the connection site, too.I was surprised by the many body parts that \"theoretically\" can work, as long as we avoid bony or muscular areas.\u00a0\u00a0In the past I was not so diligent but now, I make sure that \"today's\" site is about 1 inch from my last site and that I don't go back to a site for at least *a month*.\u00a0\u00a0I try to use a \"pattern\" instead of my previous rather random insertion, which led to some thickening of the subcutaneous areas in my \"favorite\" areas.\u00a0\u00a0I can't use those areas anymore.Finally, see if you can get yourself another appointment with a certified Mini-med pump trainer in your area, and work with your doctor to insist on a replacement pump, if you believe that there's a pump problem.\u00a0\u00a0It is inexcusable that Minimed not replace the very expensive infusion sets as you work to solve the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Push them (with your doctor's help if needed).\u00a0\u00a0If this problem began rather suddenly, there is almost certainly something wrong.Keep us posted, okay?",

            "answer": "Interesting problem being reported and one that the FDA ordered an immediate recall on many months ago. It's stange that MiniMed hasn't contacted you although their lack of action wouldn't surprise me in the least. More and more users in the USA are becoming dissatisfied with the MiniMed company since its been taken over by the Medtronic's Corp.If you go to the MiniMed webstie there is information about the recall and what to do. It's on their main page along with other problems like their waterproof Paradigm pump isn't waterproof so don't use it in water.Honestly I've gone back to using my old 507 MiniMed insulin pump because I had so many problems with the paradigm and the support service.Some critical problems reported on such sites as DiabetesNet.com will tell you that MiniMed is having problems with:Programming IssuesLoss of Basal RatesI have also experienced:1. A critical motor failure 3 months after owning it and when calling MiniMed support service being told \"You dropped it didn't you\"?\u00a0\u00a0My answer was unless I fell out of bed at 1am and I didn't think so but that interaction convinced me I didn't need to purchase anything else from them in the future.2. Frequency alarm states when pressure is applied to the unit housing during such activity as bending over to lift a heavy object. The unit(s) act as if I have pressed one of the buttons.3. Initial expensive upgrades where they asked me to pay $450 a month after I bought it. I don't know I kind of figure spending over $5000 the month before would have at least been given some type of sliding scale fee.Bottom line is don't expect them to help you much. There are many good insulin pump companies out there these days and at least we have alternatives to MiniMed.",

    "question": "I'm a 24 years old patient with chronic type 1 diabetes and I'm living in Germany. I had been using the Quick Set (without plus)infusion sets for about 9 months combined with the Medtronic Minimed Paradigm 511E insulin pump. But then there occured many problems with a 10 p. box of Quick Set infusions sets, I bought in April 2004. Alltogether, five of the infusion sets' canullas bended under my skin, maybe because of defective adhesives, and the insulin pump failed to deliver insulin to my body. 3 times the insulin pump warned \"Keine Abgabe\" (\"No Delivery\"). But in one case the insulin pump didn't warn. My blood glucose level elevated to a lethally high level. After 2 days of sickness and pain I was hospitalized with a lethal ketoacidosis. I had to spend 3 days at the intensive care unit. The last of the 5 infusion sets which failed I injected - still at the intensive care unit, but after my blood sugar had been brought to a normal level again by the doctors - under the eyes of several doctors. They said, I did everything right, but one hour later my blood sugar level elevated again. I checked my infusion set. From the outside everything seemed to be alright and the insulin pump had not warned. But the canulla was bended again. Alltogether, only 3 of 10 infusion sets did their jobs.It seems, possibly Medtronic Minimed not only has a problem with it Quick Set plus infusion sets, but also the same problems with the newly available Quick Set infusion sets.Did anyone made the same experience with bending of the Quick Set infusion set",
