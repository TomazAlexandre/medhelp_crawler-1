            "answer": "I'd like to get your experiences with sub withdrawal. Twice I have attempted to quit. The first time I went seven full days without any effects other than tiredness. I resumed the subs because I had to work and needed more energy. I tried again last week and went three-four days without any at all. Again, the only w/d symptoms I had were slight sniffles and tiredness. The tiredness steadily gets worse, finally becoming extreme fatigue, which is actually disabling, so I went back on low doses of sub. I'm planning to detox during a time when I have at least a week - preferably two - off work, etc., so I can get off. I've heard of vicodin-type w/ds from sub users, but I never had that. Is that something that would follow after a week of relatively milk, fatigue w/d symptoms?",

            "answer": "Everyone needs to remember that the 1/2 life of sub is 36 hours.\u00a0\u00a0so the dose you took a day and 1/2 ago, is only half gone, that compounded with what you took the day before that and the day before tht and so on.\u00a0\u00a0that is why it is so important to taper as slow as possible.\u00a0\u00a0if you decide to cut your dose, do it, but then stay there for 3 or 4 days, and then cut again and stay there for 3-4 days.\u00a0\u00a0If you start getting any w/d symptoms, hot flashes, runny nose, stomach cramps, anxiety etc, you're going too fast and need to take an extra 1/2 pill that day, and the next day keep with the extra 1/2 for 3 days then cut by 1/2 pill each day for 3-4 days.\u00a0\u00a0If you follow your doctor's advice, and dive into aftercare, you can do this.Assuming that the doctor has never had experience with abuse is not wise.\u00a0\u00a0Just because they are doctor's this disease doesn't discriminate against them.\u00a0\u00a0How many went to detox and the social workers, nurses, counselors were addicts in recovery???\u00a0\u00a0I know alot of them were at mine.\u00a0\u00a0Even if your doctor isn't a recovering addict, that doesn't mean they aren't very well educated on this disease.\u00a0\u00a0Does a cardiac surgeon have to have had open heart surgery to treat his patients??\u00a0\u00a0No.\u00a0\u00a0Does a diabetes specialist have to have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0No, how about an OBGYN?\u00a0\u00a0most of them are men????\u00a0\u00a0they've never had a child?\u00a0\u00a0Just because they aren't addicts, doesn't mean they don't know what they are doing.Vitamins and amino acids are good for everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Not just those detoxing or in recovery.\u00a0\u00a0Eat well, exercise, take your vitamins, and stay in contact w/counseling.\u00a0\u00a0You are doing what you have to do RIGHT NOW to stay sober, and that's all you need to focus on right now.\u00a0\u00a0As the rest of life falls into place,\u00a0\u00a0THEN begin to think about tapering off.",

    "question": "Holy he77 !! thanks for all ur input, appreciate it. i feel like dumping the whole bottle down the drain !!. I am going to take all ur advice and start tapering down the next few days, screw it. I'm taking 6 to 8 mg per day now, tomorrow im only going to take 6mg for a day, although i probably could get away with only taking 4mg in the morning and feeling fine for the whole day, then, well i'll see what happens. After reading all ur posts, i'd be a moron to get hooked on this opiate after geting off the other **** ! believe me , i've only expercienced the wd's from the hydro's, percs, etc quite a few times and they suck,as you guys know. I couldn't imagine detoxing /wd from sumthing 10x worse than my other detoxs/wd's !!. Ya know, im always asking myself how in the he77 did i get into this whole freaking mess and end up an addict ? I know you cant beat a dead horse or kick ourselves in the a**, and we can't turn the clocks back, but boy if i could..............",
