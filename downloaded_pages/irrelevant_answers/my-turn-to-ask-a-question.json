Even with the pump I can be find few days, high few days or low few days. I'm still trying to figure it out. Some of that is my fault because I love carbs. There is a lot of fruits that I can not eat because of gerd.",

    "question": "I have few conditions: juvenile diabetes, celiac disease, gerd, and arthritis. For the past few months my left hand has been bothering me (I'm a lefty). It's a little numb especially the thumb and next 2 fingers. Sometimes is hard for me to grab something and turn the page on a book because my thumb is not strong enough or sensitive enough. My other thumb (right hand) has trigger finger. I had this before for about 1 yr and a half and then it went away. Now is back but I can.t really use that thumb either. Which of my conditions is causing this problem? Could it be a combination of conditions? Which Dr. should I see?",
