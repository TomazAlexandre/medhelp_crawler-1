            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include infections, inflammations, vascular issues, neurological causes such as neuropathies, nerve root irritation, hormonal/ endocrine abnormalities etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by an internist initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, it can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

I have now concluded the doxycycline.\u00a0\u00a0I still have the pins and needles sensation in left hand and foot ( including calf). And now 2 days later the nerve sensation in my penis has returned.\u00a0\u00a0Please can anyone help as this is really getting me down.\u00a0\u00a0I was so relieved when the penis sensation subsided and now feel I am back to square 1",
