            "answer": "Hi,I apologize for the late response. Your question did not come up in the usual queue.Those certainly are concerning symptoms, and I have never heard of them associated with either of those two medications(it certainly does not mean that you as an individual cannot have specific side effects, but they are quite unusual). Have you ever had these symptoms while OFF all medications?Depending on the severity of your reaction, the\u00a0\u00a0re-challenge test is often used to determine if indeed it is caused by the medication. If you have the symptoms while on the medication, then they go away when the med is stopped, you\u00a0\u00a0should then re-try the medication at a low dose and see if the symptoms return. If they do, it is probably from the medication ans you should not be taking it. PLEASE DISCUSS THIS WITH YOUR DOCTOR PRIOR TO TRYING IT AT ALL.Also, you may want to consider\u00a0\u00a0another medication besides Atenolol if possible given that your\u00a0\u00a0heart rate is already so low. Another important matter to discuss with your doc.Take care.",

            "answer": "Although I do have tinitis which is not caused by aspirin (my case anyway), it is nothing like the sensations that are going on.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that it is more than likely side effects from the glimepiride for the T2.\u00a0\u00a0I am curious whether anyone has had similar side effects.",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with T2 Diabetes and have had some episodes that concern me.\u00a0\u00a0When diagnosed with pre-diabetes I was put on Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0This was the first time I experienced this reaction.\u00a0\u00a0It was like symptoms for a stroke or heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0After this happened a couple of times I quit taking the Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0About a year later I was then diagnosed with T2 and am now on Glimepiride and have since began having these episodes again.\u00a0\u00a0They begin in the jaw area primarily the glands just below my jaws, with a sting/tingling that intensifies and radiates out all around my ears, neck throat and surface of my chest, and my upper torso goes ice cold.\u00a0\u00a0This takes place any where from a 30 second to a 3 minute cycle.\u00a0\u00a0My heart is fine after undergoing all the tests in the book.\u00a0\u00a0I do take atenonol which we recently cut in half (a resting pulse ranging around 45 - 55 and BP around 112/60).\u00a0\u00a0My BP has come up to around 122/65, but the pulse still maintains in the low 50s.\u00a0\u00a0My gp is at a loss with the symptoms, and I can't find any similar where ever I look.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?",
