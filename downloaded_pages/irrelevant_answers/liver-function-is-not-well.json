            "answer": "There is no way to really answer your questions without more information.Hepatitis C is curable but you said you don't have it.Some liver diseases are auto-immune and those are generally not curable but can sometimes be managed.Drug and alcohol liver injury can be halted with the cessation of the offending agent.Fatty liver disease can usually be managed with diet and some people think Vitamin E is helpful. Fatty liver disease is quite common.Wait for a diagnosis and try to relax in the meantime.Good luck,Mike",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.If you have jaundice and abdominal pain it could be due to hepatitis B. Diagnosis of hepatitis B infection is based on the raised levels of HBsAg of IgM type. For convalescence it takes anywhere between 6-9months, depending on your antibody titers.The liver function tests can show raised enzymes. As you wait for the results, you could follow certain precautions. Avoid smoking and alcohol. Avoid drugs like paracetomol and sedatives. Get vaccinated for hepatitis A. Take a good protein diet.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
