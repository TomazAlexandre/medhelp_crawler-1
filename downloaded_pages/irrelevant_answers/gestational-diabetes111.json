            "answer": "I think you should at least speak to your dr before Only dieting. Bcuz its depends on the severity of it also. A good friend had it when pregnant and she had to give herself injections 4 times a day diet didn't help. And ur being so high she had to do something. It's not often though alot of ppl get it as badly as her. But I'd find out from Dr first",

            "answer": "I have gestational diebetes, im now 38wks, it isnt just sweet things that need to be careful of but your amount of carb intake so entails cutting down on portion size's of bread, pasta,\u00a0\u00a0potato etc It can be controlled through diet & just need to check bloods before & after main meals, its frustrating but end of it all you want to make sure do everything can to ensure have a healthy baby.

My first pregnancy it was way out of control no matter what I ate , with my others wasen't as bad but was still on the lowest dose of insulin in the end! This time I've been tracking my sugar since 14 wks and so far so good w/just diet ! But if I eat someting like a\u00a0\u00a0doughnut I get a high\u00a0\u00a0reading !! My doctor allowed me to skip the glucose test this time because of my history and just sent me straight to the educator so I could start tracking my sugar earlier, which in my case I agreed because why put my body threw the test when most likely I have it and I do..my point is u don't know how bad or good it is unless ur testing ur sugars every pregnancy is diffferent !",
