When you get things set up we can help you with some of the questions to ask.Getting started with the right team is worth the time investment. I don't know your history, but organize all your blood tests, biopsy report,etc, including the original slide sets and bring them to each doctor. If you're missing any tests, try and get them first.At a very minimum you want to have your genotype, viral load, AST, Alt, hemoglobin, ANC, platelets, INR as well as a standard health screen. Your GP should be able to order these tests if you don't already have them.-- Jim",

I was less clear on this when I did all my shots together, but now that I sometimes do the Procrit all by itself I do feel xtra sides often shortly after the shot. Hard to describe -- just more of that poisonious feeling on top of that poisonious feeling. LOL. As far as your question as to whether Procrit's sides go away after you're off it -- if you mean does Procrit have any long-term sides, I really have no idea. Except maybe it might help you win the Tour de France. LOL.That said, Procrit is the lifesaver that allows many of us to stay on tx without reducing the meds.-- Jim",

            "answer": "I guess it's like the old song on chemo. Give enough to kill the cancer but not enough to kill the person.Interferon is produced by the body but no where near the amounts we take. Just look at what it does to many of our bodies while on tx. Yes, it kills the virus but what else does it do to us? Jury still out, especially in the very long term.That's the risk we all take when we start treatment A risk not enough doctors fully explain to us. That's why I harp a lot on the \"risk/reward\" thing and liver stage when people ask about treating or not. The only right decision is an informed decision and that means knowing not just the potential good of these drugs but their potential harm.-- Jim",

            "answer": "I'll also add that it's not just the absolute toxicity of the drugs we take -- I'm sure there are drugs even more toxic -- but it's the very long duration we take these drugs. I personally couldn't see going beyond 48-72 weeks with these drugs unless my life was close to eminent danger of ESLD. But keep in mind I've having a particularly rough time of it.That's also why I find some of these \"short-course\" tx studies so appealing and wish researchers here in the States would take the lead in duplicating some of them. I find it disturbing that we aren't doing more in this respect. That way, shorter treatments could become standard for many of us saving our bodies from these drugs. They could especially become an option for those with less liver damage who still can afford to re-treat at a later date should they not SVR.-- Jim",

            "answer": "It's very common for docs to recommend treatment to geno 2's withouth a biopsy. Reason is that it's a shorter (24 wk) tx with 80 percent chance of success, overall. That said, it's still a personal decision and if you have strong reservations about tx, getting a biopsy isn't a bad idea. If it turns out you have little or no liver damage, you might decide to wait a little and see what the newer treatments have in store.If you do decide to treat now - biopsy or not -- and it is very tempting with the high success rate -- consider the newer \"short course\" treatment.Two studies suggest the same success rate with 12 weeks of Peg Intron or 16 weeks of Pegasys as you would have with the standard 24 week treatment. The caveat is you have to be non-detectible at week 4, so following this route, a sensitive week 4 PCR test is a must.So again, if you clear at week 4, you treat another 8 weeks (if on Peg Intron) or another 12 weeks (if on Pegasys) and are done.If you don't clear at week 4, you then have two options. Either continue on with the standard 24 weeks of treatment, or simply bail out to fight another day, with perhaps another drug. In that scenario, you've only exposed yourself to 4 weeks of these meds.Just to be clear, the \"stopping at week 4\" is my own personal tx hypothetical extrapolated from I've read and experienced. Don't know any doctors advocating it, but it makes sense to me.-- Jim",

But a better option would be to make a day trip to Boston and have a Fibroscan test. You would contact Dr. Afdhal, Chief of Hepatology and Director of the Liver Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. He represents one of only three centers in the country now running FDA approval trials for Firbroscan. In addition to the Fibroscan test, you couldn't get a better consult than Dr. Afdhal with your tx issue.-- Jim",
