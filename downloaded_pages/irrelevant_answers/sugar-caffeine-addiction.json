I was so tired, headache, nausaus, achy when I tried to cut all at once. So yes some people get a headache, others get the full wds. Try to go to yo a can at a time then decrease that.",

            "answer": "Both sugar and caffeine are addictive. If you're just having a cup or two of unsweetened coffee or tea in the morning, caffeine can be a pretty benign addiction (guilty) in the sense that there's no proven detriment to your health. Sugar, especially in soda, is another story. Soda is basically liquid sugar, and too much of it poses some serious health risks (diabetes, obesity) as well as really messing with your mood and energy levels. I'd try weaning off it if you can, it's bad for you for sure.",

    "question": "I'm not sure if this even belongs in this section, but it seemed like the only 1 that fit. I feel like I'm addicted to caffeine, if not addicted, possibly borderline. I've been knocking back Pepsi sodas like they're water. When I'm out of it, I think about the taste. It's so good when I drink it. I'm pretty sure it isn't very healthy to intake this much. I often think about the effects it has & can have on my body, in the future. I don't know if it's the sugariness, the caffeine, or both. I bought more today, after remembering I was down to 1 bottle. I'd like some opinions on this, any help would be appreciated.",
