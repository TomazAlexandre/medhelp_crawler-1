            "answer": "Hey there,I'm sorry to hear that your son is struggling with Meth. As a parent, that must be a very scary place for you to be. What kinds of things have been done to work on this serious situation?Is he testing his blood sugar or allowing someone to do it for him? The primary concern with Meth and diabetes hypoglycemia. People don't eat when using and if they are still taking Lantus at bedtime then they are at risk of having severely low blood sugar when they are sleeping. I would consult with your doctor for treatment direction and suggestions.You are on the right track in helping your son am I'm glad you found this forum. Keep posting and let us know how things are going. Peace",
