            "answer": "I've been checked for just about everything. My sugars are fine, although I have unexplained neuropathy. I've decided after reading many of these posts, that I am going to call my gyno and have further tests done- 3 women in my family have had breast cancer, I've never given birth, and I have alot of the symptoms. I keep telling myself that I'm fine, but this little voice inside of my head is insisting something is NOT okay....thanks....",

            "answer": "Hi babs - Trust your inner voice. You need to be an advocate for your health - I would suggest a transvaginal ultra sound, and maybe a ca-125 test. The transvaginal US is a little uncomfortable, but not painless. Have you tried acupuncture for your neuropathy? I find this helps me with mine. I also had C-Diff and had to be on Flagyl for 2 weeks. Yuck! I caught it when I was first diagnosed with OVCA. My doc said it was most likely due to the fact that my immune system was down. Good luck, and keep us posted! With love, Deandra",

    "question": "I've been having health issues for several months. Unexplained foot fractures(5) though my bone density is normal, gastro including unexplained nausea, vomiting and diarrhea.Intermittent fevers, fatigue, with low B12( months of injections haven't helped) low thyroid although I've been on medication for years and it has always been under control, weight gain and stomach pressure. My last round of blood work showed C-Diff with A and B toxins. I have no idea where this came from.I've been on Flagyl for 5 days, but the diarrhea persists. I had a Ct scan this morning and it showed a fibroid in my uterus, but I was told it was common. No other gastro signs. I know something is wrong, but I feel like a hypocondirac.My doctor feels there is an underlying illness, but they called me to say not to worry. Is a Ct scan always the best way to determine Ovarian Cancer? Am I over reacting?",
