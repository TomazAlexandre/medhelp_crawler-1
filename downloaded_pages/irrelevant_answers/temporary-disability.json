            "answer": "You posted previously and were given feedback that your husband's diabetes was dangerously out of control and he needs to be on insulin. You both seem to continue to focus on his work schedule and refer to him \"losing everything he has\". If he loses his eyesight or his legs he won't be driving too far. He is seriously at risk for these complications. I don't know about \"temporary disability\". But he needs to take some sick time or get a local job or whatever,\u00a0\u00a0and see a doctor to begin a regimen of insulin. You need to get your priorities straight.",

            "answer": "Re-reading your posts, I have a feeling you recognize the need to do this, but your husband does not. You may have to be a lot more persuasive with him and let him know you care more about him than his job. But the bottom line is you can't make another person do something they are unwilling to do. I believe you said previously his numbers have been high for five years? Perhaps he will not get the message until he is stopped in his track by complications and needs to go on disability permanently. Sad.",

            "answer": "Who. Let's not think about his \"complications\". Let's think about the Mom, her husband and sister with her seven year old, six year and four year old smiling happily singing songs when your husband loses control of\u00a0\u00a0his eighteen wheeler and kills them, paraylizes the husband and blinds her sister. The CDL regulations are strict, but they were not put there for nothing. High blood sugar causes loss of situational awareness. Loss of situational awareness in an eighteen wheeler endangers others. If I knew there was a trucker who let his diabetes go out of control and continued to drive I would ensure he not only lost his job and his CDL but I would see that he ended up breaking rocks for a year or two.\u00a0\u00a0Your husband's conduct is irresponsible and reprehensible.\u00a0\u00a0It is immoral. It is very likely that with a little more exercise, tighter control of diet, weight loss and the use of Lantus (whether or not he has to tell them), he could continue to work safely and productively. He probably can make-do without use of regular insulin for more than a few years. And as for it being \"impossible to see a doctor on a trucker's schedule\", that is absolute nonsense. He is limited to ten hours of driving a day. That leaves fourteen free hours each day.\u00a0\u00a0There is also such a thing as \"vacation time\". For the record I have a CDL, Trucks to 80,000 MGW, doubles, tripples, tankers with a HAZMET endorsement. These rigs are nothing to be horsed around at seventy miles an hour with out-of-control diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your husband is headed for trouble. Big time.",

            "answer": "The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration began accepting applications for waivers for trucker's with diabetes as of Sept. 22, 2003. The FMCSA set up a diabetes waiver program at that time for those drivers not in complience with 391.41 (b) (3). Driving without such a waiver is not only a federal offense, with imprisonment penalties as well as fines, but it may result in permanant revocation of all driver's priviliges. The point of contact for obtaing such a waiver is Ms. Abott, CDL Intrastate Diabetes Waiver Program, 703-448-3094.

            "answer": "I am sure you dont want to be lectured, however, let me share my experience. I was diagnosed with Type2 diabetes in 1997. I spent 10 years ignoring it. I took my medication if i remembered to test my blood (which was rare). i was pleased if my sugar was below 300.\u00a0\u00a0If a doctor told me to take better care of myself, i changed doctors, not wanting the lecture.\u00a0\u00a0I ate what i wanted, drank what i wanted, and pretty much felt ok.\u00a0\u00a0THEN, in 2007, i woke up to vomiting, severe backache, quick breathing, sweating, shaking, lethargy, you name it.still i didnt believe that i was that sick.\u00a0\u00a0After 2 days of this, my husband forced me to go to the doctor, who in turn, ordered me to get to the hospital. ASAP. upon arrival, i was immediately admitted. I had Diabetic Ketoacidosis. they told my husband i was less than a day away from dying. i spent 8 days in the hospital, 4 of which i do not remember. My sugar was over 700, and my A1c (normal is 5.0 to 7.0) was 14.7.I was scared straight.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that your husband reads this and takes the time to see a doctor.",

            "answer": "Let's put this in proper perspective. We have 10,000 gallons of fuming nitric acid barreling along the highway behind a Kenworth with an \"A\" CDL under the control of a driver who is diabetic and too irresponsible and immature to obey the law regarding his illness. And provides nonsensical excuses to his wife about why he won't do this.\u00a0\u00a0He is tired and knows he shouldn't have a jelly donut, but the waitress is cute...and what the heck. A diabetic coma creeps up on you. It doesn't come all at once.\u00a0\u00a0And then we have three school buses full of grade school children happily singing as they convoy their way home. And the driver loses his sense of situational awareness and barrels through a red light. Whatever a person does to themselves is a personal matter. When they endanger others it becomes everyone's business.",
