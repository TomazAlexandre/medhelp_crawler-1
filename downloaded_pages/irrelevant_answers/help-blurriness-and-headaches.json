    "question": "I went to the eye doctor back in September....I got my glasses and my contacts. Everything seemed fine. Until about a month ago when I noticed some blurriness in my right eye. So I scheduled an appointment with my eye doctor. He changed the prescription because my right eye couldn't see like my left eye. He gave me another strength which was worse. Blurry splotches and so forth. So I made another appointment, he gave me another strength, which was also bad. I could see straight through but blurry around the eye. So I made another appointment. He made me do a test where I click this device every time it see a lime green light. There was a small blue on the right side of my eye Nextel to my cornea. He schedule a follow up in a week to see of it went away. It didn't. Just was a little bit smaller. At home I found some old contacts, tried them and they worked! Went back and he couldn't tell the strength because I didn't have the contact box. So he put me in yet another strength. Which worked a lot better. When I got to work my eye felt different. It just felt detached? I can't describe it. So the next day I wore my glasses which seemed worse than normal. It felt like there was a very small pressure on right eye giving me a slight headache. It also seems like my left eye sees brighter than my right. I'm freaking out. Help?!",
