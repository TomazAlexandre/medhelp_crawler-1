High phosphorus is found in cheese, meat, egg, lentils, nuts, milk etc. The reading is marginally higher.

    "question": "I've got all of my tests done, and the only thing out of range is the phosphorus, which is at 4'8 instead of being at 2.2 or 4.5. What can I do to fix it? There is something I can eat? Or not eat? However how did I got this out of range? It could be caused by some infection (I'm curing my sinusites) Or injury? Please help me put. Thank you!",
