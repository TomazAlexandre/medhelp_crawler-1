    "question": "OK,First post on forum. Diabetes for 7 years. Type 2 progressed to full insulin shortly. runs in the family.Went to a new doctor today and was getting examined and he told me a new treatment was out. He said about an inhaler. Well I know about insulin inhalers but didn't know if they were used much. So I asked them if this was what he was talking about and he said no. He said the medicine reacted with your pancreas.He said he would review the blood work with me and see him again in 3 months and he would prescibe the meds if everything was ok. He said 95% of his diabetes patients that use it had good results. Forgot to ask him name of medicine.So I have been doing some internet research and can only find insulin inhalers. Anybody know what med he is talking about?Thanks,",
