            "answer": "\"Is this low dose or a very high dose for a new diabetes.\"I wish we had an answer for you but there are no doctors on this forum. A question like this has to be directed to your PCP/Endocrinologist not to non-qualified health forum members.And, having a sedentary lifestyle is not healthy. It will only make diabetes progress faster which leads to unwanted side effects. Take the time to educate yourself on how to control and manage your diabetes. There are numerous web sites having tons of information right at your fingertips. One such web site is the American Diabetes Association [ADA]. Lastly, read other posts on this forum for helpful hints. Good luck",
