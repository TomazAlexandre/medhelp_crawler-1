            "answer": "Yes Becki, you should lose weight, as a fatty liver (liver steatosis) reduces SVR levels. To give yourself the best chance of SVR this is one of the few host factor that can be changed so it is worth doing. Also the more healthy you are going into treatment the easier it will be to deal with the treatments side effects. I had been put on an exercise and diet program in anticipation to treating myself.For more info:Fatty Liver: Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) and Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH)http://www.medicinenet.com/fatty_liver/article.htmGood luck with your treatment!Hector",

    "question": "I am not sure when I will do treatment, but I am about 30 pounds over weight because I have been out of work for 2 years and just put on weight. Anyway my question is, my gastro doctor said I need to lose weight so the treatment will help me but I dont understand cause everyone says that you lose treatment when doing treatment. has anyone heard that if you are over weight you need to lose so tr will be effective? I know that i need to for my health but if im going to lose during tr then i dont get it...thank you, becki",
