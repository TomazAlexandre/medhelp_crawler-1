            "answer": "Yes, it could be the start of low thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0What exactly are your TSH and T3 levels?\u00a0\u00a0Please provide results, as well as the reference ranges, which vary from lab to lab and have to come from your own report.Is the T3, Free or Total? If it doesn't say \"Free\" or FT3 on your lab report, then it's total and is of limited value.Cholesterol levels commonly go up with hypothyroidism. Many people with hypothyroidism also get a puffy face, especially just below the eyes. And of course, there's the never ending fatigue.The numb feet bring another thought to mind -- you should ask to get your vitamin B12 levels tested.\u00a0\u00a0B12 deficiency also causes extreme tiredness, as well as numbness/tingling in the feet/hands.\u00a0\u00a0Many people who are hypo are also deficient in B12.Are you supplementing the vitamin D? Taking anything for the pre-diabetes?",

            "answer": "Are the T3 and T4 levels \"free\" or \"total\"?\u00a0\u00a0If you lab report doesn't specify Free or FT, then the tests are for total T3 and Total T4.\u00a0\u00a0Those tests are considered to be obsolete and of little value.\u00a0\u00a0You need the FREE T3 and FREE T4 tests.\u00a0\u00a0What are the ranges for the T3 and T4 tests?\u00a0\u00a0Ranges vary lab to lab and have to come from your own report.More so than Vitamin D being a sign of parathyroid, deficiency can cause hypo-like symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If you're supplementing D, maybe once your levels come up, your symptoms might start going away.\u00a0\u00a0You need to get your levels over 50 in order for symptoms to be alleviated.",

            "answer": "Do ask your doctor for the FT3 and FT4 tests; those are the ones that will help you get well fastest.Even though you've been on vitamin D and B12 for a month, that may not be enough time to have brought your levels up high enough to alleviate symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know the actual level of B12 when you started supplementing?\u00a0\u00a0Again, if your levels were really low, it would take time to bring them up enough to alleviate symptoms.There are \"desiccated\" forms of thyroid medications that some people call \"natural\" or \"natural desiccated\".\u00a0\u00a0These meds are made from porcine (pig) thyroid and while I, personally, don't see anything \"natural\" about eating pig thyroid, I would, certainly, be willing to try it if I thought it would make me feel better.The desiccated hormones contain both T3 and T4 hormones and some people do their very best on these meds, while others don't.Ask your doctor about the various types of medications. Synthetic hormones, such as Synthroid, Levoxyl, generic levo, cytomel, generic T3, etc are identical to what your thyroid would produce if it could.\u00a0\u00a0The desiccated options include Armour Thyroid, Acella NP, ERFA from Canada.\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors are not willing to prescribe desiccated hormones, because they don't believe the strengths are consistent between batches, etc....... that's all hockey pucks.All options need to be open to everyone, and if your doctor isn't willing to prescribe whatever med will make you feel better, you might want to find one who will.Yes, low thyroid can cause high cholesterol levels; that's one of the main symptoms of hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I notice that your A1c result is 6.3, which, as flagged is high.\u00a0\u00a0A1c is a measure of blood sugar levels over a 2-3 month period and I notice that your blood glucose was 105.\u00a0\u00a0Those results could be affected by thyroid, but I'd guess that they are more closely related to insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0Your pancreas produces insulin, which regulates carbohydrate and fat metabolism.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin resistance is when your body produces enough insulin, but the body doesn't use it properly.\u00a0\u00a0Your levels would put you pretty close to where I'm at and I've just been diagnosed with \"pre-diabetes\", which is the forerunner to type II diabetes.For what it's worth, I was tired of being tired, too and it wasn't easy to get where I'm at today and I still get tired, but nothing like I was when I was hypo, deficient in B12 and vitamin D....... I so understand where you're at.",
