            "answer": "Hi there. I understand your concerns and predicament. Your mother has been having delayed and probably failure of wound healing. This could be due to various causes like smoking, diabetes, depressed immunity states, like leukemia or chemotherapy etc., Nutrition should be with lots of energy, vitamins and proteins to promote healing, lots of oral fluids. Obesity can also delay wound healing. Since the bony flap is not taking up and there are no signs of healthy wound healing and new bone formation, she required exploration and reconstruction of the bony flap. Get her a reconstructive surgeon consult immediately to evaluate the status of bony flap and reconstruction under general anesthesia. Hope this helps. Take care.",

    "question": "My mother underwent surgery for the removal of meningioma (7 x 9 cm) last April 2008. She is getting better but we are so worried about the wound that isn't healing until now. She was 54 years old when she underwent surgery. The surgeon informed us that due to her age, the wound healing delays. April 2009, the surgeon informed us for a reconstructive surgey but my mother refused as she was afraid of the thought to be put with anesthesia again. So, antibiotics were prescribed with the time duration given. The wound was getting better but after taking the antibiotics for a prescribed time, it got worse again until there were debris of bone that were coming out through the wound. So, we convinced our mother to try the reconstructive surgey (mid 2010) just for the wound. There is no improvement of the wound and at some instances, there were debris of bone coming out. CT scan is ok. My mother is good (thank God). But, the wound somewhere in the occipital part isn't healing good & it's been 3 years already. Will it cause any complications (like infections let's say)? For a late 50's patient of post surgery, how long would it really needed for the wound to heal? Is there anything that would help to heal the wound? Is it ok let's say to take the antibiotics again until the wound will be totally healed? Will it not cause any adverse effects to some other systems in the body knowing she's 57 years old?",
