            "answer": "I think this depends on where you live. In the UK its usually two scans. One at 12 weeks to date your pregnancy properly and one at around 20 weeks for checks on heart and limbs and so on. Some people will have an early scan too, I had one at 7 weeks, because we had no idea how far gone I was. I'm pretty its different in America though. Also you can have a 3d/4d later on in pregnancy but you have to pay for it in the UK. Hope that helps.",

            "answer": "Congratulations hun! Im a first timer to. I had a scan at 6 weeks because I wasn't sure how far along I was, another at 12 weeks, then I had my 20 week scan on Monday (I have to go back for another 1 but that's just because baby wasn't cooperating lol) but I think that's all the scans done for me (im in the UK) but I do have a friend pregnant with twin boys and she gets extra scans to keep an eye on babys growth with it being twins :)",

            "answer": "I had one at 10 weeks but that was to find out how far along I was then one at 20 weeks to find out gender and haven't had one again until I was 36 weeks. And that's only to keep an eye on my amniotic fluid and baby's progress because I have gestational diabetes. Most times you have no more than 3 unless they suspect any complications. I get an ultrasound twice a week now. But again it all depends on where you go/live",
