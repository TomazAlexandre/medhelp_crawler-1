I think the one thing that would cause me to get concerned is the need to put her in the hospital for further tests.\u00a0\u00a0Hospitals just aren;t used unless absolutely needed.\u00a0\u00a0I know a persons response to cancer or any serious illness depends alot on their overall physical well being.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a family hx?\u00a0\u00a0I will keep you and family in prayer.",

            "answer": "thank you for your reply and your good wishes.i had not previously considered that sending her to hospital for a week is in itself a sign of bad things to come, but i agree, it certainly looks like that. i have since told my fiance of my concerns and he took it amazingly well.as to her health and family history, she is generally in good health and though there is no known family history of this particular cancer, one of her sons - who is an alcoholic - suffered from severe pancreatitis some years ago and has developed diabetes since. considering that alcohol abuse is just as if not more likely to mess with a person's liver first, i guess this could be read as 'family history of pancreas problems'.all in all, we will just have to wait and see. i am grateful for any opinions on this matter, since i have luckily had no experience of this or any other cancer so far in my life. i am not sure how likely it is that my initial reading of the situation is totally off, i certainly hope it is.thanks again,yaria",

    "question": "this question does not directly concern me and i am more than unhappy to have to ask it on an online forum without even being able to provide fellow members with sufficient information. i apologise in advance.my 60-year-old, non-smoker, healthy mother-in-law-to-be went for a checkup on tuesday. apparently, the ultrasound revealed a small tumor on the pancreas and spots on the liver. since we are not close and i don't want to worry my fiance unduly, this is all the information i have. the doctor referred her to hospital for further tests, she is going next week and is expecting to remain in hospital for several days. as far as i am aware, neither she nor my fiance are particularly worried about this. i have spoken to two doctors i trust, neither of them specialists and done some online research and have so far not been able to even find an alternative diagnosis for these findings. we are due to get married in a year and a half, but since hearing about this, i have speeded up preparations to have the wedding within the next six months. i have not told my fiance of this move on my part, as i mentioned, he is not worried and i don't want to cause him unnecessary distress. can anybody here tell me if i am worrying about nothing or whether this is really as bad as it looks to me right now. please understand, my question is not for a prognosis in case further tests confirm my fears, i simply want to know if those fears are likely to be confirmed.many thanks,yaria",
