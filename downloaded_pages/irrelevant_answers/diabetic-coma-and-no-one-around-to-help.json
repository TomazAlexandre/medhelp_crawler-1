            "answer": "Dear Triplejay98,i am not a doctor and am just another diabetic like you answering from my experience. I have had many severe low blood sugars and understand your concern. i just had one this past Tuesday where my wife had to give me a glucagon injection to get me out of it and a few years back i\u00a0\u00a0had one while driving and lost a leg from injuries and no longer drive because i don't want that to happen again behind\u00a0\u00a0the wheel as i was lucky the first time in that it\u00a0\u00a0was a sinle car accident. If you have trouble feeling the symptoms of hypoglycemiea [low blood sugar] then if you are alone check your blood sugar more frequently until someone else with knowledge of what to do is there. i recommend a glucagon kit which has a syringe with normal saline solution and vial of powdered glucose which should be mixed together the administered 9f the person is unconscious or unable to injest enough food to help the blood glucose rise.hope this helps, bret",
