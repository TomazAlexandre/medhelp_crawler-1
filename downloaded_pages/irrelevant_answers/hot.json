            "answer": "Hi!Underlying infection or inflammation (as in arthritis, IBS etc) in the body can result in the feeling of heat. Another possibility is hyperthyroidism or even diabetes. Antibiotic or other drug metabolism can also cause a feeling of heat in the body. Drink plenty of fluids, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and take multivitamins. Get your thyroid function assessed. Sjogren\u2019s syndrome is another possibility. It can also be due to heart problems, especially if you feel suffocated at night. Menopause in females is also a known cause so get FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone level assessed. If only legs are being affected and at night only, then it can also be restless leg syndrome. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The probable causes for itchy legs are scabies, diabetes mellitus, eczema, tinea pedis (fungal infection) and psoriasis. Scabies infection is caused by a mite Sarcoptes Scabiei, it burrows in the skin folds of hands and feet and causes intense itching mostly at night. Certain infections like tuberculosis can cause an evening rise of temperature and increased sweating. This also causes a loss of appetite; as such this is accompanied by weight loss. So, record your temperatures, on a two hourly basis to detect an evening rise of temperature.\u00a0\u00a0Please check with your doctor to rule out these conditions.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
