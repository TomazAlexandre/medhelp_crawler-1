            "answer": "A highly observant patient and a skilled refractionist can probably define a RX considently to within +/- .25 diopters. However many patients cannot tell changes as large as .0.75 diopters.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can also cause fluctuating glasses RXA phoropter is more accurate and much faster for most people.JCH III MD",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. A prescription within a +/-.25 diopter margin of error should therefore pose no problem since corrections are at least a whole digit and will improve the patient's vision by that much anyway.But what about the corrections for astigmatism? Are the measurements also dependent on the patient's subjective response during the test or are they independent of it and thus more accurate? What is the usual margin of error for the cylindrical and axis values? Can errors in these values affect vision adversely?",

    "question": "1) Eyeglasses and prescription sunglasses are expensive and there is a limited amount of patient's subjectivity involved in acuity and refraction tests. What is the average or acceptable range of accuracy of any given prescription in + or - relevant units or fraction thereof for the following numbers:a) spherical,b) cylindrical,c) axis andd) N.V. addition?2) Does a phoropter produce more accurate or consistent test results than a trial frame?Thank you in advance for your reply.",
