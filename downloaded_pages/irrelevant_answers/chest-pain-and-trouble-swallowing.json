            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The chest pain and trouble in swallowing could be due to gastric reflux. Another possibility is hiatal hernia, where a portion of stomach herniates into the chest cavity through the diaphragm. Both can be diagnosed by an endoscopy. Crohn\u2019s disease and IBS too often cause nonspecific pains. Also along with gastric reflux and hiatal hernia, ask your doctor to rule out diabetes and hypothyroidism.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Just an update.\u00a0\u00a0I have had multiple tests over the past 2 weeks, all of which have proved inconclusive.\u00a0\u00a0Chest x-ray, abdomen ultrasound, barium swallow, upper endoscopy, and extensive bloodwork that was all normal (ruling out lyme disease as I had suspected)\u00a0\u00a0According to all of these, I am in perfect health, but I still have traveling pains that vary in intensity, from my chest to my thighs to my testicles to my head.\u00a0\u00a0It has been difficult to get a diagnosis because the symptoms come and go, and I oftentimes don't have bad symptoms when I have had my appointments.\u00a0\u00a0If you can think of any other ideas, it would be greatly appreciated.One additional note is that I suffered a broken nose and concussion over the summer after being sucker punched in the nose and subsequently hit my head on the pavement.\u00a0\u00a0Could these symptoms be related to my brain/nervous system?",

            "answer": "HiIf all conditions have been ruled out then it could be a case of chronic fatigue syndrome or fibromyalgia. Anemia, low thyroid function, low calcium or Vit D and diabetes too can cause non specific body aches and pains. Fall on head can cause neurological symptoms and not body aches coming on and off. See if you have been tested for the above conditions.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to comment beyond this. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 23 year old male and I am generally in good health.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past 6 days, I have had recurring chest pain mostly under my sternum, but sometimes to the left or right as much as 4 inches.\u00a0\u00a0When I have the pains, they vary in pain by how deeply i breath.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the ER the other night because the chest pain was very bad and lasted for 30-35 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0It felt like I was going to have a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0My EKG and blood work at the hospital were all normal.\u00a0\u00a0In the past 4 weeks, I have also had a CBC, blood chemistry, mono test (Epstein-barr) -- 2 times, strep, HIV, chlamydia and gonorrhea.\u00a0\u00a0All came back negative.In addition to the chest pain, I have also had pains in random areas of my body that last for 1-2 minutes and then go away.\u00a0\u00a0Particularly, I will get pain in my right elbow, both armpits, in front and in behind my ears, minor earaches and minor pain in my abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0I had, and recovered form, bronchitis over Thanksgiving (z-pack antibiotics).\u00a0\u00a0From Dec 10-13 I had stiffness in my neck, swollen lymph nodes and when swallowing, a feeling that something was stuck in my throat.\u00a0\u00a0This resolved by itself, but the feeling in my throat has now come backDoes anyone have an suggestions of what this could be?\u00a0\u00a0Lyme Disease? A yeast infection in my throat? Fungal infection? Esophageal spasm? Costochondritis? Pericarditis?The only other thing I can think of that could be a factor was performing oral sex on a girl about 6 weeks ago, after which a lot of these symptoms began (besides the chest pain).Any help would be great.
