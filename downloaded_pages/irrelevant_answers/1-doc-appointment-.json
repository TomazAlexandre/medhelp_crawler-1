That's what happened to me but I was 19 weeks when I first went and I got my first pictures",

            "answer": "They ask if this is your first pregnancy and if not how many you've had and how many kids you have. They will also ask about your family's medical history (cancer, diabetes, heart problems etc) so it would be good to have that all prepared for when you go. It just helps them know what to look for. They may try to hear baby's heartbeat on the dopplar but if you're not far along they may not hear it. We didn't get one on the dopplar until I was 16 weeks. They will weigh you, take your blood pressure, ask you if you are on prenatals, ask if you want the IPS testing (for downs syndrome) and feel your uterus height (fund us).",
