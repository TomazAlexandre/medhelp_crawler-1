            "answer": "Hi CBassDo you have any other symptoms ? New things that have turned up around the same time?This could be a neurological issue (that is, blocked messages to/from the nerves in your spinal column) but there are usually several other signs and symptoms too.What about the sort of shoes you wear? I'm wondering about the calluses here. Do you play an impact sport? Maybe a podiatrist could help sort it out?Then there are things like gout and diabetes. When did you last have a diabetes test? Do you have any rheumatic/arthritis problems elsewhere?Would you keep us posted on what you find out?best wishessammxx",

            "answer": "At one time my big toes were like that too.\u00a0\u00a0It was strange.\u00a0\u00a0Then I thought maybe it was my shoes.. high heels in particular and smaller pointier closed toes.\u00a0\u00a0They were not uncomfortable, but I thought with my weight pushing down into the toe due to the inclineof the heel and the smaller toe area.... well, maybe!\u00a0\u00a0 So, I stopped wearing that type/style for a while, and guess what??\u00a0\u00a0Not right away, but eventually the feeling came back.You may want to try a wider toe area and little or no incline to your shoe for awhile if this couldapply.Best of Luck!Kim",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You must seriously consider gout. This is due to high uric acid in the body that gets accumulated in the joints. Gout usually attacks the big toe (approximately 75 percent of first attacks). Another possibility is Chondrocalcinosis which is similar to gout but caused by deposition of calcium pyrophosphate rather than uric acid. Diagnosis is by finding the elevated levels of uric acid in the blood. However most confirmatory is study of fluid aspirated from joint to detect urate crystals. The third possibility is rheumatoid arthritis. This can be diagnosed by positive RF and ANA.Alternatively it could be pinched nerve in lower lumbar or sacral spine area. It is difficult to comment on net. If the above tests are negative then a MRI of the lower spine and nerve conduction study may be required.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have numbness in my big toes. Both are numb, but my left one is a little more so, and when I hook the toe next to it under and rub it I get a shooting pain like a burning shock. I tell you it really gets my attention. I hurts really bad when I do that. They are numb mainly on the outside half of each one. The left one is more so. I also get hard calluses built up on the outside edge of each one. What in the heck is going on? I would like to know what is causing it.This discussion is related to/posts/show/659521.",
