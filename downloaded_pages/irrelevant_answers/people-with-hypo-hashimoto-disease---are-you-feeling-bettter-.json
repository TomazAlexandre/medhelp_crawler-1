While I don't always feel \"great\", my dose of Tirosint has been stable for a couple of years; only needed a slight increase in T3 med.\u00a0\u00a0I'm guessing that, like goolarra's, my thyroid has given up the ghost.Also, like goolarra, some things I hadn't considered to be thyroid related are gone.Keep plugging along; you'll get there.",

            "answer": "As the antibodies destroy your healthy thyroid tissue, your thyroid will produce less and less hormones, so yes - your dosage will have to be adjusted to accommodate this decrease in natural hormone production.My experience is not \"normal\", in any sense of the word, because by the time I was diagnosed, my thyroid was pretty much non functioning (TSH of 55+, with FT4 below range). The doctor who diagnosed me tried to control my condition by adjusting TSH only... I thought he would kill me, but fortunately, before he succeeded, I got sent to an ENT, I'd seen for other issues and he recognized right off the bat that I needed help, did further testing and referred me to an endo, who prefers diabetes over thyroid, but isn't bad and pretty much lets me drive my own treatment, based on how I feel and my FT levels....I've finally settled out at 88 mcg Tirosint and 7.5 T3...... it's working good for me, now.\u00a0\u00a0I get through most days without naps (sometimes crash mid day, depending on stress levels), sleep good at night (6-7 hrs)..... only issue I still struggle with is weight and that's probably more my fault, right now, than anything else.",
