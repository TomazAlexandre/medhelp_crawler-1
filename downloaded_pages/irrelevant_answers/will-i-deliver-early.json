    "question": "okay so. My doctor sent me to a Specialist to check on baby. Well he never told me that I was going to a specialist. He told me that he was going to diagnose me with Gestational Diabetes but I didn't have Diabetes (he was doing that cause my test came back border line) so I thought the appointment he set up was going to be all about my sugars. Well it wasn't that at all . It was an ultrasound of them checking baby's weight. Which they did and he is 5 pounds 4 oz and was measuring 2 weeks and a couple days ahead. (I'm 32weeks) well the Specialist said I do not have GD and that he wanted to see me back July 1St to check baby's weight because he is concerned in baby's weight. Well I guess my question is. Has anyone went through this? And did yall end up delivering early?",
