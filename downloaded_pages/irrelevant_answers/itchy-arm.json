            "answer": "Hello,Since you are having numbness of the foot and toe, so this inner itch that you are describing can be due to parasthesia. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not. If the symptoms persist then please consult a physician.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing or in case you have any additional doubts.",

            "answer": "Dear Doc. You answered my question, but you got it all wrong. Maybe you could read over my problem again. I don't have numbness in my feet and legs. I don't drink alcohol either. It would be wonderful if you could take another look at my blog and try to answer again. My blog is right below my post. Thank you kindly.Every so often my left arm gets all itchy. Left only and usually from the elbow down. Then it disappears and nothing for month. It gets worse at night and when I'm scratching it. I wake up because of the itch. I have used Benadryl cream and any cream under the sun that is suppose to stop itching. I have used Benadryl tablets. Nothing works. I take an icepack to bed with me and when the itch starts I wrap my ice pack around my arm. It helps, but it just numbs the arm. I have tried to pay attention to certain foods. For the longest time I thought that it was the sun, because my arm was itchy in the summer, but the itch went away in the winter. I spoke to my doctor about it, but she just looked at me like I was crazy. No rash, just severe itch.ANY suggestions would be greatly appreciated.",

            "answer": "Hello,Skin conditions like psoriasis, dermatitis, fungal infections and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods can cause itchy skin. The other possibility that needs to be ruled out is brachioradial pruritis. Brachioradial pruritis is an intense itching sensation of the arm usually between the shoulder and elbow of either or both arms. The itch can be so intense that sufferers will scratch their own skin to a bleeding condition.To diagnose it, an examination by a dermatologist is mandatory as biopsy of the skin may also be done to confirm the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
