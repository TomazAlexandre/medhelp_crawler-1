            "answer": "Sorry to hear that you have been so unwell.To be honest, I have found it very difficult to read such a long post split into 3 parts.\u00a0\u00a0But, nonetheless, by what you write, I can see that you do need to be under the guidance of a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Having arrhythmias is all to do with your heart and you must following the advice given to you by your doctor and cardiologist.Some people are born with a heart defect and sometimes this does not show up until they are much older when they get very fast heart beats and need immediate help to slow down the heart rhythm.Do not be too alarmed about the different sugar level readings that you have had done by using a glucose monitor.\u00a0\u00a0This only measures the glucose that is in your blood stream at the time the test is being taken.\u00a0\u00a0Even in people who are not diabetics, the glucose levels will fluctuate (go up and down) depending on the time of day the test was done and if they had eaten and how long afterwards the test was done.If you are very worried about this, ask your doctor to do a blood test to check your HBA1C.\u00a0\u00a0This blood test shows the average amount of glucose that sticks to the red corpuscles.\u00a0\u00a0The red corpuscles get renewed approximately every 3 months and the HBA1C test will show the average amount of glucose in your blood stream over that period of time.Sometimes a doctor may send you to have a fasting glucose test done.Being very thirsty and urinating a lot can also be due to other causes, especially if you have eaten a lot of sugar and/or salt.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes going to urinate a lot during the day and especially if you have other symptoms, may indicate a urinary tract problem.Make sure that you take your medications as prescribed by your cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Do not stop taking your medicines if you feel better unless directed by your doctor or the cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0If the medication makes you feel ill, speak the doctor or cardiologist as they may be able to prescribe an alternative medicine that suits you.Ask your doctor for advice with regard to physical game playing and listen to your body so that you do not over do things.You are doing well by cutting down and avoiding sugary foods.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you have healthy and well balanced and drink your water.\u00a0\u00a0 Your doctor will advise you on the amount that is suitable for your age, but do not drink excessive amounts (no more than 2 litres) as drinking too much water can be just as dangerous as being dehydrated (not having enough).I do not think that you have diabetes, but this can only be confirmed by having the proper tests carried out.\u00a0\u00a0A HBA1C test is done by having a blood test.\u00a0\u00a0With a glucose test, you are give a glucose solution to drink and your blood will be tested before and after you drink the glucose.\u00a0\u00a0This is done when you have not eaten or drunk anything but water for a specific amount of time.Please be aware that I am not a doctor and am only giving you this information on the knowledge that I have.\u00a0\u00a0You must see a professional and get the appropriate tests carried out to be given a correct diagnosis and the appropriate treatment.Best wishes.",

    "question": "He told me not to take anything unless paracetamol because of the flu that he noticed me. Inderal I could not take more. I followed what he said, but then when the night came I started to feel much the same lack of energy, my lung was locked and I was a little short of breath, I found strange flu leave me like this, after all my fee leukocytes were normal my blood count was normal, was not anemic, always had a good vitamin enriched food. How much worse I ended up taking Scaflam (Detail: Diabetics can not take Scaflam) which is also for fever as well as the lack of energy Paracetamol.Por\u00e9m much worse and I did not understand why I felt feeling faint again but did not faint.The day I went to the ultrasound I got sick in the hospital, my blood pressure rose to 16 by 9 something. I was very tired and my hands and legs were tingling too, this time also hands tingled, and I had not made some effort on the day. That same day a new symptom appeared. The blurred vision. Depending on how far I looked I saw things blurred. They said it was because of high pressure. And the tingling in the hands and legs they said it was because of arritmias.E soon after came an unexplained fever again, this time of 37.6 \u00b0 C. They gave me some medicine into the vein with saline to reduce blood pressure and fever. Did two electrocardiograms that day but they said all arrhythmias were sinus justified by the accelerated heartbeat. The cardiologist advised us that it would be of utmost importance to Holter monitoring to detect any arrhythmia that was occurring at a time that they were not doing the electrocardiogram. So I did. He also asked for some tests, including a 24h urine, and a blood test that I will do to detect vanillylmandelic acid, if I have pheochromocytoma. When I returned to school this week, my friends noticed a big difference in my weight, they said I was too skinny. And often I feel this lack of power that gets worse when I eat very sweet. And my vision blurring walks as if he had smoke in any environment that will, this symptom comes and goes. A long time also makes it feel a ringing in the ear when I'm in a quiet environment, like I was the flu but I'm doing this one months, before the flu and feeling still feel the same because of the flu has healed. Today felt heart palpitations again constant after doing a bit more effort than normal. I started researching about type of diabetes and found that most of my symptoms hit with Diabetes, and no doctor so far thought of asking examining glycosylated hemoglobin, or others who can attest to the diagnosis of diabetes. As yet no one has asked this exam I can only think it is diabetes, but maybe I have mounted a hasty diagnosis according to my symptoms. Maybe it's not diabetes, have to ask my guide with a doctor to get tested. I remember having my glucose measured on ultrasound of the abdomen in the hospital, and I was 8h of fasting and measured my blood sugar that was nothing less than 116 As usual fasting is between 70 and 99 Last night 45min after having eaten measure my blood sugar at a pharmacy and gave 106, the pharmacist said that I had just eaten blood glucose was within normal limits, but this little machine is for those already diagnosed with diabetes to control the level of insulin, why do you need to diagnose the blood test for it fast, because there are days that high glucose does not. After a few minutes we went to the hospital again and measure gave 85 So not understand which machine was right but whatever. At the hospital yet decided a sample of blood to see glucose test gave 101 Then the doctor at the hospital said that at that moment I was fine, but that diabetes is not ruled out but would need to seek an endocrinologist. During these days I'm regulating the amount of candy I'm already not as bad as before. But I'm still not 100%. And feel arrhythmias. I wish a doctor could explain me this, give me a light so we can get the right diagnosis. If you need any extra information I will provide smoothly.",
