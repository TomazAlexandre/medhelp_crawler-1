            "answer": "No, that is still hypo. Many good endocrinologists will know this, but some doctors still rely on outdated values. TSH is a pituitary hormone and the thryoid should be treated by measuring FT3/FT4. TSH should be secondary.The question is, \"How do you feel?\" If you are having hypo symptoms, the doctor may need to raise your Levo (an FT4 drug). If your FT4 levels are fine, but your FT3 levels are low, then the doctor may need to add an FT3 drug like Cytomel.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "Unfortunately, so many of us get stuck with doctors who know more about treating diabetes than thyroid disease. That's what happened with me. My last doc only wanted to treat my TSH, even though I had many hypo symptoms. I had to beg her to raise my medication. We shouldn't have to beg for wellness.I switched endos using the below directory. I am VERY HAPPY with my new doc now! He treats the FreeT4/3 levels, and TSH is secondary.http://thyroid.about.com/cs/doctors/a/topdocs.htm:) Tamra",
