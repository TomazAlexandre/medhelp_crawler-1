    "question": "Hi,I donated platelets for the first time on Monday, and on Tuesday I noticed this crescent moon shadow in my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0 I went to the opthamologist today, and she determined I had a cotton wool spot in my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't have hypertension, diabetes or any of the other known causes, but started wondering about whether a possible low platelet count could have been the cause.\u00a0\u00a0 I didn't even mention the platelet donation to her as it didn't even occur to me it could be related for some reason.\u00a0\u00a0 Is it a possible cause?Thanks much.Jane",
