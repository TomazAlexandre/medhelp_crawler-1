            "answer": "kraysmom, as best I can find out, it appears that there are two possibilities for those antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0They are either related to causing your body to attack the beta cells which produce insulin, or they are related to insulin resistance, which is more of a type 2 diabetes issue.\u00a0\u00a0The latter seems to be the most likely.It looks like the anti-bodies attach themselves to the insulin your body produces, which makes them ineffective, which is the cause of type 2.\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe your daughter is on metformin, is she?\u00a0\u00a0If she is, that could be part of the problem, but I don't think you've ever said she is.\u00a0\u00a0The antibodies are a sign of a potential problem with insulin resistance, which isn't a good thing for a type 1 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I'd definitely follow up with your doctor on this issue.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
