Trust your doc to do everything to keep the baby safe. I just wanted to let you know you are in my prayers and wish you luck. Sorry I don't have any better advice.",

            "answer": "In the two years I have been a member here I have seen a large number of women deal with GD.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I didn't have to myself, so what I am going to tell you is second hand info, and only to the best of my recollection.\u00a0\u00a0I do know for certain that treatment has varied.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the ladies did control it with diet, others were on meds, some injection method (I think it was insulin).\u00a0\u00a0I cannot comment specifically on the drug you are on.\u00a0\u00a0I will tell you that every single one of those babies, and I do mean without exception was born healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, a very small group had other issues but it was not related to GD, nor do I believe it was related to the meds they were on.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes OB's will prescribe a class C drug to a pregnant women...for GD or other issues.\u00a0\u00a0It is all based on risk vs. benefit and typically babies progress and drug levels are closely monitored.\u00a0\u00a0I know it must be scary to be prescribed something that is considered Class C, but your Dr. must feel that what is probably a minor risk associated with the drug outweighs the issue of not having the GD under control.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, in my opinion, Dr's do not do a great job of explaining their thinking behind a prescription.\u00a0\u00a0I am a big believer in talking to the pharmascist.\u00a0\u00a0They are the experts on drug risks and interactions and seem to not mind taking the time explaining exactly what the risks associated with any particular drug are.\u00a0\u00a0I know this isn't exactly the best info, but I hope it helps a little bit.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your Dr. is working with you to ensure your baby is healthy and safe.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you well and am glad the GD is being brought under control. Good luck!!",

            "answer": "I developed gd at 14 weeks, did the diet, didn't help was put on insulin shots at 16 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Don't be afraid of insulin (just do the pen not the syringes).\u00a0\u00a0In Canada they don't do glyburide so we do insulin more readily I think.\u00a0\u00a0 Insulin was easy and doesn't cross the placenta (If I recall).\u00a0\u00a0 Good Luck, there's also a pregnancy with diabetes medhelp board, those ladies are really helpful and most of them live in the usa so they are familiar with the drug you are on.My baby was born early (combination small for gestational age, high bp and possible placenta degradation (due to gd) but fine. Don't worry.J",

    "question": "i am 32 weeks pregnant and have a bunch of problems with my pregnancy. i am interested in any feedback with the gestational diabetes...my first pregnancy i tested negative for GD.my second pregnancy i failed the test and had to do the 3 hour one and it came back negative.this pregnancy i tested around week 27 and failed so i did the three hour and it came back negative.around week 30/31 i went in for my weekly check and they always test my urine and this time there was a large amount of sugar showing up in the urine. so my doctor had me do the 3 hour test again and it came back positive.i have been checking my blood sugar levels for 5 days now and went in yesterday to get ultrasound and meet with the doctor. the baby at 32 weeks is already 6 pounds and the technician was like WOW...your baby has a huge wide head and her stomache is wide with fat rolls.(so of coarse i am worried cause she made it sound freakish).then i saw the doctor and apparently my levels after a modified diet were still too high. he put me on glyburide 2x daily and i will go back on thursday to see if its working. of coarse i went and googled the medicine and i landed on all these websites where its a category C and not safe during pregnancy. my doctor explained that the baby is large on the outside but the insides (lungs) can be underdeveloped with diabetes. i know gestational diabetes can happen to a number of women during pregnancy...but anyone i knew who had it was able to control it with their diet. my doctor was most concerned because my highest level everyday was when i wake up in the morning and check after a fast. theres nothing to be modified...and food has nothing to do with it. i am curious if there are any women out there who are in the same situation or know of anyone who took the glyburide and baby was fine? i am just letting my nerves get to me. it doesnt help my sister in laws close friend who had diabetes during pregnancy found out week 32 her baby was gonna be born with out an eye...i know thats an extreme and rare case but you know how we let our nerves get to us.any feedback would be greatly appreciated!",
