            "answer": "I am. I wanted a vbac but i live in Florida and i have United healthcare. The worst insurance. All the doctors covered under my insurance will not do it because of liability reasons. I had a c section with my first baby, so Florida makes you automatically have another c section. But i have a condition that will be affected if i try a vbac. So im happy with the c section. May 22nd can not come fast enough",
