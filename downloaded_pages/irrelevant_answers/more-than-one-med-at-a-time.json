    "question": "I went to my family doc today. While I was at the neuro he said I needed to get on blood pressure meds.. so I followed up with him. I started on bp meds this evening. My vitamin D level was also low on the spinal tap, so I started on that. I also decided to start on an anti depressant. I am feeling a overwhelmed and need to get over this hump...I wanted something for fatigue, but he wants me to try all of this first with the avonex... he and the pharmacist said that I can take them together.",
