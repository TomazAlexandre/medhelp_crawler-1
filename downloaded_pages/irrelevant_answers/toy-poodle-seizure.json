            "answer": "This is rather worrying. My first thought, even before you mentioned the blood result, was diabetes. The high-blood sugar rather confirms it, though there are other things that are possibly linked to this result. Did your vet not say he needed to investigate the high-blood-sugar level?If he didn't say anything about it - go to another vet NOW. Don't leave this beyond today. It could very quickly turn into an emergency situation.Seizures are very common in diabetic hypoglycemia, when the diabetes has gone completely out of control. It is just possible this could be a nervous system issue, but the first priority is to find out why the blood glucose level is high - and then work on a diagnosis from that point.Tony",

            "answer": "I agree w/Tony.....Something is very wrong here!!! Go to the first clinic and get a copy of her blood panel if you don't already have one.....This will save you from the expense of another one at another Vet....Ask around at work or anywhere you can TODAY for a GOOD Vet in your area.....You need to get her somewhere today...This has gone on too long!!!My first thought is a herniated disc in her cervical (Neck) area, but it would not explain the seizure....The hurting to jump down is an indicator of BACK PAIN!She also needs to be on an anti-inflammatory to rule out pain.....This would at least give you a clue of the issue, unrelated to the seizure....Please, come back and let us know any new information.....By chance, has she just been vaccinated?? Just curious....Again, let us know....Thanks & good luck",

    "question": "I have a 5 year old female (not spayed) toy poodle. She had been acting weird a few days ago. She was really lethargic (wouldn't get up, had to be carried up and down stairs) and would yelp whenever she jumped down off the couch or bed. The other night I heard her fall down the stairs and I discovered her seizing at the bottom of the stairs. It lasted about 2 minutes and she came out of it. She had a couple of other small episodes where she tightened up and urinated but didn't fully seize. Once I got her to the vet, they did blood work and found her blood sugar was high- but nothing else amiss. The vet had her walk around and we discovered she wasn't using her right front leg and was having difficulty keeping balance. The doctor said it wasn't an injury from the fall, but something in her brain. The vet gave me antibiotics for a possible middle ear infection or encephalitis.Now, it's been nearly 36 hours and my dog is still out of it. I mean, she won't get up. I have to carry her outside to use the bathroom and coax her into eating. She does eat willingly, however. She will only raise her head to look around aimlessly and won't make eye contact with anyone. I don't know what to do. Is it something worse? Did she have a stroke? When will she be herself again? She was always the craziest, run-around, cat chasing type of dog. What can I do to help her? I read it takes 24 hours for a dog to come out of the post-seizure state, can it take longer?",
