    "question": "Please refer to article from Medline \"Cyclo-Oxygenase- and Capsaicin-Sensitive Afferant Febres Affect Beta-Adrenoceptor-Evokeked Response in the Rat Urinary Bladder\" key word: NSAIDs Tucci (author), Indimetacin.Ok, after taken 1000 mg (never had this dose level before) of Ibuprofen, I had began to experience frequent urination that night.\u00a0\u00a0Not realizing a possible connection, I took the same dose again the following day and 3 celebrex (1 day dose)during that week.\u00a0\u00a0Problem with frequent urination continues six weeks later.\u00a0\u00a06-7x a night at minimum. Problem also during the day.I should note that I have been previously diagnosed as having tight bladder neck muscle, so I generally did not empty my bladder in tests (assume it was 1/2 full).I understand correlation vs. causation.\u00a0\u00a0Having said that I believe it is possible that the the Ibuprofen/Celebrex (3% or more in pure form is excreted in urine (who knows what effect the metabolites still have) stayed in the urine in my bladder for undue time and is the cause of my current problem.\u00a0\u00a0Explain to me why this is not a possible cause (that is damage was done to the beta-adrenoceptors) or some other damage was done.",
