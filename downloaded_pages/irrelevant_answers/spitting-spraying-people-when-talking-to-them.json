            "answer": "Hi, there is an entity called \u2018gleeking\u2019, where the person compresses on submandibular salivary gland until a stream of saliva is released. This is then focused on a target. Many people experience unintentional bouts of gleeking whenever they yawn deeply or consume hard candy. This is voluntarily practised. The tongue protects others from the effects. Like this you can practise to obtain control of the salivary flow, try to block it with the tongue and keep swallowing the excess frequently. Check with a dentist to see if he can offer any suggestions. Regards.",
