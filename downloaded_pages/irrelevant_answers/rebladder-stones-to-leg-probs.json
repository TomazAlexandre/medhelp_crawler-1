I would\u00a0\u00a0have it looked at to be sure.Lars, my 4yr male had stones last year. They put him on antibotics for the infection, but also on Hills CD. He had to eat the food for 3 mos. The stones did dissolve from the change in diet. If they had not, they would have had to operate to remove them. At the time he was also testing borderline for diabetes. Also, contributed to diet.
