            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Evening rise in temperature is generally due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis.Many a times SGOT (AST) and SGPT (ALT) (both are collectively called transaminases) rise without any cause. Because AST is found in many other organs besides the liver, including the kidneys, the muscles, and the heart, having a high level of AST does not always (but often does) indicate that there is a liver problem. For example, even vigorous exercise may elevate AST levels in the body. However to reach at that conclusion the medical causes of these raised transaminases have to be ruled out. Causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. Steatosis and cirrhosis are ruled out by the ultrasound. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia and thyroid disease, can also cause liver transaminase elevations. Most liver diseases are characterized by greater ALT elevations than AST elevations except cirrohsis and alcohol abuse.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "I think this is worth looking into. I am currently 1 year and 7 months into whatever is going on with me. I got sick and it has been plaguing me ever since jan 3rd, 2008, have had a non-stop fever along with numerous symptoms. I am currently being monitored by an infectious disease specialist. Ask your doc if it might be a good plan to get a referral to see one.. i think if it was bad enough to get admitted in a hospital then it's worth looking into.. how long has this been going on? few weeks? i know they will be curious to what is going on, could be a viral thing going on, bug bite or something making your immune system react. Good luck to you, let me know how things go. Take care. sincerely, Elizabeth.",

    "question": "Hi:Today is the 15th day when I have been having mostly night fevers. For the first 6-7 days it would start at about 6 pm and rise upto 102 at about 3 am.I was first put on paracetomol\u00a0\u00a0for 7 days. I was then put on a dose of antibiotics for 3 days and then was admitted to a hospital, where all my tests were conducted.\u00a0\u00a0My hospital doctor stopped the antibiotics as she felt she did not know what exactly was being targeted by the antibiotic. All my tests were normal - except that SGOT and SGPT levels were raised -\u00a0\u00a082 and 113 resp. My fever also started to ebb (99 at night) and\u00a0\u00a0I was subsequently discharged. However, even after my discharge, the low grade fever returned ( 99 at about 7 pm going upto 100 at about 3 am). Today my SGOT and SGPT levels are 83 and 168 resp. What do you feel is the cause and by when do you feel the fever would subside and should any further tests be conducted?",
