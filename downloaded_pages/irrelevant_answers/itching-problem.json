            "answer": "Mr. Joseph:Some people get itchy hives after exercise or hot showers, but there are no diseases I know of which itch only on half the body after jogging.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect that now that this pattern is established, your mind is playing trick with you.\u00a0\u00a0The way to break this kind of itch-scratch cycle is to apply a lotion like Prax or Sarna (both OTC) on all affected areas immediately after jogging.\u00a0\u00a0Repeat the application every time you get the urge to scratch.\u00a0\u00a0That should suppress the itch, which will over time be extinguished.\u00a0\u00a0If that fails, you can consulot a dermatologist, but I doubt that will be needed.Best.Dr. Rockoff",

What I do is ignore it as best as I can, otherwise if I scratch the itch it just gets alot worse, eventually after about 15 mins it goes away. I don't think its in the mind as suggestedGood luckAndy",

    "question": "I am healthy African male in America.\u00a0\u00a0Whenever I walk or jog a distance of about 1.5 miles, all parts of my body below my waist begin itching.\u00a0\u00a0I have been able to overcome it by simply moving on and avoiding the urge to scrach.\u00a0\u00a0But, the itching sensation is so irritating that it compels me to stop.\u00a0\u00a0Once I stop, however, the itching dies down gradually.\u00a0\u00a0Also, all hell brakes as soon as I begin to scrach.\u00a0\u00a0I can ride my bike for 20 miles and I do not have this itching sensation.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be caused by the impacting of my feet on the ground during jogging or walking briskly?Thanks.",
