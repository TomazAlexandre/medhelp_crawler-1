    "question": "About a month ago I punctured a finger on my left hand. It got a infection which did not have pus or hurt much. The finger tip felt numb and tingly. Red spots would bleed if I put pressure on. I also seem to have got a nail fungus. Now I have a burning sensation beneath the muscle of the left bicep which makes the muscle crampy. The finger looks fine but I feel sick. Could the infection have spread? I have had the tetanus shot 2 years ago. My doctor gave me Lamisil for the nail fungus. Should I also get a round of antibiotics just to make sure?",
