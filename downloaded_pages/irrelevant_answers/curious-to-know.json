            "answer": "Hi!I am not sure what weird feeling you have, but if it faint tremor like or a bug crawling like feeling then this can be due to very dry skin and disorders of thyroid gland. The other possibility is Morgellons disease often mimics scabies. The disease is believed to be caused by weak immune systems in people that have contracted the tick-borne Lyme Disease at some point in their life. It can also be a fungal infection like Tinea corporis. Hormonal imbalance due to polycystic ovary or any other cause could also be a problem.You have probably been investigated for diabetes, thyroid disorders, etc. Please discuss the other possibilities with your treating doctor. Take care!",
