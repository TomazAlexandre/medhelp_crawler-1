            "answer": "I would have no clue as to what \"a medium fry (single?) or \"3 Crystals\" are; fast food? That stuff is full of fat and carbs, not good for a diabetic or anyone actually. Candy bars? Cokes? Those are not appropriate food for a diabetic. What is the point of her taking medicine and then eating like that? None, her diabetes will only get worse. Also skipping meals is very bad for a diabetic; they can go very low and then when they eat get jacked up high.I notice you and not your mother are posting here. What is her commitment to caring for her diabetes? She needs to see her doctor and get a referral to a diabetic educator or a diabetic nutritionist and start taking care of her diabetes. It isn't about just popping a pill. Now the exercise is good, she's got that one down!",

            "answer": "1.) Such poor food choices and DOUBLE ditto everything Zoelula has stated.2.) If your mother stands 6 feet plus, normal body mass is between 155-205 lbs. Eating the above implies she is obese.3.) This is good but does she do this 3- 5 days a week at hours on end breaking sweat? Walking leisurely, strolling, meandering does not burn off excess glucose or fat.\u00a0\u00a0Start slow for 10 minutes to warm up your muscles then for the next 30 minutes walk like you're late for an appointment or to catch your airplane flight before it leaves you at the gate.",

            "answer": "Yes those are fast foods. My mom doesnt know how to eat right, And she is going to a doctor but she doesnt have insurance for the other. My dad had a stroke and is on diasbility, he was the provider for the family. Owned their own business and it took all their savings to live on before my dad got approved for disability. 2 years. ugh!!So I have been trying to get them to eat healthy. I dont have all the health problems that they do. I am overweight, but I eat healthier and exercise more. The doctor told my mom that if she dont lose weight and get her self in control she is going to die. Her glucose was up to 398 when I took her to hospital one night. How do I get my mom to eat healthier and better and get out of her unhealthy ways??????",

            "answer": "Unfortunately there isn't a lot you can do to convince someone of something they don't want to hear, and sometimes if you push too much they rebel. If the doctor's telling your mom she will die if she doesn't get under control didn't help, it's hard to know what will. All you can do is let her know you love her and worry about her. She needs to take the first step to start to take ownership for her own health. If you live together or spend a lot of time together, you can cook and serve diabetically healthy foods rather than going out for fast food or encourage her to come for a brisk walk with you.With your family situation another possibility is that she's suffering from Depression which could be making it even harder for her to take care of herself. That would be something for her to talk with her doctor about.",
