            "answer": "So sorry to hear about the stress you are having- and that you are not feeling well.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your a1c level is within normal limits- did your doctor mention any of your tests results not being within limits?\u00a0\u00a0Everything you are doing will help with any diabetes risk you may have, but it sounds like the symptoms you are having might be caused from something other then diabetes as all your test results seem to not point to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you are still feeling ill- call your doctor and see if they have some other thoughts!\u00a0\u00a0Hope that you are feeling better soon.",

            "answer": "I agree with the others that it doesn't appear that you have diabetes and stress management is important; however, I'd suggest that you ask your doctor to test your thyroid function, as well.Hypothyroidism can cause tiredness, along with high LDL and low HDL cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to check a list of other symptoms for hypothyroidism.The tests you need are Free T3, Free T4 and TSH.\u00a0\u00a0It would also be good to ask for thyroid antibodies, to determine if you have the autoimmune thyroid condition called Hashimoto's, which can cause symptoms, before labs actually go out of range.\u00a0\u00a0The antibody tests you need are Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOab) and Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb)...MH also has a Thyroid Disorders community you're welcome to check out for more information.",
