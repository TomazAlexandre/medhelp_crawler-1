            "answer": "Hi we just moved 2 weeks ago too. And I have a 3 1/2 old and 20 mos old so I know the stress. Plus we moved into a smaller home until my husband can fix the other rooms to be used. I would take one room/box a day and write lots of self notes. And accept the chairs until you are moved in. Which is hard to do I know.",

    "question": "So we just found out my husband's wages are being garnished. So now we have to move because its literally the cost of our rent and we were squeezing by with what we had. He doesn't want to file bankruptcy because it would cause up not to hbe able to get a house when in the time we wanted to and it will only take 13 months to pay it off. Im 33+3 weeks, im super stressed because my little girl will be here in 6 weeks. We also has a 4 year old boy. I dont know how to just relax since we have to move pretty quickly since we cannot afford rent and we are moving in with my mom and I have not lived with her in over 5 years. I know its going to be a change but I feel so stressed and overwhelmed because I cant seem to relax and get it off my mind. Any advice on how I could relax myslef",
