            "answer": "The echo results mean that you heart's pumping function is normal.If you were diagnosed with CHF, that may be due to what they call diastolic CHF (in simple works, your heart is a bit to stiff,\u00a0\u00a0maybe from high blood pressure, diabetes etc....). If you are young then the diagnosis of CHF is probably incorrect, since most of young people get CHF only if EF is down (or they have some very rare diseases).I hope that helps",
