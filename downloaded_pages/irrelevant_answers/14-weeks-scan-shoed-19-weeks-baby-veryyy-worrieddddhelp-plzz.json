            "answer": "I wouldn't worry to much. The baby could just be measuring bigger for her dates... or she could just be a few weeks further along than she thought. Some women still have a period even if they are pregnant. Or it could have been implantation bleeding and not a real \"period\". :)Congrats on the healthy baby!",

            "answer": "You're worried that she can not be 19 weeks gone because she first had sex after her wedding mid September and it hasn't been 19 weeks since then, right?What the ladies before have said is right...if the baby is healthy then she shouldn't worry too much but she must make absolutely sure the doc knows she is showing so big for her dates. Big babies are an early risk indicator for gestational diabetes.Gotta say it sounds from what you say about her religious beliefs that she is worried people (her husband?) will think she had sex before marriage. As long as it was with her husband, I think no-one will judge her, cos they are married now and I doubt anyone will bother to add up the dates.If, on the other hand she had sex before the wedding and it WASN'T with her husband, and there's a chance the 19 weeks is correct then yes, she has a problem. Her husband is probably gonna start to suspect something once he gets involved with the doctor's appointments and pre-natal classes and understands how far along she is.She needs to be honest upfront. Generally there is no way a baby of 14 weeks development shows up as 19 weeks without a very good and very unusual reason. Usually the date of conception has been miscalculated and your friend needs to think hard about that.....tell her Good Luck with the baby. Sounds a big healthy one at least!!",
