    "question": "Hi~I'm starting my 35th week and this morning had hot and cold shivers and eventually had diarrhea. I felt slight faint briefly and was short of breath, but after going to the bathroom and lying down I felt fine. I know the shortness of breath is the crowding of the lungs, as this has been happening for awhile. But, in your opinion ladies, should I be more concerned?I know this sounds stupid, but I had an appointment in the afternoon, and since I felt better and the heartbeat was strong, I didn't even bring it up. Now I feel really dumb...Thanks",
