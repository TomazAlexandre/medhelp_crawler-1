            "answer": "Diabetes insipidus can occur after brain surgery or trauma, and is usually self-limiting and resolves after days to weeks. In a minority it may persist, and produces the symptoms that you describe. There may be partial production of ADH resulting in some residual ability to concentrate urine. You should be checked for adrenal insufficiency as this also results in an inability to concentrate the urine and dizziness etc. Treatment for persistent is with DDAVP which can replace the effect of the ADH hormone. Perhaps an alternative blood pressure medication to HCTZ could be used as this will also interfere with your ability to concentrate urine. I would suggest an opinion from an endocrinologist to confirm the diagnosis of cranial diabetes insipidus versus other causes.Good luck",

            "answer": "I went to my\u00a0\u00a0GP because I am so tired from the lack of sleep because I am up 3-4 times/night voiding.\u00a0\u00a0I must admit that I am thirsty all the time- the issue is that I work 10 hour shifts and my profession does not allow me to satisfy my thirst as needed- and if I did- I couldn't run to the bathroom every hour. My electrolytes were normal but my urine osmolality was less than 1/2 of the lowest normal value.\u00a0\u00a0I really don't know what I should do. I have had to go without fluid before and my muscles start twitching, it becomes difficult for me to speak, my head hurts so bad and I am sick to my stomach.\u00a0\u00a0I also start to decompensate mentally.\u00a0\u00a0I become confused and irritable.\u00a0\u00a0I notice that the dizziness becomes more prominent the longer I go without fluid.\u00a0\u00a0I attempted to do the dehydration test- I was only able to go 4 hours without drinking because I was driving and I honestly couldn't have driven to the lab safely. My sodium level was only slightly elevated.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are:\u00a0\u00a0If my posterior pituitary enhances on MRI does that r/o DI?\u00a0\u00a0I am scared of a transphenoidal, and of taking DDAVP- .I did a 24 hour urine collection and had about 4L- I didn't take my hctz as to not skew the results. My doctor also told me he noticed that I have aniscoria of over 1mm difference R>L and my rt. eyelid droops.\u00a0\u00a0What could cause this?\u00a0\u00a0I am also not sure- but I might be having some seizures. Could high sodium levels cause this?\u00a0\u00a0I work full time and really can't be running to alot of different doctors.\u00a0\u00a0I know this is stupid but I really can't miss work either.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions? Thanks",

    "question": "I am a 38yo f who is s/p posterior fossa craniectomy 10/02 for right CPA arachnoid cyst fenestration.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to surgery had severe dizziness and occasional vertigo. The cyst was enlarging (post CT myelogram) and I had complete resolution of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Following surgery noticed galactorrhea and nocturia.\u00a0\u00a0MRI w/ pituitary sequence revealed microademoma approx 6 x 8.\u00a0\u00a0All hormone levels including prolactin normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have recently started experiencing vertigo and dizziness with urine output >3.5 liters/day.\u00a0\u00a0MRI in 3/05 normal with no evidence of cyst recurrence. I have hypernatremia if no access to fluid and become extremely ill very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0My question is are there varying degrees of DI? or could this be related to the skull base/retromastoid crani?\u00a0\u00a0I am able to concetrate my urine but become so ill.\u00a0\u00a0I thought that in DI concetration was not possible.\u00a0\u00a0I take Dilantin 400mg/day for 2 grand mal seizures.\u00a0\u00a0Levels are normal.\u00a0\u00a0Also take hctz for htn.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate direction as to what to do.\u00a0\u00a0Visual fields also ok.\u00a0\u00a0I do also have a pineal gland cyst which is loculated and not generally an issue.Thank you for your time",
