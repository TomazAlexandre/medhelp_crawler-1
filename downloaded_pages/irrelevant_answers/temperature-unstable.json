            "answer": "Hi,Each person has a different set body temperature that would be normal for him or her. Temperature below normal is called hypothermia, but what you have cannot be classified as such. If you have been maintaining the same temperature for quite some time, with no other symptoms, like weakness, hunger, cold intolerance and if the surrounding temperature is normal and you are comfortable, then there is nothing to worry.However, if you have any other discomfort and if this is a recent development, then you may visit a doctor.Regards,",
