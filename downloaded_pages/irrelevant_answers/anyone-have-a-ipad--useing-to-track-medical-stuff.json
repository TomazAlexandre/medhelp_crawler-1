            "answer": "Writing on here was a a long shot I know. Just figured if anyone was using specific apps it may give me a clue what works and what doesn't.I did find one that I sort of like 'osiriX HD'. It lets you load all of the radiology type pictures onto the iPad. I was messing with it because of some comments made on a recent radiology report. Trying to look for what they were talking about with my uneducated eyeballs. It is kind of nice because I can isolate those pictures snap a quick pic with the ipad. I've found it useful for those friends who what to know so they do some research on the net and then come to me with 'huh'. I showed one of my close friends the a pic I snapped this way and it proved to be an 'ahah' moment for him.But that got me to thinking about other medical records uses. Not finding many apps for the patient though, mostly for the Dr and clinical use.I did find one that at least acknowledges CM though! 'Medscape'Thanks everyone, sorry for the long delay in responding. Just for whatever reason a lot of subcrainial pressure and related ha lately. Way beyond what is normal for me. So trying to adjust. Pain Management I don't think is helping as the steriod injections are shooting my sugar sky high.None the less, thanks for your responses!CW",
