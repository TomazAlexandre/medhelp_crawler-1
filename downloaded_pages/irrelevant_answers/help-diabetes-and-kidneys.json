I am still trying to get my sugars under control I have been diabetic since 2006, I was seeing a Dr regularly until I move to Fla in 2009..ever since it has been hard without insurance..I am fighting to try to get some medical insurance through my state and it is very hard. I can not afford the insurance that is out there and since it is a pre- existing condition most insurance places charge more money because of it.. I also have a rare disease/disorder in my kidneys to where I get stones and reoccurring infections called Medullary Sponge Kidney.. could that also be a disability? I usually go to the hospital 1-3 times a year with huge stones that have to be surgically removed. as of right now I have quiet a few stones in each kidney..",
