            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The values are only marginally high. You will be surprised to know that emotional and physical stress both increase your white cell count. So your anxiety could be the reason for the high count. If you do not have anemia, low blood sugar, low blood pressure, diabetes or hypothyroid state, your weakness could be due to poor diet and stress or lack of proper sleep even. You can get a peripheral blood smear done for differential count and types of WBCs to rule out leukemias. However in leukemia the WBC count is generally very high.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
