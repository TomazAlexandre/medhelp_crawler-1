            "answer": "Having a fatty liver is never a good thing as it can lead to fibrosis and eventually cirrhosis. It is very possible for your liver to heal\u00a0\u00a0and for you to no longer be a candidate for liver disease through diet and cardio-vascular\u00a0\u00a0exercise. (In most cases weight loss)You should always consult your doctor before beginning any exercises. I hope this helps. Best wishes!Randy",
