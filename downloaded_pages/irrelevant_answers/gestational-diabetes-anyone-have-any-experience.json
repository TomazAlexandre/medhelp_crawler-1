            "answer": "i had gestational diabetes with all 3 of my pregnancies, and i found it quite hard when sugar cravings kicked in! I had to use an artificial sweetener for in my cups of tea, or in anything that required sugar. i also stayed away from white bread, biscuits, potatoes, basically all junk food! Good things to snack on were diet yogurts, and anything protein. I found that if i was really hungry i would make an omelette to fill me up and it wouldn't affect my glucose levels. I was able to diet control mine, so never ended up on insulin.",
