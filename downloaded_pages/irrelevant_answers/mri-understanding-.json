            "answer": "Dear AGGCAN,Did she ruled out Cushing's disease? The MRI can be normal in many cases of Cushing's disease. So, it is important for the endocrinologist to rule out that possibility. You also mentioned the prolactin was elevated (how high?).I will be gald to review your data and MRI free of charge if you want.Our address is:N-1049 Doan Hall,410 W. 10th AvenueWexner Medical Center at The Ohio State UniversityColumbus, OH43210thank you",

            "answer": "As a pituitary patient myself, I can affirm that pituitary issues can and do cause headaches and migraines.From my layman base of knowledge, asymmetry can mean there is a smaller pituitary tumor there. MRIs have 3mm cuts so if a lesion falls between the cuts (or the radiologist is not as familiar with pituitary), things can be missed.Dynamic scans are great as smaller lesions can be seen better with the intake of the contrast - if the tech is good.Is your doc a neuro-endo? Are you at a pituitary center?\u00a0\u00a0Do you get copies of everything? Have other hormones been tested? Other hormones can impact GH (and IGF-1).",

            "answer": "Your family doctor may not know how to order a dynamic MRI. It is best to get into a pituitary center so you get the testing you need on the other hormones you need.I can say the GHD and Cushing's can mimic each other. However in trying to post a note to you I noted that your interests are diabetes, osteoporosis etc. and so I would ask for further testing on Cushing's syndrome. It takes several sets of testing (there is no one test to rule it in or out) and a good doctor to interpret the testing properly.\u00a0\u00a0There is information in the patient forum under brain/pituitary tumors under the health pages.",

She ruled out that obesity/center weight has any link with low growth hormones at all. she is after to reduce weight, confused that how to reduce weight? non tolerance to exercise. I explained to her that in case MRI comes out with no tumor then you should do further testing like ferritin and genetic test,.She explained that TSH is not hormone of pituitary at all. for low TSH, does such opinion is worth to accept or not.\u00a0\u00a0she told that because I am taking synthyroid ,it is ok. does this can accept.Only opinion she explained is worth to accept that due to low testosterone ,my prolactin and FSH goes high , for high LH she told she is not worried for this, for cortisol low and DHEAS low she does not have any clue.She ruled out reason of center headache is of low growth hormones\u00a0\u00a0 does this is worth to believe.Please guide with your knowledge ,I know you can do.",
