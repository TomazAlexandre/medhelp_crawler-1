            "answer": "When I try to research this online, I see that renal failure, MS, cancer, diabetes, liver failure all can cause localized itching. I feel this itch mostly when I wake up and it doesn't occur all day, it's more of a spontaneous itch throughout the day. Thanks for all your help, I'm really looking forward to resolving this matter.",

    "question": "Hi Doctor,I went to Six Flags on August 17th and it was a very hot day, ever Since August 17th I\u2019ve been having severe itching in my right palm only in the area underneath my thumb towards the middle of my palm. I went to a dermatologist and she suggested that it was a blocked sweat gland and stated that it would resolve in a few days. A week later the itch got worse, there was what seemed to be a blocked gland under my skin so she took a needle and \u201cremoved\u201d the small tiny bump under my skin, the itching continued. It seems as though every time I feel the itch, my vein turns into a circular dark patch and goes away when the itching subsides. I\u2019ve used steroid creams and hydrocortisone creams with no relief. She than suggested that it could be liver related, ran a liver function and hepatitis test (all normal). She now thinks its nerve related and I could\u2019ve damaged a nerve but it\u2019s been almost three months now and the itching continues. This has really taken a toll on my life, stressing me out a lot. I\u2019ve had a CBC, liver panel, and test for HIV and STD\u2019s, x-ray of the hand and everything is negative/normal. What could this possibly be and how do I get rid of it? I have an appointment with the neurologist this Thursday hoping for answers. I\u2019m afraid this is something serious, but the rest of my body doesn\u2019t itch, only that one spot. Also I want to add that my hands aren\u2019t dry and I always moisturize with Avenno lotion. Do you have any idea what this could be??? In your medical expertise, does it sound like a symptom of an underlying disease or something serious??? Thank You.",
