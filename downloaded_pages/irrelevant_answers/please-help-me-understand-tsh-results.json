            "answer": "Thank you so very much for responding.\u00a0\u00a0For the TSH level on 1/12/09 of 0.521 the reference range was 0.450-4.500; the T4 reference range was 4.5 to 12.0 (his was 10.9); the T3 Uptake reference range was 24-39 (his was 3.3)and the Free Thyroxine index was 1.2-4.9 (his was 3.3).\u00a0\u00a0The labs of 3/10/09 that indicated a TSH of 0.050L show a reference range of 0.450-4.500.\u00a0\u00a0I thought that cutting him back to 175 mcg was a big change, but this just keeps happening.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms that he was exhibiting on the 300 mcg included tremors, very bad short term memory problems, his color was terrible (almost gray), so much so that the physician told him he \"looked sick.\"\u00a0\u00a0He had a stroke in February 2008 (slight stroke) and in July 2008 had to be hospitalized for panic attacks, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor at the mental health hospital said that she did not think his symptoms were indicative of a mental health problem but rather a medication issue (thus the thyroid medication issue came up\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0he was taking 300 mcg at that time).\u00a0\u00a0His internist then decreased the Levothyroxine gradually and he has done pretty well, but as time went on, they gradually kept increasing the Levothyroxine (based on labs).\u00a0\u00a0After having the labs drawn on 3/10/09 he went back to his neurologist who treated him for the stroke and she is the one who wanted labs drawn to check for Vitamin B deficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0He has an appointment with a neuropsychologist on Apr 10 for a comprehensive exam regarding his memory (I believe to check for Alzheimer's, etc) and that will be followed up with a trip to the neurologist again the following week.\u00a0\u00a0It is almost like a delay in memory issues.\u00a0\u00a0Another new issue is headaches - he used to never have headaches.\u00a0\u00a0He will start to speak and then it's like he can't get it out, or he will forget what he is going to say, but he always remembers it later (my mother had Alzheimer's and her symptoms were not like this).\u00a0\u00a0It is very frustrating because he takes so much medication as he is diabetic (takes Actos 30 mg and Glimepride 4 mg 2 times a day) has chronic pain issues from 3 previous back surgeries and fusion of his vertebrae (takes Lyrica 150 mg 2 x a day) and peripheral neuropathy; takesTriglide l60 mg daily; Vytorin 10/40 once a day; Plavix 75 mg daily; Avinza 90 mg ER CAP King daily for pain management; KLOR-Con 10 (potassium) daily; Digoxin 0.25 for his heart; Prozac 40 mg (prescribed after the mental health hospitalization last June); Indomethacin 25 mg and Topomax 50 mg twice a day (prescribed by the neurologist for the headaches).\u00a0\u00a0I realize that it must be hard for the Internist to manage everything based on all his medical problems, and we try to keep everyone on the same page (the internist who is the PCP, the mental health clinician, and the neurologist), but it seems to me that the problems always seem to worsen as the levels of the Levothyroxine are increased.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I had known about this forum long ago.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate so much your input.",

            "answer": "WOW!\u00a0\u00a0That is a whole lot to get your mind around.\u00a0\u00a0First, I think you should be canonized just for knowing all this...I am totally inept at commenting on a lot of this, and I suspect your PCP/internist is also.\u00a0\u00a0Drug interatctions are so complex...just two drugs and you have to wonder which is the culprit.\u00a0\u00a0How do ten interact?\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure no one knows.My mother had Altzheimer's also.\u00a0\u00a0At one point she moved into an adult care home.\u00a0\u00a0There was a woman there who was virtually catatonic...she flipped through a family album constantly without seeming to see it.\u00a0\u00a0At some point, and I have no clue how this happened or who instigated it, she got off all her meds.\u00a0\u00a0She turned back into her old self...read, put a bird feeder outside her window, got interested in stuff again, chatted with all of us.\u00a0\u00a0She eventually was well enough to move in with one of her children.So, what can I offer?\u00a0\u00a0I'd probably consider seeing an endo.\u00a0\u00a0S/he could manage both the diabetes and thyroid. Your PCP/internist is showing\u00a0\u00a0ignorance in adjusting your husband's levo dose so drastically. Going from 300 to 175 is not exactly what I'd call \"fine tuning\".\u00a0\u00a0My endo recently adjusted my dose by 6.5 mcg (yes, the decimal point does belong there), and it sent me for a loop.\u00a0\u00a0I hate to introduce yet another doctor, but feel it's necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Your PCP has no clue.Also, I'd try to eliminate as many non-essential meds as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Definitely not diabetes meds and thyroid meds, but maybe some of the others.Sleeplessness, panic attacks, etc. could all be due to overmedication on thyroid meds.\u00a0\u00a0It could be that once that is adjusted properly, some of the other meds would become unnecessary.We, on this forum (we're a bit odd!) seem to have a number of the cross-over symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Don't know if we're hypo or hyper or if it's the meds we're taking to counter the effects of the levo that cause some of our symptoms.Hope this is of some help...",

            "answer": "Get another Doctor to treat his thyroid conditionYour Husband does not have the classic symptoms of Alzeimers as I work (and have been trained and done accredited courses) with Acute Dementia and Alzeimers Residents in a nursing Home and know the signs.The brain scan would show up that the 'frontal lobe' would be damaged or 'dying off ' in activity if it was Alzeimers or early Dementia.There are many conditions that come under the 'trem' Dementia and Alzeimers is one of them.The headaches could be from the drastic drop or increase in the thyroid meds.Alzeimers does not cause headaches.Neither does any part of the frontal lobe of the brain deterioating cause headaches.In regards to Alzeimers, your Hubby would have 'stages' where he has an obsessive disorder.That is the first sign of early Alzeimers......An OCD that mimics a 'trigger ' in his brain.For example, he would start by 'undressing and dressing several times a day and folding his clothes up neat and tidy as if he was preparing himself for work the next day.He would also suffer from 'Sundowners'.This is where he is confused about what time to sleep and what time to be awake.\"Sundowners' (late afternoon period) also brings on aggression and causes frustration in the person.Believe me, if your Hubby had Alzeimers, you would know the early signs.Treatment of his thyroid is imperative as this would also stabalise his BSL (blood sugar levels).Your Hubby is in a Catch 22 situation where Doctors are blaming one condition on another.Sort each condition out and you will see a drastic improvement.I hope that helps you.Keep your chin up. x",
