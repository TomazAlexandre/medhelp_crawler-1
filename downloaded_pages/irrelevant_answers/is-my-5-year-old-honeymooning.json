            "answer": "I have been there!\u00a0\u00a0I took my duaghter to the doc. with pee issues when she was 2.\u00a0\u00a0Her BG was 350.\u00a0\u00a0Next time we took it several hours later it was 91.\u00a0\u00a0Once more it was 200 and then fine.\u00a0\u00a0At that time her A1C was 5.0 and fine.\u00a0\u00a0Fastforward, now she is 8.\u00a0\u00a0This past summer we started having problems again.\u00a0\u00a0Her fasting BG is elevated anywhere from 110 - 140, but not every day.\u00a0\u00a0Her post meal sugars are on the high side, too.\u00a0\u00a0But not every day.\u00a0\u00a0Some days she is fine. Her A1C has been taken three times in the past 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Twice it was 5.7%.\u00a0\u00a0I was told by one doctor ti was pre-diabetic and another it was perfectly normal. No answer for me there. THEN she started tanking 30 minutes after her meals. I am not sure why.\u00a0\u00a0Its very unsettling. Her A1C is now 5.3%.\u00a0\u00a0I suppose that her lows brought it down.\u00a0\u00a0I guess that is good?\u00a0\u00a0The doctors don't know why we are getting weird sugars and haven't really done anything.\u00a0\u00a0Since she is not really sick, they aren't interested in her.\u00a0\u00a0Yet I don't WANT her to be really sick.\u00a0\u00a0So, I kept pushing for them to find answers.\u00a0\u00a0FINALLY I think we figured things out... She saw a new endrocronologist last week because I kept pushing!\u00a0\u00a0They told me about\u00a0\u00a0MODY diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Mature Onset Diabetes of the Youth.\u00a0\u00a0Its rare and not very talked about. Its a genetic mutation and there are 9 different genes that can cause it, I think. Its highly hereditary.\u00a0\u00a0There is no family history of diabetes for us, which makes this even MORE rare.\u00a0\u00a0Testing for it is very expensive and so we won't be doing the testing. But everything still points to it.\u00a0\u00a0People can have the MODY gene and never be diagnosed with diabetes. I guess that is good.\u00a0\u00a0You can go your whole life and never get sick and never know you have this mutated gene.\u00a0\u00a0Some people get diagnosed with type 1 or 2 when they really have MODY.\u00a0\u00a0It can even be responsible for gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Interesting, right?\u00a0\u00a0They did a fasting glucose tolerance test and c-peptide test ( I think. I asked them to.\u00a0\u00a0not sure if they did) and they are checking for antibodies to rule everything else out.\u00a0\u00a0But I am pretty positive that will come back fine.\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe she has type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway... my point is there are more types of diabetes than type 1 and 2.\u00a0\u00a0So for your daughter maybe you caught her very early for type 1? and she is still having a honeymoon phase where the pancreas is still producing insulin.\u00a0\u00a0OR maybe you can bring up MODY diabetes at her next appointment and see what their thoughts are.\u00a0\u00a0For my daughter we are on a \"just watch her\" time.\u00a0\u00a0She may\u00a0\u00a0never get sick and just have these higher than average sugars for ever.\u00a0\u00a0OR she may get sick.\u00a0\u00a0I get to just wait and see.\u00a0\u00a0:-\\.\u00a0\u00a0But at least I know why... or at least PROBABLY why.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find answers.\u00a0\u00a0Not knowing *****.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep us informed.\u00a0\u00a0I am interested to see where this goes for you.",

    "question": "Late Nov, I took my 5 yr old dghtr to her pediatrician when she complained of stinging while urinating.\u00a0\u00a0Urine had sugar, finger poke was 252, one hour later, blood glucose normal.\u00a0\u00a0Same thing happend with glucose test--238 but one hour later, normal.\u00a0\u00a0A1c was 5.2 but more recently, was 5.5.\u00a0\u00a0C peptide was .2 but now is .3, after 12 or 13 hours fasting.\u00a0\u00a0We've been monitoring at home and all values normal with the exception of one brief spike to 184 following birthday party and candy immediately before (eating continuously hour or more up until.)\u00a0\u00a0Ipro results of one week's duration had only 2 postprandial excursions that were \"high\" but quite a few more that were \"low.\"\u00a0\u00a0Has symptoms at night that lead me to believe she's hypoglycemic, maybe reactive, and has never been thirsty or urinated often.\u00a0\u00a0She's caucasian, thin, active.\u00a0\u00a0We've seen endo nurse, but no endocrinologist yet as she doesn't yet meet criteria for Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Nurse thinks she's \"super, super early honeymooning.\"\u00a0\u00a0Is she?!\u00a0\u00a0Or could she have a pancreas tumor, infection, liver issue, or something?\u00a0\u00a0Could she be hypo but still briefly spike from time to time?",
