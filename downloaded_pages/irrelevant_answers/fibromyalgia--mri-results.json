            "answer": "I'm in a similar boat to you - have fibro but a lot of neuro changes - severe numbness/tingling/burning, muscle cramping, muscle 'vibrations' (sensory issues), trigeminal neuralgia, problems walking that come and go (usually once every 12-18 months I'll have a 'spell' that comes on and lasts for 1 week to a couple of months), periodic bladder urge incontinence (comes and goes with the walking stuff), vision issues, memory problems etc...Been worked up for MS, have several spots on the brain but they said it's not 'ms looking' and my spinal tap came back negative so I'm fine in that department. However they do think that there's something else going on, but have to see what develops over the years because they can't figure it out now.That all said, they're discovering more and more that fibro impacts neurological health way more than they thought. I constantly find others with fibro that have a lot of the\u00a0\u00a0burning/tingling/numb stuff and most have some pretty severe memory issues too. You could consider speaking to your doctor about an antiseizure drug such as gabapentin because I find a ton of relief in a lot of my 'nervy' stuff using them (otherwise the burning/tingling and the trigeminal neuralgia are enough to make me pull my hair out).Best of luck.",

    "question": "I am a 40 yr old female with PMH of fibromyalgia. I have had a lot of strange neuro symptoms the last few months: numbness, tingling, memory loss, migraines, blurred vision, severe depression, personality changes, etc... Was referred to a neurologist. Neuro exam quoted as \"normal\". Labs and MRI brain and c-spine orderd. Phone call from nurse two weeks later: Vit D was very low at 8.2. Was started on 50,000u 3x week for that. Was told that can cause a lot of \"weird neuro stuff\". Was told MRI was \"fine\". No follow-up appt ordered. Follow up with primary physician. Saw PCP the next week. He ordered MRI images and reports from the hospital. He is very concerned about MRI results. Wants me to see another neurologist. Here is what the brain MRI showed: \"Small punctate foci of abnormal signal in the deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres- most likely minimal old small vessel ischemic changes. Were not present on previous study in 2001. Two small 5mm diameter rounded structures are noted in the right and left parotid glands and most likely represent small lymph nodes. These are unchanged from previous study.\" I am only 40, have no history of hypertension, diabetes, CAD, etc. What does all this mean and should I be concerned for anything like MS or something like that?? I am very worried and confused. HELP!!!",
