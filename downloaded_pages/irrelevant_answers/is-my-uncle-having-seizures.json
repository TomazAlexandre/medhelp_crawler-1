            "answer": "Hi there.There is a condition called \"absence\" seizures (pronounced as absanz) where the person just stares blankly into space.\u00a0\u00a0However, this is more common in children and usually the person does not remember the things that went through during the spell.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest taking your uncle to a neurologist and have an EEG or an MRI done.\u00a0\u00a0This can point out if there is indeed a seizure focus that should be treated.\u00a0\u00a0On a background of diabetes, you may also want to have his sugar checked since high sugar levels may also affect consciousness (though not so much the kind that your uncle is having).Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Regards.",

            "answer": "Thank you for the response.\u00a0\u00a0He has been to 2 neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0When this first started happening he ended up going to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0He spent 3 or 4 days in the hospital and was assigned a neuro doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He had that I know of a catscan with no tumors seen.\u00a0\u00a0He had a brain MRI, an EEG, and a special heart monitor hooked up that recorded everything his heart did.\u00a0\u00a0When all was said and done they told him he was having seizures sent him home on a seizure medication and made him an appointment at the\u00a0\u00a0office.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor went out of town for several weeks and after starting the meds my uncle started having trouble with his hands being cold and the skin peeling bad.\u00a0\u00a0The spells continued also.\u00a0\u00a0He decided to make an appointment with another neuro doctor in another town.\u00a0\u00a0This doctor imediately told him after talking with him in the office that you always lose time(consciousness) with seizures.\u00a0\u00a0He ordered to the best of my knowledge a carotid ultrasound to check for blockage in his neck, another brain MRI, a tilt table test, and plain neck films.\u00a0\u00a0He also had my aunt to check his sugar during spells thinking it might be a fast drop in his sugar that then returned to normal has he came out of the spell.\u00a0\u00a0His sugar checked in the normal range and except one time it was low but not extremely.\u00a0\u00a0He told him that he had no blockages, a negative tilt table test and that is neck had some disc problems.\u00a0\u00a0My uncle told him that he bent over in church and had a spell and his neck hurt.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor then jumped on this as the cause and ordered a neck MRI.\u00a0\u00a0After the neck MRI he went to the neuro doctor and carried the neck MRI disc. The neuro doctor then tells him that is neck is stable enough it doesn't need surgery and to take some muscle relaxer he gave him and that he could start back driving and if work would put him on lite duty he could work.\u00a0\u00a0He said that straining his neck was causing the spell.\u00a0\u00a0I have witnessed these spells when my uncle was laying in the bed not moving.\u00a0\u00a0He tried to explain that he did only have spells when he strains himself but it didn't sink in with the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I presonally think the doctor decided he didn't know what was wrong.\u00a0\u00a0My uncle will not drive because his doesn't want to hurt anyone and there is no lite duty at work.\u00a0\u00a0Now he thinks his neck is the problem so he taking the neck MRI to a neck surgeon for an opinion.\u00a0\u00a0From what I have found on the internet I was thinking that he his possibly having a simple partial seizure of some type.\u00a0\u00a0My problem is that I don't know if the first doctor found something on the tests to acctually indicate seizures or if he just took that course of treatment because the symptoms pointed in that direction and he coundn't find anything else wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry I am long winded but if my uncle doesn't find out what is wrong soon and treat it correctly he could lose his job.\u00a0\u00a0Any help you can give is appreciated.",
