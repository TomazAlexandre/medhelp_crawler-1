            "answer": "Your blood pressure is far too high.\u00a0\u00a0The blurry vision could be due to the high blood pressure and you will also no doubt be feeling dizzy when you stand up.\u00a0\u00a0The high blood pressure will be causing the pressure in your head.Blurring vision can also be caused if the sugar levels in your body are too high.Make an appointment to see your doctor so that he can monitor your blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0He may do this over a short period of time before he decides whether you should be prescribed with blood pressure medication.\u00a0\u00a0 A blood test\u00a0\u00a0(HBA1C) would also show whether your sugar levels are too high and whether you have diabetes.In the mean time, eat regularly (not junk food, cakes and sugar foods) and drink plenty of water so as not to get dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Cut down on your intake of salt and salty foods - salt does increase blood pressure.Try and do some relaxation techniques to help you to relax.\u00a0\u00a0Get help to hope with the stressors in your life and how to deal with them.\u00a0\u00a0Stress is another factor that will spike up your blood pressure.Your doctor can help you with this, by prescribing something to help you to calm down in stressful situations and also refer you to a specialist counsellor to help you to how to tackle your problems.Going out for a walk in the fresh air is a good way to get calm.\u00a0\u00a0This won't make the stressors go away, but will help you to calm down and see things from a different angle.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Salt never increased my blood pressure and I used to add plenty of salt to taste everything as zinc deficiency affected my taste and smell. Salt may cause high blood pressure for those who are salt sensitive perhaps.",

            "answer": "You are very lucky that you do not have hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0It is probable that you did not over exceed on your salt intake.I too love lots of salt.Many years ago after having eaten a lot, and I mean a lot of home made gherkins that were pickled in brine (brine is salt and water) my blood pressure did go up drastically even though I am on medication for hypertension.The medical profession usually tells people with hypertension and fluid retention to cut down on the amount of salt.\u00a0\u00a0There is also lots of evidence to prove that too much salt intake is not good for our bodies.I have copied and pasted the link below that explains in detail about salt and about studies that have been carried out with regard to health risks with regard to consuming too much salt.\u00a0\u00a0The web page has no copy write logo and is not selling anything.Unfortunately, a lot of foods that we buy do have hidden salt and sugar and we cannot calculate correctly how much salt intake we do have in a day.\u00a0\u00a0Our body does require some salt, but too much is not safe.http://www.actiononsalt.org.uk/salthealth/factsheets/pressure/index.html",

            "answer": "Yeah I went well over the salt intake. I don't eat the refined table salt but rock salt. I recently just bought himalayan pink salt to try.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure has only gone up with magnesium deficiency and hyperthyroidism.An interesting article is Real Salt is GOOD for you! Here is a few paragraphs...\"And in this study[9] the risk for heart disease was 56% higher for the low-salt group than for the group who ate the most salt. Wow.And then we find a lot of studies linking salt restriction to increased LDL and triglycerides[10], insulin resistance[11], type 2 Diabetes[12] and sodium deficiency[13]. Cutting back on salt is not sounding so good now, really is it\u2026Another interesting point to consider is that critically ill patients in hospital who cannot eat or drink are given a drip containing saline to keep them healthy. A standard 2 litres of 0.9% saline every day equates to 18 grams of salt which helps sick people get better without any negative effect on their blood pressure (even heart patients!), but apparently 6 grams of salt (or 3.75 grams for some) for the healthy people on the street is somehow dangerous?\"",

            "answer": "Mmm very interesting about the pink Himalayan salt.\u00a0\u00a0I have not seen this in the supermarkets in the UK, may be they will be in the health shops!I shall keep an eye out for that as I wouldn't mind trying it out if it is any good.I use normal table salt and I know that contains something (may be powder of some sort) to keep it to flow freely.Well my diabetes (I now have Type 2, I was glucose intolerant for about 6 years), certainly wasn't anything to do with me having lack of salt :)Even when I was not allowed any salt when I was in the maternity ward 40 years ago and the food was so bland, I got my husband to sneak me in some salt.\u00a0\u00a0(I had a lot of fluid retention at the time, can't remember if my blood pressure was raised or not at that time).With sick people it is slightly different.\u00a0\u00a0When people are ill and do not eat and drink, they become dehydrated and have loss of electrolytes.\u00a0\u00a0Salt is one of the minerals that our body does require, but not a lot.\u00a0\u00a0And as you will probably be aware, dehydration can lead to death.You will probably know of the electrolyte replacement drinks that can be purchased when someone has severe sickness and diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0These have a balance of salt and sugar to replenish what has been lost.To be honest, a lot of people are probably consuming a lot more salt that is required for the body and what is recommend as being the safe level.\u00a0\u00a0Unless you buy and make your own meals, ready made stuff, condiments like pickles, sauces contain salt, and then there are the crisps and snacks that contain salt.If we consume a lot of salt the body will compensate by making us feel very thirsty which will make us drink more and that no doubt will help to flush out the excess.\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever experienced that?\u00a0\u00a0Same goes for sugar if someone is glucose intolerant or has diabetes, if you consume too much sugar, you will feel very thirsty.I would be interest to know what you think of the pink Himalayan salt.\u00a0\u00a0Why is it pink?\u00a0\u00a0Is this it's natural colour or it is dyed to be pink as a novelty?Like the saying goes \"Everything is good for you, in moderation\".",

            "answer": "Commercial table salt is chemically cleaned, bleached white, heated at high temperatures, stripped of all its minerals (besides sodium and chloride) and the taste is inferior to real salt.\u00a0\u00a0When I tasted rock salt...wow the flavour is amazing. Can't go back to boring table salt! :)Himalayan salt is a rock salt and there are various natural hues of pink, red and white which are an indication of the varying mineral and iron content. The pink in Himalayan salt comes from iron oxides.\u00a0\u00a0I've read the pink salt contains 84 minerals. I purchased this salt recently at a local market but it's available at health food stores.I've had severe insulin resistance from eating too much refined white sugar. I developed pre diabetes from hyperthyroidism. I've reversed both conditions. You might be interested in an article from Dr Hyman: \"5 Steps To Reverse Type 2 Diabetes and Insulin Resistance.\"\u00a0\u00a0I was thirsty with insulin resistance which worsened with pre diabetes but was far worse with\u00a0\u00a0severe magnesium deficiency.I had magnesium deficiency from insulin resistance/pre diabetes but worsened the deficiency after surgery (any type of stress lowers magnesium) and high doses of vitamin D (I couldn't raise my vitamin D or calcium until I corrected my magnesium deficiency). A good article to explain about magnesium and vitamin D: \"Know the Importance of Taking Enough Magnesium with Your Vitamin D).\"\"Magnesium deficits and increased urinary magnesium excretion can occur in people with insulin resistance and/or type 2 diabetes [24,25]. The magnesium loss appears to be secondary to higher concentrations of glucose in the kidney that increase urine output [2].\" - NIH - Magnesium.",

            "answer": "Thanks Red_Star, you certainly have sold me on to Himalayan pink salt.I shall see if I can get some through Amazon (I hate town shopping).Unfortunately, in the UK the doctors do not test for magnesium and Vitamin D deficiency as a norm.\u00a0\u00a0But I have taken these as supplements in the past and one doctor said that none of them will help me.\u00a0\u00a0They don't routinely check for vitamin and mineral deficiencies in the blood which is a shame.Glad that you have managed to be able to sort out your health problems.Best wishes.",
