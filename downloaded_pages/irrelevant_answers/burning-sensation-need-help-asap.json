            "answer": "Hello,Recurrent thrush infection can also cause such symptoms. There are some reasons for recurrent thrush infection. These include when symptoms may not be due to thrush, when thrush is caused by other strains of Candida spp. such as Candida glabrata( These may not be so easily treated with the usual anti-thrush medicines), you are taking antibiotics, or if you have undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes.You should get a fungal culture of vaginal discharge done and all these causes ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
