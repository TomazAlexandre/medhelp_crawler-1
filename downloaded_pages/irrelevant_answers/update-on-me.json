    "question": "So after 5 long weeks of hospital bed rest i finally got home last night!!!!!!!! I am still on bedrest, only allowed up to pee and shower until i reach 34 weeks. The Dr was going to keep me in the hospital and move me to independent stay. i was still going to be on bedrest, but i would not have nurse care.I didn't think i could handle that. it was getting harder and harder being there and the thought of not even seeing a nurse throughout the day was too much. So she did the ultrasound (aftger saying she would have to postpone until the next day, but when a spot came up she did me since my mom was there)When she finished with a tv u/s and my cervix had stayed the same she said \"i guess you're going home\"!!!!! I live about 1 hour away from that hospital, so if i go into labour before 36 weeks i have to go there, after 36 i an deliever at my local hospitalMy ges. diabetes is being controlled pretty well. i do have to keep adjusting my insullin being on bedrest and all, makes it harder to control. and the baby is right on track with size/weight (45th precentile) which makes me happy because i was worried about him getting to big.",
