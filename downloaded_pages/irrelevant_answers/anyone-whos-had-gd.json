    "question": "Okay, I just got a call from my OB's office and I failed my 1 hr glucose test. So now I'm worried that I may have GD. I am going back for the 3 hr test this Friday and hoping everything comes back normal this time but I would like to get an idea of what having Gestational Diabetes entails. What kind of special precautions or course of action will my dr be taking? What will I have to do to ensure that my baby is okay? I just want to be prepared to do all that I can, no matter what it is, to make sure my baby's kept out of harm's way. Any information on the subject will be greatly appreciated. Thanks.",
