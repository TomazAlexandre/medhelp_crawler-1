            "answer": "There have been many write-ins about this terrible complication that some type 1 diabetics suffer from. Here are some websites that may offer some support and information:http://www.g-pact.org/http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/gastroparesis/The second site is for a Yahoo support group for gastroparesis sufferers. Perhaps this kind of chat possibility will be of help to you.Another suggestion I want to make is to send your daughter to the jdrf.org website so she can contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST) for one-on-one support. We have volunteers who have experience with this complication and would match her directly with one for personal support and information. When the home page loads, she should click on the link on the left side of the page for the ODST and then simply needs to fill out the form with her request and send it to us. A response should be sent within 48 hours of her request being entered.Meanwhile, all of you other folks out there who suffer from this complication or who have loved ones who suffer from it, please check in here and give Kristy's mom some support. I hope we end up with a lengthy message thread on this one.",

            "answer": "Hello again,Your daughter is fortunate to have a champion mom helping her along the way.\u00a0\u00a0To find/start a Gastro support group in your area, perhaps you can contact your local chapter of JDRF.\u00a0\u00a0Those folks often have great connections to the medical professionals who specialize in diabetes care -- and those folks often are willing to come to a group meeting to offer information, tips from the field, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Having the pro's there is very important so that a support group CAN offer support.\u00a0\u00a0The group members will have enormous amounts to share from their daily struggles and victories with this most unkind complication.Good luck and let us know how the support group initiative works out!",

The road traveled down w/gastroparesis has not been an easy one. None of the meds have worked for me and I feel pretty ill most days.\u00a0\u00a0Not many people understand gastroparesis except for those going thru it also.\u00a0\u00a0I am now on social security disability because of it....I am just to ill with it.\u00a0\u00a0I sincerely hope that your daughter finds a support group, I haven't found one here but I should look harder. I sincerely wish her all of the best and that she will be able to fight this better than I have been able to. Its scary to go thru == let her know she's not in it alone.",
