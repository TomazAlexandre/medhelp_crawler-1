            "answer": "May I assume your are talking about Ejection Fraction?I believe the normal range is 55-70%, so 25% is very low.As to your question, I'd guess one with an EF of 25% would have very limited physical endurance, or ability to engage in physical activity.\u00a0\u00a0While I do not know, I assume one can survive with a low EF if they limit their muscle activity, their need for oxygen.",

            "answer": "Hi Jerry,Yes Yes I mean Ejection Fraction. I am 72 years old. I had by-pass surgery in December 2005. Prior to the surgery EF had gone down to 30% and after the surgery it had increased to 55%. I May 2009 I had sudden ischaemic cardiac pain and was hospitalized. Thereafter 2D Echo showed EF reduced to 25%. I am advised rest. I do not have any physical activity. I want to know how EF can be increased?Regards,K.N.Motta.===============================================================",

            "answer": "Got a little feedback. It seems that meds, low sodium diet and exercise (as approved by your doctor) can all help with heart health. Meds seem to be #1. Not sure which you are taking. Low sodium is critical. There's some debate about exercise. It may not directly improve EF but it strengthens the leg muscles which probably help with overall circulation back to the heart.",

            "answer": "Those were the only 3 things they've mentioned that seemed to have helped their EF's. Most are on Coreg (carvedilol). One also takes Ranexa which has seemed to help with the collateral blood vessels and thereby easing the angina.Looking at your message, your EF may have dropped just since the ischemic event this past May. It will take time for the medications to ease the burden on your heart. You might want to talk to your doctor about cardiac rehab, working some activity/exercise into your daily regime. See if he'll agree to that since it's monitored. I think you're way too young to sit back in a rocking chair and wait. . .",
