            "answer": "Because of the potential for side effects and interactions with medications, you should take dietary supplements only under the supervision of a knowledgeable health care provider.Talk to your doctor before taking more than the recommended daily allowance of selenium. Although doses for some conditions are 200 mcg, there is some evidence that this amount could increase your risk for diabetes. Do not exceed the tolerable upper limit of 400 mcg. Over time, high doses of selenium can be toxic. Side effects include fingernail loss, skin rash, fatigue, irritability, and weight loss.People who have an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) or have had, or are at risk for, skin cancer should not take selenium without talking to their doctor. High selenium intake may increase the risk of diabetes and high cholesterol.",
