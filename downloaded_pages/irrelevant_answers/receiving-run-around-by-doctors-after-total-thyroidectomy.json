            "answer": "Sorry to hear about the run around. I've been dealing with a lot running around myself. I ended up going to a new endocrinologist. I can have sympathy for you as far as trying to get past the \"girls\" at the reception desk. It's nearly impossible these days to directly speak to your doctor without an appointment. Try being firm and persistant with them and if it doesn't work maybe it's time to change to a more caring doctor's office.",

            "answer": "Sounds like symptoms of hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Once you are at the right levels for YOU, symptoms should subside, however, it takes time heal thereafter.\u00a0\u00a0 Two months is not long enough for the body to heal.\u00a0\u00a0After that, if you are not satisfied with doctors, can you fire them? and find one who IS willing to work with you?\"psychiatrist\" how insulting! Fire him!Keep in mind that fiber diet can interfere with thyroid med. absorption and influence levels. If you are going to be on that type of diet, be consistent.Sharp stomach pain and diarrhea I have no clue, but, and including the high BP, could be stress from all the doctors. Fire them! ;)\u00a0\u00a0I feel for ya!Good Luck!",

            "answer": "I got the \"psychiatrist\" referral after giving birth with a now defunct HMO.\u00a0\u00a0The delivery was horrible and my colon ended up being perforated.\u00a0\u00a0When the doctor suggested a psychiatrist I informed him that psychiatrists deal with the wrong end and let him know what I thought of his credentials and his HMO.I've fired a few doctors and it sounds like you have two you need to fire.\u00a0\u00a0Please get a referral to another endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any friends who are seeing one or is there a support group you could ask?\u00a0\u00a0Patients are great judges of doctors.I'm wondering if your stomach/intestinal problems could be IBS.\u00a0\u00a0Stress and hormonal imbalances (um . . . like having your thyroid removed) can really set IBS off.GravesLady hit it right on the head - thyroid levels need to be correct for YOU, not just to please some lab.\u00a0\u00a0You sound hypo.\u00a0\u00a0Are you also cold and tired all the time?Another thing that can block thyroid medication absorbtion is calcium.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you don't have ANY calcium for a couple of hours before or after your thyroid medication.\u00a0\u00a0Are you *ON* any thyroid medication?\u00a0\u00a0If not, you probably should be.It can take the body months to level out after thyroid surgery and since yours was only over two months ago you probably haven't stabalized.\u00a0\u00a0Even if your labs are \"normal\" now they might NOT be soon.Do some doctor shopping and quickly!!!",

            "answer": "One thing I forgot to mention.\u00a0\u00a0Following TT two sisters and I developed diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had your blood sugar levels checked?Diabetes *could* be tied to your weight gain, blood pressure problems, and your flu-like symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't have a glucose monitor, see if you can borrow one (change the needle though!), or buy one.If you are having blood sugar issues you'll need to control your carbohydrate intake.\u00a0\u00a0The best diet for that is the one from the American Diabetes Association but Atkins or South Beach are pretty close (South Beach seems to be healthier, especially if you are having blood pressure problems).Hang in there and find a good endo - endos handle blood sugars as well as thyroid problems so mention the weight gain, blood pressure, and flu-like symptoms.",

    "question": "I underwent a total thyroidectomy on 8-21-06.\u00a0\u00a0(I had severe hyperthyroidism before the surgery).\u00a0\u00a0The surgery went fine, but I started having flu-like symptoms one week after the surgery that have not subsided.\u00a0\u00a0The skin on my face and neck is also now very dry and itchy, as well as on my entire upper body.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also experiencing sharp stomach pains and diarrhea about 4 days a week, have gained 20 lbs in the two months since the surgery and my blood pressure is now pretty high, 153/96.I had an appointment with my primary care for these symptoms two weeks ago, where he simply advised me to use moisturizer regularly and to eat more fiber in my diet, then see him back in two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0He ended the appointment by telling me if I felt I could not return to work on Nov 1st, he would have to arrange for me to see a psychiatrist.\u00a0\u00a0I was floored.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not crazy, I'm just feeling like **** physically!!Today, I called the endocrinologist who treated me before the surgery to make an appt with him to discuss my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0His assistant just referred me back to my primary care, pending a call back from the endocrinologist, stating that since my current blood work shows my thyroid levels now in the normal range, (they are, but just barely), I have to go through my primary care doctor for treatment of my current symptoms.I'm starting to feel like I'm about to fall through the cracks here.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not crazy, I just need these issues treated, but my Endo is pushing me back to my primary care, who just infers that I'm crazy.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions will be MUCH appreciated.",
