            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Evening rise in temperature is generally due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis.Hence get this assessed for your father since he has fever for last 17 days. If all these are normal then other causes of prolonged fever such as SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and other auto immune disorders, UTI, drug fever, sinusitis, glandular fever, otitis media, IBS, HIV, STDs, endocarditis, parasitic infestations, fungal infections, lymphomas and other cancers etc will have to be looked into.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I dont know about all the stuff the doc posted, but it sounds to me that if it is a low grade fever, your dad is probably trying to fight off a viral infection.\u00a0\u00a0If his temperature is not over 101, I would not worry too much.\u00a0\u00a0Keep him hydrated with plenty of water, not juices that contain sugar.\u00a0\u00a0If his temperature rises or his symptoms persist, I would have him see a doctor immediately.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps and that your dad feels better soon.",
