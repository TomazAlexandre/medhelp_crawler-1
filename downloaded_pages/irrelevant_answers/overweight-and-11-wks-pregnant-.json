            "answer": "I am overweight as well. I also feel sluggish. I lost a bit of weight in the first trimester but it was due to nausea. Its not safe to \"try\" to lose weight while you're pregnant. If you focus on eating clean and healthy and moving more you will feel better and also set yourself up for success after the baby is born.",

            "answer": "This is a question I have as well as I am in the same situation at 5 weeks. I would assume that it is safe as long as the weight is being lost in a healthy manner such as proper eating and light exercise.\u00a0\u00a0If you are going to work out definitely read up on the do's and don'ts before getting started. I hope to lose a safe amount of weight but am more focused on strengthening my back, legs, and arms to hopefully make the pregnancy a little easier, not to mention hauling around the little one afterwards.",

            "answer": "In my opinion I would not try to lose weight at this point but I would try to only gain the minimum that is the safest for baby. I think you would be OK with 10 to 15 pounds. I am almost 8 months pregnant and only gained six pounds but unfortunately that is because this pregnancy I have had extreme nausea and vomiting. Also it is very common to lose wight in the beginning due to morning sickness. Well good luck!!! And I know it's easier said than done for us women but try not to worry about your figure so much. Enjoy being pregnant but don't let the pregnancy excuse lead to a crazy amount of weight gain!!! Been there done that not fun.",

            "answer": "I have lost weight during this pregnancy due to the diet i was placed on because of gestational diabetes. Honestly i wouldnt say to be on a diet but instead make different choices i used to eat a snickers almost everynight by my second trimester I weighed 230 i started substituting snickers for fruit with greek yogurt i cut out everything to drink except water and lowered carb intake also added snacking into my diet in between my 3 meals ive lost 15lbs but I wouldnt do it for weightloss i would do it to feel better im now 35 weeks have alot of energy and never feel hungry.

Now in second trimester I am gaining weight but not a lot. My doctor gave me a safe amount that she wants me to try to stick to for weight gain\u00a0\u00a0(10-15 lbs).

If you are overweight your doctor may put you on a diet in order to maintain your current weight during pregnancy and to try to prevent gestational diabetes, but it is unhealthy to try to lose weight during pregnancy. Just eat healthy foods and do some light exercise like walking for 30 minutes every day.",

I feel very sluggish and huge. I would really like to lose a little more weight so that way I'm not suffering during my last trimester. Anyone else experience an overweight problem while pregnant?
