            "answer": "Sorry to hear that your child has been so unwell.As there are autoimmune disorders and diabetes on both sides of the family, I would insist that she be checked out for that to either confirm or rule it out.Have you considered that she may have a lactose or gluten intolerance?Your daughter cannot catch normal anaemia or vertigo from you.\u00a0\u00a0But if her diet has been poor, she may have anaemia and be lacking in essential minerals and vitamins.Have you had her stools checked for any parasites or worms?\u00a0\u00a0It is surprising how they can pick up these things, even by touching contaminated door handles and then not washing before eating or touching their mouth soon afterwards.Hope you get a correct diagnosis soon.Wishing her a speedy recovery.",

    "question": "Needing suggestions:I have a 5 year old little girl. She is currently 15.4kg.She has been on antibiotics many, many times. Starting when she was 17 months old, she started having 104+ fevers and she had 3 febrile seizures.She has seen a neurologist before and he checked out her eyes and had her chase a ball down the hallway and said she was fine. when she was a little over 2 (actually a year from the first high fever), she ended up having a fever of 106.3. She has had multiple ER visits since for high fevers, facial rashes/facial swelling. The ER docs can never find a cause and always tell me its viral or they think its a bladder infection/infection of unknown origin. Usually ends up in multiple Rocephin injections. In the past 3 weeks she has had 2 ER visits (one for her entire face swelling, and for a 102.9 fever that wouldn't go away) and multiple doc appts. During the fever ER visit, the doc did a urinalysis and found trace amounts of blood and ketones (level was 40). The next day she had a doc appointment and the rapid strep came up positive. Bloodwork is now showing inflammation and we are still waiting on cultures. I try not to overstep with the doctors but I have a gut feeling there is something wrong.In the past 4 years we have had many ER Visits, Averaging a minimum of 1 high fever a month that seems to always last 3 days treated or untreated. She is very small, doesn't eat as much as she should (out of stubborness), her left eye has swelled multiple times, her face has swelled, She complains of headaches a lot (even wakes me hysterically crying), she can not be in the pool (even with 100+degree weather) without shaking and shivering within 10 minutes, she doesn't sleep a lot, she rarely has a sore throat with any of this. She does have large tonsils but an ENT doc said she doesn't meet the requirements health wise for removal.I feel that I am being brushed off a lot. I was wondering what conditions should we look into or tests we should ask for? I suffer from anemia and vitiligo and we have a history of autoimmune disorders and diabetes in both sides of the family.",
