            "answer": "Hi!Generally a stimulated and lubricated vagina accommodates any penis size. Maybe you are not stimulated and lubricated enough and both of you need to pace your self. If you have a tear and it is not healing, then either it is due to penetrating penis against a dry vagina, or underlying fungal infection or diabetes. You can avoid intercourse and fingering for a week or two and give vagina time to heal. Thereafter increase foreplay so that vagina is well lubricated before penetration. If this does not help, please consult a gynecologist.Take care!",

    "question": "I feel weird posting on here..,but lately like when I have sex it tears part of my vagina. It's like right when you put your finger in on the left 'corner'. I don't know why it keeps tearing. I'm not for sure, but I'm pretty sure it's not a disease or anything. I think it's maybe just from my boyfriends penis, but I can't find an answer on why it keeps happening. And sometimes if we change positions it doesn't hurt rite away. And then after sex my vagina feels sore?.. I don't know I just wanna know if there is anything I can do without going to my doctor.",
