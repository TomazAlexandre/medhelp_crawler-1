            "answer": "Actually, neither of those are standard of care. The most effective and up to date diabetes regimen is a long acting basal insulin such as lantus or levimir either once or twice daily and a rapid acting bolus before each meal, dose determined by an insulin:carb ratio so that the dose is covering what you are actually eating. I would ask for a referral to an endo as your doctors don't seem to be up to date on treatment.",

    "question": "In the past I was put on Novolin NPH (28 units morn and 28 at bedtime) and I was taking 7 units of reg with each meal. Well, I recently changed drs and the new dr put me on Novolog pen 70/30-I am at 18 units ever 12 hours and it is not lowering blood sugar readings at all. Does anyone have any experience with this? Is the Novolog pen comparable with the NPH and Reg regamen? I was doing well with the Novolin and I am confused as to why I was swithched. I asked my dr about it and he said that the Novolin was fast acting and the Novolg was slower and was supposed to be better control. I just dont see it. I am also feeling very tired (and my readings are ver high 311) so I know that it is not b/c of low blood sugar, and also headaches ever since I started the Novlolog70/30. I felt better before...Just really confused....",
