            "answer": "Hi Pandora,I understand your concern, and it must be frustrating that you can't talk to the doctor. I am not a doctor, just the mom of a diabetic, so I can't be diagnosing anything. But I can say that you should NOT feel guilty. Whatever you feed him in the next day or three before you can talk to the doctor won't matter that much, whether or not he has diabetes.That said, please understand the difference between \"sweets\" and carbohydrates. As far as your blood sugar is concerned, carbs are carbs, whether they come from corn or candy, bread or ice cream, pasta or potato chips. Type-1 diabetics \"count\" the amount of carbs in a meal or snack and give themselves the appropriate amount of insulin so their bodies can process those carbs. If my daughter wants a snack and doesn't want to give herself a shot, she has some protein or veggies-- a piece of chicken, or some carrots, because their carb count is so low.As for your son, don't be scared, and try to give him a break from the testing. And you shouldn't test him right after eating anyway-- it's usually done before meals and a couple of hours after.Talk to your doctor tomorrow and find out the test results. If he has diabetes, you can take him to a endocrinologist, a specialist who will help you learn how to manage the disease.\u00a0\u00a0As as the mom of a diabetic, I'm here to tell you that it is totally manageable, and my daughter is doing just great. If the doc says he doesn't have it, keep pressing for an answer, and consider taking him to an endocrinologist anyway, so you can get a definitive answer. As someone else here posted, you are your son's advocate, and clearly he has a good advocate!Let us know what happens.",

            "answer": "I am glad you took him to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0 You did not state what your son's blood sugar was prior to him eating the foods that you stated.\u00a0\u00a0Or if was after eating how long after.\u00a0\u00a0The important numbers are what his blood sugars are prior to him eating any food.\u00a0\u00a0After he eats the blood check should be 2-3 hours after eating for accurate numbers, then it should be a little higher.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor should be able to tell you what an acceptable range is for your son.i would only check his blood before eating for now unless the doctor stated other wise.\u00a0\u00a0Read the Nutritional labels on the foods that you feed him and make sure you are giving the correct portion size. STAY AWAY from the sugar free foods as most of them have more carbohydrates than regular food.\u00a0\u00a0You do not need to stay away from sugar you need to watch the carbohydrates, as they turn into glucase and raise the blood sugar.",

    "question": "I posted a few days ago.\u00a0\u00a0I took my son to the doctor yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0They did a HGBC1 or something like that.\u00a0\u00a0It was the 3 month test.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't gotten the results yet because of the snow.\u00a0\u00a0The doc's office is closed.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to keep monitoring him on a normal diet to see what the levels would be.\u00a0\u00a0Last night he had PBJ, green beans, a banana, and 2 cookies (we were having family movie night).\u00a0\u00a0They had convinced me he probably didn't have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0They only did the test because I complained so much.\u00a0\u00a0anyways, now I feel guilty for what I fed him because his level was 313.\u00a0\u00a0So today I was trying to be real good.\u00a0\u00a0I fed him baked shrimp, some corn, and he had a low sugar koolaid.\u00a0\u00a0His level was 279.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am justing getting scared.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to feed him.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously we should stay away from anything with sugar, but beyond that, I'm not sure.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone tell me the kinds of foods that contain a lot of sugar?",
