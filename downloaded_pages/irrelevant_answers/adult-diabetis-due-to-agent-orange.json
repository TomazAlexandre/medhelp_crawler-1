            "answer": "I second everything that the previous poster has written. One more thought to add... has your husband's weight increased in the past 10 years? Excess weight, a common problem as we grow older, causes insulin resistance to increase and also often causes blood pressure to rise. So if he has indeed been puttting on a few pounds each year, perhaps the two of you need to focus some energy on losing those excess pounds. Both the diabetes and the blood pressure would probably improve if this is part of the cause of the changes. We do wish him the very best.",

When I present this to the VA they say it is not service connected. My question is this: How many Agent Orange, boots on ground vet's out there have type 1 diabetes and how many more vet's would it include to have them also included with service connection? But of course we are dealing with the government who say they are for the vet but it's just lip service. Any one agree or am I the lone one out here.G the R",
