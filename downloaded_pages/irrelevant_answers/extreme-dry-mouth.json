            "answer": "Do you think maybe you wake up with a dry mouth because you are sleeping with your mouth open?\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy causes the nasal passages to swell a bit so even if you normally sleep with your mouth closed,\u00a0\u00a0the pregnancy may cause you to breath through your mouth while sleeping.\u00a0\u00a0If that is what's happening with you,\u00a0\u00a0you can try non-medicated breathe right strips. They will open up your airway and possibly fix the problem.",
