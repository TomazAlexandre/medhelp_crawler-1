            "answer": "Hi Kittyface,Good to hear from you. I have been on Alinia mono for 3 months nowand my VL went from 99K to 46K. Still possible but not likely to clearon Alinia alone like that mini trial for geno 4s in Egypt.The last onewent UND after 20wks Alinia so maybe 8 more wks ?Anyway I am looking into the R7128 trial which looks pretty good.Problem now is do let me in since I am taking Alinia.Also ironically my VL is to low with 46k. 50K is cut of for trial.And I thought decisions were going to be easier\u00a0\u00a0going with tx instead of alternative.Keep my fingers crossed for your health problems.",

            "answer": "I too had a lot of inflamation after tx. I was able to get it resolved by stopping all fats and animal protein in my diet. Less than 10% of my diet is fat now and I feel great. My recurring pericarditis and burning eyes went away. Not to mention my body looks better than it ever did. I work out with weights and jog on a treadmill and with the extremely low fat diet my inflamation has subsided.There is a good book \"reversing heart deseae\" that I read.Bobby",

    "question": "Hi, how is everybody?Want to give you a heads up as I deal with other health issues caused by 28 years of undiagnosed HCV.\u00a0\u00a0I cleared, am about one year post tx and feeling great. . .except for a little diabetes and arteriosclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0A CIMT revealed that I have thickening of the arteries commonly seen in a 95 year old woman even though I'm 56 and very health conscious (diet, exercise, supplements, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0Also developed diabetes type 1 (very odd at my age) of which there is no family history (and I'm not overweight).\u00a0\u00a0So now I'm off to the cardiologist to see if I can head off a heart attack/stroke.I've researched these conditions and it appears that they are caused by INFLAMMATION --\u00a0\u00a0the kind that occurs as your body tries to fight the virus.\u00a0\u00a0Nice, huh?\u00a0\u00a0 A new reason to tx sooner rather than later even with minimal liver damage.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to add some Alinia to the mix.\u00a0\u00a0It helped me clear.Best,Kittyface",
