    "question": "In September 2014 at the age of 43 I was married to my boyfriend, age 53. We had dated for past 5 years. Niether of us have biological children with former mates.....2 years ago we discussed having baby. We decided to quit using birth control, and accepted the notion that if I became pregnant naturally, we would be blessed and if I did not become pregnant, we would have more money for early retirement and travel.October 2014 my period was \"late\".I was indeed pregnant with a honeymoon baby!We told no one in our family until after receiving results of genetic testing at 20 weeks....Christmas was a fine time to share we were pregnant with a healthy boy....to date.Anemia and Gestational Diabetes were my only complications....no morning sickness!Baby was also in a Frank Breech position so I had to have a C Section.Monday June 1 at 7:31 AM I delivered the mist amazing, healthy baby!My Dr. had asked me to stay off the Internet whole pregnant, which I did, and so I did not read all the scary stuff for women if advanced maternal age.I wanted to share my story and hope that it can bring someone else some hope and comfort on thier journey to pregnancy and child birth.Best of Luck",
