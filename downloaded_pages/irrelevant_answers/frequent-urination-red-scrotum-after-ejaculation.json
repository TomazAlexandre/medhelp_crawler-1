    "question": "I am a 38 yr old male, who according to the numerous doctors I have seen is in perfect health. At the age of 19, shortly after having oral sex with my girlfriend, I had a uniform red painful scrotum after ejaculation what would dry and peel off about 5 days later. Everything would be normal until the next time I ejaculated. Tests for STDs, fungus were negative. Also had small painful mouth sores. Three years later, the red scrotum problem ended but was replaced by intense full bladder urination that occured every half hour, less often if I stopped drinking anything. Prostate exam revealed a normal sized prostate. Exams for all STDs were negative. This went on for about two years. Then the frequent urination was chronic (daily) but less severe in intensity. Ultrasounds revealed normal kidneys, bladder. Prostate still normal size. Tests for diabetes, diabetes insipidus, Potassium problems were negative. Urine and semen cultures revealed no bacteria; however, blood tests before getting married showed antibodies for chlamydia and herpes 2. I had a cold sore on my bottom lip once. Doctor informed me the cold sore was most likely the Herpes 2 and I shouldn't worry about genital herpes-just not to have oral sex or kissing if there was an outbreak. Chlamydia treated with some short course of antibiotics. Active antibodies in blood decreased. Doctors said symptoms however were not chlamydia.Today frequent urination continues. More severe with masturbation than intercourse. Occasional upset stomach, extreme but controllable burping, chills, and irritated (but not red or dry) penis and scrotum seem related. Oral sores occur infrequently. Doctors are clueless and offer no help.\u00a0\u00a0Am tired of this after 18 yrs and stressed over passing anything to my wife and son (son because wife keeps sharing her fork and spoon when feeding him). She also gets mouth sores, cold sores in nose-which she had for years before meeting me.Can this be prostatitis, epidydimitis, chlamydia (oral and/or genital), or some other infection I don't know about? Please advise.",
