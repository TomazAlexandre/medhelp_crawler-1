    "question": "I have been peeing like once or twice every hour. I have been having a lot of sex in the past couple of days but before that I only did on february 14...well acctually the 15th and I got my period february 3rd or 4th...I just got this months period on the 4th but I was pregnant once before and I did misscarry but I still got a what seemed normal to me period. I'm just wondering what anybody thinks...should I take a pregnancy test...or is it not pregnancy related? I looked it up an I saw stuff about diabetes and UTI thats what im more worried about but its completely painful the thing is I haven't really been drinkin a lot either I had a soda and a 2 cups of iced tea all day an I was in the bathroom probably like 10 times. If anybody has any suggestions or anything please let me know. I may go to get pregnancy test tomorrow but i really don't think i am. then again it seems when I think im not is when I really am an when I think I might be is when Im not.",
