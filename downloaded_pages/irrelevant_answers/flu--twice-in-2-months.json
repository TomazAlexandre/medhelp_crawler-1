            "answer": "Vitamin D is now the most requested lab test over all other lab test. And for good reason (see list below!).\u00a0\u00a0I had this test done when i heard of the increased risk of cancer and found i had severe vitamin D deficiency. This explained why i had bronchitis (3 weeks), strep throat twice (1 month and over 2 weeks) and a cold (1 week) in less than 6 months. I had bone pain in my hand which i thought was arthritis but was due to vitamin D deficiency. Vitamin D council recommend 50 - 80ng/mL (125 - 200nmol/L) year round.Excerpts from the article \"How Vitamin D Protects You from the Flu and Other Infections\"...\"A new study has confirmed that vitamin D plays an important role in activating your immune defenses against infectious diseases like the flu.Vitamin D deficiency has already been linked to a wide spectrum of diseases including heart disease, cancer, diabetes, depression, autoimmune disease and many others.The new study discovers that activation of T-cells to fight infections needs definite help from vitamin D. When a T cell recognizes foreign invaders like bacteria or viruses, it sends activating signals to the vitamin D receptor gene. The VDR gene then starts producing DVR protein, which binds vitamin D in the T cell. Then the vitamin D bound and activated DVR produces PLC-gamma1 protein \u2014 which allows the T cell to get started fighting the infection.Dr. John Cannell has also reported that vitamin D helps produce antibacterial peptides that help protect against the flu. That is why in winter, when there is little sunshine, people are more prone to vitamin D deficiency and getting infected with flu viruses.\"\"Just take a look at this list of common chronic diseases that researchers have linked to vitamin D deficiency:CancerHypertensionHeart diseaseAutismObesityRheumatoid arthritisDiabetes 1 and 2Multiple SclerosisCrohn\u2019s diseaseCold & FluInflammatory Bowel DiseaseTuberculosisSepticemiaSigns of agingDementiaEczema & PsoriasisInsomniaHearing lossMuscle painCavitiesPeriodontal diseaseOsteoporosisMacular degenerationReduced C-section riskPre-eclampsiaSeizuresInfertilityAsthmaCystic fibrosisMigrainesDepressionAlzheimer\u2019s diseaseSchizophreniaAnd as if that wasn\u2019t enough, a 2008 meta-analysis of 18 randomized controlled trials concluded that supplemental vitamin D significantly reduces mortality from ALL causes!\"",

    "question": "Hi everyone,My girlfriend and I had a flu two months ago, when we moved to a new (and pretty cold and windy) city. We recovered normally with some paracetamol. Hers was much more mild, I had a cough for a few weeks.Now, two months later, we went to an amusement park, getting totally exhausted and caught a lot of rain as well. I insisted in an open window at night, and then\u00a0\u00a0now she has flu symptoms again.Is it normal to have a cold/flu twice in this two-month period? We are a 30y.o. couple, 3 years living together, with no prior conditions or diseases. I write because I am a bit hypochondriac and I would feel better with some feedback.Thanks in advance!",
