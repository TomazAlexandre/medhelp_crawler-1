    "question": "I often have palpitations and strange slightly faint/dizzy/agitated after eating carbs. My dr mentioned Dumping Syndrome, which is where the stomach contents empty into the small intestine too quickly causing a rapid release of insulin into the bloodstream. He also said it was usually common in top athletes(not me then), has this anything to do with diabetes and what can I do about this??",
