            "answer": "Hi!It's a tricky situation you're going through and I can only imagine how stressing it can be. Some questions concerning your UTI's...All these 20 UTI's you had since 2007, were they all full force UTI's? By that, I mean; each time you were seeing possible symptoms, were you having a urine analysis and a culture to actually make sure it was a UTI or a cystitis, so that the bacteria causing it could be identified and the proper antibiotics could be prescribed?Did you treat all of them with antibiotics and if yes, was it the same antibiotic each time? Perhaps, you have a persistent/resistant type of bacteria and need to treat it for a long time with a combination of antibiotics, or with stronger antibiotics that you've already had.Aside from the scope, did you ever have any other tests, like an ultrasound (kidneys, ureters etc.) to check if there are any anatomical defects or kidney stones that could be causing the frequent UTI's?You mentioned you suffer from candida albicans. That's a yeast infection. Are you treating it? If not treated, it could be a potential cause of your many UTI's. Just visit your gynecologist and start treating it if you haven't so far. Did you get the yeast infection when started having an active sexual life or before? Also, the constant use of antibiotics for your UTI's could be one cause of your candida albicans infection.Try to practise safe sex and maintain good hygiene of your urogynecological area. If not treating your candidiasis, go to your doctor and start treating it.Diabetes is also a possible cause for your too many UTI's. If you have a hereditary predisposition for diabetes or are overweight etc., it would be nice to check your glucose levels.I wish you very good luck with it. Stay calm and don't despair. Hope you feel better soon! :)))",

            "answer": "Hi,What were the results of your examinations? was an abdominal CT scan done?Have you been compliant with your medications?For patients with recurrent UTI, it is best to rule out any structural abnormalities like an obstructive stone, a polyp or for younger patients a structural anomaly. The presence of a yeast infection may also cause a burning pain with urination. I suggest you seek consult with your gynecologist to address this yeast infection and also to assess other structures.However, the priority now\u00a0\u00a0is to identify what causes your symptoms ,Differentials would be bacterial or fungal infections, urethral syndrome, kydney stones and interstitial cystitis.Stay positive and kep an open line of communication with your physicians.",

    "question": "hi, i have been suffering from bladder infections since last april 2007. that was also when i became sexually active. i have had no less than 20 infections in less than 1 year. i did see a urologist who suggested a scope. i had the scope done. i was put on anti-biotics for 2-3 months but the infections still take place approximately every 2/3 weeks. the urologist also said i have a high-pressure bladder and put me on enablex. unfortunately i still get infections. my urine gets a musty, strong smell and a cloudy color to it -thats when i know an infection is coming. the urologist says i might have a burning bladder. what is that? and how is it different to an infection? he does not believe that i have infections -but then what is it? and why does my urine burn like it does? i also suffer from candida albicans. could this be related? i know frequent infections is a sign of diabetes? should i do a diabetic test? i am depressed and will try anything but nothing seems to work. please help!!!!!!!",
