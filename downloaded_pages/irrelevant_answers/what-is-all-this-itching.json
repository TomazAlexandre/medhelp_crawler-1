            "answer": "could be lupus, but I highly doubt it. IT IS NOT LYME Disease. Might be Amyloidosis, or Diabetes. Itching is caused from an allergic reaction to something. It is my strong opinion that your lymphatic system is fighting an infection or it might be lymphoma. Might want to see an Oncologist and get more tests run to be sure. The circulation and lymphatic system overload is telling me that time is running out. Especially since your liver and kidneys are running low. The tingling and numbness is signal interruption of the nervous system (could be due to the lack of circulation) means it might be a problem in the brain or spinal cord (could be a leak of spinal fluid going through your system causing the massive shutdown). either way. Get to a Dr.. Have them to a CT/MRI of your spine to confirm a leak in CSF (Cerebro-Spinal Fluid)",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dry skin is the commonest cause of generalized itching. Applying a moisturizer and using only soaps that are gentle on the skin is helpful in this case. Hypothyroidism too causes dry skin. Please get your thyroid function checked. It could also be due to overuse of AC and heaters.\u00a0\u00a0If you have blisters at tip of fingers and dry skin then you need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition.Some liver problems and gall stones too can cause generalized itch.Generalized itching can be due to allergy. Common allergens are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, synthetic fiber, food, cosmetics (powders, soaps, shampoos\u2014see if anything was recently changed) or drugs. Food allergies like to gluten, lactose, sea food, and alcohol etc too should be looked into.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be due to new soap, talcum powder, clothes etc. You must get an allergy test done, either a skin test or RAST, to know what you are allergic to. Fungal infections like tinea corporis and tinea cruris too cause whole body itching along with genital itching.If the itch is only in the exposed part, it can also be due to sun allergy. Pubic and body lice can be another cause. Worms are another cause of both anal and body itch and hence get a stool test.Low estrogens are supposed to be the cause too. PCOD and hormone imbalance too can be a cause.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "Well for one, the tanning bed is\u00a0\u00a0no longer in use.\u00a0\u00a0It was only used that once, and thats all it took, they checked for lupus, and lyme disease and waiting on test results. But doc is sending me to urologist as soon as I get the results because my kidneys and liver is low, itching everywhere now all over body with no rash.Veins are burning. Dont worry about me tanning, It took 1 time and I have been dealing with this since August 2010. So why would i get back in there,lol.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I have to wait on these results and stay strong. Its been about a week now and still have not got them back, uggghh!! I need to pray to be more patient i guess. A lot of the family members think I have dna damage and tissue damage, I just started seeing this new doctor and she acts like she is really concerned which is real good. I also have been suffering from low grade fever , numbness and tingling of my limbs, bad circulation to where i turn blue everywhere. Also I have this iching, no rash. dont know what it is but hopefully if you have been through this please let me know. I do have red blotches which doc looked over that is under the skin, which he said, it can be from liver disease, heart and kidney disease. no rash over skin when i am itching, but do bruise easily",
