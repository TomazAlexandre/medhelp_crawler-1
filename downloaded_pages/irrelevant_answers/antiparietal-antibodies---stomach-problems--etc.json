    "question": "For past year, have experienced stomach pain, mostly upper right, some lower left. Also severe right rib pain. Gallbladder removed 2004. Colonoscopy in January-all normal except for a hemorrhoid. Upper endoscopy in April, showing chronic&acute mild inflammation of the duodenom. In early 2005,had an upper GI/small bowel follow through(barium study) which demonstrated mild reflux, nothing else. Since May 06, have experienced neuro issues (peripheral neuropathy, no muscle weakness, just mild loss of sensation in face, hands, feet). Minor issues with swallowing & speech. Mild painful tongue. Tinnitus. Fatigue. Insomnia. Depression. Was tested for MS, Myasthenia Gravis, Lupus, Porphyria, metal toxicity, thyroid, parathyroid, diabetes - normal. EMG/NC studies normal. Brain MRI showed a few lesions, not MS, likely related to migraines as no change from MRI 5 years ago. Spinal tap negative. Had a positive tilt table test-postural hypotension. Cervical/thoraci MRI-normal. Blood tests showed elevated antiparietal antibodies (37.5 - positive). C3 complement mildly elevated at 185. Cortisol elevated (24 hr - 88), but ACTH normal (on low end). No pituitary/adrenal tumors. Transferrin elevated at 388. Ferritin on low end of normal-13. Saturation slightly below normal 14. But, serum iron normal-53. B12/Folate normal. CBC's in normal range. Doc said iron supps for 6 weeks, then to retest iron, B12, folate, antiparietal antibodies. Does this sound right to you? Also, Re: antiparietal AB's 1) could they cause these symptoms? 2) Is there any way to treat for the AB's? 3) what causes the AB's?",
