    "question": "So I got a call this morning saying my one hour glucose levels were elevated and I have to do a three hour test... This is my fourth and I have never had to do the three hour test before. I am really disappointed because for the last 2.5 years I have been eating whole foods, limiting sugar, and exercising a lot. This really came out of nowhere. I am hoping to pass the 3 hour test. My husband is mad at me for some reason about the whole issue, although I fail to see how or why he would be more upset than I already am.",
