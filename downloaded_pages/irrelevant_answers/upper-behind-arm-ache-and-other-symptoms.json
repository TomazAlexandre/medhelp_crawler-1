    "question": "So I have begun to worry about some symptoms I am having. I am a 24 year old male that smokes. I went to the hospital back in July because one of my pupils was way bigger than the other one, and the doctor diagnosed it as anisicornia. Yesterday I start having aches behind both of my arms that come and go. Not sharp pains or anything, just aches. When I exercise or run or anything like that the pain goes away, I seem to only feel it when I am sitting nothing doing anything. I also (more specifically at night when laying down) I get sharp sudden pains throughout my body but more common in the upper, it last for just a second then goes away and I might not feel it again the rest of the night. I have had symptoms like this and similar to this for about the last 2 years to a year and a half. I do have a job where I am at a desk leaning over a computer all day so I guess it could be something with my nerves? I do have a history of anxiety and I feel most doctors just chalk it up as that and don't give me a closer look. I have noticed that when I am not thinking about anything or doing an activity I usually never have these symptoms, but sometimes I still do, but rarely. Doing a Google search (I know not a good thing to do) My symptoms match those of diabetes or gallbladder problems, more specifically gallbladder.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not an extremely healthy eater, but I don't eat junk either and am not overweight, and my sugar consumption I would say it way below average. Also none of these pains keep me from doing anything, I can still run, jump, etc... and never have chest pain or anything when I am doing those activities. I just can't help but think the worst.",
