            "answer": "Have all but eliminated aspartame from diet. Seems like it's everywhere. She's had 6 known seizures in last 9 days. We're schedule to go to Shands in Gainesville Fl a week from Friday. Local Drs don't want to alter anything til we go. Makes it rough to deal with. Her spirit is mostly broken. She feels like no one realizes how hard these things are on her body. It takes on average, 3 days to recover, and some longer. Come on 08.08.08.",

            "answer": "For the last 3 years, our lives have been through a bitter struggle. Watching our 13 year old daughter having grandmal seizures is very taxing.\u00a0\u00a0They (grandmals) take a huge toll.\u00a0\u00a0I'm convinced that there is another way\u00a0\u00a0to overcome this.\u00a0\u00a0By the\u00a0\u00a0grace of God. Our daughter now 16,had about 4-5 grandmals in one day.\u00a0\u00a0We were vegetarians and modified that to a vegan diet, no meat, dairy, cheese and no processed foods.\u00a0\u00a0and tried some anti-spasmodic herbs.\u00a0\u00a0She has about 6 grand mals a year (and that's when she makes wrong choices) We have never given her any medication for this disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the Doctors are not at all convinced that lifestyle can help. It's all about medicine.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm still researching how to improve this disorder.\u00a0\u00a0And with her, she already has a brain malformation.\u00a0\u00a0I can just imagine how magnificently diet reform, exercise, prayer, LOTS of water, sunshine, the right use of herbs...would work for someone with a normal MRI but has seizures.Just a thought.....Take care nowGones",

            "answer": "It is tough to kick the diet soda addiction, but there are other options.\u00a0\u00a0Adding Stevia (a 0 carb sugar substitute) to Kool-Aid instead of sugar works, and I seem to be able to drink things sweetened with Splenda just fine.\u00a0\u00a0Diet Rite and some other pops use Splenda, though this is still a trigger for some people.\u00a0\u00a0I think I'm lucky in that respect.As for the gum, that'd probably be something you'd just\u00a0\u00a0have\u00a0\u00a0to kick :)\u00a0\u00a0And regular yogurt shouldn't bee too much of a sugar rush for diabetics, though I am not one so I could be wrong there.It was literally night and day for me, so why not give it a week and see if you see a difference.\u00a0\u00a0If not you can go back to your\u00a0\u00a0old ways :)\u00a0\u00a0Just last weekend I was at the lake and only had Diet Coke to drink, so I had 4 cans in 3 days and had a big old migraine the next day!Nicole",

Potassium and B12 being to of the easiest to lose. Water and fruit juices, etc. Going back fro 3-5 day Telemetry and complete daily diary for wake up, meds, food, naps, etc.",

    "question": "My girlfriend, 32, is on Topamax and Keppra, as well as hydrocodone for migrains. She has had an increasing number of seizures in the last year. We recently did 4 days in hospital for Telemetry bed to no avail. Pharmacy in hospital did an analysis and recommended Dr. look at other seizure meds like Depakote etc. The Neurologist looked at the recommendation for about 30 seconds and said nothing. Now we are waiting on referral to Shands in Gainesville, Fl. for more telemetry. She has only been able to work about two weeks total since January and took FMLA in February. Stress is a major contributor as her short term memory is shot and cognitive test wasn't very good either. Just looking for advice or maybe do's and don'ts in the medical community.",
