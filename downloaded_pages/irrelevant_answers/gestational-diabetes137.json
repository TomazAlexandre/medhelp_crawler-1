If it hurts your fingers too bad you can also prick the top of your forearm. The tissue is thicker so it won't hurt you as badly. First time stickers usually have some issues lol. It does get better though I promise.",

Women who had gestational diabetes are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life, in which case you'll have no choice but to follow your diet. Even gestational diabetes is a very serious health issue and needs to be cared for properly",

Add insulin to the mix and that's when you get the 10+ lb babies and become even more at risk for having a c section.",

            "answer": "Large babies are caused by moms blood sugars being too high, not the insulin. If moms blood sugar is too high babies blood sugar will be high, this causes the baby's pancreas to work harder to produce more insulin which can produce a larger baby. The insulin that mom either produces or injects doesn't cross into the baby, just the excess sugar",

            "answer": "I have type 2 diabetes so I've had this my whole pregnancy. It isn't so bad once they get your meds right. But you can say goodbye to sugar, a lot of carbs, fruit, ice cream, juice and anything else too sweet in general. You still need to eat some carbs and you can have sweets sparingly. The thing is just to watch your sugars. You want to try and keep your numbers below 120- 2 hours after meals and preferably between 65-95 first thing in the morning. No one is perfect and there will be days where you are going to cheat or go over in your numbers. The thing is to not let it become a habit. If you go over once in awhile it's no big deal, you just don't want to do that on a daily basis. I have to see a perinatologist (which you may have to start seeing) they deal with diabetes and high risk pregnancy and I also have to see a fetal cardiologist. I also get ultrasounds once a week with the perinatologist and have weekly NST test with the obgyn. The fetal cardiologist you may have to see, they check baby's heart just to make sure it doesn't get to thick (which will cause baby to grow faster than normal) with GD there will be a bit of thickening which is normal, cause if not they would say you were diagnosed wrong. Best thing is try not to stress and eat healthy. It is easier than you think, I've been dealing with this since day 1 of my pregnancy and I'm 33 almost 34 weeks and they said my baby looks fantastic! She's going to be on the bigger side a little over 8 lbs but everything looks great! And baby is not the one who produces too much insulin, it's you that will produce to much insulin and it passes through the placenta. After birth baby will lose the extra insulin about a month or two afterwards. I just came from my fetal cardiologist today and she said everything still looks great. So try and stick to that diet as much as possible but we are all human and going to slip, just don't make it a habit. You will do just fine!",
