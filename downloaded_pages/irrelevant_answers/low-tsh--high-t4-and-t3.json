            "answer": "I don't know the reference ranges for your frees. Are those high? I can see that your TSH is on the low end. Your antibodies are high. Those labs plus your symptoms point to Graves, IMHO.Where's the thyroid ultrasound?I live in a big city which has a high diabetes rate. I have personally spoken with six endocrinologists here. I have found one out of the six who actually knows how to properly treat and diagnose thyroid disease. All the rest seem to focus on diabetes. This happens to many of us thyroid patients.You should get a second opinion. Call the endo's office and ask the ratio of thyroid to diabetes patients in that office. 75 percent of my endo's patients have thyroid disease.Below is a site with recommended endos.http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/:) Tamra",

            "answer": "Thank you Tamra for your response! The ranges for the FT4 is 10.2 - 19.5 and the FT3 is 2.5 - 5.3, so they are both at the higher end of the range. I just know something is wrong with me. I've always been an upbeat, happy, energetic person and now I can't enjoy life at all. I got off all medications back in June because the doctors kept trying to blame the symptoms on those but I knew that wasn't the cause. I was taking birth control pills and effexor XR. I had been on Effexor for 4 years for panic attacks and then in April I started having breakthrough attacks and even started having anxiety attacks and adrenaline rushes that I hadn't experienced before. They seemed to go away after I got off the medicine, until the end of October, the anxiety came back.I've never had the thyroid ultrasound done. My endo has only done the blood work and then sees me 3 months after. He doesn't try to investigate in the meantime of why I'm having these symptoms. I'm going to look for a new endo because I know it has to be either my adrenal glands or thyroid. My mother was diagnosed with Hyperthyroidism two years ago, my dad had hypo, my sister has hypo, my mom's mom has hypo, my dad's dad had hypo, and my dad's sister has hypo. So it runs very thick in my family.It is so frustrating! I'm scared I'm going to lose my job because I've missed so many days this year and I can't get FMLA because I don't have a diagnosis. My relationship with my boyfriend is suffering too because I'm just not the person he fell in love with. I will use that site you suggested to look for a new endo. Thank you so much for you help!Heather",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 24 yr old female, 5'0\", 95 lbs. I have been dealing with horrible symptoms for a year now, been to lots of specialists, and no one seems to find anything wrong through testing. I've lost 18 lbs since March without trying. I can't seem to keep weight on. I haven't had a menstrual cycle for 2 months, my hair is falling out, and my eyebrow hair just started falling out last week. I just started getting adrenaline rushes about 1-2 hrs after eating, that comes with disorientation ( can't think straight, feel like I am having an out of body experience, no grasp on reality, confusion, anxiety, rapid pounding heart, excessive sweating, irritability, extreme hunger,\u00a0\u00a0severe headache, dizziness, feeling like I may pass out, trembling and shaking, feel like my insides are trembling, tingling in face, tinnitis. My blood pressure usually raises during these episodes to 120/80 when it is normally 90/60. I am often very overly emotional, can't handle stressful situations, my armpit sweat sometimes smells like male cat urine, I've become clumsy, can't spell simple words, memory loss, trouble making sense with speech, blurry vision.My TSH is: 0.66Free T4: 19.25 pmol/lFree T3: 5.17 pmol/lT3: 1.84 nmol/lT4: 9.00 ug/dlTPO: 102 IU/mLMy endocrinologist is running an ACTH test on Friday to check my adrenal glands. An ER doctor suggested maybe I have Pheochromocytoma. My mother has Hyperthyroidism, my father had Hypothyroidism, my sister Hypo, my grandma (mom's side): Hypo, my grandpa (dad's side): Hypo. I can barely function through the day and no one is taking me seriously. Please at least give me a direction to go, I really believe I have grave's disease but my endocrinologist doesn't seem to believe that's the problem. Thank you for listening.",
