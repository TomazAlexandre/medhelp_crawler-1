            "answer": "Most statistics at this point predict that type 1 diabetes shortens the lifespan by about 15 years. Of course, this is stated from data averaging the lifespans of type 1 diabetics up to this point. I, like you, am a long-time type 1 diabetic (37 years), and, in my affiliation wth the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, I am in contact wtih many other type 1 diabetics and parents of type 1 diabetics across the country. I have noticed a growing number of type 1 diabetics opting for very tight control of their glucsoe levels (many patients are now using either the combination of Lantus and a quick-acting insulin such as Humalog or Novalog OR pumps, both of which seem to be helpful in acheiving very normal hemoglobin a1c numbers. I frequently hear now of type 1 diabetic patiens wtih a1c numbers in the mid- to upper-5's and low 6's, something unheard of even 10 years ago with treatments that were available then.Furthermore, many endocrinologists have lowered what they consider to be \"normal\" glucose ranges and are encouraging patients to attempt to keep pre-meal glucose levels under 100, which was again not really possible a few years ago.So my prediction is that this statistic will cease to be accurate in coming years, for the cause of complications is higher-than-normal glucose levels. If new treatments are able to keep patients' glucose levels within normal levels without risk of severe hypoglycemia, I believe we will see diabetics living longer lives. Unfortunately, it takes a generation to prove this, so stay tuned.Alas, I have\u00a0\u00a0no percentages for you, for in order to have percentages of type 1 diabetics using certain treatments or living 40 years or longer, there would have to exist some central database of type 1 diabetics. No such tracking exists now. The best answer I can offer is the lifespan 15 years shorter than normal vaue that current records show. This statistic is of course taken of folks who have already lived their lifespans (folks like you and I cannot be tabulated yet since no one knows how long we will live), and does NOT reflect at all people whose lifespans have included treatments with pumps and newer insulins made available in recent years. Those records will show up a generation from now.We do hear from many long-timers such as you and I... there are many of us out there, but again I cannot offer percentages without having all endocrinologists logging their patients into one central database.As for the most common treatment, diabetics contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Online Diabetes Support Team daily, and we see many using Lantus and many using pumps these days. However, we also hear from folks still content wtih NPH or Regular or other insulins that were the standard\u00a0\u00a0a few years ago, for each person's schedule and needs are different. Most doctors nowadays attempt to find the best match of insulin regimen for each individual's life and habits. Variation is good, for we can find the system of care which works the best for each of us wtihout attempting to fit all people into one or two molds.",

            "answer": "Hey SGG - I have a quick question for you. Since we will probably find a cure in about 10-15 years, will a teenager such as myself, being 16, have long term effects of diabetes down the road still? For example will my period of twenty years of diabetes carry long term effects, even though I'm cured?'One more thing...I've read about some diabetics being impotent. If I am cured before encountering that dilemma, will I be okay with that issue? Or is there still a risk of me becoming impotent still? I keep fairly good control of my diabetes.",

            "answer": "Pat, these are good questions. The answer is that your condition after a cure is going to depend on your condition BEFORE the cure. If you can keep tight control over the glucose numbers now, you minimize the chances of damages (studies have proven this over and over again). This does not take a scientist's knowledge to understand, for ALL of the complications are rooted in the same thing: high levels of glucose damage tiny blood vessels carrying blood to nerves and organs, and therefore these nerves or organs themselves can be damaged for lack of proper nourishment. This is the\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes 101 explanation, for of course there are more complex medical things that happen that can cause damages, but the fact remains that none of the damages will happen if glucose levels are normal. So we protect ourselves by working to keep the glucose levels from rising above the normal levels after meals as much as possible. And when they DO rise because we goofed on a carb count or activity level, we try to lower them as soon as possible before they damage us.If a person has suffered severe complications and then is cured of diabetes, those complications do not magically go away, for the damage is already done to the organs or nerves. It IS true, however, that people who suffer complications do seem to improve some by tightening up glucose control, so the body is able to repair itself somewhat if damage is stopped early. Each case is unique, of course.Now, not all diabetics suffer complications. I, for example, have been on insulin for 37 years and have no damages, even though I was diagnosed long before good control was even possible, for in my early years of diabetes, we did not even have glucometers! Some people seem to genetically be blessed with some sort of resistance to damages, while others seem to be more prone to the damages. We cannot control our genes, but we CAN control the numbers we live with daily and we CAN test often enough to know when gluocse levels are rising and take insulin to lower them back to the normal ranges. I frankly beleive that frequent testing is the real root of good control.So as far as impotence is concerned, this is caused by nerve damage, and keeping good glucose control will protect you from this complication.A case in point here... a year or so ago, I unfortunately caught the flu, having not been able to get a flu shot until I actually caught the flu. I was ill for about a month, and glucose levels were elevated above my usual very tight control. A month or so later, I had my semi-annual eye dilation and exam. The eye doctor saw a couple of tiny specks of blood in the back of the eye, the first signs of possible hemorrages. Of course, I wondered if my lifelong wonderful health was about to end. At this point, my flu was gone and I was back to my usual excellent control. My eye doctor re-scheduled a visit for three months later to see what would happen. Would the hemorrages be bigger or would they go away? Well, three months later, they were completely gone, absorbed by my body the way a bruise is absorbed as the blood is carried away from the damaged area. The point of the story is that tight control HELPS your body heal itself, and even though my control was not awful while sick, just that slight elevation of glucose levels was enough to cause blood vessel damage during the time I was ill.The hard work does pay off, and I am living proof of this fact. 37 years after the original diagnosis, my health is as good or better than any other woman my age. Diabetes in and of itself does not cause damage -- high glucose levels are the cause of the damage, and this we can prevent by testing often and taking appropriate insulin. Diabetes does not automatically doom you to have higher-than-normal glucose numbers if you test often and respond to the numbers you see on the meter.",

            "answer": "Dear ursamere and Pat,Thank you so much for contacting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.We are all volunteers here and are not physicians, but we can give our life experiences dealing with type 1 diabetes.I completely agree with SSG's information. There is not much that I can add, but to try to encourage everyone to maintain as tight control of your blood sugars as possible. JDRF's main focus is to fund research for a cure and to help with the complications that can happen.ursamere and Pat, my aunt developed type 1 at a very young age around 1935. It is amazing with the lack of knowledge and treatment back then that she lived this long, but she lived to be 100 years old. I know that this is not the norm, but we do not fully understand how gentetics can play into complications and longevity. I agree with SGG that as tighter control is maintained by those with type 1, the lifespan will expand. There is no hard evidence of this yet, but the research seems to confirm this.As far as a complication with impotence, this is a very viable question. It is a possibility, but there are medications that can help if it occurs. Pat, I am not talking down to you in any way. You are asking intelligent questions and commenting with very responsible answers. Not to mention, very brave in asking a question that is not normally discussed and should be. I am hoping this is a general question in anticipation of your future life. If it is not, I would highly recommend that you speak to your doctor or if you can, a parent. I would like to see you continue with comments here.Please continue to respond and let us know how you are both doing.dm",

They are really easy to treat though and i have never had one below 3. I wanted to know if these hypos have an effect on my long term health just as the high blood sugars do or if they only put me in the immediate danger of hypoglacemia, of which i am managing to avoid quite quickly. At the moment i am happy with my blood sugars and don't really mind hypos because i can easily spot the sign and always carry something with me to treat it but if it is doing me long term damage i will have to think more about adjusting my insulin.",

My mom had to squeezed diapers to be able to test my urine and results were not that accurate. They told her that they couldn't guaranteed that I would make it to 5yrs old but if I did the average was 20 yrs old. Growing up my sugar was almost always high but I was healthy and rarely got sick. Something that really puzzled my doctor. 45 yrs later I'm here, alive and with very little complications. Why??????????? I don't know, I guess God has a plan for me and I'm very thankful. I've known other diabetics that have had a lot of problems in a very short time. Could it be the genes???? Now, I have to tell you that I have been taking natural products like nutrients and probiotics for the past 10 yrs. A lot of doctors don't want to believe in these products but I do. They help me and make me feel much better. I hope this help everybody.",

The insulin was called Zinc Suspension and if it got cold it would Crystallize in the bottle and block the needle which was a bast--d. What made it worse I had only one needle which I had to sharpen myself on a oil stone. The needle were not like todays one (lovely and fine), you had to stick a wire through it to keep it clean.Testing was done over a myths burner using urine, and did it stink. Blue meant\u00a0\u00a0you going to have a hypo and orange was you had to much sugar so there wasn't dinner for me that night.That was controlled by cutting back on your food intake, later by insulin.I have had a active life, done just about everything,to many to mention.
