            "answer": "You can increase your walking to one hour. Also walk like you mean it, do not stroll. Most important is to control and manage your diabetes. Then limit your carbohydrate food intake for weight loss. Use Google to search and understand the difference between 'simple carbs and complex carbs'. Go to the Atkins web site for low carb information and recipes. Click on programs to get started. http://atkins.com/Homepage.aspxPay careful attention to your breath, your body odor, or urine if any starts to have a fruity sweet smell. This is the beginning of ketosis caused by the body switching from burning carbohydrates to only fat. It is telling you that your carb intake is way too low. Ketosis can be hard on your kidneys so don't eliminate carbs altogether. Good luck",
