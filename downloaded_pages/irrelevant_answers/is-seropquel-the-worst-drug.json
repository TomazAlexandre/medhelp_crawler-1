            "answer": "From what I understand, when you drop seroquel you go into mixed state of mania. That doesn't mean it is a bad drug, it means it was working to keep you out of mania. When you stop taking it - mania; when you take it - no mania. That's an effective drug. You are not addicted to it. If you were addicted you would crave an increase of the drug. It is just doing the job it is intended to do.",

            "answer": "There is a big difference between addiction and discontinuation syndrome. Like Anne said if you were addicted you would crave it, you would be asking the doctor for more and more, and you would get a 'high' from it.Discontinuation syndrom makes a drug hard to come off off because there are side effects. Effexor is the worst from the reports I hear, but they all can be pretty horrible. It is really important you taper down very slowly, that will help mitigate the side effects. You can actually cause seizures going off meds cold turkey. It is a rare side effect, but a completely preventable one.It actually sounds like it is working for you. If the symptoms come back when you stop it, wouldn't the more logical assumption be that it is helping keep those symptoms away. The goal should not be to dispense of medication but to stay on what works. I know the thought of taking meds for the rest of your life is harsh, but if it keeps you from being mixed - isn't it worth it?",

            "answer": "thank you both. You touched the exact point. seroquel is working for me well except that the idea to be on it for long is tormenting me. I feel my life depends on it. each day i wake up and i have to remember it.few years ago i was on 50 only but the AD drove me manic so afterwards my maintenance dose rose to 300 to extinguish it. Then kept reducing it to 125 now and life is ok. I just wish it goes down to 50. BUT i couldn't. It seems because my depression went away that i have to attribute to seroquel. they say it's the only FDA approved for depression, so it's a mood stabilizer.the reason i wish to reduce it is to lessen the side effects , diabetes, cataract, etc...i gained some 20 pounds in weight. I guess i have to accept my destiny. Usually at the onset of a disease there is a denial, then you take drugs but then you don't lose hope that there will be a complete remission one day. then you accept what you have. but from time to time i read the latest news about BP. I don't forsee any advancements yet except few new AP's. I don't think either that they will make any breakthrough because it's the brain with the hundreds of neurotransmitters interacting.",

            "answer": "Seroquel is disgusting.I was up to 800mg a day and started weaning, took me 1.5 years.and many sleepless nights.Causes diabetes also.never ever again.Americans spend more than any other country in the world on Health care and meds yet we rank 37th in health.",

    "question": "it occurred to me that seroquel is frying my brain and changes it. I take risperidone 1mg and another AP (typical) 1mg. If i cut these two any time nothing will happen seriously except in the long run. In fact i did that many times in the course of my bloody illness. But as soon as i cut seroquel i feel it right away with my mixed states. I know each of these nasty drugs causes something or another but seroquel is by excellence the worst. Of course lithium is terrific in this regard (dehydration, tremors, renal....) tegretol same and depakote (cystic ulcers,) etc....etc... but seroquel is different. I took tegretol for a few months and quit cold turkey. But here i feel i am addicted to this drug. I take 125mg but can't dispense of it. I suppose the only advantage is that it works for depression so i gather better than taking AD's.IF ONLY I COULD REDUCE MY SEROQUEL at least a little bit",
