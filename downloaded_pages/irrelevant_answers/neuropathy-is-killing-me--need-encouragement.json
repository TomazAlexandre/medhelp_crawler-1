            "answer": "Hope!\u00a0\u00a0Long time no 'see'.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry you're having a hard time.What's the saying -- 'When all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.'\u00a0\u00a0I think docs are similarly bound by their speciality -- likely because they wouldn't have chosen a particular specialty if it didn't call to some internal aspect of their own world view.\u00a0\u00a0That's my dollar's worth of psychoanalysis for the day ........ and that psych who tagged you with 'somatization disorder' -- well, he too is a prisoner of his professional paradigm.\u00a0\u00a0To a psych, every physical ailment could well begin in the head.\u00a0\u00a0Phooey.Till you get the Lyme beaten down into a whimpering pile of smashed bugs, I wouldn't worry a lot about whether your aches and pains are Lyme-caused or psychological in origin.\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety is also common in Lyme, due to brain irritation and inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0Sure you could be manifesting psychological ailments in your body ... just like I'm totally stressed out lately, and my whole body aches sometimes from the stress.\u00a0\u00a0Is that somatization?\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, I guess.\u00a0\u00a0It goes away when I'm relaxed.If you feel it might help, then 'talk therapy' would be worth trying ... but if not, then continue focussing on the possible physical causes.\u00a0\u00a0Just don't let them bully you into thinking 'it's all in your head.'\u00a0\u00a0Lyme messes with the whole body, including hormones and emotions, and if you assume you don't have Lyme and are instead having psychological issues only, then you'll not kick the Lyme.\u00a0\u00a0So I'd be cautious about accepting a psychological diagnosis that then stops you from pursuing a physical source of the ailment.In brief:\u00a0\u00a0take care of the physical causes of your suffering, and when those are treated, then consider whether there is a psychological aspect.\u00a0\u00a0After being ill a long time, it does affect the mind, just as any major life upheaval would do, but that doesn't mean you don't have a physical illness.At least that's my take ... and since I'm NOT medically trained, it's easy for me to spout off.\u00a0\u00a0But cut yourself some slackDo you take magnesium supplements?\u00a0\u00a0It's very soothing.\u00a0\u00a0It helped me a lot when I was really sick with Lyme, and it might also help the other symptoms you are having.See what your LLMD says.\u00a0\u00a0He/she is the one with the insight.My approach would be to assume it's physically caused until a knowledgable doc (the LLMD) says otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0Take care, let us know what the doc says, okay?",

            "answer": "Neuropathy, that quickly caught my eye as I just had a doctor try to tell me that was what was causing the movement in my hands.\u00a0\u00a0Not.\u00a0\u00a0What I have is some very fine threadworms known as filaria, they can cause elephantiasis.\u00a0\u00a0Generally considered a tropical disease, but for several years I worked in a book making factory alongside many Yemenis.\u00a0\u00a0The disease is endemic there and one can be asymptomatic yet have it.\u00a0\u00a0All it would take is for a mosquito to bite the person who is carrying it, and then you.\u00a0\u00a0The filaria have this interesting little symbiotic bacteria known as wolbachia that causes swelling and inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0In my case there is lymph backed up below my hands and alongside the ulna.\u00a0\u00a0It looks like you, but press and you might find a fluid filled lymph duct.\u00a0\u00a0These wolbachia can also cause changes in skin texture and color, primarily by stimulating the formation of something known as Neutrophil Extracellar Traps, or NETS for short.\u00a0\u00a0In some these really look like nets, an example being a girl I know whose skin had a red mottled appearance.\u00a0\u00a0But the color was really in the lymph below her skin.\u00a0\u00a0These NETS are made to trap extracellular bacteria or larger things such as the filaria I have.\u00a0\u00a0These NETS however, also serve as protection for what's trapped on the other side.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to get drugs through them, so I found when my calves were recently nearly covered with them and worm medicine wouldn't get to where the worms were.\u00a0\u00a0I could kill them if they came out of there, but nothing went in unless injected in. It's also hard for other components of your immune system to get through the NETS.\u00a0\u00a0 Wolbachia are also carried by ticks.\u00a0\u00a0Wolbachia's drawing of neutrophils could be behind the bullseye rash.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, the good news is kill the bacteria you kill the filaria, they can't live or reproduce without wolbachia.\u00a0\u00a0Doxycycline does the wolbachia in.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases your immune system will be trying to disassemble the NETS, which of course are made of your DNA, so it appears to the doctor's test that you are making antibodies to self and they call it autoimmune.\u00a0\u00a0The rosacea of one of the supposedly autoimmune disorders, Lupus, stems from the production of NETS, and I'll bet wolbachia are involved somehow.",

The diagnosis of Lyme neuroborreliosis was delayed until bifacial paresis and right lower abdominal wall weakness developed, prompting further evaluation.Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) examination showed aseptic meningitis.Antibodies directed against Borrelia burgdorferi were present in the serum; higher titers were present in the CSF, indicating local antibody production.Electrophysiologic studies showed both an axonal polyradiculopathy as well as demyelinative facial palsy.Ceftriaxone therapy led to marked improvement in pain and facial palsies.PMID:8413380[PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]===================================Treatment options have likely expanded in the two decades since this was published.\u00a0\u00a0What does your doc say about treatments options?",
