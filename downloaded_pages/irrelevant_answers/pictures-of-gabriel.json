    "question": "I hate to take a thread, but couldn't resist telling you I have posted some pictures.\u00a0\u00a0I think the best ones are on 35mm, but I found a few to post.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for all the well wishes and kind words. Having him without pain meds was a decision I made just a week or so ago.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I could get periodic pain shots to help me through, but ended up only having one, which was a waste because it did nothing to help :)\u00a0\u00a0They were going to put me in the jacuzzi, but I dilated too fast within an hour or so, and they wouldn't because they were afraid I would go fast, and they were right.\u00a0\u00a0It was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life, and at the time didn't think I would be able to push him out.\u00a0\u00a0At one\u00a0\u00a0point I even told the doctor to just cut him out.\u00a0\u00a0He calmly told me it was a little too late for that :) and about 3 minutes later he was born.\u00a0\u00a0It couldn't have been more perfect!! Now I just have to tackle breastfeeding, and getting my milk to come in.Patty, Weston has had a cold (coughing, congestion) and did not visit the hospital after Saturday. Since we have been home he has only looked at him and has not gotten to close.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if he is waiting for me to say it is okay, or if he is just not interested.\u00a0\u00a0He did make the comment last night that Gabriels initials are GERC, and thought that was funny, so he is thinking about him.\u00a0\u00a0I am just being patient, and keeping my fingers crossed things will be better.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again everyone.\u00a0\u00a0Wishing all of you well.\u00a0\u00a0I can't wait to hear your stories, and see your beautiful babies in the upcoming weeks!!",
