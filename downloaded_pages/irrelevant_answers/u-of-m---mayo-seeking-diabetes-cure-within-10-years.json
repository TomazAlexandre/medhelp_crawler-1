            "answer": "Good read LM. Another ongoing 'diabetes cure' research is 'pancreatic islet cell transplant'http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/pancreaticislet/For those unaware of what islet cells do follow this rather brief synopsis. Insulin is a hormone that helps the body use glucose for energy. Diabetes develops when the body doesn't make enough insulin, cannot use insulin properly, or both, causing glucose to build up in the blood. Islets within the pancreas contain \u00dfeta cells. \u00dfeta cells are responsible for producing the right amount of insulin as needed. Having continuous levels >200 mg/dl destroys \u00dfeta cells, reducing insulin production. When \u00dfeta cells die off they are gone forever, not reproduced. By transplanting islet cells scientist are hoping \u00dfeta cells are replenished/resupplied [for lack of better words] thus restoring insulin production.",

            "answer": "Will it work this time? If I could answer that, I'd probably be a billionaire.Look on the bright side, 30, 60 years ago we did not have the technology to do this like we do now.A lot of medical research today is done by big pharma. Big Pharma's interest is not in finding any cures. Finding a cause can lead to no drugs needed. Big Pharma doesn't nessesarily want cures. They want us to be dependent on drugs, they love people with lifetime illnesses = big $.Doesn't look like this research is headed up by big pharma.The current research to many Autoimmune diseases is not sponsored in any way by the pharmaceutical business.Remember, one time the 'best' insisted that the world was flat too.In my opinion, this article is good news.\u00a0\u00a0: )",
