            "answer": "I believe blockages can form quite quickly in an artery, but it depends on how the blockage was formed. For example, it is obvious that a rupture can occur, even quite a small one which will form a clot in a matter of minutes. If you eat healthily, keep your cholesterol under control, there are still other factors which can cause a blockage. For example, you don't mention your blood pressure. If this is high, then you are more likely to form occlusions. Even if you have medication to keep pressure normal, stress at home can still cause it to rise. It may look good in the Doctors surgery, but at home it could be much higher. There is also believed to be a genetic factor. Some people just seem more prone to disease and I believe several genes have now been identified which differ us from people with high longevity (100+ yrs). If you picture the chemical and mechanical processes involved with atherosclerosis, I would have thought 18months is easily enough time.My first two angiograms, just 6 months apart, showed a huge difference in how much the disease had spread, especially the right artery which had formed a total blockage half way down.",

            "answer": "From personal experience, blocks to heart arteries can occur in a New York Minute, especially with those of us with Diabetes. Ed gives a good perspective.\u00a0\u00a0Inflamation of our arteries is considered a big reason for blockages to occur.\u00a0\u00a0I went through a very aggressive period of blockages, but it wasn't until I agreed to a very strict diet to control diabetes, took all the drugs, exercised daily that the blockages stopped.\u00a0\u00a0I agreed to lose a pound a month as the process of losing weight changes the metabolism and reduces inflamation of the arteries.\u00a0\u00a0I quit adding salt at the table, added good quality fish oil and quit eating beef and fatty pork.\u00a0\u00a0I also agreed to work out daily, and I lost 45 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0My blockages stopped. This may be what Kenkeith was alluding to, very tight control of diet, taking the good drugs, losing weight slows the CAD symptoms, at least they did in my case.\u00a0\u00a0I work as a volunteer at a Cardiac ICU unit, I can say from experience that most Cardiac patients in the ICU are diabetic.I'd suggest that your conclusion was incorrect, blockages can and do occur quickly.",

Have you ever researched contolled diabetes and CAD progression?\u00a0\u00a0If it is genetic, and that is the underlying cause, then that is somewhat against my understanding regarding risk control and the genetic proprensity for CAD.",

            "answer": "There is insufficient information in the original post to give any accurate reply. This is because there are different reasons for restrictions in coronary arteries. Atherosclerosis starts at a very young age, before teen years. Restrictions in coronary arteries are not only caused by plaque build up, there are other reasons. If a section of hard plaque (the cap) ruptures, exposing the softer material below, then a clot will form. Clots are not always 100% and some even break up and disappear on their own. This is what I believed must have happened in a recent post by someone who said they had a recent test which showed the blockage was gone. The endothelium can become irritated by plaque or a clot and fail to function properly. This means the artery may refuse to dilate, or may even constrict inappropriately. Clots take a matter of minutes to form, if they took years we would all bleed to death from a simple cut.",
