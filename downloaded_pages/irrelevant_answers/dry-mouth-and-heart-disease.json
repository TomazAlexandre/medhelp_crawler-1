    "question": "Is there any correlation between dry mouth and heart disease?\u00a0\u00a0Over the past couple of months my mouth and throat get so dry I have a hard time swallowing. I do have heart disease and it has been a few years since I was checked due to the fact that I do not have any insurance.\u00a0\u00a0This dry mouth/throat happens day and night so it is hard for me to associate it with anything related to my job or home. It also happens in the car so, again, there is no association that will bring it all together. I was just wondering if the dry mouth could be related to my heart disease and if it is what needs to be done?\u00a0\u00a0Sneaky1551",
