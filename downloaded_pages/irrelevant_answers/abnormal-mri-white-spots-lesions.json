            "answer": "Hi.These white matter lesions are presently non-specific, meaning, they don't portend to any specific diagnosis for now.\u00a0\u00a0However, these may be early changes for the diagnosis of demyelinating conditions such as multiple sclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, the true MRI features of MS will still become evident as the disease progresses, and I believe this is the reason why your doctor wants to have the tests done after a period of time (6 months).\u00a0\u00a0For now, it is best that you have adequate rest and avoid too much stress.Regards and God bless.",

            "answer": "Thank you so very much for your post! I am getting quite a bit of rest as I am experiencing a large decrease in energy. Stress is a bit less easier to manage due to my career; but am working on it. If I may ask another question...my neurologist suggested that I also see a GP and run through some cardiac testing. I haven't done this as of yet due to all of the other tests taken...would you recommend that I go ahead with that suggestion as well? I'm worried that I'll appear to be a hypochondriac!Thank you again for your time!Warmest regards and blessings.",

    "question": "Hello! I had an event where I got dizzy, had blurred vision, then a grey-out, numbness under my nose continuing to my lower lip. The next day, my left arm went numb. I had an MRI of the brain then a few days later had it repeated with contrast due to changes of prior lesions (from migraines?), an MRI of the spine with and without contrast. Ultrasound of the carotid arteries, blood work, and a VER (visual evoked response) test. Everything came back looking normal except the MRI due to \"white spots that appeared different than past MRIs\". My doctor wants to repeat the test in 6 months to see if they get larger or change. Unfortunately the nurse rushed off the phone line so I couldn't think quickly enough to ask questions in this regard. What can these 'white spots' be and what can cause them? My mom has a history of what was earlier thought of Inflammation of the Brain and vision impairment. She had every test known to man and this was the diagnosis. Her doctor now wants her to test for MS. She doesn't want to go through more tests. I'm just a bit concerned as to what could be causing my MRI to appear abnormal and the numbness comes back periodically in my left arm. Any insight would be greatly appreciated! Thank you for your time.",
