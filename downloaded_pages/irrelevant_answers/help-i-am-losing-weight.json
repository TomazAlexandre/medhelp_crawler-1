The doctor said she was not worried about the weight loss but did not want me to gain more than 9 lbs my entire pregnacy. The morning sickness makes me lose my appetite. Although now in 2nd trimester I'm feeling more hungry. I saw a fetal care specialist and she said she did not want me losing any more weight so I'm not sure what to think either. My baby is growing and I don't have high bp or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I think as long as you are healthy and the baby is healthy you will be fine.",
