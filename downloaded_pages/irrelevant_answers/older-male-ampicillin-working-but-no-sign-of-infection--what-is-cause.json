    "question": "Patient: mid 80's malePatient suddenly could not speak, move, was confused, kept falling, and was completely delirious. Although UTI culture came back normal there was slight positive reading in the culture so was put on antibiotics (ampicillin) within hours he returned to his original state. Full memory back, eating and showering on his own, lifting things up and no sign of dimentia. However every test during the attack and after attack show no sign of any infection, MRI was normal, cat scan normal, heart fully healthy, etc. Since the first attack this has happened 2 more times and each time it is a little worse. But every time he is given the ampicillin and within a day he is a gazillion times better and back to himself. Neurologist says everything is normal, cardiologist said he's healthy, geriatric suggested calling an infectious disease doctor but they refused to see him as his labs came back with no sign of infection. What should we do? We know it's clearly not finding the source of the problem by giving him the antibiotic if it keeps coming back. Any suggestions are much wanted.",
