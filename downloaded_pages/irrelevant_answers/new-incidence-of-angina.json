            "answer": "Sally,Thanks for the post.(1) From what you have described, you have new onset angina and mild heart failure symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0A cath (angiogram) at this point is appropriate and indicated.(2) Statins have been proven to reduce mortality in patients with CAD or CAD risk factors, like diabetes, even when total cholesterol is not elevated.\u00a0\u00a0The HPS study came out approximately one year agon in the Lancet, and clearly showed benefit even in those patients whose total cholesterol was not elevated.\u00a0\u00a0If I was seeing you, with the information provided, I too would place you on a statin.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Forgot to mention, my stent was placed at a point where two smaller arteries branch out that also had some minor blockage.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiologists have pointed to spasm of these smaller arteries as the reason for angina in the past.\u00a0\u00a0They say that spasm of these branch arteries is not life threatening, so if the angiogram shows spasm is likely to be the cause of my angina, they would monitor it with nitro.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your comments 3rdmajor.\u00a0\u00a0I did ask the cardiologist these questions but he was not my regular dr - he was just the first available appointment and my regular cardio guy didn't have anything for a month.\u00a0\u00a0And when I went into the ER a few weeks ago with the first episode one cardiologist recommended angiogram, and the 2nd said wait and see.\u00a0\u00a0So there doesn't seem to be a consensus, which is kind of nagging at me.\u00a0\u00a0I keep coming back to stress and my busy life and wondering if I can stop the symptoms if I take better care of those factors.Then again, there could be a blockage which should be dealt with.\u00a0\u00a0So I guess I am resigning myself to another cath (I had two in 2001).\u00a0\u00a0I just wish it didn't cost $20K to take that peek inside, even though insurance covers most of it.\u00a0\u00a0The stay in the ER and CCU a few weeks ago was $8K - that was for a whole 9 hours that I was there!The thing I find hardest about having CAD is that there's no definitive way to sort this stuff out without going to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0And with my history, they slap that IV in, start giving me all kinds of injections and stuff and so I really avoid it unless my body tells me 'time to go!'I'm hopeful that the angiogram will provide some answers.",

After the cath, they didnt want me to leave.\u00a0\u00a0I underwent 5x bypass, and they didnt bypass everything.So, \"fit as a horse\" in June, and critical in November.\u00a0\u00a0That sums up the current state of cardio diagnostics.Hard to believe that today's technology cant provide a non invasive method for assessing CAD.",

    "question": "I had a stent placed 30 months ago, due to 90% blocked LAD.\u00a0\u00a0Since then I've passed a stress echo and one with thallium injection, 7-8 minutes running each time.\u00a0\u00a0Thallium test was a routine one yr followup, the other 6 months out from the stent placement due to some recurrent angina.I'm a 42 yr old female, 6 yrs type II diabetes, normal blood pressure, total chol 100-125, HDL 30-40, high triglycerides, blood sugar control ok not great, A1C about 7.1.\u00a0\u00a0Meds are lisinopril 10 mg., glucophage and insulin as needed, multivitamin, CoQ10,aspirin.I've been symptom free 2 years until 2 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0Then I began having angina appear, in the morning, usually after I get the kids off to school, so after light activity, nothing heavy.\u00a0\u00a0It is relieved by nitroglycerin.\u00a0\u00a0Happens once or twice a day, almost always in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Not every day, but almost all. Also have noticed feet and ankles swelling in the morning and late at night, with none midday.In addition, I've had trouble sleeping flat in bed.\u00a0\u00a0If I lay flat, my chest feels uncomfortable, pressure and fast hearbeat feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I have to sleep propped up somewhat on pillows to get comfortable.Passed another stress echo with flying colors.\u00a0\u00a0The cardiologist wants a heart cath within a week, plus is adding metropolol and Zocor.2 questions - Is angiogram really necessary?\u00a0\u00a0Could angina be simply due to stress (busy family life, happy marriage, 3 kids but money stresses)? Part of me wants it to answer ??s, part says be conservative and wait.And why a statin when total cholesterol is not too far above 100?",
