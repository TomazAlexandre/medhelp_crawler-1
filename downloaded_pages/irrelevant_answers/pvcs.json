            "answer": "I've experienced something similar. I am 28 and I've been having PVCs for about 4 years now. When it first started happening I had an echo and a stress test and was told that they were nothing to worry about. They seem to come and go. When it first started happening I would have long runs of bigeminy and it really freaked me out. Then it seemed to go away, more or less, for a couple of years (I only felt them occasionally, anyway, who knows how many I wasn't feeling). But lately they are back with a vengeance. I mentioned it to my PCP at my last check up and she assured me that unless I start getting dizzy I should just try and ignore them. I try but it's hard sometimes, as I'm sure you all know.",
