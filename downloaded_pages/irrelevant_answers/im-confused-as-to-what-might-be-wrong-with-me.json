    "question": "Hello. I am a 23 year old female who has recently been told I no longer have iron-deficiency anemia.its been around a week since Ive no longer been anemic.However...I have noticed very odd symptoms and have been feeling sick. I don't know what if could be and I'm wondering if it might be diabetes. Here are my symptoms: hot and cold intolerance(my body temperature can't make up its mind), frequent urination, depression, anxiety, fatigue, floaters, heart palpitations/fast heartbeat-especially when eating sugar, dry skin, ringing in ears, confusion/memory loss, some nausea. Insomnia. Strong hunger pains even when I have eaten. And it seems as if I'm always dehydrated when I've had around 5 bottles of water a day. Lastly, occasionally when I go to sleep it seems as if I can't get up and have a heavy feeling as if I can't move. I'm not ruling out any other possibilities so any answers are welcome.",
