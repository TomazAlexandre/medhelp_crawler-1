            "answer": "It does sound a bit like gastritis and that possibility should be checked out. Has your doc suggested either doing a trial test of using anti-reflux meds, or possibly doing an upper endoscopy? If not, you may want to bring up the subject. In the meantime, it wouldn't hurt to follow a GERD-friendly diet. You can find a representative example at www.gicare.com in the 'diet' section.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the advice. I went to see my doctor, and has prescribed me with omeprazole. I have been referred to a gastroenterologist for a consultation, in which they'll decide whether an endoscopy or a barium x-ray should be ordered. I was worried about cancer, but I would probably have been really ill, lol.Thanks for the GERD-free recommendation. I will look into it, and take whatever action is needed in order to prevent GERD from coming back, followed by ulcer/gastritis complications.",
