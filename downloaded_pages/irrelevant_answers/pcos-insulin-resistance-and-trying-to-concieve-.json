            "answer": "It is hard to predict what each physician will say. The strategy will be to use fertility medicines to help you to ovulate, perhaps also with a diabetes medicine called glucophage which often helps women to ovulate along with fertility medicines. They may talk to you about weight loss as well. It is hard to predict exactly what your RE will advise, without knowing your clinical situation in great detail and without knowing that particular RE's preferences.",

    "question": "I am going to see a reproductive endocrinologist this week, I have a very long history of infertility that started about 5 yrs ago. After two years of infertility and weight gain I was diagnosed with Insulin resistance and told to do diet and exercise. I cont. to gain weight and developed a mass in my abdomen that was an ovarian cyst the size of a football about 2yrs ago they removed it along with my left ovary and fallopian tube and said that I would go back to normal now I believe it was because of my age I was 21\u00a0\u00a0but I didn't they tested my last year to see if I was ovulating after another yr of infertility and they said that my Right ovary wasn't ovulating and that is when they referred me to a RE. I am going but want to know what to expect them to say because I have all the above and weigh 290 what should I expect? I am now 24 yrs old.",
