            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, yes blood in mucus or stool is a cause of concern. While it can be due to IBS or Crohn's, it can also be due to hemorrhoids, cancer, polyps etc.You will probably need a colonoscopy to find the cause.Bloating etc can also be due to several other causes. Other than IBS or spastic colon you could be suffering from Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/ Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, diabetes, food intolerance, malabsorption syndromes, constipation, gallbladder and liver problems, pancreatic dysfunction, or taking a diet rich in sulfites. Cancers of the gut and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Take care!",
