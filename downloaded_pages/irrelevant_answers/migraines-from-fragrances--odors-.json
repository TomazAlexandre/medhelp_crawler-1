            "answer": "Hi there. I understand your predicament and concern. Your migraine attacks are triggered by fragrances and smells of various kinds. The two ways of avoiding an attack in a known case of migraine headaches is to avoid the triggers and the other to use medicines, which prevent an episode. The various other known triggers are stress, fasting, hormones, bright and flickering lights, odors, aged cheeses, chocolate, MSG and aspartame in foods. Your workplace and close encounters with people indulgent in fragrances appears to be unavoidable. You could consult your neurologist to advise and prescribe you any of the preventive medicines like beta-blockers, calcium channel blockers, tricyclic antidepressants, anti serotonin agents and anti convulsants. Your doctor would consider the side effects, drug-drug interaction, any co morbidities like diabetes, hypertension and cardiovascular disease.\u00a0\u00a0Drugs to treat an already present attack include triptans, ergots and midrin that are a combination of isometheptene, acetaminophen, and dichloralphenazone.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps. Take care.",
