            "answer": "Hi there.I'm sorry to learn that you are experiencing all of these.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that the possibility of MS cannot be really entirely ruled out as this is an evolving and progressing disease.\u00a0\u00a0The initial MRI's may not be diagnostic of such, but future scans may eventually be able to show the typical changes of MS.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that if you have other conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes or high cholesterol, that all of these are controlled as these may contribute to the compromising blood supply in the brain.I hope you and your doctors can get to the bottom of this soon.\u00a0\u00a0Regards and God bless.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your kind note.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure what to do next as my doctors seem to think this problem is depression.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I have to leave it and wait for awhile, although my benefits will likely end soon and I'm not sure how I can work full-time.I have had all the blood tests, and they are normal.\u00a0\u00a0I also had the visual evoke potential test and apparently it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I am really running out of ideas here.I guess I could ask them to do another MRI of my head.\u00a0\u00a0If that has changed - the last one was December 2007 - would I know for sure then?Do you have MS?\u00a0\u00a0What is your story?",

    "question": "I had an MRI that showed 15-20 lesions in my frontal and parietal lobes.\u00a0\u00a0The radiologist stated diagnostic of MS.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I have many clinical symptoms most of which are classic MS.\u00a0\u00a0Two neurologists state I do not have MS.\u00a0\u00a0They said the lesions are in the wrong place for MS. Apparently you need lesions to show in the corpus collosum or anterior fossa.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist thinks depression is causing my symptoms. I have never heard of these symptoms connected with depression.\u00a0\u00a0Except for the radiologist telling me I had MS five months ago which was very depressing, I am no more depressed than the average.\u00a0\u00a0What else can cause these type of lesions?\u00a0\u00a0In tellling me it is not MS nobody has told me anything about these lesions.A second MRI found no cervical or thoracic lesions.\u00a0\u00a0I have severe balance issues and use a cane as noise, traffic and movement cause me to get dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0I am tired and have difficulty concentrating or focussing on my work.\u00a0\u00a0I think this might be from the energy expended trying to maintain my balance but that's just me.\u00a0\u00a0The balance problems have been ongoing for four years.\u00a0\u00a0The ENT ordered the original MRI because except for meniere's he didn't have any ideas why this is ongoing.\u00a0\u00a0I had a severe attack of TN when I was 30.\u00a0\u00a0It lasted about a week and I was hospitalized and heavily medicated.\u00a0\u00a0Is this significant to the situation I currently face?I am hoping\u00a0\u00a0you might have some ideas for me to share with my doctors.",
