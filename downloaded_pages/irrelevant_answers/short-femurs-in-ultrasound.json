(ages 10, 8, 21 months - and another is on the way\u00a0\u00a0(due date 10-22-08))...\u00a0\u00a0I'm NOT quite 35 -\u00a0\u00a0I'm 32... but thought my question would pertain here better than a younger crowd...\u00a0\u00a0I've had pre eclampsia with all 4 pregnancies... as well as horrible morning sickness... and gestational diabetes with them all too...\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I'm currently (as of Aug 17th)\u00a0\u00a030 1/2 weeks along with this pregnancy..\u00a0\u00a0my gestational diabetes is worse this time..\u00a0\u00a0I'm on glyburide and watching my sugars very very closely...\u00a0\u00a0 I've gotten past the morning sickness stage THANK GOD... and I'm looking to find answers to a few questions I have.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0At 26 weeks gestation, I had an ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0They noted that my baby had \"short femurs\".\u00a0\u00a0 They based this on the BiPariatel Diameter Ratio...\u00a0\u00a0they said 70 was the low end of normal...\u00a0\u00a0my baby measured at 67.\u00a0\u00a0 They did a repeat ultrasound at 28 weeks -\u00a0\u00a0and found the same -\u00a0\u00a0only this time, we measured 69.\u00a0\u00a0 They noted NOTHING else out of the ordinary - but scheduled me for a Level II ultrasound which I had done at 29 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0At that ultrasound - the specialist and doctor spoke with me afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0They said that other than having a bit shorter femurs, nothing else was out of the ordinary...\u00a0\u00a0They told me that they don't use the BPD ratio when they look for things \"wrong\" with femurs -\u00a0\u00a0and that unless a baby has femurs that measure in the 5th percentile they really don't worry.\u00a0\u00a0We measured in the 9th to 10th percentile.Of course as a mom -\u00a0\u00a0I'm still worried...\u00a0\u00a0my doctor said not to worry -\u00a0\u00a0this thing happens... yada yada yada...\u00a0\u00a0 I didn't have the triple screen done with this pregnancy\u00a0\u00a0(odd... it was the ONLY pregnancy I didn't have one done with).\u00a0\u00a0I have never carried a baby past 34 weeks as a result of having preeclampsia -\u00a0\u00a0so I'm not going to risk anything and have an amnio done at this point.Is it ever \"normal\" to have short femurs??",
