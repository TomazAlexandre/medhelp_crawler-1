            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This rocking sensation could be vertigo. You must consult an ENT specialist. If ear is the cause of vertigo (rotator movement of self or environment) then it could be due to benign positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, vestibular neuronitis and labyrinthitis. Other causes of dizziness are otitis media, trauma, side effects of drugs, and fluid in ear. All these causes will have to be ruled out one by one by your ENT through specialized test. If it is blocked Eustachian tube, then doing a valsalva maneuver (Done by taking a deep breath and blowing while pinching your nostrils and closing your mouth) will help. This will help clear the secretions in the tube that connects the back of your throat with your ear. High blood pressure, TMJ, and compression of the cervical spinal nerve could also be a cause.The problem can also be often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",

            "answer": "how does one treat this if it is vertigo? Does it subside or does one need medication if head and neck exercises do not help?What can one do about it to afford relief besides walking, gym and rest? Poor sleep pattern could well be a factor. having been on Cilift, an antidepressant for generalised anxiety for many years is perhaps another reason. The GP did not find anything wrong with the ears and the CAT scan of the brain was normal. The general physician could not find anything wrong nor could the first neurologist. A second neurologist suggested exercises which have not changed anything yet. It has\u00a0\u00a0been suggested to try Sirk which is very expensive, but I have been told to wait before I try it. Can one have ear problems without really feeling anything major?Perhaps a visit to an ENT should be my next attempt. It really isn't any fun feeling this way for so many months and not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel. I would appreciate a response. Thank you.",
