            "answer": "Hello,If the doctors are recommending then your mother should get a medical abortion done. You should not worry and give additional support to your mother. Medical abortion can be done by vacuum aspiration or D+C.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
