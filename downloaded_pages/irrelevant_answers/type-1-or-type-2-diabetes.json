            "answer": "All very good questions.\u00a0\u00a0First some definitions.Type 1 Diabetes (also known as Juvenile Diabetes) is when your pancreas fails and no longer produces any Insulin.Type 2 Diabetes is when your pancreas still produces Insulin but your body does not use it as effectively as it should.For this reason Type 1 is considered more serious but both are treatable and controlable so that the person may live a relatively or almost completely normal life.\u00a0\u00a0It is always possible to go from Type 2 diabtes to Type 1 Diabetes but never the reverse.\u00a0\u00a0Many times a Type 2 Diabetic will be treated as a Type 1 (on the same medications etc) but will not actually BE a Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Reason being the treatments for a Type 1 are also effective on a Type 2 if that severity of treatment is needed.\u00a0\u00a0It is believed that Type 2 can be prevented or delayed in its onset by proper diet and exercise just like you would do if you actually had Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know there is no way to prevent Type 1.",
