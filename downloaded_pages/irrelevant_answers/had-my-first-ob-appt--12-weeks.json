            "answer": "Aren't we the lucky ones :-O)Actually I already did the glucose fasting test a couple of years ago so I think the gestational diabetes test is going to be the same kind of idea. ALTHOUGH having said that I didn't used to have to eat every couple of hours then so this should be interesting.From what I gather about c-sections if they're planned you probably have a slightly easier time than if you go into labour for a while then it turns out you need an emerg c-section.\u00a0\u00a0It's just such a longer recovery ...... although having said that my girlfriend had a normal l&d but ended up with an episiotomy that she said the recovery for that wasn't a barrel of laughs either.\u00a0\u00a0My other girlfriend had 3 c's (1 emerg due to breach then the next 2 planned due to breach) I'll have to pick her brains about tips & tricks for recovery.We really can't win.",

I think it'd be fair to at least let you TRY to give birth vaginally but also know that a c-section is most likely and go in with a good attitude.I have to have the glucose test every trimester. I passed the first one (I took it when I was around 8 weeks). You do drink the Glucola or whatever they give you (I had \"Fruit Punch\"--- so nasty!).",

Although, I personally was actually born on my due date.I've had high bp since I was 27 (been on medication since and now am on aldomet considered one of the safer ones during pregnancy, and have been tagged as pre-diabetic for the last four years. And I'm in my advanced maternal years......lovely.So we're hoping that my blood pressure remains stable and that I don't get hit with pre-eclampsia and that I don't develop gestational diabetes because of my insulin resistance issues.....plus I'm overweight but I am being very careful about weight gain during pregnancy.Joanne",

    "question": "So,I had my first appointment with my ob, previously I had been seen by the maternity clinic in the hospital (10 doctors that share the baby delivering duties - whoevers on call) they ordered my quad screen, toxo tests, prenatal screening testsOf course the only time my bp has been bad since getting pregnant is while in her office - 3 times in a row - so she upped my bp meds. Urgh. I'm supposed to be tracking and logging it now. She's also going to be sending me for my gestational diabetes screen next month I think - about a month or two earlier than the regular person goes?She let me know that there's now way with my health issues and potential issues that we'll be going one minute over my due date which she moved up by a day, now its October 19th. I'm to prepare myself mentally for a c-section.I've always thought I would have a c-section but lately I've been preparing myself mentally for a v-birth so now I'm back to preparing for a c-section. I told her about my sister's birth and I think that sealed the deal....my sister had a 12lb10oz baby boy, where she was overdue, induced, in labour forever then they figure out oops, he can't come out so we'll do a c-section...... my nan told my sister the gals in the family have BIG babies. nightmare.One positive note is that I got to hear the heartbeat and send a recording to my hubby. It was 165. It was funny she said its hit and miss and usually she misses but she found it on first attempt almost.",
