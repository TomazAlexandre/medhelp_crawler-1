            "answer": "What are your Labs reference range, please.Doctor treating you by FT-4 and not TSH? Nothing wrong with doing so in certain cases. However looks like you might have a wide spread between your FTs, depending on you Labs reference range.\u00a0\u00a0What was your FT-3 with theFT-4 at 0.41?Here is some info. for you.The available evidence suggests it is prudent to avoid low levels of thyroid hormone in the mother during the early part of pregnancy.Current information suggests that the requirement for thyroid hormone increases rapidly during the first half of the pregnancy, often during the first 10 weeks. After 20 weeks of gestation, thyroid hormone requirements are comparatively more stable.Researchers estimate that in early pregnancy the true reference range for TSH is 0.1-2.0 mIU/L. In particular, levels higher than 2.0 may indicate thyroxine or T4 deficiency for the developing fetus.According to research, during a normal pregnancy, the following are the TSH normal ranges for an iodine-sufficient population without autoimmune antibodies...First Trimester: 0.24 - 2.99Second Trimester: .46-2.95Third Trimester: .43 - 2.78Helps this helps you to your own conclusion.GL",

    "question": "I'm 29 weeks pregnant. I progressively became weaker, more fatigued, and achey in the 2nd trimester. My TSH was normal, about 1.2. I had a FT4 done and intially it was 0.41. My internist put me on Synthroid 50mcg. My follow up labs at 4 weeks are TSH 0.64, FT4 of 0.53, FT3 265.\u00a0\u00a0He also suggested an MRI of my brain but said he suspects that it is not pituatary, that it's just the pregnancy. He also wants to do another thyroid panel in 2 weeks before increasing my Synthroid. Most if not all of my symptoms have resolved. FYI I have also developed gestational diabetes. Do you see any pattern here, or is this just something that can happen in pregnancy? Should I see an endocrinologist? My ob swears I should only be on Synthroid if my TSH is elevated.",
