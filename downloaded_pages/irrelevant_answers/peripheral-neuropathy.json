            "answer": "Unfortunately about 30% of peripheral neuropathies remain undiagosed, this number is dropping as scientific breakthroughs come out, and more advanced testing is available.I'm not sure how they know that there is demyelination (perhaps on biopsy or EMG?). It is important to exclude conditions such as diabetes, a paraneoplastic syndrome (as it is associated with cancer in most cases, test by blood antibodies), HIV, Lyme, sarcoid, Vitamin deficiency, endocrinological disorders, monoclonal proteins, and testable autoimmune conditions like sjogrens disease. All these can be tested for by blood or spinal fluid tests.Recently we are aware that an skin biopsy looking at epidermal nerve fibers can reveal abnormalities when regular nerve biopsies and other studies are negative. It is only done is specialized centers such as the Cleveland Clinic Neuromuscular Department.Also some autoimmune demyelinating neuropathies have antibodies related to them which can be tested for in the blood such as anto-MAG antibody. It is important to come to a correct diagnosis in order to find the best treatment, that being said, treatment options are limited anyway in immune neuropathies (IVIG, plasmapheresis, steroids, cytoxan). Most autoimmune neuropathies involve the motor nerves so this is somewhat atypical and would call into question the diagnosis (and the fact that he has not responded to treatment)Perhaps a second opinion at a neuromuscular tertiary referral center might help?",

            "answer": "Hello, in 1989 I developed a heavy feeling in my legs, cold sweats shallowed breathing.\u00a0\u00a0I was referred by my family doctor to a neurologist and initially was diagnosised with Gillian-Barre.\u00a0\u00a0Sparing the details I eventually went home, but the residual effect is peripheral neuropathy, burning feet, loss of sensition and eventually will consume muscle.\u00a0\u00a0There are other complication that are directed to my particular case. I have been on every medication you can think of.\u00a0\u00a0But check with your father to see if he has been exposed to any chemical, gases or anything that was maybe even a onetime event that he can recall of.\u00a0\u00a0Trying not to paint an ugly picture, but unless more studies can be conducted we must live with some discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0There are meds that can help.\u00a0\u00a0Use narcotics as a last resort.I suspect your father regrets the biopsy because I did.\u00a0\u00a0Also try B-12 but follow up with the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Good-luck, because it can be treated.\u00a0\u00a0Treat the Symptoms at this point",

            "answer": "Sorry to take so long to get back to you but I happen to be along the Alabama Gulf Coast and we tend to lose power from time to time as our electric company trys to put us back together after the Hurricane.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect I may be to late to answer your question, but my personal experience involved the neurosurgeon removing about 1.5 to 2 inches of nerve on the backside of my left ankle where the nerve ends.\u00a0\u00a0It has caused as much pain as the PN itself.\u00a0\u00a0It was elective and I did it but I never was told that for the rest of my life I would have this raw,numb,painful area along the side of my foot.\u00a0\u00a0And to top it off, the biopsy was incunclusive. Being that I have had PN for so long I am now having other complications.\u00a0\u00a0Last year I was Diagnosised with Chacot-Marie-Tooth which has become a real challenge.\u00a0\u00a0I'am trying to make some decisions about footware.\u00a0\u00a0Don't misunderstand me that CMT has anything to do with PN but my doctor thinks so. I also found out that I have type 1 diabetes, which I control by diet.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this gives you the opportunity to know this if your biopsy is done like mine was.\u00a0\u00a0This is what I was referring to .\u00a0\u00a0Maybe this procedure has changed, but it's worth knowing.\u00a0\u00a0Good-luck.",

            "answer": "I too had Guillian-Barre Syndrome and was also misdiagnosed with having Charcot Marie Tooth MD since I exhibited some neuropathy that was possibly existent before the onset of GBS. There is a chronic form of GBS called CIDP Chronic Inflammatory Demylineating PolyNeuropathy and it responds to IVIG, Prednisone and PlasmaPheresis. I found out after 12 years that I had CIDP and not MD. Big difference. Shop around with different Neurologists, I have seen people with treatable immune system related neuropathies diagnosed with muscular dystrophy. If I had begun treatment years ago for the problems I had I might have never progressed to the state I am at today.You can also get genetic testing to rule out CMT. Sorry to hear they got you on that nerve biopsy, alot of people seem to get those without being informed properly of the risk-benefit.",
