            "answer": "Being afraid usually only last until you've got the first shot done and out of the way.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor has a plan for you before you start tx, most likely to increase your chances and to help you health wise.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is you would have to take the Metformin and Lipitor with or without the tx.\u00a0\u00a0My point is for you to start on the prescriptions and do whatever else he says and educate yourself about the HepC tx so you will know what you are up against.\u00a0\u00a0There is alot to learn about HepC and you chose the right forum, now you need to read around and educate yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Truly you will not know how easy or difficult the tx will be until you start.\u00a0\u00a0Your main focus now should be to get your health at it's optimum level.\u00a0\u00a0Then you can make up your mind about the how and when of txing your HepC.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",

    "question": "I am 58 years old (female) and\u00a0\u00a0I weigh 203 lbs. I was recently diagnosed with hep c. I also have high cholesterol and a fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0My glucose is 116 and A1C is 7. My liver biopsy is stage 2, grade 2, no cirrohsis.My gasto doctor told me that I have a 40% chance of cure on standard treatment because of my other health problems. He suggested Metformin and lipitor as treatment for my fatty liver and then I could go on the interferon and copegus treatment. I am very confused at this point. I am afraid to start these drugs. Can I take this medication with the hep C treatment. I want to cure the hep C. What should I do?",
