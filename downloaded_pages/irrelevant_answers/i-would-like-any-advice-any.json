            "answer": "My advice is hang in there and you know your body better than anyone. Sometimes dr's rely to heavily and if tests are normal they write you off. The fact is sometimes it takes\u00a0\u00a0time to get a diagnosis, I am two years with muscle twitching,tingling,weakness muscle wasting and no diagnosis. Sometimes you have to seek multiple opinions and be your own advocate. Mya",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply, its so unfair to get understanding...I have had 3 major illnesses in my life which have all taken over two years to diagnose, and 1 which i went to 7 different doctors because i couldn't move my neck and had a abcess that could of killed me any minute. You are right you know when something is wrong...just getting someone to listen is half the battle....if you had your arm in plaster someone would go you poor thing...but not when you look okay",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Yes it is quite possible that your symptoms are due to CFS or chronic fatigue syndrome. It usually follows a viral infection and is characterized by muscles aches and pains.Another possibility is fibromyalgia which causes muscle spasms, cramps and tingling and twitching muscles.You have mentioned 8 foci were seen on MRI. Where exactly are these foci?Please elaborate.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply, i really really apreciate it....the report said a number of T2 hyperintensities are demonstrated in the subcortical and deep white matter of both cerebral hemispheres. these have no distingushing characteristics with the largest lesion situated in a right subcortical location superior to the posterior aspect of the sylvian fissure measuring 3mm. There are approximately 8 foci of signal change in total...................except for an incidently noted prominent cisterna magna. there is a 9mm simple pineal cystThank you look forward to your reply",

            "answer": "Hi,Your MRI report indicates a number of white matter lesions. The white matter lesions can occur due to high BP, chronic headache, migraines, old age, diabetes, alcoholism, smoking, and Alzheimer\u2019s disease and multiple sclerosis.It is very difficult to diagnose if these lesions are due to MS since your symptoms are also not clear cut.A follow up MRI after 6 months will help in diagnosing the exact cause of these white matter hyperintensities.Hope this helps!",

            "answer": "Hi,Yes it is possible to get more lesions or for the existing lesions to increase in size. If there is a progression in lesions it increases the chances that these lesions are due to demyelinating disease like MS.There is a equal possibility of these lesions to remain unchanged.",

    "question": "Hi, i have obviously had an Mri because the neurologist thought i needed it to rule out MS. I have un explained arm weakness, tiredness some twitching and tingling. and a few other unexplained symptoms...I do not have the mri report here but it said i had 8 foci and one lesion measuring 3mm a 9mm pineal cyst. the conclusion was delimynation could not be ruled out. My neuroligist though i would have mg, but the test came back normal, so he told me today that my mri was completely normal. and thinks i should look at chronic fatigue.Is it normal, and should i be now thinking this way, i am 29",
