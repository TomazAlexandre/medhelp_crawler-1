            "answer": "He's eating and drinking fine, the only thing is the hair loss, he's not out of sorts, usual cuddly self.\u00a0\u00a0Don't know about potty as he goes out for that.\u00a0\u00a0Might keep him in for a couple of nights and see.\u00a0\u00a0He did shed about four years ago after being in a cattery for 3 months and took about a year for it to settle, we put that down to being in the cattery, although they were lovely and he got lots of cuddles, then moving into a new home.\u00a0\u00a0We got a puppy a few months ago, but they're not really interested in each other and tend to ignore each other.\u00a0\u00a0He's also in charge, allowed on the sofa and beds and the dog isn't, but wonder if he's a bit stressed.",

            "answer": "Stress, I would guess, could be a cause of hair loss-hey, it is for us!!\u00a0\u00a0It's a very good idea about keeping him in for a few days.\u00a0\u00a0He might drive ya nuts, though, but it would be worth it!!\u00a0\u00a0LOL.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid issues could show up as constipation or diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0And, you didn't mention whether there's been any weight changes. For peace of mind, I'd take him to the vet and ask for a thyroid test, and he's probably got more ideas as to some other possible causes!Let me know how everything goes!",
