            "answer": "Hi and welcome,To be honest it doesn't sound like MS to me, i don't know much about those conditions or if they're associated with crohn's or diabetes but as far as i'm aware they're not associated with MS at all, i do know that bone edema if not caused by a stress injury can also be due to a secondary inflammatory injury of bone eg infection or arthritis. Sorry to not be of much help!Cheers...........JJ",

    "question": "I have had debilitating pain and weakness in my hips low back and quads. The pain is present almost always but it also comes on fast and strong, a number 10 on a pain scale as if it's a flare of sorts. When the pain is at its worse, I also have do imitating fatigue and can barely function. My eyes get blurry and they feel full and painful. I've had migraines for years and this does not feel like my typical migraine. My legs have become very week in less than three months and if I bend over, I feel unbalanced and as if I might topple over. My legs fatigue very easily as well as my sciatic joint area of my low back. The quad pain came on very slowly from feeling it as slight pain a year ago or so. It then moved to the hips and low back and now I have the pain all the time to varying degrees. Three doctors at Kaiser cannot agree as to what I have. I had a lumbar MRI with no contrast and it revealed edema inside my bones, bursitis and tendinitis but none of that describes the flare type, migratory pain and weakness. I asked too see a neurologist and rheumatologist and my doctor said I didn't need to see either one. I'm switching doctors next week. I ann 55 year old female with type 1 diabetes and Crohn's disease. Thank you so much for any input.",
