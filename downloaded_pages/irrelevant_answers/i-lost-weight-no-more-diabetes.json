            "answer": "How often you test isn't what's important. What's important is recognizing that though you lost weight and got your numbers down (congratulations by the way!) you will always have the tendency to insulin resistance and diabetes. It is important to maintain your healthy weight and continue eating in a more diabetes-friendly way (eliminate sugar and lower carb intake), as well as get regular exercise.",

            "answer": "I took care of a lady who lost almost two hundred pounds and her doctor still tests her every three months in the lab, she doesnt have to test at home but I thought she should now and then, since her doctor said she didnt have to we watched for any changes in mood, general health and suden different over all feeling, like a rush or dizzyness, she seemed ok while we had her here and as long as she did ok in her three month blood work, her doc though she was ok not to, Is all up to you and how you feel cos test strips are expensive too. If you are doing well with diet you might be ok if you ask your doc for blood work often enough, but that is not my recommendation either, just a thought.",
