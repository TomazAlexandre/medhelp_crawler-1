            "answer": "if you are asking what happens in the body when insulin production is low? First we have to talk about what is normal process.\u00a0\u00a0First our body requires glucose (sugar) in our body to function.\u00a0\u00a0our brain can use sugar directly for energy.\u00a0\u00a0sugar mostly comes from the food that we eat (something called carbohydrate).\u00a0\u00a0we digest the food, in the small intestines, it gets absorb into the blood stream as glucose (sugar).\u00a0\u00a0The pancreas is the organ that produces insulin and release into blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is a hormone that acts as a key to open the cells so the sugar can go into the cells as tranform into energy.\u00a0\u00a0 When the production of insulin is low, you will have sugar trapped in the blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0when you test your blood sugar using the glucometer, the number you see reflects on how much sugar is trapped in the blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0hope this is what you are looking for!\u00a0\u00a0if you are looking for something more, please be more specific with your question.",
