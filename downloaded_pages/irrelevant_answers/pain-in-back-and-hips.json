            "answer": "Could be your joint pain and numbness in your hands is coming from a couple things totally unrelated to neurology, and that's diabetes and vitamin b deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0A regular doc should run some blood tests to check your sugars and your vitamin levels.But hon, I have to say, I was in a car accident, and have had nothing but trouble with my spine and emotions as a result of it, a lifelong problem.\u00a0\u00a0So, I know exactly what you're talking about when you feel all this lower back and hip pain!!!\u00a0\u00a0I have terrible lower back pain, I feel it when I wake up in the morning, and it lasts for hours, most of the morning, almost unbearable, and during the day when I have to be standing for very long.\u00a0\u00a0But I take medicines.\u00a0\u00a0Lyrica worked really well for me, helped me sleep better, and for a couple years there, it took the pain away.\u00a0\u00a0But naturally things got worse and now I'm waiting to see my neuro about changing my meds.If you want to, you can ask your doc if he will do an ordinary black & white X-ray of your hips, just in case, and throw in a couple lumbar spine views, too, it's very inexpensive, even the Urgent Care place can do it for you.\u00a0\u00a0Ask for a copy of your pictures, nowadays they'll put them on a disk, and keep them.\u00a0\u00a0This is because if you don't have diabetes or vitamin deficiency, then you'll want to take the X-rays to a neurologist or orthopedist, those docs MAY see something that's been missed.A little on your pain meds.\u00a0\u00a0In general docs are VERY reluctant to give pain drugs, so whomever has given the ones you have to you, keep seeing that doc as a regular thing.\u00a0\u00a0You should take the meds you have, look and see if there's a refill within the current date.\u00a0\u00a0If you are indeed concerned with addiction, you could maybe just take some on weekends, so you can finally and regularly really rest good, your body cannot take constant pain.\u00a0\u00a0Also, heat helps pain, so you could get in a really nice hot bath, too, or put a hot water bottle or heating pad where it hurts.",
