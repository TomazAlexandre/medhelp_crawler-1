I lost 10lbs in 7 days, vomited uncontrolably, even with Zofran.. Could not sit down, and nervously paced around everywhere. Body turned pale, and over all was just wiggging out!!! Doc ordered me off meds immediately, as he thought I had an allergic reaction. The sx's you are describing are not normal.My first go round was absolute hell, and I had no intention of attempting tx again. First round was with redipen, and 1000mg Riba.6 months later, I tried tx again, Pegasys/copeg.. Went 32 weeks without the slighest of sx's, and cleared.. I'm 8 months post tx, and still undetectable.I would recommend discussing tx options with your Dr IMMEDIATELY.. If you are unable to hold fluids and food down, your not doing any service to your body.. Talk to Dr about switching interferons.. Thats what did it for me.Best of luck",

I was told that roughly 33% of transplant recipients develop diabetes but, in retrospect, I wonder if, because HCV is the leading reason for TP, HCV that might factor into the percentage. The 33% number was told to me by a doctor after transplantation and I never researched it so I'm not really too smart about this subject.

            "answer": "I don't \"have\" to take shots but I prefer to. When I was first diagnosed I was on oral meds - I think it was Glucotrol or something like that. After a while I asked whether insulin might be a more benign approach than meds which, to my understanding, either inhibit the liver or stimulate the pancreas. At the time I researched this subject pretty thoroughly but I can't recall much of it now. Anyway, I am not over weight, my triglycerides are low & my cholesterol is very low (95 to 130) so I could pretty much eat what I want as long as my glucose is controlled. At the time I switched to insulin I was on TX and had a lot of nausea and couldn't eat hardly anything. I asked my doctor if I ate a donut in the morning and covered it with insulin would that be okay. He said it was better than not eating anything and voila - I was shooting insulin. This doctor was my PCP (of sourse, I cleared this with transplant too) and he asked if it would bother me to give myself shots. I almost laughed as I told him that I was shooting Pegasys and Epogen every week and that didn't bother me too much so I thought the baby insuln shots would be bearable. Can-do, I am tightly controlled - my average glucose reading is under 105 and I test at least 5 times a day and most days 6 or 7. I want to see my before meal # and my post prandial # and especially when I have drug changes or dose adjustments. I am probably considered compulsive about my diabetes but remember I got this after transplant and there was so much testing and meds taking that the diabetes just sort of fit into to the new regime that I had to adhere to. Boy, that was long winded. But I always hear people say \"my diabetes isn't that bad - I don't have to take insulin\". I cringe when I hear that because, generally speaking, diabtets isn't good or bad - it's either controlled or not controlled and I really don't care much how it is controlled as long as it IS CONTROLLED. That's my rant. Mike",
