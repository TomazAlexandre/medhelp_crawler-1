            "answer": "The answer to that is a resounding YES........You need to get her Free T3 and Free T4 levels checked, along with thyroid antibodies - TPOab and TGab.TSH is actually a pituitary hormone and is not totally indicative of what the thyroid is doing.\u00a0\u00a0The \"free T's\" are the actual thyroid hormones in the blood and are what is readily available for the body to use.\u00a0\u00a0Without knowing what those levels are, you really have no idea what's going on.The antibody tests will determine if there's an autoimmune disease present.\u00a0\u00a0With type I diabetes, which is also autoimmune, it wouldn't surprise me a bit for her to have another (or even more) autoimmune.\u00a0\u00a0I, personally, have 2 - Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and pernicious anemia (b12 deficiency).It would also be good to have an ultra sound to see if there are any nodules on the thyroid.If you can't get her current endo to check anything further, it might be good to find a different endo.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of endos specialize in diabetes, not thyroid, (even though they are both dealing with the endocrine system) so you need someone who is willing to get off the old thinking that TSH is the \"end all, be all\" of thyroid diagnosis.By the way -- just out of curiosity, what was her TSH?\u00a0\u00a0The new range is 0.3-3.0, even though some labs (and doctors) still go by the old ranges, so if her TSH is in the lower part of the range, I'd definitely seek further help.Good luck",

            "answer": "Thanks for you response to my question Barb, My daughters TSH\u00a0\u00a0was 1.4\u00a0\u00a0in Sep 20082.2 in in march 2009\u00a0\u00a01.1 July 2009\u00a0\u00a0, I wonder if the TSH is a constant , or normally there is a variation in the numbers.Her anti-TPO is <10 IU/ml .I live in Canada and it seems that the T3 and T4 are not part of the normal testing. I would like to have them tested to rule out hyperthyroidism.The Endo she sees is the third one she has seen as we had quite a problem finding one who new anything about Addison's disease.Since being diagnosed with Addison'sdisease 1 1/2 years ago she has had heart\u00a0\u00a0an intermitant rapid heart rate, feels her heart is pounding. When lifting and object\u00a0\u00a0eg the cat, it set her heart pounding, her resting heart rate is often over 100 bpm.It seems very difficult to get the doctors to do further testing to find what the problem is.thanks again for any input you can givejill",
