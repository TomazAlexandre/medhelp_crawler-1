            "answer": "Wow, yeah that is really big for a 4 year old. She could have diabetes. But, I would start with what the doctor said and closely monitor what she eats. When I was pg the only thing that curbed my appetite was a ton of vegies. Cut out pop and sweets for the most part. Don't go cold turkey because a 4 year old wont understand and will be upset about it.",

            "answer": "Thank you sooo much for that info, very helpful. My sister feeds her lots of vegies and fruit but it's when she's with other family members or @ daycare that don't moniter her or give in to her 'cute faces' asking for food that's a prob. She's taken her 2 the doctor and they ask her to stop feeding her so much...which she doesn't but alas she sneaks it. So besides diabetes is there any other type of disease you may know of that gives her such an insatiable appetite?",

            "answer": "There are 2 other things I can think of that cause that kind of appetite. 1 is hypoglycemia. It is the opposite of diabetes. My husband has it and when he lived with his parents he did not eat healthy and he ate all the time. When we moved in together he lost 100 lbs because we ate a lot more healthy. Practically no candy, red meat, and excess carbs. He still eats a ton, but he also has a more regular eating pattern. He has specific times that he eats each day and that helps him control his appetite.2 is that she could have depression. People self medicate by eating all the time. Especially with comfort foods. If she is sneaking food the only way to get her to stop is to just stop keeping the bad food in the house. In my husband's case he has BOTH depression and hypoglycemia which are not a good mix. It took a lot of time but he got it under control and has been able to maintain a healthy weight for several years now. Although rare, it is possible for a 4 year old to be depressed.",

            "answer": "I was just researching the same thing. Don't feel alone, my daughter just turned 4 in Nov and she ways 61 pounds and is just over waist high on me. Chunky but not totally out of control. I have to get her out of the kitchen all day long. We limit the quantity and type of food she eats but she sneaks stuff all the time if she can. Thanksgiving she at two helpings of most things and then 15 minutes after we got up from the table she was telling me hungry. I hope your sister can figure out a cause. She isn't alone!=) Staci",

    "question": "My 4 yr old niece has an insane appetite! She is always hungry and never seems to have enough! She is also overweight for her age... I think...she's a little over 3 ft tall and weighs 63 lbs!! Could she have some type of disease/infection, eatin disorder? She NEVER gets full and sneaks food when no one is watching. What can we do? She is only 4 yrs old and we want to get under control before she gets older. The doctors just tell my sis to watch her eating....what kind of tests/exams should we ask for? Thank you so much in advance!",
