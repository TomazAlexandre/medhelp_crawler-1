    "question": "Well I had an level 2 u/s yesterday and my son is healthy thus far.\u00a0\u00a0And Im feeling blessed. This baby is not something I am taking for granted I am embracing every moment of this pregnancy....the good, the uncomfortable, etc.\u00a0\u00a0We did confirm he is indeed a boy and AGAIN he was laying in a odd position that made the u/s tech have a tough time until the periontologist came in to help out.\u00a0\u00a0And I couldnt get him to move....and normally he moves around all the time. My next appt in 4 wks I do my gestational diabetes testing.\u00a0\u00a0And Im not worried but you never know. :-) My feelings right now are just THANKFUL and BLESSED.\u00a0\u00a0And now I need to start my registry for showers coming up in the coming months.....",
