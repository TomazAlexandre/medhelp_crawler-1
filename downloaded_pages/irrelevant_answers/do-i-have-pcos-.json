            "answer": "Please first just calm down.\u00a0\u00a0In order to have PCOS you should have 2 of the 3 symptoms:\u00a0\u00a0irregular periods, follicles on ovaries by u/s, and hirsutism (increase in body hair).\u00a0\u00a0Many (but not all) people are also overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed because I had 17 follicles on each of my ovaries and a lengthy history of irregular cycles (33-54 days, but even longer when I was in my teens).\u00a0\u00a0PCOS is caused by insulin resistance therefore the treatment for it is simple - metformin.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes this helps a lot, sometimes not.\u00a0\u00a0PCOS can make conceiving difficult because your periods are unpredictable and you will have fewer periods than a normal person in any given year.\u00a0\u00a0Also if your cycles are long, it is possible that the egg is \"geriatric\" by the time the sperm come along and this too would make conceiving hard.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that you did have 12 on each ovary does not mean you have PCOS but is something to think about if you have any of the other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0And remember this is a syndrome(a collection of symptoms) - not a disease.\u00a0\u00a0It is nothing to be scared about.",

            "answer": "oh and there is a certain number of follicles they are supposed to see by ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0I can't remember how many but maybe more than 10-12 of a certain size??\u00a0\u00a0ALso just another note, my OB said follicles are totally normal and no big deal if you have no other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It was only when I went to the reproductive endocrinologist and she asked about my other symptoms that they found/thought I have PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0SO if you have normal cycles you are probably fine.",

I am a \"normal\" body wieght, no extra hair, and very regular cycles... I guess i am okay then. God knows how long for the doctor to call back and tell me what he thinks from looking at my ultrasound photos, I wont worry anymore though\u00a0\u00a0: )THank you so much for the input, I really appreciate the time to give me all that info, I feel better\u00a0\u00a0now.

            "answer": "No, each cycle a typical woman will have 4-5 follicles develop and then one becomes dominant and that is the one you will ovulate.\u00a0\u00a0Since your cycles are very regular I would highly doubt you have PCOS!!\u00a0\u00a0No need to worry!!",

It is totally normal, and if you didn't have them, there would be cause for concern.BTW, i've been tested 10, 11, and 12 dpo and got BFN on all of them (FRER).\u00a0\u00a0I may test the next to days but I really think it is a waste.\u00a0\u00a0Mentally I've alredy moved on to next cycle.",

    "question": "I am little freaked out. I had an ultra sound at 11 DPO and It showed 12+ follicles on each ovary.\u00a0\u00a0THe tech said it is normal to see this, that follicles sit on the ovaries and each month one matures, and the ones that dont mature just sit there waiting for the next month. I have never heard anything like that.Someone mentioned that 12+ follicles that far after ovulation is not normal, that it is a lot to have and maybe I have PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0I do not take any fertility aids.What are the symptoms of PCOS?\u00a0\u00a0If I do have this, is it harder to get pregnant????\u00a0\u00a0Is there a treatment??",
