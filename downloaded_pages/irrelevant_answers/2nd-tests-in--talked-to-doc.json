            "answer": "I would be VERY careful when it comes to autoimmune hep, by that I mean be very careful getting that diagnosis, if true it will bar her from treatment. Is the doctor a Heptologist? If not, I'd try to see a heptologist if I was you (her) because it is very important to rule out autoimmune hep if it is suspected. Is this doctor a Gastro? Some of the things you have said make me wonder how much he knows about Hep C, but maybe Im just reading it wrong. To me you don't suggest autoimmune hep unless you know the patient actually has it, that isn't a diagnosis you arrive at without proper testing.What exactly is he using to diagnose that condition? To accurately diagnose autoimmune hepatitis the doctor needs to be making the diagnosis from a liver biopsy and other tests.If I was you I'd do some research on it. Here is a site that goes over the various tests required to make this diagnosis.This is very important, you want to confirm it if autoimmune hep is there or not based on all the correct tests.I wonder why you do not have the genotype? If he did the test for the viral load, usually that same test will show her genotype.",

    "question": "Hep C confirmed for my fiancee.\u00a0\u00a0Viral load still 1500000 ISH. Doc worried about auto immune hepatitis too.\u00a0\u00a0He said probable. Someone here said that that's a problem. He agreed. Also fatty liver possible because of her not under control diabetes. He does NOT want to do a biopsy due to her other probs at this time. Not comfortable with that. Next thing is a genotype.\u00a0\u00a0Opinions? Also gave her new med for itching. Hydroxyzine. Also good for anxiety, depression. I haven't tested yet. Too much work. But i will! also he says her pain may be from the gall bladder. All opinions appreciated. I said i'd be back. Lol.",
