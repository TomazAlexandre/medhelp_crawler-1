    "question": "Hello,I do not know if you can help me out.Last January I got a flu (stomach ache, fever, hot and chills).It was a virus we all got in the family and it was agressive.About one week after that I woke up one morning with great pain in my calves and achilles tendons.It subsided during the day.Since then I've had a feeling as if my feet where in cement blocks.No swelling or anything apparent, just afeeling of tightness in the ankles and along the boneup to the knees.\u00a0\u00a0On both sides.Then I started having lots of fasiculations (like pop-corn feeling or soda pop bubbles) onboth of my lower legs.Then I started having those small fasciculations all over.Then, about a week ago I started having buzzing-flashing sensations on top of my right fingernext to my thumb, for three days.Then I have been having this buzzing in my right foot from time to time.Electrical like shocks at the bottom of my feet.But mostly fasciculations, that go away during the night.In the morning I wake up with my legs feeling stiff.The stiffness goes away as the day moves along and the fascics set in.My blood work was all ok (no diabetes, etc).I got an MRI of the brain and spine, all ok except for a very mild stenosis at C5,but not compressing the cord.My neurological tests (babinsky, etc) were all normal.Blood pressure is ok and I am not under medication.Except that I am very tired.I've also had tingling (pins and needles) a few times in the hands and feet.Could this be the result of the virus??ThanksJohn (34yo)",
