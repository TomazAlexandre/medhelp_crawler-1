            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. Your feet vibration symptoms could be related to nerve compression, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, Vitamin B complex deficiency, neurological disorder or if you are any vibration jobs (like drilling etc). Nerve studies and nerve test may be helpful to further evaluate the condition. I would recommend evaluating the possibilities here with the help of a doctor. Further referral to a neurologist or endocrinologist may be required to assess the condition. Hope this information proves helpful to you. Take Care & Regards!!!",

            "answer": "Thank you, for your answer... I don't have any of the disorders that you mentioned above. I've already been checked for Diabetes, Thyroid Dysfunction and neurological disorders... all negative....However, the nerve compression could be a possibility or the Vitamin B deficiency. I am leaning more toward, one thing that you mentioned...the vibration job...I don't have a job that requires any vibration, but I have noted that in my research to find out what is going on, it's mostly women that have this problem... This may be a little personal, but most health questions are, I guess...however, I think it must be asked... \"Can a sexual vibrating device,\" which is used often enough cause this sensation in the feet/foot? The vibration in the foot does come and go.. It may be there for a few days..then it will be gone for months.. then come back.. Thanks for your help and views.",
