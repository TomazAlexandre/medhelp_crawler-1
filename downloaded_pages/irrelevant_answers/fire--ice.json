            "answer": "Hi!The feeling of ice water/pins-needles running down your leg can be due to spinal nerve compression. It can also be due to peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes, thyroid disorders, Lyme\u2019s and lupus.Whole body pain coming on and off can be due to multiple spinal nerve involvement due to ankylosing spondylitis or osteoarthritis. It can also be fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue disorder, electrolyte imbalalnce or peripheral neuropathies as mentioned above. So yes, they can be connected. Please discuss with your specialist. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

    "question": "For several years I have had stabs of pain that flare. They happen everywhere on my body and while they are brief, (about 1 second), they are also intensely painful. I never know when it will happen as I get them when I'm active or resting. Then about two days ago I started feeling like I had ice water running down my left leg. This sensation is immediately followed by pins & needles throughout my whole leg. It has happened 3-4 times both days. I don't know if the two are connected or not.",
