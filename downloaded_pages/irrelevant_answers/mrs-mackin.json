If you eat fruits eat them with other foods to slow fructose [fruits sugar]. If you eat yogurt read the nutrition label carefully as most have added sugar to sweeten the flavor.Read the post below on 'Breakfast' to get an idea of breakfast foods.Try to avoid white foods as they quickly turn into sugar after eating. For example potatoes, white rice, foods made with white flour - crackers, white breads, cakes, muffins.Use Google search to understand the difference between simple and complex carbohydrates. Simple is bad, complex carbs are better as simple carbs to diabetics is the same as consuming sugar.",
