            "answer": "Hi,How are you?White matter spots in the brain are commonly found in old people, people with a history of long term migraines, high BP, diabetes, MS and may even be an early sign of alzheimer\u2019s disease.Since you have a long history of migraines it is quite possible that these spots are due to that. They occur in roughly 20% patients with migraine. However the other causes also need to be ruled out.MS is not a possibility since you have no other neurological symptoms apart from headache. Please discuss this with your neurologist. Take care!",
