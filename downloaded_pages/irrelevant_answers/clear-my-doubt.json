            "answer": "\"white precipitate in her urine\"Good that you're concerned about your granny's health, but this statement is very vague. Only a doctor can tell her what's wrong with her health, or if she has a clean bill of health. People are reluctant to see a doctor for many reasons, the main reason is they do not want hear if they have a problem. Convince her to go to a doctor for a health checkup. If she hasn't had on this year she's overdue.",

            "answer": "yes. white precipitate in a way that theres white stuff in her urine. she has gone to the doctor and i was not there. Being afriad that i would get worried, she just told me she's on medication and will have to go for another check up after a week or so . The medication are Enalapril Meleate, Simvastain and Ticlopidine hcl. I would like to know patients with these medications are most likely to have what kind of illnesses. She told me that the doctor said it was her kidney that was not clean or somthing. She didnt tell me fully on what this statement is about.",

            "answer": "So far, I have not seen any diabetes related concerns in your posts. What I am reading is you're not getting a complete picture from granny. You are not going to get an answer from a health forum or discussion board aside from a bunch of assumptions and speculations. The only way you are going to know is to go with her and speak with the doctor yourself.You're a good kid to care about your granny this way. I wish her the best.",

    "question": "i am a 19 yr old boy and i knew my granny who is about 60 yrs old had diabetes.recently, she told me she had white precipitate in her urine and told me not to worry. As of being her grandson, i'm naturally rather worried about it. Here i am, in this forum would like to ask anyone if they know the cause of it and what illness can it lead to. I believe it has got somthing to do with either the liver or the kidney as she mention it vividly to me. please, answer to my doubt and i have sleepless nights going on and on ever since i knew about this. Thanks.",
