            "answer": "I responded in the other post but I wanted to clarify here as well: You may not feel very good if the drink drives your blood sugar up high, but a single high blood sugar is not in and of itself dangerous. It is the prolonged blood sugars that cause harm. Also, while this test is useful to see how you respond to carbs, it is important to get an A1C to diagnose diabetes.",

            "answer": "Two things: First of all, don't worry about the numbers not being exactly the same. You remind me of myself when I was first diagnosed. You expect everything to make sense and be consistent. The first rule of diabetes is that nothing is consistent! You can eat the same exact thing one day and have one result and the next day have a completely different result. So don't get hung up on matching up numbers.Okay, now the second and way more important thing: Your numbers are NOT normal. Here is why the doctor says they are: There is a chart they follow to diagnosis pre-diabetes and diabetes. For the OGTT test, all the diagnosis criteria are based on the two hour number. From 140-199 is considered pre-diabetes. Over 200 is considered diabetes. So with your two hour number of 135 your doctor is calling your normal. However, most non-diabetics rarely spike above 125 and this high is hit\u00a0\u00a0in in the first 45 minutes after ingesting carbs before their \"first phase insulin\" response kicks in. You were 179 at the 1/2 hr mark and 218 at one hour. That is not normal and it is not good to sustain highs like that. I would ask for a referral to an endo not to another pcp and have an A1C test done. Meanwhile, don't drive yourself nuts, but keep logging your post prandials (2 hours after meals). Your meter also stores these in memory. You can even do an A1C test at home if you want to have some more information. You can buy an A1C kit at the drugstore for $25-30.No I never had an OGTT. I was 325 fasting on diagnosis so there was no need. But I am a type 1 (LADA) which is a different story.",

            "answer": "The system stinks, you should be able to see an endo if you want to. Sorry, I don't have any suggestions other than find a doctor who will listen to you and either check further himself or refer you to an endo. You can also try doing the home A1C test and if it is pre-diabetes or diabetes use that to convince them.LADA is a slow onset form of type 1 that adults are diagnosed with. Don't worry about it, you have enough on your plate..lol. And do stop worrying about the 1/2 hour result. Like I said, results can vary from day to day. I doubt they did anything wrong. They are just adhering to rigid guidelines for diagnosis. But the A1C is the current standard for diagnosis, not the OGTT.",
