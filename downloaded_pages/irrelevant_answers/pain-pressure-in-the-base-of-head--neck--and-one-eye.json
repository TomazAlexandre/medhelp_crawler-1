            "answer": "No I don't have diabetes, but I have a strong family history of it. I have a fast heartbeat (inappropriate sinus tachycardia) and am on atenolol which is used to treat hypertension; however I've been on it for over a year, and just started experiencing these symptoms about 3 months ago.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are two main possibilities. One is \u2018benign intracranial hypertension\u2019(BIH). This happens due to impaired CSF absorption. A generalized throbbing headache worst felt in the morning and last thing at night. This headache is generally relieved on standing (consistent with raised intracranial pressure). It is aggravated by straining, coughing or a change in position. This headache is accompanied by various neurological symptoms such as dizziness, numbness, loss of vision, loss of hearing etc, all of which are temporary.You need a prompt evaluation by a neurologist. Hypothyroidism, hypoparathyroidism, adrenal insufficiency are a few things I would recommend you get investigated for. These can precipitate BIH. A spinal tap is a must both to diagnose the condition and to treat it.The other possibility is cervical nerve compression high up in cervical spine. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. A MRI of the cervical spine and nerve conduction studies may be required. Please consult a neurologist. The treatment is to remove the compression. You have to discuss the best treatment option with a neurologist, which can range from medication to physiotherapy to traction, cervical collars or even surgery.It can be high BP too but less likely. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to a neurologist.Take care!",

    "question": "For the past few months I've been experiencing a lot of pressure and a throbbing, pulsing feeling in the back of my head (at the base), my neck, and the same pressure and pulsing feeling in my eyes, but its usually one eye at a time. Laying down usually makes it worse, unless I lay in just the right way which is new every time. I've read a lot online and everything says its pressure, stress, anxiety, or tension, but I honestly don't think its either. I've put hot rags and other things to relax my muscles, but that never seems to make a different. It never happens at a stressful time in my life either. Last time it happened was on vacation! My neck also starts to feel wobbly, like my head is too heavy or something.I'm really starting to worry, its almost as if there is excess fluid in the back of my head or something, if that makes any sense. But every time it happens, one of my eyes is also affected. It gets to where all I can do is close my eyes to make the pain somewhat go away.Does anyone know what this could be? Every part of me is telling me its NOT a tension/anxiety thing. Part of me thinks its more sinus related than stress related.. But I haven't had any sinus problems lately and I'm still feeling it. Anyone know what I'm describing?Oh and just some background info: I have been diagnosed with inappropriate sinus tachycardia and I'm on atenolol for it. I've had my thyroid checked and all my levels were okay.",
