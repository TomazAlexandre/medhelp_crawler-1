            "answer": "I noticed that you mentioned rheumatoid arthritis on your profile.\u00a0\u00a0If you have rheumatoid arthritis that would account for the high sedimentation rate since it's a test that measures inflammation.Your iron is high and the hemoglobin is on the high side of normal.\u00a0\u00a0It would be significant because females that have rheumatoid arthritis tend to be anemic.\u00a0\u00a0Having too much iron can work against the treatment for Hep C.By the way, were you fasting when you had this blood test done? Because if you were fasting then you're prediabetic.\u00a0\u00a0A blood sugar above 5 means pre-diabetes which can also work against treatment.\u00a0\u00a0If you're planning to treat again you should look into that before you start.Best of luck to you,Co",

            "answer": "what do you suggest for lovering iron, and also for blood sugar? some medications, or just natural with food> No, I was not fasting before giving blood test. Thank for the answer that you gave me. I intend to retreat, and I would offcourse have to regulate the iron. I heard about flobotomy (taking out the blood, in order to lower iron level) that should be offcourse recommended by the hematologist.",
