            "answer": "Hi!Since you are on blood pressure medications, one possibility is that you develop very low blood glucose levels. Since the dizziness comes while driving and while prolonged standing, it can also be due to some problems with the balance organs of the ear. Postural hypotension is another possibility where blood pressure drops on prolonged standing or changing position from sitting to standing etc. A tilt table test, holter monitor, echocardiogram, ECHO, stress test\u00a0\u00a0etc are done for confirmed diagnosis. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
