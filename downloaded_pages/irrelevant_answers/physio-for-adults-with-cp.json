            "answer": "Hi.I understand what you are going through.I think you need to insist on your rehabilitation medicine doctor that you want a more frequent physiotherapy.\u00a0\u00a0However, there may be a reason why it was offered every 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0You should go back to your doctor and discuss this.\u00a0\u00a0Other option would be to hire a private physiotherapist.Good luck and God bless you always.",

            "answer": "Dr. Dennis gave you great advice.\u00a0\u00a0Work with a physiatrist and hang it there!My father has mild spastic diplegia (other doctors say paraparesis), but the common denominator that all agree on is for him to walk and do as much for himself as possible.Because his family thought there nothing wrong with him, he never saw a neurologist or physiatrist until he was in his 40s.\u00a0\u00a0By then other health problems, like osteoarthritis, cropped up, making movement more difficult.\u00a0\u00a0Now that he's retired, depression, osteoporosis, and diabetes have come into play.Rehab doctors understand the whole body approach and often have the drive and patience that other doctors may not have.\u00a0\u00a0Insurance plays a big role on physical therapy, so that might limit how often you get therapy.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you get a therapist who will work with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Most of them balked at my dad's doctor's orders and didn't want to do aggressive stretching out of fear of breaking bones (while tearing soft tissue would probably happen before that).\u00a0\u00a0But an experienced therapist, who focuses on neurological conditions, can make all the difference in the world.Good luck....j c",

    "question": "I would like to get a little more mobile. I have just Had ANOTHER Hernia op and keep getting these due to the stress that my 'trunk' puts on my stomach when tranfering from wheelchair to bed or turning over in bed. I am trying to apply for an electric bed to try and ease the pressure.I had physio\u00a0\u00a0everyday as a child and when I got to 16 and left school in all stopped. The only physio I've been offrered since then is 6 weeks at a time and thats it.They leave me with excersises to do but this doesnt do that much, I want to be stretched and with a physio because this is what works for me.Does anyone else out there get the correct physio they need as an adult without having to go private???",
