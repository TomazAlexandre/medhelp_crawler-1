            "answer": "Are you feeling any better?From your post, I am guessing that your blood sugars are normally under control just high this week since you started having dizziness and vomiting?Your blood sugars are probably not causing the dizziness and vomiting - more likely to cause thirst and hunger. The dizziness and vomiting are probably causing the high blood sugars. When your body is under stress, it becomes insulin resistant and your blood sugars rise. Plus, dehydration causes your blood sugars to rise. You need to contact your healthcare provider and tell him or her what has been happening and be sure to emphasize this has been going on for a week.(As for the dizziness on awakening, any reason to think your blood pressure is low?\u00a0\u00a0Are you on medication for blood pressure?\u00a0\u00a0Before trying to get up, pump your feet. Plus, tighten your knees, and the muscles of your legs, buttocks, and abdomen then release. Do this a few times to pump your blood back up to your heart. Or, do you just wake up and find you are dizzy?\u00a0\u00a0 This could be an ear infection... just hard to guess.)Hope you are feeling better.",
