            "answer": "Armpits are notorious for bacterial growth of all types of organisms.Without much hypothesis the chances of bacterial or fungal growth during immobility during a cellutitis on that side can not be overemphasised.Without fear of all the rest,go in for an antibacterial soap,and candid powder.Soon you would stop worrying.",

    "question": "I have suspected Behcet's Disease or something like it, and have recurrent inflammations of the veins, skin, eyes, pancreas and bowels etc etc over the past 10 yrs. I also have Diabetes Inspidus and am often incontinent and sweaty, but with dry mouth nose and eyes and a terrible thirst. I am female, aged 44, and not yet menopausal.I currently am recovering from a cellulitis infection in my right arm which has been there for about 5 weeks, it peaked at about 3 weeks ago. Just as it is getting better, the sweats and fever I normally suffer whilst having this are not . I noticed too, that my dogs both seem obssessed with sniffing up and down my right arm and keep trying to shove their noses in my armpit.A couple of days ago, I smelt a horrible waft of body odour, a bit like a man's type of BO, and then discovered it is coming from my right armpit and despite washing, drying, and showering over and over daily and using a male anit-perspirant I cannot get rid of it. Despite sweating all over, and in my left armpit as well, there is no BO elsewhere...only on one small patch of skin in my right armpit.Is this related to having cellulitis in that arm, or is the BO a co-incicidence? Is it here to stay?It is causing me some embarrassment.I have one other fear as well. I come from a family that carries the genes for breast cancer, and am worried that my armpit might be something to do with a blockage, and perhaps is a symptom of something not right on that side. My grandmother died at 42 from breast cancer, after having a lump develop in her armpit.I am guessing that the bacteria in the cellulitis might have collected in the lymph node, and could be excreted in my sweat on that side. Normally my fresh sweat is non oily and smells of nothing but water, but not in the right armpit, it is sticky there and very smelly as soon as it comes out.",
