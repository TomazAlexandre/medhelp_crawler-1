            "answer": "I was diagnosed at 40 as a type 1 diabetic and was likewise shocked.\u00a0\u00a0I would be happy to answer any questions that I can.\u00a0\u00a0I know that it can be very confusing at first.First thing to know is the difference between type 1 and 2.In type 1 the pancreas fails and no Insulin is produced.\u00a0\u00a0This does tend to happen at an early age but can happen at any age.\u00a0\u00a0Also Type 2 takes years to develope so it usually happens to adults.\u00a0\u00a0Thus the referral to Juvenile which I think is misleading.In Type 2 the pancreas is working BUT your body is not using the Insulin that it is producing as efficiently as it should.\u00a0\u00a0This gets compounded as time goes on and as you get older the body can no longer keep up so to speak.\u00a0\u00a0In this case you create ways of making your body use that insulin more effectively.\u00a0\u00a0This can be done by watching your diet and exercising and in some cases using drugs.In Type 1 you do not produce ANY insulin to be used more effectively so you HAVE to take Insulin because your body does not produce any.That is a general overview.\u00a0\u00a0I would be happy to answer any more questions that I can.\u00a0\u00a0Please post more ....",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your response and answers to my question. My son is learning to deal with insulin.\u00a0\u00a0They are learning to read the labels on foods, portion sizes, counting carbs, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I am proud of him, as he is taking this serious.\u00a0\u00a0I told his wife that she needed to make him responsible for taking his insulin, because he has a tendency to want to be taken care of. She said he already stated he wanted her to give him his shots.\u00a0\u00a0I nipped that in the bud for her (I hope) and told him HE has to do it, not her.\u00a0\u00a0I know she will do well with the diet part for him, but I also know that she has her hands full with two toddlers and a newborn - she doesn't have time to deal with the insulin portion of his diabetes.Here is my question.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any really good cook books or Menus for them to get?\u00a0\u00a0I know they are working with a dietician and have received booklets with some menus, but she is looking for a more variety of foods she can cook for them.I am glad you explained the difference between type 1 and 2.\u00a0\u00a0It totally makes sense to me.Thank you again.\u00a0\u00a0If you think of anything that will help, let me know.",
