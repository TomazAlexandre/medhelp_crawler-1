            "answer": "Thank you for taking the time to read this and getting to know about me. My name is Eric, im a 35 year old divorced father of two. My son, Kyle is 14. My daughter, Hailey Dawn is 12 and my gifriends son, Gage is 12. Of course Gage is my son aswell.Im currently unemployed for various reason you will learn if you read ALL this, lol. But the ONLY thing keep in me from driving (local truck driver) is my blood sugar lvls. Cant pass the DOT psyical.Im very new to this and it really scares me. Lost my grandpop to diabetes a little while ago. I would of never guessed id hsve it now. But that and heart disease and everything else runs in my family. Im adpoted so don't really know the whole gest of my bio family health. I have chest pains alot, and even pain down left arm, neck hurts all at Same time. Stress they say. Which I am under a HUGE ammount of stress. Ive had a heart cathitor and it came back clean. Had ecg, eks, the works and so far no heart attack or no sign. I do get alot of heart palptations a day, but have had those for last 10 years. I also have Reflux issues, or GERD. As long as I take two prilosec a day in good. And then my back. I jacked up my back a few years ago moving a sofa. The MRI said it was a corroded disc? Something like that. Said id prolly need Surgery and shots in back to control pain.I cant stand or walk longer then 10 to 20 minutes without my legs going compleatly numb and burning like they are in fire. My under legs and thighs have been should going numb for years. Both legs. Im a mess. I was born and raised on a big farm in Iowa. My father, whom I love very much, but we have not said it to eachother since the day I left for boot camp in 99, Is the hardest working man ive ever known. And im not bein bias. He was in a tractor rollover when I was just a baby, and broke his back. Told him he wouldnt walk again. Put two Rods down the length of his spine. He defied the odds, and gained fully mobility of his legs.Fwd 40 years, both Rods have been broke for years\u00a0\u00a0every time he takes a step in alot of pain, been that way for years. And yet he still runs a 3000 acre farm, with 150 head if cattle. With just two hired hands. And me of course growing up. He never went to the doctor. Never. From hours upon hours of riding in a combine day after day, year after year, or grinding feel or mowing, raking and baleing hay. To throwing hay, hauling grain. My Dad did it all, and still does to this day. With broken Rods in his back. He did FINALLY get Surgery a few years back. So I guess when I got hurt or didnt feel good, i just rubbed some dirt on it like my Dad did. And that cost me dearly, as yall can see. Now I make sure my children KNOW of anything hurts or doesnt seem right, GO TO THE DOCTOR.Thanks again for taking time out of your day to learn about me. God Bless",
