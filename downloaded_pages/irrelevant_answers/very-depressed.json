            "answer": "I'm sorry you're having a hard time. Depression is not uncommon with diabetes. Could the rise in your A1C be connected to your depression? The short answer is yes, not directly, but indirectly because it's hard enough to manage diabetes when you feel well, but when you're depressed everything is more of a struggle. My opinion is first of all, don't beat up on yourself! Depression is an illness the same as diabetes and needs treatment. If the Paxil was no longer working, then your doctor should try you on a different medication. My suggestion (I worked in the field for many years) would be to see a Psychiatrist rather than just your medical doctor because they are a lot more experienced at working with people to get them on the right dose of the right medication. I also would strongly suggest getting into some type of therapy. Medication for depression is only one side of the picture, dealing with the issues involved is the other.And I want to say one more time: Don't beat up on yourself! (this tendency to be self-critical is part of the depression as well!)",

            "answer": "Good, I'm glad to hear you're doing better! I've heard a lot worse A1C's than 7.5! My guess is now that you're feeling better emotionally you should be able to get your numbers back down. The good thing about diabetes is each day is a new opportunity to have good numbers!",
