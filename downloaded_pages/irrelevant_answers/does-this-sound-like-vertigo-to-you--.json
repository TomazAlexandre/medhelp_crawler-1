            "answer": "Hi there.Dizziness and weakness can come from various causes.\u00a0\u00a0Low hemoglobin levels (red blood cells) can cause this as well as low or high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Metabolic abnormalities such as high blood sugar levels (diabetes) or thyroid problems (hyper or hypothyroid states) can also offer some explanation. Diabetes can also initially present as orthostatic hypotension (lowering of blood pressure upon abrupt standing) that can cause dizziness or blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0Local eye problems such as errors of refraction or astigmatism can cause these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The negative scans all sound reassuring.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you discuss these other options with your doctors.\u00a0\u00a0For now, have adequate rest and a good diet.\u00a0\u00a0Regards.",
