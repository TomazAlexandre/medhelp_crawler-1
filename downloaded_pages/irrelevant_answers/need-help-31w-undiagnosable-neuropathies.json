    "question": "Im a 31 yr old male, self-employed gym owner and fitness enthusiast, diagnosed w/U.C. 2 yrs. ago. Daily I take Pentasa 4g/day, 50mg of 6mp plus folate. Four mos. ago probs started. Mild muscle soreness in forearms, then traveled to hands, legs & feet. No severe cramping. My arms would tingle and go numb from the shoulder to my fingers. My legs and feet would ache and also get a numb/COLD feeling and tingling sensation. It would be intermittent and switch from side-to-side and limb-to-limb with no obvious pattern. I have been to 4 primary physicians, 3 neurologists, a pain&rehab specialist, a Sports Doc, my eye dr., dentist and gastro & I have had the following tests conducted (sometimes more than 1x) Chemistry, glucose, Liver and Kidney functions, Magnesium, Lipid Panel, Thyroid Function, CPK, PSA, Testost, Hematology, CBC w/diff., CRP, homocysteine, free t3, sodium, potassium, bun, creatine & entire panel, Cholesterol, all Hepatitis, CBC w/diff./platelet, Rheumatoid Arthritis Factor Ra Latex Turbid, ANA Direct, Uric acid, AST/ALT/ Sed Rate West, Lyme Disease, Hemoglobin Alc, Acetylchol Recap Bind Ab w/Rfx, AChR Modulating Ab, GGT, Zinc, Plasma or serum, EBV acute infect, Iron & tibc, Comp. Metabol. Panel, Glom Filtrate Rate, Hepatic Fxn Panel, Lipid Panel, HSV 1 & 2-Spec. Ab, IgG and HSV II IgG, RPR, Vitamin b12, Serum, an EMG of upper extremities, a test for myelitis, an MRI brain & MRI cerv. Spine, spine X-ray, stress test Of all this the only thing found was mild bilateral carpal tunnel & ulnar neuritis and a slightly elevate CPK (250) since I train w/weights & do cardio every day. I still feel tingling, cramping, numbness, pain, coldness (neuropathies) sporadically in all of my extremities. My hands feel stiff & achy/\u201cslow\u201d. I have normal BP. Is it possible that we are missing something? Its not a vitamin deficiency, nor diabetes, not lupus, not MS. Could it be directly related to my IBD? I am so confused. It is all I think about anymore. Please Help!",
