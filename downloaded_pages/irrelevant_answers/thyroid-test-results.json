            "answer": "First, your rheumy ordered some really obsolete thyroid tests.\u00a0\u00a0He ordered total T3 and total T4, which don't yield as much useful information as FT3 and FT4.That being said, your TT4 is above range, consderably higher than the midrange recommended as a target for T4.\u00a0\u00a0At the same time, your TT3 is quite low in the range.\u00a0\u00a0When T4 is higher in its range than T3 is in its, a comversion issue is often indicated.Your TGab is positive at 7 with a range of 0-4.\u00a0\u00a0TGab is a marker for Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0However, that's a pretty \"weak\" positive, and TGab can be elevated with other autoimmune conditions.\u00a0\u00a0TPOab is negative.\u00a0\u00a0I'd assume it's your RA raising your TGab level.How much Synthroid do you take, and for how long have you been taking it?How do you feel?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have either hypo or hyper symptoms?I think you should see another doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Your rheumy doesn't seem to have a grasp on which tests to order.\u00a0\u00a0An endo isn't necessarily the answer and some endos tend to specialize in diabetes and are not good thyroid doctors.",

            "answer": "Endocrinology is the specialty that deals with thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0However, as I said, not all endos are good thyroud doctors.\u00a0\u00a0If possible, you might want to call the doctor's office before making an appointment and ask some questions (probably through a nurse).One good question to ask is which tests the doctor typically orders for his hypo patients.\u00a0\u00a0You want to hear FT3, FT4 and TSH.\u00a0\u00a0Given your current labs, I think it's very important for them to test FT3 now.You can also ask which thyroid meds they are willing to prescribe.\u00a0\u00a0It looks like you might need to add some T3 to your current levo (and reduce it a bit).\u00a0\u00a0Some doctor's won't prescribe T3, so you want to stay away from them.Do you feel either hyper or hypo?",

    "question": "I have RA and hypothyroidism. My rheumatologist ordered these tests. I am also on Synthroid. TSH = 3.2 (0.5-4.7 UIU/ML);T3 = 102 (60-181 NG/DL); T4 = 14.1 (4.4-12.4 UG/DL);Thyroglobulin AB = 7 (<4 IU/ML); Thyroid microsomal (peroxidase) AB = 1 (<9 IU/ML). Can you please tell me what these tests might indicate? Should I see an endocrinologist?",
