    "question": "My husband has been taking ativan for stress for close to 3 years now.\u00a0\u00a0At first it really helped. And he was able to sleep at night, too.\u00a0\u00a0After all this time, he has become immune to it.\u00a0\u00a0Our lives have been a nightmare over these 3 years and we don't see any light at the end of this tunnel yet. Things just seem to be getting worse, everything from severe medical issues for the both of us, unemployment and finances, 3 months behind on rent, no jobs out there, his mom in the hospital for that past month, etc, etc, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I'm disabled and receive social security and he has no income at all.\u00a0\u00a0He seldom even gets out of bed anymore. I can hear him in there now just moaning about life.\u00a0\u00a0He has diabetes now, too, and his sugar levels are always between the low 200's and low 300's (100 is what a diabetic should be)So, my question is, if the doctor would change him over to diazepam, or something along those lines, would it give him the relief he use to have before he became immune to the ativan?I've done a little research on the different anxiety medications and from what I see, diazepam seems to be a good medication that would help.\u00a0\u00a0But, would it work?\u00a0\u00a0He's already on prozac and has been on several different antidepressants, it's the anxiety that he needs help with. The antidepressants he's been on don't help at all.So, would it help to change from the ativan and is there a medication out there that would help him like the ativan use to?",
