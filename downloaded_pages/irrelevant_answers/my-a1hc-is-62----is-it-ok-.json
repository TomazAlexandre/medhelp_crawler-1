            "answer": "An A1c of 6.2% is considered high. Some doctors may say this is OK while others who understand the eAG [estimated Average Glucose] formula know it is unhealthy to remain at this level. To understand the eAG in relation to an A1c result use this manual formula: [calculators can be located online]28.7 X A1C \u2013 46.7 = eAG in mg/dlor1.583 X A1c - 2.52 = eAG in mmol/lIn your case abhimanyu64, your 6.2% A1c is equivalent to having a daily average glucose level of 131.24 mg/dl.28.7 X 6.2 - 46.7 = 131.24 mg/dlAs you know anything above 126 mg/dl is considered diabetes. Without knowing your previous A1c result I cannot say if diet and exercise alone is helping to reduce your daily glucose levels. However, do not stop as diet and daily physical exercise are vital with helping to control and manage your glucose levels. You may have to look closer at your diet plan and continue to eliminate certain food types [carbs].",

            "answer": "Yes, that's what diabetes does. How soon or what 'part' or what side effect affects each person differently at different stages/times in their life. The only thing you should be concerned about is to try to obtain normal and/or near normal levels. Some can and some cannot, you just have to try your best at all times.",
