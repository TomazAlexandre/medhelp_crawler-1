            "answer": "Hi Mare, I am also diabetic (7 years, the last 2 insulin dependent).\u00a0\u00a0I was treated with Glipizide, glyburide, lasix, glucophage, several others.\u00a0\u00a0They all have warnings against alcohol.I disagree with Pointman, however, about having your husband stop alcohol completely.One glass of beer or wine is not excessive.\u00a0\u00a0I do agree that what is most important is your husbands blood sugar level, that he manages his numbers.\u00a0\u00a0If his blood sugar is always high, he might eat differently to still take advantage of that one or two glasses of beer or wine.\u00a0\u00a0Or he might slow down on the alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone's body is different, but I've found, what works for me at least, is a balance.\u00a0\u00a0If I'm going out socially, and might be inclined to \"have a few\" I make sure I watch my numbers, watch the food I'm eating, and make sure I walk around a bit (my form of excercise).It's good you care about your husband's condition enough to post here.\u00a0\u00a0He's a lucky man.The quality of happiness your husband is experiencing is also a factor in overall health.It's true of you, and everyone.\u00a0\u00a0If having a glass helps him stay calm & happy, I think the benefit outweighs the struggle of \"being forced\" to stop.Good luck with your sensability and balance!Morrowville",

I did say he shouuld stop all alchohl.Perhaps\u00a0\u00a0i should\u00a0\u00a0ave added al at once soem times\u00a0\u00a0thsi isnt the best way.But drinking is no good ask almost any DR. reead how much sugar is n thoe beverages.among other things not so good, if he coininues to drind\u00a0\u00a0he will most likely wind up takinuing more meds,, and then probley wind\u00a0\u00a0up on insluin.gar level goes up. it wil eventualy harm my body more if i would have conimued to do so. yes i like sweets like alot of other people , but\u00a0\u00a0iahve to avoid them I am only making sugestions.Marrowville disgreed with me and he told yuo all the meds he wa son and now he is on insluin, perhaps that is why he is becuse eh chose to have is beverages. i dont mean to be didrespecrful to marrovile .But best thing ask his DR.",
