    "question": "This morning I woke up and felt really off balance. I had a bagel and 2 bottles of water. I went to work and felt like I was going to faint. I am now at home resting but still feel very dizzy. Is this normal or has it ever happened to you? I can feel my little man moving but it just makes me nervous. Thanks for your help.",
