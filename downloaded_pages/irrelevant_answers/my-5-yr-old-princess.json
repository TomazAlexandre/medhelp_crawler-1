    "question": "My 5 yr. old daughter has had a cold for a few days now. I had started her on the tylenol cold medicine. I noticed in the last 2 days that she has been urinating very frequently. My husband and I brought her to an 1 1/2 hour long movie this morning and she had to urinate 5 times within that time period. She voided very minimal amounts to almost just a few drops of urine. This evening, we brought her to have diner at a restaurant and she had gone twice in an hour. The concerning part this evening was how she sat on the toilet for about 20 minutes with very little to no results. She was bearing down just to void and was very sure wasn't needing to move her bowels. She had been looking tired, and like something's bothering her. I had been noticing she had complained about belly pains more often for about 2 to 3 weeks now. I'm concerned about diabetes or kidney problems. Or is frequent urination just a side effect of the tylenol cold medicine? She has quite a sweet tooth. and noticed appetite is not as it used to be. She's fairly skinny but tall. I don't have diabetes nor my husband. My grandmother on my dad's side has a brother that was a diabetic and my dad's sister has diabetes which I'm not sure if it was hereditary or acquired due to her weight and bad eating habits. My husband doesn't know of any immediate relative that has diabetes. Kindly help me with this dilemma. I'm very concerned with my child's health and welfare. Thank you in advance for your kind help.",
