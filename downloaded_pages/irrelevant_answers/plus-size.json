I am also plus size, and gained 100 lbs with my firat. Only 35-40 so far with this one. Dr said she was proud I didn't gain as much, but I needed to make sure I stared exercises once I can start them due to stress on heart.",

He made me feel like my weight wasn't an issue. He encouraged me to gain a healthy amount of weight and told me when I was losing weight that it wasn't a concern until I was in my 3rd trimester.\u00a0\u00a0I was so sad when we moved states and I am now pregnant again and had to get a new OB who seems very nice too.",

            "answer": "Your doctor will be looking at it purely from a medical perspective, not a personal one. You'll feel so much better if you can lose a bit... Even just briskly walking for an hour every day will help. You'll have more energy and your back pain will subside, labour will be easier and risk of complications for eg. gestationsl diabetes is lower.Good luck and congratulations!",
