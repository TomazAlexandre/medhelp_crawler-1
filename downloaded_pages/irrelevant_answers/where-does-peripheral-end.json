            "answer": "Not sure about an isolated 3x3 patch, but we have had patients with diabetes who have numbness on their trunk that by EMG are found to have a peripheral neuropathy affecting the thoracic nerve roots.\u00a0\u00a0Spinal cord problems from compression or MS can also cause sensory loss on the trunk.\u00a0\u00a0But again, I don't know\u00a0\u00a0if this is the case with your patch of numbness without examining you personally and reviewing your clinical history.\u00a0\u00a0Whether or not it oomes back depends on what the cause is, how long it's been there, etc...As for the muscle twitching, I have heard some patients with MS complain of muscle twitches, but I'm not sure if that's caused by or clearly associated with the MS.\u00a0\u00a0Normal people can get them all the time and patients with irritation to the nerve roots (radiculopathy) as well as severe peripheral neuropathies have had them, too. Benign fasciculation syndrome is also a consideration. Hope that helps.",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with PN 3 months ago. Of course I was in pain for 2 months before that. I went from Doctor to Doctor before I was diagnosed. The pain started in my groins. I have sufferedsevere benign fasiculations in my calves for years, but the fasiculations spread all over my body. The pain then moved into my legs, feet, hands, biceps, chest and flanks. I have had several nerve blocks done, but they only lasted about a week.Most of the pain is moderate, but the pain in my flanks, chest and groin get very severe. The Neurologist that diagnosed me spent about 15 minutes with me. I have tried to get to see her again, but still have to wait another month. I have seen several other Doctors and had many blood test. I was told that PN can affect any nerves. All my problems came soon after I had elbow surgery, but no one can connect that to my PN. It has ruined my life. I am on several meds, but still try and work, so I limit what I take. My biggest problem now is ear pain and ringing ears.Two ENT's can't find anything, so I guess that's PN too.",

    "question": "I've read lots about peripheral neuropathy being on extremities, but is it still peripheral if it is on the trunk, just to one side of the spinal cord?\u00a0\u00a0I would have thought the numbness would follow the nerve around to the side and front, but the skin is numb only in about a 3-by-3-inch patch just to the side of my backbone.\u00a0\u00a0Does that mean it is just the nerve root?\u00a0\u00a0What is the likelyhood of this being from MS, diabetes, or compression, or anything else?\u00a0\u00a0I guess neuropathy can also mean a painful sensation--personally I'd rather have numbness, but can the numbness mean that the nerve is dead, and the feeling won't come back at all?\u00a0\u00a0(It has been a couple of months now, as near as I can figure.)Also, while I have your ear, are widespread muscle twitches ever part of MS?\u00a0\u00a0They've lasted over a year now, along with some buzzing and weakness of left leg.Thanks in advance,Karen",
