            "answer": "I'm not a doctor and therefore not qualified to diagnose.\u00a0\u00a0However, I have heard from several people who have hypoglycemia that it doesn't necessarily show up in the blood work.\u00a0\u00a0If I were you I would make an appointment with a nutritionist or dietitian and put yourself on a hypoglcemic diet and see what you feel like. It's absically a healthy diet high in proteins and complex carbs and low in simple sugars.\u00a0\u00a0That may resolve your problem. I am not familiar with hyperinsulinism.\u00a0\u00a0The only other suggestion I have is to get a second opinion from an endocrinologist to see if you can get a more definitive diagnosis.Having your blood sugar go low can be very scary.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you can get this resolved soon.ES",

            "answer": "Hi Tricia1,I'm not a physician.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a long time diabetic who reads a lot about this disease.Unfortunately, I don't know enough about hyperinsulism as a \"chronic\" condition to begin to answer your question. I know it is a devastating condition in infants & young children.\u00a0\u00a0In general, hyperinsulinism can also be transient when we have -- for a short interval -- too much insulin in our bloodstreams.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes that can be a precursor to Type 2 diabetes (are you overweight?).I would recommend that you keep very good records for a while -- was you eat when, how you are feeling, what your blood sugar is at those times, exercise & general health patterns.\u00a0\u00a0WRite those things down in an easy to read/refer to format and bring them to your doc.\u00a0\u00a0If your current doc has run out of ideas or \"dismisses\" your concerns, it may be time to find another doc with whom you can work effectively.Hope this is of some help.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you.",

    "question": "I have a real problem with low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0At certain times in the day I shake and feel as if I could pass out.\u00a0\u00a0Also, there are times when my body has completely ceased up, but I'm all there mentally.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor has done a three day 16 hour fast and said that hypoglycemia will definately show up if I have it.\u00a0\u00a0I could have told him it won't, as I have had this done before and the readings are perfect, and I feel great after a fast. Because of this they seem to think I don't have a problem, but every time I have been to my own doctor after having had breakfast, my readings are about 2.1.\u00a0\u00a0Just lately, I have been controlling what I eat more and know to eat fruit at the times I know I usually start shaking.\u00a0\u00a0It's just that sometimes, I go straight into a cease rather than get the warning shakes.Could it be that I have hyperinsulinism?Many thanks.Tricia",
