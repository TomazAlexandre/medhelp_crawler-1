            "answer": "I agree with the inner ear suggestion. My father is a type 2 diabetic who is in fairly good control and hardly ever gets sick with anything. Recently he started having woozy spells and the vomiting. THey thought it was a stomach bug to begin with, but with more research found it was an inner ear infection. He was treated for that with some antibiotics and he is now fine. The ears have a lot to do with your equilibrium and can throw things off if infected (i.e. the dizzyness and vomiting can be caused from the dizzyness and headaches). Worst case scenario, you have to keep having tests run, best case, it is an infection and can be treated quickly.",

I have had an illness where\u00a0\u00a0I see spots in front of my eyes and my ears ring and I have the feeling that my stomach churns and then I usually throw up once or twice. It doesn't happen very often. I do not know what is causing it. After I throw up I feel better. I am on medication for Bipolar depression, Pyschosis and an obsessive compulsive disorder(hair pulling) I have had this illness more than 10 or 20 times but I really do not have a record book on how often it occurs like weekly, monthly, or yearly. Anyone have these symptoms like I get every once in a while?",
