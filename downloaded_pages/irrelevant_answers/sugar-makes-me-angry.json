    "question": "It is 2 years now that every time I eat something sweet (containing sugar/honey) or something with extra salt (like chips), I get angry outbursts. I lose 100% the control of myself. I yell and wanna break things. If I could kill someone, I would do it..I did all the laboratory blood tests that are needed for diabetes and I do not have the desease. My weight is normal for my height too.When I eat every 3 hours and not sugar or extra salt, they call me angel because my nature is very calm (I suffer from depression but I just stay silent)What could be happening to me?",
