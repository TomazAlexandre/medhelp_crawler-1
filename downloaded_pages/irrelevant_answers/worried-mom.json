            "answer": "I have never heard of a child having a lipid problem but... when they take my blood it is orange/yellow in color. I have hyperlipodemia (very high triglycerides) It is a genetic problem in my family, not an over eating of fatty foods problem. The normal is below 200, mine is usually around 1300. My sisters was higher and she ended up with pancreatitis (major stomach pains were her first sigh). It really couldn't hurt to ask his Dr. to do a lipid panel. I wish you the best!",

    "question": "My 6 year old son has alot of stomach pains, he constantly feels the need to urinate sometimes as much as 6 or more times in an hour(although he doesn't always actually urinate). His urine shows no signs of infection. His bloodwork is normal except for a elevated direct bilirubin. His other LFT's are normal , his sugars are normal. I am a laboratory technologist and I had a look at his sample and noticed his serum was orange in color ( there were no signs of hemolysis). His total bilirubin was normal as well. I can't figure this out? HELP!!!!!",
