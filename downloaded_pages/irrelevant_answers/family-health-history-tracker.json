    "question": "A lot of common chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer are known to 'run in the family'. You should include a family health history tracker. There is a new website called ItRunsInMyFamily.com that has a really good family health history tool [http://www.secure.itrunsinmyfamily.com]. This would be a great addition to your list of disease trackers.",
