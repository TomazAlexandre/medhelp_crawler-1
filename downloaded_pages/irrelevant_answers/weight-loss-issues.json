            "answer": "I found some low impact exercises for people with arthritis here a week or so ago but can't find it now of course. Since I am very out of shape and have arthritis that can't handle the jarring impact on my joints, I have started with just doing stretching (very slowly) and have tried to walk more. There is an exercise link on the right to get rid of the belly but I wouldn't be able to get off the floor or sit on the ball. I'm assuming the same is true for you, but some of the stretching exercises are doable.We had a nice weekend and I did take my dog to the park which made walking more enjoyable, but as much as I hate going to shopping malls I think that is what I'll be trying until the weather gets better.My dr. suggested water aerobics/swimming, but a gym is not in my budget. You should ask your dr. for suggestions, but stretching and walking are a good beginning.sdm52",

            "answer": "That is a good start. I also use hamd weights while sitting but soup cans can also be used. Just do some arm exercises with those. Put a ball between your knees while sitting and squeese, relax, squeese etc. Put your palms flat on the wall, step back and lean into the wall, push\u00a0\u00a0back, lean etc.. These are effective sit ups without laying down and sitting up which is so hard on the back if your have pain in the spine.Good luck to you.",
