            "answer": "Hello,One of the possibilities for such kind of toe problems is peripheral vascular disease. The other possibility is of Raynaud\u2019s disease. Raynaud\u2019s disease is a vascular disorder that affects blood flow to the extremities which include the fingers, toes, nose and ears when exposed to temperature changes or stress. This causes blueness and swelling of the skin.I feel that a consultation of a physician will be the best. Other causes of swollen and blue peripheries like diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid also have to be ruled out. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "hello! im having some derm. problems. For a while now, my toes have been turning purple. Sometimes if i wear flip flops in public my feet look almost dead. A year ago i developed a cluster of bumps on my toe. They stayed for months. Turning bruised and discusting. Once they went away, they came back in a different way on my toe. Same type of thing though, bumps that turn purple bruised and stay for a very long time, it also makes my joint swollen.. Ive also been developing joint problems in my elbows, and my hands lock up at night so i am a little alarmed. I attached links to pictures, please let me know if you know what it could behttp://www.flickr.com/photos/47602854@N03/4364584611/i have a appt for a dermatologist soon but what do you think?",
