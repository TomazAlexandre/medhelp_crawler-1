            "answer": "I'm sure the doc will make sure they do the epi so that it's not gonna hurt ur back anymore. It's probably ur sciatic nerve that's causing the pain n numbness dwn ur back. I'm havn that same pain. Doc said a chiropractor would help me a lot I also have 2 bulge discs n my back so I know what it is ur goin thru. Baby weight is good at this point don't worry bout him being to big he's average weight right now. I'm not sure how u handle pain but try not to get epi like the other person said if u can. Otherwise ur n good hands with ur docs trust them...Good luck!!!!",

Talk to the nurses once in the delivery room. Make sure Ur delivery coach (hubby/friend/dula) knows to do the same. I'm sure Ur not the 1st person they've seen w this as an issue/concern. Try to relax. Good luck. Your baby will be in Ur arms soon.",

            "answer": "Women with gestational diabetes do tend to have larger babies but you can't always go by the ultrasound's estimated weight. My dr said they can be more than a pound off in either direction. I was told my son was around 6 pounds, 4 days before he was born. He was nearly 9 pounds. Like a comment above, she was told 9 pounds and baby was 6. My niece was told hers was 9 pounds and she was born at 7 pounds. Don't let baby's size scare you, it doesn't necessarily mean the bigger the baby the more pain you will be in. My 7.9 pounder hurt MUCH worse than my 9 pounder.",

    "question": "Im 38 weeks with my first (a boy). My dr says hes already 7.5 lbs (estimated) and I'm positively enormous.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone keeps asking me if I'm having twins.\u00a0\u00a0I am very very nervous about labor.\u00a0\u00a0I have a really bad back. Three compressed vertebrates, bulging disks, and a previous injury from falling through a glass table that put glass into my spine and caused nerve damage along the same place they put an epidural in.\u00a0\u00a0My dr doesn't seem concerned at all about the epidural... But do they normally put an epidural in a space with compressed vertebrates and a bulging disk?\u00a0\u00a0Ive been having Braxton hicks and false labor contractions since week 26 and they are only getting stronger but every time they get bad i have bad back spasms, shooting pain down my legs, then i will go numb in mt feet and lower legs.\u00a0\u00a0I told my dr and he doesn't seem concerned.\u00a0\u00a0I also have gestational diabetes and low/normal blood preasure (yes..low not high).Am i panicking over nothing or is my dr ignoring my concerns when he shouldn't?",
