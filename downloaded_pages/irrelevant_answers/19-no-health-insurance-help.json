            "answer": "Sounds like you might have either, poor circulation which would cause the\u00a0\u00a0purpley legs, or you might have something to do with your heart. In any case smoking makes both of those worse. You should probably get checked by a doctor, even though you don't have heath insurance, just because It could be something serious. I am 19, and I was just diagnosed with a heart murmur, but I don't have health insurance either.Good luck.",

    "question": "'m 19 about to be twenty, and have had chest pains for about a year. they are localized to the left side of my chest and feel like a sharp pain from front to back. sometimes they seem to be random, but are definitely brought on by exercise. i walk quite a bit, and that usually does not bring the pains on, but running definitely does, even if only for less than thirty minutes, id say get chest pains every few days, sometimes a lot of days in a row, and some times i wont get any for a few weeks, but they are pretty regular. i also have recently noticed symptoms of what i think is poor circulation, like my fingernails are purpleish and my fingers and feet get cold. also the bottom of my feet have purple splotches and spots where the skin seems to be dying. not sure how to describe that, Ive been smoking for almost 4 years and smoking a pack a day for three, i have a bad family history of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes and am scared. any information would be helpful.thanks.",
