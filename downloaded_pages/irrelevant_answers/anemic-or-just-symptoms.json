            "answer": "Just check with your doctor and they'll do the proper tests... Depending on where you live or your daily schedule, it could be a vitamin D deficiency too or just a simple pregnancy symptom. You're muscles are working loads and carrying some extra weight, it's definitely normal!",

    "question": "So for the past couple of weeks or so I have been feeling super exhausted and tired. My limbs feel weak at times and I just don't want to do anything. I had also been craving ice which I hear is a sign of anemia. Im 32 weeks as of Saturday (tomorrow) and my doctor hasn't said anything about me being anemic yet which leads me to thinking maybe it's just a 3rd trimester symptom? Anybody else in the same boat or know what the answer is?",
