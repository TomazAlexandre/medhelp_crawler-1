    "question": "I'm 38 weeks today and I lost my mucous plug Monday/Tuesday so hopefully that means I'm starting to dilate. I was having a lot of Braxton hicks on Monday. Let's see what my doctor says tomorrow. I was 50% effaced at my last appointment but no dilation (last week).On another note, the weight keeps piling on. I seriously look like a whale and it's not doing anything good for my self esteem... I thought it was supposed to taper off?? Why am I still gaining weight!!!! I'm seriously stressing over how in the world will I lose all this weight. I do not have gestational diabetes but I have sure gained weight as if I had it. This is so depressing...I'm just looking forward to the end of the pregnancy. I'll have my beautiful little one and I'll have my body back so I can get started on diet and exercise",
