            "answer": "If you are unhappy with your current medication/s you need to speak with your doctor. Having glucose levels in the \"200 + - range\" is very unhealthy. Better handling of your diabetic diet, exercise regimen, and body weight will help lower your levels. The more it remains >200 mg/dl the higher the chance your \u03b2eta cells are being killed off making one more dependent on insulin.Actos belongs in class of diabetes medications called thiazolidinediones. In this class are Avandia and a combination drug Avandamet [Avandia and Metformin]. Rezulin is in this class but not much known about it. Good luck",

    "question": "Due to a lot of weight gain. My doctor took me off actos and put me on glumetza. I also take glipizide. The gulmetza does not seem to be working for me. My sugars are in the 200 + - range. Is there another generation 1 or 2 diabetes medicine that I can take with the glipizide that will work as good as the actos did and not cost so much? I would like to get off the glumetza. I am really thinking about asking the doctor to put me back on insulin (novolin R). Thank you for your input.",
