            "answer": "Hey Berri,Thanks so much for your advice. Actually, I do not eat a lot of pasta, rice, and other carbohydrates. In fact, I'm pretty much a vegetarian, with a strong preference for salads and raw vegetables of all kinds. I do have a sweet tooth, however, and love chocolate and candy in general. Only Diet Coke; no booze anymore even though I love wine and Margaritas!I'm beginning to think that with my high cholesterol count, high blood pressure (now controlled by meds), and this latest blood sugar reading, I might have metabolic syndrome. I don't know how to fight that except through diet and exercise (as you suggest). I've started walking a mile a day, and have cut out all starches from my diet. My doctor prescribed Zetia which I'm afraid to take because I had a terrible reaction to Lipitor (muscle inflammation). I do eat carrots, however, and also onions. Perhaps I shouldn't?Again, thanks for your kindess in responding, and for your good advice.Stay well!LitDoc",

    "question": "I am currently a Fulbright Scholar in Tunisia. Before I was sent here, I underwent a complete physical which showed a fasting blood sugar count of 125. Nobody said anything except that I needed to be on a diet. How concerned should I be? Medical help is not terrifically accessible here.Thanks!",
