            "answer": "Hi!It all depends on whether the white spot was a T1 or T2 hyperintensity. T1 hyperintensities on basal ganglia may be seen due to calcium, methaemoglobin, or copper deposit, or may be secondary to hepatic failure, carbon monoxide poisoning, an infarct (dead tissue due to no oxygen or blood supply) or uncontrolled diabetes or infections like Japanese encephalitis.T2 hyperintensities or white spots on basal ganglia are seen in ischaemia (no oxygen or blood supply), lymphoma or due to clots in veins. It can also be due to metabolic disorders, neurodegenerative disorders, genetic or mitochondrial diseases, or due to cyanide and carbon monoxide poisoning. Hypoglycemia and methanol poisoning are the other causes.Since you do not have infection, high neutrophils can occur in noninfectious conditions, such as acute myocardial infarction, burns, postoperative, acute gout attacks, acute glomerulonephritis, collagen vascular diseases, rheumatic fever, and hypersensitivity reactions.Actually vitamin D deficiency occurs due to inadequate exposure to sunlight or because of a strict vegetarian diet. Excessive use of sunscreen, kidney problems, having IBS, Crohn\u2019s or celiac disease could be the other risk factors for vitamin D deficiency.So, probably you should think in terms of a liver or kidney affliction. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
