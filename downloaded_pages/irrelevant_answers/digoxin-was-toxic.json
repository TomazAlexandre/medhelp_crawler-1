    "question": "Hello. My name is patient. I have a question. My Doctor has given me heart stents, and those heart stents have failed and were repaired.They gave me to my family doctor to moniter my cholesterol. They said one was slightly high and the other was OK. They stopped me on Lipitor.8 years later I had to have triple bipass surgery diagnosed by the same heart doctor. Just after the surgery, in the hospital, they said it looked like I had diabetes andmy heart had a little bit of funny beating rythm. They put me on coumadin, digoxin, actos, amiodorone, and lipitor. They stopped Actos becausemy family doctor said I did not have sugar. 4 months later I started noticing affects like falling asleep at work or at the wheel of thecar and began taking caffiene pills. I also noticed I was weak and my sight was getting halos and like my eyes were crossing and gettingblurred, besides having abdominal discomfort. At 5 months later, I was overdosed by this heart doctor, on the coumadin that had been moniteredsince the bipass surgery. I was bleeding in my urine, and my cuts were starting to bleed and become irratated red at even the washing of hands.And there was funny stuff inside my body, like gurgling, etc.. I called the doctor and he rushed me to the emergency at the hospital. My monitered INRshould have been 2.5 but a prescription given by this doctor to a pharmacy was twice the amount and I was overdosed to 18 INR. They brought me down to2.5 INR overnight with vitamin K. I noticed my urine go from bloody to clotty to cleared up. At this point I was released from the hospital andwas taken off coumadin, went back to the doctor in a few weeks and he set my next appointment for 4 months later. I didn't feel right about having to pay for thismistake, after the other ones, and sought legal help. They had me get another cardiologist. I still found blood in my urine and was sleepy atthe end of june (or 2 months after the coumadin overdose), with my little cuts lasting for weeks and looking like scarring. The new cardiologist ran tests. The new cardiologist took me off Digoxin.He explained it was just his habit. I noticed things like the cuts healing faster, dark urine but not bloody, and loss of awake not happening at criticaltimes, with an overall feeling better. Then I found on the internet how toxic Digoxin could be with the other medicines I was taking, and that no oneshould be kept on it for very long. Since the second cardiologist removed Digoxin from my prescriptions, and I was healing and getting better, I thinkI must have been under a toxic level of Digoxin causing blood in my urine and poisoning affects of awake,eyesight,cuts,etc.. These were increased afterthe coumadin or warfarin overdose and were not clearing up until I was taken off Digoxin by another Doctor.Here is the question. If my heart beat was a little irregular after triple bipass surgery, but came back to regular beating before I left thehospital and it appeared it had it's regular beat back, just like I really didn't have Diabetes, Should I have been on this potentially toxic Digoxinprescription, that looks to me like it became toxic and would have remained that way for months, or was it mishandleing after triple bipass surgery fromthis Doctor that messed up my stents and overdosed me and more, or should I have been off Digoxin, at least found to be poisoning or something?",
