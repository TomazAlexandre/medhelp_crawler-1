            "answer": "Hi Kerry--Sorry to hear about your Mom. (Both my parents have been battling CHF, so I know it's a bummer, to say the least!)A very good website is http://www.diabetes.org/living-with-diabetes/complications/kidney-disease-nephropathy.html-- The first part of the website in particular explains the relationship between diabetes and kidney function pretty well, I think.Most of our body is water, so when the fluid balance gets off, things can really get messed up. If CHF is untreated, it begins to affect basically every organ in the body, and not in a good way. In CHF, the heart muscle is weakened and it can't always get enough blood to the kidneys for them to do their work properly--their work being to get rid of the waste products from the blood so the waste products don't build up and start poisoning the body.If the kidneys aren't working properly, the body starts retaining more fluid. The fluid's got to go somewhere so it goes places that nature didn't intend and a person becomes increasingly more ill.Hope this makes sense.Is your Mom in the hospital right now?---Yvette",

            "answer": "Hi,How is your mom? Indeed, diabetes can damage the kidneys. High levels of blood sugar make the kidneys filter too much blood. This extra work is hard on the filters of the kidney and after some time, they start to leak. Useful protein is also\u00a0\u00a0lost in the urine. In time, the stress of overwork causes the kidneys to eventually lose their filtering ability. Waste products then start to build up in the blood and the kidneys fail. This kidney failure, or end stage renal disease ( ESRD), is very serious.Kidney transplant or dialysis are usually indicated. I hope this helps. Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Your Mom isn't really mad at the world, she's mad at her situation.Part of the dialysis is finding things to do that she enjoys.\u00a0\u00a0Does she like to read, watch tv, play games, etc?\u00a0\u00a0All of these things can be done during dialysis and seem to make the time pass faster.There is a variation of dialysis that \"might\" help.\u00a0\u00a0If someone was to train to give home hemodialysis, then the amount of time per day could possibly be cut down to 2 hours.\u00a0\u00a0Of course she would have to do it everyday, intstead of 3 days a week.\u00a0\u00a0Besides not having to sit for so many hours at a time, there have been studies that show the death rate of daily users is lower.\u00a0\u00a0The argument is that, most of the toxins are pulled out during the first 2 hours of dialysis, and therefore, the people who do it everyday have a higher sucess rate.Also, with home hemodialysis, one can do dialysis while they sleep.\u00a0\u00a0It's slower and goes on for 8 hours, instead of 3-4.\u00a0\u00a0Your Mom might be happier with the nocturnal dialysis.The other dialysis, that I refused to consider, was perodioneatal(sp?) dialysis.\u00a0\u00a0There is a catheter installed through the stomach wall, and the body cavity is filled with a solution, that supposedly pulls all of the toxins out of the body.\u00a0\u00a0It's done 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and has to be changed about every 5 hours, and the solution weighs about 6 pounds, and is sugar water, adding aprrox. 2,000 calories a day without the benefit of eating.\u00a0\u00a0It's not something they would allow your mother to do, since she is diabetic, but it's an interesting alternative.",
