    "question": "I was just diagnosed with fourth nerve Palsy, I did see my Physican today with another symptom besides double vision, I have numbness below the eye in question around the check bone and a little lower.Could this be that it's spreading to the fifth nerve & is that serious? What is the treatment?I was told I have to wear Mono vision contacts instead of bifocal contacts which of course I don't see as well with the Mono. I am very interested in the cure if any & if it could get worse & what happens.Also how do you get this?Thank you",
