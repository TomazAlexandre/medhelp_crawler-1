            "answer": "Congradulations on your sobriety! This coming from someone that was once in your shoes and now has cirrhosis I'm glad you made a better decision than I did.Have you had an ultra sound done or an MRI? This will tell the condition of your liver such as Fatty, fibrotic or cirrhotic. As your doctor may have explained it's very important to abstain from any use of alcohol. It is impossible for anyone to tell you how long recovery will take since there are too many varibles from person to person.A low fat diet and exercise can be very helpful depending on your situation. Although you should always consult your doctor before beginning any cardio-vascular exercise. Foods that are high in antioxidants will be very helpful. Here is a link that should prove to be helpful and take you in the right direction with your diet.http://www.antioxidantchart.com/how-to-choose-snacks-high-in-antioxidants/Please note: MedHelp does not endorse this website.OTC pills such as Milk Thistle is believed to help detoxify the liver. I take it and so does many others with liver disorders. I don't think there is medical evidence to support that it works but there's none to support it doesnt either. This opinion will vary from doctor to doctor.MedHelp also has an alcoholics forum where you can find advice and support in aiding with your sobriety. I wish the best for you and a speedy recovery! Take care.Randy",
