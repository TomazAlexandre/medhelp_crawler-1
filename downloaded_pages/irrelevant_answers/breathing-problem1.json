            "answer": "HiBreathing problems after eating can be due to severe acidity, gastro-esophageal reflux, hiatal hernia or delayed gastric emptying time. Do you have diabetes or thyroid problem? It could be due to a heavy stomach pressing on your heart and causing the heart to be under strain. All these possibilities have to be ruled out.You must discuss this with your doctor. Meanwhile eat smaller meals, raise the head end of your bed with pillows and eat less of fats. Reduce alcohol, aerated drinks and caffeine.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hello,The breathing problem that you have after eating food is due to acid reflux due to gastroesophageal reflux disease.At such a young age,it is usually after eating a heavy fatty meal and sedantry lifestyle.Eat small nutritious meals at frequent intervals instead of a heavy single meal. Exercise frequently and take your dinner atleast 2 hrs prior to bedtime. Also raise the head end of the bed by 2 blocks. To help control the stomach acid, one should not drink alcohol or drinks with caffeine in them, or eat chocolate or spicy or greasy foods .Also take a healthy,balanced and nutritious diet consisting more of fruits,salads,soups and raw vegetables(after proper washing).Also increase the protein content in your diet instead of carbohydrates and fats.An advice from a dietician will be helpful.Take some OTC antacid like Mylanta.You can also take zantac(ranitidine)or prilosec(omeprazole).These will help.Also keep your fluid electrolyte balance optimum by drinking lots of fluids.If the symptoms persist then pls consult a physician for evaluation.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
