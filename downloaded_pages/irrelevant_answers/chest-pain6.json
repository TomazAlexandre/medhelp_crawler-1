            "answer": "Can you explain a bit more about when the discomfort occurs? what do you have to be doing for it to start? Are you short of breath at all? If you had a stress test and a ct scan, then I doubt if it's the heart. Have you considered a dental problem or even sinus infection? The ache you get from angina is the same as the discomfort you feel from sinus infections, I've had both and couldn't tell the difference. I assumed I had an abscess but an xray revealed the sinus in my lower jaw was blocked due to infection. It is painful and theres a dull ache all the time.",

            "answer": "I may have commented to you before and asked your age.I doubt if your chest pain/discomfort is sinus related.That was ed's experience but as much chest pain as I have seen in patients I doubt that facial area of sinus is the problem, even if that maxillary sinus refers pain and I suspect that the performance of a cardiac cath eliminated that etiology. Have your doctors consider atypical angina like pain from the microvessels of your heart; the cath will show clear coronaries but can't look at the tiny microvessels. Read my journal here at joanincarolina and see if you can see any similarities especially if the chest tightness/pain is related to exertion and causes shortness of breath.Joan.",

    "question": "I have been have episodes of left chest pain and jaw pain for about 2 months. I have had a stress echo which was normal. I had a cardiac ct with calcium scoring in which my calcium score was 0 and my arteries were clear ( they couldn't see my right coronary artery completely but they assured me it wasn't my heart). I have been on Nexium for my stomach and have been referred to a GI doctor but I continue to have this pain and jaw tightness. I am 43 years old and don't smoke and my cholesterol is fine. No high blood pressure or diabetes either.Does anyone have any suggestions as to what could be causing this pain and making me feel so bad. I wish I could just feel normal if it isn't my heart. It makes me worry that the pain is still here.thanks for listening.",
