            "answer": "Dear Sandy,These symptoms you describe can certainly be caused by diabetic neuropathy. The best defense and treatment for this is to improve the self monitoring of blood glucose, keeping it at normal levels helps prevent the problems. i can sympathize because i have a bit of the neuropathy in my foot and this may be from the fact that at the beginning of my 31 years as a diabetic they didn't control blood glucose as well as they can now. But i hate to talk like i'm lecturing and am only making a suggestion that anyone in the field of diabetes treatment would agree with. take care, bret",
