            "answer": "Not seeing a doctor at least once in a while doesn't sound like a good plan (although it's understandable if your doctor is awful and you can't switch).\u00a0\u00a0Coping skills are certainly and essential part of dealing with bipolar disorder, but they are far from enough for the majority of people with the illness.I have my problems with this analogy, but consider diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Being aware of good eating habits and controlling your blood sugar through diet is essential, but if you have type 1 diabetes, you need your insulin if you want to live to an old age.\u00a0\u00a0Chronic high blood sugars wreak havoc on all of your body systems after a while.\u00a0\u00a0There's some evidence that untreated bipolar disorder can do the same to your brain, getting worse if left untreated.\u00a0\u00a0Saying that you shouldn't take medicine for a chronic disease because you can't cure it is a shortsighted view that ignores the implications of not fully treating it.Some people do manage without meds, but going without any medications ever is something that most people with bipolar can't do and stay healthy.\u00a0\u00a0More power to you if you can, but you should get checked out by someone who can look at the situation objectively every once in a while.",
