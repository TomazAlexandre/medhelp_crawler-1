It did with me.\u00a0\u00a0I waited about 4 days with my first one thinking I was being silly about it.\u00a0\u00a0It's worth a trip to the doctor to have checked out.\u00a0\u00a0Then again, there can be missed or skipped beats in a healthy heart.\u00a0\u00a0But it is a better idea to know what is causing your missed beats and chest pains.\u00a0\u00a0Take care, Ally",

    "question": "I have some weird heard beats along with some dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0I can feel my heartbeat fast when I am asleep and sometimes I do not feel my heartbeat at all.\u00a0\u00a0Its scares me and it feels like my heart stopped but I know its beating, I just can hardly feel it.\u00a0\u00a0Have had chest pains for 3 days but they go away so I doubt its something alarming.\u00a0\u00a0Have not seen a doctor because since it goes away and comes back, maybe its just something I am doing.\u00a0\u00a0I have had weird heart beats since I was younger but the EKG would come out normal.\u00a0\u00a0My family does have a history of Diabetes, high blood pressure, thyroid and heart diseas.\u00a0\u00a0Got checked in May and was clear of all those although my blood pressure was borderline high.\u00a0\u00a0Would you know what this weird heartbeat may be?",
