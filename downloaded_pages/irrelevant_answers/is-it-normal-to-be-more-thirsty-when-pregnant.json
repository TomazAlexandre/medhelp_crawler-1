My story is that I am pretty sure I'm pregnant maybe about 4-5 1/2 weeks or so. I have been feeling a pressure/crampy feeling in my pelvic/lower abdomen area, I've had headaches like crazy!! I've been beyond EXTREMLEY thirsty, the comment about the sahara desert is me. I get up a couple times a night just to get a drink. Also, I usually love eating citrus fruits, this past Sunday my mom peeled one and walked by me and just the smell of it gagged me. I don't have \"morning sickness\" just certain smells gag me now. I also forgot to put my laundry in the dryer the other day and for some reason I cried about it. I haven't cried in probably over a yr. I am like 70/30 that I am pregnant I would just like Yalls opinions as well. Please. Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated!",
