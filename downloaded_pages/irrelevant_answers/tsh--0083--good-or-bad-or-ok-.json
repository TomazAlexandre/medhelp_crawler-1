However, I guess they are trying to shrink the goiter...hopefully I will know more at my next visit. I feel lost when I don't know what is ok and what is not...so I just muddle through.Take care of yourself.",

            "answer": "TSH is a pituitary hormone, and doesn't paint the full thyroid picture. For example, I have Hashimoto's thyroid disease. My TSH never went above 2.74. It is now a 0.04 thanks to my thyroid hormone. My endo is not concerned about my TSH. He treats my symptoms and my FreeT4 and FreeT3. Frees are active thyroid hormone.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "Dottie, many thyroid sufferers have more than one auto-immunity, example: thyroid disease and diabetes or Sjrogen's. I suggest monitoring your glucose.Also, there is a lot of research on auto-immune disease and triggers such as yeast, antibiotics, gluten, etc....When I have to go on antibiotics, I eat yogurt to balance out the enzymes. I have eliminated gluten from my diet and am feeling much better. Everyone is different but maybe looking into your dietary habits and cutting something each week to see if you feel better. Soy, dairy, gluten, wheat, sugar, high fructose corn syrup...Here's an excellent website on Leaky Gut Syndrome and its association with auto-immune diseases, as well as triggers. http://www.leakygut.co.uk/index.htmFinally, I suggest going to the doc who put you on Armour and asking for a FreeT3 and FreeT4 test. You may need to have your dosage adjusted.:) Tamra",
