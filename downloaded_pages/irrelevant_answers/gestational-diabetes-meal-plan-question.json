            "answer": "Oh, yes I've been right there with you! :) Even before I got pregnant and developed GD, when I was ready to eat I was ready to eat! Oh, goodness please don't let me get hot and hungry at the same time!! :) But, your body will start to adjust to the new diet after 2 weeks or so. Once you eat and have to wait 2 hours, sometimes I'm ready to eat before then, but you can drink water to help keep you a little full. The good thing is they want us eating every 3 hours, at least. I like that. :) Like you said, we really don't have to change our diet too much. What I've discovered is watching out for the starches (they turn into sugar), sweets, fried foods, and portion control. We can have things, just in moderation. If you have high readings, either write down what you wrote or keep that meal in mind and adjust accordingly. You'll get the hang of it. Good luck and best wishes!",

            "answer": "@Chrissyh81, I'm glad you found this helpful! I did lose weight with being on the new meal plan and especially in the beginning of the diet. Now my weight is basically leveled out. I'm 37+2 and have barely gained weight since having GD and being on the new diet. Oh, and I know for me, my water intake has increased a lot! Maybe that has something to do with my weight, but I have noticed I'm more thirsty and mainly for cold water. So, if this should happen to you ladies do not worry and it is normal.",

    "question": "So this week I was told I had gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone to my dietician and she gave me a meal plan. Its really not a bad plan. I am not having to change what I eat too much. Really just removing alot of sugar. My problem is I constantly feel hungry. It makes eating something I look forward to more. My question is did it take time for your body to get use to eating less or just following the meals? I get pretty cranky when I constantly feel hungry. And my mood really effects how my family feels for the day! The saying is true. If momma ain't happy ain't nobody happy.",
