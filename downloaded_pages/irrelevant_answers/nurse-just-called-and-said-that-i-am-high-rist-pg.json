            "answer": "Sorry to hear about the high BP.I had gestational diabetes with my second pregnancy and had non-stress tests twice a week also.\u00a0\u00a0Although it was different problem, I believe they will be looking for the same thing -- a healthy, vital placenta.\u00a0\u00a0They want to see if it is still working like it is supposed to.\u00a0\u00a0The NST look for several spans of movement by the baby with increased heart etc.\u00a0\u00a0This, according to my NST technician, lets them know the placenta is still working properly.With my 1st pregnancy I found out I had preeclempsia at 36 weeks, which includes high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0They made me lay on my left side and I ended up having the baby early.\u00a0\u00a0From what I understand the high BP affects you more than the baby.Hope that helps a little and God bless!",
