    "question": "Hi! I'm only 8 weeks pregnant and my OB blood work showed my sugar levels were high. So now I'm going on 3 wks of testing my glucose levels 4x a day and logging my food. My fasting levels are consistently high...but not by much. I seems like everyone else is way further along in there pregnancy that is dealing with this. I guess my question is has anyone else been diagnosed with gestational diabetes during there first trimester? I'm terrified of have to be medicated,\u00a0\u00a0needing insulin shots, or having a massive baby via c-section on my 3rd time around.",
