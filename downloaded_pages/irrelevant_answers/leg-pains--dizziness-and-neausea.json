            "answer": "I have those spells too. My eyes roll upward and it turns black in front of my eyes. It usually happens while driving going 75 mph. I pull over and get my ProAir inhaler. It is not a panic attack or breathing problem. It just helps. I have the same symptoms but I do not freak out anymore. I just find a seat while my body recovers. The doctors do not know what or why it is happening. When it happens just sit down and relax. It will go away. I'm not epiletic. Just wait until your vision goes triple vision with your eyes rolling upward, body goes loosy-goosy. It is like you are underwater drowning looking through total air bubbles having a total freak out trying to regain your balance.",

    "question": "My uncle probably has Type II Diabetes and his legs always are on pain and numb. He doesn't really describe how painful it is and the doctor said they don't know what caused it (which is suspicious. A doctor should know). I suspect it to be neuropathy. He will always yelled that his legs are so painful. On the other hand, he have these worries and uncomfortable symptoms such as muttering words like he is dying and that something he act strangely. He will said that he is scared and ask something like \"Is that a ghost?\" and sometimes his eyes will go upwards (like he is about to faint). Is he having a panic attack or panic disorder? I hope I am posting at the right topic. Any advice and tips are highly appreciated.",
