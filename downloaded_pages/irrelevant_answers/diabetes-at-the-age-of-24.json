            "answer": "I understand your being scared, jesima, but the key is information. I was a bit confused by your post as to whether you have gestational diabetes or Type II because you say \"I am planning to have a baby soon\" so not sure if you are pregnant or just thinking about it. The fact that you got tested almost by accident is a good thing because then you can do something about it if you have diabetes! Diabetes is a sneaky disease that often doesn't have symptoms until it is fairly advanced. If those are A1C numbers that is quite high.I agree with wave rider that you need to learn more. First thing is to claify with your doc if you are pre-diabetic, Type II or gestational (if you are pregnant). Then work with your doctor and/or a diabetic educator to figure out how to control your blood sugar with diet and exercise. If you are Type II you will want to get a glucose meter to test your own blood sugar to see how foods influence it. I don't know much about gestational and how it differs from type II but I'm sure you can find information.",

            "answer": "Hi,the worst news will only come if you don't manage diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible to get this young.Even more important that you manage it now if you want to have a baby.\u00a0\u00a0Uncontrolled diabetes in early pregnancy can cause heart and other damage to the baby.\u00a0\u00a0Uncontrolled diabetes later in the pregnancy also is dangerous for mother and baby.however, it can all be controlled and managed.So next step for you is to see a doctor, get properly tested, and to read up and start modifying your diet and activity.\u00a0\u00a0You may or may not need meds to get this controlled.Oh, bread and jam for me is very 'bad' in that it will give me elevated blood sugar, guaranteed.\u00a0\u00a0Things like plain oatmeal may be better....Best wishes, start managing this now and you won't have major problems down the track.\u00a0\u00a0thank your lucky stars that you could find this out before you have symptoms, problems and before you get pregnant.",

            "answer": "\"yes... it's stated they : 5 something to 8.0... she told me that i am excatly at the border.\"When dealing with health issues, especially when it comes to lab test ranges, one has to be exact and not say \"5 something to 8.0\". That's like saying it is daytime but could be late evening.The range values of mmo/l glucose are:Low limit = 3.8-3.9 mmol/lHigh limit = 6.1 mmol/lIf you are borderline diabetic now is the time to get it lowered. Its not hard. However, if you ignore it and let it go it will become full blown diabetes and there is no cure once you reach that stage. Getting there is real easy and can happen today unless one takes prevention.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of people are afraid of hearing the truth, but the truth doesn't hurt when it comes to health care. You have to think of it this way; by walking in to see a doctor at his/hers office and getting the information, medication, and advice to treat an illness is better than getting it on your back in the hospital. You can get all the advice and opinions on a forum but then what? You still need to see a doctor. If you plan on having a baby then see the doctor for the babies sake. An unhealthy mother does the baby no good. Please pay attention to what super_sally said.",
