Long list, but most annoying-fatigue, as in going to a friends house for a bbq and couldn't make it through the afternoon without napping, painful, swollen legs and feet (kankles.) Sluggish GI, which I take myralax everyday, plus magnesium and fiber, feeling like I have pms all the time, social isolation, anxiety, which I'm on pamelor, Loss of sex drive, lose words/fuzzy thinking, times of unusually high energy, migraines, double vision, (which I have prism 3 in my glasses.)

            "answer": "A majority of hypo patients taking large doses of T4 med do not adequately convert the T4 to T3.\u00a0\u00a0This results in a Free T3 level in the lower end of the range or below.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors that practice \"Reference Range Endocrinology will tell you that any FT3 and FT4 test result that falls within even the very low end of the range is in the so-called \"normal\" range and adequate for you.\u00a0\u00a0This is incorrect.\u00a0\u00a0the ranges are too broad, since they have never been corrected as was done for TSH over 8 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0If the FT3 and FT4 ranges were purged of suspect hypo patient data, as was done for TSH, and the ranges recalculated, the new ranges would be more like the upper half of the current ranges.That is why we hear from so many members with FT3 and FT4 in the lower end of the range and they still have hypo symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Many of our members report that symptom relief for them require that Free T3 was adjusted into the upper third of the range and free T4 adjusted to around the midpoint of the range.A good thyroid doctor will treat a hypo patient clinically by testing and adjusting Free T3 and free T4 as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief should be all important, not just test results.\u00a0\u00a0You don't necessarily need an Endo, just a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0In fact Endos seem to be more rigid about using TSH as a diagnostic and using \"Reference Range Endocrinology\" than others.You can get more insight into clinical treatment from this link to a letter written by a good thyroid doctor for patients that he consults with from a distance.\u00a0\u00a0the letter is sent to the PCP of the patient to help guide treatment.http://hormonerestoration.com/files/ThyroidPMD.pdfIn the letter, note this statement.\u00a0\u00a0\"The ultimate criterion for dose adjustment must always be the clinical response. I have prescribed natural dessicated thyroid for your patient (Armour or Nature-Throid). These contain T4 and T3 (40mcg and 9mcg respectivelyper 60mg). They are more effective than T4 therapy for most patients. Since they provide more T3 than the thyroid gland produces, the well-replaced patient\u2019s free T4 will be around the middle of its range or lower, and the FT3 will be high-\u201cnormal\u201d or slightly high before the AM dose.\"",

My doc doesn't even test the T3 and she is supposedly, one of the best endos in my area. I was under the impression that I HAD to go to an endo for my hypothyroid. I will look into other doctors now. Thanks again.",

            "answer": "Just an update. The appointment went better than I thought, but in the long run, I'm still seeking out a new doctor. She did put me on 5mcg of cytomel, but brought down my levothyroxin to 200mcg. I pleaded with her for more tests and she did order a bunch of labs for me, yet, doesn't want to see me for 3 more months. Last, as she was about to leave the room, I asked her about possible pituitary and adrenal problems. She stated, 'Those things have nothing to do with thyroid function.' That was the end all. I knew then, she would never be able to really help me.",

    "question": "I used to inline skate 14 miles, 3 times a week and belly dance 2-3 times a week, (sometimes more if we were performing.) I could never lose those proverbial 10 pounds and docs just told me I had hit my plateau. When I stopped doing this much, within 6 months, I had gained 40 pounds. Docs then just told me I was getting older and, 'nesting.'Last year, I was finally diagnosed with Hashi's first, then cancer, and I had my thyroid removed in Nov of last year. After the surgery, I gained another 25 pounds. My current endo only testes my T4 and TSH. She has me on 200mcg of levothyroxin. Since she only wants to see me every 3 months and she didn't bump up my dose last visit, because my TSH was at 4.33 and my T4 is at 1.1. I have bumped myself up to 300mcg, without feeling any better. I have read in books and online that Hashi's antibodies also attack the pituitary gland. Even without my thyroid, I still have the antibodies in my blood. I also had a severe head injury, almost 2 year ago, that I understand can also cause havoc on the pituitary.I have also read that my adrenals should be checked, along with a slew of other tests.I have an appointment on Monday with my endo. How can I gently request these tests? I know if she refuses this, I should find another doc. I do have insurance, but with a 40 dollar co-pay, each visit. I live in the central Florida area. I know a lot of you have had similar frustrations with your docs. How do you find out if am endo doctor is educated enough about thyroid and not just diabetes? I have looked online for other endo's, but all the patient reviews have been for diabetes. I guess I just rambled on for a basic question of; Where can I find an endo that is educated enough in thyroid problems? Well, I don't have a thyroid anymore.",
