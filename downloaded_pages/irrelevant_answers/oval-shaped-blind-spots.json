    "question": "I noticed a small oval-shaped spot which flashed on and off with every blink of the right eye, when i looked at the sky. Indoors, it would be seen as an oval shadow spot. if i looked at a book with the good eye closed, the letters i would focus on would be seen clearly but the oval spot would hover over some lines above, and there would be no vision in that area. I got an internal exam done but the eye was found to be healthy. The doctor said that it could be a floater.My vision was judged at 20/20Now within a year, i have another oval spot just below the first one and i am worried.I have diabetes Mellitus 2, which is well controlled and blood pressure at 140/90.What is this condition and what should i do?",
