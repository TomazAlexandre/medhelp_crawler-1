            "answer": "Hi Cindy..Leakage of urine has many causes, like weakness of pelvic floor muscles, it can be neurological, or it can be due to an obstruction or a trauma.. but if you never had a spinal injury or a pelvic fracture or you're not taking any medications that have urinary incontinence in their list of side effects, then it's most probably due to pelvic floor muscles weakness, i think... There is an exercise called the Kegel exercise that may help; it strengthen's the pelvic floor muscles which support the bladder.. You can read about it here (http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/kegel-exercises/WO00119).. Hope this\u00a0\u00a0helps..Even though this might help, I think you better go see a urologist cos he/she is the only person can you the best advice..Take care..",
