I read up on research aboutpeople who have MS and their chances of getting diabetes , and\u00a0\u00a0it would appear I fit right into that study as I am a diabetic and have only been a type 1 for 12 years, and in my timeline we know that I had my first MS experience 15 years ago, after reading the research I think the MS is what triggered my diabetes, funny thing is I have been dealing with the diabetes for 12 years I have been dealing with the Ms 1 year.almost like which came first the chicken or the egg.....Cindi",

I could see the point-- maybe-- if \"older\" siblings were involved, since it seems at least possible that changes in the mother from having given birth could affect a new fetus at conception or during development.After one is born, however, there is obviously no chance of genetic changes. Is it being suggested that the mere presence of a \"younger\" child (environment) during certain formative years has an affect on MS? And that that child, to have an affect, would have to be a sibling?Sherry, could you post the source of that article?\u00a0\u00a0The author will have more than an uphill battle to convince me.Thanks,ess",
