            "answer": "Please go see a doctor. You could have a potentially serious medical problem. One thing they will check you for is diabetes. An extremely high sugar can cause your symptoms, and there's probably several other things that could. If they don't readily identify a cause, they may want to do a sleep study for possible sleep disorders. Please let us know what your doctor says.",

            "answer": "First you need to relax. This may not be as serious as it seems.\u00a0\u00a0I had the same symptoms and I visited the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You may have extremely low hemoglobin levels, which means you have an iron deficiency. You must go to the doctor first just to make sure!! And they should give you a list of the foods that are rich in iron. Like, canned clams, chicken and beef livers, and legumes.\u00a0\u00a0Try eating at least one bowl of iron enriched cereal a day.\u00a0\u00a0It will take quite awhile to get the levels back to normal but you have to stick to the iron diet!! I did and its really starting to pay off :) Good luck and wish you all the best!",
