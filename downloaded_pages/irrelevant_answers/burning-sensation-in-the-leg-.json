            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There is a chance that you have compression of the spinal nerves in the lumbo-sacral spine region. This can happen due to overuse of the lower back as in work requiring too much of bending, lifting weight, fall on the back, overweight, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. Poor posture while sleeping, sitting on computers or jobs for a long time, uneven bed, exposure of back to cold air while sleeping can cause a discomfort for a few days. Please consult a neurologist. A MRI of the spine is definitely required. Take a multivitamin, plenty of fluids, and an OTC analgesic. Apply a local analgesic and sleep with a hot water bottle and see if it helps.The other possibility is peripheral neuropathy due to Lyme\u2019s, lupus, diabetes, hypothyroidism, low calcium, low Vit B12 or due to low Vit D.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Hope this helps. Take care!",
