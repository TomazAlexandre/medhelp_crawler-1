    "question": "I had my first appointment today with a regular ob and she sent me to another ob who is a high risk doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Im so scared the babies heart beat is only 130 bpm but it is moving like crazy she said it was a good sign and to have hope I am about 14 weeks along already. I also have diabetes type one (was diagnosed today) I have three specialist plus my ob. I am already scheduled for four different ultrasounds in the next month.. I have a stricked diet and on top of that I already have restrictions like I can't pick up my 3 year old son I can only do half loads of laundry.. I hate restrictions caus it makes me feel like im useless.\u00a0\u00a0I have so much going on in my head right now I really need the reassurance and prayers.",
