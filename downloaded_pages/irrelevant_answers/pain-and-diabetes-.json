GET A NEW MD\u00a0\u00a0first he tells you you have neropathy from diabetes and then does NOTHING to control your BG\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0WTH",

He did tell me to come after my 2HR test\u00a0\u00a0I haven't been able to go to him.\u00a0\u00a0Will see what regimen he suggests.some other doctors told me the same thing\u00a0\u00a0that neuropathy doesn't occur at this bg level\u00a0\u00a0but then they said no treatment is required for diabetes right now as my levels are not high enough. Only my first MD was asking for treatment. Its quite strange. I had high level of\u00a0\u00a0anxiety due to a protected encounter with a CSW. All my HIV ,hbsag,hcv.tests are negative uptill 7 months. Has anxiety combined with diabetes done this to me?I have lipomas too could they be the reason? as some times it feels like my skin is stretched from the inside.",

            "answer": "Hello,normal fasting blood sugar is in the range of 75 - 90Normal after eating (2 hours) is 120 or Less.Your numbers are well above normal and your doctors not doing anything to treat you is ridiculous.Some people develop neuropathy at relatively low blood sugars, and others it may not become apparent until later and with higher numbers.\u00a0\u00a0However, please know that blood sugars above 140 are causing damage, which may or may not be reversible (if and when you can control your sugars).Typically if you have diabetes you should take up exercise at least 30 minutes daily, work to ensure your weight is ideal and follow a low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0If these together do not bring your sugars back to normal, then first line medication is metformin.\u00a0\u00a0If metformin does not bring your blood sugars down (in combo with diet and exercise), then they need to test you for antibodies to be sure that you do have type 2 diabetes.Anyway, diabetes is a condition to take seriously.\u00a0\u00a0Your levels are not terrible yet, but certainly also should not be ignored and no action taken.If you do nothing now then regardless of what this pain is, you will end up with diabetic neuropathy.Read up on diabetes too.\u00a0\u00a0This is your diabetes and it is your responsibility to manage it.You can manage this.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there and take 1 day at a time.\u00a0\u00a0Learn as much as you can! :)",

    "question": "Hello all. I was diagnosed with diabetes 8 moths ago. All my labs tests were normal except diabetes. I had pain under armpits\u00a0\u00a0on chest and thighs n groin area.\u00a0\u00a0My internist told me its muscular neuropathy caused by diabetes. Put me on citalopram and painkillers. My 2HR glucose was 117 and after 2hrs 170\u00a0\u00a0.generally my sugar level is higher above 150 at random. I still have under arm pain and thighs pain though it has lessened now. But when it returns ,I feel bouts of anxiety and stress. I'm not on diabetes treatment. I believe I had diabetes since long. I have lipomas, when they form I'm in extreme pain. Can Neuropathy be caused by sugar levels like mine?",
