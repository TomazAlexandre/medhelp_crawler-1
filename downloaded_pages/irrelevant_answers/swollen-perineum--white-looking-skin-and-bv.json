I am surprised your physician didn't investigate these symptoms further. All that needs to be done is a culture to see if it is a fungal infection.. It this doesn't clear up by Monday, I would advise you set up a follow up appointment and make these symptoms CLEAR to your GP. I am sorry you are so uncomfortable and in pain hun!Good luck sweetie!~VQ",
