            "answer": "Hello,One of the reasons for these symptoms is dry orgasms when a man reaches sexual climax but doesn't ejaculate semen or does not have ejaculation. It may be due to inadequate production of semen or retrograde ejaculation when the semen goes into the bladder instead of out through the penis. Common cause of such symptoms are ejaculatory duct obstruction, diabetes, medications for treating high blood pressure, prostate enlargement and mood disorders, retrograde ejaculation, multiple sclerosis, spinal cord injury or seminal vesicle obstruction.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
