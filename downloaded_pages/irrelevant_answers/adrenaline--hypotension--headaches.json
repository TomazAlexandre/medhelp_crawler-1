            "answer": "Not sure why the hypotension, maybe systemic viral infection, maybe diabetes, excessive diarrea, dehydration, etc.Adrenaline rush such as standing from a seated or lying position, climbing stairs, running, bending over, sudden fear or anger.\u00a0\u00a0Taking a hot shower always brings on the worst short term headache.",

            "answer": "Hi,Blood pressure varies when lying down or standing up.When one stands abruptly from a lying position, the body has to adjust to this. Blood pools in the lower extremities and when one stands up the blood pressure drops momentarily.But the body is quick to respond, by increasing heart rate and constricting\u00a0\u00a0blood vessels via the action of your nerves.This increases blood flow to the heart and to the brain.You may be able to experience throbbing pain or sudden dizziness when this happens.If you are hypotensive, the pain may be due to lack of blood flow or oxygenation to the brain.Hypotension due to acute blood loss or dehydration needs immediate intervention. However, with hypotension other associated symptoms should be noted eg dizziness,weakness, faintness, pallor and increase in heart rate.Evaluation of the heart and neck vessels may also be necessary in your case.",

            "answer": "Hi thereI dont know about the hypotension, but i get adrenaline rush all the time from anxiety and when its particularly intense I do get a temporary headache and i think its from all the adrenaline or the tension and strain you put on your muscles including neck and head, but this pain is usually temporary and goes away as soon as my anxiety decreases. I hope this helps. Good luck.",
