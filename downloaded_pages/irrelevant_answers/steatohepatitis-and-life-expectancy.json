            "answer": "What a shame the doctor spoke to you that way. It doesn't help anything to scare you. Rather than plan your death, you can plan how you will treat your condition. There is a lot you can do to treat NASH. Please do some research on treatments and what you can do. I'd get a second opinion, someone who has a more positive view. Controlling the diabetes is very important as is excellent diet plan and proper exercise. Eating a liver friendly diet and regular exercise greatly benefit you.Read up on NASH and hopefully that will reduce your fear level and empower you to improve your health.Here is a website with some good info about NASHhttp://patients.uptodate.com/topic.asp?file=livr_dis/5305",

            "answer": "I have lived with (pediatric onset) NASH for over 12 years now. It is a difficult thing to live with but you can live. It is only diet and exercise controlled. I am assuming that since this post was 2006 you have learned alot about it. It is NON-ALCOHOLIC form and yes sir it is very genetic. I was 15 when i finally got the diagnosis via liver biopsy, and already had lots of fibrosis and mild chirrosis. Now it has progressed, and I love my life, and cherrish everyday with my children and family. Don't look forward to it killing you just live the best you can and make sure to follow a strict diet with xercise and your liver disease will not progress fast. Also another thing is you should try if you havent already, Milk Thistle. It can be bought over the counter from the vitamin section of any pharmacy. This is proven to help with Diabetes as well as to regenerate the liver. :)",

I am also type 2 diabetic and believe that this is because of the liver condition.What I can't relate to is how did I contract this condition in the first place? (I am not a alcohol drinker at all)Is this genetic? and what can I do beside diet to prolong my life?I am very scared and suffer panic attacks and associated conditons because of my fears",
