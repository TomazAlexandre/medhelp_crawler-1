            "answer": "The fact that it dropped that low an hour after treating is a cause for concern. Yes, I would see your doctor right away or go to the ER if you can't your blood sugar stable. You need to tell people near you what the warning signs are of hypoglycemia and to give you the glucose gel if you are disoriented. If you are not able to respond and swallow though they shouldn't try and give you anything but should call 911. You don't say if you are taking any medications. If so, and especially if it is insulin, it could be too high a dose for you and needs to be evaluated right away.There is a very knowledgeable person on this board named waverider and I hope he will read your post and add to my comments. I had a serious episode of hypoglycemia recently and I know it can be scary. It sounds like you handled it well but don't hesitate to get help. Better to be safe.",

You're popping something you have no clue about? Sorry, but you should know exactly what you're taking, how much you're taking and when you were told to take a medicine.\"I was just diagnosed.\"Who? How? If your glucose is dropping like this it appears you were misdiagnosed. Call your doctor today and demand to see him/her to find out the cause(s) of your crash. As you know, it is dangerous and can lead to coma unless treated properly.",

            "answer": "Bottom line is that you and your doctor don't seem to be managing your diabetes very well. I think you probably need a bit more medical expertise in treating DM2 than a \"general practitioner\" can provide. I recommend you seek medical advise from an Internal Medicine specialist with expertise in treating DM2 or an endocrinologist.People on this site really want to help you stay healthy and manage your DM2. We sometime come at you very directly to let you know the potential seriousness of uncontrolled DM2--it can kill or cripple you. Get use to it--we care about you.troytroy",
