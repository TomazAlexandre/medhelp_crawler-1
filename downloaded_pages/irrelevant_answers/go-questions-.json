            "answer": "First of all don't ever consider anything about you a failure, you are just experiencing something a little different with this pregnancy :) There are many cases where you can not pass the 1 hour but pass the 3 hour. For now just cut back on your sugar intake. Have you gained allot of weight this pregnancy? That can be a sign of gestational diabetes. Definitely don't eat anything sugary 12 hours before your test. I haven't done a 3 hr test so I am not sure if you need to fast but I definitely would suggest staying away from the sugar until you know more. The Dr will be able to help you with your diet if need be. Good luck and stay positive",

            "answer": "With my previous pregnancy, I had to do the 3 hour test and you do have to fast. The lab tech told me at the beginning that my blood sugar level was 86 & that I was definitely not diabetic. Stinky thing was, I still had to do it. I suggest taking a snack or small lunch to eat immediately after you complete the test. Also, you may drink water during the 3 hours. Yay. I got nauseous from fasting so long so that's why the snack, but eat slowly!",

            "answer": "I took the 3 hour and did have to fast. I took it 1st think in the morning so i wasnt going to be hungry. That helped. I didnt alter my eating aside from nothing crazy sugary the night before so i wouldnt mess up the results of the test. I passed just fine in all but 1 of 4 tests which is still a pass. It seems like a whole lot of people are failing the 1 hour but do fine on the 3. I was nervous cuz i gained a lot and hate needles, but was glad to get it over with and know it wasnt anything i was doing wrong. My body just didnt break down the sugar as fast as it should on the failed one. I think it was the 3rd test.",
