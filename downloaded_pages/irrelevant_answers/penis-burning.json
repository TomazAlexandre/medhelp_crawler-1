            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Hope diabetes has been ruled out. The causes for the burning sensation on the penile head are dryness, yeast infections, herpes, sexually transmitted diseases, genital warts, allergies and balanitis. It could also be due to pemphigus, aphthous ulcers and cancer. If there is accompanying swelling, redness, discharge and fever it is most probably an infection. As most of the causes have been ruled out, it could be due to allergies, herpes or pemphigus.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Look at these two threads. I made an appt with an Osteopath today. I have burning at the tip of the penis and my Doctor and Urologist can find nothing wrong. My lower back started killing me a couple of months ago... a week or so before the burning started. I thought the back pain would go away because I have arthritis... but it hasn't (like the other places on my body have). I was getting ready to get my lower back checked out anyway and some internet searches have kicked out some interesting things out on this subject (in regards to back pain and sacrum alignment). Good luck.http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Mens-Health/Vibration-sensation-in-penis/show/183034http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Neurology/Burning-at-Penis-Tip/show/326612",

    "question": "My Penis burns but it generally starts in the afternoon. I have a \"raw\" feeling at the tip of my penis. I had been to Urologist, Dermatologist.Both Urologist feel it is possibly a problem with a nerve. All my test for any infection has came back negative. This issue started over 3 months ago. One day, I woke up with it.Anyone have any thoughts of what it could be? I had a car wreck in 2003. I had back surgery in 2006. It was a anterior Corpectomy of T11 and T12. They went thru the left side and took out part of a rib to graft into the cage. I have always had pain on the left hand side since surgery.Could I have a nerve that is causing this issue? It is weird that the stinging/burning of the penis generally comes on in the late afternoon. Both Urologist feel the rawness on the tip of Penis is nerve pain related.I have been on 7 different creams with no results; I had a biospy done which was basically negative; I had had Urine Test ran 3 different times' all were negative. I have also taken 4 different Antibiotics over the last 3 months with no success.Any thoughts?Thanks; My Anxiety is thru the roof. I am 54 and in good health besides this issue and my back pain",
