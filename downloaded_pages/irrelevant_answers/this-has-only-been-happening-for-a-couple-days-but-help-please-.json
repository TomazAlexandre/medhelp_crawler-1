            "answer": "Hello. It is not possible to give you a specific answer through the internet and without all your clinical information and a physical exam. Generally speaking, a chest pain can have multiple causes, and the probability of a heart attack to cause this symptom will depend on the age and cardiovascular risk factors of the patient. For example, if the patient is a young female without risk factors (i.e. no smoking, no diabetes, no high cholesterol, and no family history) the probability of a chest pain to be a heart attack is very low and stress, anxiety or anguish. In contrast, a male >65 yo and multiple risk factors, a new chest pain will have a moderate to high probability to be a heart attack. I don't know in what group you would be, but I think it would be reasonable to see a general physician for a checkup if you see that these symptoms persist. Good luck.",
