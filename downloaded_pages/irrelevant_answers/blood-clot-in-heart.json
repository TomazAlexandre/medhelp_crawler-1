            "answer": "I am a 45 years old female with a hx. of diabetes for over 15 years. Actually I take 24units of Insulin 70/30 and Glucophage 500mg twice a day. A few days ago I started with minor chest pain. Went to the emergency room, but the EKG did not reveal a heart attack. Came back to the ER 2 days after, and was hospitalized. Echocardiogram and stress tests irrelevant do termine if I had a heart attack in the past or was going to have one. But cardiac catheterization revealed two blockages. I'm scheduled to have them unblock by angioplasty. Is that my best choice or is conventional medical treatment a better alternative?Please post answer or e-mail me at ***@****Thank you very much!Nelva Ancona-P",

            "answer": "Dear Nelva,This decision is up to your cardiologist and yourself. You should very likely have some form of revascularization.\u00a0\u00a0Please be advised that some trials have shown that diabetics do not do as well with angioplasty and/or stenting as non-diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0You may wish to ask your cardiologist about the adjunctive role of Reopro in this situation if you are to have a stent.If you disease is fairly significant and involves your LAD you may wish to consider surgery as a more lasting approach to revasulcarization.Medical therapy is unlikely to be the answer in your situation.",
