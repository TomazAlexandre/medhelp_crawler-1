            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Alcohol, certain drugs, allergy to food additives, heat intolerance, hot beverages and food, anxiety, orthostatic hypotension, certain endocrine disorders like hyperthyroidism, those involving the adrenals, diabetes etc all cause facial sweating. If there is sweating only during the day and after sports then it could be heat sensitivity.Apply cold compress on and off during the day. Splash a lot of cold water (not freezing cold but cool) on face on and off. See if this helps. Otherwise, consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
