            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You appear to be having some allergy and sleep disturbances. Ideally you should consult a sleep specialist. Sleep disorders can cause an increase in heart rate, blood pressure, loss of freshness after a good night sleep etc. Also rule out possibility of anemia, diabetes and thyroid disorders. Since STDs have been ruled out there is no need to worry on that account. Also the eye symptoms may not be related to your other problems. Since MGD has been diagnosed, the possibility of Sjogren\u2019s syndrome too should be looked at.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
