            "answer": "Hi,It may take some detective work to figure out your situation. First, compare the results to prior--are they higher or lower? It is more concerning ofcourse if the levels are now higher than they were in the past. If they are high but LOWER than in the past, that is another situation and somewhat less concerning .Your levels are high and do require some attention. Diabetes itself can cause elevated liver tests by causing fatty liver disease, so this is one thing your doctor should investigate(usually by liver ultrasound).In your case, the most likely cause is your medications because you are on several cholesterol medications that can cause liver test abnormalities, especially when used together. This may not be just cut-and-dry though--liver tests are to be addressed but your overall cholesterol situation may be more serious than the liver issue and warrant those medications. Definitely speak with your doctor about it, the possibility of the meds as a cause, and other options that are available to you.Take care.",

            "answer": "Also, it doesn't hurt to get a test for hepatitis c.\u00a0\u00a0They don't normally test for that unless you had risk factors (transfusions, IVD drug use) in your past, yet 15 to 20% of the people with hepatitis c never had any of these risk factors.\u00a0\u00a0Just ask your doctor to order a test for the anti-bodies with your next blood draw.",

    "question": "I recently had a blood test and did the Gluclose test which I believe was a 2hr test. One of my test results said the normal ALT levels are 0-70 and my level came in at 116. Would these medications have anything to do with the levels:TriCor 145mgMetformin 850mgLovaza formerly OmaCor 1gmZetia 10mgCrestor 10mgI read liver issues - the blood count can be 10 to 50x higher than the normal high score (i.e. 70) and\u00a0\u00a0also read the meds I am on could also throw the blood counts off a bit. Is this true?",
