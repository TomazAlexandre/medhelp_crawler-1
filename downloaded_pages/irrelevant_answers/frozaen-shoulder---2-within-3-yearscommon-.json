            "answer": "I have had pain in my left shoulder and arm since 09/2008. The orthopedist said that it is Frozen Shoulder and referred me to physical therapy. I went to physical therapy and did stretching exercises for a month and then moved out of state. The physical therapist said that she didn;t think I have Frozen Shoulder because my extension was improving so fast. I am now retired and waiting for OPM to change myinsurance plan (previous one iis not in this state). In the meantime, the pain in my shoulder and arm still wakes me up in the middle of the night. Could it be something else. Planning on seeing a doctor about it but have to wait for the change. The orthopedist based his diagnosis on x-rays alone. The shoulder x-ray was fine but the neck x-ray showed lots of spur and disk problems.",
