            "answer": "Dear Carol, welcome to the medhelp forum. Chronic white matter changes of demyelination and micro vascular ischemic changes on MRI are non-specific. These are suggestive of multiple conditions like small vessel brain disease since this is diagnosed on a CAT/MRI scan done incidentally to investigate other neurological symptoms. It is a finding with possible cause like hypertension, diabetes or hypercholesterolemia. What are your neurological symptoms that called for an MRI brain? This condition can be a precursor of stroke and should be taken as a warning to make lifestyle modifications to prevent a future stroke. These changes can also be seen in migraine headaches. MS plaques are hyperintense on T2 weighted and FLAIR images and hypointense on T1 weighted scans and are located in the periventricular white matter. Enhancement with gadolinium also is seen with MS lesions. There are other MRI related diagnostic criteria, which need to be checked along with the other requirements for MS diagnosis. You need a physician\u2019s supervision to check you for predisposing conditions if you have, and confirm or rule this out. Maintain blood sugar, blood pressure and serum lipid profile. Wish you all the best.",
