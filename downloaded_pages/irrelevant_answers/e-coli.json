            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you father has diabetes, then get this investigated by going for a recent fasting and PP blood sugar, and glycosylated hemoglobin to know overall control. Since he has burning in the urine, get a urine examination done. The fever could be because of this and this could also be the cause for altered taste sensation. Monitor the serum uric acid levels by testing every 3 months. If he has stool problems then get that tested too.In all probability your father has uncontrolled diabetes with low grade urinary infection. Please consult a doctor. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
