            "answer": "Hi there. This history indicates a transient ischemic attack or TIA, which occurs when blood flow to a part of brain stops for a brief period of time, which leads to stroke like symptoms and could be a warning to coming events. This could be due to blood clot in artery, emboli, narrowing in blood vessel of brain due to risks like hypertension, diabetes, atrial fibrillation and high cholesterol. Symptoms are dizziness, altered touch, pain, temperature etc. there may be lack of coordination and balance, muscle weakness of face, arm, leg, numbness or tingling on one side of body etc. Diagnosis is usually based on history. Your clinician may ask for brain MRI, MR angiogram, echo, carotid duplex, and ecg. The management would be according to the diagnosis. Hope this helps. Take care.",

    "question": "I want to see if any of you have heard of this or have similiar symptoms. I am a 24 year old female. It all started when I was 16. I will have these episodes where I have a sharp pain in the back of my head where my head and neck meet and mean while I am completly concious and aware of whats happening but I lose control of my muscles. I still have feeling and they are not rigid but I just can't move any part of my body. These episodes only last between 15-30 seconds and they only happen about every 5-7 months. Following these episodes I feel very drained and continue to have a head ache that spreds throughtout my whole head. I have not had an MRI yet but my CAT scan came back normal. I am set to have an EEG and a heart ultrasound done also. Any ideas or has anyone ever experienced this?",
