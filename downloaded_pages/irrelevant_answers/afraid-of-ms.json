            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since most of the symptoms involve the right side of her body she could having some neurological problem involving one half of your body. There is a chance that she has compression of the spinal nerves in the upper cervical spine region. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. A MRI of the cervical spine and nerve conduction studies may be required. Please consult a neurologist.The other possibility of similar symptoms in one half of body is TIA or transient ischemic attack. This can be ruled out by a CT scan or MRI. To diagnose a TIA or mini stroke you need to have a MRI close to the episode. If TIA is suspected then all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.Yes, MS too is a possibility but one cannot say for sure unless tests are done. Please consult a neurologist. Take care!",
