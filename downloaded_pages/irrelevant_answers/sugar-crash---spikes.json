    "question": "I've recently been diagnosed with type II diabetes and still adjusting my medication and when I had a sugar crash yesterday at lunch I over did my sugar in take and had a sugar spike. It exhausted me, gave me first sweats then chills, nausea all afternoon. I've tried all night eating small portions and hope this morning I would feel better. But now that I'm up I'm still shaking and my blood sugar is 135. How long will I get like this and should I go back to my old dosage.",
