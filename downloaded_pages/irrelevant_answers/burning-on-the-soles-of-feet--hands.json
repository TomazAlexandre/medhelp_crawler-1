            "answer": "Hello,Burning of feel and soles may be due to contact dermatitis,peripheral vascular disease or due to peripheral neuropathy.As you are a female ,so it can be due to menopause also.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Such symptoms are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the burning is gone or not.Also apply calamine lotion on the soles.It will help in soothing the skin.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist/gynecologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder or menopause.A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional doubts.Kind regards.",
