            "answer": "Hi !!\u00a0\u00a0 I started treating 3 weeks ago and am finding that my body is telling me what to eat - similar to being pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Dairy and meat seem to go down well but other things I love,\u00a0\u00a0like grapefruit, have no appeal.\u00a0\u00a0NY Girl is right about taking the Riba with Ben and Jerry's.About the side affects,\u00a0\u00a0geez I thought it was going to be okay judging by the first week, but as I go along, the\u00a0\u00a0interferon sides of fever and chills are not as bad as with the first shot, but the Riba effects are getting worse - if it's possible to isolate the two\u00a0\u00a0The headaches and fatigue are pretty nasty.\u00a0\u00a0 As a side note, I have never taken drugs - rarely even aspirin, so I expected not to have much stamina taking these monsters. And I have never even had the flu!!!All in all though, it's do - able.\u00a0\u00a0It has to be eh?I don't mean to scare you, but it was helpful to me to know from other's experiences what might happen.I wish you the best and am glad you have a supportive husband.Anne",

            "answer": "Hi Bab\u2014You can browse through this site; it\u2019s supported by the U.S. National Institute of Health:http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/searchIt\u2019s tough to sort through all the data, so you\u2019re doctor is likely you\u2019re best bet to help interpret the trials and help you determine which one, if any of them is best suited to your needs.With Stage F2 fibrosis, it\u2019s likely a good idea to wait for a bit and see if other, newer drugs will be more efficacious. For what it\u2019s worth, there\u2019s never been a better time to manage HCV; even if you were diagnosed ten years ago, your odds of success were much smaller then.You can probably eat whatever you like, within reason. There are few dietary restrictions for HCV patients unless cirrhosis is present. There is some evidence that HCV is accompanied by metabolic issues; and example can be early onset of diabetes type 2. There doesn\u2019t seem to be a causal effect, but perhaps an association. For that reason, attention to insulin resistance along with periodic diabetes screening might be beneficial.Some HCV patients also have a tendency toward iron storage issues. You might want to avoid supplemental iron until discussing this with your doctor; he may want to perform iron studies panel. If you take a daily multivitamin, Centrum Silver or generic equivalent is contains no added iron.Good luck and take care---Bill",

    "question": "Level 2 Stage 2Genotype 1A850,000 viral loadenzymnes were goodInfected about 30 years ago from a blood transfusion.So the question is \"to treat or not to treat\".\u00a0\u00a0I have had many mixed emotions on this subject.\u00a0\u00a0Although if there is any chance (50% or better) of getting rid of the virus, I am planning on treatment.\u00a0\u00a0My appointment time is set in a few months with my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0From my understanding we will make sure everything is ready to go for when the new meds are released.\u00a0\u00a0Another thing that gave me a bit more comfort is - that everything will be preauthorized through my insurance company.\u00a0\u00a0So going in I will know what my out of pocket expenses will be.\u00a0\u00a0Now over the next few months I will be doing more research on side effects and so on.\u00a0\u00a0I am planning on taking a positive approach to this.\u00a0\u00a0I know I can beat this.\u00a0\u00a0It may be hard at times but I am very persistent and with the help of my husband we will get through this no matter how difficult it may be at times.\u00a0\u00a0I will also be trying to lose some weight prior to treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I was very active excercised at least 3-6 hours a week previously.\u00a0\u00a0Presently the fatigue has taken over and the excercise has gone by the wayside.\u00a0\u00a0Although I have started trying to walk on my lunch hour at least 3 times a week (roughly 1.5 miles).\u00a0\u00a0Which is not much, but it is a start.\u00a0\u00a0Also I am looking for some ideas of a healthy liver diet.Any suggestions or comments will be greatly appreciated.",
