            "answer": "Well...those conditions, especially Diabetes can cause EDD. If his GP has all his records, known meds, and gave him this than he must think it is safe. I would get a different opinion from his cardiologist and the doc who he sees for the Diabetes if different than the GP. many men in thier 70's are perfectly capable and healthy enough to have use of these meds. I would contact teh cardiologist 1st to see if they recommend this with CHF and high blood pressure.Kimmie",

    "question": "Should a 71 year old man with Congestive Heart Failure, Diabetes, and High Blood Pressure be using Viagra for ED? He is on Rx's for all these conditions. He got ED because of the meds we think. A doctor gave him a sample of Viagra and he's afraid to use it. Should he NOT use it? Thanks!",
