            "answer": "Hi Moco, Its no problem, you just need to some jelqing and streaching, for both of these you need to google pegym, and on the go to the beginners pages for bot jelqing and streaching, also try some kegels but do the reverse ones as well, now by doing these you should start getting better erections back, if you dont think these are working to get your erections back just come back to me, I have a herb list you could try, but please remember you do not push or rush the programs or any of them, if you do you could end up with an even worste ED.Now all these exercises have rules, if you stick to them you should be OK, but plese remember this is not a quick fix to a bigger penis, it will take time, so just have fun and happy jelqing.Good Luck",
