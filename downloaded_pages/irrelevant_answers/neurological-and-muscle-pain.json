            "answer": "Well I went to see an oesteopath and he said that he thinks that I do have carpal tunnel...but the numbness and tingling was also happening in my feet (I forgot to mention that in my post).\u00a0\u00a0So, honestly, I really didn't think it was carpal.\u00a0\u00a0The thing is that I have had this muscle pain since February and I didn't start exercising until about a month ago.I hate not knowing what is wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0It's just a horrible muscle pain, and it makes me feel so tired too!\u00a0\u00a0I've though of maybe Fibromyalgia....Trying to keep a good attitude.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the comment!",

    "question": "I recently posted regarding some tingling and numbness in arms and B12 or diabetes was suggested.\u00a0\u00a0I have since started taking B vitamins and have been very careful about what I eat.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been exercising everyday.\u00a0\u00a0The numbness and tingling has gone completely away - however, I still have severe muscle pain in both forearms.\u00a0\u00a0Can this be related?\u00a0\u00a0It has only been 3 weeks since I started the vitamins.\u00a0\u00a0I borrowed a friend's glucose meter and my blood sugar levels are always around 90 fasting and the highest I have seen it is 146 about 1/2 hour after eating.Thanks!",
