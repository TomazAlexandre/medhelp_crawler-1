            "answer": "Hello.The Current problem of swelling and numbness could be due to a recurrence of the carpal tunnel syndrome. Though a recurrence is rare, it will be a good decision to do an EMG and rule it out.Recent research studies on the recurrence of carpal tunnel syndrome have not been conclusive. But all the researchers do advise an EMG.I hope she recovers from this. There have been cases where CTS has turned chronic. She will benefit from non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.Regards",
