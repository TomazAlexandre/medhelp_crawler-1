I read somewhere that a comprehensive stool test can rule out parasites as the OP test tend to have false negatives. But, i don't know what else to do about my weight loss and health issues.",

    "question": "For the past 6 months, I have experienced multiple symptoms with no explanation. It all began with a really flu-like illness during the summer which started with a low grade fever and loose bowel movements that lasted about a day. After a week, the flu symptoms returned with strong muscle aches, fever and diarrhea. I started panicking and thought it was HIV from my last sexual encounter (3 weeks ago from the date). I was under extreme stress, anxiety and sleep deprived convincing myself that I caught HIV. The symptoms continue and exactly a month later, and a sore throat developed and I woke up with white and clear mucus tickling down the back of my throat. So, I was tested at 2.5 months, 3 months, 3.5 months and lastly 6 months and 1 week all negative. I went to a gastroenterologist who diagnosed me with SIBO at i was having classical symptoms, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, bloating and weight loss. I was given antibiotics and some of the symptoms went away. I just had a colonoscopy and they found a polyp (which was removed) and inflammation in my colon. Nothing else was discussed other than to make a follow up appointment in two weeks to talk about the results in more details. However, no matter what I eat, I continue to lose weight, regardless of negative test results for HIV, diabetes, thyroid and pancreas. Anyone, please help me, i am very depressed and losing interest in living......",
