            "answer": "Hi Chaquita!\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical professional, just a mom of an 18 year old who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months, so any information I provide to you should be verified with your son's doctor.\u00a0\u00a0It is always best to have any noticed health changes checked out by medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0Based on my experience with the healthcare system, I wouldn't make any assumptions.\u00a0\u00a0When it comes to your health, no news is just that...no news.If your son has shown sugar in his urine in the past, this should definitely be checked out.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't think that losing 20 pounds in a month and a half is typical of an 11 year old.\u00a0\u00a0His other symptoms, especially if they are unusual for him should be reported to his physician.\u00a0\u00a0Frequent thirst and urination are typical signs of diabetes, but they are not the only ones.\u00a0\u00a0See what his doctor's office says.\u00a0\u00a0You could always purchase urine test strips (I don't believe that you need a prescription) at your local pharmacy and check him out at home.\u00a0\u00a0There are strips that indicate sugar and also ketones in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0If either of these is positive, you need to get him medical attention immediately as this is very serious.Good luck with your son and please keep us posted as to how he makes out.",

            "answer": "Thank you for taking the time to answer my post, and thanks for letting me know that no news is just that - no news. I just always assume that the doctor will let me know when something is amiss. My children are typically very healthy, so our visits to the clinic are VERY few and far between. In fact, my doctor says that he knows someone in my family is on his/her death bed when I make an appointment:-)I will discuss everything with my doctor, including past blood and urine tests. My son has had various issues with his immune system in the past, and he has had to have two lymph nodes removed for biopsies because they get so large and develop the interior appearance of cancerous nodes. The last one was removed from his neck three years ago, and after an initial report of Hodgkins disease, the node came back clear. Other than the pneumonia, he has been relatively healthy since.Like I said, the weight loss is what concerns me because he hasn't changed his eating habits, and his exercise level is the same as it's always been. I think I will buy the sticks you have mentioned and at least test him before we go in.Once again, thanks for your input. I will let you know what the doctor says after my son's appointment.",

    "question": "About a year ago, my 11 year old son went to the doctor for a respiratory illness. He ended up having pneumonia, but after running a few tests they also found he had sugar in his urine. We were told to come back and have a fasting blood test the following week. I never got any results from that, so I am assuming everything was right where it should be.The reason I am writing now is because over the past month and a half, my son has lost 20 pounds. At first I just thought that he was growing taller and that's why he looked so much thinner. However, after he and his brothers weighed themselves for fun last week, I realized that he dropped a lot. His health seems to be in tip top shape other than recent complaints of weak and painful legs and an occasional belly ache. The only difference I notice between him and his brothers is that he is flushed in the face quite often and he goes to bed a bit earlier than the rest of the crew. He doesn't seem to be drinking or going to the bathroom any more than he ever has.I made a doctor's appointment for him and will be taking him Wednesday, but I feel a little foolish because he seems pretty healthy. My coworkers said I need to get him in because these could be signs of diabetes. My father, 5 uncles, 3 aunts, and 2 cousins have type 2, but I've only heard of 2 people in the family having type 1 - my great uncle and my father's cousin.Should I be asking the doctor about diabetes, or is it pretty unlikely that he'd have it without the frequent thirst and urination? I don't want to inquire if my coworkers are way off base.",
