            "answer": "In my twins book Rachie it mentions Keytones being harmful to the baby and this is the reason that as a twin mommy you must make sure you eat plenty to get your weight up. So I would guess that you are using up all of your carbohydrates. It's okay to break down fats because that's what they are there for but you sound like you are using up your fat stores. I would try and eat more....have you put on much weight?? Are you loosing wieght?",

    "question": "So I have been having an uncomfortable pinching in my lower abominal area for a few days and was worried i was getting a UTI...went to the OB and they did a urine culture, the results are not back yet but they did say that there were no while blood cells so it didn't appear to be a uti, but that there were ketones present.\u00a0\u00a0I asked what that ment and they said that ketones usually mean a kidney problem....I was wondering if anyone knows anything about this and what might be going on.\u00a0\u00a0I also read that ketones present with sugar means Gestational Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor checked me for that at 16 weeks and it was negative and was going to check me again next Wednesday ( 24weeks) again.",
