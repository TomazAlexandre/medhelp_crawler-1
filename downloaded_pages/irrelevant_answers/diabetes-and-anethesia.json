            "answer": "Hi, I've been diabetic for 44 yrs. since I was 17 months old. The times that I've taken general anesthesia I have slept for about 4\u00a0\u00a0days. Seems like my body has a hard time getting rid of the medicine. My sugars have been high even when I have barely eaten. Usually, my parents or my husband wake me up every 3 hours or so to check my sugar.Make sure the dentist knows you're diabetic in case you bleed more than normal. Good luck.",

            "answer": "I've had my appendix out and was under. Trust me you will be fine. Just check your sugar about 2 hours before you go in. If you feel more comfortable, have your sugar be a little higher. Let your anestesiaologist and your dentist know your concerns and let them know you are diabetic.",
