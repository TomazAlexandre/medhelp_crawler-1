            "answer": "Hello LoopyMo,We're all volunteers here and not medical professionals, so you may want to talk with a certified diabetes educator or endocrinologist for more insights.Your boyfriend's choices sound unusual, and yet we cannot assess \"how well\" we are doing just looking at what we eat (or don't eat.\u00a0\u00a0He is correct that we need to check often during the day and also to make adjustments for our food, activity, health, stress, etc.From your msg, I cannot tell if the measurements he makes reveal that he is balancing everything well or not.\u00a0\u00a0Typically, a Type 1 will have a lab blood test done every 3-4 months.\u00a0\u00a0It is called an a1c or hemoglobin a1c.\u00a0\u00a0It gives us a single number that indicates a rough average of our blood sugar every minute of every hour of the past 3-4 months.\u00a0\u00a0Because it is an average, of course, folks could have the same a1c result with very different blood sugars.Current recommendation is for us to keep our a1c below 7, to minimize risks of complications and balance risks of dangerous lows.I've provided you with basic diabetes management information.\u00a0\u00a0Your concerns for your BF seem rooted in compassion and we all benefit from compassion.You're obvioulsy a bright person, because you're skeptical of the flippant responses you're getting from your BF.\u00a0\u00a0That you are unsure that he's telling you the truth about this, however, is important information for you, too.\u00a0\u00a0It could be that he doesn't *want* you to know more; he might hear enuf voices \"telling him what to do\" in his own head, from his family, from his doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is a chronic 24*7 disease that we all must manage as best we can.\u00a0\u00a0Some days/weeks/months are easier than others, and yet we must move thru each of them.\u00a0\u00a0We may all experience bouts of denial.Ask him about his a1c and the direction they're going in the 1.5 years you've been together.\u00a0\u00a0Ask him how you can be supportive and helpful without triggering negative responses.\u00a0\u00a0If he's emotionally healthy, he'll know what you're asking and will likely see it as a refreshing approach.\u00a0\u00a0He'll be able to tell you his diabetic \"hot buttons\" (we all have 'em when well-meaning folks try to be helpful in just the wrong way ;-)\u00a0\u00a0)If he pushes you away from knowing about his particulars, I'd encourage you to move on in your life.\u00a0\u00a0Things will *not* get better.\u00a0\u00a0The risks *will* increase.\u00a0\u00a0Truth is ... he is in the driver's seat here and if he's unwilling to get your help navigating, that's important information for you, a young woman with your whole life ahead of you.Hope this helps, even tho' I may have taken a different direction than you were hoping for.",

            "answer": "Hi LoopyMo,I am a volunteer as well and a diabetic for 25 years.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with LRS-she had some good info. I have to tell you some of my own insights too.\u00a0\u00a0I love that my husband doesn't nag me about my diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He lets me handle it and doesn't questions everything that goes into my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is great that you are concerned, but don't push too hard.\u00a0\u00a0Instead get informed as LRS mentioned too.\u00a0\u00a0Look up info on websites, not commercial but more like JDRF.org\u00a0\u00a0When you are an informed person you might understand him and his habits better.\u00a0\u00a0Communication is good, so try it, but let him know you are not judging just concerned and trying to understand.",

    "question": "I am 22 years old and have been dating a 24 year old type 1 diabetic for the past year and a half.\u00a0\u00a0He's had diabetes from the age of 7. He eats alot of sugary foods, including ice cream and cookies and cake without discretion.\u00a0\u00a0He'll eat a big bowl of honey bunches of oats in the morning, have a sandwich or pizza for lunch, pasta for dinner and usually have a dessert, like a giant bowl of ice cream or popsicles, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He checks his blood sugar about 5-6 times a day and will wake up in the middle of the\u00a0\u00a0night to check it if he's having problems regulating it.\u00a0\u00a0He says he can eat whatever he wants as long as he checks his blood sugar and figures in the extra sugar when he takes his insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true?\u00a0\u00a0It drives me nuts because he knows alot about the disease and the biology of it, but i don't, so i never know if what he's doing is okay or not. I suggest sugarfree desserts, but he hates the whole idea of them. The taste, the aftertaste and deprivation annoy him.\u00a0\u00a0Help! Can he eat sweets? Or is he headed for disaster? I'm really scared for his future, i don't want him to have complications later in life because he's splurging now.",
