            "answer": "Hi!There are a couple of potential problems that could\u00a0\u00a0cause similar symptoms.Yeast\u00a0\u00a0is probably the most common.If you were my patient, I would probably do a biopsy though, as your symptoms sound somewhat suspicious for lichen sclerosis, or eczema.\u00a0\u00a0These conditions usually respond well to topical steriod creams.Sometimes the dark pigmentation can be a sign of elevated insulin levels, so I would probably also check for diabetes with a fasting blood sugar.Finally, if you are old enough to be close to menopause, hormone therapy might help.Good luck!Dr B",

    "question": "Hi....The outer sides of my vagina (more one side) is red raw and uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried using Calomine lotion and more recently Sigmacort cream but these have offered no relief.\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe I have thrush as the area is not itchy just sore and I have no type of discharge.\u00a0\u00a0The top inner sides of my legs have also over the past few months been sore and the skin has a developed a darker pigment now, like a birth mark on each side of the top of my legs below my vagina and towards my bottom.\u00a0\u00a0It is uncomfortable to have sex and my husband can't touch me in this area as parts are sore to the touch.\u00a0\u00a0I have also noticed that just inside the very top of the lips of the vagina is uncomfortable to touch, I notice this when I got to toilet or during sex/foreplay",
