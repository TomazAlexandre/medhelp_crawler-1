            "answer": "Hello Tonya,We're volunteers here & not medical professionals, so incorporate what you read here & other places into your conversations with the doctor.I hear your pain & fear that your husband is simply going to follow in his father's footsteps.\u00a0\u00a0Often an adult who is dx'd with diabetes goes thru a lengthy period of denial.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes their fears are strong it is paralyzing.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the journey seems so hard, they give up.\u00a0\u00a0Many adults simply \"push back\" almost like a child when we are told we MUST make difficult changes.Your husband is not ignorant of the dangers he faces.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is that he is terrified and fears that he is incapable of making the adjustments to be healthy.\u00a0\u00a0A healthy way of eating for a diabetic includes a balance of carbohydrates, protein, and fats.\u00a0\u00a0Potatoes and bread are examples of carbohydrates and they certainly CAN be included in a health diet.The issue is often one of quantity and preparation.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend that you find a Certified Diabetes Educator (CDE) or an experienced nutritionaist to work with you & your husband since there are many factors that contribute to a health diet for each individual.\u00a0\u00a0SUrely, one goal will be for your hubby to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0If others in the family need to lose weight, too, now's the time to help each other.Since arguing with him hasn't been an effective technique to motivate your hubby, and since seeing a close relative die of complications hasn't been effective either, which is why I think he's paralyzed with fear or anger that leads to eating (an unfortunate comfort for him, apparently).\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to talk to him and his doctor about the EMOTIONAL pain of diabetes and see how you can find help for him on that level.\u00a0\u00a0It takes emotional strength to manage a 24*7, no vacation, high stress disease like diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Few medical doctors tune into this important aspect of diabetes management, unless we patients bring it up.Some folks can get motivated by finding another individual who is going thru the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0Hearing from a skinny nutritionist that it's important to maintain a healthy weight can fall on deaf ears.\u00a0\u00a0Visit your local chapter of American Diabetes Association (an organization that has many resources for Type 2s) or their website http://www.diabetes.org\u00a0\u00a0YOu'll find not only food tips, but plenty of support...Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0This is a very difficult situation.",
