I got up to 235 at one point, then a counselor figured out I had a thyroid problem and had me tested. I felt horrible and had never been big and hated it and my docs at the time just kept saying it was depression.",

            "answer": "This all started either before, during or after pregnancy. I birthed a preemie six years ago, and my health went down from there. Doctors blamed my depression on my weight gain. My weight gain on my napping. My constipation on my anxiety, etc...I was seeing Gastros for three years for IBS, etc. After being misdiagnosed with shingles (Hashi rashes) then parathyroid disease (Hashi caused the low D which caused the PTH to elevate), which finally led me to an endo. He said there was nothing wrong with me, so I went to a new endo. She found a multi-nodular goiter, but continued to test my parathyroid levels for four months, ignoring my high end TSH done by the other endo. SHE DID NOT RUN ANY THYROID TESTS!!!I found this wonderful forum last summer and was told which tests to ask for. Elevated TPOab and frees below range confirmed Hashi. It has been quite a ride!:) Tamra",

I was 5'2 88lbs, so it was very noticeable.I was treated for depression for six months (I was a new mommy at the time-post partum depressin), until one day saw a different doctor for my swelled neck that he made me stick my hands out, they were shaking uncontrollabley. All history from there. I did hit two thyroid storms due to not being treated properly. But I will let by gones be by gones..",
