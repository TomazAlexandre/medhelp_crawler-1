            "answer": "Hi!It is a tough situation to be in. Taking steroids may control your hairloss but is likely to worsen diabetes, cause lowering of bone mineral density and increase in weight. Apart from setroids,\u00a0\u00a0immunomodulatory drugs such as imiquimod can be tried, but they increase the risk of infection especially since you also have diabetes. What is important is that since the hair follicles do not die in this disorder, the hair will eventually grow back. You need to discuss this with your doctor to strike a balance between the two autoimmune disorders you have. Take care!",
