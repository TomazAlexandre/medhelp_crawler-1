            "answer": "Oh yeah--its totally normal to just ache all over and have no energy---especially with two other little ones. Pregnancy does a number on us--it loosens all our joints, and all that pressure from the growing uterus and extra weight just makes us ache and hurt.You WILL feel better after the birth, but you still have a ways to go. I think you should just not worry if you can't do everything you used to. I too am normally a \"do everything\" mom, but I have just accepted that I am NOT going to be able to be like that right now. (I am 19 weeks along)We eat out more, my house isn't perfectly clean, and that is FINE!!! Try not to worry about it. Take the attitude that you DESERVE to take it as easy as you need to-----you are growing a PERSON!!! :)The world won't fall apart if you don't do eveything you used to be able to do.Wishing you the best!!!!:)",
