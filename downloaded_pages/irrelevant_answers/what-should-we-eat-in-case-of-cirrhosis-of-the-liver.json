            "answer": "Whether someone with cirrhosis needs to change their diet depends upon how advanced their cirrhosis is. The main thing a person needs to do is to stay away from anything that is toxic to the liver that can cause further liver damage. This would include alcohol, certain over the counter and prescription drugs, certain vitamins and supplements etc.Someone who has been diabetic for 17 years already has dietary issues that they must manage along with any changes that must be make because of cirrhosis.The best source of information would be the patient's hepatologist or gastroenterologist as only they would know the complete health picture of a patient with both diabetes and cirrhosis.So have her talk to the doctor that is managing her cirrhosis. They may refer her to a dietician to help her with diet.Good luck.Hector",
