            "answer": "You obviously are having a problem, and it doesn't sound like your doctor has been giving you much information. She said you \"have low blood sugar\". That is not a condition so much as a symptom. Did she say \"reactive hypoglycemia\" did she say diabetes or pre-diabetes. And what did she tell you to do about it? It sounds to me like you need a more complete work-up and than information as to what you have and how to treat it. I would suggest asking more questions of this doctor or finding another one who will give you some answer. Ketones are a symptom of something called DKA which is a symptom of out-of-control diabetes and is quite serious. I am not diagnosing you over the internet; nobody can do that. But you need to find out what is going on and learn how to deal with it. Going without eating or drinking lots of sugary drinks is only going to make things worse.",

            "answer": "Depression can lead to many physical symptoms and should be treated with a combination of counseling and medication. I'm assuming your doctor ruled out any other physical explanations for your problems. You need to be sure to tell doctors everything you are experiencing and ask questions as to what they have concluded.",

    "question": "Okay, back in early December I got really dehydrated and had to go to the hospital. They did some blood work on me and said that I had some ketones in my blood. This disturbed me. I was really sick and I didn't eat anything for a week. I couldn't get out of bed and I felt really tired and weak. I threw up sometimes, but not as much as I used to when I got dehydrated in the past. Eventually I got better, but I noticed I felt more tired, dizzy, weak, and faint. I drink more then i'm supposed to also. One time I drank 8 capri suns in a row. I didn't feel sick either. I also noticed that I urinate more than usual too. Well anyway, I went to the doctor yesterday for stomach pain, and she said that I had low blood sugar. The weird thing about it is, is that all the blood work results have been negative. But I know I have a problem, because I don't have any energy like normal teens my age. I'm a lot more irritable and moody, and I have emotional problems. I throw fits for no reason and I throw things. Another thing that has been going on is my diet. I don't eat as much as I should. I go without eating for a couple of hours, and I don't eat until the evening or nighttime. I usually eat one meal a day. I know that's not healthy, but I never have an appetite. I just don't get hungry! I don't think I have anorexia. I'm not scared of being fat. Before I got dehydrated, I used to have a healthy appetite, but after that, my appetite disappeared. Another think i've been noticing, is that every morning I wake up, i'm extremely nauseous and sick. My heat races and I feel like i'm going to faint. I even feel anxious for no reason! This lasts from 7:00 in the morning to 9:30 in the morning.I am 16 years old, 5 feet 3\" and weigh 98 ibs.",
