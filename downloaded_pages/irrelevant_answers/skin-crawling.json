            "answer": "Hello,Such symptoms of skin crawling are called parasthesia. They are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hello, I have heard that \" Crawley\" Skin has something to do with \" Nerve damage. Then. I hear it's something to do with my diabetes. All I know my docter gave me, \" Gabapentin. But this medication is to strong for me. But it works even though it's generic. So\"? Does this Crawley sensation, cause your \" Fybroids to act up\"? Because I've read other peoples reviews and I see this symptom is also a symptom for Crawley skin, sharp pain, itchy skin, and when night time comes. It gets worst. But this is what I'm taking for it. Thank you for letting me share this comment. :-) :-) :-) :-) .",
