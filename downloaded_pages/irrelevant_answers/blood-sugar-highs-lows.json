            "answer": "another test for diabetes is having a BG over 200 (IF you meter is correct)\u00a0\u00a0Make SURE you wash your hands before testing.\u00a0\u00a0 It is normal to have a normal A1c and be diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0How?\u00a0\u00a0The A1c is the last thing to show a problem.\u00a0\u00a0The A1c measures the average BG,\u00a0\u00a0Having high BG 200 and low BG 56 can average out to a normal A1c.There is another test for diabetes its called the OGTT (Oral Glucose Tolerances Test)BG over 200 is diabetesFind out if your local hospital has a diabetes department, go in tell them your symptoms and meter readings and see if they will give you an OGTT.You are doing great.\u00a0\u00a0A meter is a good start.\u00a0\u00a0We do know that carbohydrates (carbs) are what raise BG BG\u00a0\u00a0ALL carbs raise BG bread, pasta, rice, most fruit.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us control our diabetes by restricting our carbs so that one hour after eating our BG does not go over 140.You could be a LADA diabetic (Late Onset type 1)\u00a0\u00a0they often have wildly fluctuating BG as the Beta cells (they make the insulin) get killed off)There is an antibody test for that too.\u00a0\u00a0GAD testDiabetes is not the end it is controllable, the horror stories you hear are from NOT controlling your BG.\u00a0\u00a0\"Normal BG is the cause of absolutely nothing\"\u00a0\u00a0 Diabetics can have normal BG",

            "answer": "Thanks for the response.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting BG has never been over 200.\u00a0\u00a0That is my post-meal reading.\u00a0\u00a0Interestingly, I had an OGTT test.\u00a0\u00a0I expected the test would show my readings to be very high; instead it showed that I dropped to mid-30's during the test.\u00a0\u00a0They repeated the test (on the same sample and got same reading).\u00a0\u00a0That was my one-hour reading.\u00a0\u00a0My two-hour reading was in the 40's (and again it was repeated on same sample with same results).\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said to discard the results because they couldn't be accurate (and I had to agree because from things I've read, I should have been comatose with a level like that, right?)\u00a0\u00a0 I will see if doc will order the GAD test; I've never heard of that.\u00a0\u00a0I must say though that my doctor feels like I'm chasing a problem that doesn't exist.\u00a0\u00a0He may not allow the GAD test.Thanks again for the response.",

            "answer": "Yes a post meal over 200 is diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0if your fasting was over 200 you should be on insulin.The OGTT test 40 at 1 hour is low and no for most people 40 will not make you comatose Ive been at 35 and functioning.\u00a0\u00a0But 40 sound like you have Reactive Hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0your pancreas over shoots making insulin and your BG goes too low.As I said if your meter is accurate and your fingers clean 200 is not a good number nor is 40 so id say you got something going on.there are continuous BG monitors,\u00a0\u00a0the MD put it on you and it monitors your BG for 3 days and stores the data.\u00a0\u00a0You return it to the MD and they can see exactly what your BG is doing every 5 minutes.Id suggests you see an endocrinologist they would be more up to date (I hope)I am NOT an MD,\u00a0\u00a0just a well controlled diabetic for 30+ years",

            "answer": "You've definitely got something going on that's not normal.Agree with Diabetes86 comments above.\u00a0\u00a0Best to see an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Also bring the results of the OGTT.\u00a0\u00a0It does sound like reactive hypoglycemia, which is often an early sign of diabetes - and the 200 post eating is too high.Fasting between 100 - 127 is also not normal.\u00a0\u00a0fasting of > 126 will get you diagnosed as diabetic.I would suggest that you adopt a low carb, high healthy fat diet, with moderate protein.\u00a0\u00a0 The idea is to reduce the stress on your pancreas so that it can cope with the day to day demands.\u00a0\u00a0Carbs will drive the roller coaster of highs and lows.I also believe you should get in to see an endocrinologist, and be tested for adult onset type 1 diabetes (however, not all tests come up +ve - ie. can be false negative).",

            "answer": "Further to my previous post - I think you are having ongoing immune attack on your pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0This may be cyclical, which is why some weeks you have constant highs, and then for other weeks (assuming the attack has reduced) you are having lows.You could also look at paleo diet autoimmune protocol if it is something you are interested in... the idea is to adopt a diet that will help to calm inflammation... avoid processed foods, chemicals, eat a very clean diet.",

    "question": "I don't like the doctor's answers (or rather non-answers) so I'm going to come to the real experts:\u00a0\u00a0those of you that live with this every day.\u00a0\u00a0:)About a year ago I began having symptoms of diabetes (excessive urination and thirst).\u00a0\u00a0There is no history of diabetes in my family and I'm not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 54 years old.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor tested my a1C, it was a 5.2.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor said that was perfect, no diabetes, go home.Within a few months I began having dizzy spells on many mornings.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor said I wasn't staying hydrated, drink more water, go home.My own research indicated to me that these two things might be related.\u00a0\u00a0I bought a home glucose monitor.\u00a0\u00a0Here is what I have noticed and I cannot find anything in my own research to help me interpret.For a few weeks my fasting blood sugar will be between 100-127.\u00a0\u00a0My spikes after meals will go over 200.\u00a0\u00a0It takes about four hours after a meal for me to return to my pre-meal state of 100-127.Then, suddenly, my fasting levels will be 56-72 each morning.\u00a0\u00a0No matter what I eat my blood sugar will remain under a hundred and then quickly drop back down to the 56-72 range.\u00a0\u00a0This will last a couple of weeks before I return to the high levels again.I tell the doctor, but doctor doesn't look at my meter.\u00a0\u00a0He runs another a1c.\u00a0\u00a0This time it is 5.4.\u00a0\u00a0Normal he says.\u00a0\u00a0Go home.Can one of you explain to me what is happening?\u00a0\u00a0Many thanks in advance.Deborah",
