When I started on meds I started on a combination of Metformin and a couple others and I do remember seeing results fairly quickly (maybe a week)\u00a0\u00a0I do have questions as to whether you are testing your blood sugar on a regular basis and modifying your diet based on the results you see. You sound like you have a lot on your plate; best of luck to you!",

            "answer": "\"I'm wondering how long before I start seeing lower glucose levels.\"That's too hard to answer. Metformin helps to lower your glucose by producing some insulin in the gut but it really depends on your lifestyle, your nutrition, your activity. Ignore one and you decrease the chance of Metformin helping you.I drafted this document the other day and you will be the first.There are over 21 million American adults and children who suffer from diabetes type 2 and the number is growing rapidly each day. The typical diet high in sugar and processed foods only adds fatigue, creates cardio issues, and raises glucose levels which in turn brings about diabetes.Here are some tips to help control and lower your glucose:1.\tCut out sugar and processed foods. It\u2019s the most important and hardest thing to do. Eat more fruits and veggies instead. Skip desert, period. Stop munching. Its not too late start eating better.2.\tEat a better breakfast. Your metabolism is faster in the morning than it is later in the day. Skip the man made dry cereals for they are loaded with sugar. Instead of doughnuts, eat foods high in fiber, protein and good fats, like a veggie omelet, or oatmeal with \u00bc tsp cinnamon and handful of blueberries for the antioxidant compounds.3.\tLearn to love your veggies. Although it\u2019s contrary to many American meals, eat a main course of veggies with a small side of meat to provide the right nutritional balance.Moderate exercise:1.\tGo for a walk after eating to help burn off excess glucose.2.\tDo some sort of moderate exercise daily or at least 3-5 times a week.Weight:1.\tYou\u2019d be surprised how much lower your glucose will be if you shed those EXTRA pounds.It\u2019s all up to you to start practicing a better lifestyle control to improve and maintain good health. If you enjoy being sick and miserable, ignore this post completely.",

The oncologist thinks that my high TSH maybe a factor in my having diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have started an exercise routine trying slowly to get back to where I use to do, 30-40 minutes on a threadmill or stationary bike.\u00a0\u00a0I have also modified my diet and have taken all sugars off and increase vegetables (cooked and raw).\u00a0\u00a0I started doing this right after I got my diagnosis. Also according to my weight this morning I have lost 2 lbs in one week.\u00a0\u00a0Last night before dinner my glucose level was 526 mg/dl, the morning before breakfast it was 228 mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0I take two reading a day, before breakfast and before dinner.\u00a0\u00a0I have oatmeal for breakfast and I j recently read that cinnamon helps reduce the glucose level.",

            "answer": "Start monitoring what you eat. Don't munch on bad things between meals too. That last before dinner 526 mg/dl reading is dangerous and can and will lead to electrolyte imbalance. Congrats on tackling diabetes head on for you're on the right path. But, again, watch the foods. Even foods that contain little or no sugar may jack up your glucose. That is why its important to monitor what you eat, when you eat, and how much you eat and then eliminate and/or reduce your intake of those foods so it doesn't wreck havoc on your body. Start a log/diary of some sorts. This is what I did until I knew which foods to avoid.Good luck.",
