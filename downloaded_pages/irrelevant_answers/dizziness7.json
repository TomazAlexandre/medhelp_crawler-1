            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are many causes of dizziness, lightheadedness, passing out, blackouts etc. It is difficult to comment without examination. I am just enumerating the possible causes. You can discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Dizziness could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis or compression of cervical spinal nerves. All these cause dizziness when you get up from lying down position or when you change position that results in a change in the level of your head. Cervical spondylitis and ear problems also cause dizziness on changing the position of the neck. Certain types of epilepsies and seizures too can cause similar symptoms. If you have an accompanying headache then you must also look at benign intracranial hypertension. It could also be a case of transient ischemic attacks or TIA.Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling.In your case even if your hemoglobin level is normal, you should get serum iron also measured. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!",

    "question": "hi,im a 20 year old female i've always suffered from anemia just not severe probably cause im a thallassemia carrier, last time i checked my hemoglobin was 11 which i guess is not bad. i get these blackouts every time i get up, and lately its gotten worse like 6 times a day, when i stand i become dizzy and my sight blacksout and i get a feeling of numbness all over my body for a few seconds. ive went to a dr several years ago and he said i have vitamin deficiency and gave me a multi vitamin but i stopped it after a month since i haven't seen any change. so i was wondering is this related to my Anemia issue? and is there something i can do about it?",
