            "answer": "Hello,Since there is still burning while urinating when you had a recent bladder infection, it can be due to recurrent urinary tract infection. Recurrent urine infections could be due to various reasons. Most common cause is stones in kidney which is blocking urine pathway. Other causes are incomplete antibiotic treatment which is not sensitive to the infection, changing sexual partners frequently, pregnancy, diabetes and of course childhood infections. The urine can also be due to retention of urine anywhere in its flow due t obstruction. The obstruction can be due to abnormality of structures since birth, stones or diseases like tumors.Females are more prone to urine infections. So you should get a ultrasound, CT scan done and also some urine and blood tests. Avoid taking pain pills. Drink about 2-3 liters of water in a day.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
