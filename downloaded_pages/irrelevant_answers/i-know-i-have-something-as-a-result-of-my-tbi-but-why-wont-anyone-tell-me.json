            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Common causes like overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, hypothyroidism (this ruled out) have to be ruled out in your case. You must then look for other causes. One is water retention due to low serum protein. This along with anemia can cause unexplained weight gain. Adrenal gland problems are the other cause. Cushing\u2019s syndrome should be looked for. The kidney function too should be assessed. Late night snacking and poor sleep too can cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain.Please consult your PCP to rule out these causes one by one. Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "I do not overeat and I love to exercise, have trained for and ran 5 half marathons.\u00a0\u00a0So that I inherited the bunion from my Mom and haven't been running and have experienced more symptoms of hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0It is not ruled out, I was in a car accident and suffered a severe traumatic brain injury and my weight gain started 2 years after my accident and running my half marathon would not let me loose more than 10 pounds and now since I am not running, I swim though, I have gained 20 pounds well this morning on the scale 10 lbs but still.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on an antidepressant since 1997 and I have also been on bipolar medicine even though I'm not bipolar just brain injured.Hypothyroidism is definitely not ruled out by a long shot.\u00a0\u00a0I have all the symptoms and I read a book by a doctor, Dr. Stark who had hypothyroidism and he said doctors need to look at the symptoms before they rule out hypothyroidism because of blood.\u00a0\u00a0I read another book titled:\u00a0\u00a0Why do I still have symptoms when my blood tests are normal?I sleep more now than I ever have.\u00a0\u00a0A side effect of hypothyroidism is excessive thirst and I have the excessive thirst and I do not have diabetes.Thanks for trying but my PCP has tried and he referred me to an endocronologist who I am trying to convince and hopefully she did enough research to find out that hypothyroidism is common after severe TBI.Thanks but it is not that simple if you factor in everything.",
