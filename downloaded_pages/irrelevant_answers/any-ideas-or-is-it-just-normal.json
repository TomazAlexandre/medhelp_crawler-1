I do have more of a risk with this pregnancy because I had it with my first pregnancy and this is my first pregnancy with my partner. I just don't know if it's normal or not. I just put a call in to a nurse. This headache has been bad. Not normal for me, but could be just a normal pregnancy complaint. I just don't know. I've had some swelling, but nothing too bad. I guess it wouldn't hurt to have them check my urine for protein and sugar to rule both out. I'm just feeling like such a complainer!",

Gestational diabetes left untreated can also cause the baby to be born with diabetes as well. It's just over all not good. Please talk to your doctor.",

    "question": "Okay, in the past three days I have had quite a severe throbbing headache, despite drinking lots of water and taking Tylenol. Neither helps. Not only that, despite drinking lots of water, I still have excessive thirst. Can't get enough. Frequent urination also, which I guess makes sense with late pregnancy. I have had an aching in my mid back right where I know my right kidney is, but yet a urine specimen done just monday came back negative. It is a throbbing. So:Severe headacheExcessive thirstFrequent urinationFlank painAny ideas? Or does this just seem normal? It doesn't feel normal. But I have been such a whiner lately to my doctor about my discomforts with sore ribs and basic discomforts, I thought I would ask here first. I can't get rid of this headache and I can't seem to drink enough water to quench my thirst.",
