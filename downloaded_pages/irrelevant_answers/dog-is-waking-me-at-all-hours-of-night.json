            "answer": "Have you considered that this may be a health issue?Her need to go out all through the night, and her excessive panting sounds, to me, like she has a problem. She could have a urinary problem, for instance, and her panting could be a sign her temperature is up a bit.When she goes out, does she do pee, or business?It might be worth taking her to be checked at the vet's. And try if you can, to take a urine sample with you.If health checks come up clean, then it is likely to be a behavior problem. But one thing at a time. Get her health checked first.",

            "answer": "Thanks Ginger,I'll try to get a sample and bring her in.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's more behavioural only because when I'm home all day, she doesn't ask to go out much, nor does she pant.\u00a0\u00a0So it seems like she's looking for attention during the night and when I get home, after that, she's calm, quiet and no problem.\u00a0\u00a0But I'll have her checked out anyway.\u00a0\u00a0She has an appointment in a week so I'll let you know.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",

            "answer": "I would have the vet give her a good going over.\u00a0\u00a0When they start drinking large quantities of water it can be indicative of diabetes, and with her being an older dog, her chances of having something wrong with her health and not just having it be a psychological thing because of the change in living arrangements are increased.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever it is, I don't think it's just because she's in a strange situation, so my advice would be to have a vet check her out and do some bloodwork to make sure everything is OK there, and then base your next move on what the vet says.Ghilly",

            "answer": "It IS the best idea to have her health checked, just to be on the safe side. It is always a good idea to have a Senior Health Check say, every year, or even every 6-9 months with any dog over the age of 8-9. Just as routine. It costs a bit, but not TOO much, and most people can afford to do this, considering if a health problem IS found during one of these routine checks, the vet will have a head-start in treating it, rather than waiting for symptoms to show up.But like you say, it is rather mysterious that she shows none of these symptoms during the day.",

            "answer": "I've been thinking about this, and I'm wondering if there could maybe be problems with her vision or even just the naturally occurring aging process causing a bit of canine dementia?\u00a0\u00a0If she has cataracts, it could make it difficult for her to see in low light, and this could be stressing her and making her anxious, leading to the other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Canine dementia can also cause them to do strange things that they've never done before, and while you were in your own home, she was in her comfortable routine and it wasn't a problem.\u00a0\u00a0But now that you're in the temporary situation of staying with friends, she finds herself in unfamiliar surroundings and it is confusing to her and causing her to act oddly.Maybe you could try setting up a bed for her alongside your own bed, and put a worn T-shirt or something else that smells like you in her bed so that she thinks she's closer to you than she actually is.\u00a0\u00a0This way, it will free up the bed for when your mate comes to stay, but your dog will think she's sleeping in the bed with you, especially if you put her little bed right down on the floor underneath you, this way if she starts to move around or it seems like she's going to get fussy, you can just drop your arm over the side of the bed and pet her to calm her down.I would still have her checked out for diabetes, though, since a sudden increase in water consumption is one of the main indicators of the disease.Ghilly",
