            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but urge of frequent urination can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism and diuretic drugs.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography ,prostate specific antigen blood test,thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and God bless.",

            "answer": "I am a female 52 yrs of age.\u00a0\u00a0I too feel the frequent urge to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0Not so much when I am at home relaxing.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I am in a public place,\u00a0\u00a0I will have to go.\u00a0\u00a0When I do empty my bladder, within a short time I feel like I have to go again.\u00a0\u00a0This is not a urinary tract infection.\u00a0\u00a0I have had those before.\u00a0\u00a0I don't even really have alot of urine sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to pinpoint what makes it worse. Caffeine, alcohol and sexual intercourse seem to trigger it.\u00a0\u00a0I am convinced that generally speaking, I have a sensitive system.\u00a0\u00a0I have an irritation of my stomach and esophagus, hot and spicy foods burn my throat and mouth, so I have sort of concluded that\u00a0\u00a0other parts of my body may be equally prone to irritation.\u00a0\u00a0There is some testing you can have done to see if your bladder empties properly etc.\u00a0\u00a0I was ready to have this done but canceled for now.\u00a0\u00a0Was going to try to drink less coffee, tea.\u00a0\u00a0What the Dr has suggested is all good but I noticed you have seen a urologist about this problem.\u00a0\u00a0Were any tests performed to make him conclude you are just a nervous person?\u00a0\u00a0Nerves can be a trigger or make things worse but may not be the cause. Do you pee alot when you go? or are you just getting the urge.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot for the life of me think what these tests are called right now and I even had the brochure from my gynocologists office explaining what it was all about.\u00a0\u00a0At least it can rule out certain things like bladder weakness and so forth.\u00a0\u00a0This sounds weird but they monitor your pelvic floor muscles when you pee among other things.\u00a0\u00a0It is on the internet but I just can't think what you call it.\u00a0\u00a0Something like urodynamics or..........can't think of it.\u00a0\u00a0I am getting close to going to a urologist or getting the testing just so I can rule out weak muscles etc.\u00a0\u00a0As far a diabetes or other diseases being the cause....I get a physical every year so I get screening for many things and everything is good.\u00a0\u00a0Do other members of your family pee alot?\u00a0\u00a0This runs in my family also.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck.",

    "question": "I am a twenty year old female. I started having to constantly urinate when I started college - had to withdraw because of it. When I tell this to people, they look at me like I'm crazy. I'm not. I noticed that before this became a full blown problem, I would have a strong urge to urinate when I was in situations that made me nervous. Then it became that I had a strong urge to urinate all the time - nervous or not. I can't go on long car rides, don't like to meet new people or go to new places, i'm putting my education on hold all because of this and it's frustrating. I went to many doctors that told me it wasn't a medical problem. I finally went to see a urologist and he told me it's because I'm a nervous person and then prescribed me toviaz (too expensive, can't afford it). If this is all in my head, how do I change it????????This discussion is related to/posts/show/226092.",
