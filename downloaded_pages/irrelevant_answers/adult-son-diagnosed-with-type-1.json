    "question": "I don't understand how after 26 years, my son can have type one diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He goes to the doctor, take daily injections, but he is always so hungry.\u00a0\u00a0He lives with us, and really, he eats for a family!\u00a0\u00a0And he still is relatively thin. He is almost 6'5\", and weighs about 190.\u00a0\u00a0I worry, and there must be something he can do, to feel satisfied.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone suggest something?",
