            "answer": "Hello,I am very sorry for your loss. ESWL can be done in two days consecutively but it can cause subcapsular and the retroperitoneal haematomas. One case was reported, in whom a life-threatening retro-peritoneal haematoma appeared when half an hour after ESWL, an intravenous anticoagulation was started due to an acute myocardial infarction. In another case, acute renal failure resulted after ESWL.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
