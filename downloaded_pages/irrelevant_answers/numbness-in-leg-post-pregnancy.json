            "answer": "Hi,How is your wife feeling now? What is her name? What name you have kept for your son?Tingling and numbness is usually due to some peripheral nerve pathology. Signs of nerve dysfunction are pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness along the distribution of nerve.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your wife\u2019s case it appears to me as some generalized pathology or disturbance to nerve which is causing the symptoms.The doctor is right in starting VitB12 supplements shots and subsequently you would be put on daily maintenance doses.Have you checked her diabetic status?Enjoy yourself with your newly delivered happiness.Keep me informed about her disease progression and also if any concerns arise for your lil one.Bye.",

    "question": "My wife delivered a healthy baby boy 10 days ago and she had taken epidurals to reduce pain. However post pregnancy othe right leg did not lose numbness as the left one did. She is able to move the leg properly, is able to walk, however the right knee seems to be numb and can't hold her weight. She can walk but can't walk up or down the stairs or sit in a car without difficulty or fear of falling down. The MIR reports all came normal, with an exception of sedrate being very high, the neurologist after the blood test informed tht her vitamin B12 level of significantly low (as she is a vegetarian) and this could be the reason of the numbness. Though she is now taking the vitamin shots regularly as advised, the doctor is suggesting that the recover is now time dependent as there is no clear reason/cause of such numbness. Any help / references/ pointers are greatly appreciated.",
