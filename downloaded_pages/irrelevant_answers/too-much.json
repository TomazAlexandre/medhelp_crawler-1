            "answer": "Fortunately gabopenton is water soluble and excreted via your kidneys. Vicodon can have a hepatotoxic effect, but only in large dosages and your dosage is relatively low. However, lexipro is hard on the liver and has been known to cause hepatitis in large dosages.Also, diabetes can be related to various liver problems as well. So given your diabetes combined with the lexipro, you should talk to your doctor about having your liver panel blood testing done on a fairly regular basis. Maybe every month or so, just to monitor your liver enzymes and keep a close watch on things. If things were to start to show liver stress, your medication could easily be adjusted.",

            "answer": "Hi Zignut,Welcome to our\u00a0\u00a0Pain Management Community. Excuse my tardy respone. I'm sorry to hear about your \"sluggish\" feeling.Remar has offered some good suggestions.The medications you are taking alone can cause a sluggish feeling. A side effect of Lexapro is unusual tiredness or weakness and fatigue. It's also a questionable prescription for ppl with diabetes and liver disease. Your physician is the expert - not me or anyone here. We are just raising issues for you to consider or discuss with your medical provider(s).The liver is our bodies filter - so anything that may be harmful is filtered\u00a0\u00a0through that organ. Harmful properties cause wear and tear on the liver - but it's a tough organ (for most of us).Gabapentin (Neurontin) can cause fatigue, somnolence and dizziness. As Remar said Gabapentin is generally cleared by the renal system and rarely -\u00a0\u00a0if at all effects the liver.Vicodin (Hydrocodone) an opiate - can also cause some \"sluggish\" and sleepy-like symptoms, especially as it's effects begin to wear off.When you had Ambien to the mix of medications you are taking which has common side effects of sleepiness or unusual drowsiness - even after the initial effects - it's no wonder you are experiencing some \"sluggish\"\u00a0\u00a0feelings.Obviously it's a good idea to have some labs done, checking all systems including liver function, iron levels, etc -\u00a0\u00a0and a general work-up or physical to rule out all possibilities of any disease conditions. If everything is negative than take a look at your medications. Work with your physicians to determine if it would be advisable to have some of your meds changed, eliminated or reduced.Please let us know how you are doing. We always look forward to the updates or comments of our members or visitors to our community.Best of Luck and Take Care!~Tuck",
