            "answer": "hi bbthanks for responding.i am of the same opinion as you and was quite alarmed when they told me that needed to rush the appts through in order to get to the bottom of this as soon as possible, but it's been a week now since i saw the endocrinologist and no appt has arrived, so i am beginning to eliminate the possibility of anything really major going on.will let you know the outcome anyway.take carepip",

    "question": "hii am diabetic (type 2) hypertensive and on medication for both. i also have over-active thyroid. in feb liver function blood test came back with abnormal cells and i was referred to endocrinologist. since then i have had ultrasound and more+ bloods. i saw endocrinologist yesterday for results and learnt that my liver is enlarged with discreet lesion, my kidneys are slightly enlarged too. more bloods taken this a.m. and doc says he will change and add meds for diabetes blood pressure and thyroid when in receipt of bloods results and is referring me to gastroenterologist and liver specialist for further investigations. he tells me that they may want to do mri or ct scan, possibly an endoscopy and probably a biopsy. i know it's a process of elimination, but can anyone advise the best and worst scenario diagnosis to expect. i had hapatitis B 30 years ago (AA neg now), uncomfortable upper central/right abdo pain almost constantly recently, lost apetite, lost weight, tired, nauseaus, and sometimes v painful in upper centre abdo when swallowing. my family are worried silly and i would really like to reassure them that what i have is not necessarily a majer prob.thank you and look forward to hearing from you soon.pipPS please ignore my last post as i have added to it.\u00a0\u00a0thanks:)",
