            "answer": "You are not alone if you become pregnant while overweight! I was overweight for both pregnancies and both of my pregnancies were full-term with VAGINAL deliveries...and both babies were born healthy and I did NOT have gestational diabetes.The key to pregnancy when overweight is EXERCISE! Always check with your doctor to make sure he considers you healthy enough for pregnancy exercise, and avoid anything high-impact, but running, walking, swimming are ALL wonderful pregnancy exercises...also look into pregnancy yoga!the other key (hand in hand, really) is NUTRITION! eating a healthy, balanced diet and not letting cravings overwhelm your good sense is vital. You have to learn now more than ever to substitute healthy snacks for unhealthy ones; when you're hungry and pregnant, you HAVE to eat. the key is WHAT you eat :). Weight Watches is a wonderful idea, but you should generally not limit caloric (count) intake while pregnant; ask your OB to be sure what he thinks you should do but most women should NOT diet while pregnant....this is usually for women with glucose issues or serious weight gain issues.I didn't gain weight with either pregnancy because I was extra-vigilant, and in fact I lost a little weight with both pregnancies...so it's entirely possible to maintain a healthy weight if you work hard and pay attention.Please send a msg if you have any questions, and there is actually a User Group here on MedHelp designed for overweight women going/about to go through/gone through pregnancy while overweight, please drop by and tell your story!http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Pleasingly-Plump-to-Plus-Size-Pregnancies/show/862?camp=msc",

I follow weight watchers quite often and have been working to lose weight so provide my baby with the best life possible.My husband and I were going to wait until I got to a healthy weight (hopefully by next summer) to conceive, but I think I may be pregnant now.Does anyone have any advice about this? Any thoughts or insights would be appreciated.thank youRachel",
