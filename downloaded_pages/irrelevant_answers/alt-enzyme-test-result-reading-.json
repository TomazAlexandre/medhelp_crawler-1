            "answer": "Look into (NASH), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Your description of things fits that profile. NASH is an increasing problem with the increase in obesity in this country. The amount of adipose fat that you are carrying around inside your abdomen also produces toxins when it gets out of proportion to your body size and weight. Adipose tissue when it starts expelling these toxins sends them straight into your liver. This along with triglyceride and cholesterol abnormalities would raise ALT. Your best bet is to lose weight now and take that very seriously. NASH is progressive if not arrested.",

            "answer": "I think you should ask the doctor to check out your liver thoroughly and test you for Hepatitis C as well as for fatty liver. Hep C can cause insulin resistance and is causal for Diabetes II. You want to test for it and make sure to rule that out. The only way to know is with a blood test. Most people aren't aware that that virus can affect people who do NOT have any drug history where they could have picked it up, yet they have it. It is\u00a0\u00a0epidemic in the US.When your enzymes are high it's a good idea not to drink any alcohol if you happen to drink.Good thing you are getting that ultrasound and a fasting glucose test..",

    "question": "Yes, went to dr. with symptoms of a little fatique and just not feeling completely well, dr. said there were things going around, but took a blood sample, I did not fast before test..Test results came back with a blood/sugar reading of 110 and ALT Liver test reading of 95. My last physical approx 1-1/2 years ago showed ALT Liver enzymes at 45.\u00a0\u00a0I am an overweight male weighing 250lbs at 5-10\" although I have a somewhat muscular build, I am still overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I have no other symptoms that I can pinpoint, I do take blood pressure medicine along with a daily asprin.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I had been taking when needed some advil for sinus and slight congestion, but was really taking that everyday. I am worried about my liver, don't drink but on occassions.\u00a0\u00a0I also take a drug called Clonazepam that helps with some muscle dystonia that I have, but from what I've been told, none of the medicine or prescription drugs that I'm own should elevate liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0All other test results for the liver were good, only the ALT was high.\u00a0\u00a0Any Info or help would greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I am having an ultrasound done and have just had a diabetes 3 hr test which appears to be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Also, all hepatitis tests were negative.\u00a0\u00a0Why the high ALT reading I wonder.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
