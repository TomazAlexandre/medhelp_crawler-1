            "answer": "Several things:Acid reflux could be causing his breathing issues.\u00a0\u00a0I am not familiar with Pantaloc.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest he talk with his doctor about taking a proton pump inhibitor and an H2 blocker as well as life style changes to better control his reflux.\u00a0\u00a0Silent reflux can cause sinus drainage and the 'fur ball' feeling.Heart issues could still be at play.\u00a0\u00a0He should have a good talk with his cardiologist.Lastly allergies and asthma could be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0An exam by his primary care physician can rule those out or confirm them.Praying you find answers.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply.Pantoloc is a PPI and he is on H2 blockers as well. He will have a followup appointment with his cardiologist in 4-6 weeks.He does not have asthma according to his GP, although I personally think he\u00a0\u00a0has an allergy to milk.He is just frustrated at his seemingly neverending health issues and inability to sleep in his own bed at night and chronic fatigue and lack of enthusiasm for life and so am I. He is not the life-loving man he was even 4 months ago.I am starting to wonder if he is suffering from depression brought on by his ongoing health issues.",

            "answer": "He can add an anti-acid of calcium and magnesium (Tums Rolaids...) when he has break through symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0What H2 blocker is he on?Been there and done the depression thing.\u00a0\u00a0It is very common for people dealing with chronic health issues.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it really feels like they are controlling you.\u00a0\u00a0For me it was that I was losing my ability to go anywhere or care for my family without having asthma attacks.\u00a0\u00a0Simple things like cooking a meal would trigger attacks.\u00a0\u00a0It is very hard and frustrating.Praying that you find some answers soon.",

    "question": "My husband has several medical problems including diabetes and has recently has two stents placed.In Feb 2010 he had a heart attack and was recovering fairly well from that, but over the summer his health started to deteriorate and he ended up in hospital and eventually had 2 stents placed.Over the past 6-8 months he has had increasing problems with his nose constantly running (clear discharge), frequent throat clearing, has what he calls a \"furball\" in his throat that he can't get rid of, and has difficulty breathing. When you watch him breathe his entire abdomen heaves with each breath he takes. His nasal discharge increases drastically every time he eats, especially when eating soup.He has been on Pantaloc for about 4 years as he suffers from chronic heartburn, as well as several other medications to control cholesterol and diabetes.Since he has had his stent placement he does not have hear-associated shortness of breath, but feels like he is not getting enough air when he breathes.Would appreciate any suggestions, thoughts or experiences from others.Thanks,Grannygrover",
