            "answer": "I am not the Dr but I have been an insulin dependant diabetic for 13 years now and have 2 kids. My OB (high risk pregnancy specialist) told me when I got pregnant that I would have to keep my diabetes in strict tight control. There are many risks in being an insulin dependant diabetic and getting pregnant but many women do it and have healthy babies (me being one!)\u00a0\u00a0Studies have shown that effective control of diabetes during the periconceptional period (refers to the period of time three months before pregnancy through the first three months of pregnancy) in women with diabetes reduces the risk for birth defects in their children.I was told that my children have a 50% higher risk of becoming diabetic than a person w/o diabetes, I was also told that babies can sometime be born with a cleft palate, heart problems. Both my kids are just fine! Make sure if you guys are planning on kids that she really takes care of herself before conception also! Dr told me increase intake of folic acid and make sure to take my multivitamin before conception and to keep those blodd sugars in tight control! Hope this helped!! :)",
