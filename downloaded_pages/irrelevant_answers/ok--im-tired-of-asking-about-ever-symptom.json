            "answer": "Only thing you can do is take a test when your period is due or contact your doctor and request a blood test. Most \"symptoms\" of pregnancy are the exact as pms symptoms and some symptoms like nausea and things like that are direct results from increasing hcg levels making you sick which means that you would be showing positive on a pregnancy test. Especially if you believe the date of conception was more then 14 days ago.A lot of us girls on here can tell you that we had every symptom in the book and were SURE we were pregnant and then got our periods. Its just one of those things.",

            "answer": "They would want to see if you're pregnant, yes. Because if you're pregnant it might be considered gestational diabetes. I'm not entirely certain and each doctor is different.Now they might be testing for other things as well. They'll test your blood first to see if it might be something else. The blood test measures your insulin. If it comes back abnormal (high or low) they will probably send you for a glucose tolerance test.Sometime in there they will check for pregnancy. They'll probably use the same vial of blood that you already gave.",

Ive been craving spinach, grapefruits and of course CHOCOLATE. I have been really tired, to the point where I fell asleep at my desk at work. (Im sleeping about 7 hours a night... regular for me if not a bit more) My boobs are sore, nipples are scabby. Headaches, not bad but almost constant. Slightly dizzy at times. Hungrey more than usual. For the past 3 days I have had an increasing pain in the small of my back. I also have been getting a gooey whiteish discharge with no odor for the past month, not as much at night.I think Ive covered everything Ive got now. Let me know what you think.Any imput woudl be greatly appreciated.",
