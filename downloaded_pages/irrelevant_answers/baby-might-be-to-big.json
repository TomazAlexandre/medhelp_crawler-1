            "answer": "I have the same problem yesterday I went to my appointment and the doctor told me I was measuring to big meaning baby might be to big. They are not sure yet though. I had that gestational diabetes blood work done yesterday. I hope is not that. I know how are you feeling right now. I might have to get another ultrasound done in 2 weeks to see if it's the baby that is to big. I am 24 weeks",

            "answer": "There is nothing you can do.Your baby will be big or small because of genes, not how little or how much you eat. Case in point: my firstborn I ate everything in sight and she was little. My second daughter was 8.5 lbs at birth and I hardly ate/gained weight.You need to keep your caloric intake up though because baby needs nutrients, so don't stop eating or eating less (unless of course you're eating more than you should, then cut back).You're still in the 2nd trimester. A lot can change between now and delivery!",

            "answer": "Nutz is totally right! I completely forgot about this friend of mine. She was induced early because they thought her baby was going to be large, but she ended up being under 7 lbs. Doctors can only guess, even with sonogram measurements, how big baby is.",

            "answer": "My last baby was a big baby and my Dr didn't catch it and I naturally delivered a 9lbs13oz baby boy. My son got stuck during birth. My Dr will be inducing me early, and I am thankful for it. If I have another baby that big, he will do a CS and I DONT want one. Full term is considered at 37 weeks and if you figure a baby gains about 1lb a week, my son would have only been about 8lbs. Would have been a lot easier than almost 10lbs.",
