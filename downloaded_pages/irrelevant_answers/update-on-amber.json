            "answer": "Great news, have not heard much of Amber lately but I'm thrilled that things are going well for her at last.\u00a0\u00a0Your positive attitude as a Mom is very inspirational, and one day Amber is going to have one of those \"OH MY GOODNESS\" moments when she realises how awesome it is to be loved so much.\u00a0\u00a0I've been diabetic since I was 3 (I'm 36 now) and a few years back I was in hospital and a woman had just had both her legs amputated due to diabetes - that was \"OH MY GOODNESS\" moment for me, when I realised that my Mom had been so strict with me because she loved me and not because she was trying to be cruel.\u00a0\u00a0Every day now I have a special moment when I tell myself how lucky I am to have a Mom who was prepared to be hated by her ungrateful daughter just so that I would live a long and healthier life.\u00a0\u00a0I told my Mom all this recently and you can just imagine the floods of tears!\u00a0\u00a0But you are amazing Dawn, just like my Mom.\u00a0\u00a0Today I'm going to tell her how much I love her and appreciate her!\u00a0\u00a0So thank you for posting because its reminded me that sometimes we need to say things out loud.",

    "question": "hi everyone, amber had a visit with her cardiologist today.\u00a0\u00a0 good news is her ef is up to 45%, and the reason she is feeling better is that her episodes of SVT have gone down from 749 episodes (max duration of 24 beats) to 166 episodes (max duration 5 beats) on a 48hr holter.\u00a0\u00a0the amount of pac's have gone up a bit since ablation, but since the SVT's are down they are not as debilitating as they were. all of this seems to be from digoxin, since ablation on left was not an option and everything comes from the left. bnp levels are normal.\u00a0\u00a0the echo measurements are up a bit,\u00a0\u00a0but things are finally going in a good direction.\u00a0\u00a0 Now we have time for everyone to figure out what to do about the pac's in the left, since surgery may be the only option, and to get every one to agree on what course to take next.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks\u00a0\u00a0 dawn",
