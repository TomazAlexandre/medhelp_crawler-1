    "question": "Heloeeee:-)About a year and half ago I was raped, but I haven't yet said anything since it was family,and my family has been through too much pain the past year. But about 6 months or so ago I developed septic ingrown hair-like sores, not on my genitals, but next to it on both sides.\u00a0\u00a0I've been feeling sick and tired for months without end and the last 2 days I have pelvic pain.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if it could be chlamydia? I've had such ingrown hair-like sores since I started trimming there years ago, but they usually come 1 at a time and go away within a month... it looks the same, but it's been there for months, and it swears, sometimes bleeds, and then just goes back to being painless again, though still remaining.\u00a0\u00a0What I've read about std's is that the sores are painless and usually goes away, that's why I'm asking, I sometimes have a discharge, brownish, smells like bleach or chemicals.\u00a0\u00a0I'm confused because my symptoms also seems to bring concern for diabetes - the smallest of scratch will swear, at this stage my legs are covered in swollen sores, so it all could be diabetes and not chlamydia. I'm married and my husband works for this family member - which we are suing now for work-related issues... so now really isn't a good time for me to pop the news of what happened, everybody is beyond stressed right now... so I'd rather ask you first, does it sound like chlamydia? Thanx",
