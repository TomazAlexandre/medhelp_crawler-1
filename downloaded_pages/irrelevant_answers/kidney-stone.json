            "answer": "Hello,The kidney stone is probably a separate problem from the diabetes.7 mm is not so large.\u00a0\u00a0With your Dr's consent you may choose to observe (and drink plenty of fluids to try to flush it out).\u00a0\u00a0There are also other approach which is using ultrasonic wave to break up the stone, though I don't know how applicable this is to a small stone.In any case, also work to control your blood sugar very well (diet, exercise, medication), to keep your overall health as good as possible.",

            "answer": "With all due respect to Super_sally888, a kidney stone at 7mm is a rather large stone. 85% of stones up to 5mm pass on their own, but there is still the 15% that don't, or won't. At 7mm, you've got a good sized stone and if I were you, I'd let the Urologist do the surgery to remove it. Your Urologist most likely will either go in and lazer it into small pieces and then remove the pieces or will go in and get it with \"the basket\" and remove it.A stone that size (7mm) can block your urine flow and can cause you\u00a0\u00a0other problems if not removed. I know because I had three stones removed last week, one of which was 5mm and was blocking my urine flow, causing my kidney to swell to one and a half times its normal size.",
