            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Fungal infections are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove. Vitiligo could be an option and only a clinical examination would help in ruling out the possible causes.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

            "answer": "Hi,Im 12 and i have the same thing on both of my knees. I think ,bascilly, that its \"Vitiligo\". I got my white spots from being out in the sun too often. But, I would recomend you see a doctor to identify what it is. It's okay, the white spots are not harmful. And yes, they do go away for some time and come back. My spots go away in the winter because i barely get any sun.And they come back in summer. But its okay ,dont panic, ther are NOT harmful :)",
