            "answer": "Hi!Ideally a HIV antibody test should be done within a month of exposure (will be positive for fast developers of antibodies).\u00a0\u00a0 Almost everyone who is infected will have a positive antibody test within 3 months. Hence it should be repeated after 3 months. Last test should be done at 6 months for slow antibody developers. If this is negative HIV is ruled out.Your symptoms may be due to anxiety and stress. If you have bowel problems then inflammatory bowel disorders should be ruled out.Other possibilities are thyroid problems, diabetes and lupus.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
