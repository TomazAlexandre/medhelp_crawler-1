            "answer": "It does appear that you may have a fungal infection from using the antibiotics.You need to book an appointment to see the doctor as soon as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Get a swab taken from the skin and have it sent to the laboratory for analysis.If it is found that you have a fungus, or the doctor may decide by looking at the skin that it is a fungal problem, he may prescribe oral fungal medications for you to use as well as an antifungal cream or antifungal spray to use as well.\u00a0\u00a0You will also need to have an emollient to use instead of soap.So, don't use any soap, shower or bath gels, they will aggravate the skin more.\u00a0\u00a0Use non perfumed soap, soap that has the same pH level as our skin, baby washes may be fine.\u00a0\u00a0If you can get some Dermol 600 from the pharmacy or the doctor prescribe it for you, this would be a good thing to use in your bath water.\u00a0\u00a0Dermol 600 is an antimicrobial solution that you squirt some into your bath water.Get a big box or tub of Epsom Salts (you can get this on line) and have your bath with 2 or 3 cups full of the salt added to the bath water.\u00a0\u00a0You can still squirt in some Dermol 600.\u00a0\u00a0You will need to put some baby oil or coconut oil into the bath water, because the Epsom Salts is very drying on its own.\u00a0\u00a0What it does, it neutralises the pH level of the skin and the bugs do not like that.As your skin is the way it is at the moment, it will take quite some time for it to heal and get better.\u00a0\u00a0Hygiene is very important as well as doing the above.Wear cotton pants and not nylon and manmade fabrics and no tight trousers.\u00a0\u00a0This is so that your skin can breathe.\u00a0\u00a0Any sweating will make it worse.You may need to be on the antifungal capsules for a few weeks or more before your skin problem clears up as well as using\u00a0\u00a0the lotions and potions.Don't have any sex until you are well again.\u00a0\u00a0When you have sex again and use condoms, use the latex free ones.\u00a0\u00a0Some people get allergies to latex.When you see your doctor, ask him to send you for a fasting glucose test to see if you have glucose intolerance, pre diabetes or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 It is very common to get lots of these boil things and skin problems in the inner thighs and on the genitals when someone has glucose intolerance, pre diabetes or diabetes.Coconut oil is antibacterial and antifungal and a great moisturiser so you can apply that to your irritated skin - only use the virgin organic oil.\u00a0\u00a0Natural set yogurt will help to reduce any inflammation and itching.Let us know how you get on.Best wishes.",

    "question": "I'm gonna try and make this short and sweet. In the middle\u00a0\u00a0of March I was diagnosed with a bacteria infection..had them before so I know all about them. I didn't take the medication as soon as I got them, I\u00a0\u00a0was going on a vacation aND could not promise I wouldn't drink.Right before the vacation (March 24) got waxed. And march 25th started my trip to south Padre islands tx. Within the first couple days of being there on noticed 2 things. One was a large lump on my inner thigh.. the I wasn't too worried about being that I always get them and assumed it was an ingrown hair. And the other thing was I had 3 smaller pimple looking bumps spread on on the fatty top of the vagina. They went away within a day and a half but I was still worried about it. When I got home the next week I called my doc he said the larger one sounds like a sebaceous cyst and the smaller ones were probably due to the change on weather (humidity damp moist)So that was that right... no! Another huge lump popped up at the top of my vag. And I was feeling like I was coming down with something.\u00a0\u00a0I looked up home remedies and made another appt.April 6 went and saw a completely different doctor she also said it was a sebaceous cyst, gave me antibiotics and sent me on my way.At that point I was a day or 2 from being done with Flagyl and had another 10 da supply of the antibiotics.Here I am over a week off all medication and I have noticed dry itchy skin 'down there'. So dry that skin would tear and get little cracks that stung when I bent wrong or when pee got in it. The skin would burn and now it looks white with red spots and feels dry ND scaly to touch.I took 1 day monistat on Monday that seemed to help a little, but it's still dry and flaka with red spots, that kind of look like new skin coming in between the white ones. There's a pic in my profile from sunday. If anyone has been through this and has information that would help please post.\u00a0\u00a0I have already scheduled another appt but the anxiety and anticipation is killing me. And the Internet is not helping.",
