            "answer": "I have type 2 diabetes, and IBS...and in the process of going through tests for some kind of tummy troubles,\u00a0\u00a0like celiac's (negative).Anyhow what I have found that helps with keeping blood sugars a little more under control, is \"Glucerna\".I am newly diagnosed with diabetes, and have hit way too many hypoglycemic times, and since drinking one Glucerna a day, helps me out.\u00a0\u00a0And what else is odd, its helping me with tummy troubles too, like the bloating, cramping, diarreah....\u00a0\u00a0I have had diarreah for 16 years, and for the past week or so, it seems to have stopped.And the added bonus to Glucerna is your getting your vitamins, minerals, proteins, carbs, etc all in one drink.\u00a0\u00a0I love the idea of replacing a meal with a quick drink!Hope this helps.Talk to ya laterLaurie",

            "answer": "Please check out this website. www.lowdosenaltrexone.orgThe Crones study is on that page - scroll down. You will see the nothing less than remarkable results they got after 4 weeks of taking this. The drug has no side effects. Read the credentials of the doctor who discovered this. - Harvard doctor.Pharma's are not interested in this drug because they cannot own the patent. The drug has been around a long time but used in higher doses. So all the studies are patient funded. It costs only $30 a month - without insurance.It is also used for other disease and getting fantastic results - MS for one. You can find an MS group on yahoo and hear what they have to say.Don't be surprised if your doc is not interested in it, but show him the study anyhow. Your best bet is to go to an Integrative Doctor for a script. The drug is also used off label\u00a0\u00a0for other diseases than the ones I mentioned.... Please check into it, It will help you and then tell others who are suffering with Crones.I wish you the best.MO",
