            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to learn about your friend. Severe hemophilia could be the reason for his dizziness. Maybe controlling and treating it to some extent will control the symptoms. Repeated infusions can also cause dizziness. Possibility of anemia or diabetes co-existing should be looked into and so also a poor sleep pattern. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please ask your friend to discuss these possibilities with his doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello,I was wondering if anyone else has had these symptoms or has any idea of what to do. Someone very close to me has been suffering w/ dizziness and extreme tiredness all the time. Not like the room is spinning, but sort of an out of reality feeling with blurred vision. He is a 35 year old male who has severe hemophilia.He has been to the eye doctor(they wear glasses/contacts) but the Dr. said they were fine. Other blood tests have come back normal.He tells me every day how much the dizziness bothers him and he feels like he can't take it anymore because it is interfering with his life. I wish I knew what to do. He just constantly feels dizzy/blurred vision/out of reality/tired. He does not drink, do drugs or smoke, drink caffeine, etc.I wish I knew what to do so I thought I'd post the question here and see if I could find some help.Thanks so much,C",
