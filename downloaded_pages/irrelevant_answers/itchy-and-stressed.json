            "answer": "The feet and hands are worrisome, as these can be symptoms of diabetes.Especially if there is no rash.IF you have been tested for that, and came back negative, then I would start looking at things like hand,foot, and mouth disease, eczema, psoariasis, allergies, dry skin, nerve damage, and other much worse problems.\u00a0\u00a0Because you said it's under the skin, it sounds more like a nerve condition.There are so many things that it could be, and without testing it may be hard to figure out.What have you tried so far? If it's eczema, bathing will only make it worse. Water is not always good for the skin, even though we are mostly made of water. Odd isn't it? lolAsking a pharmacist will usually provide great results. They know their medications!There are many OTC creams and lotions that provide relief.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much. My father has diabetes and when they tested my sugar it was .7 too high it was 5.7 so I don't know if that could be it but if its like a nerve thing would it go away on its own? And What's with the itch between my breasts and on my one nipple?",

    "question": "I've got an itch under my skin. Usually on the soles and bridge of my feet, on the palms of my left hand, some of my fingers, between my breasts, on my left nipple only and one spot on my head but its always on the same places. It feels as though it gets inflamed or worse when I scratch but the itch doesn't go away. Skin appears normal no rash whatsoever. Been like this for 3 days now. What could it be?",
