    "question": "I have been trying to concieve for about 7 or 8 months now, I have endometriosis and have had 2 surgeries and been put into induce menopause for a yr and a half. I have had my periods again this month will be a year. I was late last month by 5 days and I am late this month so far 3 days. I have taken a first response pg test and it is negative. My nipples are bigger and soooo sore I am sleeping with a sports bra to help the pain. I have had pelvic pain on both sides, the right side comes and goes but the left hurts when I sit mostly. I am new to my area and I do not have a doctor yet. I takeMetformin for Diabetes, I am just not sure if I should go to the ER or not? The pain is worse when I have a full bladder? Any ideas on what I should do?",
