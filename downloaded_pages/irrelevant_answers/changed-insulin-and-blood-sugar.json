            "answer": "RL has given you sage advice. I agree with it. If changing the time of your injection according to your doctor's suggestion (after you talk to him) doesn't help, you may want to ask your doctor if there is a type of insulin that will match your body's routine better. There are many available types, and all have slightly different peak action and length of duration times. There may be one that matches your own body's clock better. We wish you the best.",

    "question": "I have recently changed to new insulin. I am now taking Levemir in the morning and at night taking Apidra. Since I have changed to this insulin my blood sugar is going upby alot. I was at 176 this morning and within a few hours it was at 296. This has never happened before and I have not changed anything in my eating. Why is it going up so much and how can I make this stop?",
