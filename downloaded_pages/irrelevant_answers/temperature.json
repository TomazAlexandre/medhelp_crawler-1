            "answer": "Hi that is a low temperature. Usually it goes up with an infection unless it is viral. Could the thermometer be off? Also, perhaps the antibiotics are affecting you some way. The amylase is made in the pancreas. Do you have pain in your left side? The lipase is more sensitive or correct test. Do you have diabetes or have you been checked for that? If not you may want to ask the doctor about it.mkh9",

Recently I had a colonoscopia and nothing was found. Our winter is unusually cold this year but that doesn't explain my low temperature in the morning and normal by the late afternoon.",

            "answer": "Some people do run low on their temperture naturally. So, I don't know it is a problem. Your Amylase could be high due to the UTI, some UTI's affect the kidneys and this would raise your Amylase. Did you have a high Amylase before the UTI or during? I would retest after the UTI clears. The stomach pain is another matter. If your amylase and lipase are still high after the infection you should see your doctor about the stomach pain. It could be pancreatitis.",
