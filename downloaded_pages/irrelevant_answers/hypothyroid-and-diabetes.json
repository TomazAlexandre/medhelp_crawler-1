            "answer": "If we have one autoimmune disease we are prone to other autoimmune diseases. And as many as our immune system wants to give us and as many simultaneously.Hypo Hashi (as well as Graves' Disease) and Type 1 diabetes are autoimmune diseases. There is a link between autoimmune thyroid disorders and Type 1 diabetes because both diseases involve the endocrine system. Thyroid disorders can have a significant effect on blood glucose levels, in which an overactive thyroid may increase insulin requirements, while an underactive thyroid can decrease insulin requirements.\u00a0\u00a0There also appears to be a higher than normal occurrence of thyroid disorders in people with type 2 diabetes, with hypothyroidism being the most common.When the diabetes and hypothyroidism are properly controlled with treatment the weight should automatically come off - of course that is with a proper diabetic diet and exercise. That is what I was told by family (hypo) diabetecs. On the other hand, we are not all alike.Good Luck.",
