            "answer": "Hello,How are you?Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Such symptoms are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the stinging is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders are transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis9already ruled out in your case) or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Warm regards.",

            "answer": "what about sweating? if you work up a sweat does the pain subside?i have the same problem. it usually goes away in spring/summer and comes on strong in fall/winter. if my skin is dry and a do something to raise my heart rate/body temp, my skin on my scalp, back, chest and arms starts painfully prickling. sometimes it's debilitating. usually i can deal with it. once I cool off it stops. if i make myself break a sweat it stops too.i think it has to do with dry skin and sweat glands but i'm not sure.",

    "question": "My skin is burning and stinging and prickly pretty much all over, on arms, legs and back most notably.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to calm down at night and then starts up as I get moving and going for the day, intensifying as I go.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for MS and other common ailments that may cause neuropathy, but nothing has been identified.\u00a0\u00a0I have been hurting like this for nearly two years and nothing seems to help.\u00a0\u00a0I have been taking Gabapentin and amytriptiline but it doesn't really seem to do anything other than maybe take the edge off.\u00a0\u00a0I put lotions on my skin in hopes that something will dull these symptoms.Has anyone experienced this type of pain and can anyone offer a suggestion for treatment?",
