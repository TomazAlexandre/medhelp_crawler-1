            "answer": "Well I didn't have the loss of appetite problem until my 15th week (this week). And I'm wondering the same thing. I guess we just have to wait it out. I looked online and found a few suggestions to try protein shakes until your appetite returns. But I'm a little weary of that.",

            "answer": "Here's the exact info I found online:\"...Thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, and liver problems have been associated with this. In most women, it eases by the 20th week which is good because the baby really cannot grow and develop as efficiently as he needs to if the mother's nutrient needs are not being met. You may see signs of intrauterine growth restriction by 24-26 weeks if you are not getting adequate calories. You may also want to test your urine for ketones which are by-products of fat metabolism and these can be toxic to baby's brain.\"\"I would recommend that the calories that you do get be dense with nutrients. Eat Total or Product 19, sports shakes or Ensure. Vitamin C can stimulate appetite so consider drinking some juice upon arising in the morning and waiting an hour to eat breakfast.\"\"I really believe this will ease up and your body will do what is best for your baby. Try not to be overly concerned or anxious and it will resolve on its own.\"",
