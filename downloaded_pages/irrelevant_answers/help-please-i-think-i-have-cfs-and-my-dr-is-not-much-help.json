    "question": "For a couple of years I've been going to the Dr. complaining about a lot of symptoms/issues. I generally like her, as she listens and shows real concerns.., but she just keeps throwing pills at me for individual things and I just kept telling my Dr..., this isn't right, to have all these different things. I'm only 39.., and I walk a lot.., and I eat my fruits and veggies. I don't drink or smoke.I finally wrote down everything they were treating me for and every diagnosis they had thrown at me and asked my Dr. if they looked related to her., if there could be an underlying cause. She just looked a little overwhelmed (yeah doc, how do u think I feel?)I am about 40-50 lb.s overweight.., so the Dr. says most of my problems would go away if I'd loose weight.Well, OK, I get that weight loss it needed.., but I weigh 175.., that's not obese for my height. And I have friends that weigh quite a bit more than I do and don't deal with any of these problems, let alone all of them. I feel \"hungover\" all the time...,\u00a0\u00a0and I stopped drinking a long time ago.I have dizziness, foggy head, back pain, joint pain, all sorts of digestive problems, low thyroid, headaches, fatigue, type II diabetes, IBS, 'woman' problems, irregualr heart beat, anxiety, oversensitivity to chemicals and meds.., and more..,I finally went online just looking for anyone who also had a \"hungover\" feeling without warning or cause.., (which I have a lot and I hate).., just to try to find some sort of natural relief.., and I ran into others who have CFS who describe many of the things I have.It's getting really bad as I need to sleep like 9-10 hours per night and then it takes me 1-2 hours just to fell \"ok\" so I can start doing things. I have to call in sick to work all the time and I don't think I'm going to be able to keep working. This *****. I'm really scared about my career, my house payments, supporting my family, and my medical insurance (that I desperately need).Questions:1) Is there a way to get a specific diagnosis to see if this is my problem?2) If I do, will it matter? Or will they just keep throwing pills to treat symptoms anyway?3) What type of specialist deals with CFS? Any?Thanks for any input.",
