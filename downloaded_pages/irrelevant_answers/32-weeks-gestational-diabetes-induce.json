            "answer": "I am having my 6th child in March.\u00a0\u00a0I have had gestational diabetes with 5 of my 6 pregnancies. I've carried all of my children full term without any complications. I am not sure of the reasoning behind your dr.'s decision's or the particulars behind your pregnancy, but I also did not have to have stress tests done on any of my pregnancies. Your Dr. may have other reasonings behind the stress tests that you aren't aware of. I would question everything,\u00a0\u00a0what you can do to help you and the baby, a change in your diet, health style, share with your dr. Your weekly diet/health style,\u00a0\u00a0so the dr. can have a better idea of what you can do if anything that can help minimize stress on the baby.If you are forced into early labor, know that everything will be ok. Try not to stress,\u00a0\u00a0listen to calming music, watch a good movie show, pray, read your bible.\u00a0\u00a0Just know everything will be ok. *HUGS*",
