            "answer": "First of all, why are you feeding him low fat foods? Low fat is not necessary to control diabetes and especially not for a child unless he is grossly overweight. Sugar free, yes, low fat no. He is eating a lot of carbs; for an adult this would drive his insulin use up, but I understand carbs aren't limited as much for children. You might want to go onto a board where there are a lot more parents and children with Type 1. Send me a private message if you want some urls. As for why he is always hungry, some of that just comes with the territory when you combine diabetes and children, but some of it might be controllable. What are his blood sugars like? Are they under control? You might also be feeding the insulin by giving him too much insulin for what he is eating. Do you do an Insulin:Carb ratio or is he on set doses for each meal?",

            "answer": "Well, I'm almost always hungry. I've been told that insulin makes you hungry??? I've been told that the more carbs you eat the hungrier you get. He could be going through a grow spur or maybe he's doing a lot of exercise. My nephew is always hungry and skinny as he can be but he does a lot of exercise too.",
