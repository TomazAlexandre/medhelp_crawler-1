            "answer": "Yes the retina is normally transparent. OCT looks at eye tissue on a micrscopic basis looking for swelling, abnormal bleeding, tumors, glaucoma damage, etc. OCT looks under the surface. The indirect ophthalmoloscope (lens held near eye) looks at the surface of the retina.JCH MD",

    "question": "Hello again DoctorsI posted a message yesterday about the incidental discovery that I am a glaucoma suspect during an eye exam for an unrelated concern.About 10 days, there appeared in my left eye, at about the 7 0'clock position, just outside my point of focus, a spot that looks like what you see after you've looked at something bright. It is bright against dark backgrounds and when i close me eyes, and it is dark when I look at something light. It does not move and varies in intensity in a random fashion. But it does not go away. I do suffer from migraine with aura, but this is totally different from the C shaped scintillating scotoma, and is only in my left eye.The opthalmologist looked at my retains and took pictures of them and said they appeared healthy. he suggested this strange blob may be a migraine variant, but he didn't seem too sure.The spot still hasn't gine away and I am beside myself with worry. Could it be some kind of occlusion that he missed? The whole migraine theory just seems like a stab in the dark to me, and i am worried that something might have got by him undetected. He seemed willing to write this off as stress, if not out and out hypochondria.Have you heard of anything like this before? is it possible for something serious to have been missed?There is only one opthalmologist in my town and I don't drive.Oh, I am 41, in good health, no diabetes, or high blood pressure or obesity etc. No meds either.I would really love for you to offer you input.Thank youMelinda",
