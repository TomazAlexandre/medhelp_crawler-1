            "answer": "Michael,For a low normal EF there really isnt any clear cut answer to your problem. For me it would boil down to whether there were other reasons to have you on the medications such as documented coronary disease, hypertension, diabetes, or symtoms.Otherwise, periodic followup would not be unreasonable.good luck",

            "answer": "I was told by my cardiologist that it was likely that I got the cardiomyopathy from a virus. I don't suffer from high blood pressure, just high cholesterol, which I take Lipitor for.On my own I'm taking potassium/magnesium supplements and CQ10 (is that what it's called?) to see if that improves things.Any advice would be appreciated.",

        {
            "answer": "Certainly the supplements you are taking won't harm you, but there is some controversey on whether they actually do anything for you. I am referring ro rhe CoQ10. The magnesium and potassium are essential for a normal heart rhythm. Make sure you follow you doctor's advice. Cardiomyopathy that was cause by a virus earlier in life likely won't get worse. You need to have great Blood Pressure control and follow up with yearly Echos. Are you taking a beta blocker or ace inhibitor or both? Wouldn't hurt.Erik",

    "question": "I was diagnosed last year with a \"mild cardiomyopathy,\" discovered during a MUGA scan after I complained about chest pain. My EF at the time was 49%, which they told me was \"low normal.\" I went to my primary care doctor, who referred me to a cardiologist. After an echocardiogram, he told me my EF was still holding at 49%. As he explained it, he thought the EF would remain stable and I shouldn't worry about it.But I am worried about it. Several people I have spoken to about cardiomyopathy insist that I should be on an ACE inhibitor. The cardiologist said that he didn't think I needed to be on any meds right now. I'm feeling fine and have no symptoms related the CHF or anything like that.Can you advise me on the best course of action? Is it safe to just wait and go for yearly check-ups, or should I insist on meds to prevent any further damage?Many thanks.MichaelNY",
