            "answer": "There is no specific menu for diabetics.The thing to remember is that you can eat everything, but you do need to cut down drastically or cut out sugar products.\u00a0\u00a0Do bear in mind that some foods do have hidden sugars, so do read the food labels.\u00a0\u00a0Something that is classed as \"light\" does not necessarily mean it is low on sugar.Watch your portion sizes and eat a healthy and well balanced diet with fruit and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Grilling, boiling for example instead of frying.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't just the sugary foods that can spike up your sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Use wholemeal products as these will release energy slowly and will stop you having sugar spikes and slumps that can cause hypoglycaemia.\u00a0\u00a0 Avoid processed foods, junk and sugary foods and fizzy drinks.\u00a0\u00a0A small half glass full of fresh orange juice will be fine.Eat 3 healthy meals a day - breakfast, lunch and evening meal, but also have a healthy snack in between.\u00a0\u00a0A healthy snack can be an apple, a yogurt, celery with peanut butter, a small banana, a handful of grapes.If you follow the healthy eating plan and only have a small sweet treat or a piece of cake occasionally you will be fine.Doing some form of exercise whatever you choose, even walking is fine, will also help to control your sugar levels.Don't forget that what goes into your mouth is a form of fuel that gives you energy and because you have diabetes, the food that you eat that is converted by the body into glucose is not being utilised properly.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that doesn't cause sugar spikes or has any calories is plain water.Hope that helps.",
