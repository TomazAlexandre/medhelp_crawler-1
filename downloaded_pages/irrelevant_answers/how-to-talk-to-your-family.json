            "answer": "It a heard thing to explain to non-sufferers. Even family.Obviously my Wife and family know about my condition, but no amount of explaining will every help them truly understand what it feels like.It's not that they aren't supportive or don't care. It's just that they simply do not have the ability to really understand how much it hurts.You can Google search \"explaining depression to family\" on the internet and a buch of good articles can be found on how to communicate the illness to loved ones.It helps, but don't expect any non-sufferer to truly understand the pain because they simply can not understand it. Just as I can not understand the Mania that a Bi-polar person suffers. I know it's painful, but I don't have the ability to truly understand how it feels.",

            "answer": "If you are worried about the disappointment (one of the main reasons I haven't told my family about mine, after over two years), spin it more towards the physical side of it. I found that people can understand that better, even if they can't grasp how I'm feeling.\"I have a chemical unbalance in my brain that affects my moods\" helps me explain it, and when I say depression later on, they don't dismiss it as being \"all in my head\".Medical records might also help: think of it as any other illness: they wouldn't be disappointed at you if you had, say, diabetes!Best of luck with telling them: you are very brave!",
