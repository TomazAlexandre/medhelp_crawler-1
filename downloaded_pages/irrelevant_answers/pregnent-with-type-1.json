            "answer": "Hello,how are you going?Common birth defects with high blood sugars are damage to the heart and spinal cord.\u00a0\u00a0I would think that at least the worst issues (if they exist) should be able to be seen with a high level ultrasound.No one can know for sure if there is damage done or not.\u00a0\u00a0But I'd think that if you control very well now there is still a chance that your baby is healthy.Regardless YOU need to be healthy as well and need to work to control your diabetes well.",
