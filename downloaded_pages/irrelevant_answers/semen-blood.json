    "question": "Recently I have noticed traces of blood in semen; today my wife and I were intimate and it was completely dark red and looked almost \"paint-like\".\u00a0\u00a0I am in late 50's and have high blood pressure and type two diabetic; I have a physical every year and this year (9 months ago) had a colonsocopy.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor (VA Hospital) suggested it, because I had never had one.\u00a0\u00a0Everything was okay.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing I do different now is: 1-the VA put me on a new med about a month ago called Gemfibrozil.\u00a0\u00a02- my job changed and now I sit at a desk all day and before I was on the move and rarely sat down.\u00a0\u00a03- I have been under a lot of stress in the last few months.\u00a0\u00a0There is no pain or swelling that I am aware of; I do have erectile dysfunction somewhat, but my wife and I attribute that to age and the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Is this common?\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed a trace of blood in the last month or so in my semen, but just figured it was do to stress or the \"new position\" of sitting on my prostrate for most of the day.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
