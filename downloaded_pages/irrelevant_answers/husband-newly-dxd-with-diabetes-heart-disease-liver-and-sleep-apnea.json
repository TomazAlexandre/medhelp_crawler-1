            "answer": "I'm not a doctor so you can take my reply as you like. The questions you post should be directed to your husbands attending physician(s). If he is dx with HCV he will need to see a Hepatologist, a liver disease specialist. Being \"overweight\u00a0\u00a0and not active\" is not good for his heart nor his diabetes. He needs to lose the weight, period. And do moderate exercise, such as walking daily to help lower his glucose. And most important, start eating healthier, a better nutrition goes a long way in maintaining life.",

            "answer": "In answer to your questions:1. I don't think anyone can give you a reliable life expectancy estimate. It would depend upon the total clinical picture, the nature of his heart disease, and his liver disease, if any. However, other important determining factors are a) how well he controls his blood sugar, blood pressure, cholesterol and weight b) lifestyle factors such as exercise, diet, and smoking c) whether he address his sleep apnea and d) his psychological attitude / willingness to educate himself on his condition and take an active part in managing it.2. If I'm not mistaken, any of the things you mentioned - seizure, passing out, or coma, could occur if he is not able to control his blood sugar. If you want to take an active part in managing his condition I would think you would want to know his blood sugar level every time it is measured, both day-to-day and A1C (three month average).3. The chances he could require an amputation or become blind from diabetic retinopathy depends to a large extent on blood sugar control. Some people, sadly, do everything possible to exert such control and still wind up with these terrible conditions.You can find much more comprehensive and detailed information at the\u00a0\u00a0web site of the American Diabetic Association at www.diabetes.org.Educate yourself and your husband. There is a great deal to learn to manage diabetes well.Please note that I am not a physician, either.Good luck to you and your husband.",

    "question": "My husband was just diagnosed with full blown Diabetes and already has a heart condition. He is overweight\u00a0\u00a0and not active. The doctor said it was very serrious and he is at a huge risk for heart attack. He has had Sleep Apnea for a long time since over 12 years. His heart problem he has had a long time. He is of African and Aboriginal First Nations nationality. His liver enzymes are really high and they are going to test him for Hepititas C because I have that. He is getting leg cramps at night and blurred vision, extreem thirst and urinating a lot, loosing weight quickly.His father died with complications from Diabetes, lung problmes and cancer. My husband has been coughing up black stuff from his lungs for a bout 9 months. Xrays have not come in yet.I need a very honest answer please to 3 questions as I too have life threatening conditions. We have young children and no family help. I need to prepare for the worst and hope for the best.My two questions are:1. With so many health problems and some that have been bothering him for awhile, what is my husbands life expectancy now that he has diabetes too ?2. What should I know ? How would a medical emergancy manifest itself ? I want to know what to do if he should have some sort of attack. Could he sezuire, pass out, go into a coma ? What should I be looking for and be aware of ? What should I do if I see something may be wrong?3. What are the chances he could become crippled or blind ? I myself am having problems with my limbs and joints and becoming disabled from such. So I am thinking we should move to where things are wheel chair accessable and such.",
