            "answer": "Hello,Spitting during talking could be due to excess production of saliva or poor muscular control. Talking softer often helps with spitting too much. Salivary secretion can be reduced by certain types of medication, like anti-histaminic drugs. A foreign body in the oral cavity or a side effect of some medications can cause excess production of saliva .A muscle tone might be less than adequate. It is best to consult a doctor if the symptoms are severe or persistent. I hope it helps.Best wishes and regards!",
