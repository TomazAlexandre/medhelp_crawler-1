            "answer": "I have seen many things like it. Every week there is a new \"Cure\" for diabetes. It usually ends up being somebody selling something. Unfortunately, some people are desparate and not able to accept that diabetes management is hard work on a daily basis and are looking for a \"quick fix\". It is just like the diet industry which makes billions of dollars on people anxious to lose work \"magically\". I resent diabetics being taken advantage of and the time they waste chasing magic cures when they should spend it learning how to manage weight, dietary changes, exercise and working with their doctor for the correct medication regimen.",

But I will continue to recommend healthy diabetes practices such as weight loss, exercise, carb reduction and doctor prescribed medication and warning against fads that advertise quick fixes and cures. I didn't intend for this to become a personal argument. My only goal is to help other diabetics as I'm sure you mean to as well.",

            "answer": "Gymdandee, this forum is made up of a bunch of ordinary people, closer the end than the beginning, who just want to try to give others a push in the right direction.My apologies if I seemed to be insulting you.As Zoelula stated, the idea is to recommend weight loss, carb reduction and discourage fads.My feelings are that diabetes is a life-threatening problem, and the answer is to push people into following the instructions of a physician, and enroll in a carefully supervised program.If there are specific suggestions or studies that are rational and documented then that is all well and good, but \"magic cures\" and off-ball cures delay treatment, and that endangers people's lives.",

            "answer": "Wow, I can't believe no one took the time to Google Dr Hyman and diabetes. Googling reveals he's no gook or just selling books on a fad or magic cure. Google \"UltraWelness\", his blog. He believes that it's possible, through an aggressive approach of lifestyle, nutritional support, and occasionally medications to reverse prediabetes and T2 diabetes. He also believes in the long run that dependencies on diabetes drugs leads to internal organ damage.Strong points are made on proper nutrition, exercise, and stress management. On the flip side he makes supplement recommendations that I disagree with. For example, mixing ginkgo biloba and bitter melon. Mixing these two leads to digestive disorders. Ginkgo consumed with many OTC and Rx medications has known interactions. Bottom line do not take supplements unless one knows everything about them, especially drug interactions.So thank you gymdandee for passing on this free information.",
