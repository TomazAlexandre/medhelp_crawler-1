            "answer": "You're perfectly fine, was it measuring from an ultrasound or fundal height using the tape measure? My fundal height always measured 2-3 weeks behind, and although i did have a small baby (5lb 13oz) he was perfectly healthy. And that was at 39 weeks. AND i had gestational diabetes, go figure. So i wouldn't worry about it too much, only being 1 week out is fine.Also, i'll just add that my sister always measured 2 weeks ahead, and her bub was a little on the larger side, (8lb 14oz) but he was healthy too, just a bigger boy, didn't help that his dad was a big man too!!",
