            "answer": "I read briefly about this condition and from what I gather, normally people gain weight, your problem is that you feel sick when you eat, and don\u2019t eat, so you\u2019re not gaining any weight. I would suggest following diet plans with people that have digestive diseases. For example, someone with IBS (irritable bowl syndrome) or someone with a stomach ulcer will choose foods that do not irritate them.

            "answer": "I am new to this forum.Hashimoto's is an auto immune disease. If you have an auto immune disease, you are open to any other; i.e. lupus, diabetes, celiac, osteoporosis.Celiac is now diagnosed by a blood test.I am having some issues with my thyroid right now. We haven't had a determination yet as to what kind.There are some doctors now who test for celiac when someone comes into their office with diabetes, or hashimoto's or osteoporosis.The diet is easy once you get used to it. And, the results are that folks who are gluten free have healthier life styles.My son is a nurse, and he has celiac. He researchs the latest information on auto-immune disorders.",

            "answer": "If you are nauseated after eating, and especially having anxiety & palpitations, those are good signs that you may be deficient in magnesium. If you are also constipated a lot or have a cycle of being constipated followed by diarrhea, this can also be a sign of low magnesium. Lack of magnesium also negatively affects thyroid function. Try taking a supplement for the Recommended Daily Allowance of magnesium for 1-2 weeks and see if your symptoms improve. (Don't take too much more than that, and keep in mind that many heartburn & indigestion remedies contain magnesium. Too much magnesium can cause diarrhea and other problems.) After a few weeks, you can tweak your dosage up or down a little until your bowel movements stay fairly regular (no constipation or diarrhea.) That works best for me. If you drink a lot of soda, you may also want to cut back on these as they may negatively impact magnesium absorption.Many people with thyroid problems are also deficient in selenium, so you might want to look into that as well.Here are some websites to check out:http://www.ithyroid.com/ (sections on nutrition & supplements for people with thyroid problems, including Hashimoto's)http://mgwater.com/ (info on many different problems associated with magnesium deficiency)",

            "answer": "Here are someting that I have found out not only from personal experience, but through the Dr, that I see.\u00a0\u00a0Here they are for you. No chocolate, alochol, caffeine, thats hard to live without, so I have 2 cups per day. I have also found out that popcorn makes me break out with hives. I'm not sure what kind of meds. that you are taking, so here is one to try. It is over the counter, it ranitidine, it's generic zantac. I take 4 pills in the morning and 4 pills at night. Seems to help. They have also added singulair, which you would have to get fro your Dr. These are just some of the things that I have found that don't make me feel good or cause hives and things that help to keep them away. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Hello,I've been diagnosed with hashimoto's and a low grade connecting tissue disease about 3 years ago. Unlike most thyroid patients, I'm not gaining weight because I feel sick and irritated when I eat most stuff. I'm 24 and 48kg at 163cm.I know that it's not everything that makes me feel sick, but I just don't know what not to eat when I have hashi's. I know stay away from gluten and that's basically everything produced with flour, right?I'm taking 50 mcg eltoxin and 200mcg selenium with birth control pills.What can I eat so that it helps my condition and that I won't feel sick afterwards. Is there a web site or something like that handles hashimoto's and nutrition. I find that they're all about losing weight but I think I'll die if I lose more weight.Thank you very much!",
