    "question": "Over the past 2 weeks I have been having On/Off low\u00a0\u00a0pain level in my chest, But Saturday it got a smewhat worse and actually hurt to the point where I could not almsot breath for about 1 minute.. not because I couldnt just because it was like a pressure sensation. I also had this SHARP pain in my back as well. I decided to take this to my family doctor. I do hav e Diabetes (diagnosed about 2 years ago type 1) and things have been very hard to keep under control. they have me on Symlin and the highest potency Insulin which is U-500 and we are still strugglin somehwat. My doctor did an EKG and came back and sail all look OK. But he insists that I possibly had a \"Silent Heart Attack\" I figure if it was silent I would not have felt anything but after reading that may not be the case i suppose. I also have High BP 150/100 usually and high cholesterol i think the total was 308 obn that (if i remember correctly). They slammed me into a cardiologist for this friday and perosnally i think i am wasting his precious time when he could be helping someone else who needs it. I am a quiet type and do not talk to my wife about this and she didnt even know till yesterday. What are your thoughts and do you see this often? Is this silent heart attck thing goign a little overboard here esepcially if the OKG came back \"OK\"thank you,Michael Sharp",
