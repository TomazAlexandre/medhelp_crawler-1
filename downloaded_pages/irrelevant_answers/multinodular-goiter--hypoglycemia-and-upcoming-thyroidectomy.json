            "answer": "Azqtpies just went through the surgery and many of us have been there too (twice for me) and it was the easiest surgery I have ever had.\u00a0\u00a0I also went through RAI but for an entirely different reason (cancer).\u00a0\u00a0The RAI was more difficult for me than the surgery.You said you had biopsies - were they suspicious or malignant?\u00a0\u00a0*IF* they were, and because the nodules and goiter are growing, please consider surgery, it is the only way to thoroughly get rid of the malignancies.\u00a0\u00a0If your endo is not overly concerned about thyroid cancer (if your nodules are functioning or cystic) then you have more options.Please also keep a close eye on the hypoglycemia - my entire family has had TTs and we all either developed Type II diabetes, prediabetes, or hypoglycemia after our thyroids were removed.",

    "question": "In Dec. 2005, my heart started skipping beats...after seeing several doctors, my OBGYN found a very enlarged thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Had all the bloodtests imaginable, ultrasound of thyroid and biopsy done...after a whole workup at the cardiologist, he said it wasn't my heart.\u00a0\u00a0Holter moniter showed benign PVC's. I don't have the energy like I used to.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on Synthroid in May to try and help shrink the goiter and nodules.\u00a0\u00a0Finally saw an endocrinologist in Aug. who thought not all of this was thyroid related.\u00a0\u00a0Underwent a 6 hr. glucose tolerance test that revealed reactive hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Went back for a check-up at the endo. last week to find out that she suggests a thyroidectomy because the Synthroid isn't working to keep the goiter/ nodules from growing.\u00a0\u00a0I have an app. with the ENT/surgeon next week to discuss surgery further.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to feel better.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that I wouldn't be guarenteed that the heart palpitations would stop after the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I have talked to several women that have had RI done and symptoms stopped afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried about this surgery and if it's the right thing.\u00a0\u00a0I am on 25 mcg's of Synthroid right now, but how will they know what amount to give me after the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I'm afraid I will go up and down like I have over the past year with this...also, I've heard that if you have your thyroid removed that you tend to gain a lot of weight...I have gained about 15 lbs. since all of this has happened and don't want to gain anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone else gone through this?\u00a0\u00a0What's the surgery and afterwards like?",
