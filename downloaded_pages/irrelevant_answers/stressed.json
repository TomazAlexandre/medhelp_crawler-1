            "answer": "If you are a first time mom, most dont feel movement til at least 20 Weeks. The fact that you are out of your first trimester decreases your chance of miscarriage drastically. Let her know that stress will make u miscarry and she is creating that for you! You also prob wont show until around 20 Weeks either. Relax and educate yourself on pregnancy so you know what to look for and what to worry about, if none of that is happening then just enjoy YOUR pregnancy :)",

I figured it would either give me the peace of mind, or give me time to prepare and read up on the problem before the baby was born.\u00a0\u00a0They don't tell you \"yes\" or \"no\" just what your odds are (like 1 in a couple hundred or so-or maybe less). But don't stress too much, I have a GF that was told her odds were 1 in 12 and she had a perfect baby. You can always tell your mom that you are not going to take the test just so she doesn't pester you about it.",
