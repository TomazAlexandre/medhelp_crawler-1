            "answer": "It sounds like it could very well be carpal tunnel. It is worse at night and common in pregnancy and from doing repetitive motions with your hands. Since you are pregnant they probably won't prescribe antiinflammatories for you but you could try a wrist splint. It's shaped to position your wrist correctly relieving the pressure on the nerve. The next step after antiinflammatories and splint is a cortisone injection and lastly surgery.\u00a0\u00a0You may be able to purchase a splint without seeing a dr and see how it goes. Hope this info helps. Good luck to you and congrats on your pregnancy.",

I work in a factory and do some repetitive motions but never had any problem til pregnancy...and I've also got restless legs that are completely driving me crazy. Hope it's just all temporary for us",

            "answer": "I had carpal tunnel and like I posted above those were the steps given to me to treat it. The cortisone injections quieted it down for a while but I ended up having surgery on it and its been perfect ever since. I don't think it will truly be gone unless you have the surgery to release the nerve but there is a chance you can get it more tolerable.",
