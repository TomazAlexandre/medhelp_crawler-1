            "answer": "I think any systolic over 160 deserves a call to the doctor. Something close to 200, you should go to ER.Heart rate - that depends on why the rate is high (I assume you aren't worried about too low). My heart rate jumps as high as 198 bpm but doesn't last long (less than a minute). If you're symptomatic - fainting, can't breathe well, chest pain - see the doctor. If your heart rate is tachy, over 120 for any length of time, like an hour or more, see your doctor.Perhaps someone else has medical recommendations. These are just my own thoughts and how I would handle it. Well, maybe since I don't go to the doctor except when I have to. But these are guidelines I would use for my kids.",

            "answer": "Amy, have you had a diagnosis of being diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0I'm guessing so if you are checking your blood sugar levels.Being diabetic and having lots of heart trouble and high blood pressure issues myself, I can tell you that a fasting glucose reading of 200 would get my attention in a New York minute.\u00a0\u00a0Your arteries are becoming inflamed at that reading and you will start to experience high blood pressure as well as be at risk for blood clots in your heart arteries.\u00a0\u00a0You need to strive for a fasting blood sugar reading of no more than 100, and believe me, if you ignore that advice, there are consequences of heart, eye, kidney disease.I'd advise you to contact your health professional and report the bp reading/blood sugar results asap.\u00a0\u00a0They both are way out of whack, and probably are related.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us informed.",

A fasting glucose level of 150 is very, very high, and 200 is almost off the chart I suggest you go to the American Diabetes Association and look at their information.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes.",
