            "answer": "Hi Penny,\u00a0\u00a0I dont know what your insurance situation is but if you have a PPO you need to make an appt. with a nephrologist (kidney doctor).\u00a0\u00a0I am going to see one this Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure about your tests but I know that pain is sometimes present for kidney issues and diabetes and high blood pressure are the number 1 and 2 reasons for chronic kidney disease respectively.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure about the liver disease (is NASH the non-alcoholic form of fatty liver?---I have drug induced fatty liver--I take Depakote at a high dose due to bipolar disorder and they have told me I need to get off of it or end up with cirrohis in 22 years but I would rather stay sane for my sons sakes then live a long life any day).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I am also not sure how the stroke figures in to all this but I cant think it is a good thing since all bodily systems affect one another--kinda like gears that turn other gears, if one gets a kink in it then all of them will slow down or stop--.\u00a0\u00a0If your gfr has always been more than 60(how much more?\u00a0\u00a0I mean like 61 or more like 90?) then has dropped to 59 it could be due to some other reason and not your kidneys at all.\u00a0\u00a0That is why you need to see a nephrologist.\u00a0\u00a0He will test your blood again and get you a new gfr and also make sure your blood pressure is stable and remains stable.\u00a0\u00a0That is VERY important as is making sure your diabetes stays under control.\u00a0\u00a0Since you are possibly looking at kidney involvement I would stay away from ALL sugar/glucose/sucrose substitutes includine agave since it is actually one of the worsts despite being touted as a good sugar sub.\u00a0\u00a0Be careful and try to use only stevia products.\u00a0\u00a0There are many good stevia products out there and they make delicious treats as well.\u00a0\u00a0Also stay away from NSAIDS, like Ibuprofen.\u00a0\u00a0A good diet to follow is a low protein, low sodium and low phosphorous diet.\u00a0\u00a0There are many good sites to check out for diet and just for good info to help you learn about the kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0Try davita.com, and www.kidneyschool.comGood luck Penny and try not to worry.\u00a0\u00a0I know how that its.\u00a0\u00a0I am the most horrible worryer and it is causing me all kinds of trouble including keeping my blood pressure at stage 2 hypertension for over a month now.----------Tamye",

            "answer": "Actually a GFR of 59 in my opinion, is not bad,, mine is not even that high but with your diabetes and high blood pressure, not a good combo if your GFR is dropping. I would see a nephro like the other poster said but your GFR is certainly not horrible.",

    "question": "I had my GFR done along with my other routine blood work. My sodium has dropped, my Magnesium has dropped\u00a0\u00a0and my chloride level has also dropped under the norm. I been having pain in the middle of my back on the right side and I am extremely tired all the time. I have also noticed I am using the bathroom more often but hardly anything is coming out.My GFR has always been >60 and I noticed this time it dropped down to 59. Is this something I need to be concerned about? I am diabetic, high blood pressure, have NASH a form of liver disease and have suffered one stroke. Are my kidneys okay?Thanks for answeringPenny",
