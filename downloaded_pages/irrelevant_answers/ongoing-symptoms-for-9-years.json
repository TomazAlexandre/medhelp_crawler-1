            "answer": "Ask your doctor if he can get you tested for Helicobacter Pylori.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to test for this is by having a breath or stool test.\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests do not show accurate results.Ask to get checked out also if you have diverticular disease.\u00a0\u00a0The pain can happen when the little pockets that are formed along the colon become blocked with faeces and become inflamed.Make sure that you control your sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0If these are too high or too low you will experience problems with either hypoglycaemia (too low sugar levels.) or hyperglycaemia (too high sugar levels).Get your blood pressure checked out and your ears and throat.Also get your blood tested for anaemia, vit B12 and the Vit\u00a0\u00a0D group.If you are on meds for the diabetes, it is important to get your liver and kidney function done once a year and also your B12 levels.Another thing that you can consider getting checked out is for parasites and worms.\u00a0\u00a0A stool test would be done for that.Ensure that you eat properly and drink plenty of water - dehydration can also make you feel unwell.Another thing to keep an eye on is your waterworks and any fungal problems on the skin.For period pains, you can try Evening Primrose oil.",

            "answer": "Thank you very much for your advice and suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0I'll bring those up with my doctor so I can be tested for them.As for my sugar levels, I am working on keeping them controlled.\u00a0\u00a0It's difficult as I've always been classified as brittle.\u00a0\u00a0I have started a tracker, though, and hope it will help.I see the doctor often, so I know my blood pressure is normal, I did have anemia for a time, but that was resolved.\u00a0\u00a0All but my Vit D was normal, and I'm taking supplements for Vit D.\u00a0\u00a0As for kidney and liver and B12, I get those checked on a regular basis - at least every 3 months.I haven't considered parasites or worms.\u00a0\u00a0I'll have to ask my doctor about those and see if there's a possibility that I have them.I do have a hard time remembering to drink water, but I've also started a tracker for that, so I hope to improve that as I track other things.Evening Primrose oil ... I've never heard of it, but I'll certainly look it up if it can help with the pains.Again, thank you.\u00a0\u00a0You've suggested things I hadn't considered, and that's what I'm looking for.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate the time you took to read and answer my questions - as long as my explanation is.",

            "answer": "I would suggest going to an internist. They look at all symptoms and all body systems and rule things out that way. I know what its like to be frustrated and have no answers!! You can do it! You have to be your own advocate and find an internist or another doctor that finds out what's wrong with you!",

    "question": "Hello, I am a 24-year-old Caucasian female.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with diabetes at 11 years old (I am classified as a brittle diabetic) and Mononucleosis at 15, which is when my health really started to decline.\u00a0\u00a0I started having issues with nausea (without throwing up - body fights it like the devil), consistent dizziness, and intermittent stomach pain.\u00a0\u00a0At 17, we took most processed sugar, tomatoes, and gluten out of my diet, which seems to help somewhat.\u00a0\u00a0Then at 18 I was diagnosed with diabetic induced Gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0I was also experiencing moderate depression and anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0The depression worsened at 22.\u00a0\u00a0At 24 I was formally diagnosed with bi-polar disorder II that leans toward depression and the anxiety has worsened to the point that it's beneath the surface of everything I do.\u00a0\u00a0I was soon after diagnosed with Endometriosis for which I had surgery.\u00a0\u00a0We thought that was what was causing the nausea and possibly the dizziness and stomach pains as it was, as the surgeon put it, \"one of the most severe cases he'd seen in a 24 year old.\"\u00a0\u00a0However, all the symptoms from before the surgery remain.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot work.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot stand for more than a half hour without feeling sick.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot walk for more than 15 minutes without getting nauseous and dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0I'm dizzy when I stand up and sometimes even when I'm simply sitting.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot sit up straight for more than an hour before feeling nauseous, dizzy, and having abdominal pain and/or discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0I started out only needing to recline, but now must take to lying down for hours at a time to lessen the abdominal pain/discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0Because of the pain/discomfort and nauseaI am unable to sleep well; any kind of pressure on my abdomen makes the nausea and pain/discomfort worse, even a simple elastic waistband.\u00a0\u00a0There are many things my doctors have ruled out, but we don't seem to be getting anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0I need help.\u00a0\u00a0My life is broken and though I try and try to pick up the pieces it just seems to fall apart all over again with every increase in the severity of my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know, nor do my doctors know if these symptoms and conditions are all connected or separate.\u00a0\u00a0What can be causing this?\u00a0\u00a0Is thereanyway these things could be connected to something being wrong in my brain?Please help.\u00a0\u00a0I'm so tired of being sick.\u00a0\u00a0I'm worn out - physically, mentally, and emotionally.\u00a0\u00a0Except for appointments, I never leave the house.\u00a0\u00a0Please, if there is anything anyone can tell me that might help, any answers, even if it's only things to look for or run tests on, let me know as soon as you can.I do apologize for the length of this.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure of what's relevant andwhat's not.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you to whoever reads this for your time, and especially for those who offer suggestions and possible answers.",
