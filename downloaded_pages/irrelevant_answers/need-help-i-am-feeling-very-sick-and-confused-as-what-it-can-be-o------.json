    "question": "Hello everyone. I am in my 40's and recently diabetic for the past 5 years. I am taking diabetic, high blood pressure and cholesterol medications. Lately for the past 4 weeks I have been feeling tiredness, fatique and low energy in the mornings or at noon time on and off but everyday its gradually getting worse and worse.Lately I have been feeling fatique and like passing out at work, especially after 10 am every morning or so. My blood pressure is on the high side and my sugar slightly over 200. I notice in the mornings I am peeing foam in the toilet and never seen that before. Not sure if thats a indication of some health problem. I need professional advice on this matter because I am confused at to what this is. Your answers will be greatly appreciated since I am not feeling well today. Thanks in advance.edit: Last week I visit the diabetic nurse for this matter and she told me to eat a mid morning snack for possible low sugar, low energy. The diabetic nurse did say this could possibly be something else and that I may have to see another doctor for this worsing illness. Thanks.",
