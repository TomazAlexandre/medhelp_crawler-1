            "answer": "Unfortunately, the Total T4 is considered obsolete and of little value, because a lot of that T4 will be bound by protein and unusable. Unfortunately, your doctor neglected to test Free T4, which would tell us what is actually free to be converted to T3, which is the hormone, actually used by the individual cells.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, there is no Free T3 result, so it's impossible to tell what's really going on.I'm not an expert on ultra sound, but it doesn't seem overly alarming.Some of your symptoms correlate with hyper, some with hypo and still others with diabetes.Have you been tested for thyroid antibodies?\u00a0\u00a0Or diagnosed with either Graves Disease or Hashimoto's Thyroiditis?",

No other features suggestive of clinical abnormality are present in the reportDue to elevated T4, it is good idea to test blood flow in the gland as well as do a blood test for TSI antibodies. (high blood flow combined with high TSI antibodies may raise suspicion of Grave\u2019s disease)",

He thinks that my symptoms are due to my cholesterol in which he called me in a RX for pravastatin 20mg which I am skeptical to take. I'm only 29 and do not want to take this stuff forever plus all the side effects!I still feel like there is something else going on with my thyroid and the nurse said he probably will not do anymore testing on it!!!",

In the upper/mid right lobe is a tiny sonolucent ( allowing for technical artifact) focus measuring approx. 3mm in diameter; probably tiny cyst.No other focal nodule is seen. There is no adjacent lymphadenopathy.What does this mean????I been having insomnia, headaches, anxiety,depression, cant lose weight, throat sore, hot, thirsty, shaky,tired, irritable, ...Please help!
