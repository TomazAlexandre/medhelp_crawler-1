            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.There is a condition called meralgia paresthetica. It is a sensory disturbance, usually painful and burning, located on the lateral aspect of the legs. The burning sensation is usually worsened with prolonged positions. The nerve that supplies this region courses through muscle and between tight ligamentous areas. These make it susceptible for compression.. Treatment includes neurontin and lyrica. Other options may include a neurectomy (surgical procedure).I recommend that you be seen by your PCP. He/she may wish to refer you to a neurologist.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi jb,Sorry you're in such pain. I'm no doctor so this is just reflecting experience with my own pain. I have peripheral neuropathy and the pain your're describing sounds very much like neuropathy. I get that pain through my buttocks, legs and into my feet. My neuropathy is from diabetes and I think excessive surgery I had to have in my 20's and 30's.You should really see your GP and ask for her/his assessment and then a referral to a Neurologist who will be able to test further, and order tests that your GP isn't authorised to order.Good luck with it,Rhian",

            "answer": "Hi. I'm not a doctor either, but I did see a few medical shows that reminded me of your symptoms, ascending numbness that felt or became paralysis? Accompanied by a burning sensation. It was transverse myelitis. I hope you don't have that. I have no idea if that's it, of course, but I would go to a neurologist for sure. Good luck!",
