            "answer": "I don't know the exact spelling but it sounds like you might have a \"theochromocytoma\" (probably sic)!! It a cyst on the adrenal gland that CAN produce the symtoms similar to yours.It can also cause flucuating B.P.,cold sweats,dizziness, It is a very RARE occurence to have a \"theo/phyo\". It can be diagnosed by an IVP\u00a0\u00a0(x-ray) and by a urine collection (24hrs).I would advise you to see a good internist ASAP regarding your problem..good luck",

            "answer": "HELP...I cant seem to ever post a freaking question here and I have been trying every day for a MONTH!!!.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 23 alcoholicwho stoped drinking 5 months ago due to a pulsing pain in the lower/middle right side of my body. At first it did radiate to the left side and to my back. I have had blood tests and even an ultrasound and they turn out normal. My physician thinks its Fatty Liver but im not convinced. I have been abstanant from booze for 5 months and still suffer the pain. I recently took some Roxicet pills and had a complete relapse, the pain was terrible\u00a0\u00a0and I belive it could be related to the pill. Im sick of suffering and would like some positive diagnosis. I need to feel like my absitinance from alcohol is worthwhlile and the pain has only caused me depression and frustration.\u00a0\u00a0HELP",

My symptoms are somewhat similar to yours but not hypoglycemia induced nor irritable bowel thus far.\u00a0\u00a0My MD needs quite a bit of convincing before authorizing specialized tests and referrals.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, why was a colonoscopy performed?\u00a0\u00a0I have read, and been informed, that these are done primarily when\u00a0\u00a0blood is found in the stool.\u00a0\u00a0(I have not had blood in my stool, however, my feces are discoloring recently - lighter.)",

    "question": "I am a 35 year old female and for the past three years I have experienced constant lightheadedness, fatigue, difficulty concentrating.\u00a0\u00a0These symptoms worsen after I eat foods with sugar or high in carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Almost immediatly after eating even a small piece of candy I can feel a reaction. I have seen an endocinologist and diabetes was ruled out. She also did a cortisol test which was negative.\u00a0\u00a0She concluded I probably have reactive hypoglycemia with an underlying problem that she could not diagnose.\u00a0\u00a0I then saw the gastroenterologist who performed a colonoscopy and later an endoscopy, both normal.\u00a0\u00a0He feels that since my sensitivity to sugar is a result of gastric dumping and is trying to slow down my digestion.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking 10mg of Bentyl three times a day.\u00a0\u00a0It just makes me more tired, although it has helped my irratible bowel.\u00a0\u00a0I have read about insulin producing tumors and am wondering if this could produce the symptoms I am having?\u00a0\u00a0Any information would be appreciated.ThanksMonica",
