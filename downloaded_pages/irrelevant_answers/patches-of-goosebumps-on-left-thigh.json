            "answer": "Hello,Such tingling feeling can be due to diabetes, vitamin B 12 deficiency, thyroid and neurological and spinal causes. Even dry skin and thyroid disease can cause such symptoms. We need to confirm the diagnosis by getting your blood sugar levels, EKG heart, Liver function tests, thyroid function tests, vitamin B 12 levels and a neurological examination from a neurologist done.You should eat a healthy diet consisting more of meat and non veg products which are rich sources of vitamin B 12. If you are a vegetarian then you can take vitamin B 12 supplements after consulting your physician.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": ".For the past year I have had a regular reoccurring patch of goosebumps on my left thigh. I get a tingling feeling and can see the patch of skin with goosebumps raised on it. The patch is the size of my hand roughly.It doesn't seem to be food related and it happens at all different times\u00a0\u00a0and is not dependent on my body position but its always on my thigh.I don't feel stressed at the time, it can happen in bed or when I am watching tv or driving. Its not painful just a creepy feeling.My doctor told me its a nerve misfiring.I am 34 years old and have had two natural childbirths and no significant surgeries or illnesses.I regularly attend the gym and I am fit and the correct weight.I am worried this could be linked to MS. My father has recently got nail psoriasis, skin pigment issues and a non functioning thyroid ( He has been told its all to do with his immune system attacking itself) I am hoping this is not linked its the only health issue my relatives have.I recently had some bloodwork done for a routine health check and everything was ok.Please post your experience if you have had similar issues or got a diagnosis.",
