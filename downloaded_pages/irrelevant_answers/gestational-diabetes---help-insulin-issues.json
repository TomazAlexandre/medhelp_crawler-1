            "answer": "Hi. I am 17 wks and have had gd since i was about 13 or 14 wks. And my doc just put me on insulin Tuesday.My levels varied, between 100 to 150, mostly being higher in the morning.Now it's doing about the same, except a lil lower. Your dr is probably seeing u every wk now? So just tell him on your next visit. I don't feel any different, my dr said he may have to increase my units i take if it were still high.HAve you been keeping to your diet?",

            "answer": "I have gd as well im 30 weeks pregnant and picked it up at 28 weeks I had gd with my first pregnancy as well got tested at 20 weeks with 2nd which was fine but not at 28 weeks I was a bit bummed as I wanted to try a vbac but have no choice know its a c section at 38 weeks. I have to keep my levels under 5 before foods and 8 after foods or ill have to be put on insulin sometimes I would go over the 8 after meals I would drink alot of water and in a few hours my levels were back to normal. at least you dont have much longer to go just think it will all be worth it in the end. Good luck.",
