    "question": "Ok, so yesterday I went to the doctor and took a pee test for pregnancy and for a UTI/bladder infection... both came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0Well, the doctor is sending me to get a blood test done today to find out if I'm pregnant, or have diabetes or something else.\u00a0\u00a0I began spotting yesterday after a little romp in the bedroom.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still spotting, however I have a panty liner on, and there are no visible spots on it, I only see the pink when I wipe after urinating. Then last night I had a BM and\u00a0\u00a0it seems to be lasting longer, but still there is none on my panty liner, and only when I wipe.\u00a0\u00a0I am now two weeks late for my period, sure I just give up and assume this is my period?\u00a0\u00a0Or should I go get the blood work done just (I'm being negative like everything else lately) to hear the doctor say I'm not pregnant???? Please help!",
