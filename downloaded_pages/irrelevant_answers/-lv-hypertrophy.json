            "answer": "Thanks doctor, no history of HCM whatsoever, only thing in the\u00a0\u00a0family is hypertension and some diabetes, my mother is nearly 75 , father nearly 80 and grandparents on both sides lived to 89 & 93. I was concerned because the cardiologist told me to see him in 2 years , I was supposed to in July but other things arose and Iwon't be able to see him til probably august next year.Thanks for the reassurance.",

    "question": "I've been diagnosed with mild LVH of the IVS, all other dimensions within normal limits last echo\u00a0\u00a0in mid 2005 showed an IVS of 14mm EF 55% no leakages of the valves, the cardiologist describes the jets as perfect whatever that means, I was in rush to catch a flight back and forgot to ask, though he assured me that I don't have HCM. I was mild hypertensive for years but is controlled with atenolol 100mg daily cozaar 25mg twice daily and HCTZ 12.5mg daily, BP been averaging around 105/65 for couple of years now. In 2001 echo showed borderline LVH with dimensions ofthe IVS 10mm to12mm, with an of\u00a0\u00a0EF 65-70%, same cardio , same echo machine. I was supposed to get an echo this year but due to unforseen events had to skip, Do you think with the info provided its is reasonable to wait another year? I'm 43 years old male and been a sufferer of tachycardia & PVcs all my life but all test was negative including echo, stress test and holter , I rarely have PVCs anymore and no tachycardia at all, Does the diagnosis of Mild LVH put me at any significant increased risk for Sudden cardiac events? I also have ankylosing spondylitis, do you think that could be a contributing factor for LVH?, I know it can affect the aortic valve and conduction systems in a small % of persons with Ankylosing spondylitis. Thanks for your time and Happy New Year.",
