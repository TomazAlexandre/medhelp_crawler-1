            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Increased bilirubin levels may indicate liver or kidney conditions and it is important that further tests are done. Generalized itching can also be an associated symptom of the liver problem. However, other possible issues may also be considered like diabetes, anemia, irritation, allergy and skin conditions. Do keep us posted with the diagnostic test also. Take care and hope to hear from you.",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for the update. What other diagnostic tests were done already?\u00a0\u00a0It is good to hear that the results were negative and this indeed rules out any liver pathology. Skin biopsy may help determine if the cause of the itching is due to infectious organisms. You would also benefit from doing this test to identify the possible cause. Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hi,There are different techniques of skin biopsy and these are used in different situations. Clear this first with your attending physician and discuss which type will be performed. This could be a shave biopsy, wherein a thin slice off the top of the skin is removed;a punch biopsy, which takes a small cylindrical fragment of tissue from the area of interest;and an excisional biopsy, which takes a larger and deeper skin sample. With regards to pain, a local anesthetic is often used.",
