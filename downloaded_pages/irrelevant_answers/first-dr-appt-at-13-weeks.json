    "question": "So I had my initial appointment today, got a bunch of information, got my blood work ordered & because of the stupid backwards bmi chart, I had to get a glucose challenge. I waited 8 hrs to take it so that I could fast, but I'm afraid that wasn't enough. Did any of you mommies have to get an early challenge? When you did do the glucose, did you fast or did you eat?",
