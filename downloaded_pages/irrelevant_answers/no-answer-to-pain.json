    "question": "Five years ago I started experiencing numbness of my feet, but also a severe sensitivity of my foot soles. It has become more severe over the years and now my hands also have this numbness. My fingers are dumb\u00a0\u00a0at doing small things. Turning pages is difficult, treading a needle is almost impossible. Lately I have trouble with bladder control and permanent muscle pain which is worse when I get up in the morning or when I drive and get out to walk.Every time. I ask a doctor about this he rests me for diabetes and when the results come back it is never followed up.What specialist (medical) will be able to help me.I'm tired of being ignored - I'm not a hypochondriac and has always handled pain well. I know something is wrong and it is getting worse.I am 52 years old, work full time as a school teacher.",
