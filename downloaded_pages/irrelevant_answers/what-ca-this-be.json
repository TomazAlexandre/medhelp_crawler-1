            "answer": "Hello,Constipation can be due to many causes.They include slow passage of digesting food through any part of the intestine like irritable bowel disease, diet low in fiber, over-use of stimulant laxatives (e.g., senna, castor oil, and certain herbs), hypothyroidism and hyperparathyroidism(by raising the calcium levels in the blood), intestinal pseudo-obstruction, Hirschsprung's disease, Chagas disease,colon inertia(nerves and/or muscles of the colon do not work normally) and pelvic floor dysfunction(the muscles of the lower pelvis that surround the rectum (the pelvic floor muscles) do not work normally).Can you identify any of them?Extreme fatigue can be due to stress,lack of proper sleep,improper diet,anemia, low blood pressure, diabetes,depression and narcolepsy.In my opinion,you should get yourself tested for diabetes,Hb deficiency(anemias) and throid disorders.But first of all it is important to consult a physician and discuss the above stated possibilities with him.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.",

    "question": "I have constipation for a long time. No matter what I eat my body has trouble breaking it down.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with I rritable Bowel Syndrome. For the past two years I have been tired all the time. I can't exert myself physically to much or my body will give out on me and I wont be able to move around because of feeling lightheaded and dizzy. If I exert myself to much I will pass out possiblely. A couple times I fell to the ground on\u00a0\u00a0my butt. I have never had the digestive problems until the past three months. I have been to the GI specialist. I'm also anemic slightly. Some people said it sounds like I could possible have Diabetes. I don't know if I should get tested for that.",
