            "answer": "Hi Shars:I managed to lose about 100lbs with the metabolism of a reptile. I started off eating 900 calories a day, because I didn't bother to count them until later, and started with three days a week at the gym. The workout took me two hours and I started with 20 minutes on the treadmill at a pace that was an effort to maintain, and the rest was weights.The first few weeks, I did not lose any weight. I then upped my caloric intake to 1200 calories a day, and the gym to five days a week, and the weight slowly started to come off. I should say I really had to push myself at the gym. If the treadmill became easier, I made it hard again by increasing the speed or incline.Even with my FT4 levels normal, I still have the metabolism of a reptile.",
