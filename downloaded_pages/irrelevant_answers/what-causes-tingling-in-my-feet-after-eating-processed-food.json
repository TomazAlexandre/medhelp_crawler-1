            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0tingling in feet after eating tinned food could be attributed to food poisoning which is caused by infectious organisms and illness caused by chemicals. Symptoms can vary from nausea followed by forceful vomiting, frequent diarrhea, painful cramps, fever, dizziness and tingling in hands and feet. So it would be prudent to consult a physician to check your stool specimen and evidence of the organism. If there is no suggestion of poisoning, you need to consider vitamin B 12 deficiencies, diabetes, hypothyroidism and rheumatoid arthritis. Hope this helps. Take care.",
