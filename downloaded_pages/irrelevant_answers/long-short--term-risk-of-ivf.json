            "answer": "This is a question that you should discuss with your IVF providers. By and large, IVF is safe for the woman. There are procedural risks at the time of retrieval, of bleeding, infection, and complications of anesthesia. These are uncommon, but your high BMI places you at greater risk. If you successfully conceive, then approx 1/3 of all IVF pregnancies are twins, less than 5% triplets, and any multiple gestation places you at greater risk for gestational diabetes, high blood pressure in pregnancy, cesarean section which in and of itself has greater risks with high BMI.For the most part, IVF is safe; safer than being pregnant in fact.However your question is complex, involves a discussion of risks to you, risks to the pregnancy, discussing the small but significant relationship between IVF and obstetrical complications, IVF and imprinting disorders in children conceived from IVF, and the increased risks that occur when the pregnancy is a twin pregnancy or greater. The very nature of the discussion is part of the informed consent process. Therefore I strongly encourage you to have an in depth discussion with your IVF provider as you try to decide.",
