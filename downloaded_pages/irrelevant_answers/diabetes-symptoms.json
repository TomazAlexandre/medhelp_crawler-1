            "answer": "Hi,Very simple.\u00a0\u00a0Just go to your doctor and asked to be tested for FBS (fasting blood sugar) and HA1C - which gives an idea of your blood sugar over the past 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0Target FBS would ideally be 80 - 90 (though they don't consider it diabetes until about 120), and HA1C should ideally be 4.7 (again they normally don't consider it diabetes until about 6.1).\u00a0\u00a0If you are higher than Ideal and less than diabetic, would still be a great idea to get serious about the lifestyle measures (weight management, diet, exercise) that will prevent it progressing and normalise blood sugars.Read as much as you can and get educated on what you can do to manage it.Then take it from there.",
