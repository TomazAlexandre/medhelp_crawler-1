            "answer": "Yeah, I agree there\u2019s not too much you can do to change your blood glucose results if you were fasting already. Aside from introducing meds, that is.Keep in mind that things like white bread, most pasta, potatoes, things like that tend to elevate blood sugar quickly. In place of those, consider whole grains and sweet potatoes/yams. And of course, sugar and hidden sugar/corns syrups etc.Fasting sugar should be 125 mg/dL. Non of these values mean much with one test, but if repeated tests show problems, it\u2019s time to address this.I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2003; it\u2019s not something you want to deal with if it can be avoided. Plus, insulin resistance can be a negative factor for managing HCV/achieving SVR. It can be done, but it makes it more difficult.Be sure to discuss these results with your primary care doctor, and take whatever steps are needed to nip this in the bud. Are you overweight? Any history of diabetes in the family?Good luck with the immediate results; I hope they accept you to the trial\u2014Bill",

            "answer": "I have noticed that my morning sugars go up if I didn't get a good nights sleep the night before... from 96 to 124. I also found out that even a couple sips of black coffee will alter the results... I forgot that I wasn't supposed to have anything... so had to re-do.",

            "answer": "Hi Bill,No, there is no hx of DM in my fam, but I am overweight. And you are right, I do not want to have to deal with diabetes on top of everything else, but my blood sugar does run high. I hope it does not disqualify me from the study, but if it does, I will have to try, try again right?To All;I'll update when I get results back from Tuesday's test. Thank you for the comments.",

    "question": "Just got a call from the study people. Have to go back and have my blood drawn again after a 12 hour fast because my blood glucose was outside the parameters of acceptability for the trial study. I could be disqualified because of it. The only problem I have with the information is the fact that I had already been fasting for the last blood draw so I don't see that it will be any different this next time. I'll update after results are in next week. (I don't go back to retest until Tuesday next week.) Thanks for listening.",
