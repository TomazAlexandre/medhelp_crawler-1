    "question": "HI, im 23 and at this point wiegh 405 pounds. I am diabetic as you probably can guess by the wieght. The problem is I exercise and eat a decent diet. Due to the diabetes I have to allow myself some sugar or I get very ill. What do I do metformin didnt work for me. I want to lose the wieght because I would like to have a child...My other symptoms areI either have no period and then then when i get one 1 to 2 months later I am basically bed ridden from the pain. When i do get them regulary I have migraines and severe cramps, bloating, extreme swelling of feet ect. Sometimes the bleeding will last more then a week. I have had one as long as a month... any advice",
