            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Most pineal gland cysts are asymptomatic. Those that are large cause neurological deficits, visual loss etc. Hence it is unlikely that your symptoms are due to pineal gland. It is possible that you have compressed nerve in the cervical region or that you have thoracic outlet syndrome due to narrowing of space behind the collar bone causing pressure on major arteries and nerves. This could be responsible for the tired or heavy feel in the arm. Apart from this get yourself tested for anemia, hypothyroidism, low blood pressure, depression and diabetes.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Your symptoms may indeed be neurological in nature and may need to have further evaluation done. Shingles subsides within 3 to 5 weeks, and the blisters often leave no scars.\u00a0\u00a0Post herpetic neuralgia is also common after effect of shingles. have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Take care and regards.",

(Seasonal Affective Disorder) which makes me tired a lot, especially since I live in one the cloudiest parts of America.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if it would help you or not, but I've found lights that, differing from ordinary lights, actually mimic the sun have been an enormous blessing from God for me.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe they can be for you to!",
