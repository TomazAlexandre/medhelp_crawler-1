            "answer": "hi daisi, if kidney function test, blood pressure and blood sugar are within normal limits, there is no need to start low dose lisinopril. If there are other risk factors present like obesity, strong family history of hypertension or diabetes leading to kidney damage then one might think of starting low dose ACE inhibitors. I personally feel that in your father's case even if there are some risk factors, still monitoring of KFT, blood sugar and BP should be done initially. In kidney function tests, one should look for the creatinine value and presence of proteins in the urine before starting ace inhibitors.",
