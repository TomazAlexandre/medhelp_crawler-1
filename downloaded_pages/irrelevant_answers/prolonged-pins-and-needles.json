            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The numbness, pins and tingling could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness, pins and tingling of little and ring finger. If other finger tips are also getting involved then it is generally due to nerve compression or a nerve disorder. Depending on which finger it is, it can be carpel tunnel syndrome, compression of ulnar nerve, compression of radial nerve. Diabetes or hypothyroidism too can be the cause. Very cold climate, peripheral vascular disease, panic disorder, leprosy, alcoholic neuropathy, compression of cervical spinal nerves, are the other causes. It is difficult to comment beyond this on net without examining you and a detailed history. Please consult your PCP to begin with and get a referral for a neurologist.",
