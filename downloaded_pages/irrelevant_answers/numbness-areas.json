            "answer": "Hello,I would definitely see a doctor about this. The symptoms you are describing sound like the result of damage to the nerve supplying the muscles which control your bowels and bladder. The causes for this are many, and include things like physical damage, damage to the spinal cord, problems with the blood supply to the nerves and solid structures pressing on the nerves like a slipped disc.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hello,Tingling sensation of the penis can be due to anxiety, contact dermatitis, traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes, prostatitis, genital herpes, urethritis and STD\u2019s like Gonorrhea and Syphilis but they are less likely in your case.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwears. Also apply a mild steroid cream on the penis. If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
