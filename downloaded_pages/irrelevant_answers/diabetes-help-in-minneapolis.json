            "answer": "Dear kevinsreell,Thank you for contacting JDRF. I'm so sorry you are dealing with so much.My son was diagnosed 19 years ago at the age of 8. I know how frightening it is and hope you have a good support system.\u00a0\u00a0It helped knowing I wasn't the only one out there.As a volunteer, I would highly recommend speaking to his doctor as soon as possible. He/She should be able to make a statement or refer you to someone that can. Your correct about the vital need to test blood sugars. Maintaining good control is very important for his future health. How old is he now?I live on the west coast and have a few calls out.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to do some research to see if I can find more information.In the meantime, keep watching this tread as others will probably post comments. I will post again tomorrow.Best Wishs,dm",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply. My son David is 12. His doctor is in South Dakota about 220 miles away. I talked to her today, but I don't think she is going to be a lot of help. She wants to try talking to my ex-wife again to get things straightened out. I was at a Dr. appointment when they \"scolded\" her and my son for not keeping up with testing, shots, etc... I feel like I need the help of a local healthcare provider for support. Our hearing is this coming Tuesday, so I need to act as soon as possible. I've kept logs and have coppies of medical records.Thanks for your help!Kevin",

            "answer": "Dear kevinsreell,Thank you very much for the added information.\u00a0\u00a0As A volunteer, I can't recommend a specific doctor but I am sending you to a web site that I believe will be a big help.The American Associations of Clinical Endocrinologists or AACE at www.aace.com. They should be able to give you the names of Physicians in your local area. Within this web site type in (http://www.aace.com/pup/pf/index.php) This is a Intensive Diabete Self-Management System.\u00a0\u00a0This includes a contract between the patient and doctor emphasizing that diabetes care is the responsiblity if both.I hope this helps. I know how difficult your life is right now. Especially in your situation.I know from my own experience that when a person is diagnosed he or she usually goes thrugh a grieving. Denial, fear, and anger, etc. Counceling helped. Jesse has a team of Dr.s nurses, and nutritionist.If we can be of further assistance, please don't hesitate to contact us . Please keep in touch. I would like to know how your family is doing",

    "question": "My son was diagnosed with type one over a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0His honeymoon period ended a few months ago.\u00a0\u00a0His A1c has risen steadily for the last 6 to 8 months and I am concerned with what's happening.\u00a0\u00a0He lives primarily with my ex-wife who has been diagnosed as Bi-Polar Manic Depressive.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having a very difficult time getting her to monitor my son's testing and shots.\u00a0\u00a0He has skipped them for days at a time and his last A1c was up to 9.5.\u00a0\u00a0I filed an order of protection with the county to try to get some action taken, but I think I need a local health professional to make some kind of a statement about the dangers of poor testing and control, at a hearing in about a week.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know of someone in the Minneapolis/Saint Paul area who can help?\u00a0\u00a0I'm afraid if I don't get this turned around very soon, there will be devastating consequences.",
