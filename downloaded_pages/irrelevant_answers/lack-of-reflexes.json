            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?Any reflex action requires a stimulus, a sensory pathway, a link with a motor unit, a motor neuron, and finally, a contractile or other effector element. Any breach in this arc results in an absent reflex.Reflexes of legs and feet includes, knee reflex and ankle reflex.Reflex being reported 0 suggest either there is pathology of peripheral femoral nerve or there is a concern with segmental innervations of L3-4.Peripheral nerve pathologies can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency, dehydration or nerve compression.Concern about segmental innervations could be due to Lower back strain.Venous stasis or local haemotoma is what is indicated by purple color mottling.Hope this helps.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi thereSorry Caliber's answer was a bit technical for a numbskull like me but at my last neurological test the neuro was surprised at my complete lack of reflexes in the ankle and hardly any in the knees. I thought it was all a part of the MS but she said she would have expected an MS patient to have reflexes.I was diagnosed with MS many years ago after an MRI and years of various symptoms (mostly sensory) but now she is sending me for an LP. Does this mean she doubts the diagnosis?I don't want to go back to Limbo.Any thoughts?",
