            "answer": "Yes, I fill tired and drained all the time and I can't sleep. I have heard that both beta-blockers and statin drugs will cause Diabetes. I have been pre-diabetic for a long time and am starting to get symptoms of type 2 diabetes. My doctor has been ordering blood tests every 3-6 months to see if I need to go on medication to prevent Diabetes. I have been testing my glucose levels every day and they are in the low range of Diabetes. I am so sick and tired of taking pills that make me feel like I am not myself. I am always, tired, weak, have muscle pain, I have headaches daily, I have leg cramps, I have memory loss, I have vision problems, I have pain and neuropathy in my feet.",

            "answer": "Well you're in luck, because I take both Metoprolol as well as a Statin, so I can give you some advice.200mg of Metoprolol wrecked me, and I'm a very active person usually.\u00a0\u00a0It felt like I was walking in concrete shoes.\u00a0\u00a0Every step was an effort, and any physical effort caused a heavy weight feeling in my chest.\u00a0\u00a0My heart just wouldn't get up to speed.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately I was on that dose for about 3 weeks before my physician and I cut it back to 100mg.\u00a0\u00a0At that dose, I could function normally again and it was effective.\u00a0\u00a0Here's the thing about the strength you're currently on.\u00a0\u00a0Metoprolol has a half life of around 5-7 hours.\u00a0\u00a0What that means is if you take a 100mg tablet of Metoprolol Tartrate, within 5 to 7 hours, half of the drug has been metabolized, and you have approximately half the level remaining within you.\u00a0\u00a0I assume that you take your daily dose approximately 12 hours apart.\u00a0\u00a0So in 12 hours, when you take your second pill of the day, there remains a small amount in your blood from the first pill.\u00a0\u00a0You keep repeating this day after day, month after month, and what happens is you begin to build a level of drug that is much higher than what was intended for you.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if physicians think of this when they prescribe dose levels for a patient.\u00a0\u00a0I now take 75mg daily (25mg in the morning, and 50mg at night) and find that I function fine at this level.\u00a0\u00a0I had been on it for about 5 years in an attempt to control a rapid heartbeat issue that I had called SVT.\u00a0\u00a0It was also extremely effective in controlling my borderline hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0I eventually had a procedure to fix the SVT, but stayed on Metoprool fo the hypertension, and I'm remain on it today, but on the 75mg now.\u00a0\u00a0If I feel that the drug is beginning to build in my blood, I just stop a dose for a day or two.\u00a0\u00a0This give my body a chance to metabolize the excessive buildup of the drug.Statins... OK..I was probably borderline before I started it.\u00a0\u00a0Taking it probably pushed me over the edge.\u00a0\u00a0I control my blood glucose by diet alone now.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't seen a backed potato or a large plate of pasta in years.\u00a0\u00a0I eat a Paleo diet, and that seems to work for me.\u00a0\u00a0But once a diabetic, always a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0There is no cure, only control.\u00a0\u00a0Still, my physician says that it's better to have borderline blood glucose than high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0My total cholesterol dropped from 220 to 135.\u00a0\u00a0My wife is in the same predicament, except where I take 20mg of Simvastatin per day, she takes 80mg.\u00a0\u00a0She also has type II diabetes but controls it with Metformin, and a slightly reduced carbohydrate intake.\u00a0\u00a0I firmly believe that statins contribute to diabetes but I continue to take it.\u00a0\u00a0It has been proven that I cannot control it by diet alone.",

            "answer": "BY the way... I forgot to add that beta blockers like Metoprolol no longer first line treatment for hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0They've been replaced with more modern drugs.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, you and I still take it.\u00a0\u00a0For me, it's effective and cheap; literally pennies per dose.\u00a0\u00a0Not so with the newer drugs.\u00a0\u00a0However, they could benefit you though, so it's worth it to ask.",
