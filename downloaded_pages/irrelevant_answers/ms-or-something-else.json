            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with your doctor.Without the ability to examine you and obtain a history, I can not tell you what the exact cause of your symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.The symptoms you describe of memory loss, tremors, confusion, burning and itching, and pins and needles, bowel and bladder problems, and the several other symptoms you describe are difficult to tie together into one diagnosis, and several possibilities exist. While the symptoms you describe do occur in patients with MS, the presence of these symptoms does not necessarily support the diagnosis of MS, which is diagnosed based on specific clinical and historical points, specific MRI findings, and sometimes ancillary testing. The MRI finding you describe in and of itself (without other abnormalities) would not support the diagnosis of MS per se; the MRI would need to be taken into clinical context (by the ordering physician, not the radiologist).Pins and needles in the hands and feet with tingling could suggest neuropathy; a neuropathy of the autonomic nervous system (the part of the nervous system that controls heart rate and blood pressure) could also cause the bowel and bladder symptoms. Evaluation for neuropathy includes EMG/NCS, a test which assesses how nerves conduct electricity and how the muscles respond. Some neuropathies (called small fiber neuropathies) do not show evidence of abnormality on MRI but are rather diagnosed by other types of test. Treatment of neuropathy is treatment of the underlying cause (such as diabetes) and treatment with medications for neuropathic pain (such as gabapentin/neurontin and pregabalin/lyrica).Spinal cord disorders could also lead to extremity symptoms with bowel/bladder symptoms; if a spinal cord disorder is suspected based on history and examination, then further testing could potentially include an MRI of the spine.Some disorders that can cause multiple symptoms in multiple body parts such as in you include thyroid problems, certain vitamin deficiencies (such as vitamin B12), diabetes, and others (some of which it sounds like have been ruled out in you, such as autoimmune disorders).Having gone over those possibilities, when a person has so many symptoms similar to the ones you describe, often one of the few diagnosis that can tie all these symptoms together is depression. Often these symptoms may reflect emotional/psychiatric problems related to stress (what is called somatization disorder). The latter is a true medical condition whereby instead of a patient experiencing depression or anxiety, they experience physical symptoms, and once the stress is addressed, the symptoms resolve. Fibromyalagia is certainly another possibility when there are diffuse pains and other symptoms without a clear cause; it is a true medical condition that leads to whole body pains, and is best treated with medications such as lyrica and neurontin, exercise, and physical therapy.If you have not been evaluated by a neurologist this is recommended; after he/she examines you and obtains a history, he/she can determine whether there is a peripheral nerve or spinal cord problem, or for that matter a problem with the nerves at all.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "I have been suffering for years, seen many different doctors and still no answer.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if this might be MS or what else it could possibly be.\u00a0\u00a0I am have put as much information as I could.\u00a0\u00a0I have suffered from tremors, all over my body, loss of memory, confusion, burning, itchy pins and needle feeling down the back of my legs, balance problems, bladder problems(not making it or feeling like I have to go but then cant when I get there), bowel issues (constipation), tinnitus, weakness in my legs, brain fog, dizziness, severe fatigue, tingling in legs and feet, burning sensation in feet, swallowing issue (feel like things get caught in my throat, squeezing sensation over my chest and probably some other things I forgot. I need to add that I had a neutral Babinsky and failed Romberg, again.I do not suffer from diabetes, high BP, have never had a stroke, they have ruled out connective tissue disease as all blood work was normal.My MRI impression was : 3mm focus of chronic white matter ischemic change within the right periatrial white matter tracts , this impression was from the radiologist who had never seen me boefore, he actually never even spoke to me.Any help you could provide would be so helpful as I have been dealing with this for so long, since 2000, so any advice in which direction I should be going would help a lot.",
