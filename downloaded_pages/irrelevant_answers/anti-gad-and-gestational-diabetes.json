            "answer": "Hello,I'm not familiar with anti-GAD and Stiff Person Syndrome (SPS).\u00a0\u00a0But what I've come across regarding SPS notes an autoimmune process was originally postulated to underlie this syndrome since the disorder often occurred in conjunction with a variety of autoimmune diseases including thyroiditis, vitiligo, pernicious anemia, and (particularly) type 1 diabetes mellitus.\u00a0\u00a0However gestational diabetes is associated with the development later in life of type II diabetes (not an auto-immune process, but the due to insulin resistance).\u00a0\u00a0So I think these are two very distinct processes at work and it would be hard to predict how the two will interact with respect to your diabetes risk immediate postpartum or later in life.Best regards,Dr. Downing",
