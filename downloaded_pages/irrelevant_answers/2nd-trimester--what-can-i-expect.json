            "answer": "i'm seeing the doctor every 4 weeks still (i'm almost 27 weeks). the third trimester starts at 28 weeks. during the second trimester you'll go for your anatomy scan at around 20 weeks, and if you want, you'll have an opportunity to learn the sex of the baby. Towards the end of the second trimester, you'll have your glucose screen to check for gestational diabetes (mine's on monday). you'll start feeling the baby move in about a month. i started to feel very scattered, light movement around 16/17 weeks, and began to feel more definite movement in weeks 18 and 19 (although i have read some don't feel it til later). you're gonna pop, and start getting huge :) and towards the second half of the second trimester you're going to start packing on the pounds.i've had a great second trimester- lots of energy and feeling great. i hope it's the same for you!!!! only negatives are heartburn (but i take a prescription for that), and it gets rough to sleep. i recommend getting a snoogle sooner than later. i got one last week, and i wish i had it sooner. oh yea- and my feet just started to swell like crazy, but i guess that's from both the heat and being 26 weeks.",

            "answer": "I am at 19wks now. With normal pregnancies you go to the doctor about every 4wks, unless you are high risk, like me, then its every two wks. I haven't had a whole lot of issues so far. I had some bad heartburn in the beginning, but with medicine I got it to go away. You get bigger of course. Sleep becomes a challenge because the baby will let you know when he/she is uncomfortable. I sleep propped up on about 4 pillows lol. I felt 1st movement at 16wks and nothing again till 18wks. Now at 19wks I feel movement every now and then, usually atleast once a day. I just can't wait in a few more wks it will be much more distinct. Uhm.... other than that. Yeah there is the big scan at around 20wks. Mine's actually at around 21 1/2 weeks. Any other questions just ask us.... Congratulations and welcome to 2nd trimester!",

    "question": "Hey ladies, I am 14wks today!!! Whoo hoo!! I just have a couple of questions, what can I expect from my first trimester, how many times will I go to the doctor during my second trimester, is it still once a month or every two weeks? How long is the second trimester? Will I feel the baby move? I am so sorry for all the questions, I am just a little excited, because I was nervous in the beginning, about losing the baby. Happy Mother's day to all!!!!Thanks for any advice, and all those who are still TTC, keep trying don't get discouraged!!!Thanks ladies....",
