            "answer": "If you fail the three hour, they make you see a person about your diet and you have to check your blood sugar four times a day. Once when you wake up before you eat, once an hour after you eat breakfast, once an hour after lunch and once an hour after dinner.You have to do that the rest of your pregnancy as well as avoid and eat certain foods.BUT try asking your midwife if you can do the blood sugar checking or a week INSTEAD of the three hour test. I didnt want to do the three hour so my midwife let me do that instead. If by the end of the week my blood sugar was normal and healthy then I dont have to be deemed with GD. And plus the way I went is actually more accurate than the three hour test.",
