            "answer": "Hello,One of the possibilities for your symptoms is Raynaud\u2019s disease. It is a vascular disorder that affects blood flow to the extremities which include the fingers, toes, nose and ears when exposed to temperature changes or stress.I feel that a consultation of a physician will be the best. Other causes of cold and blue peripheries like diabetes, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid also have to be ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Every time I take a shower my palms turn blue. It seems to be darker blue at the base of my thumbs, but my whole palm is bluish. I am a 55 year old woman with no medical problems and I am not on any medications. I do not have this problem at any other time except in the shower. What could be causing this?",
