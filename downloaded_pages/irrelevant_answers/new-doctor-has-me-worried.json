            "answer": "Measuring big isn't necessarily a bad thing unless they think it's from a medical issue like diabetes. My cousin started measuring big with her last pregnancy and the Dr just kept telling her baby is measuring big and she had no medical issues wrong with her she just had s big baby. Her baby came out at 9lbs 3oz. So it's possible you just have a big baby nothing wrong with that good luck",

    "question": "I switched doctors because my aunt who is a obgyn works there and wanted me to switch so id get better care.Yesterday was my first appoinent there. The nurse when getting my b/p and temp asked if i switched because of diabetes (sp)?? I told her no because my aunt works here...that scared me a little right there. I was 178 pre pregnancy weight (i think) and im 197 now at 21 weeks and 4 days. The doctor check the heart beat which she said was around 150 which is good she said. Then she was measuring fundemental height with a tape measure and said hmmmm the baby is measuring big. I told her that at my last ultrasound he measured a week early (big). She asked if ive ever had fibroids...i told her not that i know of. She told me to try not to gain anymore weight which i dont think i look like ive gained that much. Should i be concerned? My husband was 9 pounds 8 oz when he was born.",
