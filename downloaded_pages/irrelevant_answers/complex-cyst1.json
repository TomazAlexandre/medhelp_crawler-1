            "answer": "Ohhh, complex cyst and family history (especially with anaplastic which is very aggressive and hereditary) are very good reasons to have it out.\u00a0\u00a0However getting it checked every 3-6 months (I'd recommend every 3 because of the type of cancer) is an option too.What do you want?\u00a0\u00a0Can you sleep at night (like the surgeon asked) because you are worrying and wondering?\u00a0\u00a0Realize too that ultrasounds can be unreliable for tracking the size but they can show any significant change.\u00a0\u00a0Anaplastic spreads quickly (that's why I'd lean towards the every 3 months ultrasound):\u00a0\u00a0http://www.endocrineweb.com/caana.htmlIf it shows it has spread, at all, you need to get your thyroid out ASAP.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to treat anaplastic is to treat it immediately and very, very aggressively.You are far younger than the usual age of onset for anaplastic but there are many of us here who just don't follow the rules when it comes to thyroid disorders, so please keep an eye on it.My best to you,Utahmommapapillary carcinoma '03 and three sisters with the same (non-hereditary) cancer",

    "question": "I recently was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at 33.\u00a0\u00a0My endo ordered an ultrasound of my thyroid and a complex cyst 10mm was found,\u00a0\u00a0I know that these are common, however my father died of anaplastic thyroid cancer at 51.\u00a0\u00a0It was believed to have been follicular cancer that went undetected for several years as they found follicular cancer as well in his biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0The original biopsy done on him was negative for cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned? The surgeon said she was unable to biopsy the nodule due to it being too small.\u00a0\u00a0She offered to take it out if I couldn't sleep, but recommende an ultrasound in 6 mths.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound reasonable.\u00a0\u00a0I am very hyper sensitive due to what happened to my father.",
