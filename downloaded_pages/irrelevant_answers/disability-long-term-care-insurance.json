    "question": "What is everyone's experience with getting (private) disability insurance?I'm currently un-dx, but with clinical sx that support a dx (so far no lesions on MRI).\u00a0\u00a0I first saw an MS specialist 6.5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I'm currently seeing an MS specialist now (in a different city).\u00a0\u00a0I've seen recommendations to get private long-term care/disability insurance if you suspect you have the disease, but are not dx yet.What is this process like?\u00a0\u00a0I can't in good concience lie, but currently my only (relevant) dx is complicated migraine (I also have celiac disease but am on a GF diet).Part of me is having a really hard time even thinking about getting long-term care insurance because I can't stand the thought of being disabled (who can?)--put I\"m also somewhat of a pragmatist and think it might be the right thing to do.Any thoughts?Stephanie",
