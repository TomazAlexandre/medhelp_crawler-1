            "answer": "The most recent says:Scattered punctate areas of white matter T2 hyperintensity involving the juxtacortical portions of both cerebral hemispheres are comparable in appearance and distribution. These are 2-3 mm in diameter. There is no parenchymal enhancement on post contrast images. No subdural collection or hydrocephalus. No discrete lesion identified in the corpus callosum.Conclusion:1. Stable abnormal MRI with multiple bilateral juxtacortical white matter T2 hyperintense lesions without gadolinium enhancement or diffusion abnormality.",

            "answer": "Hi!Scattered foci of increased T2/Flair signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines. Please discuss with your treating doctors. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

    "question": "There are stable punctate nonspecific foci of high T2 and FLAIR signal in the left and right frontal and parietal white matter with several new punctate foci since the 2004 examination. A focus about the left frontal horn of the lateral ventricle is similar. There is no restricted diffusion. There is no abnormal parenchymal or meningeal enhancement. The pituitary gland is not enlarged. There are no bony abnormalities. The paranasal sinuses are symmetrically aerated.Impression:1. Scattered small nonspecific punctate foci of high T2 and FLAIR signal frontal and parietal white matter.2. Several new lesions since 2004 examination. These are nonspecific.",
