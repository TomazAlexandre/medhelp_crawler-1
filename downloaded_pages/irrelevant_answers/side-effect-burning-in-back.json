    "question": "Has anyone experienced burning in the lower back while taking Levothyroxine?I've been taking Levothyroxine since December (so about 6 months) and my dosage has been adjusted a couple of times. A few months back, I started to notice a burning sensation in my lower back, but I didn't think much about it at the time. But the burning has continued to flare up. I have since gone to a couple doctors to have it checked out - and so far, they agree it is not muscle related, x-rays and urine tests have been clean. One doctor suggested it may be a side effect of the medication. So, I have done an ad-hoc experiment - and sure enough, when I stop taking the medication, the burning goes away within a day and does not return -- until I start taking the medication again. But my doctors are baffled, because this is not a listed side effect. My question is: has anyone else experienced this type of symptom while on Levothyroxine? If so, did it turn out to be something else that was being aggravated by the medication, or was it the medication itself that was causing it? (One doctor is wondering if it's nerve-related.) I have found very little on the Web about this. Thanks!",
