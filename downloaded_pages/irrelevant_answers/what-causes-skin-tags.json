    "question": "My daughter has had skin tags on and close to her vagina for the last 4 years. We have seen 2 different gyn. and had them removed and tested, the results have been the same.... not warts or any other form of STD's. They really bother her in the form of embarrassment. No one has been able to explain why or what she could do to rid herself of these \"skin tags\", can anyone clue us in. The Dr.'s have removed them by freezing,burning,chemical, and cutting them off, they have been sent to 2 completely different labs with the same results being returned no STD. She has also used the high dollar cream for warts, followed the directions to a T and nothing changed. She is very frustrated at the return each time, and this has cost us about 3000.00 to only have to go back and have them removed again. Is there anything someone might know that could help her rid herself of this embarrassing problem?",
