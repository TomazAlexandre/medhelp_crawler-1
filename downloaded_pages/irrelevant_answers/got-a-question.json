            "answer": "To answer your question,Yes. There are many issues one can face when they have been diagnosed with diabetes. One of the most frustrating is memory loss. Memory loss can occur in most people as they age. But sometimes, memory loss can be due to circulatory problems and hormonal changes in the body.To prevent memory loss when a person has diabetes, one should change their diet to include foods with fiber, protein, and calcium that will stimulate blood flow and also help replace some of the nutrients lost. Exercise will also promote blood flow. Walking is an excellent exercise that does not put excess strain on the body, joints or limbs and helps to reduce glucose levels.",
