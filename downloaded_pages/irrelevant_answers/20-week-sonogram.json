            "answer": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0Did your regular OB do the u/s or a perinatologist?\u00a0\u00a0Reason I ask, if you are over 35 and are at your stage of pregnancy, your Ob will usually recommend a Level II u/s or \"Targeted study \"which gives a more precise reading of your baby's measurments and growth.\u00a0\u00a0Apparantly, there are different levels to u/s and what they detect, so when you go to your regular OB, readings are pretty general, basic, nothing high definition...Level II is more defined and able to give you a better indication of your babies overall developement. Don't worry, relax and try to enjoy...and keep us posted!",

            "answer": "I know you are nervous, but be glad they did not say they found some any abnormalities with your baby. Sometimes they do get in positions that make it hard to measure certain things.The technician at our 20 wk ultrasound could only see two vessels on the umbilical cord and there should be three, so right away that made them afraid there might be more problems. I was sent to a university Medical Center three weeks later that had more detailed ultrasound equipment. Babies with the two vessel cord can be perfectly normal, but they were being extra cautious because of my age (51).\u00a0\u00a0Having the second ultrasound did confirm the two vessel cord, but no other problems were found.We were then given an appointment with a pediatric cardiologist for an EKG for the baby because of my age and because if there was a heart problem I would have had to go to their hospital for the delivery with a pediatric cardiologist nearby. Her heart looked fine. If the baby's heart is healthy, there's a lot less chance the baby has any genetic problems.",
