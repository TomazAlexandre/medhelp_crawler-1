            "answer": "Hello mky6If your semen is infected it may not always be due to prostate.Is there a smell in the semen? This could signify infection of semen. Infection could be due to infection of prostate, testis, epididyamis etc.I need you to take two simple tests--one is semen analysis for any infection, and the other is stool routine and microscopic for any worm infestation.I understand you hold the itch around anus related to ejaculation, but it may not be so. Please consult your GP or physician either with the reports of the tests or else without them.Also if you are a diabetic or if you have a family history of diabetes, please get your sugar tested too, for infections are common in diabetics.BestDoctornee",

    "question": "I am a 30 yr old male a little concerned with the issue I have been having.\u00a0\u00a0It seems as though after I masturbate in the\u00a0\u00a0evening, when I wake in the morning and have a bowel movement, I have an itch all that day in my anus. A little ointment does ease the itching.\u00a0\u00a0I have no pain whatsoever and I have no urinary problems, just an itch.\u00a0\u00a0It has been going on for at least a month now and I just figured out under what circumstances the itching is caused.\u00a0\u00a0If I do not masturbate and ejaculate that day or night, no itch.\u00a0\u00a0I have been researching and researching.\u00a0\u00a0I dont think it is a dietary issue, otherwise I would assume I would have a itch all the time. Is this a prostate issue?",
