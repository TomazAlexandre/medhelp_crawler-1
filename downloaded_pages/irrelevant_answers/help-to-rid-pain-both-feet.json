            "answer": "Without examining you and reviewing your history and tests I cannot make a clinical diagnosis. You have stated that your doctors feel this is a peripheral neuropathy. That would be a reasonable diagnosis. A peripheral neuropathy involves the dying back of the nerves, and typically starts in the feet. The most common cause for this is diabetes, which can be tested for. A EMG (muscle/nerve test) can confirm this diagnosis. Other causes which should be excluded include problems with B12, Folate, and thyroid function. In many cases a cause can not be determined, and treatment of the symptoms is recommended. The most common treatment for the pain is gabapentin (Neurontin). This is a medication designed to decreased the severity of the symptoms. Another possible medication is amytriptiline. Good luck.",
