            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The most probable cause for tingling hands and feet is neuropathy, a disorder of the nerves. Most common cause is diabetes. This happens with metabolic disorders, vitamin deficiencies, infections and traumatic injuries. It may not be an allergic reaction. The tingling and wheezing need proper evaluation by your GP, please consult him for a respiratory and neurological assessment.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your wishes. I just wanted to update saying that it has gone away. My doctor stated that it was due to anxiety or nervousness, since I do suffer from that sometimes and the rashes are due to dryness in the skin. I don't really drink alot of water but I'm starting to and also I am exercising everyday. I just have another question. Even though I'm fine, I have this sharp pain on/around my shoulder blade. It's sharp sometimes, but not too much that doesn't disrupt my movements (not too much). I have been weight training and I think I have pulled the tendon too much or caused some nerve damage. What are your suggestions?",

    "question": "Last night I was watching tv and all of a sudden I felt a tingling sensation around my hands and arms. It felt slightly tingly but not too much and so I scratched a few times when I felt a burning sensation all around my body... And I tried switching clothes and as I removed them, I felt that it was sensitive and was hurting me. I don't know what it is and then I started wheezing a little bit too... So I just slept it off and woke up with the same feeling the next day. Is it possible that I'm allergic to my dog & cat or probably some dust? What can it be? What medications can help me with this?",
