    "question": "Hi All,I would really appreciate if some one could take time to shred some light on the condition that my mother is going through. She has been lately diagonosed with diabetes and is on medication currently.She has been developing rash on her neck and face. Also, complaining about her eyes itching. I have already consulted my primary care about this today about 3 hours back and he has recommended a urine sugar test as the glucose level in her blood is not very high but pretty much in control. However, slightly above the diabetes benchmark. But, the glucose level in her urine is high and it shows some thing like \"++++\" on her reports.I am very concerned if it has some thing to do with the end stage renal disease / Kidney failure.My question to you is -1. Does this mean that her kidneys have been damaged completely?2. How do I control this disease for her?ThanksMike",
