            "answer": "Hi,FBS of 150 is dangerous. What is your level 2 hours after eating?\u00a0\u00a0I pressume it is very high.\u00a0\u00a0What is your HA1C?\u00a0\u00a0You haven't given us a lot of information.Have you talked to your doctor about this?\u00a0\u00a0What is his recommendation.\u00a0\u00a0Definitely be guided by your doctor.I would think that a combination of medication and major lifestyle changes (diet and exercise and weight management) would be called for. It may still be possible just with diet and exercise, but that would depend on what your current situation is.Get educated on diabetes - there is plenty of very good information about appropriate diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0You have diabetes and if it is not well managed it kills, and not prettily.Best wishes",

In the USA, or most English speaking countries, you can not go to the corner drug store and buy diabetes medication unless a doctor has filled out prescription. A doctor needs to analyze your diabetes test scores then he/she will recommend a medication, a dosage and how often it must be taken.\"CONTROLLING MEANS WHAT ?\"GIYF [Google Is Your Friend] - http://tinyurl.com/controldiabetes\" IS IT POSSIBLE TO BRING DOWN TO 100 THROUGH LIFESTYLE CHANGE.\"Yes but not in all cases. Read through the numerous threads on this forum. You must be held accountable for your weight, nutrition, and exercise. If your levels have been in the danger zone for long periods of time, medication will help but may not bring it down to normal levels. Now its up to you to practice 'control' so it [your blood sugar] doesn't continue to rise and/or stay above normal levels. Read up on diabetes side effects.
