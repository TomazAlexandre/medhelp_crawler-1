            "answer": "Hello,It is very rare for a wound to persist for so long. It can be infected. Keep it clean and apply Neosporin ointment and avoid messing with it. However culture of the wound needs to be done to confirm the nature of antibiotics to be prescribed. For this confirmation needs to be done first for which you need to consult your doctor. Also get his blood sugar levels checked as diabetes can often cause such delayed healing of wound.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello, and thank you for your opinion. Our child is just under 2 yrs old. He has scratched his forehead a few months ago and the wound takes forever to heal. Usually his scratched would heal overnight. You can see high resolution photo of the wound here:http://i1210.photobucket.com/albums/cc401/oooliya/dermatology.jpgWe visited pediatrician several times to get more and more antibiotics, including:SMZ-TMP SUS (he took it daily for approx. 7 days)Mupirocin OinmentClindamycin Gel (we didn't use it that much).I phoned a doctor from out of area that we know (presently we are in Miami, FL) and after explaining what had happened and what the wound looks like and drugs that were prescribed he told me the antibiotics will not help. He suggested to simply use betadine(iodine) we use 10% solution. It seems to dry up, but when the iodine is washed away in the morning you can still see it doesn't look good (please see the photo above).Thank you for any feedback and suggestions.",
