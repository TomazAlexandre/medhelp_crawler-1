            "answer": "I don't quite get the poll questions. I will say that I went undiagnosed with Hashimoto's for a long time because my TSH of 2.69/2.74 was 'normal' and so no further thyroid tests were ordered.I have personally interviewed six endos in my town of San Antonio (the second highest diabetes mortality in the country) where most endos see diabetes patients all day long. Five of the six endos believe that TSH is primary in testing and treating thyroid disease.That's scary.I, too, found a wonderful endo off Mary Shomon's website. He is who treats me now, and I'm doing much better. He treats my symptoms and my frees, not my TSH.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "Doctors are like car mechanics. You can keep airing up a leaky tire to 32 psi or you can patch the hole even though many tire manufactures now say to patch a hole is all of a sudden a liability, so don't do it.Doctor #1 (1997), and #2 (2006) said my TSH levels are good with synthroid so my symptoms must not be from Hoshis hypo. They also said that people who feel good on dessicated need a psychologist, and med schools say not to use it.\u00a0\u00a0In 2007, I googled thyroid endlessly, and don't listen to those two.Doc #3, (2008) Endo on About Thyroid.com list, better, was open to all hypo meds, but still used tsh as med roadblock.Doc #4 (last month) said, \"so those other docs just blew you off hu?\" I treat symptoms not #'s, would you like to raise your meds sometime and see how it goes? Hole-in-the-wall MD office.I met him by mistake. Wow.",
