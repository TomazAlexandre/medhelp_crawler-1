            "answer": "I would have to agree with WaveRider.\u00a0\u00a0This should be discussed with you doctor.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, you could do damage to your pancreas, kidneys, liver and heart if you start experimenting and get your glucose level too high, as consistently spiking your levels.I am scared of diabetes as I recently lost a good friend because of it.\u00a0\u00a0First he lost his eye site, then his left foot, left leg, his right leg and then his life and he did not experiment with the insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I saw my doctor yesterday and he is happy with our progress and I would not consider altering the program he has established.Good luck and be careful.Millard",
