            "answer": "Your Free T3 is at a good level in that range.The TSI test is negative for Grave's, although the result is a little bit high. 50 would be better, but less than 129 is nagative. Most people have thyroid antibodies in small numbers, which is why they consider 109 negative and 130 positive.I don't think your Free T3 is high enough to make you feel hyper, and your TSH does not look hyper.It may be an adrenal problem.",
