He says that when he stands up he gets a head rush and his vision, starting with his peripherals and working in, slowly darkins. He says it only last a few seconds but he is very worried. I don't know if it has anything to do with it but he gets a tingling sensation in his hands and feet on a normal basis and they fall asleep very easy. Does anybody know what this is?",
