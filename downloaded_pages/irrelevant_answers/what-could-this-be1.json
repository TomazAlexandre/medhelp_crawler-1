            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You could be having smoker\u2019s lungs. This also causes phlegm with black particles. Asthma is an allergic condition and can happen in response to an allergy to smoke.\u00a0\u00a0You could also be having this. Chronic cough and removal of phlegm can cause extreme weakness and lethargy. Drink plenty of fluids to keep yourself hydrated. Also other causes like anemia, diabetes, thyroid disorders, chronic fatigue syndrome etc will have to be looked into. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Take care!",
