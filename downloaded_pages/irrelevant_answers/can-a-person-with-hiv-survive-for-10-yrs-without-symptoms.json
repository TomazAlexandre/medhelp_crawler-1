            "answer": "I was a LTNP. I went 21 years being positive, didn't need medication. No illnesses or anything until my CD4 crashed inbetween labs. So the answer to your question is yes, some people go without HAART meds for that length of time and longer. The thing is you need to be tested and continue being tested. It's not like you don't have HIV, your body just doesn't require it to keep the virus in check.",

Single exposure 10 years ago, the chance of the guy he had sex with 3/100 (which is probably an exageration), no symptoms for ten years 1/40,000, and the exposure crisk as 1/200 if the guy he was with is infected, makes it impossible. I said he needs to test, I also said expect a negative! I haven't contradicted Teak in anyway. Why are you being so testy Today!",

    "question": "Hello Everybody,when i was 16, i was to one of the Gays pubs in london and went too much drunk. A guy did a unprotected sex with me for 10 mins and then i realised, what i was into and left aside, went home quitely. I didn't do any penetration/unprotectex sex with him. Now after 10 yrs- i am 26 and still had no sexual encounter after that. I am about to get married this yr and i have in the back of the mind of the encounter that had occured to me 10 yrs ago when i was gng through one of STD journal. I am complete honest and dont want to put my GF in any case of trouble. I havent touched her till now for a oral sex also. My love is honest and sincere. Is there any need for me to give my HIV testing before getting married as its been 10 yrs now. I have gone through no symtoms. Not even a flue/fever from past 6 yrs. I have got fever after 2/3 yrs after encounter but soon went off. I have gone through all the blood tests but not HIV. Need a sincere advice.",
