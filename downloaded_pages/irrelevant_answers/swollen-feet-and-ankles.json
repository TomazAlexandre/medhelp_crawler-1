And they've swollen up all of a sudden mainly the right side. Im hardly ever on my feet and do drink lots of water. Also last night I had the longest shower of my life and I keep myself very cool at home with fans and all. So i guess it is something to call in for.\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks again lovely mommies.",
