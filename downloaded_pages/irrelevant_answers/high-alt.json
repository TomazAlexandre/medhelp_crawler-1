            "answer": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver diseaseTreatments and drugsBy Mayo Clinic staffNo standard treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease exists. Instead, doctors typically work to treat the risk factors that contribute to your liver disease. For instance, if you're obese, your doctor will help you to lose weigh through diet, exercise and, in some cases, medications and surgery. If a medication is causing your fatty liver disease, your doctor will try to switch you to a different medication.Lifestyle and home remediesBy Mayo Clinic staffAlong with your doctor's help, you can take steps to control your nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. You can:* Lose weight. If you're overweight or obese, reduce the number of calories you eat each day and increase your physical activity in order to lose weight. Aim to lose one or two pounds a week. If you've tried to lose weight in the past and have been unsuccessful, ask your doctor for help.* Choose a healthy diet. Eat a healthy diet that's rich in fruits and vegetables. Reduce the amount of saturated fat in your diet and instead select healthy unsaturated fats, such as those found in fish, olive oil and nuts. Include whole grains in your diet, such as whole-wheat breads and brown rice.* Exercise and be more active. Aim for at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week. Incorporate more activity in your day. For instance, take the stairs instead of the elevator. Walk instead of taking short trips in your car. If you're trying to lose weight, you might find that more exercise is helpful. But if you don't already exercise regularly, get your doctor's OK first and start slowly.* Control your diabetes. Follow your doctor's instructions to stay in control of your diabetes. Take your medications as directed and closely monitor your blood sugar.* Lower your cholesterol. A healthy plant-based diet, exercise and medications can help keep your cholesterol and your triglycerides at healthy levels.* Protect your liver. Avoid things that will put extra stress on your liver. For instance, don't drink alcohol. Follow the instructions on all medications and over-the-counter drugs.Alternative medicineBy Mayo Clinic staffNo alternative medicine treatments have been found to be helpful in treating nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.Vitamins for liver protectionResearchers have studied vitamin supplements for the treatment of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, but results have been disappointing. In theory, vitamins called antioxidants could help protect the liver by reducing or neutralizing the damage caused by inflammation. But studies of vitamin supplements haven't supported this.The safest way to increase the antioxidants you get is to eat more fruits and vegetables. If you're interested in vitamin supplements, though, talk to your doctor about the benefits and risks. Large doses of vitamin supplements could interfere with medications or cause other complications.See:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/nonalcoholic-fatty-liver-disease/DS00577/DSECTION=treatments-and-drugsMike",

            "answer": "dmw319 said: \"I have always been diagnosed with a fatty liver\"dmw319 asked: \"What can I do to lower the ALT. I am not drinking any alcohol.\"I answered her question.You posted possible causes of ALT elevation and then suggested supplements and dietary choices. I said nothing about any of that. While the Mayo article cautions against antioxidant vitamin supplements, that was not the reason for my post - nor was that fact that you posted yo the thread.You neglected to mention what is often the primary approach to Fatty Liver.Loose weightWhat I did post was what the Mayo Clinic suggests for patients with FATTY LIVER because that is what she said she was diagnosed with. I thought that the Mayo Clinic's take on Fatty Liver was quite appropriate. That is why I posted it Bob.Mike",
