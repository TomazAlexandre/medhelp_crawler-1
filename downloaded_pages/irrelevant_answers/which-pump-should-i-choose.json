            "answer": "Scottlaw,Hello again, Scott.I'm a long-time pumper, but haven't used either of those pumps.\u00a0\u00a0All the current ones are quite good and users of each model are usually delighted with them once they learn to use them.A few things to investigate 'in general' once you learn the features of each.\u00a0\u00a0WHich one has the most-available training?\u00a0\u00a0How about the cost/availabilty of the supplies?This organization is run by & for pumpers:http://www.insulin-pumpers.org/It has many links and lots of good information.Here is a site with info about most available pumps:http://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes_technology/insulin_pump_models.phpWhile it is a commercial site, we're not endorsing any of the products or services they may sell.\u00a0\u00a0The site does have good information.There is also a great discussion board hosted by Harvard's Joslin Diabetes Center with a section on pumping: http://chat.joslin.harvard.edu:8080/~diabetesFinally, I highly recommend a book to help you understand the fundamental concepts of glucose management.\u00a0\u00a0It's valuable for NON-pumpers, too!Pumping INsulin by John Walsh & Ruth Roberts.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's in its 4th edition now and you should be able to find it for under $20 or at your local library.Pumping can be terrific because once we learn the processes, we have much more flexibility and control over insulin delivery.\u00a0\u00a0Many achieve better glucose control for less effort/sacrifice.\u00a0\u00a0It does take commitment to learn, and it takes good insurance support to afford.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "I have been to the doctors twice last week and I have another appointment on Monday to talk about getting a pump...I have been offered 2 pumps the Animas 2020 or the Paradigm with real-time glucose checks...I was skeptical about the pump but as I read on this forum and others they seem to only have good comments. Has anyone used either of the pumps I can choose from?",
