            "answer": "An EKG is not a very reliable source to determine heart tissue damage.\u00a0\u00a0Because scarred tissue (previous MI) causes more resistance than normal tissue the wave length (measure of time) is longer for the area in question.\u00a0\u00a0But there can be other reasons for delay of a specific wave form so it requires further testing.\u00a0\u00a0An echo would be appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0I believe the statistics for an EKG is about 20% for a false positive.It is possible to have had a heart attack (MI) some time in the past (no way to determine when, just new or old) and not be aware, especially if one has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0About 4 years ago I had a silent heart attack and was VERY surprised to hear I had damaged heart cells.\u00a0\u00a0Medication has been very beneificial.\u00a0\u00a0You should not be a risk for a knee operation, and I'm sure they will go forward with the operation after confirming or ruling out any past heart condition.",

            "answer": "I really appreciate your feedback. I'm following up with cardiology tomorrow and anticipate he will be doing an echocardiogram. I'm glad to know that your medications are helping you. Was there also other interventions you went through such as cardiac catherization? I'm also thinking ahead in case I need to go to some type of cardiac rehab and its long-term effectiveness.",

    "question": "I'm a 57 y/o female, weight is 225. I had a pre-op ekg for minor surgery on my knee. The EKG came back as abnormal, possible inferior wall infarct, age-untermined. Surgery has been cancelled because of this report. I have a history of high blood pressure which is normally in control with my medications. I don't recall ever having any type of serious chest pain in the past. I do tend to become short of breath with activity, especially with climbing stairs and going up hills, but I tended to relate this to my weight and being very out of shape. How far back do the findings of \"age-undetermined\" go? Is it months, years? I havn't had an EKG in quite some time, so there isn't anything recent to compare this one to. I'm really upset about these findings since this is something that just surfaced with my pre-operative testing. I'm going to follow-up with a cardiologist- this is very overwhelming for me now, can't even think straight.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/251940\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/251940</a>.",
