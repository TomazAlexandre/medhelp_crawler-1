            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A lump in armpit can be a swollen lymphnode, in response to fungal infection or sweat dermatitis or infection of hair follicles. It can also be an enlarged lymphnode due to malignancy of breast (rare in males but not impossible). At times it is a cyst too and this can get infected. Consult your PCP for an evaluation. A CT scan can be confirmatory or a fine needle biopsy. Treatment can vary from wait and watch to anti-inflammatory along with antibiotics to excision of the lump. Check for diabetes too as high sugar often results in repeated infection and boils. Take care!",

    "question": "I have a small bump in my armpit that I have had for years. Ive always thought it was an ingrown hair as I could squeeze it and pus comes out in two spots. Its embarrasing but it smells bad when i squeeze it and if I dont squeeze it, it seems to just smell like BO. So I am constantly appling deoderant on and always washing my clothes so much. What is your thoughts on this. I want to get rid of it but have been to embarrased to actually see a doctor for this. Ive always thought it would go away.",
