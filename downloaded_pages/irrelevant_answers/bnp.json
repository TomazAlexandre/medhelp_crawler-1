            "answer": "B-type Natriuretic Peptide\u00a0\u00a0(BNP) is a substance that leaks from the lower beating chambers in the heart in a response to a change in pressure which indicates the presence and severity of heart failure. Your number of 233, although higher than the normal limit of 100, is still fairly low and does not yet suggest mild heart failure. It's like being pre-diabetic, you don't have diabetes yet but there is evidence that the condition is present. This usually the result of an increased amount of fluid or high pressure inside the heart. There are drugs and lifestyle changes that can correct these issues.To put your number in perspective, below is the breakdown from the Cleveland Clinic;BNP levels below 100 pg/mL indicate no heart failureBNP levels of 100-300 suggest heart failure is presentBNP levels above 300 pg/mL indicate mild heart failureBNP levels above 600 pg/mL indicate moderate heart failure.BNP levels above 900 pg/mL indicate severe heart failure.You should be working with your doctor to stabilize any issues that may be present which may lead to heart failure. There are several underlying conditions that can be controlled and cause your heart to improve. Although there is no life threatening worries right now, now is the time to start improving your cardiac health.I hope this helps,Jon",
