            "answer": "I am pregnant with my 7th child. I have been induced for my last 3 pregnancies, which all of them were born very healthy without any issues. I did not have any negative side effects either. Each time that I was induced, I was better prepared to deal with my schedule for my family and also helped me be better prepared for my pain. With my inductions, I felt every contraction from beginning into I couldn't handle any more... Then I would tell my doctor and nurses I am ready for my epidural whenever I'm allowed to get one. The contractions are always very painful for me but I just breath through them. Once the epidural is given, I am able to enjoy the rest of my labor",
