    "question": "I recently began\u00a0\u00a0running after not having done so for some time and after several runs - admittedly longer than was wise - I noticed that as I walk I feel like something is moving around under my left foot in the midfoot area.\u00a0\u00a0The feeling of movement occurs primarily when my heel has just left the ground and lasts until the foot is at an angle of about 30 degrees.\u00a0\u00a0The sensation is not painful and there are no noticeable changes in the foots capabilities or structure, though it feels like the arch is slightly lower to the ground. Any thoughts?Your help is very much appreciated.",
