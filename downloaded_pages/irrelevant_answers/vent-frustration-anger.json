Online as well there's suggested foods and amounts that won't affect you too bad. But hopefully you can get this fixed. Best wishes.",

    "question": "This whole gestational diabetes *****. It isn't eventhat. My sugar has always been I the prediabetic range and it still is. I didnt develop it. I understand I have to check my blood and watch what I eat but they gave me a glucometer and strips for like 1 day. I guess in the city of Topeka no one works with accuchek. Idk why they would give u an accuchek meter if u can't get accuchek strips. This was on thursday so by friday I was out of strips. I did some research and found a place that said they do do it. I went and they didn't. They ordered me some other glucometer and strips for that and said thay would call me Monday. They never did. My insurance called me and asked if I had them yet I said no and they started helping me find a place that covered and had the accuchek strips and we found one. BUT the diabetes educator has the perscription and the place faxed her to send it to them but she didn't. They called me and told me to ask her to do it and she told me no. Because she sent it to this other pharmacy already but then they switched the machine. She was really rude about it. So now I don't have strips.Idk how she wants me to follow up with her if she won do what I am asking her to do. I'm only trying to get what I need with what I already have. And my insurance was all for that. I'm just really stressing right now..",
