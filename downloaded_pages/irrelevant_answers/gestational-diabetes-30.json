            "answer": "I've just re-read all the info I was given on GD. The biggest concern is the size of the baby! As it can cause problems during labour and birth. These problems can be baby getting stuck, internal tearing or in the worst possible case featal distress possibly causing death. Future problems may be an obese child with a higher risk of developing diabetes. These are the main reasons for monitoring and treating GD. It is also common for a woman with GD to be induced or to be scheduled for a C-Section before her due date. Most GD cases the Dr will order a growth/measurement ultrasound to check the babies size. Sticking to an approved diet and monitoring your blood sugar levels are the most common ways to treat GD, but there are some cases in which tablets or insulin is needed.It is all about listening and doing as you medical care provider instructs you to do.I have GD and its given me the extra push to eat even healthier than I was.",
