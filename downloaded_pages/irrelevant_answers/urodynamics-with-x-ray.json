            "answer": "Hi there,How are you? Urodynamics are used to look at and study how the bladder and urethra work during bladder filling, with an increase on intra-abdominal pressure and during voiding or urination.\u00a0\u00a0The pressures in the bladder and urethra are measured during the study and flouroscopy (x-ray) is used to see the bladder and the urethra. In order to measure pressures, a small urodynamic catheter will be placed in your bladder. The catheter has three ports, or openings: one for bladder pressure, one for urethral pressure, and one for filling the bladder.You can learn more about this through this link: http://www.adclinic.com/Doctors_Specialties_maps/Urology/urodynamics.htmI hope this helps. Take care and keep us posted.",

            "answer": "The blood glucose test is ordered to measure the amount of glucose in the blood right at the time of sample collection. It is used to detect both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia, to help diagnose diabetes, and to monitor glucose levels in persons with diabetes.The urine glucose is seldom ordered by itself. At one time, it was used to monitor diabetics, but it has been largely replaced by the more sensitive and \u201creal time\u201d blood glucose.This checks for glucose in the urine sample using a dipstick made with a color-sensitive pad. The pad contains chemicals that react with glucose. The color that the dipstick changes tells the provider how much glucose is in your urine.However, there are drugs that that may increase urine glucose measurements:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Aminosalicylic acid, cephalosphorins, ,Chloral hydrate, Chloramphenicol, Dextrothyroxine, Diazoxide, Diuretics (loop and thiazides),Estrogens, Ifosfamide, Isoniazid,\u00a0\u00a0Levodopa, Lithium,\u00a0\u00a0Nafcillin,\u00a0\u00a0Nalidixic acid or Nicotinic acid (large doses).Other drugs also can cause false negative or false positive results, depending on the type of test strip used. I suggest you should talk to your doctor for proper evaluation and management.",

            "answer": "A random blood sugar test measures your blood sugar at any point in time, not necessarily a certain amount of time after a meal, snack or beverage. A normal random blood sugar level even if you've recently eaten and your blood sugar level is at its peak, shouldn't be higher than 200 mg/dL.A fasting blood sugar test measures the amount of sugar in your blood after you fast for at least eight hours or overnight.A normal fasting blood sugar result is lower than 100 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood (mg/dL).Whichever blood test you took, your blood sugar at this time is normal.Do you have family history of diabetes? If yes, healthy diet (if obese) and exercise will help prevent diabetes.I hope this helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "Thanks for sharing your medical history. one of the symptoms of diabetes is frequent urination and i agree with your doctor that you rule this out from the picture through testing glucose levels in your blood or urine. Like i said, the urine glucose is not used as before because it's sensitivity is not that good and many factors affect the result such as the medications i mentioned before. Your blood sugar tested 80 and it is below the 200 cut off so it's normal. Diabetes can be prevented by lifestyle modification such as exercise, diet and by not smoking, drinking alcohol or caffeine.The American Diabetes Associations recommends a\u00a0\u00a0blood glucose test every 3 years starting at 45 to check for diabetes.",
