            "answer": "Hi!Well, technically speaking, slimming pills do make you thinner, more haggard and unhealthy. They make you lose weight by suppressing appetite, causing indigestion, preventing absorption of nutrients, and other such drastic routes. Though you lose weight, the weight loss is not healthy. Yes, there are drugs to treat morbid obesity, which work more or less on similar principles but in a more scientific way, and are useful only in those really obese.Hence, personally, I wouldn't recommend any such pills. If you want to lose weight, then you must do it the scientific way for long term benefits, healthy glow, and a good physique and body. It's best to join a nutrition expert and a physical trainer and follow their advice. Incorporating yoga into this regimen takes stress out of this exercise to lose weight.What you also need to do is eliminate the common causes of increase in weight such as overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Anemia, low proteins, adrenal gland problems, kidney and liver problems and Cushing Syndrome has to be eliminated. Late night snacking and poor sleep patterns too cause weight gain. Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.If the above causes are eliminated then you can join a weight trainer and a nutrition expert and follow their advice and lose weight under their guidance. Take care!",
