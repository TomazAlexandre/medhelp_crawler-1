            "answer": "two penile implants exist.one is a rod that leaves you semi-erect at all times.the other is an inflatable pump.The indications for penile implant surgery include vascular disease, diabetes, bladder or prostate cancer surgery or for benign prostate disease, Peyronie's disease, neurologic disease, hypogonadism, pelvic fractures and impotence related to many medical diseases including chronic renal disease, alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, genital trauma, Parkinsonism, and drug therapyWhen choosing a penile prosthesis, it is important to recognize the major categories. These include:rigid, semi-rigid and malleable rods, which produce varying degrees of rigidityinflatable prostheses which include two types;a) the multi-component inflatable prosthesis, andb) the self contained inflatable prosthesis.The main objective is to leave the patient with a penis that allows achievement of sexual intercourse with no complications, when it is desired and in a way that satisfies both partners. There is no single penile prosthesis that is best for all patients so it is imperative that the urologist sit down with the patient and carefully review the risks, benefits, and drawbacks to each type.",
