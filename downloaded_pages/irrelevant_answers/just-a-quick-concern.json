            "answer": "Well, I won't lie, she is at risk. Diabetes is nothing to mess with, and I am sure hep c isn't either. A couple suggestions, you can try asking her to take a walk with you, see if she will drink sugar free soda (check on that, I don't know if that is ok for diabetics), and see if you can come up with some delicious healthy food to make her. Grilling food is way healthier as a rule than frying, or you can bake, but I am almost sure grilling is the best (eh, double check on that too).If she won't do any of these things, let her know you love her, and you want her to see a therapist and doctor. She does need help. I am not trying to scare you, but you love her and it's better to be safe than sorry.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Both diabetes and hepatitis have to be under control for your mom to feel 100% ok. Diabetes too can affect vision. Hence it is important to get a complete eye examination. She will have to learn to change her lifestyle to get proper cure. Enroll her with a good physical trainer and nutrition expert. Some counseling may also help. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi my mom has recently been diagnosed with diabetes and she also has hep c. Im concerned with her health, shes in her 50's and doesnt take care of herself. She rarely gets exercise and constantly only drinks soda and has a poor interest in healthy foods. She told me within a month of being diagnosed her vision is already blurred to where she cant drive her car anymore and is feeling sick. Not only that but her hep c has been making her upset also. What are the steps she needs to take to try and fix this? And how bad is her life at risk?",
