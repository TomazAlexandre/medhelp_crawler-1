            "answer": "Sorry to hear you fell, ouch!! That is always aweful.Well I'm no doctor, but those numbers sure look like diabetes to me, sorry to be a wet blanket. We'll have to see what your doctor says. You are slightly high apon rising, and the drop to 112 was with no food, right, before the test?So your activity getting ready to go, dropped you the 20 points. This is normal with a diabetic. Your body can't compensate for activity with no added carb, and you can drop low (this number wasn't low though)Then you had a large spike after being given the glucose and then faded back to normal -safe range after the sugar/carbs left your system.Jazzy",
