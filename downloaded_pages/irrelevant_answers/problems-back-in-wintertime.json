    "question": "Hey, i am Jonathan, 30, last year near November i expierienced what i thought was a spider bite in my room, i called the hospital on everybody i got told the swelling atop my foot was a ganglyon cyst and when they brung me back my knees reddened and i have a synovial cyst on the right side of my knee, i self treated for anything to help it heal, epsom salt mostly, i started getting muscle twitches in my foot, a distant non existant like nausea sensation in back of my mind, and insomia for like only three nights like my energy won't stop, i waited awhile while attending church, i searched massive information on the net until everything stopped, no fine tiny muscle twitching, non existant nausea, the insomnia eased after awhile tired after 16 hours back to normal, the only thing i noticed was excema and flaky skin and brown discoloration on top of my feet, peeling between toes, very mild not diabetes like, even pre diabetes, just lookalike sort of, because i bodybuild and ive never had things like this happen to me, the only thing i came up with is minor occasional smoking and poor circulation because i have smoked with friends and asked people for a cigarrette here and their, strangers and friends, my mother is a nurse at Tampa hospital and she just tells me silly things are caused the fasculations, i do cough and feel tiny heartburn feelings and strain on the throat though, the time passed the heat weather improving circulation then everything came back right around wintertime again its started driving me nuts again i sometimes rarely get full body jerks, i self disturb with analysis the tickling pins needles and the peely skin between my toes is gone and the chilblains only on my small toe have dissappeared totally, they arent tender to touch, i know what the hell came over me this winter like last winter, their is red sores on my lower legs, tiny micro sores, and the other thing that got my attention was mild leg weakening feeling, iv'e vowed to stop smoking as a mild kick period and ive lowered carbs in my diet and experiment multivitamins and supplements, below are some things i remember if you know what they mean about it i appreciate it,1: After a couple months back from hospital got leg cramp while bathing in shower2: Right leg weakened strangely while handling bike attending church3: When last year thought was spider bite had nightmares4: Before Christmas 2011 got shaky once in the bathroom in morning sorta like anxiety extreme5: After this New Years had a out of body expierience only in room and snapped outta it6: New Years wine weakened my legs, maybe the sulfites",
