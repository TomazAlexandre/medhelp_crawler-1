            "answer": "Hi!A lump in armpit or underside of upper arm can be a swollen lymphnode, in response to fungal infection or sweat dermatitis or infection of hair follicles. It can also be an enlarged lymphnode due to malignancy of breast (less likely but not impossible). At times it is can be a cyst too and this can get infected. It can be a boil or infection of hair follicle. A CT scan can be confirmatory or a fine needle biopsy. Treatment can vary from wait and watch to anti-inflammatory along with antibiotics to excision of the lump. Check for diabetes too as high sugar often results in repeated infection and boils. Consult your PCP for an evaluation by CT. Take care!",

Doctor sent me for Breast Exam two years ago when it wasn't too painful, nothing found.Just one month ago, had to get mole removed and sent for testing from my leg. All my bloods are 'normal'. But the pain in my arm is getting worse.Doctor says it may be a cyst on a nerve. Should I get a second opinion or does it sound like a cyst?Thank you for your help.",
