            "answer": "I found a question I and some other volunteers answered in the archives, maybe it could help you.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if you might be frustrated at the moment because of your diabetes and the restrictions and limitations we sometimes encounter.\u00a0\u00a0Here is the gist of it:I have a friend who was in the army and I called her for some advice. Did you look on their website? Or did you go and visit(a base)--that might be a good idea--then you could talk to people and get some answers.Secondly she told me that there are many people who get denied entry to the army because anyone who needs to take medication that they cannot live without cannot join the armed forces, for example anyone with a seizure disorder would be denied or a thyroid condition.Thirdly, she told me that Civil Servants do make a lot of money--somthing to think aboutThen their was a suggestion about CAP--CAP stands for Civil Air Patrol, and it appears from his comment that his friend seems to think that this organization may allow him to work for them. He was not clear about whether he wanted to be a pilot or whether he wants to do crew work, but this may be a way for him to do something with planes as a civilian. Perhaps he will re-surface and elaborate. Civil Air Patrol as a background will not, however, change the health restrictions of the Air Force. I am the wife of an Air Force professional, and know that health issues like this that require medication for survival will indeed prevent them from allowing him to join. It is partly because of the risk to that person if sent to a location or put in a situation where the medication is NOT available, and partly due to strictly financial issues -- active duty military are guaranteed health care for life, and no military organization can afford to bring in people that they know already have conditions that will require costly medications and treatment for the rest of their lives. There just is not room in the tight budget for that.",
