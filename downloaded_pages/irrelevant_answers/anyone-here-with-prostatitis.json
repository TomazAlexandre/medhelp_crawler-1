            "answer": "Not that I know of but on a regular blood and urine checup everything worked out on mine but a little bacteria. They are getting to me and think it is a basic UTI. I'm kind of lost. I'm married with a kid on the way and haven't had sex with strangers. I don't fit the Diabetes profile and have never been diagnosed. I'm not sure on prostate or kidney stones. My Dad said he had one at my age, 37, because he would hold it too long on road trips. The only thing I can think of is the last three weeks I have been one constant anxiety attack because fo health concerns. I thought I had a tumor then an MRI said brain was clean but some spots. I thought the spots were MS and I basically shut down eating for a week because my stomach was in knots. Found out I was clean there. Then I went to my cardiologist for basic blood panel and this. I have been taking everything from NuLev for stomach cramps to Nexium to my heart meds.",

            "answer": "Tom..Hey man, read your post about Bacterial Prostatitis...I was diagnosed with Prostatitis about 2 years ago...they found the same Staph Aureus in me as well and told me that everyone has that on their skin- have they done any testing on your actual semen??\u00a0\u00a0They could not give me an exact answer as far as why I had Prostatitis other than that \"it happens\"- well that just was not good enough, I knew there was something else that was causing my symptoms which include- sever pain at the tip- redness, irritation at the tip, itching, tingling feeling- just all around not feeling right in my groin/ penis area- I finally went to an STD specialist and it was discovered that I have Trichonomis- whic h is EXREMELY hard to detect in men, turns out that I had it for the past 2 years- this is a very curable std but again not easily diagnosed in men- the new Dr thinks that becuase it has gone undetected for almost 2 years it may have invaded my prostate and cuased permanent damage to my bladder, and prostate- I guess what I am trying to say it that there is a reason for your problem and do not just take the advice of your Dr as a final answer- if you feel there is something else causing your problem be persistant and demand other testing- I was actually tested for Trich about 1 year ago, after I suggested to be tested for it, and the results came back negative- the medical professionals make mistakes too so again be persistant to get answers-\u00a0\u00a0good luck man",
