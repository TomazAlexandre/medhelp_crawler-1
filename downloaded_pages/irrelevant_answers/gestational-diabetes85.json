    "question": "I'm 33 weeks and I had my first consultation today after being diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I haven't had the best time emotionally with this pregnancy (been feeling down due to stretch marks, fatigue, acne prone skin, lots of pains, etc..) but I'm determined to make the best of this situation not only for me but for my baby. I'm totally fine with having to take my blood sugar 6 times a day but I'm so thrown off by this diet. I usually eat a lot of carbs so now that I have to be cautious of how much carbs I take in I feel like I don't know what to eat or how to make this work. It doesn't help that I live with my boyfriend and his parents so I'm not the one that buys all the groceries or makes the dinner plans. Even if I explain to his parents my situation they don't really like/care about me so I doubt they'll be of much help. Has anyone else been in this situation? What are you ladies doing to make your diet easier?",
