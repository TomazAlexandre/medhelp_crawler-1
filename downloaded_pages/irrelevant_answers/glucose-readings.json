            "answer": "These are considered reference ranges. Not everyone is same as other conditions may come into play. Your doctor has your medical records and knows your medical history. He/she will set your ranges according to your health and age.Normal prandial [b4 meals]3.33 - 5.5 mmol/lPostprandial [2-3 hours after meals]below 7.77 mmol/l. Best is near 6.72 mmol/lBedtime same as prandial, although I have heard up to 8 mmol/l is acceptable which to me is asking for trouble.Ranges for A1c (HA1c, HgbA1c)Optimal\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a04.0-4.4% (3.6-4.4 mmol/l)Good\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4.5-4.9% (4.6-5.4 mmol/l)High\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05.0-5.4% (5.5-6.4 mmol/l)Prediabetes 5.5-5.9% (6.5-7.4 mmol/l)Don't go above 6%. Drug companies want you to believe it's OK to go a bit higher. Once you do diabetes drug dependency comes into play and you end up giving them some of your hard earned money.",
