    "question": "I have been feeling extremely lightheaded for the past two months non-stop. This feeling has been accompanied by about a dozen episodes of blacking out on the brink of fainting. When these black out incidents happen, they happen out of nowhere and come on instantly. I begin to sweat and have cold/hot flashes when this takes place. I recently have become extremely nauseous, especially about 20 minutes after I eat. I wake up in the middle of the night feeling extremely weak and even more nauseous and lightheaded than when I am awake. Throughout the day I will experience occasional hot flashes. I also have a consistent feeling of chest pressure that sometimes mkes me feel as though it is hard to catch my breath. I have been to the doctor about eight times now, gotten an MRI, and echocardiogram and a 24 hour heart monitor. Also, I have had blood work done testing my basic hormone pannel, Lupus, blood sugar, thyroid, oxygen levels, diabetes etc...Basically all the tests that are considered routine for these symptoms. All tests were normal. My doctor makes me feel as though he thinks I am making these symptoms up. I am unable to get out of my house and drive since I am afraid to black out or pass out behind the wheel or in public. I dunno if this helps but I had a daughter almost six months ago, so could it be hormones, electrolights or a metabolic disorder? What about a digestive problem? I am so desperate to get back to life and having fun with my family. I need answers or suggestions of what else to check for...Anyone who has any advice please help me! Thanks! I am also on BC.",
