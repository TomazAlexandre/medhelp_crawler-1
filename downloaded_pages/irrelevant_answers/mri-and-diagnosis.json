            "answer": "Hi, \u201cmini strokes or transient ischemic attacks could be due to embolus (a small blood clot) that occludes an artery in the brain. This most frequently arises from an atherosclerotic plaque in one of the carotid arteries (i.e. a number of major arteries in the head and neck) or from a thrombus (i.e. a blood clot) in the heart due to atrial fibrillationOther reasons include excessive narrowing of large vessels due to an atherosclerotic plaque and increased blood viscosity due to some blood diseases. TIA is related with other medical conditions like hypertension, heart disease (especially atrial fibrillation), migraine, cigarette smoking, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes mellitus.A TIA can be brought on by the use of certain psychiatric drugs such as Zyprexa\u201d.

    "question": "I went to the eye Dr. because I thought I was getting optic neuritis (which I had in 1993) again.\u00a0\u00a0With exertion, it\u2019s like a curtain of haze is being lifted from the bottom of my vision up words.\u00a0\u00a0I notice it more when I am exerting myself.\u00a0\u00a0They sent me so a specialist who sent me for an MRI which states:On the FLAIR and T2-weighted sequences, there are several foci of increased signal intensity present within the left frontal periventricular white matter. Foci of increased signal intensity are also present within the left parietal periventricular white matter, right superior frontal sub cortical white matter and right temporal sub cortical white matter. Additionally, there is a focus of increased signal intensity present within the left pons. These foci do not enhance following contrast. There is slight increased signal intensity seen within the left parietal per ventricular lesion on diffusion. This suggests that this lesion is acute/sub acute. These multiple lesions raise the possibility of demyelization disease (multiple sclerosis). Other post infectious/inflammatory etiologies could have this appearance in the appropriate clinical setting.After receiving the MRI results, while waiting for an appointment with a neurologist, I happen to run into 2 people who have MS.\u00a0\u00a0We spoke and they stated that other problems that I have such as tremors, numbness that travels up my leg, the vision problems, suddenly tripping for no reason, etc. were all symptoms that they have had relating to their MS. Well, I was seen by a neurologist today who stated it was most likely mini strokes and not MS. The thing that I don\u2019t understand, is that I have never had bad cholesterol or high blood pressure which I have read is the main causes of mini stroke. Yet he cannot explain the other symptoms which I don\u2019t understand.\u00a0\u00a0I would just like another opinion.Thank you,Lin",
