            "answer": "Hello 3babies,You've come to a good place for information about juvenile diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It is great that you've contaacted your child's pediatrician, since that is first call I would tell you to make.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms you describe are some of the classic symptoms of juvenile diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a physician, and so my perception is \"just\" that of a person who's had diabetes for a long time.It will likely be helpful for you to be able describe patterns (thirst, appetite, moods, and any triggers you might've noticed) to the doctor, much as you've done for us here.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor may give your child a simple in-house \"finger-stick\" blood test just to get a current reading.If, in fact, your child is diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes, that information can feel frightening to parents, siblings, and the child.\u00a0\u00a0Please know that there are good treatment options now available, also.\u00a0\u00a0I encourage you (plural) to include more than \"just\" the medical details in your approach to this disease.\u00a0\u00a0As with any chronic illness, and particularly those that strike children, there are social, emotional, and spiritual stresses and needs.\u00a0\u00a0Dealing with the whole person and not \"a patient\" can help nurture a competent & self-confident whole person.You will find that informing yourselves will be key to your family's success in managing and LIVING life even with diabetes as part of it.\u00a0\u00a0JDRF and others are also actively engaged in reseaerch that has resulted in our progress since \"the early days\" of treating diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I also live each day KNOWING that prevention & cures will be found in my lifetime.Will you let us know what you find out tomorrow?\u00a0\u00a0We all wish you the best.",
