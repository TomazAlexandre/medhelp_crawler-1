            "answer": "Yes viagra is likely to give these type of side effects.Withdrawal of viagra can clear the picture.I wonder you can persuade him to leave viagra for some time. Or his lady friend can talk to him. It will be difficult even for the doctor to judge whether it is from the old age or fatigue because of excess or old age.Yes you need advice from a more knowledgeable person.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply, answer.The problem with that lady friend is that she only cares for him to not look too old, so noway she will talk about it with him, probably she persuaded him to take the blue pill.Although she is a nurse, she does not know many things about diabetes, and last week he had a very bad low blood sugar episode, and she did not do anything to help him, so now I am more worried for him.I am trying to talk about it with him, but he pushes me away, and he does not let me talk about it right now.I hope that sooner or later it will get better...Thanks again!",

    "question": "My dad is 68 years old and has serious diabetes for a while now.8 months ago he met a woman, who is 10 years younger than him, and they started to date, and had sex together from the beginning.He is probably taking the \"magical blue pill\" to be able to perform, you know because of the diabetes and because he is older. I did not ask about it from him yet, but I noticed strange things and behaviour.The woman is a nurse, so he can get the pill very easily.He has a very serious short term memory loss for 6-7 months now, and he had a great memory, never had any problems before. I know he is older, ageing, and he went to the doctor, and its not dementia or Altzheimer or because he is older, but I suspect could it be because of Viagra?And in late January, he had a stroke. It was noticed only recently, and I read somewhere that in some special cases Viagra can cause stroke. Because he had an awful headache back then, he is not having headaches usually, but that was very serious, and it was after their visit, after they had sex - probably taking the pill.And I noticed he is often aggresive and has strange behaviour, he gets upset more easily.Recently he has some serious tremors, shakings, he tested for Parkinsons, but the test was negative, but he got a medicine for it, but that makes him very weak.My question is if the above things could be connected to taking Viagra, what can I do?Thank you!Kind regards,a worried daughter",
