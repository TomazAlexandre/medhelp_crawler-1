            "answer": "Your levels look like Hypothyroidism to me.Ask your Doctor to run antibody testing on your thyroid for Hashi's.If found that you have Hashimotos Autoimmune Disease, you will be on meds for life.Usually the Doc will start you off on a T4 med like Synthroid and then re-evaluate you 4-6 weeks later with new labs.If your labs show no antibodies then it may be thyroiditis and you will be on the T4 med until your levels stabilise.",
