Yesterday at my appt one of the nurses told me I had sugar in my urine.. no one mentioned it could be related to my back pain though. Sorry I'm not much of help with your situation, just had to share bc now I'm wondering if I too have a bladder infection.",

            "answer": "It's fine that's actually good that you mentioned it because I was told at yur on office they don't actually check for infections they check to see if you have enough protein and stuff like that my younger sister is the one who actually told me it was the hospital that noticed her infection ..I dont know if the infection has anything to do with the sugar in my urine it just has me curious because this is my third pregnancy and never have I had this happen",

            "answer": "So this can possibly be a one time scare ? Cause I'm 30 weeks and I've already took the sugar test and everything came back normal thats why I don't understand why it would show up in my urine months later",

    "question": "Okay ladies so I went to the er Sunday night due to very bad back pain which they thought was muscle spasms but turned out to be a bladder infection. They test my urine telling me I had sugar in my urine but my numbers came back normal after asking me have I ever been diabetic well I'm having family members telling me I should call my ob and let her know cause this doesn't sound normal. Has this ever happen to anyone ??",
