            "answer": "It sounds from your description that one of your eyes is moving horizontally out when you are attempting to focus. If this is an intermittent problem then myasthenia gravis, a disorder affecting muscles, would be highest on my list. If this is constant then other central nervous system cuases need to be excluded. Things which could result in a lesion in the brain which causes double vision include stroke, CNS inflammation, masses, elevated intracranial pressure, and aneurysms. Depending on your age this list would have to be modified. Having an MRI with contrast, and with orbital cuts would be a good starting point. This will help to exclude many of the disorders I mentioned. Lastly, if you are a diabetic, this could be related to your diabetes. Good luck",

            "answer": "As a person with myasthenia gravis ... I'd have to agree!When I over do the computer, I 'see' the cursor when it is not there. Many things seem to get 'stuck' in my vision, almost like refocusing doesn't remove the previous focus. I know several from the on line MG email lists also have the same problem ..this is a popular discussion as many neuros think we're screwy for continuing to 'see' things that are gone. I am totally convinced it's part of the weakened muscles not focusing properly.The weaker I am, the less my eyes work in conjunction with each other ...MG is nothing to mess with .. it can get pretty serious if not treated appropriately ...so get it checked out!",

            "answer": "You raise some interesting possibilities .I read that ciprofloxacin , which I have been taking , can mimic Myasthenia Gravis ,especially ocular myasthenia by disturbing acetylcholine function .You make me wonder if the interferon which I have been taking for 10 of so years for Myeloma could have upset the thymus region ,or at least produce some of the symptoms, repressing white cell production as it does .I have been experiencing intercostal pains in various places, which could be related .All very interesting,especially as my vision corrected itself after a fortnight or so . Wish I knew what I am talking about !Jandrew Kirby",

    "question": "A week ago I developed double vision resulting from a slight squint which developed overnight in me left eye .I have had the sinuses annd orbit X-rayed ,\u00a0\u00a0and will have an MRI scan tomorrow .It is almost as though I have been too close to the computer for too long, and my subdominant eye has drifted off, but has failed to click back into binocular vision .Can such a thing happen?Just by the way , when I was reading the newspaper an hour ago I saw the fleeting image of a computer cursor ( arrow ) which , of course was not there !Thanks",
