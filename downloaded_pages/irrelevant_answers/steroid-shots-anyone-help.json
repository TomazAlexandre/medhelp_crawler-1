            "answer": "You would of been given the steroid shots if your doc thought there was a chance of you delivering early. It is to help develop your baby's lungs so they have a better chance of survival if born early. As for the blood sugars, do you have gestational diabetes? This is normally diet controlled, so stay away from any starchy sugary foods, like carbs. You can't bring it down, only time and what you eat from now on will help that.",
