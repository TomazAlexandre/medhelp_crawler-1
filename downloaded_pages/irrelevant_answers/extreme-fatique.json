With my daughter I know it means she needs to adjust her insulin in take.I hope this information helps. Please come back and let us know how it is going",

            "answer": "Type 1 \"autoimmune\" diabetics whose immune systems have caused the diabetes sometimes have other endocrine glands affected by the same immune system. Thyroid problems are fairly common, when the immune system attacks the thyroid gland just like it did the pancreas. Most doctors check our thyroid activity every few checkups to make sure that all is well.Anyway, in addition to the fairly common thyroid malfunction, the adrenal glands can be attacked. This happened to my identical twin sister, who is also a type 1 diabetic, but not to me, oddly enough. If the adrenal glands are damaged so that they don't produce enough cortisol, fatigue is extreme and it just gets worse until the problem is diagnosed and treated with prednisone or cortisol.My suggestion would be to not assume that this is normal for a diabetic, for it is NOT normal to feel exhausted. In my case, the only thing that causes extreme feelings of exhaustion are low or high glucose levels, but these feelings go away as soon as the sugar levels are normalized. If the feelings of fatigue are not related to abnormal glucose levels, you may want to ask your doctor to check your thyroid and adrenal levels. If either is not functioning properly, fatigue will be one symptom, and both conditions are fairly easily treated. Good luck to you!",

            "answer": "I have been a T1 diabetic for 42 years. At about 38 years, I also felt exausted every day, and especially after exercise. Through mostly luck, I discovered atherosclerosis to be the cause, with 90% blockage in arteries to my heart. This is a commonly underdiagnosed problem for diabetics, as high glucose levels accelerate the condition and autonomic neuropathy\u00a0\u00a0masks the discomfort we would normally feel (angina pain). If you have not recently been evaluated for this condition, you should seriously consider it, even if it is not the root cause of your tiredness.Larry",
