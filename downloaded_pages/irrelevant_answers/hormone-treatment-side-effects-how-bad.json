            "answer": "Hi there!Though the Gleason score does not look good, it is good that the cancer has not metastasized i.e. to say the stage relates more to the prognosis than the score. Hopefully this should turn out to be fine after treatment. You could read more about the possible side effects and things to watch out for during therapy online at any standard health website.Hope this information is helpful.Take care!",

            "answer": "I apologize for not replying to your comment re: my husband's diagnosis & treatment plans.Now that a year has gone by, I'm happy to say he is doing pretty well, considering everything. He had 40+ radiation treatments, along with hormone treatments, one of which he\u00a0\u00a0is continuing for the foreseeable future (Lupron injections every 3 months). He has slowly gained strength following the radiation, though the worst side effects of it are mostly gone (diarrhea & painful, frequent urination). Unfortunately, he is now impotent (we were told to expect this), but he mostly has control of his bladder & bowel, except during a recent episode of radiation proctitis. His oncologist isthrilledthat his last 2 PSA test results came back without a detectable reading!Not too bad for an old man (73) who has multiple health problems (COPD, diabetes, gout, high BP, etc.). I think it doesn't hurt that he's got a great sense of humor, and is usually putting others at ease.",

    "question": "My husband was diagnosed with prostate cancer (Gleason 10). It looks like they will do the external radiation and hormone therapy. What can you tell me about side effects?BTW, after a number of imaging tests, it does not appear to have metastasized (though it looks like it's probably spread locally to the bladder.",
