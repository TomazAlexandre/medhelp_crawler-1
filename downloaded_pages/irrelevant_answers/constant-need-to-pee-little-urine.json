            "answer": "Hello,The urge of frequent urination can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diuretic drugs and pregnancy.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography , pregnancy blood test, thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made. I\u2019ll suggest consulting a urologist for the same and getting the uroflowmetry test done which actually tests the emptying of the urinary bladder.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hi I'm 29 in good general health I started having these problems a few days ago and don't understand what is going on. I started having a huge need to pee every few minutes with little coming out but a trickle even after I have drunk a lot. The urge and pressure is always there and it drives me nuts. The doctor gave me antibiodic injection for possible std but I don't think that was the issue because I'm still having the problem of bladder fullness with little coming out and a weak stream. They did a urinealysis which came back negative for any infection. Still waiting on the culture results..I wonder what could be causing this, there is no pain or burning or fever just a constant need to pee with small trickle of urine. Could it be a enlarged prostate? I think I have a internal hemmeroid but not sure if that would matter and I've had it awhile and I never had these bladder issues until recently. Just not sure what to think. Will the urine culture rule out any infection in the urine or prostate? Really would like some input/advice from anyone who can offer, thanks!",
