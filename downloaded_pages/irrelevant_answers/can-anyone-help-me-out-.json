            "answer": "Hello,Your A1C is elevated but I would not call that level of 6.3%\u00a0\u00a0\"very\" elevated. It means your average blood sugars are higher than they should be and you likely have diabetes or prediabetes. This may be contributing to some of your symptoms so you should contact your primary doctor to have this treated as soon as possible.Take care and I hope you are able to find the source of your symptoms soon.",
