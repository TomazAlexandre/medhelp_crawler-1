            "answer": "Was diagnosed at 13 also, I'm 19 now and 26 weeks. I was on metformin lantus and humalog then they took me off metformin and changed to levimer and humalog. My Dr made me a high risk patient so I get more visits. Its harder because I need to test more but its worth it.My Dr is also very curious on my body and my baby though because once I begay second trimester insulin made my sugars spike (600+) and ice cream, cake, candy etc would make me low (75-90) so I haven't been able to take my insulin. He says its very rare but a possibility I could be considered borderline diabetic once the baby comes.There are a lot of risks but its worth it long as you do what your supposed to",
