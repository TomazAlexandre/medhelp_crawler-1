            "answer": "Hi Erir,I'm a volunteer here and not a medical professional so I can't be sure of exactly which procedure you have had. However, I looked on the website of the National Kidney and Urologic Diseases and it is possible that you have had a penile implant. That is when a surgeon \"implants a device that inflates or unbends to create an erection\". You can check out their website for more information: http://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/ED_EZ%5Cindex.htmI hope this helps.Good luck to you!",
