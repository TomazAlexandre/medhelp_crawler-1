    "question": "I have been diagnosed recently that my TSH is 12 which is very low thyroid...I tend to get dizzy,light head,and anxiety,dry mouth and eye irritations often. I also feel that Diabetes also have simillar symptoms. I was not told that I have blood sugar problems by the Doctors. But seems like all the symptoms of diabetes. I am scared and my day to day life is at mess due to all these physical conditions that I face. Can some one advise me whether Thyroid and Diabetes problems are alike? Is there any cure ? I am planning to get my blood work once again and currently looking for a good doctor at NJ.",
