            "answer": "I would. None of these things can hurt you or your baby. I would however stay away from a few things...like castor oil as that may cause contractions but will not result in anything unless your body & baby r ready. It causes contractions by fetal distress so id say thats not good for u.But, excersize ball, squats, sex, walking are all great for you (close to delivery or not). Im not a tea person nor have i heard too much about it so i dont have an input on that. But either way, good luck and hopefully your baby comes in a couple weeks, i know u dont want that but baby gaining weight is important ;)",

            "answer": "Ohh I will only try safe things I don't want to hurt my baby!! I'm worried she's not putting on weight and growing anymore that's why I want her out so that she can thrive better outside the womb. If my midwife would give more information and explain things I might not feel this way but like yesterday I asked what I needed to do to try and help my baby put on weight her response was \"we are inducing the 6th\" wth ya know. Everything I have read says that baby's with growth restrictions should be born by 38 weeks",

            "answer": "Didnt they give you Ultrasound to measure? I had a lady she had growth restrictions. but she was getting U/S every week to see progress and she was 35weeks pg.. they were not going to induce her or anything.. they were just keeping an eye on her.. she had it with her both sons one was born at 39wks 6.8lb and second was born at 40wks 7.5lb.. so basically they were wrong.. she went all the way to 40wks because even though she kept measuring same but babies were gaining weight :)... its all your choice you can ask for induction but midwives know baby can gain weight at any point :)",

    "question": "I'm 37+2 and have had gestational diabetes since 28 weeks my baby also has a growth restriction at least that's what they think because my fundal height hasn't changed since 34 weeks. I honestly feel like my baby is safer out than in my midwife plans to induce at 39 weeks but I don't trust her judgment I know I'm not a doctor or midwife but when the person you are trusting to get your baby here safe FORGETS your a diabetic at 34 and 36 weeks 4 weeks after the diagnosis and has seen that your fundal height hasnt changed since 34 weeks leaving baby measuring at 32 weeks and still hasn't done anything its hard to trust that person when you feel like she don't even know your name after 8-9 months of seeing you. Her nurse actually asked me yesterday if I've had my diabetes test!! This woman had no idea that I contract at every non stress test 1-8 mins apart every singe time I go!!! I feel like my baby would do better outside of me then in!! I know baby wont come til she's ready but is it wrong of me to try and induce naturally? With the ball sex walking and that tea I keep hearing about? Would you try to induce naturally?",
