    "question": "I went for a routine checkup yesterday and I just found out that I have Gestational Diabetes. I am beyond angry with this doctors office because I will be 36 weeks tomorrow. My fundal height is measuring at 40 weeks and my growth scan registered the baby at nearly 10 lbs 6 oz. They were trying to get me to go up to about 39 weeks since there is no medical issue with me. I had a NST done as well as another scan which registered him being at 9 lbs 2 oz last night. After 8 hours of being at the Doctors, I now have a scheduled c-section at 38 weeks which is the 21st. Can anyone give me any advice on c-sections or babies born to mothers that have GD? I am so worried.",
