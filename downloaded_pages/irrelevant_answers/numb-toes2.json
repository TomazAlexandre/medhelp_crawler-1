            "answer": "Hi,Hope you are feeling better.Numbness in the big toe can occur due to diabetes or B12 deficiency. Since you have undergone blood tests to rule out both these conditions, other possibilities need to be considered like nerve compression in the foot or peripheral arterial diseases (PAD) like Reynaud\u2019s disease.Do you have a history of smoking?If yes there are chances of PAD. Please discuss these possibilities with your treating doctor. Take care!",
