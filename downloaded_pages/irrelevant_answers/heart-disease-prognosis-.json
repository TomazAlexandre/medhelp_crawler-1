            "answer": "Dear Dawn,Diabetes can be a very devastating disease on the heart but that does not mean there are not treatment options.\u00a0\u00a0First she must change the things that she can change: If she smokes she must must must stop (today); begin an exercise program as recommended by her doctor; change her diet to low fat, low cholesterol, low carbohydrate diet; maintain tight control of her diabetes (no higher than 110); and try taking steps to reduce stress in her life.\u00a0\u00a0Next she needs to work closely with her doctor on her medications.\u00a0\u00a0There are a number of good medications that will help with her symptoms and with prolonging her life.\u00a0\u00a0TMR may be an option down the road if she continues to have symptoms.No doctor has a crystal ball to predict how long someone will live but if she makes changes now she could very well live to see her grandchildren grow up.",

    "question": "My mother had a bypass surgery in Feb of this year. She is 53 years old, NEVER had a heart attack, NOT overweight, and her cholesterol is good. However she is diabetic and both that and heart disease runs in my family.\u00a0\u00a0Just 2 weeks ago she started experience chest pains again, just like before the bypass. She went back in for a angigram, and following that the doctors discharged her and said their was nothing they could do because she had heart disease and all the small artieries and blood vessils were still progressing badly (like that of a 90 year old).\u00a0\u00a0Her primary care physican has suggested regulating her blood sugar as much as possible, watching her diet, and switching to a synthetic insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I really think my mom is too young to have the doctors say their is nothing they can do.\u00a0\u00a0And almost all the information I can find on the internet about synthetic insulin (as opposted to human), is all negative and very scary (in regards to studies that have caused comas).\u00a0\u00a0I have scheduled an appointment for a second opinion, and I\u00a0\u00a0know TMR could be an option in the future. My question to you is how long can someone life with Heart Disease, and some studies I read about have said you can reverse it or stop the progression of it with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0My mother is just hysterical about not seeing her grandchilden (my brother and I are in our 20's and not married yet).\u00a0\u00a0None of the doctors have given us a timeline, so I have no idea how long someone can live with heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone can offer any suggestions or opinions, I would appreciate it.",
