            "answer": "Hi,Are you currently on any medication that could have caused a change in the urine?Have you had any significant weight loss since you started noticing these symptoms?The most common cause of oily urine is ketones in urine. These appear in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes and also during periods of starvation or a stringent dietary regimen.Presence of oily substance in urine along with orangish or dark yellow-colored urine can be attributed to biliary disease or jaundice.You will need to increase your intake of water and\u00a0\u00a0intake a minimum of 2000 ml per day.Avoid caffeine and alcohol.Do keep us poste don your doubts and progress.Regards",

            "answer": "Hi,The ideal way to lose weight is not to starve oneself. Starving yourself will only make the body pack in more stores for another bout of starvation, so you are not helping yourself by this process.You will need to keep your calorie intake over 1000 per day if you want to lose weight.It is possible that the gall bladder problem may have contributed partly to your weight gain.The best option for you to lose weight would be to consume small meals very 2 hours or so. This need not be anything substantial - just a glass of milk or salad.Your body's BMR would increase to burn up the calories supplied so frequently.Jaundice would not appear on some days and not on others. It would persist and would only fade with improved liver function an or removal of the obstruction causing the jaundice.Additionally, you would also have noticed altered stool color.It is possible that the oily substance you have reported is just ketones produced in response to poor diet.You will need to change your diet to fit in with your long-term goals of weight.Do post here for any further guidance in this regard.",

I was born jaundiced and then I got it again in my teens and haven't been able to get rid of it but I never had oily urine before. My diet is normal, I don't take meds, don't drink alcohol ever, no coffee, hardly drink caffeinated drinks just occasional chocolate or iced tea. My weight has been fairly constant 120-127lbs. I've been to Drs and blood test always indicate high bilirubin but Drs never seem concerned or offer any real solutions for high bilirubin or my jaundice. Also Dr has said I have subclinical hipothyroid but that its not significant enough to start any treatment. I don't know if I should find another Dr or trust his opinion.",

            "answer": "Without your gallbladder, you will not assimilate oils and fats from digestion as quickly and completely as before. It may be possible that when you eat much more oil than your body can assimilate properly, you will get a tiny bit of oil in your urine. The amino acid taurine can stimulate bile flow to aid in fat absorption (and better digestion generally). Saponins may help too (in cilantro and many other foods with \"soapy\" texture).",
