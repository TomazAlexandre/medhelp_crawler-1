            "answer": "The glucose test? I believe its around 24 weeks but I could be wrong. But they have a wide window of time for you to take it:) I recommend not eating before. I ate before and because of the sugar I had eaten through the day plus the crazy sugary drink it caused me to have to take the 3 hour test just to find out I don't have pregnancy diabetes. So I wouldn't eat before or make sure you don't eat sugar:)",

            "answer": "I had mine at 28 weeks. And i agree with her ^^^ I ate before and also had to do the 3 hour test and it was horrible! But I passed the 3 hour test because I didn't eat before and only took sips of water. I would recommend scheduling an early appt so you don't have to starve throughout the day! :)",

            "answer": "Yea it's between 24 and 28 weeks. You're not suppose to eat anything 8-10 hours before The test, and only small sips of water. It's really not that bad, the drink tasted like flat sprite, I had the lemon like flavor. Honestly having my blood taken three times during the test was worse then the drink. Don't be worried, it's fine",
