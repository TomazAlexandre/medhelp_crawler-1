            "answer": "I was the same way when I was 15 just before I got diagnosed. So your best out would be to get you checked as soon as you get up in the morning. I was always thirsty and drinking something and constantly getting up in the middle of the night drinking water or something sweet and going to the bathroom but if she's not urinating that often with all this water you need to get her kidneys checked also. There is every need to be concerned when it comes to your child because I make sure to keep an eye on mine since it runs in my family and I have it. Go get her checked",
