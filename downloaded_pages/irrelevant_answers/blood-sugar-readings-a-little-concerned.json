    "question": "A few years ago I was diagnosed as pre diabetic, but I lost 60 pounds and I was able to get my blood sugar down to reasonable levels.I just had a blood test to apply for Life Insurance. I'm a 38 year old male and I'm about 220 pounds. I got a blood glucose reading of 77 mg/dl (I hadn't eaten for 4 hours) but my fructosamine rating was 1.8 (out of a range of 0-2.0).Should I be worried?",
