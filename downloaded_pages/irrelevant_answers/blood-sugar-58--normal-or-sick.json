            "answer": "First things first, the use of the word \"sick\" is not applicable and is dreadful sounding. When referring to diabetes one falls into one of three classifications; normal, prediabetes, or diabetes.As long as the test times were done fasting, or postprandial [2-3 hours after a meal] then your test results are useful. If so, 5.8 mmol/l is considered prediabetes but only by tiny wee bit. Considering 5.5 mmol/l is regarded as the top range for fasting glucose this is probably why your doctor said normal. For non-diabetics many doctors use 4.44 - 6.66 mmol/l as normal postprandial [after meal] ranges.It's quite simple to lower to your glucose with weight loss, daily exercise, and by reducing carbohydrate food intake. Good luck",

I did check it out later and it appeared to be 5.8, for doc it was normal.Now i was able to test myself twice using strips, one after meal and one after waking up, both times it was exactly\u00a0\u00a05.8.After looking from internet things are little absurd cause WHO says i' am ok, but ADA says i am sick.Those things really do mess with my head, WHO i believe? Or my doctor, or ADA?",
