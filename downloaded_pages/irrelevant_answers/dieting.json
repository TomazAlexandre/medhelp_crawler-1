That is one lesson I am having to learn patience!It sounds like you are off to a good start... In no time at all someone will look at you and say wow you lost weight! I never notice my weight before other's do!Also, try taking measurements as well as weighing in. Maybe that will help you see the difference faster..",

            "answer": "So it's Friday now, and it's also the last day of my period.\u00a0\u00a0I weighed myself again this morning, right before I did the treadmill.....265lbs, up 2lbs from yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0So now I'm starving, working out, and gaining weight. Either I need a new scale or I need to have my jaw wired shut. Either way, on August 17, I go back to the doctor, at which time she'll probably put me on a liquid diet and/or some sort of medication, which I'd hoped to avoid,",

    "question": "I'm 5\"1 and female, and my unhealthy lifestyle has led to my present weight of 273lbs. As of Monday, July 19, 2010, I implemented a change.\u00a0\u00a0I traded my usual fast food lunch (two slices of pizza, or burgers, or fried food) for something less fattening (an apple, a head of anise, carrots), I stopped having my usual after work snack of 9-12 pieces of sliced cheese (at 90 calories per piece), I try not to go overboard at dinner.\u00a0\u00a0I also gave up my two favorite after dinner snacks, ice cream and hard liquor (previously, I'd been drinking between 4 and 6 ounces of hard liquor a night, and I know, weight management maybe isn't my only concern if I've been drinking that heavily).So I started this diet on Monday, after being told by a doctor that I'm in the \"high risk group\" for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor also said that weight loss would require \"a lot of starvation\".So today is only Thursday. I've weighed myself, this morning, and, according to the scale, I now weigh 263......a full 10lbs lighter.\u00a0\u00a0I think this must be some sort of a mistake, though, because I don't FEEL lighter, none of my size 24 pants fit any looser.So I just wanted to know if, and when, I will start to have some visible, tangible, result of my new, restricted diet.",
