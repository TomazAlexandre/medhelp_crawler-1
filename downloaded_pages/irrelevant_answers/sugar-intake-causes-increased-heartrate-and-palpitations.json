    "question": "I was diagnosed Type 2 Diabetes in Nov of 2003.My family is full of diabetics (they all Type 1's though, I am the only Type 2 so far), so it really came as no suprise.I'm generally extremely careful about what I eat, but I've noticed the odd time I allow myself something sweet, my heart rate really kicks up (as high as 100-120 bpm) and I get palpitations.Also,\u00a0\u00a0the odd palpitation is a little painful (kind of like a \"pinch\" inside my chest). Is it normal for palps to be a little painful?Are increased heartrate and palpitations upon sugar ingestion normal for a diabetic? Not related to diabetes at all? If not - what else could it be?What can I do about it, (aside from the obvious, which would be to not allow myself even the most rare splurge of sweets)?Thank you sincerely,Nancy (49 yrs old)PS: I also have hypertension, hypothyroid and fibromyalgia. My thyroid levels are presently optimized.",
