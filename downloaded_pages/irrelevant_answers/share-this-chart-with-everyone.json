Certainly none of them is going to hurt you.Personally, although I eat them all because they taste good and make me feel good, I am skeptical of the power of any particular food or diet to prevent or cure disease. I'm just saying that even though I would like to believe it is so, I don't count on it.Also, it would be helpful, and not an unreasonable thing to ask for, if you could present any evidence to support these claims. Could you post some links to the \"files from doctors\" that you mentioned?",

don'ts after a meal*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't smoke-Experiment from experts proves that smoking a cigarette after meal is comparable to smoking 10 cigarettes (chances of cancer is higher).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 &nbs p; &nb sp;*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't eat fruits immediately - Immediately eating fruits after meals will cause stomach to be bloated with air. Therefore take fruit 1-2 hr after meal or 1 hr before meal.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Don't drink tea - Because tea leaves contain a high content of acid. This substance will cause the Protein content in the food we consume to be hardened thus difficult to digest.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't loosen your belt - Loosening the belt after a meal will easily cause the intestine to be twisted &blocked.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't bathe - Bathing will cause the increase of blood flow to the hands, legs & body thus the amount of blood around the stomach will therefore decrease.\u00a0\u00a0This will weaken the digestive system in our stomach.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't walk about - People always say that after a meal walk a hundred steps and you will live till 99. In actual fact this is not true. Walking will cause the digestive system to be unable to absorb the nutrition from the food we intake.*\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Don't sleep immediately - The food we intake will not be able to digest properly. Thus will lead to gastric & infection in our intestine.FINALLY DONT JUST KEEP THIS EMAIL....PLEASE FORWARD IT TO YOUR\u00a0\u00a0 FRIENDS.LET THEM BE AWARE!!",
