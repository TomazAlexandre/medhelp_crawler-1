    "question": "I am 33 weeks pregnant and its like morning sickness is back. Everytime I wake up I have to throw up. I have been getting really bad headaches and my vision has blurred a few times. Now I've done my research and I know thar these are all signs of pre eclampsia but 3 weeks ago my doctor did a 24 hour urine because there was protein there but it came back okay. Then I had no other symptoms now I have all these. I'm not sure what to do. I go to the doctor on Monday so ill ask then but just wondering if anyone has had this happen or any advice. Oh yeah I also have gestational diabetes.",
