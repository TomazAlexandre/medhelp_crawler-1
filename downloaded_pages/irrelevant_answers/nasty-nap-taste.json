            "answer": "Hi there,I get that too - just started recently.\u00a0\u00a0I tend to sleep with my mouth open and I think that's what's causing that to happen for me.\u00a0\u00a0Do you do that as well do you know?\u00a0\u00a0Also, do you have any breathing hesitation or feeling that it's harder to breath when lying flat on your back?\u00a0\u00a0I have that too.Have you had your blood sugar tested recently?\u00a0\u00a0Because I believe sometimes a pre-diabetic or diabetic state can cause that.\u00a0\u00a0Either one of those can be brought way down by a healthy diet/exercise.\u00a0\u00a0That's what my husb (he's pre-diabetic - I don't think I am yet) and I are struggling with now.\u00a0\u00a0We just keep plugging along though\u00a0\u00a0:)",

            "answer": "Usually, bacteria are the culprit. I have the same problem and I use a tongue scraper (usually you can buy one that is on the back side of your tooth brush). Halitosis (bad breath) sour taste in the mouth are bacteria especially at the back of the tongue. You can also use 3% hydrogen peroxide and dip your toothbrush in it and brush the tongue a couple times a day for a few days and see if it helps. The comment about diabetes can't hurt to get checked for that as well.",

            "answer": "Yes, I forgot to say overnight you always get bacteria in your mouth (hence, dentists telling you to brush teeth at night but also in the AM as well).\u00a0\u00a0That is one of the culprits that causes the bad taste (smells, etc.).If one's mouth is at all open during the night it dries up the saliva which would ordinarily help decrease the bacteria.",

            "answer": "Thank you both for your advice. I don't have diabetes. I know this for sure. I've had enough bloodwork done lately to confirm it. I'll try the tongue thing. But I've tried this in the past and it hasn't helped. But I'm open to trying things again.Thanks!",

            "answer": "I had the bad taste thing happen to me a few years back.\u00a0\u00a0It stayed that way for like a month or two it seemed.\u00a0\u00a0It went as far as making water taste 'metal-ey'.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have that as well?If it's not from a blood sugar issue I would think it's either something you ate (if it goes away very soon) with an odd spice that you don't usually have, possibly from a medication that you might be on (even if it hasn't caused this before it could now), possibly in the middle of the night post-nasal drip from sinuses (or a new sinus infection - and sometimes they have no symptoms), and also again, from sleeping with your mouth open - that's a biggy.:)",

    "question": "Every time I take a nap I wake up with such a strange, horrid taste in my mouth. Some times it's more of a sweet taste, some times it's more of a sour taste. It doesn't matter what I do or what I eat throughout the rest of the day, the taste doesn't ever go away.Any suggestions??Thanks in advance!",
