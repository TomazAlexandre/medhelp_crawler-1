            "answer": "Sometimes pancreatitis can be suspected by a blood test if the amylase and lipase levels are elevated, though it is not unusual for a person with advanced pancreatitis to NOT\u00a0\u00a0show elevated levels, so the blood test is not a totally accurate diagnostic tool for this condition.\u00a0\u00a0Other tests done to determine pancreatitis are stool tests, triglyceride tessts, ultrasounds, x-rays, MRI's, CT-scans, ERCP's, endoscopic ultrasounds, and more rarely, the secretin stimulation test or the bentiromide test.Some symtoms of pancreatitis are: mid-abdominal pain that radiates to the back, weight loss, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, difficulty and pain digesting fats and proteins and fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Not all people have all of these symptoms, some only a few.\u00a0\u00a0At the onset of my acute, and then later chronic pancreatitis, I had all of these symptoms at one time or another.Please feel free to email me if you have any further questions.Nanny***@****",

            "answer": "My sister was diagnosed with diabetes when she was 9, she is now 20, and she has been to hell and back the past few years with pancreatitis, adhesions, and numerous other difficulties.\u00a0\u00a0She was recently blessed with a new pancreas and although the pancreas is working beautifully, she is still having difficulty with nausea and pain.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure that many people face these difficulties when they have as much surgery as she has had (from her adhesions, pancreatitis, and gastroparesis (spelling?).Anyway, 5 1/2 weeks later after transplant surgery, she has lost so much weigt etc... etc... etc... she is just so sick!\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas from anyone?\u00a0\u00a0Is Crohn's disease a possibility? or anything someone isn't paying attention too?\u00a0\u00a0I'm obviously not very medically backgrounded - but I will send ANY feedback to her - she deserves a life of happiness!\u00a0\u00a0Especially at her young age - I remember what my life was like at 20 and I feel very guilty to have had such a fun experience!HELP!glo",
