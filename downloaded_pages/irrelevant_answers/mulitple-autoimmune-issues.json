            "answer": "I have, both Hashimoto's and Pernicious Anemia (unable to absorb B12).\u00a0\u00a0They are dealt with separately. Hashimoto's is not treated \"per se\"; it's the resulting hypothyroidism that's treated with replacement hormones.\u00a0\u00a0Pernicious Anemia is treated with vitamin B12 shots; usually, monthly, but in my case, weekly.Once a person has one autoimmune the chances are greater that they will have another.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, autoimmunes tend to run in families, but family members don't always have the same ones...... for instance, I have Hashi and PA, my son has Type I diabetes and my daughter has lupus. Both of them are likely to end up with one or more, other autoimmunes. I suspect that my daughter has Hashi, but she won't bring me labs, so I can't prove it. I suspect that she isn't getting the proper tests.",

            "answer": "I have autoimmune pernicious anaemia (rare juvenile form), Hashimoto's thyroiditis, and vitiligo. I handle things far better when i have a diagnosis. ;)About 25% of patients with autoimmune diseases have a tendency to develop additional autoimmune diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Three or more autoimmune diseases is known as multiple autoimmune syndrome (MAS).\u00a0\u00a0The MAS classifications are helpful if signs of another autoimmune disease emerges.Type 1 MAS: myasthenia gravis, thymoma, polymyositis, giant cell myocarditis.Type 2 MAS: Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, scleroderma, autoimmune thyroid disease.Type 3 MAS: autoimmune thyroid disease, myasthenia gravis and/or thymoma, Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, pernicious anaemia, idiopathic thrombopenic purpura, Addison's disease, type 1 diabetes mellitus, vitiligo, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatitis herpetiformis.The immune system marker HLA-B8 and/or DR3 or DR5 seems to be an important factor in Type 3 MAS.Other conditions found in various combinations in MAS:Type 1 MAS: pemphigus, autoimmune thyroid disease.Type 2 MAS: chronic active hepatitis, systemic lupus erythematosus, pemphigus, bullous pemphigoid, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, idiopathic thrombopenic purpura, alopecia areata, Addison's disease.Type 3 MAS: acquired primary hypogonadism, hypophysitis, rheumatoid arthritis, primary biliary cirrhosis, relapsing polychondritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic active hepatitis, ulcerative colitis, scleroderma.",

    "question": "Hi All,I was just diagnosed with Graves (this morning, though I've known for awhile it was either Graves or Hashi's) and I also have Vitiligo.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor mentioned that now that I have two autoimmne disease I need to keep an eye out for more because they clustered. I was wondering if anyone here has more than one, and how they handle it?Thank you!",
