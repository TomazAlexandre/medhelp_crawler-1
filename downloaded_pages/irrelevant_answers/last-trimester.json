            "answer": "Hi hun,It is a though situation and probably not what you had planned to be in..Do you have any family you can turn to for comfort?It is important that you do not fall into a deppression or helplessness feelings.Ideally the father to be should not have a new gf, maybe you two can try to work things out now that you'll have his child?If not, prepare for a single mother life.And the single life can look pretty hard, I believe it is, but it is far from impossible.Divide up your problems and deal with them one at the time -instead of looking at them as one massive cloud of problems.I'm sure your friends, family and possibly the community can help you to stand on both feet.Good luck! and do your best for your 3yo daughter and the new baby. They need you, more than ever.",

            "answer": "I know that sometimes there are a lot of reasons that people give not to go, but have you considered counseling? It can really help a lot to feel heard and to find new ways of looking at situations. There are free options, weekend options, etc. for whatever situation. This may help you more than short responses.",
