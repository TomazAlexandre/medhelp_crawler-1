            "answer": "Dear John:Sorry that your having the symptoms you describe.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if I will be able to help, your symptoms are very diverse and cover many different body systems.\u00a0\u00a0I guess the first couple of questions would be if you were in perfect health prior to the onset of memory loss.\u00a0\u00a0Is the memory loss progressive or has it remained the same for the last three years.\u00a0\u00a0What sort of labs have you had performed and what were the results-any abnomalities?\u00a0\u00a0What did the MRI of the brain show, and what did the EEG show?\u00a0\u00a0Are you on any medications?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any systemic illnesses, such as rheumatoid arthritis, amyloidosis, diabetes, alcohol abuse, sarcoid, etc?\u00a0\u00a0Your headaches do not have the flavor of a migraine.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, migraines last anywhere from 4 to 72 hours, so yours are rather short.\u00a0\u00a0If your short but intense headaches occur at a particular time of year or times of the year and are repeatitive, than you might suffer from cluster headaches.\u00a0\u00a0These might give you symptoms what you describe, but also they would give symptoms of unilateral watery eyes, running nose, maybe sweating.My suggestion would be to see a good neurologist and have a complete review of what tests have been performed, their results, and a good exam.\u00a0\u00a0Then given this material, one can pursue a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find the answer to your problem.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

            "answer": "Dear Friend,(I hope this goes to the correct area)I had suffered from Migraines for years after a motor bike accident\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0\u00a01981. I put these down to the head injury I suffered and put up with them. I swallowed Codiene tablets (Panadiene Forte) like lollies.Then I had my eyes tested and found I needed glasses, I also found out that one eye was not performing as well as the other. Since I have had my glasses the Migraines are gone, life is so different now. Have your eyes tested as a way of eliminating that as a cause of your migraines. I hope this helps you a little. Johnno",

    "question": "I am a 48 year old male. Lets call me John.I just stumbled onto this site in desperation. I have been off work for 3 years, seeing different doctors and recieving many diagnosis. Symotoms started with intervals of short term memory loss. Minor things like peoples names, what car I was driving or which way a letter or number would face etc. Also started having dissy spells accompanied by nausea when working on the computer for more than 1/2 an hour. This would also occure when driving in a city at night. It seems to be brought on by the moving lights or things moving on the compuiter screen. I also get swelling in my right hand and arm. At times I have unexplained pain in my arms, legs and other parts of my body. Also get severe, but short (15 to 30 sec.) head-achs. Usually followed by impared vision in 1 eye. I also have problems with mood swings and anxiety attachs.\u00a0\u00a0I would appreciate any comments or suggestions you might have.\u00a0\u00a0Thank-you.....\u00a0\u00a0John",
