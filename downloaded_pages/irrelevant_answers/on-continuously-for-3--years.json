    "question": "Almost 4 years ago - woke up with blurred/dim vision suddenly in right eye only - come to find out it is optic neuritis. 4 years later - after numerous tests ( including but not limited to: bloodwork to rule out autoimmunes, std's, cancer, diabetes, cat scratch, lyme disease, other, 2 spinal taps to check CSF pressure, MS, other infection, 3 MRI's to rule out tumor and MS, other tests) All coming back negative for any disease - still have ON - not bouts of ON with remission - but continual ON for 4 years - with no change, but constant active inflammation of Optic Nerve. Can't seem to find any info on ON that has lasted that long and my Dr. (neuro-opthamologist) is baffled - please, pleae - if anyone has experienced this or hasd any info - I would appreciate it! Thank you :)",
