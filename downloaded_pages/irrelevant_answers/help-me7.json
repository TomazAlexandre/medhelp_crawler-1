            "answer": "With all the working out that you were doing it appears that you were not having enough energy foods to keep you going.\u00a0\u00a0The types of food that you require are those that are slow release energy foods, like porridge, protein foods, complex carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0Not sugary foods that cause a high sugar surge and a drop very quickly.Would be a good idea to get checked out for diabetes.You may have been suffering from hypoglycaemia.\u00a0\u00a0This is when the sugar levels drop in your body giving you the symptoms that you described.Another reason is also due to dehydration.\u00a0\u00a0When you are working out, your body is losing fluids through sweating, it is important therefore to drink fluids, like the energy drinks that give you back the salts that are lost through perspiration as well as the water.With the cramping, this could be due to lack of magnesium and salts and definitely lack of fluid in your body.\u00a0\u00a0So do drink your water and do not become dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0Dehydration can lead to headaches and the formation of kidney stones and other problems.To find out your body mass, you can check your weight to height ration on the web.\u00a0\u00a0This will then give you information whether your weight to your height is fine, under or overweight, obese or morbidly obese.If you are overweight, the thing is to eat healthily and losing 1-2 pounds a week is considered a safe and steady way to lose.Best wishes.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "If you had the HbA1c blood test, this test indicates your blood glucose levels for the previous two to three months.Did the doctor tell you the test result in mmol/mol ?The following web page gives information about the HbA1c levels and what they mean.\u00a0\u00a0You can also convert mmol/mol to percentage figures and visa versa.You can experience low blood sugar levels without having diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So when you are well enough again to work out, don't do more than 5 days in a week, eat slow release foods like explained in my previous post to you, and always have a bottle of water with you to replace the fluids that you lose through perspiration.Best wishes.",
