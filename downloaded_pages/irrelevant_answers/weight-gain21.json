            "answer": "Hi there!! I so relate to your woes. I had a TT due to cancer in February and I have the same problem. I am 5'4 and weighed 186 lbs even though I ate less than 900 calories a day. I went to see my doctor and he prescribed Meridia which is slowly helping. I lost 7 lbs in 5 weeks even though I went on vacation and now the Holidays. So, I can say that it's working just very slowly. From what I understand at .03 (same TSH as myself) we are considered to be hyperactive, which is necessary for the suppression of the cancer, however, some people react by gaining weight if they are hypers. Most lose weight, but of course, it seems like you and I, we go the opposite way. Speak to your doctor and see if he will help you out. I kept a journal of what I ate for a week to prove to him that my caloric intake is very low. Good luck and hang in there. By the way, I also hated coffee before the TT and now I can't live without it or else I can't function. Oh well, things will never be the same again.",
