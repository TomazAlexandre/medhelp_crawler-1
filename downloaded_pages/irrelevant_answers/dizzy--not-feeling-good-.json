            "answer": "As you are on Metformin, I presume that you have diabetes.You must make an appointment to see your doctor as soon as possible.Take a morning urine sample with you when you go.Your sugar levels may not be controlled properly by the Metformin or may have dropped too low making you feel ill.Is there any possibility of you being pregnant?It is important for you to see your doctor to check your sugar levels, and send a blood test to check the HAB1C sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0This shows the percentage sugar level over a 12 week period and by this the doctor will be able to see how well you have been controlling your diabetes.If your sugar levels are not right that can make you feel tired and very sleepy and also if you have anaemia.\u00a0\u00a0I presume that as you are on folic acid this was given to you to help the absorption of iron.Your nausea and stomach problems may be connected with the Metformin or through a stomach bug.It is also important whilst taking Metformin to regularly (usually once a year) to have your kidney function checked.\u00a0\u00a0This is done by a blood test; your doctor may request for that to be done at the same time.Hope you get sort out soon.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "If the doctor prescribed you with the Metformin to control your sugar levels, it is a bad idea to stop taking the medication without the doctor's advice.You were given the Metformin for a reason and that would have been that your sugar levels have been too high over a period of time.\u00a0\u00a0Having high sugar levels can cause all sorts of problems, from nerve damage, eye damage, kidney failure and amputations due to poor circulation.\u00a0\u00a0So it is very important that you take the medication as prescribed as eat sensibly.I was started on Metformin 500mg a week ago and I find I am fine.\u00a0\u00a0I take the medication after my evening meal as prescribed.\u00a0\u00a0I have been glucose intolerant for a number of years, but my last average reading went into the diabetic range.Uncontrolled sugar levels can make you feel tired and sleepy as well as if you have anaemia.Make sure that you are eating sensibly, cutting out all refined, processed and junk foods and fizzy drinks.\u00a0\u00a0Drink more water.\u00a0\u00a0Cut out highly spiced and fried foods.\u00a0\u00a0For the nausea try drinking some camomile or mint tea, have an arrowroot biscuit or a piece of dried toast, apples should be fine too.Make an appointment to see your doctor and get your urine and blood tested for pregnancy and to check your average sugar levels, that is the first step and then take things from there.Best wishes.",
