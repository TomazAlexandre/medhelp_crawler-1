            "answer": "Your TSH is low, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have Graves.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is a pituitary hormone and can vary considerably at different times.\u00a0\u00a0Based only on the TSH test, yes, it would seem that you are \"over active\", at this point, but we'd need to see the test results for the T3 and T4.Please post the actual results of the T3 and T4 tests, along with the reference ranges from the lab report, as these ranges vary from lab to lab, so must come from your own report.\u00a0\u00a0Also, please indicate whether they are for FREE T3 and FREE T4 or if they are for Total T3 and Total T4, as that makes a huge difference.Which antibodies were you tested for and have you had a thyroid ultra sound to determine whether or not you have nodules on your thyroid?If you are negative for Graves antibodies (determined by TSI test), you could have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (determined by *both* TPOab and TGab tests).While Graves is most often associated with being hyper and Hashimoto's most often associated with being hypo, some with Hashimoto's swing from hyper to hypo, particularly, if you have nodules on your thyroid.Please post whatever test results you have, so we can further assess your situation and comment further.",
