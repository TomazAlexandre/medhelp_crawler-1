            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism or due to liver problems. In women polycystic disease of the ovary too should be ruled out as it causes insulin resistance and fatigue.Another possibility is sleep disturbances. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

Just like daily thing i use to do i don't even feel like doing and kind of like i have a lack of motivation too.
