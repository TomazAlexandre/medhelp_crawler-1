            "answer": "Hi!To start any drug, a doctor must have sufficient reason to do so, and the drug should not be more harmful than the disease it is being used to treat. Drugs used to treat obesity have a lot of side effect. Hence, they are restricted for those who are morbidly obese. In these people the hazards of being morbidly obese outweigh the hazards of taking the drug.If you want to lose weight, common causes of weight gain like overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, hypothyroidism have to be ruled out in your case. You must then look for other causes. One is water retention due to low serum protein. This along with anemia can cause unexplained weight gain. Adrenal gland problems are the other cause. Cushing\u2019s syndrome should be looked for. The kidney function too should be assessed. Late night snacking and poor sleep too can cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary (in women) too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain.If all these causes are ruled out then you can start a diet and exercise program to lose weight. If you want to lose weight, then you must do it the scientific way for long term benefits, healthy glow, and a good physique and body. It's best to join a nutrition expert and a physical trainer and follow their advice. Incorporating yoga into this regimen takes stress out of this exercise to lose weight. Also the diet should contain more of green leafy vegetables, fruits and protein and less of spaghetti, potato etc.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you eat frequent small meals and stop counting calories. It is best to eat lots of fruits and non-starchy green veggies, go slow on fats, eat carbohydrates in moderation and increase your protein intake (lean cuts, whites of eggs etc). Drink plenty of water and non fattening fluids such as clear soups etc. Look for hidden calories in salads and soups and avoid them (eg: cheese, butter, dressings etc).Also, you need to exercise regularly. A combination of aerobic, strength training and stretches works best. Many people find it difficult to fit an exercise regimen into their lives. The best way is to join a gym. If that is not possible, try building exercise into your daily life. If you lead a busy life, then walk to work, or to bus stand etc, climb stairs instead of using lifts, walk while talking on cell phone, or briskly walk to any place you are going to. See how you can change your lifestyle to incorporate exercise. Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "Great advice Dr. Mathur. for the benefit of alexalan I want to add a bit to the discussion. Weight gain can be complicated. Our weight will fluctuate and it may never have anything to do with a fat cell or the hypertrophy of them. Water weight plays a large role when you look at a scale weight. For example, when a person goes on a low carbohydrate diet they will lose weight very quickly, there will be fat loss and water loss. If you look at the word carbohydrate...the word hydrate is attached to the word. So our scale weights are intimately tied to our carbohydrate consumption. When someone loses 7 lbs in 7 days, it is physiologically impossible for that to be all fat. So how much of that is water, fat, muscle etc..This goes the same for weight gain, if I gain 5 lbs in a week it is physiologically impossible for that to be fat. The scale can lie but sometimes tell the truth...we just don't typically know when that happens. This is just an addition to the protein comment. When I weigh people I make sure I evaluate their water weekly, with that protocol you can almost predict what the scale is going to read week per week. Take the scale out of the equation...just make sure you are on a plan that guarantees you see change..then the best evaluator is whether you are doing the plan or not..don't leave the interpretation to the scale!",

    "question": "Why are medical doctors so hesitant about helping those of us who are overweight?\u00a0\u00a0There are many new medications out there that can help dull the part of the brain that causes food cravings and/or constant hunger.\u00a0\u00a0Please help us avoid Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Cancer, Heart Problems, Joint Problems, etc.\u00a0\u00a0There is help out there, is anyone listening to us?",
