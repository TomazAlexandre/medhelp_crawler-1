            "answer": "Hello,Bile salts from the liver give stool its brownish color. If there is decreased bile output, stool is much lighter in color.There are various possibilities for paleness of stools like biliary diseases(obstruction,decreased synthesis, cholecystitis, gallstones,biliary cancer) , liver pathologies(like viral hepatitis,cirrhosis) , pancreatic disorders(pancreatitis,pancreatic cancer) , giardia parasitic infection,cystic fibrosis , celiac disease\u00a0\u00a0and topical sprue.Are you having any other associated symptom or sign?In my opinion,you should consult a gastroenterologist and get these possibilities ruled out one by one.Investigations like blood tests,stool examination,ultrasound,ct scan abdomen and pancreatic enzymes are needed to confirm a diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
