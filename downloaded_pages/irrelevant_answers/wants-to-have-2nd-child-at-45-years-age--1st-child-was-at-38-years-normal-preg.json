            "answer": "Hi How is your health is now?You did't post that.As to your question you could develop gestational diabietes,then you baby would be large.Taking fertility blends for three months I don't know,I'm not familar with that.You need to talk to your doctor,he or she can give you more information on that better than I can.Maybe somebody else on this forum might know about it.But I don't.I just know about the risks for getting pregnant at an older age.The higher risks there are for the fetus to develop down syndrome,your doctor will check you quite often and you will have more follow up appointments than a regular prenatal patient.But that is what you would need.As I am sure that is what he or she\u00a0\u00a0done the first time.I hope this helps maybe you will get more posts from some one smarter than me,sorry.TNT406.",
