            "answer": "Here's my 2 cents. Your glucose [blood sugar] levels are unusual. Normally, levels increase and plateau around the 1 hrs mark much higher than what you posted. At 2hrs normal people usually see <120 mg/dl, then at 3 hrs between 70-99 mg/dl. What I didn't see mentioned was if you were tested prior to the OGTT [Oral Glucose Tolerance Test]. W/o knowing I'm just guessing that It appears as if you were in a hypoglycemic state when you took the test.You might ask for a referral to an Endocrinologist, a specialist trained on diabetes, thyroid and pancreas care and treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely ask to have your Thyroid and Pancreas completely tested, including an insulin test. An misfiring Thyroid will disrupt the Pancreas's insulin production, in your case might be to much insulin causing low levels. Good luck",

            "answer": "Thanks for both of your responses. I got my thyroid sugically removed in 2003 so have been taking thyroid supplements ever since.My symptoms recently have been:Weight gain. Dizzyness and confusion 2 hours after eating breakfast. Dry skin. Loosing my hair. (I used to have full beautiful hair) Brittle nails. I am CONSTANTLY thirsty which is leading me to urinate every 2 hours! I am very very healthy, I eat very good and run 2-3 miles every single day. I should not be gaining weight by any means. Usually when someone is hyperactive they lose weight. Seems to be the opposite for me. Looks like my T3 and T4 levels look great.I also got my thryroid levels checked last Friday as well. Below are the results. Looks like I have way too much levoxyl? I am currently taking:cytomel 5 mcg tablets twice a day and levoxyl 100 mcg once a dayGimel, do you have any insight on my thyroid? You have been such a great help with my thyroid. Thanks all!Thyroid levels:TSH: 0.42\u00a0\u00a0(0.34-4.82)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0uIU/mLThyroxine/T4: 11.0 (4.7-13.3) mcg/dLT3 Total: 179 (76-181) ng/dL",

Just had a bad experience with him. I am seeing a great physician now who is ruling things out finally. I will have them test my FT3 and FT4. What is the difference between that and T3 and T4. I thought for sure I was getting all the tests necessary for thyroid. I will request those two done asap. I believe cutting my llevoxyl in half daily will be the answer.Super_sally, that may be it. I eat salads and very healthy food rather than fat and protein. I always eat very low fat low calorie foodsThanks all.",
