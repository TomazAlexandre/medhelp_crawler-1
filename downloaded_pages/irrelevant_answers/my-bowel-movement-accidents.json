            "answer": "I suffer from Ulcerative Colitis and this has happened to me before. But I have the symptoms all the time, as in I am always running to the bathroom 24/7, 365... My suggestion is try and get an appointment at a Hospital with a Gastro specialist, as when I went to my GP they had no clue either. At the hosp they should give you examinations such as colonoscopy/endoscopy, barium meal, scans, etc and it should show something up.Then again I have had all these things done and nothing has been fixed yet. Best of luck to you!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Pelvic floor dysfunction, damage to the anal sphincter muscles or nerves of the anal sphincter muscles or the rectum, diarrhea, constipation, and loss of storage capacity in the rectum are a few causes of fecal incontinence or inability to hold stools. Hence IBS should definitely be looked at.Do discuss this with your gynecologist and get yourself examined. In all probability you have a weak pelvic floor. Kegel exercises may help. Take care!",
