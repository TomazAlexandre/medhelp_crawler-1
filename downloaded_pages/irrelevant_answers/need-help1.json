            "answer": "Sally is correct about diet, weight and exercise. These are the number one priorities in controlling diabetes, the guidelines to adhere too. Metformin is used to help assist with controlling glucose levels as long as one is following the guidelines of diabetes control. Glucophage is the proper name for Metformin. The RX stands for extended release. In other words, its like time release where the medicine remains longer in the body. Lifestyle change is needed, not change of medicine. Good luck.",
