            "answer": "Hi.There are a lot of conditions that could present with muscle twitching in multiple body areas. However, some of them are less likely to occur in your age group, such as Parkinson's disease.Conditions that may explain your symptoms include vitamin and mineral deficiencies, thyroid disorders, diabetes, and benign fasciculation syndrome. Anxiety disorder and depression can sometimes lead to somatic symptoms or could exacerbate the muscle twitching.You should talk to your doctors about these possibilities.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "In many cases the anxiety causes the symptoms you are describing. Some people have them AFTER recovered from heart attack. If you can focus on something else and and not have these symptoms until you thought about them, then it points to the anxiety.Are you allergic to all vegetables and fruits?BTW I am allergic to sertin deodorants and parfumes.",

    "question": "I am a 19 year old female. I have asthma, allergies, scoliosis, an anxiety disorder, a cardiac arrhythmia, OCD, and occasional deppression.\u00a0\u00a0About six months ago I started to experience muscle twitching in my thighs, arms, abdominal muscles, buttocks, calves, lips, and the sides of my tongue. I am not experiencing weakness but I occasionally will have pain in my calves and thighs.\u00a0\u00a0I have 3 doctors that I've tried to explain this to but the best any of them has done for me is send me to physical therapy.\u00a0\u00a0It did not work.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if the muscle twitching is something serious or if it's from a combination of my somewhat poor mental health and from not being able to eat fruits and vegetables because of my severe allergies to both.\u00a0\u00a0I know I will not find a diagnosis here but I would just like to have some input on the possible causes of muscle twitching in someone my age.Thank you.",
