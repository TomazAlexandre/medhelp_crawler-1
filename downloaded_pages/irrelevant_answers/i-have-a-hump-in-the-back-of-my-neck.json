    "question": "Recently I have noticed that I have a hump in the back of my neck. It doesn't matter if I correct my posture the hump remains. It comes and it goes as I lose and gain weight, however, I've always had it.Right now I am 5'6 and weight about 170 to 180 lbs and the hump is more noticeable than ever.I've attached some photos so that you guys can see what it is.What is this thing and how can I make it go away?http://img.photobucket.com/albums/v720/GeorgieLikesWine/hump3.jpghttp://img.photobucket.com/albums/v720/GeorgieLikesWine/hump1.jpg",
