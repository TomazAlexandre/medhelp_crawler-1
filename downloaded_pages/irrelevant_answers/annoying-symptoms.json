            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The bladder pressure can be due to residual infection. I suggest you stop all antibiotics for 2 days. Then give a urine sample for culture and sensitivity. This will identify the causative organism and the antibiotic that will be effective against it. Taking this antibiotic in appropriate dose and duration will take care of the infection.Also persistent vaginal thrush can cause urinary infection too. After giving the urine sample you need to take care of that.Yeast infection or thrush is at times very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks along with local application of antifungal cream. There are many types of antifungals available. Take an OTC antifungal with a combination of two or more anti fungals. Use both oral and local application. At times both partners need to be treated. Provided it is indeed fungus, then only try this. Antifungal tablets are strong medicines and should not be taken otherwise. So start with cream and if it helps, start the tablet. Various reasons for recurrent fungal infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Discuss this with your gynecologist.Possibility of a STD should be looked into. Take care!",
