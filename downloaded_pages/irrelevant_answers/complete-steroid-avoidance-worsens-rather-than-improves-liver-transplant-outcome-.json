            "answer": "Liver Transpl. 2008 Apr;14(4):512-25.Steroid avoidance in liver transplantation: meta-analysis and meta-regression of randomized trials.Segev DL, Sozio SM, Shin EJ, Nazarian SM, Nathan H, Thuluvath PJ, Montgomery RA, Cameron AM, Maley WR.Department of Surgery, The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD 21287, USA. ***@****Steroid use after liver transplantation (LT) has been associated with diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, obesity, and hepatitis C (HCV) recurrence. We performed meta-analysis and meta-regression of 30 publications representing 19 randomized trials that compared steroid-free with steroid-based immunosuppression (IS). There were no differences in death, graft loss, and infection. Steroid-free recipients demonstrated a trend toward reduced hypertension [relative risk (RR) 0.84, P = 0.08], and statistically significant decreases in cholesterol (standard mean difference -0.41, P < 0.001) and cytomegalovirus (RR 0.52, P = 0.001). In studies where steroids were replaced by another IS agent, the risks of diabetes (RR 0.29, P < 0.001), rejection (RR 0.68, P = 0.03), and severe rejection (RR 0.37, P = 0.001) were markedly lower in steroid-free arms. In studies in which steroids were not replaced, rejection rates were higher in steroid-free arms (RR 1.31, P = 0.02) and reduction of diabetes was attenuated (RR 0.74, P = 0.2). HCV recurrence was lower with steroid avoidance and, although no individual trial reached statistical significance, meta-analysis demonstrated this important effect (RR 0.90, P = 0.03). However, we emphasize the heterogeneity of trials performed to date and, as such, do not recommend basing clinical guidelines on our conclusions. We believe that a large, multicenter trial will better define the role of steroid-free regimens in LT. (c) 2008 AASLD.PMID: 18383081 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINEMike",

            "answer": "Interesting information and, as usual, no rigid conclusions. I had steroids post TP and it did play havoc with my blood sugar. Long term, it seems I have suffered no ill effects. Now, my glucose is pretty normal, cholesterol low, BP fine. Hep C did come back early and agressively, though.",

    "question": "{.......Although recurrence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) was comparable between the 2 groups (48% receiving standard therapy vs 30% receiving steroid avoidance; P = .07), clinicians observed more graft fibrosis in the patients not receiving steroids (2.6 \u00b1 0.5 Ishak score vs 1.5 \u00b1 0.2 Ishak score; P = .05).Dr. Pelletier was particularly surprised that steroid avoidance failed to prevent HCV-related cirrhosis. \"The recurrence of HCV may lead to cirrhosis in the allograft as soon as 5 to 10 years following liver transplant,\" Dr. Pelletier acknowledged. \"It was our hope that complete steroid avoidance would help limit this problem, but preliminary results suggest that the rate of fibrosis may actually be increased in the steroid-free group.\"....}See: http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/577496?src=mp&spon=29&uac=39980BGYou must be registered at Medscape to view but registration is free and easy and well worth the time.Mike",
