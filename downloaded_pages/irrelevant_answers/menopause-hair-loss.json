            "answer": "Hello,I also had a thick head of hair and actually it was my crowning glory.\u00a0\u00a0In 1991, I was diagnosed with Adult onset type 1 diabetes, hypothroidism (low) and BiPolar...all at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0What got me to the doc originally was that for about two weeks my hair would fall out every morning when I brushed it.\u00a0\u00a0It covered the sink!\u00a0\u00a0I was mortified.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I went on a throid med, insulin and lithium.\u00a0\u00a0It was a very traumatic time.\u00a0\u00a0My hormones were all over the place.\u00a0\u00a0I had been peri-menopausal for about 6 years before this happened.\u00a0\u00a0Hot flashes and night sweats were terrible.\u00a0\u00a0I am here today at 61 and I still take insulin for my diabetes ( which is and has always been \"Brittle\"), I still take a small dose of levothyroxine (synthroid, it's all the same type of med) but I'm not taking the lithium.\u00a0\u00a0If I forget to take the levothyroxine in the morning, I really feel it.\u00a0\u00a0I get very fatigued and my legs have a difficult time holding me up.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, I am, unfortunately still experiencing all of those night sweats and hot flashes. Because of my health history, I cannot go on HRT.\u00a0\u00a0 I am at the point that I am considering going to a compounding pharmasist to take a look at the whole hormonal situation.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, other than the expense, it couldn't be any worse, ha ha.The gist of the story is that I still have thinning hair and it's affected my nails too. making then thin and brittle.\u00a0\u00a0I did get some relief when using Nioxin, but it takes about 4-6 months before you start seeing improvement.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, I would recommend it even now. It's a little pricey, but worth it.\u00a0\u00a0 But one more thing I would recommend.\u00a0\u00a0Start taking Biotin.\u00a0\u00a0It is a nutritional supplement.\u00a0\u00a0It has stopped my hair from falling out.\u00a0\u00a0It has not brought back the level of hair growth that I had at the beginning, but I do see little fuzz sprouting all over my head.\u00a0\u00a0As far as the doseage, I take 5,000 Mcg every night.\u00a0\u00a0While I can't recommend that much, I would suggest that you go to a nutritional or vitamin store and talk with them.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you get someone who knows what they are talking about.\u00a0\u00a0Alot of sales people in those stores just don't have the expertise.\u00a0\u00a0I would also recommend you check Biotin on the internet or the library.One last question for you.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have other family members that have experiened hair loss or thinning?\u00a0\u00a0The reason I ask this is that it just might be herititary.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, both my father, brother and everyone on my mother's side of the family have/had it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm trying not to feel like I'm doomed.\u00a0\u00a0But I use a little beauty magic.\u00a0\u00a0My hair is dark brown and my scalp is white so the bald spots really show.\u00a0\u00a0My hair started turning white when I was 18.\u00a0\u00a0I not only color it every 5-6 weeks, but I also use hair color spray in dark brown to cover not only the balding spots, but also the white scalp.\u00a0\u00a0It washes out easily and you can get it at any beauty supply store.I hope this gives you some information that was helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Keep the faith.\u00a0\u00a0When all else fails and I am feeling very vulnerable about the hair loss, I put on a wig!\u00a0\u00a0Keep writing and let us know how you are doing.",

            "answer": "As I was entering into peri menopause my hair started falling out similar to yours. I was told it was a hormonal issue. My blood tests showed I was peri menopause.\u00a0\u00a0Bio identical hormones took care of that.But I've also heard that other hormonal imbalances can cause hair loss.\u00a0\u00a0An endocrinologist can do test to check out all yoru other hormones. Vitamin D deficiency is\u00a0\u00a0one test they tend to over look so have them do that as well.\u00a0\u00a0I've read that well over 50% of women have Vitamin D deficiency.",
