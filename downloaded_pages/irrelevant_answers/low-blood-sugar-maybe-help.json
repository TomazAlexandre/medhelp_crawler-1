I could only keep down sweets and stuff like that and when I tried eating meat or something I just got super sick. I'm 31 weeks tomorrow and my baby is completely healthy and when I had my 1 hour glucose testing it was normal too. I guess it's a stage in most pregnant women",

Like fainting, dizziness, headaches, rapid heart, diarrhea, of course vomiting, etc. So that's why I thought maybe it's my blood sugar. Can it drop really low randomly?? If so does it go back fast?",

    "question": "Hi I'm 24 weeks and 4 days. Lately I have only been able to keep sweet foods down. Like cake, cookies, grapes, doughnuts, lemonade, flavored water that taste like fruit punch, gatorade, etc. Everything else like meat and vegetables or things that are not sweet in any way I get very sick. The only thing I am craving is chocolate very strongly. Could this be bc my blood sugar is low? Or diabetes?",
