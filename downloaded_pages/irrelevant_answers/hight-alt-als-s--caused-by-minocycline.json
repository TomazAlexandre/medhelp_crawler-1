            "answer": "Although it may be possible that minocycline can raise the liver function levels, it would be unlikely that 3 doses can.The AST/ALT ratio that you have can be caused by alcohol use.I would also consider a liver ultrasound in addition to the tests that your doctor has ordered.It is also possible for an enlarged liver to create downward pressure, leading to urinary frequency.There can be other causes of urinary frequency, including infection and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0These options can be evaluated with a urinalysis as well as blood tests looking for the various types of diabetes (both mellitus and insipidus).These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "I should also mention that I do drink on occasion with a lot of my friends who are still in college, but I have not had a drink in over a week because of my rough new schedule.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to that I usually stuck to Friday/Saturday drinking, maybe 6 beers at the most per day over a period of about 6 hours.",

            "answer": "Primarily you have 2 issues that are High ALT levels & Frequency. In my personal opinion both are separate, not connected & need to be treated differently.Minocycline in the dose you mentioned in my opinion can very rarely cause that high ALTs & hepatomegaly.Ultrasound is a good diagnostic tool both to detect hepatomegaly & early cirrhotic changes if any.If you do have hepatomegaly ultrasound would detect it & its size.Get a viral work out done to find the cause of your raised ALTs, although alcohol consumption is a contributory factor, for that in my opinion GGT levels are more specific than ALTs. ALT is a sign of liver cell injury from what ever the cause whether viruses, drugs, alcohol etc.In my opinion you need a CT to look for any other mass effects (apart from hepatomegaly if present) on the urogenital system.Hepatomegaly even if supposing present, cannot be the sole culprit of producing mass pressure effects in your case. Actual cause of frequency could be lower done in the urogenital tract.Try discussing with your doc to consider Irritable Bladder/ Dextrusor Instability as a cause of frequency.In my opinion Micturating studies should be carried out too, to see the amount of post void urine, along with other things.",

            "answer": "If I were you, I would abstain from alcohol for about 4 or 5 weeks and then have the ALT and AST tests repeated.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking 6 beers twice a week could cause raised levels, as can tylenol and many over the counter and prescription drugs.\u00a0\u00a0 Being overweight can also cause liver enzymes to rise.\u00a0\u00a0 Just something to consider.\u00a0\u00a0 Good luck and keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 26 yr old male, 6'2\" and a little overweight (not obese however) I have had a problem with frequent urges to urinate the past week or so, this is causing a HUGE problem at work because I started a new job, only 2 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0I am having trouble focusing because I always feel like I am going to wet my pants, and have to disrupt meetings to go to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0Usually only a small amount of urine comes out, so I was concerned and went to my doctor.My doctor put me through some tests, diabetes was negative, checked my prostate (OUCH!) and that was fine.\u00a0\u00a0He was unsure what could be causing it so he gave me some blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0Upon finding out the results he said my AST and ALT levels were high (130 and 83 respectively) and sent me in for more blood tests for Mono and Hepititis.\u00a0\u00a0He said that an enlarged liver may be causing me to feel like I need to urinate when I am seated.I realized later in the day after hearing the results however that I had been given some Minocycline a month before for a possible tick bite.\u00a0\u00a0In my confusion caused by the new job I had forgotten to take them, realized it the other day and took the recomended dose (2x day) the day before and the morning of the blood test. (the doctor instructed me to take ALL of them until they were gone).\u00a0\u00a0 When the blood was taken I forgot to mention this to the doctor, and I dont believe he realized I was still on them.\u00a0\u00a0So after my long explanation here are my questions:Would 3 tablets of 100MG Minocycline within 48 hours of the blood test cause elevated AST/ALT #s like this?andWould levels like this indicate an enlarged liver which would cause me to have frequent (every 10-20 mins) urges to urinate?Thank you for taking the time to read this, I look forward to your responses.If you have any further questions to determine your answer or would like more information please contact me at ***@****Thank you again.",
