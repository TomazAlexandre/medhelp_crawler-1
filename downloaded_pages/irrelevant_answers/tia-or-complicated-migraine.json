            "answer": "Hi,How are you? The symptoms and signs of a TIA usually resolve after a few hours. However, diagnostic tests such as ECG, head CT scan or brain MRI may help rule out stroke, which may present with the same symptoms. Normally, these tests are normal. Other diagnostic tests to check high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol, and other causes of and risk factors for TIAs or stroke may also be done. If you have history of migraine headaches, you need to check with your neurologist also to determine if hemiplegic migraine is present. This type of migraine also present with numbness and confusion. Take care and do keep us posted.",
