            "answer": "I am a volunteer and the mom of a type one diabetic on an insulin pump.\u00a0\u00a0I totally understand your problem.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is very slender and does not have a lot of fat on her body.She uses her butt cheeks, her belly about an inch past her belly button on either side, the top of her thighs, and the back of her upper arms in the fatty part.\u00a0\u00a0 We rotate the sites so that by the time she gets back to the first sight it is healed enough.You did not state what type of the site you are using we find that the silhouette site is best for her slender body as it goes in sideways not straight so it hurts less and does not hit muscle that easily.As for absorption, if you use your legs and arms a lot the absorption will be quicker then than in other spots.I would suggest you talk to your pump trainer to see if they have any other tips for the site to be more comfortable.I hope this helps.",

    "question": "Hello, my name is Jon and I am 24 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I have had Type 1 diabetes for 23 years now and just finally got onto the pump about 4 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0I am slender and very lean on body fat.\u00a0\u00a0With a high metabolism and some recent complications with my diabetes, I have lost a lot of weight.\u00a0\u00a0I tried the pump about 2 years ago and was not able to find any insertion areas as when I inserted it, it felt like it was rubbing directly on my muscle.\u00a0\u00a0However, this time, it seems to be ok.\u00a0\u00a0I have been inserting the pump in more my buttocks and my hip area as that seems to be the most comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I tried my stomack and it worked once, but the second time, I tried it on the other side and it hurt and was uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like I am running out of areas to put the darn thing and I am worried this may cause more complications than what it is worth.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any ideas or suggestions about finding comfortable insertion areas and where the best absorbtion is.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
