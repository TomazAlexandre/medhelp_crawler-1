            "answer": "Feeling depressed after a break up is normal. Feeling suicidal is of concern. I would speak to a psychiatrist and of course talk therapist as well. After some time of seperation then you can seek other relationships. Its not pleasent but its unfortunately part of life. Your feelings are understandable and I sympathize but they are only hurting you as well. As for depression it is of course treatable and any event like this will make it worse. Speak to someone before things get out of hand.",
