Since median nerve is responsible for feeling and movement of the palm, thumb, index, middle finger and the thumb side of the ring finger, these areas may be affected. You have been engaged in repetitive hand and wrist movements, which can trigger the onset. The numbness, tingling and pain over palms, pain can extend to the elbow and interfere with finger movement with weakness of grip. Your physician should check for diabetes, hypothyroidism, as these may be associated. Apart from clinical examination, electromyography and nerve conduction test may be done. You can try hot and cold compresses, splint, and change of nature of work for some time, over the counter painkillers and corticosteroids injections given into the carpal tunnel area helps. Wishing you all the best.",
