            "answer": "That shows its not working as it should. But it is the antipsychotic that's an available medication with the least side effects. At a standard clinical dose of it you should not have auditory hallucinations (\"hear voices\"). Its good to have coping strategies for remaining symptoms but that's big one and one medication is supposed to eliminate. I have made a full recovery from schizoaffective disorder. The adjunct antipsychotic I am taking that is experimental Zofran is an approved medication and I know some psychopharmcologists would consider that as an adjunct (in addition) to the Abilify even though its an off label use. The primary antipsychotic I am taking is in Phase II FDA study and is glycine, a glutamate antagonist, a new form of antipsychotic that promotes a fuller recovery and cannot cause tardive dyskinesia or diabetes. My study will be published by my psychopharmocologist in a standard psychiatric journal and when it is I'll make it available to people here. You can read through my posts through more information. In the meantime google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\" and you can print that out for your psychiatrist as well as any post or journal I did as they are in the public domain. If you want a psychiatrist who is familiar with medications that are off label or experimental (I know for a fact other psychiatrists are using Zofran as an adjunct) you should obtain a refer to a psychopharmocologist.",
