            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. White matter lesions in MRI could be due to various causes, esp. with risk factors like diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol levels, if you are a smoker, since all these can cause small vessel disease. Plaques are quite typical of MS, which is a demyelinating disease of the nervous system with clinical features like visual blurring due to optic neuritis, decline in cognitive function and memory loss, numbness and spastic weakness in limbs. Diagnosis would depend on the criteria set for MS and includes MRI brain and spine, csf analysis and visual, somatosensory evoked potentials. You would need your neurologist to assimilate your symptoms with investigations. Best wishes to you.",
