            "answer": "Hi!No, do not cut your calorie intake by half. Slowly reduce your calorie intake so that you can stick to the reduction. If you have a back problem then first ask a physical trainer what type of exercises you can do. If you can bicycle or swim, it would be best for you. Also, consult your doctor to rule out any medical cause of weight gain such as diabetes or hypothyroidism. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
