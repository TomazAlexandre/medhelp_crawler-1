            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of increased frequency of urination is UTI, both due to a STD and non STD infection. However increased frequency of urine is also seen in diabetis mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Small for size bladder is another cause and so also neurogenic bladder. Another possibility is a polyp or a growth inside the urethra. At times a hair too grows inwards and keeps tickling the urethra causing a need to urinate. A frenulum tag too can cause this type of sensation.You must talk to your physician regarding all these possibilities. You would need some more tests beside urine analysis to reach a confirmed diagnosis. Take care!",

    "question": "OK, so i have had this going on for about a year now..... and lately its just starting to get on my nerves. At first it didnt bother me, it was still there though, but now that i am trying to get rid of it, its been getting worse. It alwasy feels like i need to pee. I have been to the doctor for a bladder infection, took pills, they didnt work. Then i went to get checked for stds. I was clean. I thought it would be one because i got it right after sex. Then right now i am on pills for a uti, which those arnt working either. If anyone can give me some feedback that would be great. It isnt bad when i am sitting down, only when walking around. It goes away when i have an erection/ during sex. When i drink a lot it feels like not that much is coming out at a given point in time in comparision to how much i drank.",
