            "answer": "Hi;I am 13 weeks post opp of a Complete Thyroidectomy/Parathyroidectomy-Tumor.\u00a0\u00a0I have Hashimoto's, I am Hypoparathyroid, also Hypocalcemia.While the ENT was removing my Thyroid, a surprise marble size Parathyroid-Tumor popped out.\u00a0\u00a0All 6 of my doctors that had been treating for the past few years and all of the Nucular Med Scan, MRI's, and several Ultra Sounds, etc and the Tumor was never discovered.After surgery my calcium level dropped to very dangerous levels and was in the hospital an extened length of time.\u00a0\u00a0While in the hospital and sence....\u00a0\u00a0I have been taking 1000mg of calcium 3x's a day.\u00a0\u00a0Then two days after leaving the hospital I ended up in the ER.\u00a0\u00a0I experienced a very strong like electricity start in my feet, up my legs through to my back...\u00a0\u00a0in just seconds which was quickly followed by cramping so bad I could not bend my leggs for several seconds. My chest was tight and short of breathe too.\u00a0\u00a0My husbad rushed me to the ER, my calcium was low 7.6. The ER Endo on call explained that I could take all the calcium in the world and it would not absorb without taking Calcitrol.\u00a0\u00a0So I have been taking the same regiman of calcium since surgery and the Calcitrol...\u00a0\u00a0my calcium finally reached the lowest normal range. And my PTH (Parathyroid Hormones) were normal too.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks ago, my ENDO had me start cutting back on the Calcitrol, taking 1 everyother day instead of daily and my calcium immediately dropped below normal.I had prior to the Calcitrol dose change and even worse when trying to change the dose.... the very symptoms that you \"jeriRN\" explained in above posting. And they usually worsen in the night hours.Don't mess around....\u00a0\u00a0 with the low calcium it can and will effect your heart too!Make sure you don't miss your calcium doses....\u00a0\u00a0and don't delay getting labs done, could be low Magnesium level too.Take care;\u00a0\u00a0Sonflower",
