            "answer": "I hesitate to make predictions as I'm not a doctor and it sounds like your son has a complex medical picture. But I can understand your wanting some ideas of what may lie ahead if he has diabetes. The good news for someone so young is that they are doing research and finding new information all the time, working on several promising areas and diabetes care has already come a long ways in recent years. If your son does in fact have Type I diabetes there is a lot of support in the real world for parents with Type 1 children, when he gets older there is even diabetes camp for kids so they can have fun, learn about their condition and meet others like themselves. To treat Type 1 diabetes there are basically two different options, what we call MDIs (multiple daily injections) and insulin pumps which are set to control insulin flow over the day and are worn next to the body. I think many young people in time get pumps as they give better blood sugar control and can allow a more normal life without the need for injections several times a day.If your son has Type 1 diabetes, your (and his) life will change, there is no doubt about that. You will have a lot to learn at first and that is always stressfull. One thing you will have to do is make changes in how he eats, and the good news is that he is young enough to make that a bit easier.After you get over that initial learning curve, the goal becomes keeping his blood sugars in range with allowing him to live as normal a life as possible. I absolutely believe that a good medical team is essential (especially at first), but so is support from others, both your friends and family and maybe just as important, what will become your \"diabetic family\", in your case, other parents like yourself. There are lots of sites out there with a lot more regular input from people managing their own diabetes. I am not allowed to post other websites so I'm sending you a private message.",

            "answer": "If you've heard good things about the docs there and it's where his other docs are (which means they can easily confer), sounds like a good place to go. Then you can see if you feel good about the endocrinologist after you start working with him/her.Yes, having food on your hand can influence numbers. I once took my usual blood sugar and got a reading in the 400s and before I screamed in shock I remembered I'd been spreading (sugar free) jam and hadn't washed my hands. Always important to wash (and then dry) his hands before testing.Hang in there and I'll be anxious to hear how it goes.Zoe",

I really don't want something to be wrong with him but I am concerned about the difference in numbers.Twice when I have tested his fasting he was 99 and 93.So he has had low numbers with me too and he has also had 122,148 and 133.Please could you help me.I appreciate all the help and support you have given me.",

When I was diagnosed I was 8.1% The majority of the time I have been 6-6.8% I was as low as 5.4% but that was during my pregnancy. I would be pleased if I had your son's b/s.

If you still are concerned about blood sugar, it can't hurt to limit sugar consumption (children today eat way to much sugar and junk food anyway imho!). Good luck on finding out what is going on with your son's health and I hope it is something minor leading to a healthy and happy New Year for your little guy (my great niece was just 2 and it's an amazing age!)",

    "question": "My son is 2 1/2.I was concerned that he was having low blood sugar as he would demand a drink or food in the morning as soon as he opened his eyes.I have hypoglycemia.I was diagnosed earlier this year.I asked his dr about it and he said to go ahead and test him first thing in the morning when he wakes up.so I tested him this morning and his level was 169.he had not eaten or drank anything since 8pm the night before.So would I be correct in calling that a fasting glucose level? My concern is that the dr told me the safe levels are between 50-100.He is well above that.Is this something to be concerned about? He does have 2 bad heart valves as well so he is not your average child.he is growing well.He has been sick for as while now with fever of unknown origin.we are still trying to get to the bottom of this.But now I am concerned about his sugar levels.Please can someone advise me on this.If you read my posts on recurring fevers for children then you will know what we have been going through the last 7 months.Thanks in advance.",
