    "question": "So this morning I went in for my 37 wk check up. My doctor checked my cervix and asked if I wanted to be stripped, which I said sure since she has only measured my belly past appts but not done anything internally. Anyways she told me my cervix was about 1 and a half cm and that I wasn't deep enough to get stripped. But now I'm curious to what that means to get stripped?P.S. she warned me that I would probably spot after checking my cervix which i Did. Even though she warned me I couldn't help but feel scared when I saw blood in the toilet (sorry if TMI). Lol is just a scary feeling after many months of not having a period and knowing you're pregnant to all of sudden see blood.",
