            "answer": "Your symptoms sound similar to mine. I got very sick 3 yrs ago. It started out with severe pain all over and fatigue. Then, the real pain came. It started in my feet and gradually asended up my body a foot at a time. Every time I woke up, it was a foot higher and I slept for 2-3 days in a row. I twitched so badly, that whatever was in my hand flew across the room. I had electrical headaches that woke me up at night along with severe night sweats that made me so cold. I have shooting pains that go up my arms now. I became so fatigued and weak at one point, I couldn't move my extremities. I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia at first, but now my doctors call me a mystery. I have a high ANA, RNA antibodies, tested positive for Parvovirus and Epstein Barre virus. EMG said carpal tunnel in left arm and mildly abnormal in left legs. I have severe cold, freezing pain in feet and legs. My muscles feel like I've been working out and the pain is like a burning pain. It's hard to discribes, but it's like the pain when your working out and you have to stop lifting weights bc it hurts to bad to keep going. MRI showed flashes of white matter, EMG normal but I had a seizure type thing in front of my neurologist. My sleep study was really abnormal and showed terrible daytime sleepiness. I went into REM sleep within 2-5 min every time they had me go to sleep during the day. I have many other symptoms. I can't get my doctors to do a spinal tap though. I already have severe headaches and dizziness. I feel worse when I stand up so I'm bedridden and fatigued. My Lymes test was negative. Anyways, I just wanted you to know I feel the same way as you. Sick and frustrated. I just want a correct diagnosis.",
