    "question": "I know most of the questions here relate to weight loss but I needed for a while to gain weight and as it lowers to keep it at this rate but I want to make sure what is the healthy way to do it? My disability tardive akathesia causes me to remain in motion all the time so constant weight loss is a given. I went down to a weight that was too low according to my doctor but I drank Glucerna everyday and gained it back. I don't really want to have this every day for the rest of my life and I know there are many foods that will cause you to gain weight but I want to think of healthy ones because of the standard risks I want to keep down of having low cholesterol and not running into a problem with diabetes as well as a healthy diet overall. I know that having more dessert is not an option but what food groups that will help me gain weight are okay to bulk up on but not run into other problems?",
