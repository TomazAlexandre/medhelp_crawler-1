            "answer": "I, too, have diet/weight loss issues with my Hash. I put on 30 pounds in six months once I began my Synthroid treatment for my Hash. My doc said the weight gain wasn't related to thyroid, but had no other info on what it could be. I went to another doc who had me do extensive blood work\u00a0\u00a0incl. fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, etc. and it all came back normal. His suggestion was to see a bariatric doctor. That doc basically put me on Aktins, which didn't help my cholesterol. So, I went to a nutritionist who could help me with my cholesterol levels, but was clueless with regard to hypothyroid eating.\u00a0\u00a0All I can do at this point (I'm 40 and female) is exercise at least 30 minutes 5 times a week and eat very small healthy meals. I'm often told \"It could be things other than your thyroid, because it's not your thyroid/meds/etc. that's causing you to gain weight,\" but even after all those blood/urine/glucose tests, nothing was found. While there is no scientific classification for \"just the way it is,\" it is the reality of the situation. It will just take longer and be harder than for people with regular metabolisms. Don't beat yourself up--just take it one day at a time.",

    "question": "I am in need of some decent suggestions for a food plan.I have Hashimoto's and my endo just says to eat moderate portions, etc. I am having a horrible time losing weight- he says since my thyroid is well controlled (thank goodness) it is not my thyroid caising the weight issue. Any suggestions?",
