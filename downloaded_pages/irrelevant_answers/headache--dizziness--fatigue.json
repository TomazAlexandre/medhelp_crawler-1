            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you have is probably postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required.Other than that it could be compression of the spinal nerves in the cervical spine region. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, herniated disc, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. A MRI of the cervical spine and nerve conduction studies may be required. Please consult a neurologist. The treatment is to remove the compression. You have to discuss the best treatment option with a neurologist, which can range from medicines to physiotherapy to cervical collars or even surgery.What you can do is get blood examined close to the attack to see if you have hypoglycemia. In the same sample also test for anemia. Drink plenty of fluids and eat healthy.Do discuss this with a doctor (walk in clinic ?)\u00a0\u00a0and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello,\u00a0\u00a0I am 19 year old female. I been experiencing dizziness to the point when I get up I black out for a few seconds, headaches off and on through out the day and when I wake up, excessive fatigue, and I noticed my vision has been blurry. I been having these symptoms for almost 3 weeks now. I haven't been to the doctor's due to not having insurance at this time. I'm not pregnant and I am on Depo-Provera shot since last November 2009. Can you tell me what could be giving me these symptoms? Please and Thank you!",
