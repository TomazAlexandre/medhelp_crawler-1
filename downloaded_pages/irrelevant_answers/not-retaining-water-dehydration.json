    "question": "For the past several months, I have noticed that when I drink water I frequently use the restroom as compared to drinking orange juice for example. Last night, I drank around 64 oz and every twenty minutes I was up to use the restroom. I couldn't sleep due to feelings of dehydration, but I drank an incredible amount of water! This morning I awoke yet again feeling dehydrated and with my heart beating a bit fast. I am 20 yrs old, eat healthily and exercise daily. What could be the problem?",
