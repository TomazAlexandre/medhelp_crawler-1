            "answer": "Balanitis is an inflammation of the glans penis (head of penis). Symptoms may include:\u00a0\u00a0Red swollen tender penis, Blotchy rash,\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally penile discharge, Itchy and uncomfortable skin, In severe cases, inability to retract foreskin.Balanitis is not a sexually transmitted disease. It is usually caused by irritants that are normally present on the skin. These can include bacteria and Candida yeast.RISK FACTORS:Poor personal hygieneUncircumcised menDiabetesChemical irritants including soapObesityAny of these may cause balantis, especially in the area under the foreskin, which tends to stay moist.\u00a0\u00a0If it is not cleaned for a couple of days, balantis may develop.There are several other conditions that may cause inflammation on the head of the penis, including:DermatitisPsoriasisReiter syndromeLichen sclerosusLichen planusPlasma cell balanitisPenile intraepithelial cancerTREATMENT:The main aim of treatment is to keep the head of the penis and foreskin clean and dry. This should prevent infection and thus complications. Daily showering with particular attention to cleaning this area is necessary. Slide the foreskin back towards your body so the head of the penis is exposed. Wash with warm water; do not use soap as this may irritate the area.After washing, dry the area thoroughly. Make sure the head of the penis is completely dry before replacing the foreskin.If proper cleaning does not work, your doctor may prescribe a topical antimicrobial cream to treat any infection. Antifungal cream is usually used in adult men with probable candidal balanitis. Topical antibacterial creams may be more effective in children. Oral antifungal drugs such as itraconazole and fluconazole may be helpful for persistent yeast infections. Topical steroids may be used if there is significant irritant reaction.COMPLICATIONS: The foreskin adheres to the inflamed and swollen glans penis and cannot be retracted (phimosis). Correction of this requires surgery and possibly circumcision.Michael",

    "question": "From the past 3 weeks or so, I've developed a slight sting everytime I urinate. I am 13 years old boy, uncircumcized, and the reason might be from poor hygiene I've had from childhood. Right now my parents tell me to wash my penis in salt water, which helps sooth it but I can still see swelling urethral opening and at other places on my penis head. Everyday now I rinse my penis with warm water, and sometimes take bathes. One day I noticed hard white flakes under my foreskin (smegma?) and I gently washed it off. It seems to be working, because I feel much better now. My question is, should I go see the doctor or will I heal up by regularily washing and caring for my health?Thanks",
