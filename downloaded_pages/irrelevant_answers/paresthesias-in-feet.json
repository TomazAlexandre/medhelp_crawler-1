    "question": "6 weeks ago I experienced bilateral muscle fatigue in my thighs, shortly after that I began having paresthesias in my feet, and occasionally a \"buzzing\" feeling in the left ankle. I had blood tests ruling out vitamin deficiencies , auto immune diseases and myopathies. A lumbar MRI showed mild degeneration and dessication with minimal bulge at L1 and L2. I am not sure what my next step should be as none of the doctors seemed too concerned. I am female, 53 years old and had late stage breast cancer 4 years ago, completed treatment and am now cancer free. Am I too old to have MS? Could this be some manifestation of cancer? What should my next step be. The symptoms are very annoying and quite concerning to me. The main area of tingling is under the second toe and between the great toe and second toe.",
