            "answer": "Hello BikingDiabetic,We are volunteers here and not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0I encourage\u00a0\u00a0you to have your children tested by their pediatrician since you are observing some symptoms that might suggest abnormal blood sugars.Depending on when a non-diabetic's blood sugar is tested, they may certainly see numbers in the 140s.\u00a0\u00a0However, as you know all too well, as difficult as diabetes is, the real damage comes from uncontrolled and/or undiagnosed diabetes.I can sure relate to wanting to ignore symptoms, and it could well be that your daughter get some 'special attention' for certain behaviors that she chooses to repeat (sibling rivalry can bring out all sorts of wonderful behaviors!), but the best thing to do for all of you is to have her tested.\u00a0\u00a0To the extent that she's simply seeking more mommy-time now that her brother is at a demanding age, the pediatrician might have suggestions, too.Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Your children are lucky to have such an attentive mom.",

            "answer": "I know being that your a type one diabetic you have thought about this but let me ask anyways.\u00a0\u00a0How long did you wait to take her blood sugar after she ate.\u00a0\u00a0Was it a fasting blood sugar if not What is her fasting blood sugar.The normal fasting blood glucose range for children in most labs is 60 to 100 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL). The normal range may vary slightly from lab to lab. Normal ranges are usually shown next to the results in the lab report. A fasting blood sugar level of 126 mg/dL or higher can mean your child has diabetes.Test results are only one part of a larger picture that takes into account your child's medical history and current health. Sometimes a test needs to be repeated to check the first result. Talk to your health care provider about the result you got and ask questions.Good Luck!",
