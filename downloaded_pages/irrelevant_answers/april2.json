            "answer": "Is this something that just started? It's possible that you're drinking more since it's jot out and maybe you don't even know it. You've been tested for a urinary tract infection, right? Have you been tested for diabetes? You pee a lot and are real thirsty if you're diabetic. I do think stress can play a factor. I think it makes a lot of things in your body hypersensitive. I've noticed more palpitations, stomachaches and going to the bathroom more the last few months. They did notice I have PVC's on the EKG, which are usually harmless, and I also had H.Pylori, which is a bacteria in the linning of the stomach, but both can be caused or come on due to stress. I have been under a tremendous amount of stress this last year, but what surprised me was I didn't have these symptoms until recently when things where actually getting better. I've been told it can take awhile for the body to react to constant stress like that. So it is possible that this is due to stress even though you think things are better now. Try some deep breathing exercises and gentle stretches each day. See if that helps. I hope you feel better soon! :)",
