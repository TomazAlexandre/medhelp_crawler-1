Every lab may have different levels of low and high for each test. These are marked/noted on your lab results printout. You should obtain copies of your lab(s) each time you take one so you have a hard copy for your own records.",

            "answer": "I have been an insulin dependant diabetic for 13 years now and my new endocrinologist decided to check my c-peptide and the results were:0.9 with the reference range being:\u00a0\u00a0 1.1 - 4.4So my poor little pancreas is just worn out. The way she explained it to me was that all the pills they have out there for type II are good if your pancreas is working but since mine is not insulin is my only choice. I had originally considered haveing gastric bypass with the hopes of losing a lot of weight and possibly having the diabetes maybe go away like you hear so many people that have had it done. She said since my pancreas is not really working anymore even if I lost the weight I would still need insulin just probably not as much. Hope this helped you some!Take care!",
