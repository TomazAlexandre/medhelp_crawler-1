    "question": "Dear Doctor,I recently went along to a Doctor with my older husband who is 60 years old. He has put on a lot of weight in the last 10 years of his life and has diabetes. The Doctor was checking his height and weight and doing a check up, when she said he has a buried penis. We are both quite confused (and slightly amused!). Does she mean this as an actual medical condition? Or does she mean that it was simply buried when she saw it? If it is an actual medical condition, what can we do about it? What are the options? We no longer have sexual intercourse, but would like to if we had the opportunity.",
