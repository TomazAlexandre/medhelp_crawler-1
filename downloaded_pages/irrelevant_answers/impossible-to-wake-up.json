            "answer": "If after adequate sleep you are not rested and able to wake up, it may be helpful for you to get a sleep study and see if there's something going while you sleep preventing you from being rested. Too many of those 3am bedtimes can cause you to need more sleep to catch up, but if they are a rarity, that shouldn't be it. Have you had a checkup for your thyroid and for diabetes or anything that might cause increased tiredness?",

            "answer": "Hello, Angie.KatEyes is correct as always.\u00a0\u00a0If you are getting good sleep but are still exhausted inthe morning, you may have a sleep disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your doctor about a sleep study.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't have a sleep disorder then short acting Adderall or Ritalin will wake you up with an hour or so.\u00a0\u00a0If you're fatigued all day long, then a longer acting form of Adderall and Ritalin would work.\u00a0\u00a0Then, you set your alarm for two hours before you have to get up.\u00a0\u00a0You take your meds and fall back sleep.\u00a0\u00a0two hours later, when you wake up again, the meds will be kicking in and you'll wake up much faster.I have sleep apnea and even though I faithfully use my BiPAP machine, I am still exhausted.\u00a0\u00a0So, I take my Vyvanse (another form of Adderall) at 4:00AM and wake up again at 6:30.\u00a0\u00a0I am much better in the mornings now.First though, it's best to see your MD for blood tests, sleep study, etc, to rule out the obvious befroe trying medication.Best of luck!Curt",

    "question": "Does anyone have a trick on waking up and STAYING up in the morning??\u00a0\u00a0Whether I go to bed at 9:00pm or 3:00am ... it is impossible for me to get up in the mornings!\u00a0\u00a0I got good solid sleep through the night but I unconsciously press my snooze button (on 2 separate alarms) for a good 1.5 hours.\u00a0\u00a0I sleep hard and have realistic dreams so I think I'm actually up!\u00a0\u00a0Any pills or potions anyone knows of?",
