            "answer": "Didn't your doctor comment on your low FT4 level and your TSH level being associated with hypo symptoms such as those you mentioned?With a suspicion of Hashi's, the tests to be run are for the thyroid antibodies, TPO ab and TG ab.\u00a0\u00a0I also strongly suggest that you get tested for FT3, as well.\u00a0\u00a0If the doctor resists then insist on it and don't take no for an answer.\u00a0\u00a0FT3 is the biologically active thyroid\u00a0\u00a0hormone that largely regulates metabolism and many other body functions.\u00a0\u00a0Scientific studies have also shown that FT3 correlated best with hypo symptoms, while FT4 and TSH did not correlate very well at all.Be aware that just because your appointment is with an Endo, does not mean that he will be a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many of them specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Many also have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\" and only want to diagnose by TSH.\u00a0\u00a0This doesn't work.\u00a0\u00a0 A good thyroid doctor will treat a patient clinically, by testing and adjusting FT3 and FT4 as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief should be all important, not thyroid test results.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to inquire about the doctor's willingness to treat you clinically in this manner so that you will know if you need to keep looking for a good thyroid doctor.",

    "question": "I just got the results of my follow up labs:SGPT 27 (30-65 NORM)TSH 3.5\u00a0\u00a0(0.3 -4.8 NORM REF)FREE T4 0.48 ( 0.5-1.5 NORM REF)HGB 10.6 (12-16 REF)Still taking Tapazole and Atenolol, but decreased dose from 7.5 to 5 mg (Tap) about a week or so ago because of excessive fatigue and weight gain despite exercising and diet.\u00a0\u00a0I will see endo for f/u in a week and a half.\u00a0\u00a0So, any thoughts on labs?\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if she will just keep weaning or what.\u00a0\u00a0Of course I am taking more iron supplements on top of multivitamins I was already taking. Still very tired, weak and sore muscles, short of breath easily and palpitations, but that could also be related to anemia.\u00a0\u00a0I know endo thinks I should have surgery to remove large goiter still.\u00a0\u00a0But surgery sounds very scary, but I feel this could go on forever.",
