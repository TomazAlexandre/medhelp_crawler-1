            "answer": "Hello,Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a type of bacteria that is found in the lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy adults and in the vagina and/or lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy, adult women. Normally, the presence of GBS does not cause problems.But sometimes like in pregnancy(which is a stressful state in itself),immunocompromised states,low immunity,hormone changes,under stress and even idiopathic(cause not known), GBS bacteria can invade the body and cause serious infectionRegarding painful intercourse, Usually pain during the initial stages of penetration is due to UTI and vaginal infection or vaginitis, a tight vaginal wall, sores at the mouth of vagina or vestibulitis, vulvodynia or a dry vagina (frictional injury), thrush or fungal infection. Pain on deep penetration is due to pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, irritable bowel syndrome, pelvic tumors, cervical and uterine infections and tumors. Depending on the site of pain during penetration, diagnosis can be made. This can be further confirmed by clinical examination, ultrasound abdomen or CT scan, PAP smear and a STD panel as required.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hey everyone. So I have streptococcus B in my vaginal track and I have been dealing with UTIs and yest infections for the past 7 months. It was only about 2 1/2 months ago that I found out that I had strep b as well. In the past 7 months I have been on 15 different medications. This includes various types of cremes and antibiotics. I have even been on penicillin twice. I am 19 and definitely not pregnant, I am on birth control. I don't have many symptoms and since I got rid of the UTIs and yest infections all the irritation as gone away. The only issue I have is painful sex. I have not been able to really have sex with my fiance in the past 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing I do seems to treat this infection. Diabetes runs very prevalently on both sides of my family and I know Strep b is often connected with another issue, including diabetes. I am worried that I am over reacting. I was hoping if any one could give me some advice or treatment options. I am tired of being sick, in pain, and constantly being on antibiotics. Any help will be greatly appreciated! :D",
