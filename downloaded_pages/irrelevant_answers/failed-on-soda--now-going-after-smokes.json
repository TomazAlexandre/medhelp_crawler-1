            "answer": "Sugary Drinks Add to Global Death RatesBy Chris Kaiser, Cardiology Editor, MedPage TodayPublished: March 20, 2013Action PointsThis study was published as an abstract and presented at a conference. These data and conclusions should be considered to be preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.That pick-me-up sugary soda may ultimately put you 6' under, given findings that linked nearly 200,000 deaths worldwide in 2010 with sugar-sweetened beverages.The 184,000 adult deaths worldwide associated with sugar-sweetened soda, sports drinks, and fruit drinks included 132,000 from diabetes, 45,000 from cardiovascular disease, and 4,600 from cancers, according to Gitanjali Singh, PhD, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health, and colleagues.The highest death rate that could be attributed to intake of sugar-sweetened beverages was in adults older than 65 in Latin America and the Caribbean, with 118 deaths per million population, the researchers reported at the American Heart Association (AHA) Epidemiology and Prevention/Nutrition, Physical Activity and Metabolism 2013 Scientific Sessions.In the U.S., the research indicated that about 25,000 deaths in 2010 were linked to drinking sugar-sweetened beverages.\"Sugar-sweetened beverages are consumed throughout the world, and contribute to excess body weight, which increases the risk of developing diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and some cancers,\" researchers wrote.The AHA recommends no more than 450 calories per week from sugar-sweetened beverages, based on a 2,000-calorie diet. The organization in 2010 had unveiled \"Life's Simple Seven,\" as part of its \"2020 Initiative.\" The goal of the initiative is to improve the cardiovascular health of all Americans by 20% while reducing death from cardiovascular diseases and stroke by 20%.The Simple Seven health behaviors or factors that are associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease and a decreased risk of cancer are smoking, physical activity, obesity, dietary intake, total cholesterol, blood pressure, and blood sugar.For the current study, Singh and colleagues focused on the burden of adiposity-related cardiovascular disease, cancers, and diabetes, which, they said, had \"not been systematically assessed\" in terms of the impact that sugar\u2010sweetened beverages have on them.The data were collected as part of the 2010 Global Burden of Diseases Study. Researchers talked with experts across the globe to obtain 114 national dietary surveys, covering more than 60% of the population.They used country\u2010, age\u2010, sex\u2010, and cause\u2010specific mortality data from the World Health Organization and employed various analytical tools to evaluate the data.Singh and colleagues found that 78% of the 184,000 deaths in 2010 associated with overconsuming sugary drinks were in low and middle-income countries, rather than high-income countries.Of the 15 most populous countries, Mexico ranked at the top for the largest absolute deaths (318 deaths per million adults) and proportional deaths (30% of adults younger than 45) due to sugar-sweetened beverages. The country also has one of the highest per-capita consumption of sugary beverages in the world, researchers said.Japan, one of the countries with lowest per-capita consumption of sugary beverages in the world, had the lowest death rate associated with the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, at about 10 deaths per million adults.In all age groups (20 to 44, 45 to 65, and over 65) and in both men and women, Central American countries had the highest mortality rate associated with sugary drinks. China and Japan had the lowest in all those categories.The range of consumption varied, from less than one serving per day in Chinese women older than 65 to more than five servings per day in Cuban men younger than 45.East/Central Eurasia had the largest number of cardiovascular deaths (11,000) in 2010 related to the consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages, while Latin America/Caribbean had the most diabetes deaths (38,000).\"Because we were focused on deaths due to chronic diseases, our study focused on adults. Future research should assess the amount of sugary beverage consumption in children across the world and how this affects their current and future health,\" researchers said.The study was funded by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.One co-author reported relationships with GlaxoSmithKline, Sigma Tau, Pronova, International Life Sciences Institute, Bunge, SPRIM, Pollock Institute, Nutrition Impact, Foodminds, McKinsey Health Systems Institute, and Unilever North America.http://www.medpagetoday.com/Cardiology/Diabetes/37988",

As nygirl said \"I'm telling you if the dude bans donuts or pizza he'll find out what a fight really is.\".\u00a0\u00a0I've never been a donut/sweets eater, but both those, pizza, sugary drinks and all those other \"goodies\" are now off my menu.\u00a0\u00a0No skin off my nose, but there is a principal involved.The smoking issue is a bit different - there aren't so many different types of smoking materials, and smoking has been banned in a lot of places already.\u00a0\u00a0That's really only going to bother the smokers.",
