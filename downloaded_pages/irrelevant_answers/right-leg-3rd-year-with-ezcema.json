            "answer": "Hi,Eczematous disease is a chronic inflammatory disease condition which may be recurrent and even persistent given the right triggers. The best way to prevent the flare ups is to avoid the triggers which of course is easier said than done. Several\u00a0\u00a0underlying factors influence the mechanism of an eczematous disease. Genetic, autoimmune and environmental factors come into play. Until this very moment ,there is no definite effective medical therapy for eczema. Corticosteroids may help control the eruptions but with\u00a0\u00a0a history of eczema ,there is a chance for recurrence in the future.As with your condition ,it is best to have your leg examined.Is there any notable varicosities or swelling of the leg?Any underlying conditions like diabetes and thyroid problems?",

            "answer": "Thank you for your insight. Unfortunately I kinda figured this was the case.I do not have any diabetes nor thyroid issue as of yet, nor in the immediate family bloodline, however I did develop asthma about 7 years ago. I did here there was a link possible between asthma and skin disorders such as eczema, but not sure if this is factual?Also it is interesing you mention varicosities, I sit down 8 hours a day at work and I have over the past couple of years had noticed a flare up with my vein in the same leg on the upper outer thigh. I was told by primary care physician that it was a fatty tissue ball on my vein ( can't recall technical term) and because my grandmother has very bad visible (large) veins that are bulging out of her legs I should be weary and excercise so it can avoid the same outcome as I am prime canadiate.Thank you in advance for all you have provided. :) ~Nichole",

            "answer": "I have had eczema for almost 10 years now.\u00a0\u00a0The worst of my triggers is \"wet work,\" which is things like washing dishes or keeping my hands (where I get eczema breakouts the most) immersed in water.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been to a dermo to get patch testing?\u00a0\u00a0They can see if you are allergic to things in soaps, shampoos, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a dermo at the Univ. of Penn and I got patch testing and a list of things I am allergic to as well as a list of products safe to use.\u00a0\u00a0For example, I am allergic to something in many shampoos.\u00a0\u00a0Head and Shoulders shampoo was on the safe list and I haven't had any eczema on my back since I started using it.\u00a0\u00a0Even though I do not have dandruff, it has helped my skin so much.",

    "question": "I have this patch on front of right leg shin bone that gets millions of red raised cluster bumps that are so itchy i could peel my skin off. Then if i itch it flairs worse. It has spread all little more beyond the perimeter each year. I saw a dermatologist and he called it a sever case of ezcema.I use Cordrain tape (steroid tape) past two years for it and it will go away only to flair up next year.How can I prevent a breakout and why only this leg (thankfully its not all over). Is there a more underlining cause that might be showing up for soemthing else as I know any type of disease or illness will show is skin and fringernail bed changes.",
