            "answer": "I'm not sure where you got the normal range for A1C as 4.3 to 6.1, but that is incorrect. Normal (non-diabetic) A1Cs are under 5.7. 5.7 to 6.4 is considered pre-diabetic and 6.5 and over is diabetic. Different doctors ask different goals for people with diabetes, An A1C of 7.0 is not bad, but it would be better to get it down closer to 6.0. It is not possible to make blanket statements about blood sugar control because all diabetics are different. Some Type 2's can control their diabetes for many years with weight loss, exercise and carb reduction. Some need oral meds fairly early on. Diet and exercise is the first thing to try and if your numbers are still too high your doctor will talk with you about oral meds.",

            "answer": "We might be using the terms \"normal\" differently. I'm referring to the exact definition of what is considered pre-diabetes or diabetes for initial diagnosis. and that is cut and dry numbers. But then there is what is the \"optimal range\" for people with type 1 or type 2 diabetes and there is not really any consensus on that. I like that range above, though some doctors would say the lower end often comes about from too many lows. Some doctors go as high as 7.0 (I believe that is what the ADA-always behind the times still stipulates.) I think that is way too high. It's confusing. For example, I'm a type 1 and my current A1C is 6.3. If someone were to take that number out of context it would look like I was only pre-diabetic!",

            "answer": "Yes, there are many differences. I was misdiagnosed as type 2 for a year and a half, so I've kind of walked in both shoes. But in terms of A1C the diagnostic criteria are the same, and for the goals we both have the same needs to keep our numbers at a level to avoid complications. We each have our own obstacles to doing that. Type 2's have insulin resistance to deal with, and often control their blood sugar just with diet and exercise. Type 1's on the other hand tend to have more erratic fluctuations in numbers and if they're on insulin more risks of serious lows. (Which is why some doctors are uncomfortable with lower A1Cs that may be accomplished by having too many lows.).I'm on a website with 15,000 diabetics of both types and the topic of differences and similarities comes up a LOT!",

I also spoke with my oncologist who checked and got back to me that those numbers were indeed what the normal range should be for A1C (4.3 to 6.1) and that I need to come down a point.",

I have no desire to argue or explain distinctions that may not interest you, but often these threads are read by other people who may not yet be diagnosed, and will be confused by, say a number of 6.0 being designated \"normal\" when their doctor has told them it means they have pre-diabetes.

It is called the eAG [Estimated Average Glucose], and what many feel should be the patients goal.The ADAG [A1C-Derived Average Glucose] formula that is used to calculate the eAG from your A1c result is:28.7 X A1c \u2013 46.7 = eAGAn example of this is an A1c of 6%. The calculation for this would be:28.7 X 6 \u2013 46.7 = 126 mg/dlfor an estimated average glucose of 126 mg/dl.What this means is that for every one percent that your A1c goes up, it is equivalent to your average glucose going up by about 29 mg/dl.",
