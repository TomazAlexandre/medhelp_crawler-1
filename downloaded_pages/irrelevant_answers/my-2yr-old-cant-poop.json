            "answer": "Just a thought, have you tried cutting down on her dairy?My son suffered terrible constipation for over a year, continual trips to the doctors\u00a0\u00a0who prescribed laxatives and did\u00a0\u00a0urine tests which showed nothing, he had the urine tests as he also had an amonia smell on his breath and they wanted to rule out diabetes.He would often not have a BM but only pass small watery motions, this was where the 'blockage ' stool was only letting the more fluid BM through, but every few days he would have a large hard stool that really hurt him, just as youve described, many times he would pass blood, the doctor said this was from a small tear and would heal itself but to increase fuilds/take the laxatives/stool softeners, none of which helped.Eventually I went through his foods and cut out ALL dairy, milk, youghurt, cheese, and anything with milk ingredients, for two weeks. After a week he was going freely, it had been such a long time I thought he'd never have a normal BM again,\u00a0\u00a0I cant believe I hadnt thought of doing it sooner.Now I restrict his dairy, when he sneaks an extra youghurt out of the fridge or grandparents give him cheese it happens again.Ive been told many bowel problems are due to food intolerances, and the problem with children is once they have a painful movement they tend to become afraid of passing another and so hold it. The longer its held the drier it becomes and more difficult to pass.Sugar solutions like lactulose can often help to soften and lubricate without affecting the balance of the bowel , this could help to ease the BM, give her more confidence and restore a 'normal' routine again.",

            "answer": "Is she getting enough fluids?\u00a0\u00a0Water is best, but I know a lot of times kids don't like plain water...heck, I'm not a huge fan myself.\u00a0\u00a0You can add just enough sugar free Kool Aid or juice to give it some flavor so she likes it better, or buy flavored waters.\u00a0\u00a0Soda, pure juice, milk, etc are NOT going to hydrate her (or anyone) adequately.",

            "answer": "It sounds like she has a simple fissure. It will keep hurting & bleeding once in a while until it's allowed to heal. Talk to your pediatrician about it and ask about putting her on a stool softener (Mirilax is OTC now and works well) You'll want her on it for 3-4 months so that she doesn't have hard BM's that long. It takes that long to let the fissure heal and the skin be strong enough not to break again. Then after that just keep an eye on her to be sure she isn't 'holding it', because the longer she does the harder the BM gets.Better to deal with this now when she's 2, don't let\u00a0\u00a0it go on a long time or she'll get to be afraid of pooping and believe me that's a nightmare you don't want to have happen.",
