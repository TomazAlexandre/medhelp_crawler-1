            "answer": "Hello,The burning sensation in the genital area can be due to fungal infection but the burning sensation in the whole body can be due to parasthesia skin. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition. Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not. In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",
