    "question": "A few years ago I had some floaters and my doctor was worried about it and sent me to an eye doctor and I had this test done were I had my face up in this \"box\" where they flashed little lights and I had to click when I saw one on left or right side. After the test they sent me to a retina specialist. During this time they did some tests and also took pictures of my retina and said I had a hole in my right retina and wanted to do some more tests. Unfortunately I didn't get to go back because of some other problems.Now I am still having the floaters. Mostly in my right eye. What is this caused from. I have been pretty healthy. The only thing I have really had is when I was pregnant I had diabetes pretty bad but it wasn't controlled because my doctor was a joke (though that's another story)Right now I don't have health insurance so I am stuck on what to do. Any one can help. Btw way I am 32 didn't know if that is needed",
