            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you have temperature fluctuations the first things to be ruled out are thyroid disorders, adrenal gland problems, anemia, diabetes, hypoglycemia, liver diseases, low Vit B12, and vasovagal attacks.Consult a doctor and discuss these possibilities. Low testosterone is another possibility. You will need tests to rule out all these causes.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
