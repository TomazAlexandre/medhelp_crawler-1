    "question": "Let me start by saying that I have recently had an episode where I had severe chest pain and shortness of breath.\u00a0\u00a0it took me to the emergency room, where they ran a series of tests on me.\u00a0\u00a0I did a stress test, where I was able to walk for 12 minutes without incident.\u00a0\u00a0I did a series of blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0All seemed normal.\u00a0\u00a0I did a contrast CT scan of my upper body which revealed an ascending aortic aneurymism about 4 cms in diameter.\u00a0\u00a0All my arties appeared fine.\u00a0\u00a0I was sent home with instructions to check with my GP on the aneurymism, and to work to relieve severe GERD (which was the culprit on the chest pain apparently).In the last two days I've noticed that my legs and arms seem to fall asleep much more than they ever used to.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed this when I work at my desk, and when I sleep at night.\u00a0\u00a0I have a tempurdedic bed when has always been good and distributing weight, and it doesn't seem to be helping now.\u00a0\u00a0Ill wake up and my whole leg, or leg and foot appear to be 'asleep.'Something is going on here.\u00a0\u00a0Why is this leg tingling just starting now, so rapidly?the only other piece of info I have is that two years ago I was told that the rheumatoid athritis antibody was present in a blood test.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a rheumatologist and was told that I didn't have the disease and not to worry about it.\u00a0\u00a0Amy curious if there is anything there.I'm five foot ten and weight 200 pounds.I read that diabetes can cause leg tingling, but my blood sugars are all normal.I have read about plaque formation in the legs, but (1) why would this show up so rapidly as it has here in the last few weeks and (b) the pain never occurs when I'm excersizing.\u00a0\u00a0I have no symptoms when I walk or work in the yard, etc.I can feel a pulse in both feet, even when they are \"tingling\"",
