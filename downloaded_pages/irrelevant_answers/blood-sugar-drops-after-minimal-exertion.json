Another 15 minutes it will be 5-10 points higher still (again, no food/juice).",

If you are checking your blood sugar every 15 minutes, that's a bit obsessive.\u00a0\u00a0Must cost you a fortune in testing strips.",

            "answer": "Hi there, thanks for your response. I started checking it because of what I was feeling. Hungry after only 10-15 minutes of exercise, shakiness no matter how much I had eaten to prepare for exercising. And sudden feelings of hunger and shakiness after just a few minutes of walking.I wanted to know if it was correlating to anything, and my testing of the blood sugar seems to mean that it isn't all in my head. It is at the point where I don't want to exercise because that feeling of shakiness really ***** (and tends to ruin my day for the next few hours). And I take dried fruit strips with me when I go for a walk. I have found that when I don't \"stave off\" the feeling it just gets worse.And it wasn't always like this for me. This is a recent development in the last 8 months or so.",

    "question": "Hello, I have not been diagnosed with diabetes. I have been testing my blood sugar at home the last couple of months. I noticed that commonly I would suddenly feel very hungry after 15 minutes of light-to-moderate exercise. This happens no matter how much I eat or when before-hand.An example of a particularly dramatic drop: blood sugar 137 before exercising. After 15 minutes light-to-moderate exercise, it was 85.One time I felt particularly shaky, and it was 65. I didn't test before, but I felt \"normal\".What's worse is that I am getting these drops from even minimal physical activity. As an example: blood sugar 110, after walking at a slow pace (strolling) for a mere 10 minutes, I start to feel a little shaky and my sugar is 78.It is becoming that I am afraid to exercise, and I am taking dried fruit strips with me whenever I go outside, as the feeling is very unsettling.Does anyone have an idea of what could cause this? I brought it up to my GI doctor, but because I presented so many numbers, he put me in the \"anxious over nothing\" category. I'm waiting for an appointment with my general practitioner but was hoping to get some info in the meantime.Also, not sure this is related, but the feeling was similar: my sugar was 108. I drank 8 ounces of fruit juice (mostly papaya), and felt almost immediately disoriented. My blood sugar had dropped to 89. What would cause blood sugar to drop almost immediately after drinking fruit juice? And I realized that this must happen often, because sometimes I sip fruit juice and have a similar feeling. (So no more fruit juice to me!)I hope someone can point me in the right direction as to why this may be happening! I appreciate any and all replies! Thank you.",
