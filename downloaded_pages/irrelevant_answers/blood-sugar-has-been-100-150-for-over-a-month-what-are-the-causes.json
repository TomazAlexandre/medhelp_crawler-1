            "answer": "Hi,if you are not on any medications, and there are no other changes in\u00a0\u00a0your life, diet, activity level, then the most likely cause of this is actually prediabetes.It would be important to keep monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0If this develops fairly quickly there is a possibility that this could be early adult onset type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you do find that your hba1c has increase significantly from 4.7 (excellent and\u00a0\u00a0totally normal result) in a short time, you may ask your dr to consider antibody tests.When you say a good diet, what do you mean?\u00a0\u00a0Low fat, high complex carbs?\u00a0\u00a0Or Low carb, high healthy fats. the second is the correct diet to address prediabetes (Paleo eating approach).",

    "question": "I have noticed for the past 1-1.5 months I have had blood sugars 100-150 (150 an hour after eating). Even in the morning it has been 105-110. I have diabetic parents, so I know a lot about diabetes, which is why this does not seem to fit.I normally have lower blood sugars. My a1c was taken last year and was 4.7.I don't feel unwell, but I wonder if there is any other reason aside from diabetes that this could be.I have a very good diet. Nutritionists would approve. I do work out, but I do have some weight to lose. I know all about complex carbs, carb count, protein with meals,and glycemic index and insulin resistance. All I ever see online is pre-diabetes and that's it. Being that this has been going on for a short time, I feel that it may be something else. I am going to the doctor in two weeks, but I'd like to research other possible causes while I wait.31 year old female",
