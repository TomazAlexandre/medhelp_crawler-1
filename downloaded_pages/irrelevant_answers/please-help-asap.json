            "answer": "Doctors aren't gods. I went through four endos before I found one who didn't just focus on diabetes. Find an endo who will listen. One who specializes in hormones and thyroid. I have Hashimoto's with antibodies over 200. My first two endos laughed at me when I asked if I had thyroid disease. They didn't run the antibody tests.Have you had your TGab and TPOab tests? Thyroid ultrasound?Also, what's the FT3 level?You could have a pituitary problem with low TSH and low range FT4, but I don't know the FT3.I feel for you. I had some terrible hyper spells last spring when my Hashi had swung to hyper mode. I lost 15 pounds in a few weeks. I'll take hypo over hyper any day.Take care...:) Tamra",
