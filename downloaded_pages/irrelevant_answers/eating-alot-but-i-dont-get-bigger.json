    "question": "So recently this thought has been going on in my mind and i stumbled across this website and i decided to see if there were any answers to my question.Im 17, skinny, 60kg, don't really exercise and im 1.85m tallI usually eat alot like about 4-6 meals a day and this has been going on for the past 3-4 years. Thinking about it, its pretty common if you eat alot you'll get bigger ( fatter) but for the last few years my body hasn't really changed much but my height has and i was thinking there might be a problem with me.So i was hoping to find some answers to this question, why is my body not expanding?I've heard from my friends that it could be because i have fast metabolism but everyone has that so yeah..",
