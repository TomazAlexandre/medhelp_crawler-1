            "answer": "Going to a neurologist would be wise- they may want to order a brain scan\u00a0\u00a0and possibly an EEG as well with your symptoms.Additionally, I am strongly suspecting you may be suffering from water toxicity given the amount of fluid you say you are taking in.\u00a0\u00a0Water toxicity can lead to an electrolyte imbalance in your body, cause seizures and be deadly.\u00a0\u00a0Too low of sodium caused by water intoxication might also explain the syncope (fainting).Please be sure and cut back your fluid intake tremendously- think 48 ounces per day up to a maximum when you have a virus or infection of 80 ounces per day.\u00a0\u00a0Talk with your nephrologist (I hope you do have a kidney doctor since you have only one kidney?) about your situation also.",

            "answer": "Why do you drink so much water? Are you incredibly thirsty? If you are that thirsty I would suspect diabetes. If your blood sugar is out of whack it could cause some of the symptoms you are talking about. Also, I would see if a doctor can rule out Thyroid problems or certain types of epilepsy. I wish you better health.",

I have looked at Di and its the closest so far that I've come across.And I now think that on the one occasion that I had a suspected seizure it was due to re occuring black out and low enoughblood pressure and Di all at the same time I also think I had picked up a bug I don't think my body could take anymore and i had the seizure.Appointments waiting for scan on Stomache and egg head cap to monitor brain waves I am back at docs in two wk",
