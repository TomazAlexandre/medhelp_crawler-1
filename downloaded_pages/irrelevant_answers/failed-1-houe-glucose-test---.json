            "answer": "A lot of people who don't pass the one hour screening pass the 3 hour screening. It wouldn't have made you fail if you ate breakfast that morning and chewed gum, you probably would have failed anyway so don't worry too much.",

    "question": "So on Tuesday I had my regular ob appoinment where they weighed me, took blood pressure, and listen to the heartbeat. Then I was told to do my glucose test. They never had told me I was doing it that day. So I had eaten breakfast and also chewed gum during the visit. They called me and told me he results were high, I needed to go for a 3 hour test. My question is by any chance do you ladies think I failed because I had chewed gum before drinking the juice? I'm.so nervous and scared I have diabetes more scared for my baby. Please advice",
