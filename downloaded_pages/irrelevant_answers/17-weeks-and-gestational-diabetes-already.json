    "question": "At my 16 weeks app Dr told me that I had +2 glucose on urine, that same morning she sent me to do the 1 hr glucose test, I failed my one hour with 156 and cut off being 140 ( but that morning I had sugary breakfast) idk if it would affect my results! Yesterday I went to do my 3 hr test and I'm so desperate to get my results back! What I hate about the clinic its that they took a whole week to call me and tell me that I had failed my 1 hr, what am I supposed to do or eat while I get my 3 hr results back??",
