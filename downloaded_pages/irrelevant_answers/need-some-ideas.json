    "question": "Hi all! Happy 4th of July!I have a MedicAlert bracelet and I made a beaded bracelet for it instead of the yukky steel one that it came with.\u00a0\u00a0I am making lots of different ones to go with different outfits.My optometrist asked me to make her grand daughter a bracelet, as she has diabetes and wears one too.Thing is, she is only 12 years old and I have no idea what 12 year old fashions are nowadays. My own daughter is now 21! I don't know any young girls. (only dumb teenage boys! LOL!)Has anyone got any ideas? I was thinking of making a couple for her to choose from and if she doesn't like one I will undo it and re-use the beads.Thanks!",
