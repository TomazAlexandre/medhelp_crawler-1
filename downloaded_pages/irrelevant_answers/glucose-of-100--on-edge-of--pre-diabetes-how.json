    "question": "I'm new here but post on the thyroid forum often.My FASTING glucose level has been in the mid to upper 90's for about five years and this time it was 100 in a (range of 65-99 mg/dl considered normal). Other than Hoshimoto's thyroiditis\u00a0\u00a0(hypo auto immune thyroid) I have been well my whole life.My cholesterol labs are good. I am not over weight, and I have not eaten junk food in five years. I am fairly lean with a body mass index of 12. But my blood glucose keeps climbing. Why???I see an endo for my thyroid in two weeks:- what do I need to ask about my elevating glucose ?-What is this glucose test I have heard about?-what can I do to avoid diabetes that the docs dont stress, they just say eat well and exercise? - I always do!Having Hoshimotos is bad enough, I want to do as much as possible to lower my glucose.Thanks",
