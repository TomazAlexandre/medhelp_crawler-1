    "question": "While this isn't really related directly to MS I thought I would pass it along to my friends here.Since my DX for diabetes and actually getting my meter a couple of weeks ago I have found that when I go out to eat ( which is quite often ) my blood glucose has been going up around 30-40mg after I eat. But last night when I checked 1.5 hours after eating it had only gone up by 9mg. This had me completely baffled as to what made the difference. I even checked my meter with its control solution and retested myself. But still only 9mg. ????I ate pretty much the same thing I had before:Grilled BBQ chicken breastBrown bread with butterBroccoli with mayo ( a California thing )Mashed potato with brown gravy and mushrooms.The only difference was that instead of sweet tea I had coffee with cream & sugar to drink.Now I could not believe that sweet tea could have that much more carbohydrates in it than the coffee that I drank. So I kept wondering about this all day. Talked to my friend Dave about it as he also has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Twas a puzzlement!Then I tries goggling coffee and diabetes and up popped a report on a study from Jan. 13, 2011.\u00a0\u00a0about just this. The researchers studied 40,000 women and found that if they drank 4 cups of coffee with\u00a0\u00a0caffeine per day they decreased their risk of type II diabetes by 56%. For some reason that I didn't quite understand the coffee helps your body use insulin correctly.I stopped drinking coffee about 10 or so years ago and have only had maybe 6 cups in all those years. In fact in the last 6 years when I have soda it is of the caffeine free type. And I usually have sweet tea when I go out to eat.So tomorrow I get to go out and buy some coffee and related items so that I can start drinking it again.\u00a0\u00a0Since it seemed to work so good with my dinner maybe if I drink more it will get my blood sugar under control.So the moral of the story is to drink that coffee ( high octane style) so that you don't end up where I am.Dennis",
