Baby was born healthy but had some complications due to mom having diabetes and high blood pressure that was not monitored nor picked up until delivery.And as for ultrasounds,\u00a0\u00a0you can go to ultrasound schools or ultrasounds that are offered in a mall. There's a place called meet your baby. I went there for my twins. Awesome!Good luck",
