            "answer": "Hi!I am listing all possibilities that should be looked into to investigate a case like yours. You need to consult a doctor to narrow down the possibilities after a detailed medical history and clinical examination.Usually tingling sensations are due to peripheral neuropathies or vascular pathologies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies like deep vein thrombosis have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. There are several causes for peripheral neuropathies including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism.Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Nerve conduction studies should be done along with blood tests for above mentioned disorders. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis is another possibility but less likely in your case.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
