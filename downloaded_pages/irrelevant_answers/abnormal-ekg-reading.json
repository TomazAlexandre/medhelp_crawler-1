            "answer": "Both my husband and I had EKG's done which showed \"a previous heart attack\" My EKG was done in the ER, my husband's at a Cardiologist's office.\u00a0\u00a0We both were told that the computerized EKG's now a days \"spit out false previous heart attacks\".\u00a0\u00a0Both of us still had to go through all kind of tests to rule out a previous heart attack.I would not worry.\u00a0\u00a0They would not have done surgery on him if they had the slightest concern about his pre-op EKG.\u00a0\u00a0That is why they do these pre-op EKG's so they wont lose the patient during surgery and then get slammed with a malpractice suit.",

            "answer": "I was scheduled for a hysterectomy, hopefully laprocopically; two days prior, doctor's nurse called to tell me that my doc had recieved my pre-op tests & my EKG was too \"bad\" for surgery; until I had cardiologist clearance, surgery was postponed.\u00a0\u00a0They made an appointment for me with a good cardio, sooner than I would have gotten in.\u00a0\u00a0What would have constituted such a bad EKG to cancel surgery?\u00a0\u00a0I have a congential valve prolapse & have fibrillations.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",

    "question": "My husband is a newly diagnosed Type II diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0He is currently taking Glucophage and Januvia and is very well controlled with diet.\u00a0\u00a0He had an umbilical hernia repair and as part of his preop an EKG was performed.\u00a0\u00a0One of the nurses prepping him for surgery asked if he had been referred to a cardiologist concerning his \"abnormal\" EKG reading.\u00a0\u00a0Neither of us had been told there was a problem with it.\u00a0\u00a0Anesthesia and the surgeon said it wasn't anything to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0The surgery was done and there weren't any problems.\u00a0\u00a0The EKG results were as follows:NSR with sinus arrhythmia, low voltage QRS, cannot rule out anterior infarct, abnormal ECG.He is following up with his internal medicine physician next week as part of his every 3 month checkups for his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We are planning to take a copy of the EKG with us and go from there.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, however, we are very concerned about the fact that he is more likely to have heart disease and related problems due to diabetes. He is 43.\u00a0\u00a0He has no family history.\u00a0\u00a0His fatherand mother are alive and well at 72. Grandparents died in a car accident and the other of old age.Are there any other tests that would be more reliable than an EKG which seems to be just a \"picture of the moment\"?",
