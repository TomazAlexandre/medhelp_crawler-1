            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to rule out other neurological causes like motor neuron disease which can be upper or lower motor neuron disease. Presence of babinski\u2019s reflex and neurogenic bladder raise the suspicion of spinal cord injury.Other cause that needs to be excluded is peripheral neuropathy which can occur due to nerve damage, diabetes or B12 deficiency.Please discuss these possibilities with your treating doctor. Take care!",
