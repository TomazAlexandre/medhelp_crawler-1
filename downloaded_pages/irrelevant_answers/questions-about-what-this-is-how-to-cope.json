            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.The presence of Babinski\u2019s response indicates upper motor neuron damage in the spinal cord in the thoracic and lumbar region. This is also positive in seizures.Babinski reflex is not present in somatoform disorder.For neuropathy it is important to rule out diabetes and B12 deficiency. B complex supplements will help you. Medications like gabapentin which you are already taking have shown a good response in neuropathy.I would suggest you to prepone your appointment with your neurologist if possible.Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much! I was trying to look that up and you can't find that anywhere. LOLI've been screened for diabetes and I get whopping supplements IV from my naturopath regularily as well as oral for the b's and magnesium - so I know those two are out.I've got heat intollerance and a ton of other things too...but the neuro is very dismissive. I think I just need to switch dr's.Your time is much appreciated. :)",

    "question": "Hi - 33 yr old female. Have had multiple issues in the past that have been 'written off' later to find that they are 'real' - for example my endometriosis. Currently have neuropathy over the entire left side which is starting to migrate lightly to the right side for the past month. Have had transient ataxia for 5 yrs - went into a neuro the first time but he was highly dismissive so I've just learned to live with it. After all, it's more of an irritation unless I fall - and it always eventually resolves on its own. The neuropathy started 8 months ago and has been worstening steadily since then. As well I have trigeminal neuralgia. Am on gabapentin, carbamazepine and imipramine. Have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia in 2005.I'm all for looking at all angles. In 2003 at the initial problem walking/balance/fatigue I was told by the neuro that it was conversion disorder. I requested a referal to a phsyc at that time but he refused saying he didn't think it would do any good. I then sought out 2 therapists and a phsyc - all who've helped me a lot, but didn't find anything to support the conversion diagnosis. I've been trying to just ignore the staggering etc as best as I can - but this spring along with the neuropathy I started to fall more frequently and badly - so I was referred again.He found a babinski response and clonus in my left leg. The evoked potentials came back in normal ranges. The MRI shows several white matter lesions, but they are too small to meet MS diagnostic criteria. Don't see the neuro till nov to discuss the MRI.I'm in the meantime investigating somatoform disorders again and going to approach therapy, cause I'm going to nail this thing from all sides. It's not much fun. And therapy never hurts anyways, eh?My main question is can a babinski or clonus be the result of a somatoform illness? I've not found it listed as such, but you never know. I'm not a dr. LOL And is there any other things you can suggest to try? I'm finding the neuropathy quite painful atm. It was better controlled up to this, but since the staggering came back four weeks ago, it's been misbehaving quite badly. I eat a modified diet, see a naturopath for supplements, exercise and stretch (though exercising with the wobblies is hard) do guided imagry, deep breathing etc. I think that things need to be approached on a multilevel format. There's no easy simple 'one fix'. I know the things I'm doing are really excellent for my pain control - they help a lot - but they're not quite doing the job enough.",
