            "answer": "Many drugs or alcohol can slightly raise AST and ALT. Although your levels are so close to normal it could mean nothing. Mild-to-moderate (3-10 fold) elevations occur in chronic hepatitis, active cirrhosis, chronic passive congestion, drug-induced injury, metastatic tumor, biliary disease and a number of other conditions. times normal.Look up side effects of the drugs you are taking. It probably says they can raise liver transaminase levels.\"Mild elevations of the AST level, less than two times the upper limit of normal, are common. In part, this is explained by how normal values are calculated; normal is defined as the mean of the distribution \u00b1 2 standard deviations (SDs). By this definition, 2.5% of normal persons have values above the normal range. Common causes of mild increases in AST and ALT levels include reduction effect (e.g., status) and fatty liver disease seen most often in those with obesity, diabetes, or elevated blood lipid levels. Fatty liver is also seen in those who drink alcohol.\"You should be treating your high cholesterol. It can lead to serious heart disease over time. I would talk to your doctor about treating your high cholesterol now before any more damage is done.Your AST and ALT are so close to normal or normal most of the time I wouldn't worry about it. Just continue to monitor them periodically. As I said it is likely that the drugs you are taking are cause your AST/ALT to be slightly elevated. You have been test for viruses as you should have so it is good to know that is not an issue for you.Hector",
