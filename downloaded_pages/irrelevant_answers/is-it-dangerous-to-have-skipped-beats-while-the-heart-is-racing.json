            "answer": "Thanks again! You've been very helpful with my questions so far.I've only had the one episode so far, but it rattled me quite a bit. I've since worked out the issue with the person I was talking with, but I am still a tad concerned about the the PVCs during times of rapid heart rate. I'll bring it up with the doctor when I have the chance.I had a glucose tolerance test this morning and was thrown for a loop when the results came back as \"abnormal\". The caller told me that my numbers during the test were low, then very high, then low again and that it was an indicator for diabetes! I was told to have an A1C test done soon, so I headed down to the doctor's office to get it done this afternoon.The doctor looked over the results and I was called back and told that he doesn't think I actually have diabetes and that I just have low blood sugar. I was given a few tips on how to manage it and that was it. I was definitely shook up after that and now I'm not sure what to think. Which test was right? Should I be worried? Did the first caller just jump the gun with the results? Should I get tested again?Life keeps throwing me curveballs and I don't have a bat...",

    "question": "A few minutes ago I had a heated discussion on the internet (dumb, I know) and a particularly inflammatory remark caused my heart rate to skyrocket. I tend to react poorly to confrontation (I get shaky, I get a hit of adrenaline and my heart pounds) and that comment really made me react badly. While my heart was racing (faster than most physical exertion), I started getting skipped beats and fluttering.I'm a naturally anxious person and I've always reacted a lot like this when under intense social pressure, but I've only started having trouble with these skipped beats and wierdness in my chest the last couple years. I'm 24yo, not overweight and don't smoke/drink/do drugs, but I live a sedentary lifestyle and have a relatively poor diet. Since my palpitations and skipped beats have been on the upswing lately (more frequent and caused by smaller triggers) and after a few really bad episodes, I developed some pretty severe anxiety and panic attacks.When I had my reaction a while ago, I was feeling alright (normal heart rate and no irregularities), but the post made my heart rate spike suddenly and it started skipping while it was racing. I've geen diagnosed with uncommon PVCs and some occasional sinus tachycardia and bradycardia. I have no known structural heart issues or heart disease (it's been a few years since my last echo, though). Is it dangerous for my heart to skip beats while it's racing so fast? Is it possible for my heart to go into fibrillation or stop with so much stress and electrical activity all going on at once?I want to know if the racing heart caused by excitement, stress, fear, confrontation or panic attacksis is dangerous in combination with skipped beats/PVCs. Even playing intense/exciting video games causes me to get shaky and my heart to race. Will electrical issues like skipped beats make these events dangerous?",
