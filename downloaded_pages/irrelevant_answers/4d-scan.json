            "answer": "The weight you've gained really has nothing to do with gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It has to do with your baby - and the inability to process and control their sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It just happens sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0People that are 400 pounds could get it and people that are 120 pounds could get it.\u00a0\u00a0In reality it's not really what you eat that determines if you've got it.\u00a0\u00a0I eat very well with hardly any sugar and was borderline.\u00a0\u00a0It just has to do with the placenta and how it processes glucose.That's not to say that you have it.\u00a0\u00a0You could very well just have a big baby, the sonographer could have made a mistake or they could be off on your due date.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of factors to look at.I hope your glucose test goes well - GD ***** (even when you're just borderline!)",
