But I must write a note of warning... we cannot allow people to post individual e-mail addresses or mailing addresses on this website. If personal information like this appears in a comment, those of us who monitor the site have to remove the comment. Aligori, if you would like to try to get hold of an old pump, I would suggest contacting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation at www.jdrf.org and click on the link for the Online Diabetes Support Team. When you come to a window where you can describe your 'question', tell them that you want to be put in contact with the chapter in St. Louis, Missouri (and do describe your project). My bet is that someone who is involved with the local JDRF chapter may be able to help you. You could also try calling the offices of local endocrinologists... you may have to make up some cards with your contact info on them and leave them in the endocrinologists' offices if you go that route. Best of luck to you with your project.",

    "question": "Hello,I am an artist living in St. Louis, Missouri. I have several friends who are Type I diabetics. I have recently created a piece of artwork, trying to raise awareness about diabetes. I would like to create a 2nd piece for this small series, but need a pump to make it work. the pump doesnt need to work, i just need the shape or case of the pump. If anyone out there is not using one and wouldnt mind donating or selling it to me, please feel free to contact me. thanks,aligori",
