Had glucose tests when pregnant twice (last time 3 years ago) and no diabetes.I did not have a headache associated with the aura, and don't have chronic headaches.The tingling really began just a day after my fall.

    "question": "I have this mixed bag of symptoms that I'm starting to become worried about. I noticed some numbing in my fingers, like wearing a glove, a few days ago. A day after that I fell down our wood stairs, landing on my butt. Nothing terrible, just a big bruise. The day after that I noticed tingling in my fingers, then eventually both hands, feet, legs, and just different sections of my body. This is the second day that I'm experiencing tingling/pins/needles at different parts of my body. Sometimes I feel cool areas in spots. When I sleep, certain positions cause parts of my hands to be numb. To add to this, I've been dealing with a sore sternum for months. Pressure hurts on the upper part of it. About a month ago, I experienced this wierd ziz zag pattern in my right eye that went away in about 20 minutes. Lastly, I occasionaly get random soreness in my arm pits. This has been for a couple of years. Please advise. Thanks.",
