            "answer": "I too have gestational diabetes but was unfortunate in the fact that diet and exercise alone would not reduce my blood glucose levels enough for me to be safe; I have to take tablets, a limited Sugar and carb diet, inject insulin 4 times a day and also maintain a healthy level of exercise. Its really hard going. The one thing that is keeping me motivated is the fact that my little one has no say in his weight gain, so he could get too big for a natural and safe vaginal delivery. I was told that they gain too much weight around their abdomen if our glucose levels aren't controlled,\u00a0\u00a0so when it comes to delivery,\u00a0\u00a0they can get stuck. It has apparently been known for bones to be broken and dislocated to get them out. Keep at it. I know it is such hard work,\u00a0\u00a0but you only have a few more weeks to go and to get this far and only be asking for motivation now is a credit to all the hard work you're already putting in.",
