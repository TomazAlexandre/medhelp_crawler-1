            "answer": "Please keep in mind that we are not doctors so you should discuss these issues with your father's cardiologist or get a second medical opinion if you are concerned.Having said that, your father's report is pretty normal for a 74 year old man TVD. His EF% is good and the findings of mild LVH which means the walls of his ventricle are a little think which could be due to the valve disease, but it is not serious. The hypokinesis is a lazy area of the heart that does not beat as strong as it should, but he is on good meds for that.Overall, his report is not bad given his history. I would just be working very closely with his doctor.As long as he keeps his cholesterol and BP under control he should do well.Good luck!Jon",
