            "answer": "You have constipation and probably hemorrhoids or anal fissures caused from constipation and straining,Have you tried Metamucil daily in water?\u00a0\u00a0If that is not strong enough, then at least start with Miralax (or a generic form of that).\u00a0\u00a0That could get you cleaned out and then maybe you could go back to Metamucil, or maybe you could take Miralax once a day and Metamucil the other time each day.\u00a0\u00a0What's great about Metamucil is that at the same time it can help increase fiber, it can lower your cholesterol.I think you might want to get tested for Celiac disease.\u00a0\u00a0You may have a gluten allergy.\u00a0\u00a0Also try to cut way back on dairy products, particularly milk, cheese, sour cream, ice cream, and yogurt.Eat more vegetables and lean chicken and fish.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to read up on eating an alkaline diet.\u00a0\u00a0The American diet has become much too acidic and high in grains.",

    "question": "I am a 53 years old female and am obese. I have had irritateing outer anal burning after a diarrea bowel movment for a year or so now. It only occures when I have diarrea, which is often. I take an imodium easy chew tablet and it works and I do not have diarrea or burning for 2 or3 days and then it wares off and starts all over agin. I never have a stomach ache when I have the diarrea but I still have a strong urge to strain alot sometimes, almost like being in labor! Sometimes I also have anal bleeding, sometimes alot. I useVagisil cream and Desitin ontment for the after bowel movement burning pain that comes and goes sometimes lasting for hours I also take medication for Type 2 Diabetes,Glucophage 2000 milligrams a day and 2 milligram amaryl tabs a day. Could that also be causeing this problem?. Please tell me what you think. Thankyou.",
