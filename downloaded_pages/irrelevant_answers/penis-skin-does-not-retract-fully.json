            "answer": "Just a bit of a warning... If you have this looked at by a Dr.\u00a0\u00a0No matter what the problem may be, try to find one who's foreskin friendly ;)No to answer you question about phimosis.The natural normal phimosis that all baby boys are born with- and grow out of- usually by age 3-5 (but can resolve on it's own during puberty with the hormones of puberty in some cases) is not a problem- it's a natural protective design of the body that protects the glans during infancy, protects the meatus (pee hole) from abrasion in the diaper, and functions as a part of the immature protection system of the child's sex organ.The tip of the foreskin has a ring of muscles, called the preputial sphincter- very fine muscles (like the muscles in scrotum skin that can make it tight or loose) these muscles can be damaged if they are forced to stretch when they are not ready and don't have the hormonal support to retain their strength and elasticity. Many people believed (and many still do) that baby boys need to have their foreskin pulled back as soon as they are born so they can clean out under the foreskin... (would you wipe out inside a baby girl's vagina to clean it? Would you tear open the eyes of a newborn kitten to wash their eyeball?) ...no- but for decades Doctors told parents they should do this to boys... and many parents did their duty and unfortunately- harmed their baby boys in the process.Forced retraction in childhood is probably the #1 reason why some men got the OTHER form of phimosis... which is an abnormal tightening of the tip of the foreskin which is caused by restrictive scarring. Other things can cause it too- repeated infections can cause similar scarring too (although it's my opinion that the infections and the improper care usually go hand in hand) A very rare cause of phimosis - BXO- which is a rare skin disorder and not related to the foreskin at all- except that it sometimes is located there. As men age, sometimes health or circulatory issues might set them up for foreskin problems - like diabetes. In that case I usually consider that the problem is the disease, and not the anatomy- when diabetics get infected toes- it's not because toes are a bad design- it's because diabetes is a really rough disease.Phimosis is a HIGHLY treatable problem. It's estimated that about 95% of cases of the problem kind of phimosis can be resolved without any surgery- just by using ointment, stretching exercises, modification of habits and perhaps a procedure called \"balloon dilation\"... the other 5% can almost always be helped with conservative surgery- that does not remove the foreskin- it just releases the tightness of the foreskin tip. There are several different \"trick cuts\" (they type that plastic surgeons use) that rearrange the skin that is there without removing anything.HTH!",

    "question": "I am a 25 years old and it seems that my foreskin on my penis does not retract fully when erect. When flacid I try to pull as much as I can , however I fear if I pull to much it may hurt. When masturbating, I just hold the whole penis skin and all. When receiving oral I guide my partner and make it a point to them\u00a0\u00a0not to try to pull down the foreskin ...but to be gentle. Same as when entering a vagina I hold it and slick it in. Is this normal, should the skin be pulled back? Is this a case of phimosis? I fear the idea to ever become circuncised. Please Help with any info!",
