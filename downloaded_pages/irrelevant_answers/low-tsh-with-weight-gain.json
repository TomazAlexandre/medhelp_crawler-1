            "answer": "My TSH levels came down to around 4 and I was on 100mcg, and I was losing weight and had an healthy appetite with no binge eating. I wanted the number to be lower thinking I would lose weight more rapidly, so I alternated taking 100mcg followed by 106mcg for two days. My TSH came down to around 2.5. However my weight loss ceased and I found I was gaining weight.I do my labs every 4 weeks, so I was able to get back to taking 100mcg, and I find the weight gain has stopped. I believe I will go back to losing weight.",

            "answer": "Hi there... This is a very old thread and a lot of water has flowed under the bridge for me...I've been diagnosed with pre-diabetes and metabolic syndrome, as well as a couple of other conditions.I was diagnosed with moderate peripheral neuropathy, due to long standing untreated Pernicious Anemia (autoimmune B12 deficiency) and have been on a couple of medications for that - one of which caused even more weight gain...I ended up at a high weight of 158 lbs and was eventually taken off that med and put on another that's \"supposed\" to help with weight loss, but only at a therapeutic level, which I wasn't given...I've been on various thyroid meds and dosages and still have a hard time losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0I'm currently on 100 mcg Levoxyl and 10 mcg generic T3/day...For the past 8 yrs, my TSH has stayed at < 0.01 to 0.01 and is totally irrelevant when determining what dosage of med one needs.Do you know what your Free T3 and Free T4 levels are?\u00a0\u00a0At the time I posted this thread in 2008, my doctor wasn't testing my Free T3 and Free T4, but I changed doctors and we began adjusting medication(s) based on those rather than TSH.\u00a0\u00a0That's when my hypo symptoms began going away and I began the long road back to health.\u00a0\u00a0The only symptoms I've had remaining are some tiredness and the weight issue, both of which could be attributed to other things, such as the metabolic syndrome and/or pre-diabetes or other vitamin/mineral deficiencies.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism in June 2008.\u00a0\u00a0During the year prior to the diagnosis, I went from a weight of 115-118 lbs to 140-145 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0During that time, I was also diagnosed with vitamin B12 deficiency and started on shots.\u00a0\u00a0My initial TSH result was 55.54 in June 2008 and I was put on 100 mcg synthroid daily.\u00a0\u00a0In mid Sep 2008, my TSH was again tested and result was 0.03 and my synthroid was dropped to 88 mcg daily.\u00a0\u00a0For well over a year, I have been on a diet (approx 1000-1200 calories/day) focusing on vegetables, fruits and whole grains.\u00a0\u00a0I work out for at least 30 minutes/day, as well as having a job which requires a large amount of exercise (mostly walking).\u00a0\u00a0In spite of my diet and exercise, my weight had stayed right around 145, but recently has begun to creep up again - it's now 149.\u00a0\u00a0I have talked to my doctor, but have not been given any ideas as to what might still be the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Is there something else that we should be looking for that could be causing this?\u00a0\u00a0Can you give some ideas of things that might help me lose the excess weight.\u00a0\u00a0Since I've never carried this much weight before, it's beginning to affect my feet and knees.Thank you",
