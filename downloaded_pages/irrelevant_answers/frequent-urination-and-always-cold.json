    "question": "I am concerned lately that I am cold all the time. That is very unusual for me, truthfully the exact opposite. I realize that I am now thirsty alot more often and have even lost control of my bladder in the middle of the night while asleep. I feel that I have been eating much less but haven't lost any weight. I am a bit confused about these symptoms so am wondering if anyone has any ideas or suggestions....thanks!",
