            "answer": "I would suggest that you make an appointment to see your doctor and ask if you can have a glucose intolerance test and do a HBA1C blood test.\u00a0\u00a0a HBA1C blood test will show the average glucose levels in the blood stream over a period of approximately 3 months.It may be that you have an insulin intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0This means that your pancreas is producing insulin, but this is not being used adequately by your body.Tiredness after eating food can be due to your sugar levels getting too high and this will cause tiredness.You may be better eating small quantities more often rather than have a large meal all in one go.It is also a good idea to get checked out.",

            "answer": "This sounds like an insulin utilization syndrome. In this case an HBA1C probably won't provide the answer, although it is a good idea to get one. You require an old-fashioned glucose test, or, alternatively\u00a0\u00a0what is called the insulin-clamp procedure. High glucose levels after eating produce sleepiness.",

    "question": "hellookay well every time i eat i always get really tired and end up sleeping afterwards. Even if i don't eat a whole lot i still end up getting tired and falling asleep about 5 minutes after i ate. I know for a fact that i don't have diabetes but it does run in my family along with high blood pressure and heart disease. But this has been happening recently at first i thought it was nothing but now this is happening every time i eat. i am only 105 pounds and 5 foot 2 inches so maybe it has something to do with my weight. i have no clue so if some one can help out with this that would be greatly appreciated.",
