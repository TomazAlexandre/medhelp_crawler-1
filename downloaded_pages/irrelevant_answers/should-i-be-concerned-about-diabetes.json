            "answer": "Hello,Your tests are still within normal right now even though the values are higher than your sister's. WaveRider above is correct: post-meal glucose values of less than 140mg/dL are thought to be ideal and this is the goal we use for tight gucose control in diabetic, but under 180mg/dL is acceptable as well and still out of diabetes range.Given your Mother's diagnosis it is always best to try to optimize your own health anyway. Try cutting back on the sweets, making healthier choices with your food overall and being on a regular exercise routine. Lifestyle changes such as those have shown to be the most successful, even more than medication, in preventing diabetes, so give it your best shot and you are on your way to staying healthy.Take care.",

            "answer": "Several of the most current Published Clinical Research shows a direct link to the First Stage of Digestion and Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Over 68% of Patients with Type II Diabetes, have Hypochlorhydria, or Achlorhydria..\u00a0\u00a0As you know, the excess of processed Sugar, Caffeine, Cabohydrates, Sodas, etc., stimulate he body organs and tissue.\u00a0\u00a0When the organs and tissue are stimulated the cell start to release blood sugar, which is what people find when they do their testing.The consumptionn of these products inhibits the release of Glycogen from the Liver, and prevents the body from buring fats.\u00a0\u00a0This is a very simple explination, it is actually much more complex.\u00a0\u00a0A balance alkaline diet is essential in the care and prevention of Diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0Unfortuantely, a balanced diet will not meet all the bodies needs if the First Stage of Digestion is out of balance.\u00a0\u00a0The Gut is responsible for Sterilization, and conversion of the Nutrients consumed.\u00a0\u00a0There is very little absorption in the Gut except for certain fluids and alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0Pepsin is one of the Chief Enzymes of the Gastric Juices. It is responsible for the Converion of Proteins into Proteoses, and Peptones.\u00a0\u00a0Pepsin is most active in the Digestive Process when the Gut pH is 1.0 to 1.3 pH.\u00a0\u00a0When the Gut pH is at 5.0 pH, these enzymes are virtually inactive, resulting in reduced conversion, and subquently deminished absorption.\u00a0\u00a0To complicate this problem The Hydrochloric Acid Produced by the Parietal Cells, canmot properly sterlize the nutrients. Virtually all Protein contains Allergens that are normally destroyed in the Gut. If you are not producing sufficient Hydrochloric acid, these allergens are dumped into the Small bowel, and in many cases will cause Allergies and other Disorders. The immune System normally attacks bacteria, paracites, and others.\u00a0\u00a0It is not suppose to attack the sterilized and converted nutreints we consume, which is exactly what is happening, causing antibodies, or immunoglobulin to create an inflamatory responce.\u00a0\u00a0The responce stimulates the organs and tissue, which cause the cells to release Glucose.\u00a0\u00a0As I mentioned earlier the First Stage of Digestion must work at its optimul level to support the Immune System.\u00a0\u00a0When the Gut pH is out of balance the Immune system is not getting the full support it requires,\u00a0\u00a0The Clinical Studies show that Type II Diabetics have abnormal Glucose tollerance curves, correcting in unbalanced condition made a marked inprovement in the tollerance curves, and in some cases allowed the reduction of Insulin intake.\u00a0\u00a0I would highly recommed that you get a pH Diagnostic test to determine what medication you need to balance the first stage of Digestion.\u00a0\u00a0I am not referring to a naso-gastric test, which can be very traumatic and the test results are limited in determining the conversion factor of your system.\u00a0\u00a0There is a pH Diagnostic test that uses a tiny micro-electronic pH Capsule.\u00a0\u00a0The Capsule is swallowed with a sip of water, it immediately transmitts the informtion to a computer.\u00a0\u00a0The test will tell you if you have Hypochlorhydria (hidden or Obvous), Hyperchlorhydria, Achlorhydria, Heavy Stomach Mucus, Pyloric insufficincy, and much more. The test is called the Heidelberg pH Diagnostic test.\u00a0\u00a0It takes about 30 minutes, and it is done in a Doctors office.\u00a0\u00a0If you want more information I suggest you visit www.phcapsule.com",

            "answer": "Boy, don't you hate it when someone responds by copy/paste a bunch of jibber jabber they found on a web site?Your levels look good and \"if i eat healthy my levels are normal.\" then continue to do so. Are you concerned about your sister? Doctor Ramsetty may come along and correct me but I'm under the impression that <180 mg/dl (less than) 2-4 hours after a meal is tolerable where <140 mg/dl is ideal.\"her levels are never higher than 115.\"If fasting then she falls into a being a prediabetic and should be careful of her sugars and bad carbs intake.

    "question": "I am a 30 yr old female relatively health.\u00a0\u00a0My mother was diagnosed with diabets aprox 2mnths ago, so I have been testing my levels as well.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting levels\u00a0\u00a0are always below 100, however I have noticed that if I eat candy, or a meal with a lot of fats and carbs and test my levels two hour later they can range between 125-170. However, if i eat healthy my levels are normal. This concerns me because my sister can eat tons of sugar and her levels are never higher than 115.,\u00a0\u00a0I read somewhere that regardless of the amount of sugar you eat if you are truley not diabetic your levels should not be higher than 115.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice is would be helpful, thank you for your time.",
