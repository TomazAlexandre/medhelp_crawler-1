            "answer": "HI,People with diabetes can have dysfunction of the GI system that causes irregular movements of the gut etc, and can certanly cause vomiting. Also, the stomach often does not empty quite well, and that leads to this problems also. However other problems , some related to diabetes(like yeast infections in the throat) and others not, can be the reason. I think your father should be seen by a gastroenterologist and likely have an upper endoscopy as well as gastric emptying study to see what is going on. It may be quite simple but also could be more serious, so it should be done soon.Best of luck, take care.",

    "question": "Any help you can provide would be much appreciated. My father has type II diabetes and has started vomiting while eating over the last several months. It appears as though he's able to swallow, but will then uncontrollably vomit. This happens probably once every other day, and he's now too nervous to eat out as a result, etc. I don't think it's a stomach thing, as there is no upset stomach or reflux that appears to be invoved....I think it's rather esophageal in nature.Besides the diabetes and (treated) high blood pressure, he is otherwise healthy and 65 years of age. He uses insulin by injection daily and maintains acceptable blood sugar levels.Have you heard of this being a complication of diabetes or experienced similar? Do you have suggestions for treatment? He has discussed this with his doctor but out of embarassment minimized its frequency of occurence and the effect it's having on his quality of life.I appreciate any ideas you may have.Thanks!Elizabeth",
