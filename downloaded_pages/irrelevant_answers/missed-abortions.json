    "question": "Hi,I had 3 miscarriages, actually missed abortions, where the embrio just stop developing and all have been removed by surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The first one was in 6th week, the second in 8th week and the third in 5th week.\u00a0\u00a0After the second missed abortion I test my blood and appeared that I had increased Anti Phospholipid Antibodies, for whom the only medicine I was told is daily dose of Aspirin, 100mg. I have been taking the Aspirin and still had the third miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0After the third, I had Hysteroscopy and no septum or any other uterus malformalities were discovered.\u00a0\u00a0It has been 6 months from the last pregnancy and I would like to get pregnant again (which is not a problem at all) and I am scared to try and loose it.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that the doctors can not discover what is wrong. Can you suggest any tests or check ups that I should do before I get pregnant for the forth time? All the tests on the removed embryos show poor vascularisation, like my uterus can not accept the fertilized egg.Thank you,Ana",
