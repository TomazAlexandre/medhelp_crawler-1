            "answer": "Nausea is mostly caused by the dizziness, so why is the body dizzy?\u00a0\u00a0Dizzy can mean different things to different people.\u00a0\u00a0If he is \"lightheaded\" it can be caused from anemia, excess sweating, low level dehydration, blood pressure meds, low blood pressure, or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This is usually accompanied with visual darkening and the feeling of impending fainting.\u00a0\u00a0Adolescents in growth spurts often get this formof dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetics can get dizzy when it affects the peripheral nerves, with it being worse in the morning, or after a period of sitting or laying around.\u00a0\u00a0Subclavian Steal Syndrome can cause dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0The blood coming out of the heart travels the subcalvian arteries into the brain. When there is a blockage, the blood goes into the arm instead causing dizziness and peripheral nerve function impairment, so he would have problems with heaviness or touch in the arms and hands.\u00a0\u00a0Orthostatic Hypotension is problems with blood pressure when going from a sitting or laying position to a standin position.\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety is another problem that will cause dizziness and is usually accompanied by the sensation of being \"weak in the knees\".\u00a0\u00a0If the problem is with the inner ear, he will have ringing in the ear.\u00a0\u00a0Hypo- or hyperventilation also cause dizziness, especially if he plays computer games.\u00a0\u00a0Kids get excited and won't breath deeply,will hold their breath or will slightly hyperventilate causing dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Boys can enter puberty as early as age 9.\u00a0\u00a0So, I have to ask: has this been happening for a while? Or is this a new illness?\u00a0\u00a0It could very well be hormone related-- know that, depending on where they're working from, doctors are working with two different reference ranges for TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone): 0.3-3.0 or 0.5-5.0.\u00a0\u00a0So, maybe ask what the reading was.\u00a0\u00a0My brother developed hypothyroidism at a young age and it wasn't discovered until we looked at the reading (4.55).\u00a0\u00a0Since it wasn't over 5.0, it was deemed \"normal\", although it should be around 2.However, the fact that he's getting sick after he eats makes me think: diabetes.And since you've tested him for Celiac disease, I guess they've ruled out malabsorption and vitamin deficiencies....??",

    "question": "My 9 year old has had adominable pain, coupled with dizziness (in his head, not the room spinning) for over a year now.\u00a0\u00a0He gets hot and cold as well, we were first told it is allergies, but nothing shown on the skin test they conducted.\u00a0\u00a0We then saw a GI doctor who said he thought our son was lactose intolerant, he has had an MRI of his head, CAT scan on his abdomin, blood work, and a hearing test. ( I had been diagnosed with Menieres years ago)\u00a0\u00a0The ENT said there was no indication of Menieres, and the GI doctor said my son just has constipation and a little Gastro-reflux.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know how he could get so dizzy from this?\u00a0\u00a0We even thought it might be wheat allergies, but an endoscopy did not show evidence of Celiac disease.\u00a0\u00a0Someone said my son could be making this up, but he spends much of his time in bed, looking out the window, wanting to play with his friends, but he is too dizzy, and sick to his stomach (no vomiting yet).\u00a0\u00a0He gave up candy too, thinking maybe that made his sick.\u00a0\u00a0I really am worried about him.\u00a0\u00a0They said he has no allergies, but he has the tell tale signs, (bags under the eyes) my Pediatrician said she knows he is not making it up, and she is determined to find out what is wrong. Should we go to an Internist, or another Doctor?\u00a0\u00a0My email address is ***@****\u00a0\u00a0if anyone has any help we really welcome it.",
