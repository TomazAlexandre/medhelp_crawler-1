    "question": "My husband was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabeties. Just recently he's been having this pain in both of his eyes where it makes it so he won't open them anymore. This pain comes with a headache that he says is like a throbbing sensation in the top and front of his head right above his eyes.Now for some reason this only happens like one to two hours before he gets ready to go to sleep, on occasion it will happen during the day but not usually. His blood sugar has been high lately and getting it to go down is much harder than it was when he was first diagnosed. How do i get the ache to go away or has anyone had this problem and knows what it might be so i can mention it to the doctor because even he doesn't seem to know?",
