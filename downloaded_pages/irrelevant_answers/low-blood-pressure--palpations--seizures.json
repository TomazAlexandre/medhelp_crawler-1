            "answer": "Skynoell,Thanks for your post.Low blood pressure can lead to seizures in special circumstances.\u00a0\u00a0I have seen 2 or 3 patients who feinted from dehydration, but did not go to ground because they were seatbelted in their car.\u00a0\u00a0They were noted to feint, and then develop seizures 30 to 60 seconds later because they became very hypotensive and/or hypoxic.I have never seen someone who developed seizures from low blood pressure, but who were otherwise able to function.\u00a0\u00a0Further, low blood pressure will not lead to left temporal lobe spikes.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a neurologist, but my recollection from residency is that these indicate a common type of epilepsy.Good luck.",
