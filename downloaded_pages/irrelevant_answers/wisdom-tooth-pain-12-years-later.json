            "answer": "HI,The gap after tooth extraction will usually fill up and heal by secondary intention within a few weeks time. If it has not healed for 12 years then there must be something that is preventing healing to occur. This can be infection and abscess formation. The gross taste may be an indication. Also anaemia, diabetes or other conditions that decrease a person\u2019s immunity may prevent healing. You should take a second opinion regarding the matter from another Doctor. Hope this helps.The answer is based on information provided. Exact advice is not possible without a proper examination and investigations. You are requested to consult your Doctor. Take care and keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Same issue here. I had my wisdom teeth extracted in 1997! I guess not a wise choice after all. Where the wisdom teeth were extracted, the gums tends to swell and cause pain from time to time and, yes,\u00a0\u00a0the unfortunate smell. I had the area x-rayed/Panexed(?) as well as examined by several different orthodontists and\u00a0\u00a0periodontists, but to no avail. There never seems to be an issue. . . . yet there is. Gargling with warm sea salt water\u00a0\u00a0followed by a clove oil soaked cotton ball tend to to alleviate the pain enough to get some sleep. I agree, there has to be a root cause, keep checking back with your DDS until you find one. Good luck. Hope your dental group is better than mine.",

    "question": "I had my two top wisdom teeth pulled over 12 years ago and I still have a gaping hole where one of teeth used to be, I have been back to the dentist numerous times over the years because I think it gets infected. It starts to hurt really bad, then there is a blister type thing that fills the hole and eventually it goes down, but then my jaw will hurt for a week or so and I won't be able to open my mouth all the way no matter what I do. The dentist keeps telling me that it is fine and I have to keep it clean (which I do), but there is always a gross taste if I stick my tongue back there. What can I do?",
