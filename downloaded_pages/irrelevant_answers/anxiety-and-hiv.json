    "question": "Hello.I am a 20 year old male living in the UK.about 3 months ago i had sex with a female whilst drunk, during intercourse a condom broke, i changed the condom for another and finished but when i withdrew i noticed that there was a small hole near the band at the bottom of the condom and it was only covering the top half of my penis, being drunk i didnt worry at the time.recently i started to get quite severe headaches, i ofcourse went to the doctor who maybe misdiagnosed the headaches as Co2 poisoning, but i have had them for so long now i think that may have been wrong, the glands on the side of my neck also feel slightly swollen but they may have always been like this, when i breathe hard through my nostrils it burns a little also, i feel quite tired all the time but that may be due to poor eating and lack of water? furthermore i seem to have lost my appetite a bit, but i cant help but think its all in my head and im just being paranoid. i was wondering what are the chances, from my description of catching HIV if my penis is exposed in this way? I am pretty sure the girl is clean and everything but ive been worried ever since the encounter and am too scared to go for a test, i was also wondering if there is anything else i could look out for?googling my symptoms doesnt help my anxiety and i have been pushed towards thinking i may have some type of migraine or maybe pre-diabetes. Im sure i will go for a HIV test sooner or later but i will remain sexually inactive until im 100% sure, i just needed some advice.Thanks in advance.",
