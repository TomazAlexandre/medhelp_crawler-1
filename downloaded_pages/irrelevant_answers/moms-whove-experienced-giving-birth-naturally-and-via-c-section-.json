I just kept active and didn't baby my situation. It helped. However the experience itself was awful bc I was having active panic attack during it but it differs for everyone lol",

            "answer": "My first was vaginal. 2nd was emergency c section due to ruptured placenta. With vaginal delivery cramping, clotting and overall bleeding was intense. With the creation very little bleeding, no clotting (they completely clean you out) and no cramping. The Incision took about a year to stop hurting and to have actual feeling back. I am now expecting baby 3 and I think I am leaning towards another c section instead of a vbac.",

    "question": "Because I have gestational diabetes my doctor has told me that there is a chance of me just going straight to a c-section if my little guy is too big. And as a first time mom, it honestly scares the poop out of me. I was just curious to know out of both ways to deliver, which did you like best? Which was easier to recover from? And what were your experiences like?",
