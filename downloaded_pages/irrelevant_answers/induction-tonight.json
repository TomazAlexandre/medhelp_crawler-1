            "answer": "I'm 39+3 weeks, my blood pressure has been all over the place. So my doctor asked if I wanted to go ahead and get induced. My last pregnancy I had to be rushed to the hospital because my blood pressure got so highly it was causing the baby heart rate to drop so they induced me right then and there. I rather not risk it a second time around so baby girl is going to have to come out now!! I had ultrasound Wed just to make sure she was in good health and she 8lbs and ready to go.",

        {
            "answer": "No, I didn't mind. I hope all goes well with your little one. I hear it safer to deliver early if the baby is not growing well in the womb. Your baby may not be getting all the things it needs through the umbilical cord. Always better to be safe than sorry! Good luck!",
