            "answer": "The informed consent obviously lists rare complications.\u00a0\u00a0The biggest \"risk\" you probably have is inadequate correction.\u00a0\u00a0The multifocals are usually known for giving \"acceptable\" acuity at most distances, but usually not awesome vision at any distance.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the time you end up sacrificing a little bit of acuity at one or more distances in order to gain all of the distances w/o glasses.I don't know if you are \"jumping the gun\".\u00a0\u00a0This is really a personal descision and a little bit of a gamble no matter what you decide to do.\u00a0\u00a0If you have monofocal IOL's installed, you will almost assuredly need glasses...either reading glasses or dystance vision glasses or both.\u00a0\u00a0The only way for you to stay out of glasses is with a multifocal design.",

            "answer": "Why the rush? From the info you supplied, you have a slow forming (sclerotic) type of cataract that may take another 6-10 yrs before you would definitely require surgery. Especially, since it is not at present interfering with your work! And during this time the entire field of multi-focal implants will have more time to mature.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 67 yr. old physician who recently had a very successful Rezoom/Restor implantation and it only took 2 weeks- after my 2nd implant- until I had excellent (20/20) bilateral uncorrected vision for near, intermediate and distant. But I definitely waited to have my surgery until it was non negotiable.\u00a0\u00a0It took me over 1 month to gather data in regards to which implants would work best for me- given I was determined to be spectacle free after the implants. So give it a lot more thought in the short time you have available. By the way June 1 is tomorrow & Fri is June 2!",

    "question": "I am a dentist, 45+ y/o, with type 2 diabetes, well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0I have worn contact lenses for 36 years.\u00a0\u00a0At my annual dilated eye exam 6 years ago, I was told I had cataracts developing.\u00a0\u00a0We've followed the progress of the cataracts every year at the dilated eye exam.\u00a0\u00a0My most recent exam was approximately 1 month ago and I was told a lense replacement could be done any time.\u00a0\u00a0I have been noticing nighttime vision differences and during the daytime i've had trouble focusing sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0The opthalmologist who examined me recently said my eyes are very healthy otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0I have been getting progressively more presbyopic for a couple years but have not yet bothered to correct it.\u00a0\u00a0We were waiting for the multifocal to come out to in a sense \"kill 2 birds with 1 stone\".\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm still very functional and my dentistry has not been affected by my vision, yet.\u00a0\u00a0I'm scheduled for eye surgery for the ReZoom IOL this Friday, June 1st.My question is - Am I jumping the gun on this?\u00a0\u00a0I've read the informed consent on this and I've got to admit there is some pretty serious complications that can result, not the least of which is inadequate correction requiring glasses or contact lense wear anyway.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone shed some light on this and please state your credentials if you answer.",
