            "answer": "I am 34 years old and have had Type 1 diabetes since I was six years old. I waited to have my first child until I was 30. I suffered one miscarriage, but then had a healthy 8 lb. 13 oz. baby boy. I had two miscarriages before my next baby, but gave birth to my second son in December. He was 3 weeks early and much larger (10 lbs. 2 oz), but is doing very well. I had c-sections with both....the first was breach. My doctor told me birth weight would probably increase with each pregnancy. I tested many, many times a day...before meals and an hour and a half after meals (and any other time I thought I felt different as I tend to obsess over my Bg. readings! )and tried to keep my Bgs. below 100 in the mornings, below 120 before meals and below 140 after meals. It is hard work, but well worth the effort. I took multiple injections during my first pregnancy and was on a pump during my second pregnancy (my choice). I am now back on multiple injections for a while only because I need a pump break. (I tired of having things hanging off of me, but I do like the pump.) Pregnancy is very possible. When you do become pregnant be very aware of your Bgs...particualry in the first trimester. I found that mine could drop into the 20's without symptoms and actually passed out in a Wendy's parking lot during my second pregnancy. I had enough senses about me to down a coke before it happened so everything worked out without an emergency room visit, but it was very scary for me. I was by myself and in my car. Keep your chin up...it is possible....I am anxious to hear from you. Good luck!I laugh every time I watch Steele Magnolias.\u00a0\u00a0Only a person with diabetes who has experienced a low blood sugar can appreciate Julia's acting abilities!!\u00a0\u00a0I think they patterned the mother after mine, too.\u00a0\u00a0Remember...that is a movie and Shelby (the diabetic) already had kidney damage AND had been advised not to get pregnant. It's a good movie, though.\u00a0\u00a0:)",
