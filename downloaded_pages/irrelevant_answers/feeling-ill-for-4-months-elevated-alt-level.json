            "answer": "I would have a 3 hour blood glucose test which measures your clearance of glucose. This would indicate weather you have diabetes or not. If you do, then you may be experiencing some very serious effects from that. Read up on Diabetes if you have not already. Your fasting blood glucose should ideally be below 90. Elevated glucose can lead to fatty liver as a side effect which can lead to elevated liver enzymes and more troubling problems if not corrected. I would also lose some weight. If your Dr. is running out of ideas, go to another dr. until you find out what is going on. I've learned that you have to pursue answers that dr.'s will not continue looking for after standard procedures. Goo luck.",

            "answer": "I don't think you need an oncologist, I'd go see a Heptologist and find out what is going on with your liver. Thanks goodness you tested neg. for all those viruses but there are a lot of liver disorders that have to be ruled out.Your enzymes aren't very high, try not to worry yourself too much but try to get to the bottom of it. I'd not drink alcohol or eat fats and sugars, those are very hard on a stressed liver regardless of the cause.",

    "question": "I've been feeling ill since the beginning of December 2006. I've had a persistent low grade fever (usually starts at 9:30 AM and lasts until about 3:00 PM), occassional diarhhea (has been more of loose stool lately), weight loss (20 lbs), nausea, sweat easily (like when cooking or cleaning), occassional night sweats, cold feet, cold hands, purple at the base of the fingernails, gurgling in the stomach, and gas.I went to the ER in January and had blood work done and a CT scan. The blood work showed I had an elevated ALT level of 54 and high glucose 153, all other levels were normal. The CT scan was of my abdomen and didn't reveal any abnormalities.My blood pressure has been high 142/90, but lately it has been normal. I'm 5'7\" and weight about 175 lbs.I have since had multiple trips to the GI, including an endoscopy and colonoscopy. My latest ALT level was slightly lower at 46, but still elevated.I have been tested for Hep A, B, and C all negative, HIV negative, all stool samples were normal. I have to praise God for that.I am considering having the MD do an ultrasound on my liver to test for any damage/cancer. I don't drink very much and I don't take advil, tylenol, or any other pain relevers. The only med I am on is Prilosec, and that was prescribed after the 54 ALT reading.I've been very stressed and worried, especially waiting for all these test results. I'm at the point where I'm more frustrated than nervous. I just want to figure out what is wrong.Has anyone else had these symptoms, or have any other ideas where I should look, or which doctor I should see? Should I see an oncologist? I can tell my GI is almost out of ideas.Thanks for your help!",
