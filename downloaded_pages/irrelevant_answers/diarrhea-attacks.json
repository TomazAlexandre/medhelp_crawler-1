            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Chronic diarrhea that comes on and off can be due to due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. If celiac, Crohn\u2019s and other problems have been ruled out then lactose intolerance and IBS are the possibilities. Gas in stomach, burping, diarrhea all go in favor of IBS. Pancreatic enzyme disorders, liver dysfunction, HIV, cancer of the gut, and infections by parasites other than giardia can all cause persisting diarrhea. Lyme and lupus are other possibilities that present this way. Please discuss this with your doctor (GI doctor).Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "Once in a while, and by that it could be once every 2 weeks, to 4 times a week, I get random diarrhea attacks. It doesn't hurt and usually it goes by quickly, but other times I have to reuse the toilet 3 times within the hour. I tried cancelling out foods but nothing seems to work. Any diagnosis?",
