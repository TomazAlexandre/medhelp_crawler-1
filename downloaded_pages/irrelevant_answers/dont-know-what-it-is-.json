            "answer": "HiThanks for the post.I think you probably have pustular lesions. \u201cPustules are circumscribed elevated lesions that contain pus. They are most commonly infected (as in folliculitis) but may be sterile (as in pustular psoriasis).\u201d In your case you probably have pustular psoriasis, based on the distribution of the pustules and the fact that they improve with cold temperature. Alternatively pustules have been associated with:1.\t\u201cTaking systemic steroids (steroid medications given by mouth or by injection) and then discontinuing them ,2.\tVarious drugs, including the following: Salicylates, compounds made from salicylic acid, often used to treat pain and fever ,Iodine, a topical antiseptic ,Lithium or trazodone, antidepressants ,Phenylbutazone or oxyphenbutazone, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), Penicillin, an antibiotic ,Hydroxychloroquine, an antimalarial drug ,Calcipotriol, a vitamin-D derivative ,Interferon alfa and recombinant interferon-beta injections, chemotherapeutic agents3.\tStrong, irritating topical solutions (creams or ointments applied to the skin), including tar, anthralin, steroids under occlusion, and zinc pyrithione in shampoo4.\tInfections5.\tPregnancy6.\tSunlight or phototherapy7.\tCholestatic jaundice (a yellowish staining of the skin and eyes, caused by bile)8.\tHypocalcemia (abnormally low levels of calcium in the blood)\u201dMany a times a trigger cannot be identified. It is difficult to diagnose without examining. Please consult a skin specialist and discuss these possibilities with him.Hope this helps. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries. Please keep me posted.",

            "answer": "HiThe list was given as an exercise drill for you to narrow down the possibilities for apart from the post you sent, I have no further details to narrow down the possibilities myself. You did a good job!White spots in vision could be due to \u201ccataract clouding of the natural lens of the eye, usually caused by aging in conjunction with other risk factors, such as exposure to the sun's UV rays, smoking, steroid intake and diabetes. Symptoms include blurred vision, glare, halos around lights, colors that are less bright, a cloudy spot in your vision and, sometimes, temporary vision improvement.\u201d White spots in the eye could also be due to edema of the cornea (eye ball).I think the steroids you took are probably the culprit, but cannot say for sure. Also please test for low calcium in blood (point 8) and diabetes. Please get an eye checkup done and see a skin specialist. They can really help you out because it is difficult to diagnose without clinically examining the patient.Please let me know if there is any thing else. Please keep me posted.",

            "answer": "HiI am glad you are thinking of making an appointment.Diabetes runs in families so it will be wise to take a blood test both 12 hours after fasting (early morning empty stomach) and 2 hours after food to confirm if you have diabetes or not. Sometimes your doctor may also prescribe a Glucose Tolerance Test to see how your body reacts to a challenge (high quantity) of glucose.Elderly people do have Vit B deficiency. This is more food related and rarely hereditary. Sometimes it is due to Pernicious anemia and again that is not hereditary.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else.",
