            "answer": "Dear Andrew,125 isn't so far out of range to be concerned. Many diabetics keep their blood sugars from 70 to 150. i wouldn't consider this to be anything to worry over, as it isn't going to do you any harm and is in the normal range. So count your blessings as i wish i could get mine to do that every time i had fasted. bret",
