            "answer": "I am still here. I will be 38 weeks on Wednesday. I am hoping to be induced next Monday though. I will find out on Thursday if it is possible. I am getting less and less sleep. We are finally getting everything out of storage and ready to go, but we are not quite finished yet so I am hoping that I don't go on my own before next Sunday. I need one more weekend as I am still working full time.",

            "answer": "I'm not as close as you are, but I am sick of bein' preggo already and this diabetes diet is driving me up the wall! Mostly because we don't have the money to buy special foods, so I have to go with tiny amounts of regular foods which usually leaves me feeling like I'm starving to death... and on top of that, I worry about my blood sugar levels too much, so I start having symptoms of being too high or too low when I'm actually fine... GRRRR!!! It's driving me crazy, and I hope it goes away after baby is born... oh, and all the weight I've been losing worries me, too... (so far about 15 lbs.)",

    "question": "I have seen so many of the January ladies post that baby is here. Who is still in this with me? I am so tired of being pregnant, and I feel like crud. I can't wait to go into labor, and still have hope of going on my own. My induction date got changed again, I think for the convenience of my Dr. Originally I was set for tomorrow, and should have gone in tonight for the cervadil. Then he said to go in Tues. night instead for a Wed. induction. Friday when I went to my appointment, the nurse said that he wants to see me Tues, and put me in Wed. night for a Thurs. induction. I'm kind of annoyed, because I had everything all set already for my husband to be off work, and my family to care for my 3 year old. Now everyone has to change their plans. The only good thing is that I have more of a chance of going into labor on my own, which I hope will be easier than my induction with my daughter. To top it all off, I've got a horrible cold which turned to tonsillitis, so I'm on antibiotics, but not feeling better yet. This had nothing to do with my induction date though. That was already screwed up. Anyhow, I am ready and waiting, but only 1 cm, dialated, 50% efaced, and -3 station.",
