            "answer": "LL-lower left, LR- lower rightDry mouth and hypothyroidism is very common, and your dentist or physician should have known this ahead of time if they kept up with current research.\u00a0\u00a0Several things will help if you wish to save your teeth:1) Biotene or Oasis gels, they are basically salivary substitutes and will help keep your teeth hydrated.2) NON-alcoholic mouth rinses.\u00a0\u00a0Cutting out alcohol almost completely from your diet as well.\u00a0\u00a0Alcohol has a drying effect and will accelerate any issues you have.3) Don't smoke - same reason as #34) Prescription toothpaste,\u00a0\u00a0this will contain more fluoride to help protect your teeth from further damage5) Dental cleanings every 3 months, not 66) Xylitol gum - chewing gum with xylitol will help stop bacterial growth and naturally stimulate more salivary flow7) Any filling done from now on should be lined with a glass ionomer, which will release fluoride to help protect the margins.Any dentist who has ever treated someone with severe dry mouth, such as cancer patients, should know this entire list and be able to help you.",

    "question": "I'm a 43 year old female and had my thyroid removed in 2007 due to a suspect nodule. Since then, I've had rapid deterioation of my teeth. Since then I've had two root canals, two crows were unseated and one broke off.\u00a0\u00a0I have a bridge, my first molar extracted. My dentist says that he is seeing rapid decay. This year, I've also experienced sporadic pain that radiated from the LL to LR each month like clockwork.\u00a0\u00a0I eventually got a root canal and crown on one side. Health wise, my calcitonin levels are elevated but my TSH levels are normal. I take synthroid daily, brush, floss, rinse.\u00a0\u00a0Could there be a correlation between thyroid hormone levels and tooth decay. I admit to having extensive dental work, but I've never had this amount of deteriation over the past two years.\u00a0\u00a0 I have normal cholesterol levels, no diabetes, high blood pressure,etc...\u00a0\u00a0My teeth are melting away for lack of better words and I'm not sure why.\u00a0\u00a0The only difference is with the Thyroid removal due to the nodule and diagnosis with Medullary Thy CA as reflected by the elevated calcitonin levels.",
