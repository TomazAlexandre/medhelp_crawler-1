            "answer": "Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis. In some cases you can have both autoimmune diseases at the same time which is called Hashitoxicosis. Sometimes the labs can be normal as both diseases can mess with the labs. In my case I had subclinical hypo labs with major hyper symptoms due to Graves antibodies.The term Hashitoxicosis is also used for the leakage symptoms of active Hashimoto's thyroiditis (in other words hyper symptoms show up on and off usually in the early stages of the disease). I had this type of Hashitoxicosis as well but it's not as bad as the hyper symptoms of Graves antibodies.",
