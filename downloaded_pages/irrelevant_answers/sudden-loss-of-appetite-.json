            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am not sure what you mean by bathroom use\u2014if it is loose stools, then the loss of appetite is due to gut infection. Take an OTC lactobacillus preparation (probiotics) and yoghurt with your meals. Drink plenty of fluids (clear soups, water, ORS in water, lemonade). Eat light, do not stay hungry but eat simple things like toast, porridge, cereals, crackers, banana, rice, peeled apple, etc. Take over the counter antacid and antiemetic (this SOS for vomiting). Watch out for a day or two with this treatment. If it does not help, consult a doctor.Other possibility is that you are having increased frequency of urine. UTI too can make you lose appetite. So treating it will help. You will need to give urine for testing. Antibiotics will be prescribed. You can take probiotics with them. Consult your doctor please. Take care!",
