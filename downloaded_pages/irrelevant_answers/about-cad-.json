            "answer": "There are a lot of people who live a healthy life and still get CAD. For people who are diagnosed CAD although having normal values for cholesterol and bp, the desired levels are lowered further as the normal values turned out to be not good enough for them. So yes, you will probably be on meds for the rest of your life.",

            "answer": "The Cardiologist may have referred to it as a MI but I doubt it. They don't usually give stents for areas of the heart with no blood supply because it dies pretty quick and is irreversible. If after an hour or thereabouts all heart muscle dies which is lacking a blood supply, imagine how it would look after 5 weeks. I think it is likely that you had collateral vessels feeding the right hand side from the left. Opening your right artery would have given a better supply.",
