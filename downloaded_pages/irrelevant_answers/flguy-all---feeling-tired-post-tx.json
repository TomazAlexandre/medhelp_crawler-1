            "answer": "Your diet may be the cause of your feeling tired now, sugar can wear out your adrenals and pancreas. I only treated once and 9 weeks post tx. now and I feel fine, but I have had over 12 hours of bodywork and 10 sauna baths. My diet is very good. Be careful you don't get diabetes with all that sugar. Your car doesn't run well on crummy gas, likewise your body doesn't run well on junk food. Best wishes to you.",

I never want to feel as bad as I did on tx. Two friends of mine got diabetes following tx. It is NO fun.Fl guy said many good things, especially about premature worry can sap your energy. Have a wonderful holiday. We have SO much to be thankful for. Take good care.",

            "answer": "I did the tx in 2004, relapser, geno 3.\u00a0\u00a0Fatigue has been a big part of my life since the early 90s (didnt know what was wrong, not diagnosed at that time).\u00a0\u00a0Before, during and after tx the fatigue has not gone, still suffering to this day.After negotiations by AHCS with a company called All In One Nutrition, they have marketted a product called Hep C Complete, they kindly dropped the price down from $29.95US to $19.95US to help people with hepatitis C afford it, 60 tablets containing Selenium, Milk Thistle and Alpha Lipoic Acid.Ive been trialling it for 9 weeks now, and there is a big difference in my fatigue, I no longer just lie on the couch resting whenever I could, I am more active and have lots more energy.\u00a0\u00a0I am not marketing this product, Im just letting you know what I have come across and how it is working for me.As I am trialling it, I will stop taking it in another week, stop for a 2-3 weeks, see how I am feeling, then go on it again and monitor.\u00a0\u00a0But so far there is a remarkable difference.I am also involved in researching fatigue at this time, its been a long process getting all the studies but it is coming along.\u00a0\u00a0When it is finished I will post the findings.The All In One Nutrition website is at:http://allinone-nutrition.com",

    "question": "Hello FLGuy - Always happy to see you. - in my last post meant briefcase LOL - I do have a concern. Since last weekend I have been feeling very tired.\u00a0\u00a0I remember reading here someone knew thathad relapsed by the return of that Hep C tired feeling. I am a little scared. I don't know if I have felt this all along and haven;t noticed because of everything that had been going on. Has anyone else experienced this?\u00a0\u00a0I am 2 months post tx. My hgb was 13 last dr visit. Have gained back at least 5lbs. Look much better. My diet is horrible. Since tx I have become a sugar addict. Pop tarts, cookies, cereal, anything sweet. That was all I could tolerate while on tx and haven't stopped since.",
