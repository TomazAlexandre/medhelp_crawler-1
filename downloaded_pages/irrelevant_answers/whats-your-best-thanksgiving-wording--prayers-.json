            "answer": "Morning, am grateful to GOD for all that has happened in my life since February he turned everything around for me. Am grateful to be 32 weeks 1 day\u00a0\u00a0pregnant, the longest I have ever been pregnant with a living moving baby that kicks and moves. Am grateful for the awesome husband I have who within the last three months has moved our stuff to storage, bought us a new town house and then in the middle of Minnesota weather moved things to the new house. Am thankful\u00a0\u00a0for my body still hanging in, despite gestational diabetes and preeclamsia. And finally am grateful for the wonderful nurses and doctors who I have been in the hospital with for 2 months, and maybe another month. They truly are my heroes.",
