            "answer": "when you say got tested do you mean that they did blood tests? you can rule out diabetes anaemia and cholestrol problems with a blood test maybe,,but for the thyroid that wouldnt be enough you would need other tests like thyroid scan to be sure because it can cause all of your symptoms..but i have to ask you is the fatigue constant or it only comes during the attacks? have you ever measured your bp when you were feeling dizzy? do you have a fever? how high is your heart rate?",

            "answer": "I agree w. Sara....the thyroid problem could be the base here for your issues.\u00a0\u00a0The holter will be the telling tale tho.\u00a0\u00a0Because you are on meds if your heart is going to throw an off beat it will do it whether or not you're on the holter or not.\u00a0\u00a0The holter is a 24 hour monitor and the meds definately will change your heart function but remember there are windows within 24 hours where the meds are not as effective and that is why we take them daily to maintain.\u00a0\u00a0You may not be having panic attacks as much as what you may be doing to yourself with anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I would def. stay away from ALL caffeine and see if that changes anything for you...no coffee....no colored sodas.....no chocolate,,,,,no sugar.......i am leaning towards your thyroid being the cause of this myself because they are pesky little buggers that can throw the whole system off....good luck w. the holter and let us know...",

    "question": "I am a 32 year old female, in the last 4 months I have been experiencing dizziness, feeling like I am going to faint, headaches, papitations and tiredness, i have been tested for diabetes, aneamia, thyroid and high chloestrol which were all normal, then my doctor thought she heard a heart murmur and referred me to a cardiologist, i had an echo which was normal and two ecg's which were also normal, i am now waiting to be fitted with a heart monitor for a week.This week i went back to my doctor and asked her if i could be experiencing panic attacks (she doesn't think so, neither do i) but she put me on 10mg of citalopram to see if it could be anxiety, i have now received my appointment to be fitted with a heart monitor byt am concerned that the tablets will interfere and i won't get a true reading and any ideas what this could be, i was fit and healthy before and have never experienced these problems?",
