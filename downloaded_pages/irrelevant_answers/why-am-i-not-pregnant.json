If you've been trying for 6 months and are over age 35 you can get a referral to a specialist and further testing. good luck",

            "answer": "I'm going through the same type of thing... a few differences though. My periods have been irregular since my son was born (Nov 05). My doc wants me to start Clomid, but I have to have a period this month to begin it. She (my dr) told me that the prometrium is to make me start my period. I had side effects from the Prometium that are just like bring preggo.. breast tenderness, cramping, dizzyness, tired feeling, etc. Anyway, I was wondering what your dr said about the prometrium helping you get preggo? I was just wondering what other uses they use prometrium for besides starting periods..good luckJennifer",

            "answer": "Thanks for the advice. I have a specialist appointment on Feb.13th. Initial blood work found my thyroid and estrogen levels were fine; but my progesterone levels drastically dropped after ovulation (around 1.2) . I am to do more blood work in a few days looking at my HSG level and my husband has been asked for a semen analysis. This situation seems so surreal to me because we have a 3 1/2 year old son and did not experience any of these difficulties the first time. I am sorry for the depressing comment. I guess I am just a little worried because I had my son at 27 and now 31 heading towards 32 is a little scary.",

    "question": "Blood work 2 montths ago indicated that my progesterone levels were very low and therefore was interfering with my ability to concieve. I was prescribed prometrium and this is my second month. This month I used an ovulator kit and BD on the right days and took prometrium as soon as I ovulated, so why am I not pregnant. I have all the symptoms; but this can also be prometrium side effects. I really do not believe that I am pregnant because I have not experienced any spotting. I am SO frustrated. Has anyone gone through the same experience?",
