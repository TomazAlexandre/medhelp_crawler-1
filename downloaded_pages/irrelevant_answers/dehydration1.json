            "answer": "Hi!If you drink water a lot and yet feel dehydrated, then two things need to be ruled out first. One is diabetes mellitus (high blood sugar) and the other is diabetes insipidus (disorder with increased formation of very dilute urine). If you are passing a lot of urine then apart from these two disorders it can also be urinary tract infection. Working excessively in heat or sun or exercising too much can also make you feel dehydrated. Some electrolyte imbalance in the body can cause similar symptoms. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Hi,Friend, first of all you need to find out the reason behind dehydration, as you said you are drinking water a lot, that\u2019s good. Are you suffering from fever, are you doing excessive exercise regularly, drinking alcohol or taking any medication? These all reason can also cause dehydration. Next thing you have to check the symptoms for it like less urination, dry mouth, feeling dizziness, headache etc.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise it\u2019s a normal kind of thing like after eating any salty food or sweet you feel thirsty. Start drinking water in early morning otherwise refer a doctor.",
