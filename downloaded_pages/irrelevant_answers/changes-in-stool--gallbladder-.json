            "answer": "Talk to your doc about this. Bile is the substance that colors the stool. It's put out as yellowy-green, but as it's acted on by digestion it slowly turns brown. Without the bile, the fecal material would be gray or whitish. So the stools you're having sound like they're not being mixed with bile, or somehow the bile isn't being released into the duodenum. It can be caused by a variety of issues including stones.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The symptoms mentioned could also be caused by cervical spondylosis. Some metabolic disorders like diabetes mellitus and thyroid disorders are known to simulate these symptoms. Please consult your primary care physician who will carry out blood tests and x rays to rule out these conditions. You seem to be very anxious and in pain, take OTC pain medications like Tylenol (acetaminophen) or ibuprofen. Try applying local analgesic creams. Place ice over the painful area every 1-2hrs for pain relief. Practice relaxation techniques like yoga and meditation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
