    "question": "HiI'm 23, circumcised,and have never had sex,oral or otherwise.For 2.5 years I've had a persistent balanitis problem. Its red irritated looking skin immediately under, and slightly around the meatus.I've tried many OTC items in that timeframe to remedy it to no avail.The problem always worsens after masturbation, even without touching the glans while masturbating.I tried once not masturbating for a 2 month period,that didnt help.And I've come to know anyways, if I don't masturbate for a week I'll have a wet dream, which in turn flairs it up.I went to a doctor for the first time about my balanitis 12 days ago, he prescribed nystatin triamcinolone.Its helped, though the problem is still there some.The thing is,during those 12 days,I masturbated only once, so this is a factor in the apparent relief.I know if I masturbate the problem will present itself more conspicuously,for the next day(s).Should I masturbate as I like while following a prescribed balanitis treatment, for there is perhaps a better representation of how affected my glans still is by balanitis?I don't want to go back to the doctor and them treat it as nearly gone, when in reality if I'd masturbated 3x a week or a couple days prior the area would be redder. I dont want them to send me on my way, when if I'd go home and masturbate the problem will present itself conspicuously.I'd like to be able to masturbate more, and I worry about balanitis significantly affecting my sex life/relationships with future girlfriends.I sincerely and deeply appreciate your responseThank you",
