Talk to your doctor about this, Has this just happened since you became pregnant or have you had this a while.Another thing is some medications\u00a0\u00a0make you thirsty are you on any meds???",

            "answer": "I know I am always thirsty too.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that it can be a sign of diabetes, but I also think it can be because when you are pregnant you urintate much more than usual. I know that they recommend pregnant women to drink alot of water.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure about the cold extremities... maybe it is because your blood flow is in high demand making that precious little one of yours and so your circulation isn't what it used to be.\u00a0\u00a0Just a thought.\u00a0\u00a0I'd definitely contact your doctor though and just let him know what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you!",
