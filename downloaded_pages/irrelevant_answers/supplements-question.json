            "answer": "There does seem to be an increasing interest in vitamins & supplements.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a physician ot a nutritionist, and I would recommend you talk with your doctor about your question.\u00a0\u00a0There are plenty of supplements lining supermarket shelves and it sure is difficult to figure out which ones can be a real benefit (to the consumer) and which ones simply add profits to the sellers' bottom line.Since some of these products can be a benefit and some can interfere with medications or other conditions, it's very important to discuss with your doctor --who has the most information about you and also the particulars of your condition.\u00a0\u00a0Some docs are flatly against supplementation and they see it as simply a way to create \"expensive urine.\"\u00a0\u00a0It might take some shopping around to find a knowledgeable doctor who shares your interest in supplementation.",
