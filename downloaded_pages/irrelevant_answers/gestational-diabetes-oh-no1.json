            "answer": "I had to see a diabetes specialist before they let me retake my 2 hour glucose test which came back perfect.During those 2 weeks I had to eat a certain diet which consisted of 3 carbs for breakfast, 1 carb for an A.M snack, 4 carbs for lunch, 1 carb for P.M snack, 4 carbs for dinner and 2 carbs for evening snack...of course i also had to eat proteins and veggies as well included with the carbs.....It was actually alot of food too eat and didn't get everything in everyday. I also had to test my blood 4 times a day and check my keytones, which is the peeing on a stick thing.Good luck to you and when you do have to take the glucose test, try not to eat any sweets for a couple days before.",
