    "question": "Hello this past Sunday July 19th I wrecked my dirt bike into the dirt. I slid across the dry dirt causing a friction burn on my left arm. I cleaned it with rubbing alcohol and hydrogen peroxide whenever I got home but that wasn't until a few hours after I crashed. For the past few days I have been experiencing pain on my wound it seems like the pain has been constant since the incident. On Tuesday July 21st I noticed clear and yellow discharge on the wound it is very sticky. The would also smells bad like wet dog. Do you think I should get it examined by a doctor? Thank you for reading. I will also answer any questions you have :)",
