            "answer": "Hello,Some of the important causes of leg cramps are overextension of the muscles,overweight,prolonged standing during the day,dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium,calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism,peripheral vascular disease(narrowing of the leg arteries which causes poor circulation),sarcoidosis,excess alcohol,nerve compression, and sometimes liver disease.Some of these causes like dehydration,being overweight,alcohol intake and prolonged standing are modifiable by efforts of the patient. Stretching and massaging the affected muscle (usually a calf muscle) can usually relieve an attack of cramp. A painkiller such as paracetamol may help to ease muscle discomfort and tenderness that sometimes persists for up to 24 hours after a cramp has gone.You are also having hypothyroidism which can relate to cramps in muscles as well as drying and brittleness of hair.The changes in your nails i.e red line can be due to Lupus or connective tissue disease and the wavy pattern or indentation of the nails can be attributed to Psoriasis or inflammatory arthritis.To sum up, the possibilities for your symptoms can be due to hypothyroidism,Connective tissue disorder or arthritis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.",
