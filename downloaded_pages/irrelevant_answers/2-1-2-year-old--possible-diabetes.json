Sometimes, kids can have high blood sugars from illness.I wouldn't mess around. I'd take him to a hospital. Kids can become very sick be in a life and death situation quickly.Have you been to the Children With Diabetes forum? Go there and ask for advice. http://forums.childrenwithdiabetes.com/Diabetes in children is nothing to mess around with. The sugar over 300 is very worrying.Good luck. I'm sorry that you're going through this. I hope he doesn't have diabetes, but you can't take any chances.",

            "answer": "I'll check back in to see how you're doing. The CWD forum I gave you the link for above is excellent. If your little guy does have T1, it will be an excellent resource for day-to-day management and to help you with support emotionally. There are several toddlers with T1 on the forum and there are also a number of parents who have T1 with T1 kids.Take care of yourself. It ***** to wait to find out what's happening.",

            "answer": "I'm new to this forum , but when I saw the subject line \"21/2 year old, possible diabetes\", it caught my attention, because our daughter (who is 8 now) was diagnosed with Type 1 3 months after her 2nd birthday. Please let us know what you found out at the doctor's this morning. I'm so sorry you are going through this. I can't imagine how scary it must be for you to think about your 2 y.o. having T1, since you are T1 yourself. A fasting blood sugar of 138 is high and a BS of 198 is high, even though it was after a meal. The fact that you have tested him and gotten numbers in the 200s and 300s is very concerning!There are so many issues that are unique to managing a very young child with T1 diabetes. So, if that is the outcome (which I will be praying is NOT!), I would love to answer any questions and chat here with you about it anytime.",
