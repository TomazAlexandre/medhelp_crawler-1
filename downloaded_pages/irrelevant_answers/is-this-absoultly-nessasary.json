            "answer": "Hello,Is the lack of touch sensation confined to just one arm? If not I would begin by getting tested for diabetes. Chronic (long term) unmanaged diabetes can lead to a condition known as peripheral neuropathy (loss of feeling). If just present on one particular limb I would be thinking along the lines of a nerve intrapment possiblely from a injury but not always.Make sure you are eating a healthy well balanced diet containing sodium, potassium and calcium as they are involved in nerve inpulses. They are some conditions which attack the nervous system but they are much further on in the diagnosis. Any further question feel free to ask.RegardsDr Foot",
