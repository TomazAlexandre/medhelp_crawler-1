            "answer": "Here are some tips I posted on another thread some time ago....Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. Restrict & avoid refined sugars, practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing this illness, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity. Walking, not strolling, helps to lower blood sugar levels.Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates (starches) carefully too. For example-- avoid things made with white flour like breads, crackers, etc., and potatoes and pasta which can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. (They are converted quickly to sugar after you eat them.)Other foods/drinks need care too (example; milk, fruit, fruit juice) can also cause blood sugar to rise (so serving sizes and moderation are important). With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose (fruit sugar). I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics. Avoid tropical fruits such as pineapples, mangoes, guava for they contain high amounts of fructose. For low carb recipes go to the Atkins web site.Be sure your mother regularly sees her doctor and takes her medication as instructed. Good luck -",

            "answer": "All foods may be eaten in moderation if you have diabetes, but too many carbohydrates may increase your blood glucose levels. Carbohydrates break down into sugars easily, so healthy carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes such as beans and peas and low-fat dairy products should constitute the majority of this food group. Fiber-rich foods such as vegetables, nuts, legumes and whole grain products help to control blood sugar levels and are excellent choices as part of a diabbetic diet. Fish are a good source of protein and a healthy alternative to higher-fat options such as red meat. Foods that are high in fat, such as cakes and cookies, or that are high in simple sugars, such as soda, should be avoided",
