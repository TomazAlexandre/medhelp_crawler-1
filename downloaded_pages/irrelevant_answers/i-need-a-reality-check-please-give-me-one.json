            "answer": "First of all, what do you mean by you are \"headed for diabetes\"? Have you been checked? Did your doctor say you are pre-diabetes? Not everyone who eats sweets (or is overweight) gets diabetes. However if you are pre-diabetic, then yes, you do need to stop eating sweets. Type 2 Diabetes at its worst is an extremely serious condition which can lead to serious complications such as blindness, amputation and kidney failure. At its best it is something that takes daily managing and requires a drastic change in lifestyle. Once you have done that, and get into a routine, no, it is not terrible and you aren't sick. But if you ignore it, it won't go away. And if you eat a diet full of sweets and other carbs, are overweight and get no exercise, and you are prediabetic...you are in for a very rough road indeed. The good news is that many people with type 2 diabetes say they are glad they got the wake-up call of diabetes because it has helped them to change their lives for the better.As for sweets and other carbs, they are addictive and when you try and lower your intake you will get cravings. But once you make the change you won't miss it after awhile. I haven't eaten sugar in 16 years and when I've gotten a sugar drink by mistake it tasted nauseating to me! I'm not hungry, I'm not on a miserable diet. I cook, and enjoy a wide variety of food. Oh yeah, and I've got acid reflux (had it many years before my diabetes diagnosis)I'm a lot older than you. Youve got a lot of years to live healthy or else develop complications from high blood sugars. Look at it this way which do you want more a piece of cake or your eyesight, a dish of ice cream or your legs?",

However, these are people who mostly manage their diabetes very well. What is scary is those who don't. The people who have legs amputated, are blind and have kidney failure.",

            "answer": "What's it like living with diabetes? Out of control blood sugar is NOT fun.\u00a0\u00a0Once controlled, you have a normal life except for taking meds, exercise and eating a nutrition meal.\u00a0\u00a0Of course the last two should be done anyway and more people wouldn't be in this situation.What are the major cons/discomforts? Out of control are excessive thrist, extreme fatigue, frequent bathroom breaks..but it varies from person to personWhat is the worst about diabetes? (besides that 'you can't have sweets') I do still have the occassional small ice cream or mini-candy bar.\u00a0\u00a0I have the sweet tooth too.\u00a0\u00a0But when you start to not eat it all the time, you WILL start to not crave it.\u00a0\u00a0And white carbs are BAD!!\u00a0\u00a0White bread, white rice, too many potatoes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0They are simple carbs and will turn to sugar way too quickly.\u00a0\u00a0The COST is also an eye opener.\u00a0\u00a0Between oral meds, insulin and supplies, I pay around $120 a month at the pharmacy.\u00a0\u00a0And I know have high blood pressure I didn't have before I was diagnosed.Is it really THAT bad? If your blood sugar goes out of control, it's death bad.\u00a0\u00a0I have known people to lose toes, which in turn messes up their whole balance.\u00a0\u00a0If you want to have a child, your sugars better be under control or your kid can have tons of problems...a major one being born without an appendage (that's what got me to get on insulin to get mine under better control)What are the daily challenges? You can go on with a normal life, you just have to check your blood, eat healthy meals and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0But then again, the last two is what we should be doing anyway.Do you actually feel sick or nauseous?\u00a0\u00a0When my blood sugar is high, I am extremely tired, grouchy (my hubby can attest to that) and just don't feel right.\u00a0\u00a0On the opposite end, with a low I get shaky, sweaty, and it takes about half a day to get to feeling back to normal afterwards.",
