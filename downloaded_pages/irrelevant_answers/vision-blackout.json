            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If your suffer from episodes of blackouts then those could be due to postural hypotension (falling with change of position\u2014most likely in your case), internal ear problems, cervical spondylitis, anemia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems. In postural or orthostatic hypotension blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain internal ear problems (benign positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, vestibular neuronitis, labyrinthitis, otitis media, trauma, side effects of drugs, and fluid in ear) can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required. I think you should discuss this with your doctor. Get your blood pressure checked. Hope this helps. Take care!",
