            "answer": "The previous poster is confusing Group B strep infection and yeast infection.\u00a0\u00a0Group B strep infection is generally only an issue for pregnant women and a very small number of their infants.\u00a0\u00a0It has no real symptoms and is often detected by a simple swab test when you are about 35-36 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0It would have nothing to do with you right now in any event.The symptoms of a yeast infection are generally intense vaginal/vulval itching along with a \"cottage-cheese\" white discharge.\u00a0\u00a0If you think you might have a yeast infection but aren't sure, you should see a doctor to get a definate diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0You could try something over the counter for yeast, but if it isn't yeast, that won't help.Pregnancy is diagnosed by a urine or blood test in most cases. You absolutely can't tell by symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0You don't say why you are frightened to go to the the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Is it because you are young, or are you simply afraid of the doctor?",
