            "answer": "Yes I do and i also get jittery and shaky at different times thru the day, everyday, even when i'm not having a panick attack or nervous about anything. Not sure if thats true for everyone but I know it is for me. Sometimes my shakyness seems worse when i'm up doing things like cooking dinner, dishes, ect...Not sure if my nerves are just shot or if it's the anxiety but it gets bothersome for me.God Bless",

            "answer": "Sounds like your having anxiety still and it could be from fear of having another panic attack or just lingering anxiety. For some reason a panic attack was triggered out of nowhere and that's how an anxiety disorder starts out for many people. Also, once you have a panic attack there may be signs of anxiety that stay with you since a panic attack is classified as an anxiety disorder. So, you may not have another panic attack or you may not but you also may have signs of anxiety that don't trigger an attack as well that will stay with you or come and go in intensity. Get checked out and just research anxiety disorders on the net.",

            "answer": "I research anxiety like crazy, my fiance thinks sometimes that I read to much into things but in all reality it really makes me feel better knowing more about it.\u00a0\u00a0Im in the process of finding a family doctor since I dont think my ob/gyn can really do much for me in this case. A lot of the places I have been calling arent accepting new patiants or I cant get an appt for months which I really dont want to have to go through the holidays feeling like this, and also I have a big family vacation coming up in April that is paid for so I have no choice but to go. (or lose out on a lot of money lol)\u00a0\u00a0I know that anxiety runs in my family, my mother and aunt both have it.\u00a0\u00a0My mom takes some kinda pill to help calm her down and once in a while she will give me half of one to help me out. But she doesnt have anxiety as bad as me, and I really dont want to be taking something that isnt prescribed to me. Till I get an appt. I guess I will have to just deal with this the best I can!thanks again :)",
