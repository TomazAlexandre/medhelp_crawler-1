Short outings on weekend or family get-together can make you more active. Do morning evening walk, stretches, have nutritious diet with lot of water or other liquids, have hot shower and listen to soft music before going to bed, these can be soothing to mind and body so it may be of some help. Few sessions of massage therapy can be beneficial. Mild dose of alprax also can be tried. Keep updating of any visit to neurophysician or sleep specialist. Take care.",

            "answer": "I would definately get a sleep study done. Waking up snoring or making noises to the such can mean a breathing disorder disrupting your sleep. Also your work shift switch could have thrown off your circadian rythym. When our bodies do not spend time in the proper sleep stages it can wreak havoc on us physically and mentally.Stress can certainly increase a sleeping issue and sometimes the sleeping issue can cause us to feel stressed.Try to excercise at least 15 minutes a day not close to bed time though and watch caffeine intake near bedtime too.\u00a0\u00a0Make a sleep log of what time you go to bed, wake up and how many times you wake during the nite, and seek out a sleep specialist, who can help you pinpoint what is causing you to wake up so many times.Best Wishes~",

            "answer": "Hi all,Waking up several times a night is a symptom of depression, *even* if you do not \"feel\" depressed and have no other signs or symptoms of the condition. If typical sleep remedies/enhancers such as benadryl, melatonin, valerian, magnesium, etc. fail, and you do not have sleep apnea, you need to know this. Depression does not have to be spurred by an external event -- it can come on from within (endogenous depression), for reasons that are not known. Taking an SSRI can alleviate your sleep problem. Please see a psychiatrist that specializes in depression/anxiety. Wishing you the best of luck!",
