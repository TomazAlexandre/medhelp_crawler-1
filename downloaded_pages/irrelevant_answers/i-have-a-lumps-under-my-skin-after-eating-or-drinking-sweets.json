            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm anything without examination but it can be infected hair follicles or boils. Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders. So please get your blood sugar evaluated.I hope that helps. Take care and regards.",
