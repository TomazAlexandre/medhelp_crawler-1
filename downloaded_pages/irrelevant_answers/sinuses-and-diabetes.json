            "answer": "We are not physicians, so be warned that my response is based on many years as a type 1 diabetic and on what I have read and learned from other diabetic people. I am not aware of any relationship between diabetes and sinus problems. However, in type 1 diabetes, the immune system is active in that it attacks the pancreas' insulin-producing cells, and allergies of course happen when the immune system reacts to the substances that you are allergic to. So an active immune system may be a factor in either situation.As for symptoms, bad-smelling breath can be a symptom of uncontrolled diabetes... the breath is said to smell \"fruity\" when diabetes is not controlled. I would recommend that you watch for the other major symptoms of diabetes: fatigue, weight loss, and excessive thirst and frequent urination as a result of drinking lots of liquids.If you feel that something is not right, then perhaps you should see your doctor and have him or her check your glucose levels. A very simple blood test will show whether or not your blood sugar levels are normal. I hope you find out that your fears are wrong.",

    "question": "I'm allergic to 6 different foods and try to avoid them as much as possible, but for some reason over the past few months foods that I'm not allergic to containing large amounts of sugar have been messing with my sinuses. I'll eat a potatoe or an apple and it just feels like the sugar sits there and makes my breath smell bad and all that good stuff, so I'm wondering if it could be diabetes-related. I know I have a problem with regularing sugar i.e. it feels like it just sits in my system and doesn't do anything, but I'm not sure what it is exactly. I haven't been diagnosed with diabetes or hypoglycemia but I'm positive something's wrong with my blood sugar, so I'm just curious if anybody here would know. Thx",
