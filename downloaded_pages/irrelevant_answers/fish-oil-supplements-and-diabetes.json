            "answer": "\"I've read that\u00a0\u00a0fish oil supplements can raise your FBS and shouldn't be taken by diabetics.\"Tell us where you read this; magazine, book or link? I'd like to see how they conducted their testing and whether or not it was on humans, not lab mice/rats. Always read the nutrition label carefully. Also make sure you're not allergic to seafood products like shellfish which some fish oil contain. Fish oil does not raise blood sugar levels. If it does, I would suspect an allergy to seafood as the cause.This link is a study on 832 humans with results showing no adverse effects on blood sugar levelshttp://tinyurl.com/fish-oil-glucose-studyAnd this pdf file care.diabetesjournals.org/content/21/4/494.full.pdfPersonally, I have been taking fish oil for the past 10-12 years and have had zero adverse effects.",
