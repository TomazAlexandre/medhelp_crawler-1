            "answer": "A little more info. regarding hypoglycemia:Do you have other symptoms such as getting hot and break out in a sweat,\u00a0\u00a0feeling confused or perhaps depressed or irritable, or yawning for no reason. This can happen to people when they have not eaten in a long time or if they eat something that has a lot of quickly digested carbohydrates that cause the pancreas to be stimulated too much. What happens is that the pancreas produces too much insulin, which is the OPPOSITE of being diabetic, whereby the pancreas does not produce enough insulin.A glucose tolerance test is used to test for reactive hypoglycemia, which is when a person becomes hypoglycemic after eating high-sugar foods. However some people can test normal when having symptoms.You can try dietary changes to see if this helps ease the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Eating a small amount of a complex carbohydrate with some protein. Cheese with crackers, or an apple and cheese, or nuts and some similar high-fiber carbohydrate may make you feel better. Another fix for the symptoms is milk. One cup of milk may make the symptoms go away without triggering a worse reaction, for milk contains carbohydrates that are slowly digested.",

    "question": "For a while now (approximately two months) I have been feeling generally unwell. A little bit after I eat I begin to get the shakes (particularly in my hands) and feel dizzy. After some time the shakes go away, but come back again after I eat something. The more I eat the worse the shakes get. My vision has also worsened and I often have diarrhoea straight after eating (but it is not normal diarrhoea as my body just cant seem to process what I eat). I often get abdominal pain on the upper left side.I went to the doctors who did a blood test which came back saying that I had high levels of adrenaline. The doctor just told me to have another blood test in three months to see if the results are still the same. I am about to move overseas for six months and dont want this hanging over my head.If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated!Cheers",
