            "answer": "Hi.At present, is your BG levels adequately controlled? If yes, are you still experiencing any seizures? If your answer is no, it is likely that the previous seizures you experienced are related to low BG levels and not because of epilepsy.If you are confident that you are adequately managing your BG levels and have had no seizures as of late, I would advise you to consult your neurologist to ask to be put off the antiepilepsy medication, at least for a trial period, to see whether any seizures would occur in spite of adequate glucose control. You should also inform your endocrinologist about this.Good luck.",

    "question": "I am a diabetic, over the last year my blood sugar was a bit out of controll i had a couple of seizures which would be normial for a diabetic person with extremley low BG.\u00a0\u00a0I had one really bad seizure,after a night of staying out and possibly drinking to much, which was a mistake on my part knowing that alcohol lowers the BG for a diabetic, so from what i was told was the worst one yet, the paramedics were called but by the time they got their i all ready had some stuff to get my BG up. when they got their they checked my BG, i was at about 130 but still really out of it and confused. they recomended i go to the ER just to be safe so I did. When i went to the ER and told them i had had a seizure they immidiatley told me to get everything checked out with a nuroligist, so I did, the nuroligist told me to have an mri and an eeg the mri came back prefect nothing wrong but the eeg came back abnormial, they also had me take a 24hr eeg but that too came back abnormial, so they put me on medication, but I have never had a seizure that wasn't caused by low blood sugars. I feel fully confident that it was not epilepsy but my nuroligist seems undecided. The Dr. told me it was a gray area and that there was no for sure way to know if it was a seizure or just low blood sugar. I took the medication but had one or two more low blood sugars that still brought the same symptoms, but they still want to keep me on the medication keppra. I recently went on an insulin pump and have had much better controll and\u00a0\u00a0have almost eliminated exstremly low BG levels. I have no idea what to do. everytime i go to the Dr they tell me I have epilepsy, my endocronoligist says i don't it was just cause by poor diabetes managment. I seem to be stuck in limbo with the symptoms because both people with epilepsy and diabetes have the same symptoms associated with seizures.",
