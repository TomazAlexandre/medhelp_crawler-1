It can happen and yes, the fear of \"something:\" happening is there, but it is so much HYPE.\u00a0\u00a0All my friends (same age) have gone on to have healthy pregnancies in early/mid 40's.The best pre-natals I found are the ones they sell at GNC (folic acid, etc) and i take low dose baby aspirin. The cheap pre-natals cause stomach problems in my opinion (all the fillers in them)Good luck! Keep us posted!",

I hope you lots of luck. my husband is 12years younger than me. we are ttc for 9 months now i'm 36.",
