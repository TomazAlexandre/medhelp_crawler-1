    "question": "I tore my hamstring in three places two years ago. Lots of rehab later I am finally able to jog again. Up until now have done other cross training or walking activities, and lots of stetching, rolling of the hamstring.I started jogging three weeks agin, doing a Runners World training program of 5 weeks to a 5k. It is going fine, and while my leg is not 100% I have only minor pain, But....my foot on the leg with the tear gets pins and needles during the run and for a few hours later. Could this be nerve damage, something else? Should I be concerned enough to check with my doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Any other thoughts?thank you",
