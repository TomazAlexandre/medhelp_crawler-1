            "answer": "Unfortunately, no one can give you a solid answer because everyone is different. It is common to lose it in one clump or a little bit over an extended period of time easily lasting a couple of weeks. I wish that we could tell you more, but you could go into labor in one minute or in several weeks. Best wishes to you!",

    "question": "Please, can anyone give me a straight answer? It seems as if no woman i know can tell me anything. Seems like everyone gets induced these days so its hard to get a straight or i don't know answer! But my question is this! I have already lost my mucus plug (as far as i can tell) but for the past 3 days i been losing more and more mucus and each time there comes more. How much of this do i or will i be losing befor labor actually begins? Because with my first child i was induced, i did lose my plug then too but it only came out once and that was it.",
