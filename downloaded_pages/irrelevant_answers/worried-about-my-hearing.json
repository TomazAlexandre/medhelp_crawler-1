            "answer": "The symptoms that you are experiencing when being in a building or near a building, may be panic attacks.\u00a0\u00a0You may have a condition called claustrophobia.It is irrelevant that the other students do not have the same symptoms than you.\u00a0\u00a0What is important, is that you have symptoms and feel unwell when in that room.\u00a0\u00a0It may be that it is because of some of the chemicals that you are more sensitive too than the others, the fact that here is no ventilation, no window - and also it may just be that you feel overwhelmed being in a confined space.With regard to your symptoms with your short term memory and being lost for words, make an appointment to see your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes these symptoms can be due to a urinary infection, lacking in Vitamin B12, being anaemic (having low iron levels), lack of sleep, stress or depression, sometimes cardiovascular problems.It is highly likely that your symptoms are due to lack of sleep and stress with all the college work that you have.\u00a0\u00a0But you do need to get checked out by your doctor to find out for sure so that you can get the appropriate medication if this is needed.Make sure that you get adequate sleep and eat a healthy and well balanced diet with lots of fresh fruit and veg.\u00a0\u00a0Cut out or cut down on processed foods, cakes, biscuits, fizzy drinks etc.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you drink enough fluids during the day.\u00a0\u00a0Being dehydrated can also make your memory be not so good.\u00a0\u00a02 litres of water a day is usually recommended, but you will need to drink more if you work out and sweat.If you wish to stop smoking, ask your doctor for help.\u00a0\u00a0In the UK a doctor can help people to stop smoking.\u00a0\u00a0One cigarette contains 92 carcinogens, not to mention the cost that I am sure you have better things to spend your money on.Lymphoma usually presents with swollen lymph nodes and you will know how your sister was when she got diagnosed with this.\u00a0\u00a0 But if you are concerned, you should speak to your doctor.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "has your sister been tested for ebv new research has shown that it is linked to hodgkins and other cancers .almost everyone has it .generally it does not cause symptoms.but it can be chronic if your family members had it there is a good chance you would .chronic epstein barr can show these symptoms or a recent infection.also over time ebv can make your neutrophils go low . just wondering if anybody was checked for hereditary\u00a0\u00a0immune disorders .weaker immune systems sometimes have a lower resistance to allergens .concrete buildings ,underground structures tend to be a little more damp and probably harbor greater concentrations of mold.could be a possible explanation as to why you feel the way you do while inside these non breathable buildings.so it could very well be a mold allergy if it is only happening in concrete buildings.just a few scenario's to consider sounds like something you want to present to your doctor .hope you can find an explanation.good luck mogirl1.",

    "question": "I have been having issues with my hearing for 2 yrs now. Any time I walk into a building made of concrete or a building that is under ground or even a movie theater, I always start to have hearing issues. These are my symptoms: My hearing will start fading in and out as if in tune with my heart beat. My head feels like its in a bubble. I will start getting pressure in my eyes and its almost like I'm looking in a tunnel. This makes me dizzy and I have to stop and stand or get assistance so I don't fall over. All these symptoms go away once I leave the building. Again this has been going on for 2 yrs, and mostly happens while in one of these buildings. Sometimes it happens without being in these buildings but for the most part its only while in these type of buildings. I am a little over weight, I smoke, drink coffee but not in excess. other than that I am in good health. I was diagnosed with glaucoma 5 yrs ago. Lately I have had trouble with short term memory and I am a college student and find at times I am at a lost for words, simple words which is frustrating!!! This has been going on for a year. My mother died of a brain tumor, Her mother died of a stroke, her father died of diabetes complications. Do not know much about my fathers side. He has heart disease and diabetes. My sister had Hodgkin Lymphoma.\u00a0\u00a0thats the only serious family issues I know of.",
