Since then I get intermittent dizziness and am in even more pain (pain is always in my eyebrows/eye socket region, not sure where yours is?) and now I am having another mri.",

            "answer": "Hope you're feeling better soon. I've read a few threads here and you seem to be one of the more active members/giving quite a lot of advice, and have suffered with a pituitary tumor for 12 years before removal right? Just curious, did you have initial mri that was normal? And did you go through periods where your symptoms would settle before getting worse again during all those years?I've been symptomatic for over 10 years and I have read that people with pituitary tumors can have them for many years before they finally get them treated.",

            "answer": "Yes, I had an MRI the year before I had an MRI that found my tumor.\u00a0\u00a0Looking back, some doctors see the tumor there on that one.I also was read as having a tumor on the left side for 12 years, and the week before surgery, my pre-op MRI said I had a lesion on the right. That was my first dynamic pituitary MRI.\u00a0\u00a0Surgery revealed I had a prolactinoma on right and the left lesion flattened out and was all over the left.My symptoms initially were more the prolactinoma related one, lactation etc. then I got more Cushing's symptoms. I was of course told I was fine and the pituitary had nothing to do with it. I was nearly dead by the time of diagnosis with no immune system and forget healing (no diabetes!).\u00a0\u00a0I know I was sick way before they found the tumors.I know one lady that took 35 years, and pretty much it takes a decade for most. I figure if I can help people test correctly, which held me back a lot, maybe I can help shave some years off.",
