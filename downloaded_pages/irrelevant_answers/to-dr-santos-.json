            "answer": "How are you? Lexapro is an antidepressant in a group of drugs called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). Lexapro affects chemicals in the brain to improve depression or anxiety.The usual side effects of lexapro intake may include :\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0feeling nervous, restless, or unable to sit still;\u00a0\u00a0headache, trouble concentrating;\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0drowsiness, dizziness; insomnia; nausea, diarrhea, heartburn; weight changes; decreased sex drive, impotence, or difficulty having an orgasm; or dry mouth, ringing in your ears. (http://www.drugs.com/lexapro.html)Aside from yeast infection, stress, menopause and sexually transmitted diseases, vaginal itching can also be due to chemical irritants that may be found in detergents or soaps, douches and vaginal creams, toilet paper, bath products, feminine hygiene products, and vaginal contraceptive products. Women in the menopausal transition may experience vaginal itching due to fluctuations in estrogen levels which leads to thinner and drier vaginal wall resulting to itching.However, due to its cyclical occurrence, it suggests the involvement of hormones.A urinalysis would also help in ruling out infection in your urinary tract.(http://pennhealth.com/ency/article/003159.htm)Do you have a family history of diabetes? You are right in saying that frequent urination is one sign of diabetes together with excessive thirst, excessive hunger, weight loss and fatigue Talk to your doctor for another glucose test if the previous test was already a year ago to determine if there are changes in your glucose levels.

    "question": "To: Dr. SantosHello. I've been having this problem (frequent urination) pretty good for about 1 year now. I feel tired a lot and I have a outer itching on my vaginal area around my monthly cycle time but I don't have a yeast infection because I've been tested for this many times. I take 20 mg of Lexapro daily and on other medicine. About one year ago, I had a glucose test done at my annual pelvic exam visit, and my sugar was higher than usual but not diabetic. I'm wondering if I might be having diabetic symptoms and not even know it for sure or if it's just a side effect of me taking Lexapro.LLFGirl",
