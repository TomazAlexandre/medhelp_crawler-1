            "answer": "If I had diabetes I wouldn't feel correct either. In fact, I don't feel \"correct\" because I am unhealthy. I do know that blood sugar levels have a huge impact on mood and energy. If yours are fluctuating extremely because of insulin resistance it would really make sense that you would be either very angry at times or very tired and depressed. The alcohol usage is not helping at all..just making things much worse, but fluctuating blood sugar levels can make you crave alcohol. So that's something you need to get help for..too bad it seems you don't have someone in your life who is there for you at this moment.And this is just a response from a lay person who understands how important diet is to health and mood. At a low point you might not \"care\" anymore about anything but maybe that's just because you feel like you couldn't control it anyway. You can, though. There is a lot you can do with diabetes, assuming it is adult onset type 2. You can even reverse it through proper diet. You may want to research the effects of dietary magnesium on diabetes...meanwhile, since you are already on medications you might want to seek someone out IRL who can get you off them, like the Dr. here who answers these.",
