            "answer": "I am also another volunteer here. I've had Type I diabetes for over 10 years. Was diagnosed at 18. I don't have any children yet but I understand how you feel because having a helathy pregnancy and child in the future is always on my mind. However, interestingly enough I had never really worried too much about my child being diabetic since I don't believe that Type I diabetes in hereditary. No one in my family has it and anyone I've met with Type I diabetes is also the only one in their family. So I don't believe your child is at any more risk of developing diabetes, even though both you and your husband have it. I think the suggestions above are right on the money, though. Find a good OB/GYN specializing in diabetic and complicated pregnancies -they will be able to give you more information and facts regarding your concerns.As far as having a healthy baby and pregnancy with diabetes: your endo and the OB/GYN will work with you in ensuring everything goes smoothly. There are also wonderful resources out there for mothers-to-be with Type I Diabetes. The American Diabetes Association has two very good books (I have them): \"Diabetes and pregnancy\" and \"101 tips for a healthy pregnancy with diabetes\", which you can get through their website, amazon.com or book stores. So talk to your doctor to put your mind at ease and I wish you and your husband all the best in starting a family. Good luck!",

            "answer": "JW is right that it was long believed that, as an autoimmune disease, Type 1 had no genetic component.Current research, however, speaks to the contrary altho' the specific increased risk is not certain.\u00a0\u00a0This line of research emerged in part because of increasing numbers of Type 1s in a given family.Some research suggests that there are even differnt TYPES of type 1 -- that may have different root causes.When my sister (also type 1) decided to start a family, she & her hubby asked that we all participate in some type of genetic evaluation by giving a small amount of blood for analysis.\u00a0\u00a0That was more than 20 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Based on the results from our family & her hubby's family, they were told they had a 5% (5 out of 100) chance of a child dveloping diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In the general population, I believe the number is much less.They have 2 children.\u00a0\u00a0One developed diabetes at age 4.My point is taht genetic tests can give you some indication of the risks, and yet since no one has complete information on the genetic/environmental \"mix\" that results in Type 1, the info you get (which WILL be better than was available 20+ years ago) will still be an estimate.Many Type 1 diabetics have children who do not develop diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Others aren't so lucky.\u00a0\u00a0There is no certainty at this point.",

Unfortunately, I would think they are higher than 2% but you are seeing what is out there first before you conceive and the is the best way to start.If I find amy information out, I will post it as this affects me as much you.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best for whatever your choice.",
