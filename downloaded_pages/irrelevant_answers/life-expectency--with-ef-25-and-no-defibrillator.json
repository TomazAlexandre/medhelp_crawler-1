            "answer": "bkem,For a variety of reasons, one cannot predict with any accuracy life expectancy based simply on the ejection fraction seen on an echocardiogram. First, the ejection fraction can have considerably variability depending on many different things such as heart rate and volume status. Secondly, your functional status and comorbidities (diabetes, coronary artery disease, kidney function etc). are much more important in predicting outcomes.With that said, there are many people with heart failure who live long productive lives with little to no impairment in the activity of daily living. Good luck and hope that medical therapy will be successful in keeping you active and healthy.",
