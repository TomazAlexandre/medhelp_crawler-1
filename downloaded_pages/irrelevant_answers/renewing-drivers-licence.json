            "answer": "Hello kelvin,I am a volunteer here.\u00a0\u00a0My son who is 10-1/2 was diagnosed at age 3.To be honest, I am uncertain.\u00a0\u00a0I did hear something about having a doctor's notes stating that for the previous 6 months, the patient has been under good control.\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure if this applies to certain states or all.\u00a0\u00a0If a doctor is saying that someone has had their diabetes under good control, I would assume the doc would be looking at the hemoglobin A1C.I am sure you will have comments with helpful information.\u00a0\u00a0As I am sure you know, someone living with diabetes should ALWAYS test his/her BG before driving and of course, pull over immediately to the safest spot when feeling low.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had to deal with the driving bit yet since my son is 10-1/2, but my sister was dxd in early adulthood (at age 24).\u00a0\u00a0She is now 33 and so far, I have not heard from her that she has had to do anything or fill antyhing out and I am certain she has had to renew her license within the past 9 yrs.Sorry I could not give you a straight answer.Sincerely,SS",

            "answer": "SS gave you good advice.I'm also a volunteer and was dx'd as a teen.\u00a0\u00a0I'm now 50.I think the rules vary by state, as to what documents may be needed.\u00a0\u00a0In my state, I did need to have my endo fill out a form with her assessment on how safe it would be for me to drive, based on my medical history and my \"commitment\" to my self-care.That document went to a medical board that advises our motor vehicle bureaucrats -- not just for diabetics but for others with medical conditions.My most recent license was renewed for 8 years (the max allowed for anyone in my state).\u00a0\u00a0When I first moved here from another state about 15 yrs ago, I had to renew every 1-2 years.\u00a0\u00a0So, either their rules changed or their assessment of my stability changed.\u00a0\u00a0My health hadn't changed at all...SS point to check BG before driving is SOOO important.\u00a0\u00a0If he's self-aware enough to know when he's likely to have dropping BGs, even if his number is good at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0Lots to think about, but for many of us, testing before driving is as second nature as buckling our seat belts.\u00a0\u00a0Long drives, of course, required additional tests.",
