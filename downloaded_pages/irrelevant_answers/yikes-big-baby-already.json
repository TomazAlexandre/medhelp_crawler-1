            "answer": "First of all, congrats on the good news.\u00a0\u00a0That is always the most important.\u00a0\u00a0When I was pregnant with my daughter, I had my 35 week u/s and she weighed 7 lbs 6 oz.\u00a0\u00a0I freaked out because this is the size most babies are born at full term!\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I was never tested again for gest. diabetes, and I passed the first one at 24 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0They did test my daughter's sugar the day she was born but it was fine.\u00a0\u00a0I hear that is the procedure for babies over 8 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0Now, if 5 lbs 3 oz is accurate, and sometimes it might not be, you could expect a big baby.\u00a0\u00a0Addison was 9 lbs 3 oz at birth so they were pretty accurate with the u/s however, I was not induced.\u00a0\u00a0Just because a baby weighs a lot, doesn't mean that the lungs are ready yet.\u00a0\u00a0I did have to have a c-section because she wouldn't fit through my pelvis but whatever, she got here and she's very healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you and I hope that this info helps a bit.",

            "answer": "I was 30 weeks and my dd was almost 5 lbs. This was VERY good news for me- becuase I was in the hospital with preterm labor! I was induced at 36 weeks (and walking around at 7 cm for a month) and my dd was just 6 lbs 2 oz. WHEEW! I guess she just decided to put on weight differently ... but she would have still been a big baby if I went 4 more weeks!",

            "answer": "At 32 weeks and 2 days my baby girl was measuring 5 lbs 15 ozs. I was freaked out. They kept telling me what a big baby I was going to have. I had another u/s at37 week and that said she was approximately 9 lbs 12 oz!!!! I was scared sh**less!! Well my water broke 2 days later and I had my little girl. She weighed all of 7 lbs 6 ozs!! She was a good size for her gestation but nowhere near the size the u/s said. U/s's can be off by quit a bit. I wouldnt ask to be induced because of size. I know alot of woman who were told they were having big babies and were induced early with babies weighing only 6 lbs!!!\u00a0\u00a0I too passed my GD tests but the doctors were coninced I had it because of how large baby was and all the fluid I had. I had about double the amount you should have. I have 3 other boys and my water never broke with them, I would have preferred that with my little girl cause I soaked through everything! It was so uncomfortable to walk!! Opps, getting off track, lol! Good luck with your big, little or average daughter:-)",

I have my regular doctor's appointment today, so we'll see what he says and how my second glucose test goes (although I probably won't get the results from that today).I guess I should also add that I'm on blood thinners, so that can also play a role in me getting induced (since they need to make sure I have no blood thinners in my system by the time of delivery). But of course, the most important thing is that my little (or I guess I should say \"big\") baby is doing good!Thanks again!:-)",

Well we ended up c section at 38 weeks exactly and she was 7 lbs and 11oz : )\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0my pelvic bone angles downward and they really think she would have gotten stuck - also i was contracting every 2 minutes for hours very strongly the last 24 hours before our c section and no dilation and she wouldnt drop into my pelvis, they believe due to her size and my size.. they showed my husband a growth chart for babies at 38 weeks and she was in the upper 90 %tile! they said any bigger and they would be concerned (i didnt think she was THAT big for that age... but who knows!) i also didnt have GD... my dr said that the blood thinners help keep things open and the nutrients flowing to baby helping them grow even bigger! : )Cant wait for you to have your little miracle!!!! so excigted for you!",

            "answer": "So good to hear from you, bny! I just saw your new photo and your baby girl is sooo cute! Thanks for sharing your story, by the way, especially since we are/were kinda in the same situation...with big babies and both on blood thinners. That's interesting about the thinners possibly increasing the nutrients to the baby, though. Never heard that before, but it makes sense...just got back from my doctor's office and he said I'll be switching to heparin around 36 weeks and then we'll just have to wait and see how the baby's doing, but I think he preferred not to induce until 39 weeks, if necessary. So we'll just have to wait and see I guess ;-) I'll be going in for weekly growth ultrasounds until then, so they will be keeping a close eye on me and the baby!Oh, and I did do another glucose test...just in case I'm one of the few women who develop gestational diabetes towards the very end of the pregnancy. So we'll see what that reveals.:-)",

    "question": "I know bny posted about her baby girl being big a few weeks back (anyone heard from her after delivery, by the way?). Well, looks like I'm in the same boat. I'm \"only\" 32 1/2 weeks today, but my baby is already measuring 5 lbs, 3 oz.!!! I passed my gestational diabetes test \"with flying colors\" according to my obgyn, but that was a few weeks ago...so they now want me to do another glucose test next week, just in case.Just wondering if any of you have a big baby for your gestational age...and if so, will you be induced earlier than your due date? The specialist I saw today seems to think I will be, but I won't see my regular obgyn again until next week.(By the way, this was a follow-up appointment with a specilist after they found a cystic area on one of my baby's kindeys a few weeks back. Thankfully, though, both visits with him have shown healthy, normal kindeys! Yay!)",
