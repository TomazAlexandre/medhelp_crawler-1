            "answer": "ok this is a trap!!! you don't have normal sugars for a certain age and weight. Your ped endo is very kind. In a normal nondiabetic patient when we are considering criteria for diabetes we look to the latest ADA criteria.Criteria are as follows, fasting sugars should be under 126, sugars 2 hours after glucose load and mixed meal at times should be under 140, random sugars should all be under 200. If you drink a coke, no doubt we could get your sugar up there and it would be handled fine. Now also you may wake with a sugar of 65 and this be normal as well.Now in my kids with diabetes, I want their sugar to stay above 70 so they do not go low!I hope for bedtime sugars about 120 if they are little, so sugar norms are relative.",
