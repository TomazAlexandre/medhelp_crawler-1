            "answer": "Hello! DoctorThere was no change in the dosage of Diabetic medicine. Even yesterday while on her workout session she felt hypo and fell back home immediately. From the last two days she is not feeling well about her digestive system. Is there a possibility of Hepatitis even if she is careful regarding her foods? She cannot digest hard foods at all after she started her RIMSTAR. Lever function test after 2 weeks of 4FDC was ok. But I feel that after this week there might be some change in the LFT report. This week she has skin rashes and itching all over the body.RegardsTarek",
