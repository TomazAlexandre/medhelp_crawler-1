    "question": "My 3 yo has been potty trained for less than a year during the day and still in a pull-up at night (which has never been dry).\u00a0\u00a0She does not normally have wetting accidents, but over the past week or so she has been needing to urinate very frequently (every 30 min on average, but at times its every 10 minutes).\u00a0\u00a0She does not c/o pain and when she goes there is always volume (its not like when I have had UTIs and feel like I REALLY have to go and then nothing comes out).\u00a0\u00a0She has always been a big drinker as a matter of fact I cannot seem to keep her from finishing off everyone's drinks in sight (even when they don't belong to our family-when we're in public she just picks up cups and drinks if I don't catch her first!)The pull-up at night does not really concern me because her 5yo brother still wears a pull-up.\u00a0\u00a0Her 10 yo sister has thickened bladder wall and has been through lots of testing and biofeedback therapy in the last year, so if the little one is having similar issues I want to catch it early, but I just wonder if its something entirely different.Thanks for your advice!",
