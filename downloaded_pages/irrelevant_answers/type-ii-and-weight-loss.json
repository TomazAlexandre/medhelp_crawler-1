            "answer": "Hi,In terms of the lower numbers, those can be very normal if you feel fine. Healthy young women can have blood sugars in the 50's and be absolutely fine and healthy.\u00a0\u00a080-90's during the day are picture-perfect.In terms of the diabetes diagnosis, your 2 hour glucose test would have been useful for that, and it sounds like your doctor and nurse are trying to have it controlled with diet only--is that right? If your blood sugars are not going\u00a0\u00a0high after meals(above 140) then you may not need medication at this point.As you are aware, be sure to get enough calories as you are nursing. You may need to increase your carbs to do that--you need 500 extra calories per day for each child you nurse. If you have not met with a diabetes nutritionist, I strongly suggest doing that. They are absolutely wonderful when trying to control sugars with diet only.Take care.",

    "question": "7 months after having my second child I was dx'd with Type II. I am 36 yrs old and at 102 pounds today with a small frame. I had gestational and they all said it would go away that I don\u2019t fit the typical diabetic symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0No luck there. I took the 2 hour test again as a follow and low and behold I still have it. During the pregnancy I only got high readings if I was not careful well 7 months later I can go both ways now. Highs and lows. I am also nursing to complicated things. My doctor seems to not really care either way and I think I better search out a new one. I am not on any meds. My question is\u2026 what is too low? I have hit 59 without any symptoms. I am eating every 2 hours with 30 grams of carbs at each sitting. Suggestions?",
