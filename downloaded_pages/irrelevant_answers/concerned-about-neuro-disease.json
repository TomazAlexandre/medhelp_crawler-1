    "question": "Hi all. New to this forum. Ok so about 2 years ago I noticed that from time to time about a mile into my runs both of my feet would start to go numb and then parts of my shins. Other than that, when I wasn't running things were fine. I have always gotten normal numbness from sitting too long in one position or another though. Ok so finally this whole running this comes up in conversation with a few friends and they freak out and tell me to go to the doctor to get it checked out. Up until then I truly thought it was either plantar fasciitis that I have or bad circulation. So I've gone to the doctor about two weeks ago now and she ordered all the blood tests for vitamin deficiencies and thyroid/diabetes issues. All normal. Now she wants me to get an EMG first and if those results are abnormal, she will send me for an MRI. I'm wondering if anyone knows what exactly an EMG will tell me in regard to possible disease?Sidenote, I'm a bit of a hypochondriac and ever since I started googling symptoms and ms, I've become convinced that I have it and notice every little muscle twitch or time I drop something. I also worked out for the first time in a few weeks after having done it regularly for 4 months straight and got bad calf knots/cramps in the following days-this of course was also a freak out. Can someone please advise?",
