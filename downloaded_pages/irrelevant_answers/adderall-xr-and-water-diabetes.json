I am sorry to hear that you do not have medical insurance, and I hope that you will find a way to access medical care from someone who will help you with your problem.Best Wishes,Rebecca ResnikDisclaimer: The information in this post is for informational purposes only.

    "question": "So i have been taking adderal XR 20mg for about 2 years now, and i know a side effect is dry mouth.\u00a0\u00a0I therefore drink alot of fluids during the day, more than the usual person.\u00a0\u00a0I always need to have a drink with me or I become extremely uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been urinating alot, and sometimes to the point where I think i might not make it to the bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0at night i normally wake up at least twice. (normally the urine is clear or close to clear) I told my doctor about my urinating problem, and he basically dismissed me saying i was too young for a bladder issue, im 25.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway it has become a real problem in my life. So, I was doing research on bladder things and I read about nephrogenic diabetes insipidus.\u00a0\u00a0it can be caused in adults by a reaction to medication. I was wondering if this could be a side effect of the medicine? if so is there anything i can do to control it short of drinking less water?\u00a0\u00a0And is there any way to remedy the situation short of going to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have health insurance so it would be ideal if there was something i could do that does not involve doctors or prescriptions because both are quite expensive.\u00a0\u00a0I would extremely appreciate any advice on this issue.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
