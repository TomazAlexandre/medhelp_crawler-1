    "question": "I have been feeling very fatigue ATM, I know I have a physical job but have never felt physically tiered like this all the time. Since December 2013 at least once a week I have been experiencing hot sweats with dizziness, I find if I take some clothing off and sit/lie down after about 15mins - 30mis the symptoms pass but if I try and push myself to carry on with what I'm doing I then get ringing in the ears, blurred vision and eventually black out which has happened twice. I can't seem to find a pattern to when this happens as comes out of the blue. Does anyone know what this could be?",
