When you check your blood sugar on different meters it usually will never say the same thing. Dropping 76 points is a lot, but not real bad. I've had diabetes for 16 years and this is my second pregnancy and both times I was told to wait 2 hours after meals. Thats how long you should probably wait to. About the c-section thing yes only one person is allowed in the room.",

            "answer": "Hmm some strange things with that tester!\u00a0\u00a0Only possible effect I thought could change it dramatically like that is if you had a glass of water or something? Obviously the 1hr should read higher than the 2 hr but I would of been under the assumption that it would show a lot less than the difference from 140 to 120....I suppose it depends how quickly your body absorbs the foods.\u00a0\u00a0As for c-section I had my dh and mum in labour room but once c-section was in order i had to make the decision of which one could come with me...obviously i had no decision to make here, it would only ever of been dh to come with me if i could only have 1.\u00a0\u00a0that is Australian rules and regulations tho, I assume the same in the states.best of luckTrudy",

Here our blood sugar is measured differently and so a pregnant woman doesn't want her fasting over 5.2 and 1 hr after meals above 7 I think.Anyway, what I do know is that stress and anxiety could affect my blood sugar and change my reading withing 5-10 min. I remember taking my morning (fasting) while I was stressing out because my daughter was going to be late for school and wouldn't eat her breakfast, etc and my sugar would be high. I'd wait 5 or 10 min to retest after I calmed down and it was much lower. I asked the endocronologist and she said that stress is a contributor.Just a thought? I know your sugars have been upsetting you and I know that it helped me to know that.",

    "question": "Ok well you know I've been battling my blood sugar for a while now. Last week I was at the doctors and I checked my sugar on my machine a hr after I ate and it was 200. I told the nurses there while I was still waiting for my doctor. Well another hr later he wanted me to get checked in their lab so i did and my sugar was down to 55. I couldn't believe it. They checked it a second time within 7mins and it was 63 or so. At this point we all thought my machine was having issues, which I've previously thought before. So that night I called the company who makes my machine and they overnighted me a new one... which I just got today because of the holiday and stuff. So I just checked my sugar with this new machine(after I made sure it was calibrated) about a hr after I ate and it said 235.I still have my old machine here(haven't sent it back yet) and I wanted to see if it was truly messed up. So I checked it on there and it said 187. I figured ok yeah it's probably messed up. But I was just curious so I checked my sugar again with both machines for a 2nd time 5 mins later.New machine showed:159old machine showed:187 still.I'm confused. If my old machine is messed up which is possible I suppose then how in the world does my sugar drop 76 points in 5mins on my new machine????Oh and ill just put this in here too since its in my last post.... Just one person gets to come in when I have my c section right??",
