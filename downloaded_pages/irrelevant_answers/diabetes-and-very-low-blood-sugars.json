            "answer": "Hi. My husband had been on that same dosage for about 20 yrs and he started having lows more frequently, which caused me as much stress as him. He went to his endo with his problem and they changed his dosage to the 24 hr long acting, Lantus. He then takes a short acting when he eats. Things have been MUCH more stable sincen then. He has a little more flexibility with his eating times: not eating on time at lunch gave him lows and a crummy afternoon of work.Over the years he had his dosage adjusted here and there, but it really made a difference when he switched to the long acting insulin. I would definitley bring this up to your son's Endo.\u00a0\u00a0I hope things get better for him. That can't be fun to have those severe reactions at work, in front of your co-workers.Good luck, keep us posted on the results, it will be helpful to someone else down the line with the same problems. That's what this board is all about.Marcia",

            "answer": "I totally agree with the first two postings. The NPH insulin that was the norm years ago had some very dangerous spikes in activity that we always had to watch out for. I take the newer 24-hour Lantus and find that hypo episodes are much rarer now with this insulin. Some people also find that pumps offer good control with fewer dangerous lows also. The new endocrinologist may well want to change his routine to the newer insulins, and it is well worth investigating. Better control is easier to achieve and much easier on our lifestyles.",

            "answer": "one word. pump.and one question, why havent you gotten it earlier?I'm 25. your son's age. Working in a finance job. Find an endo that will encourage your son to go on pump therapy. I have a pump that has a sensor that warns before lows or highs ever happen.I just feel having lived with type I diabetes for 18 years living with anything but a pump is absurd, and any hesitations at going on one are easily proven to be misconceptions within a month of use.got any questions about it ill answer them.",

            "answer": "I am a 24 year old diabetic. I have had diabetes since i was eight. It gets so hard, but I have had the same problems as your son. I am looking into getting the insulin oump. The doctor's say after so many years, you become numb to symptoms that you used to feel (low blood sugars). The insulin pump can monitor your sugar for you at all times. It seems really worth looking into.",

    "question": "My 25 year old son has had type 1 diabetes since he was 2 years old. Over the years we have helped with his control. He is now working at a stressful job in finance in NYC and lives with his girlfriend. He is currently taking 2 shots a day of Humilin Reg. and NPH.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last six months he has bottomed out at least 8 times usually at lunch time and the paramedics\u00a0\u00a0have had to be called to his workplace. Yesterday when they arrived\u00a0\u00a0his Blood Sugar was 19.\u00a0\u00a0It seems he drops so quickly that he is unable to treat himself by eating a snack. He keeps himself healthy by eating well and is overall good shape. We have an appointment with a new endriconolgist in the city next week but wanted to be able to discuss options and concerns.",
