            "answer": "Hello,very sorry to hear about your uncle's condition, which sounds to be very serious, particularly the rapid deterioration in liver function and his loss of sensation in his feet.The best that can be done would be to get very strict with his blood sugar control (targeting blood sugar levels as close to normal as possible) to reduce the stress on the rest of his body.Work closely with his doctors to improve his condition.",

    "question": "Hi and thankyou for this site.My Uncle of 50 years of age, 12 months ago had some sort of boil or bite of some type on his big toe, which was infected and swollen to at least 5 x the normal foot size. He remained in bed ill for sometime until he was rushed to hospital.\u00a0\u00a0They said he was lucky to arrive when he did.\u00a0\u00a0Whilst he was in the hospital they attended his infected foot & also discovered a Testicle infection and also that he has type 2 Diabetes new to his Knowledege.\u00a0\u00a0The foot was apparently fixed & also they removed the Testicle & fixed that and put it back again over the coming weeks.\u00a0\u00a0With his new diabetes problem he now has two swollen feet and the one foot that was previously infected is bigger than the other. He can no longer feel either foot from the ankle down. 12 months ago when he went into the hospital thay also said that his liver was 60 percent & 12 months later they said its 20 percent now ?Is it possible to go from 60 percent to 20 percent reduction in Liver function in just 12 months ? & If so how dangerous can that be ?I do understand that all conditions depending on the person & thier history are different, but all the same would appreciate any feed back that \"may\" give us some insight.Thanking you kindly. wishing healing to all.",
