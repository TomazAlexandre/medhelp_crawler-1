            "answer": "I stared thru normal menopause at about 45. I had hot flases during the day, face would break out in a sweat; night sweats, would get wringing wet all over as soon as my head hit the pillow, and after going to sleep it would wake me. I would have to change pajamas, then I would feel chilled. Also the feeling of pins and needles all over. Since cancer and complete removal of all female parts. its back. I do notice if I eat something sweet it is worse. I would ask about bioidentical hormone replacement, I was brushed off when I asked, but now I wonder if the sythetic is not dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes.",

    "question": "4 months ago I had a total abdominal hysterectomy and both ovaries removed for a left benign and large right borderline mucinous tumour . 3 months post op my CA125 was at 5,. For the last few weeks I have been experiencing worsening electric shock type 'twanging' pains all over my body (including head, face, neck, arms, legs, pelvis - which have even woken me at night). Hot flashes, neck and back ache are also regular as is extreme and sudden fatigue. I am not taking any HRT/ERT.Could my symptoms all be related to low estrogen levels? I dont really want to go the hormone replacement route but am feeling so very very unwell after a very active life up until this point.",
