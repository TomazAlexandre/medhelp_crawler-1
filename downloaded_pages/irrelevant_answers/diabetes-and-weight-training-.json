            "answer": "BTW. I used to be a personal trainer. If you are weight training for 2 hours a day and concerned with diabetes, I'd change your split and do about 1 hour a day. After an hour of heavy weight training, your testosterone will lower, and cortisol will raise to give you energy. Cortisol screws with insulin, and raises glucose levels. So if you eat a revovery meal after with carbs, and that cortisol is still in your systems, it will spike blood sugar.",

    "question": "Hi forum experts, I'm a 30 years old Hispanic male (5'10'' - 203 lbs mesomorph) and Diabetes runs in my family on both sides of my family: both grandmothers developed diabetes in their 50s and all of my uncles on my mother's side (3 brothers out of 6 siblings)\u00a0\u00a0developed diabetes in their 40s. I get tested annually and my A1 level (about a yr and a half ago) was a 5.1 and my last 3 fasting tests (all within the last year) ranged from 89-98. I'm told thats normal. I've been seriously training with weights 5X a week for about 3 months and want to gain muscle mass. I haven't been able to increase my weight on my current caloric intake about 2900 - 3100--actually been losing weight. So I'm thinking about increasing my caloric intake to 3500 or, worse case scenario, 4000 to meet my goal. I keep my diet as clean as possible, including consuming foods in low GI--such as 3 cups of oatmeal a day. The problem is that these \"High Calorie\" diets require a crazy amount of Carbs per day. (like 300g minimum). Is it safe to consume this amount of carbs a day to fuel my 2 hour of weight training/day, five times a week? 2 months ago my CBC and CMP came back OK with only slightly high Tris. Thank You very much.",
