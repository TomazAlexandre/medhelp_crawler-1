            "answer": "Does your doctor test anything else but TSH? TSH is a pituitary test - and it tells the doctor what the pituitary is telling the thyroid, but it does not say what the thyroid is actually doing. Get a copy of your tests and see if there are any T4 T3 or ideally free T3, free T4 tests - if not, please get another opinion and more testing.Diabetes can be from diet but it can also be from other endocrine diseases - so I hope your doctor has checked for those.",

    "question": "I am a 47 year old female, type II diabetic, diagnosed with a nodule on the left side of my thyroid about 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0My physician wanted to remove it then but I insisted we observe it for a while before I agreed to surgery.\u00a0\u00a0It doubled in size over the next 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I had fine needle aspiration twice.\u00a0\u00a0The first was indeterminable and the second indicated the presence of oxyphilic cells.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH levels were normal but my antibodies were elevated.\u00a0\u00a0The decision was to remove the left side of my thyroid and have the 2 cm nodule tested.\u00a0\u00a0The nodule was found to be benign.\u00a0\u00a0It has been 4 months since the removal of the left half of my thyroid and suddenly I am having trouble swallowing, having dizzy spells, and acid reflux as well.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH levels were tested about 3 weeks after the surgery and levels were normal then.\u00a0\u00a0I had an appointment with my care physician a few days ago and she decided to order a thyroid ultrasound, a chest x-ray, TSH and antibody check, B12 check, H pylori check, and an A1C.\u00a0\u00a0I take only oral medication for blood sugar control and will admit my sugar levels are on the high side as well the last few weeks even with the meds.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously, I will wait for the test results but wondered if there was anything else I should ask to have checked and if another nodule is present, can I avoid more surgery?",
