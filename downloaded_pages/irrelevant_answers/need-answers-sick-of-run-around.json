    "question": "I am a 40 year old woman that also has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In may they found kidney stones.\u00a0\u00a0In June they put a stint in my urinary track.\u00a0\u00a0In July they did a lipotripsy on my kidney.\u00a0\u00a0Before they did they took an x-ray and found that my first stint had fallen.\u00a0\u00a0So durring the lipotripsy they replaced it.\u00a0\u00a0A few days later I ended up in the e.r. with severe pain.\u00a0\u00a0The next day I went to see my uroligist and made him remove the stint due to all the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Which in turn he dropped me as a patient.\u00a0\u00a0But since he has removed this\u00a0\u00a0I still have bouts with severe pain.\u00a0\u00a0I can no longer since his removal of the stint hold my urine at all. And have also kept an ongoing UTI.\u00a0\u00a0I went to e.r. again last night due to the pain.\u00a0\u00a0They ran a test on my urine and said that i have a severe UTI and that my white blood count is in the 400's in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0What would cause this?\u00a0\u00a0Is there a chance that when he took out the stint that he harmed me in some way.\u00a0\u00a0I never had any of these problems before the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Not to mention that since the time of them removing the stint.\u00a0\u00a0I urinate about every 15 minutes day and night.\u00a0\u00a0I have been going on about 2 hours worth of sleep a night since July.\u00a0\u00a0Please try to help with some answers",
