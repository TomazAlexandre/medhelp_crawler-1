            "answer": "Hi Sharon,as far as is currently known, diabetes is not a cause for Crohn's, which is an auto-immune system malfunction of the small intestine, and/or the large colon.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is quite different, in that it is caused by the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0Interestingly though, I was diagnosed with pancreatic insufficiency (not diabetes) last September when a CT scan showed an abnormality on the tail of my pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0I was prescribed Creon enzymes to take with each meal (and snacks) and was advised I will need them forever. I have had Crohn's for 40 yrs (dx when I was 25 yrs) and my doctors say the pancreatic insufficiency is a rare complication of Crohn's. Additionally my late mother was dx with type 2 diabetes when she was 59 yrs old.Go figure?I just don't know what to think, except I have an excellent gastroenterologist, who has recently become the lead gastro into a study on the costs/effectiveness of treatment as in-patient or out-patient, of the biologic drugs for Crohn's (Infliximab, Humira) which I started last July, so at least he is current with all new drugs. and....I trust him implicitly.Protein? I have always had to follow a high protein, high carb, low fibre diet, so I tend to eat very little red meat, but lots of fish, chicken and game. I occasionally have calves' liver, because I like it, and it has a lot of iron.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, I also eat good cheese (not cheap cheddar) but am staying clear of eggs at present as I think they may be the cause of my morning diarrhea, if I have one for breakfast. I don't eat any cereal or fibrous vegetables. I have seen many hospital nutritionists as I am frequently very underweight, but they really can't offer any more advice on what to eat than I am eating now.Let me know if you have any further questions and I will be happy to help if I can.Take care,Liz.",
