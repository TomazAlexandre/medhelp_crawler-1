            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You could be having anemia, dehydration, hypothyroidism, diabetes or electrolyte imbalance. In females it can also be due to polycystic ovary. It can also be due to subclinical UTI (not having any symptoms). Hence first consult your PCP to rule these out. If all this is ruled out then it can either be a sleep disorder or depression or anxiety.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
