            "answer": "It is possible to develop diabetes with long term steroid use but it takes longer than a few weeks to happen (lots longer).\u00a0\u00a0It is however, pretty much the norm to see blood sugar elevations in non-diabetics taking steroids.\u00a0\u00a0Some people receiving them while hospitalized may even need occasional insulin coverage.\u00a0\u00a0They return to normal when the steroid therapy is ended.\u00a0\u00a0(A little like gestational diabetes in pregnant women.)The thirst and increased water consumption (and increased urination that follow) are frequent side effects with steroid therapy even if the body can maintain a fairly level blood glucose level.\u00a0\u00a0You just have to be careful that the kidneys can handle the extra load and the body doesn't deplete itself of electrolytes.Depending on the dosage of the taper pack your son quit half-way through, his body could be struggling a bit to rebalance it's natural supply and demand from the adrenals.\u00a0\u00a0These glands seem to like it when steroid supplements send them on vacation and are sometimes slow to return to work.I'm sure you will continue your maternal watch and take your concern to the doctor if it doesn't resolve itself soon.Mary",

            "answer": "Is the Solu-Medrol the only med your son is on?\u00a0\u00a0I seem to remember he was recently diagnosed, but I can't remember if he is on any DMD's?I get dry mouth alot...and it definitely makes me drink more.\u00a0\u00a0But, I believe mine is a side effect of some of the drugs I am on.I also know that when my mom was taking very high doses of prednesone, every day, her sugar went up for a brief period of time.\u00a0\u00a0This went away soon after she quit the pred, just as her doctor said it would.Maybe your son can call his doctor office and just let them know what he is experiencing, as Mary states.\u00a0\u00a0Better to be safe than sorry...Glad to see you posting here, by the way.\u00a0\u00a0;0)Addi",

            "answer": "Thanks!At Mayo clinic they do 5 days IV solumedrol without tapering. This is their current procedure for MS. So tapering appears to be just additional overdose.Other doctors who are unaware of the new developments still do tapering.In the case with my son, the first neurologist in the hospital advised on 3 days IV. Then she was off. My son was up in 3 days. A second doctor showed up and seeing the improvement boosts the dose.\u00a0\u00a0No further improvements just side effects. I deeply regret that we agreed.",

    "question": "Hi all, I have a new question:2 weeks after the 5 days IV solumedrol + half tapper package (half because he stopped it), my son gets into periods of feeling very thirsty and drinking a lot of water.Is it possible that he is developing diabetes as a result of the steroid treatment?",
