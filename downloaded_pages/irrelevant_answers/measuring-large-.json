    "question": "hi ladies, I'm 25 weeks pregnant with my 4th child. I have been measuring within the normal range for fundal height this pregnancy. My last ob visit was when I was 18 weeks along, I had an ultrasound at 20 weeks and baby was measuring a week small but otherwise OK. However, I saw my midwife today and I'm measuring 7 weeks ahead all of a sudden. I haven't gained any weight. My cervix is way above my belly button! Anyways, ultrasound and gestational diabetes screening on Friday.. just wondering if anyone else has experienced this and what was the cause? Thanks in advance!!!",
