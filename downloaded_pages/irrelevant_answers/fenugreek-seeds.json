            "answer": "Hi,a blood sugar level of 250 after meals is already dangerous.Do you have a glucose meter?\u00a0\u00a0Do you want to try to control this with diet and exercise and weight control?If you do, you will need to make a 100% effort, and monitoring after meals (like you did during the pregnancy) to see if you are achieving your targets (i think you'd want to see 140 after meals).\u00a0\u00a0If you do this and your numbers don't start coming down quick smart, I'd want you to be getting a second opinion on management of this.Your doctor should have checked your HA1C.\u00a0\u00a0Can you request this too? What do your fasting blood sugars (am) look like?I disagree with your doctor who from what you have said hasn't taken this seriously.Your situation is way past taking some supplement or seed to cure it.\u00a0\u00a0You really need an all out focused effort and quite possibly you would need meds in the very near future if you can't get control of this through lifestyle measures.",

            "answer": "Fenugreek has a long history as both a culinary and medicinal herb in the ancient world. It was one of the spices the Egyptians used for embalming and the Greeks and Romans used it for cattle fodder (Greek hay). It's an herb used in cooking for its aromatic, not for blood sugar control.There are thousands of web sites propagandizing miracle cures for every known herb and cooking spice known to man. All they want is your hard earned money. If you're willing to give it to them, then do so. If you're smart you won't. If there was a natural herbal remedy for diabetes, I would be one of the front line advocates. There isn't one, hasn't been one, and hasn't been a human clinical trials with proven test results showing any evidence of one that controls or reverses diabetes ever.A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine[USA] showed that lifestyle change of a 7 percent weight loss through diet and proper nutrition and 30 minutes of exercise 5 days per week, resulted in a 58 percent decline. In order to obtain this you must practice self control and not eat sugary foods. Sweets \"At times\" or any time is bad. You need to stop, period.Doctors are human. Some graduate from the upper levels of their class while others stumble through medical school and graduate at or near the bottom of their class. Which one do you want looking over your health? A doctor who plays the wait and see game is not one I wish to look after my long term health. This tells me either they flat out don't know what to do or they don't care about me.Get an A1c test, get on medicine if needed, and change your lifestyle.",
