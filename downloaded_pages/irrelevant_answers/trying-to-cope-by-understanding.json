            "answer": "First, I want to tell you how very sorry I am for your loss. You must still be reeling in shock, and my heart goes out to you. I am not a doctor, but am a long-time type 1 myself. and am a mother. I feel for your pain. It appears from what you write that you did not know that your daughter was diabetic, and that this episode was a real surprise. Unfortunately, diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) is frequently mistaken for flu, and this is one reason why it is so dangerous. The reasonable thing to do when your child starts to vomit is to assume that he or she has a stomach virus. So the condition gets worse while the parents are waiting for the virus to run its course, not knowing that anything more serious is wrong. So I imagine that you are doubly shocked by how fast this all happened.While I am not a doctor, as I wrote already, I do know about DKA and I know that it is a real danger to all diabetics, particularly to children. And from what I have read about this problem, it presents itself differently in different people, and becomes deadly dangerous quicker for some than for others. Each person's response to the high glucose levels that cause DKA is different. We who live on insulin can attest to the fact that each one of us is different in how we react to insulin and to the foods we eat, too. That indivuality is one reason that diabetes is so hard to treat. No one dose of medication works for everyone, and when in trouble, no one set response to DKA will help everyone equally. I have just been corresponding with a young woman whose fiance thought he had the flu for several days just like your daughter, and then he went into a coma. He turned out to be an undiagnosed diabetic and when the young woman last wrote, he had been comatose for 14 days and kidneys were failing. So even strong young adults, who of course are sturdier than small children, can be in real trouble when DKA happens.Your question deals with what normal treatment procedures are. I am going to send you to a web site that discusses DKA at length. Remember that this article was written in 1996, so some things may be slghtly different now. But it will verify that DKA is a life-threatening condition in children and will give some of the symptoms you wrote about as signs of cerebral edema, the condition that is most likely to be fatal with DKA. The web site is:http://www.ispad.org/dka/dka-swe.htmAnother website, dated 1999, gives a less-detailed but simpler-to-understand synopsis of the problem, dangers, symptoms and treatment. This article is dated 2004, and it gives other links for more information beyond what the article offers:http://www.diabetes123.com/d_0n_031.htmPlease understant that this condition, once it progresses to cerebral edema, can be fatal even if the doctors do everything right.You probably are in need of support emotionally right now. I would like to send you to yet another web site in order to be matched one-on-one with another parent who can understand your grief and help you through it. These volunteers are members of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Center's Online Diabetes Support Team, and if you contact them through the JDRF website, they will match you up with a carefully-chosen member of the team to answer your questions one-on-one. The web site is www.jdrf.org. Once there, you click on the link that says \"New to Diabetes? You're Not Alone",

            "answer": "I can't begin to find any words to help you through this agony.\u00a0\u00a0Dehydration is one of the gravest dangers we diabetics face and may have contributed to your beloved daughter's death.I'm not a physician but from my own harrowing experience, IV fluids are important part of treating dehydration from illness, high blood sugars, food poisoning, etc.Losing a child is a horrific tragedy. Beyond the pain of loss, some families are torn apart by the collective inability to find strength or courage to go on.\u00a0\u00a0Guilt and second-guessing haunts sleep.\u00a0\u00a0\"Rational\" explanations about medical treatments are unlikely to ease any of the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Clergy and professional grief counselors can sometimes reach our hearts and souls to allow us to live in this world while our loved one is not with us.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that you & your family can find the right types of support to allow you to live, and to honor your daughter's spirit with your daily works.My personal thoughts & prayers are with you.",

    "question": "We lost our 8yr old Daughter on the 16th to type 1. She was sick for about 3 days(what we thought was a stomach virus going around). On Sat. 15th we called her doctor. he finally met us at his office around 6pm, he then sent us to the ER. They had me take her striaght to the ICU, where they started fluids at 99.9. She complained about her head severly hurting.(pain like I had never seen her in). She tensed up and started breathing rapidly. They ventilated her and call for the life flight team. They transported her to Childrens Hospital where the doctor there said there was little hope. After a CT and several hours of of intense prayers, we had to make the decision to pull the resporater. At 7am she was pronanced dead. As hard as this was to re-live this early, I NEED ANSWERS. Is this normal proceders.",
