            "answer": "Hi there,I agree with Flycaster that you can rule out heart disease as the cause for your chest pain.I would suggest that, if the pain persists, you should consult your PCP again and maybe ask for a referral to a Gastro Enterologist as you might have a Hiatal Hernia.\u00a0\u00a0You do not necessarily have to have acid reflux but keep a food diary and see if you have any symptoms from specific food.\u00a0\u00a0A Hernia would also mimic heart pains and the jaw and left arm could just be non specific.All the best and keep us updated, okay.",

    "question": "Hello, I'm a 35 year old female with chest pressure that goes into my jaw and left arm for the past 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I had an episode of chest pressure that lasted for about 36 hours.\u00a0\u00a0Went to the ER where they did the typical EKG, bloodwork, chest x ray and CT scan with contrast of my chest.\u00a0\u00a0Everything came back good and I was released to follow up with my PCP.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiac enzymes were perfect but my D Dimer was 5.2 which they said was very slightly elevated so that's why they the CT scan.\u00a0\u00a0I have had an echocardiogram and a stress echocardiogram done in the past 2 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Both were perfect.\u00a0\u00a0I weigh 139 lbs, 5'3 and I'm a light smoker.\u00a0\u00a0No family history, no HBP, cholesterol good and no diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0ER doc told me to start looking elsewhere for answers to my chest pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Can I be confident that this is not heart related?\u00a0\u00a0He said the risks of a cardiac cath are too great and I don't need one.",
