            "answer": "First 9 hours of sleeping without a dipper change is too long unless he's potty trained. Drinking water is really good since milk and juice can make him really thirsty. If you are so worry you should go to the Dr. to get a blood test since one of the symptoms of diabetes is thirst. Most likely he is fine. My son loves water and has been drinking bottles of water all day long since he was a baby.",

            "answer": "You are right to be concerned. Talk to your son's pediatrician right away. Especially since you say that his urine output is excessive. Your pediatrican will probably check for diabetes. Thirst and polyuria (excessive urine output) is one of the first signs of high blood sugar. There are metabolic and other disorders involving the kidneys that cause them to \"dump\" which means they arent working properly. Most of the time a child that young will not drink obsessively unless something is going on with his body. It may be something minor but you should take him to his pediatrician for some routine and simple tests.MM",
