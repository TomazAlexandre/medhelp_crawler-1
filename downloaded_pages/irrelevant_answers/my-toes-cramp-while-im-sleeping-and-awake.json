            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, muscle fatigue, pinched nerve due to wrong posture could be the cause. Change your posture and drink some fluids and see. Other than this it can be deep vein thrombosis. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle cramps and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "I've been trying to find out why my toes cramp while i'm sleeping. the pain wakes me up and keeps me from sleeping. They also cramp while i'm awake sitting down. If I'm walking or standing for a long period of time they will start to cramp while I have my shoes on. I tried eating the bananas and my doctor told me to take vitamin B. Nothing helps and it's off and on.",
