I believe, it started with mild and transient pulsation at inner urethra, for three or four days at random interval for few seconds. After three days I felt my legs to be some what heavy. and again after 3 days, I felt tightness in my feet. This tightness continues till date.\u00a0\u00a0I am doing Vajrasan(rock posture) every day after meals. I used to do it for 15 minutes. I have reduced it to 5 minutes on the advice of our member SOLACE.One orthopedics diagnosed it as Paras thesis. Pathology of the disorder is not known so no treatment is possible. analgesic does not work.Any other member suffered such a disorder? can it be because of long time(50) years' smoking. I have stopped smoking since last 7 years.This discussion is related to Dragged 30ft by a horse....",
