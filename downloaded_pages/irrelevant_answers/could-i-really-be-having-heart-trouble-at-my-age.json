            "answer": "I had to respond, not to scare you, but to let you know so you get this checked out.I am a 39 year old female with no risk factors(no high blood pressure, my cholesterol is low, no family history and I'm not diabetic) other than I am (was) a smoker. I had a heart attack a few months ago. I was then diagnosed with CAD. I am told it is quite rare for my sex and age (and lack of risk factors) for this to happen, but it does happen.Had I not listened to what my body told me and called 911, I may not be here today.\u00a0\u00a0Had I listened to my body even earlier (the previous day), I may have saved myself a heart attack.Take care and get yourself checked out.\u00a0\u00a0You have nothing to lose by doing this , but may have a lot to lose if you don't.Jann",

            "answer": "Hi NiklThe day before my heart attack I was washing and waxing my jeep and started having a lot of pressure in my chest that spread to my shoulders. It almost felt like having a lot of gas, but on a bigger scale, throughout my chest.\u00a0\u00a0Both my arms were numb and tingling (although I dismissed this as a pinched nerve in my neck from a car accident I had a few month previous).\u00a0\u00a0I felt sick to my stomach, although this only lasted about 5 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0I was short of breath and had trouble breathing when I lay down. My husband wanted to take me to the ER as I'm very seldom sick and he felt there was something seriously wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I convinced him that I was just over tired and out of shape and it would go away. I even tried tums, which I have never taken, but it didn't help at all.All of these symptoms were present the afternoon and evening(but the intensity varied). I went to a wedding reception that night and and tried to \"dance the gas out\".\u00a0\u00a0That was a bit of a mistake as it only made my symptoms worse.\u00a0\u00a0I went to bed with the symptoms, woke up in the morning with them(but the numbness in my arms was gone), but to a lessor extent.I stayed quiet most of the day and by that evening, while cleaning the kitchen, I could feel a squeezing between my breasts and in my throat.\u00a0\u00a0It almost felt like food was stuck all the way down from the base of my neck to my chest and inbetween my shoulder blades. Stupidly, I continued to ignore the symptoms and continued cleaning.\u00a0\u00a0The squeezing/choking feeling got worse over about 20 minutes and then all of a sudden it felt like there was an elephant on my chest and my left arm was numb.\u00a0\u00a0At that time I knew exactly what was happening and could no longer ignore the signs.I was told by the cardiologist that I was lucky the paramedics were called when they were and I got to the hospital okay.The ironic thing is that I used to work in a doctor's office.\u00a0\u00a0Although it was only a g.p.'s office and I didn't have a lot of background on heart conditions, if a patient had called me with the same symptoms, I would have directed them to immediately call 911. Looking back now the symptoms were very clear, but at the time, it was quite easy to dismiss all of them.\u00a0\u00a0I honestly thought that I was just having a panic/anxiety attack that I had heard people have as I had been under an extreme amount of stress the past 7 years.I'm just glad it is over and I can now go no with my life.\u00a0\u00a0But, if I can help one person recognize the symptoms and act on them before they have a heart attack, I will feel good.Take care, Joady",
