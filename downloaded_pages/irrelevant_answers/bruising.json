    "question": "Hi guys, I'm gonna start by saying I'm a bit of a hypochondriac so there could be nothing wrong with me at all, but my mother is very concerned and thinks I might have diabetes. So I'll try to give you as much detail on this array of possible symptoms.1. Mysterious brusing. I have a few bruises on me that I don't remember getting. They're not large, and not particularly painful, but seem to stick around a little longer than usual. I'm in school so it could just be that I'm walking into stuff and not remembering.2. Constant fatigue. This is the one that has my mother the most worried. No matter how long I sleep, I'm just constantly tired. I always feel like I could use a nap. I can't remember a time recently where I've felt really awake.3. Occasional blindness/head rushes. I have low blood pressure, and whenever I stand up too quickly I lose my vision for maybe 1 - 3 seconds. I don't think it's significant, but my mother does.Other things you might want to know about me are that I don't have a great diet (stereotypical American diet if you will), I'm 5'8 and weigh about 170 lbs, Caucasian, female, and not very active (the most activity I get is walking around at school and acting at play practice). I have before experienced unquenchable thirst but I feel this is more easily explained by the fact that for the first 12 hours of my day I go with only one drink, so when I get home I feel the need to drink alot.Thanks,Lisa",
