            "answer": "Hello Ladybug,It is common for our blood sugar to \"jump around,\" and yet we should strive to keep those jumps at much lower levels than we usually have at diagnosis.Our bodies are harmed by levels in the 200s, 300s and higher -- altho' at time we all experience those levels and can maybe even do some normal activities at those levels.Normal ranges are 70-120 and I'd encourage you, over the next few months to aim for \"jumps\" that are closer to those numbers.\u00a0\u00a0It takes a while for our bodies to adjust again to normal blood sugars, so don't be surprised if you don't feel \"too good\" right now at lower numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Your body will adjust (and you will avoid or delay many of the devastating complications diabetes can bring) in time to good numbers.Type 2 diabetes has a different source than Type 1 and there are more treatment options that may help you achieve good blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Just remember, that even tho' a diabetic might go for hours, days, weeks or months with 100% normal blood sugars (with a combination of diet, exercise, meds) -- that diabetic is STILL a diabetic -- unfortunately.Type 2s often face the challenge of being told, after many decades of certain ways of living, that they need to change their habits (foods, exercise, weight loss).\u00a0\u00a0That challenge is enormous for many, and so if you've been told to make changes, strive to make them in small, manageable steps -- so that you'll gradually be successful.\u00a0\u00a0Drastic changes can rarely be sustained for very long.This book comes highly recommended by my Type 2 pals (I have Type 1): The First Year Type 2 Diabetes: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed by Gretchen Becker.\u00a0\u00a0There is a lot to learn and this book can help you begin to build your knowledge.",
