            "answer": "Hangnails form when your nail cuticles become dry or rough.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not moisturizing your hands with lotion and they stay dry, this is the reason why you see them.\u00a0\u00a0The way to prevent hangnails is to: Clean/Trim your nails because this removes excess skin that could form into hangnails later on; Try not to bite your nails, because this can aggravate your nails and cause hangnails; Moisturize your hands, fingers, and nails throughout the day to keep your nails moisturized and strong; and try wearing gloves when doing things like housework because various cleaning agents can dry out your hands and cause hangnails to form and soaking them in water for too long can weaken them to cause hang nails; and finally when outside doing work like gardening, use gloves because it causes your hands to roughen and become dry, causing cuticles to crack and hangnails to develop.Goodluck",
