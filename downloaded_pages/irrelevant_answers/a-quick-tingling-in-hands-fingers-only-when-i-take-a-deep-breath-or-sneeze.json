My neck (and shoulders) ALWAYS have knots in them.....always thought it was from carring heavy babies, heavy purses and diaper bags.\u00a0\u00a0I have an Aunt with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 34 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0Not proud to admit but I am a closet smoker....I was always scared that had something to do with the tingling.\u00a0\u00a0However, the tingling occured too when I didn't touch cigerettes during my 2 pregnancies and breastfeeding.\u00a0\u00a0No consistant headaches....other than occasion sinus problems.I asked my doctor about this a long time ago and his guess was pockets of air(something like that???) near my spinal cord that will give me this tingling sensation???\u00a0\u00a0He called it something....don't remember.\u00a0\u00a0I really didn't understand but he said nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure if this is a big enough deal that I should get a second opinion.Have you heard of this?",
