            "answer": "Hi,I can only suggest a possibility. Feeling of tiredness and slowness suggests that you might have anemia. Anemia can be due to decreased red cell production. Decrease in red cell production would suggest that there is abnormality in RBC precursors or in bone marrow. To stimulate Bone marrow, there is hormone called erythropoietin produced in Kidney.Long standing hypertension and Diabetes can also cause kidneys to go weak and in turn cause anemia and easy fatigability.Hope this helps.Bye.",
