    "question": "My husband had bypass surgery (quadruple) about 5 years ago and has had leg pain every single day. Doctors kept telling him it would go away -- first they told him to wait a month, then two months....two years. He said he has seen a vein/artery specialist (from same hospital) but they don't know for sure what it is. They suggested surgery to maybe open it up more.\u00a0\u00a0He is not very open to any more surgery and does not want to have to go through any more surgery. Any advice would be appreciated. I should also tell you he has Type 2 diabetes (did not have this before surgery) and asthma.",
