            "answer": "Hello,There are some reasons for recurrent thrush infection. These include when symptoms may not be due to thrush, when thrush is caused by other strains of Candida spp. such as Candida glabrata( These may not be so easily treated with the usual anti-thrush medicines), you are taking antibiotics, or if you have undiagnosed or poorly controlled diabetes.You should get a fungal culture of vaginal discharge done and all these causes ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for your reply and for caring!I have had culture test done and it sent of for checks to the lab.My nurse has also had a look herself and both sources confirm there is only thrush present.I have in the past had mild episodes of psoriasis too, so my nurse blames it mostly on me just being 'full of yeast!'I'm halfway through my course of flucanazole and am neither worse nor better.. I'm just wondering if anyone knows whether that is normal? I still have 12 doses the go, over a period of 3 months.",

    "question": "Hi there, I have had my first ever yeast infection (thrush) since April 2012 and its not going away.Since April i have tried a one day tablet + cream, pessaries as well as the herbal treatments (yoghurt, garlic,etc).Since December my nurse has put me on a 6 month course whereby I take a Fluconazole 150 pill once a week. Im now halfway through this course and am seeing no improvements, how lomg does this treatment usually take to work?? And how effective is it?I am confident that what I have is thrush as an internal examination was done and that was all that was found. My symptoms are mild, mainly itching, no discharge. But after a year I just want to be healthy again!Thanks",
