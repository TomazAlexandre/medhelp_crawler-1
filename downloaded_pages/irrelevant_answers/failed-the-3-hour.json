Good luck!",

Anyway, right away when I get up, stick my finger...write down the #..eat breakfast...2 hours later, stick my finger...write it down...eat lunch and repeat until I go to bed! So, I got all my supplies and bought a cute little note book to write it all down! Yesterday was just a little scary with people giving me horror stories and what I google'd! And candy is my enemy so Easter should be a hoot! I was tempted to buy all sugar-free candy for the kids so I could have some! But I didn't...ha ha! Hope you all stay well with our precious babies! We are gonna make it ladies!!! Happy Easter!",

I have been watching what I eat, and have only caved on Easter (of course) and one other night I ate a piece of chocolate cake and that sent my sugar level up...but I had to do it! So, one day at a time and so far so good. I am a bit hungry because I am portion controlling to stay at 1800 calories! I see my doc on Thursday and he will discuss this GD with me some more. But I am surviving and even have dropped 3lbs since last Thursday! Not too bad!",

So I now have gestational diabetes and I don't think I like it. I just read up on it and it kinda scares me! They said it was not like they said oh my gosh, this girl needs insulin...but a trip to the dietitian and 1800 calorie diet. Hopefully I won't have to stick my finger and report my levels all the time. I am afraid of having such a large baby that I can't deliver him. I read that sometimes the babies shoulders have to be broken or nerve damage occurs while trying to deliver! I just can't imagine this happening to my baby! I have not gained an obscene amount of weight...22 or 23 lbs and I have 10 weeks to go. So I hope he is not suffering being so hugh that we are in danger! I am waiting for them to call me back and tell me what Doc wants me to do...and in the mean time, I am freaking out! :O( Cari",
