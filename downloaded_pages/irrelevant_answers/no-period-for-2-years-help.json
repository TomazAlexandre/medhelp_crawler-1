            "answer": "Having a few drinks with a girlfriend, I told her that I feel something is wrong with me and that my mood changes. She suggested I have a blood test and see if I could be going thru menopause. However I had a blood test to be told three days later I was borderline menopause. I have looked this word up on the internet and keep coming up with the words Osteoporosis and Heart Disease, Exercise up to 4 x plus a week. I am only a brand new 35 years old. Can anyone give me some more info. I have to go back in a month for another blood test. My last period was back in May 2006 and I have also had another child since then, but prior to having my baby I did not have a period. My baby was born in June 2007, so when I fell pregnant I did not have a period at all. I was taking and still am taking the mini pill prior to having my baby but there were times that I had forgotten it and hence I fell pregnant again. I have 4 children, 13 yrs, 9 yrs, a 2 yr old and a 9 mtn old. Things that are on my mind is Cancer, I am going to see if I can have a bone density test, and have another pap smear. Am I worrying too soon. Gosh please tell me I am not being a hypocondriac.",
