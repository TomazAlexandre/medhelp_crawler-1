            "answer": "Hi,You are right: diabetes can afect many organs and different body systems and many symptoms can be related to your diabetes. After having high blood sugars for a while, your stomach will not empty as well and regularly as it should. That can cause some irregular absorption of food and make it difficult to determine the best time for taking medication.1) In regard to your first question, it may take some trial and error to find the best oral medication for you, especially if your stomach ma not be working as well as it should. You should ask your doctor about doing a \"gastric emptying study\" to help determine if this is the problem or not.Do you check your blood sugar when you feel shaky? What values do you see? The values will determine what should be done with your medication, and this should be discussed with your doctor. Do not drive if you feel shaky, and always check your blood sugars before you drive anywhere.Some people feel shaky when it is low, but others feel it when sugars are high. Sometimes it is not related so the only way to know is by checking.2)The dizziness and heart racing may be due to your diabetes but it may also be from other things. Your doctor should examine you for signs of \"autonomic disregulation\" caused by diabetes, and if this is not the case, he/she should start looking for other causes.3)In addition to prescribing\u00a0\u00a0medications and ordering blood tests, your diabetes doctor should be able to review your blood glucose readings as well as discuss your diet and daily exercise routines etc to help determine the best treatment plan for you. He/she should also be able to give you answers to your questions and provide necessary information for you to make informed decisions about your care. They also need to do physical exams looking for signs of damage from diabetes.Hope this answers your questions. Feel free to ask more if you have them.Take care.",
