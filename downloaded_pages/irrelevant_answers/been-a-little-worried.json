            "answer": "The chance you have HIV from the exposure you describe is exceedingly low, i.e. zero for practical purposes.\u00a0\u00a0You do not describe any symptoms that suggest HIV.\u00a0\u00a0Having a single episode of herpes zoster (shingles) is not a marker for increased HIV risk.\u00a0\u00a0But perhaps your doctor did a blood test for HIV when you had the shingles; lots of docs do that routinely.\u00a0\u00a0If so and the test was negative, obviously you weren't infected during the stripper event.\u00a0\u00a0In regard to the more recent oral sex event, people don't get HIV by receiving oral sex, for practical purposes.If you haven't been tested, of course the answer to your anxieties is to do it now.\u00a0\u00a0You can expect a negative result. All in all, the odds you have HIV are exceedingly low, probably zero.\u00a0\u00a0(If positive, I would assume you have other exposures you failed to tell me about.\u00a0\u00a0It is simply the fact that people with your sort of sexual history almost never are found to have HIV, unless there are other exposures.)I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

    "question": "Hi doc, i've been reading the forum & it has been really helpful. Here's my situation.I am a 28 yr old male & I live in Canada & about 4 or 5 yrs ago I went to a strip club had a lap dance from a stripper, things got a little out of hand & there was a little unprotected vaginal pentration for about a minute (or even less than that) & i did not ejaculate. I came to my senses & stopped it right there.I've been worried about contracting HIV ever since, what worries me is that i've had a bought of Shingles in late 2004, which I heard can be a sign of HIV, my Dr. didn't seem to think it was really anything at the time he did blood work & things seemed ok about a yr later I got a rash on my upper right thigh which the Dr. gave me cream for & it went away, i've been feeling dizzy, tired, stomach pains, occasional diarrhea, thirsty, frequent urination, numbness in the hands sometimes. My Dr. seems to think I have diabetes which he is currently checking for, I also breakout in hives on my face & sometimes on my body from time to time but I seem to think it's due to stress & aniexty they usually go away in a couple of hours of getting them or when I calm down.I've been doing research on the net about HIV & have been getting worried sick that I have it. Does my situation warrant any concern? I've always been a worrier to begin with so some advice would put my mind at ease a little bit, I should also mention that I've had given unprotected oral sex with 1 other female since then, I know the risk is low on that but if you could tell me my odds of contracting it that way as well.",
