            "answer": "Testing for gestational diabetes (diabetes that occurs during pregnancy) is a normal routine for obstetricians, yes. However I'm finding, through research, that using a glucometer on a pregnant woman is far more accurate and less traumatic on her body. I think fasting while pregnant can be dangerous and not healthy. Also the GD test your wife just took isn't always accurate.If you feel comfortable going somewhere else then do. Don't feel you have to stay with someone just because you've been there for awhile. Go where you feel comfortable. We spend more time researching new cars and new houses but rarely spend that much time on where our baby will be born, which is ultimately more important than any material thing. I would suggest finding a midwife; they most likely will use the more accurate glucometer testing. It is normal for pregnant women to be slightly diabetic while pregnant without any harm to herself or her baby.",

            "answer": "yes.\u00a0\u00a0all pregnant women go through this test.\u00a0\u00a0I too felt horrible & thought I was going to pass out or puke.fortunately for me I passed the test.\u00a0\u00a0if the doc did a finger ***** after fasting... this can be not as accurate as the 4 hr test.\u00a0\u00a0the 4 hr test is a pain (literally making you sick) however, is more accurate.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't told how I could feel dizzy or sick by the doctors & nurses either.\u00a0\u00a0fortunately for me other women had warned me about this experience.gestational diabetes is not like regular diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She will prob not have to watch blood sugar or anything after the baby is born.Gestational diabetes can cause high birthweight babies... which isn't that problematic, but it is hard on the babies lungs & other organs & increases the baby's risk of diabetes after birth.",
