            "answer": "HI,I agree that sudeenly stopping your medication can be aq dangerous thing, so always discuss it with your doctor before doing so, please.There are many, many blood pressure medications on the market and they all have a different side effect profile. Chances are, with a little investigation and possibly trial and error, you will be able to find a medication(or two) that will control your BP without making you feel badly. So please talk to your doctor soon and restart the recommended medication as soon as possible. If your headache is severe, you have vision changes, chest pain, lightheadedness,weakness, confusion or other concerning symptoms, seek help at your nearest emergency facility.Take care",

            "answer": "1, don't ever stop taking blood pressure meds with out your DR knowing it. Your high BP can cause headaches. You should let your Dr know about the weakness. You don't want to have heart trouble and not get it checked. And you should get yourself back on your BP medicine. Read the side effets, because some BP med's cause a fatigue feeling, mine do, I just deal with it. But if it bothers u to much talk with your dr and he can try another on, Debbie",
