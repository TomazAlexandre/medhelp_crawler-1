            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Since you have pituitary tumor I would suggest you get yourself investigated for diabetes insipidus. Also diabetes mellitus is another cause for frequent urination. Get your blood sugar checked. Urge incontinence and small bladder are other possibilities that should be looked at.You need a comprehensive investigation by an urologist considering your medical history. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
