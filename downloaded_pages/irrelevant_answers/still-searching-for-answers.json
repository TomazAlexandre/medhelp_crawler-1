    "question": "Hi, I'll give you my story. Hi, firstly I want to give you my story then I hope I can pick all your brains???I have been feeling under the weather now for the past 3 months. It all started when I was out for a run, early morning, no breakfast, felt like I was going to pass out. Doctor thought it may be a case for Hypoglycaemia. So Blood tests were done and slightly low sugar level found. BP also fine.This is where my problems have started, feeling dizzy, faint, anxiety, depressed, worried, no energy, shaking.(Even although I have been to hospital to do all the main tests after I got myself in to a panic).All my life I have had to watch what I eat, persisting stomach pain, Indigestion. Dry mouth. Any sugar taken causes dizzy spells. Any bread also causes dry mouth sore stomach. I have been tested for diabetes numerous times but all normal.I have smoked for 5 years but now stopped, forced too if I\u2019m honest, due to the way I've been feeling over the last month.My GP has said it is a virus, and that I should rest and drink plenty. (I don't believe her)An old friend has suggested that I could be suffering from some sort of food allergy? Possible Yeast infection of some sort?Has anyone ever experienced anything similar????Any opinions ideas welcome?(Hope someone has an idea)",
