            "answer": "HiIt would be difficult to assess the cause of your nose bleed exactly without an examination; however you should find the following information useful.Nose bleeds associated with headaches might be due to a raised blood pressure, blood disorders or in injury to the head. A blow to the head may damage some blood vessels in the head region. Besides, migraines are \"vascular\" headaches, and medications might have something to do with your nosebleed..Do you have any history of raised cholesterol, raised BP, diabetes, cervical spondylosis or any other medical problems? Are you currently on any medications for migraine? I would advise that you should discuss this with your doctor right away as the bleeding in your case lasts for quite a long duration (5-20 minutes). He would advise a proper management and might consider changing some of your ongoing medication.Do write in if you need some other information.Take care!",

            "answer": "The problem is, I have not been taking medications other than birth control. The nosebleeds and headaches happened both before, during, and after I had birth control, so they appear to be independent of that factor, and I take no other medications.I have spoken to three different doctors about the problem, and out of all of it have only been able to procure a CT scan that indicates normal sinuses. Nothing else is tested. Most doctors are trying to view the symptoms as individual instances, but I truly believe that the headaches and nosebleeds are connected in some way.",

    "question": "Since last November I have had severe nosebleeds, always followed by a migraine or severe headaches. I have been to doctors and the only answer I've received thus far is \"I'm not sure.\" and \"Are you sure they're related?\"I often have migraines and severe headaches without a nosebleed, but I have yet to have a nosebleed without a headache. These episodes occur 1-5 times monthly and the nosebleed lasts 5-20 minutes followed by a headache lasting anywhere from 30 minutes to a full 24 hours.",
