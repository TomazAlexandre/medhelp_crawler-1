            "answer": "I am currently reading a book called Healthy Eating for Life for Women. It has multiple chapters dedicated to the female reproductive system. One part being on PCOS. I am 22, 185-190lbs and 5'1. I have problems in that area as well so please know you are not alone. I can go months without a period (right now it has been more then 3 months) though I am not pregnant. Infertility runs in my family (my mom was told she would never have children).The book I mentioned offers some sound advise on making our broken bodies better. I love me some meat to but I need to do what is best for my body. I did Atkins for a year and had great results. I lost 30 lbs in like 5 months but I then became sick (I was put on birth control for painful periods and to regulate them...long and behold I am allergic to something in them) and gained almost everything back. I tried to follow it again once I was feeling better but it just kills my stomach now. I've also tried low calorie diets but they usually lead to binges.As for finding better carbs...try farmers markets for fresh veggies and the frozen food isle for frozen veggies. I buy wholegrain pasta that cost about 50 cents more then the regular kind but I us less of it so it last longer. I mix in a lot of veggies with my pasta or rice so I still feel satisfied. My grocery bill hasn't really gone up much since making these changes (well except my bf loves his junk food lol).As for exercise start off small. Take a walk a few times a week and gradually add in some other exercises. I take walks a few times a week and when I cannot get out I jump on my elliptical machine (bought it on sale for half off!) for 15-30 minutes or do some yoga/stretching. I think my favorite exercise is planks though...you really feel them the next day hehe. Oh and switch your cokes for water...it helps with bloating and water retention.Keep your head up and remember you are beautiful no matter what size you are.Feel free to contact me if you like...a good support system is a great thing to have when you are trying to lose weight. You can also find the book on http://www.freebookspot.cc/ if you want to read it :)",

            "answer": "pcos hasn't \"doomed\" you to being over weight!!!\u00a0\u00a0You can lose the weight and keep it off and doing so will help many of the health issues you are having too :)\u00a0\u00a0I too have pcos and it's what I put in my mouth that is the issue, not my pcos as to why I gained far too much weight over the years.Has your obgyn discussed with you treating the pcos?\u00a0\u00a0Since you are young, they will probably start you on the bc pill as well as metformin.\u00a0\u00a0If money is an issue, be sure to ask what are your options for getting your medications cheaper too!\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes they like to try some of the newer and \"fancier\" bc pills for pcos but if you don't have insurance to make them affordable, be sure to let your provider know because even the run of the mill, fairly affordable bc pills will help with pcos - they stop ovulation which helps with most of the problems like irregular periods, hair growth and weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0 Because you have high blood pressure, you are at risk for complications from being on the bc pill. Your provider might prescribe an antihypertension medication to help control your high blood pressure.find a diet buddy! It can be a friend or a family member. Start walking! No need to set any land speed records with your stride either - just go out and meander because anything you do, is better than sitting on your butt on the couch at home :)\u00a0\u00a0Make yourself do it several days a week.It's not any cheaper to eat unhealthy than it is to eat healthy and in the long run, it's far more expensive to eat unhealthy!\u00a0\u00a0Start tracking calories -plenty of free online calorie counting tools out there. Be accountable for what you put into your mouth! Make food from scratch - always less fat , salt and preservatives than prepackaged food. You don't need to eat meat every meal either - you can get your protein from whole grains, eggs and dairy products.Best of luck - you can do this!grace",

    "question": "About a month ago, I was tentatively diagnosed with insulin resistance and PCOS, shortly after the loss of my pregnancy (blighted ovum). By tentatively, I mean I didn't do the bloodwork, but my OB/GYN said she was a sufferer of PCOS herself and she recognized my struggles, as well as the clusters of cysts on both of my ovaries.As you can imagine, this is difficult for someone who's just turned 18 less than two months ago. I hate my body and I feel like I was cursed to be fat and unhealthy for the rest of my life. I hate seeing thin people look at me like I've just eaten an entire box of donuts. I'm 5'4\" and approximately 180 pounds, and all my weight is between my chest and thighs. I desperately want to exercise, but due to my mostly sedimentary lifestyle in the past 10 years, I can barely walk across the street to the park without getting completely winded and having to sit down for a while just to breathe again. My blood pressure in a \"sitting\" position is normally 145/100.When it comes to my diet, I love meats (chicken, lean hamburger, etc.) and unprocessed cheese. I'm a big protein person. However, my family and I, as is most of the country, are going through a tough financial situation and we're living on whatever we can afford, which all happen to be things I shouldn't eat - macaroni and cheese, hamburger helper, mashed potatoes, and rice.How can I avoid the \"bad\" carbs when they're all I have, and how can I get active with my blood pressure the way it is? Can I reverse my PCOS by losing weight and be able to have children someday?",
