            "answer": "What form of dysmotility are you dealing with? There can be a variety of problems ranging from achalasia, spastic or diffuse esophageal spasms, to non-specific and secondary esophageal motility disorders (related to scleroderma, diabetes mellitus, and other conditions).Have you actually seen a person who deals exclusively with dymotility problems? Have you had motility testing? If not, you may want to consider it. Pinning down exactly what is going on may result in someone being able to tell what foods to eat and what form to eat them in. If this is a true dysmotility, you may not be able to get the muscles to move certain forms of food from the mouth to the stomach if the muscles themselves aren't correctly working.",

    "question": "A couple of years ago, I was diagnosed with Esophageal dismotility during an upper GI xray.It seems to be getting worse. I am having trouble getting my food to go down more often and sessions are lasting longer. I feel like I am choking, aspirating, and I bring up\u00a0\u00a0the food eventually. I am not vomiting. It just seems to stay in my esophagus. I spit up a lot of phlem to, it seems.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything I can do? Are there things I should not eat? I really need some help. My doctor hasn't beenany help. He doesn't seem concerned.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/232749\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/232749</a>.",
