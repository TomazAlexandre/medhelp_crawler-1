            "answer": "Hello,From what you are describing I'd say you are due for a checkup.You should be checked in particular for thyroid and diabetes.Thyroid basic testing should include TSH, FT3 and FT4.For diabetes, you should test HBA1C.\u00a0\u00a0You can buy a home kit to test the HBA1C at home.\u00a0\u00a0Truely normal results should be about 4.3 - 4.6. Although some say normal is still up to 5.5 or even 6, I would recommend seeing a Ddr. if your results were higher than 5.5.Are you overweight?\u00a0\u00a0Are you physically active?\u00a0\u00a0There are also lifestyle measures that can help to keep you healthy.",

    "question": "I have hypoglycemia and my blood sugar usually runs less than 100 after eating, but yesterday it spiked to 176. Should I be worried it turned into diabetes? I am 40 years old, don't have insurance & haven't seen a doctor for tests in about 6-8 years.I have been very thirsty, waking up to urinate 6-8 times during the night. I am very cold (live in Phoenix, Arizona) have been loosing weight even though I have been craving sugar from around noon until I fall asleep at night. Of course I have all of the hypoglycemia symptoms too, dizzy, shaky, confused, irritable, hungry, etc...I can't really afford to get tests from a doctor unless I know I really, really need to!\u00a0\u00a0Please help me and if you have any resources on cheap or free clinics for diabetes in AZ that would be great too!Thanks & have a blessed day,Faith",
