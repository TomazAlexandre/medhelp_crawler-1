    "question": "I have COPD with Asthma and also Diabetes, Sleep Apnea, and Multiple Sclerosis. I am currently on 6L of O2 24/7. I use a BIPAP at night, and several times during the day when napping. I use a walker most times in the house and occasionally use my power chair too. My oxygen drops from 92 while sitting to 80 when standing up. I am having extreme difficulty staying in a standing position and trying to move about the house. When in the kitchen I have to hang on and lean on the counter top to keep standing...while I try to cook, and prepare my meals. I don't know what to do that will enable me to stay upright and get anything done. My pulmo doc says it''s the MS, my neuro says it' the copd, I don't care what it is,I just want to be able to function better. Oh, I also have an immune defiency and get IV IGg treatments via a port every three weeks. The treatments are about in excess of 4,000 a month and still I can't stand up for very long. What should I do?? Thank you in advance",
