    "question": "I am posting this because I am becoming increasingly worried about my boyfriend. If anyone could give me any ideas from the following, and if I should be as worried as I am and what to do about it, that'd be great!He's 21 years old, in good health and quite fit.Been really tired for the past month, however, the past week and a half it's gotten increasingly worse. He can sleep for 20+ hours a day and still feel like he hasn't slept at all. All he wants to do is sleep.He has become increasingly thirsty, that is never fully quenched.He has had a decrease in his appetite.He has a drastically decreased sex-drive.When he wakes up, it takes a good 5-10 minutes for him to be able to focus his eyesHe also mentioned feeling \"not normal\" but couldn't figure out how to explain it.I'm trying to convince him to go see a doctor but it's a long process because he's refusing to admit that anything is wrong. Does anyone have any ideas??",
