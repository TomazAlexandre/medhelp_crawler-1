            "answer": "Hi.What are the symptoms that you have been experiencing? How long have you been experiencing them? What part of the brain did the MRI report say the white spots were found?The \"white spots\" that you saw are probably white matter lesions. Fibromyalgia is usually not associated with this finding on MRI. It is more commonly associated with diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cerebrovascular disease/ischemia, diabetes, hypertension, diabetes, coagulopathies, hyperlipidemia. vasculitis, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, Lyme's disease, migraine, and aging.At this point, you shouldn't be concerned as there is no certainty that the white matter lesions are indeed caused by a serious condition. You should talk to your neurologist about this.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi,What major surgeries have you undergone?What symptoms do you currently have?White spots in the brain on MRI can just be an incidental finding without any significance (20-30% cases) or can be due to multiple sclerosis, severe migraines, sometimes it is a sign of cerebrovascular disease like stroke. White spots seen on MRI are infact damaged or injured brain tissue.It is very important to know what your symptoms are before making any conclusion.Hope this was helpful!",

            "answer": "Hi,I would also suggest you to get your blood pressure checked to rule out hypertension as a cause of your headache and dizzy spells.I would say it is quite possible that the white spots in your brain MRI are incidental findings.Please relax and continue doing whatever you are doing as you are handling everything very well.",

            "answer": "Hi.It is always better to be evaluated in person by a neurologist to ease your anxiety about the MRI findings. The consult could also possibly be helpful in determining the cause of your headaches and dizziness.An evaluation of your spine by the neurologist would also be needed to assess the current status of the bulging discs as well as provide a management plan for this condition.Good luck.",
