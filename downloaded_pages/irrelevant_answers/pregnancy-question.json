            "answer": "Hi triplerocks,I'm not a doctor, just the mother of a diabetic teenager, but I can say that yes, pregnancy is different for diabetics. If you are pregnant, you will need careful monitoring and medical care. It's pretty easy to find out quickly if you're pregnant or not, with a home test you can get at any pharmacy. If you test positive, I would advise getting in to see your doctor ASAP. It would be wise to consult an endocrinologist as well as your regular OB/GYN, because as I said, you will need to work on tight blood-sugar control during the pregnancy.Good luck!",

            "answer": "I agree with all the others who have posted here that tight control is very important. Many doctors want their pregnant diabetic patients to maintain an a1c of 6 or even lower both before and during pregnancy in order to protect the growing and developing baby. This kind of very tight control is especially important the first few weeks while the main development of the baby is happening, and also at the end of the pregnancy in order to keep the placenta healthy enough to continue to nourish the baby at the end of the 9 months. So, IF you have to wait, take charge of those glucose numbers in the meantime in order to prevent damage to the baby.If your glucose levels are kept as normal as possible, the odds of having a very healthy baby are about the same as for the general population, but women whose glucose levels run high do have greater\u00a0\u00a0odds of having a baby with birth defects. So do take control now, if you already haven't. I would recommend that you test every 3 hours or so and adjust to the numbers you see so that the numbers stay between that normal range of 70-126 most of the time. We wish you the very best. Many women write in to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation when pregnant and tell us later that their control was the best it has ever been while they were pregnant.",
