    "question": "I am 59 and a very strange thing happened this morning. At 5:00 am I woke up with a terrible pain in the left side of my chest.It radiated down my arm and down my belly. My arm has been hurting all day from that. At 4 pm it happened again. I am ok now but I feel like a burning in my chest and my arm feels so week.I don't have the energy to go to the ER. I am calling my doctor in the morning. My back is hurting too. Any suggestions? I am normal weight but I do have diabetes and on oral drugs. Am I o.k.? My dad died from heart at 70.
