    "question": "Hi guys,I have a concern and I would like your educated opinions. I was on a bus seat and noticed the guy standing next to my seat bleeding from his nose . I had just left after having blood drawn for cholestrol and diabetes. The nurse tried several times and as a result I ended up with several pokes. As I got on the bus, I guess the cotton fell off and my little needle pokes were still oozing a bit. I wasn't aware of it until I saw the other passengers blood landing on my arm.Please advice me if this is serious and is a risk. I wiped it off but his blood still landed in my open pokesThank you",
