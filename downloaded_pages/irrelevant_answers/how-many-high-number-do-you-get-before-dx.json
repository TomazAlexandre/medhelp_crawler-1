            "answer": "Many PCPs don't know very much about diabetes, and your doctor sounds very much in the dark. You need to get an accurate diagnosis and then a plan for treating your diabetes. Diagnosis is not based on number of highs. Diagnosis used to be based on fasting blood sugar or OGTT. Any ONE fasting blood sugar 126 or higher qualifies for a diagnosis of diabetes. 100 to 125 is pre-diabetes. The current mode of diagnosis is considered to be the A1C which is an average of blood sugars for 2-3 months. Anything from 5.7 to 6.4 is pre-diabetes and 6.5 and over is diabetes. End of story. Non-diabetics rarely go over 120 after eating. Any prolonged blood sugars over 140 can lead to diabetic complications. I would see a qualified doctor or an endo and get diagnosed. Then you can begin to work on your diabetes with a combination of\u00a0\u00a0weight loss if you are overweight, cutting carbs and getting regular exercise. Diabetes is a manageable disease.",
