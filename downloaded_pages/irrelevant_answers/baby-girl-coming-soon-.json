I also forgot to mention in my post that she's been a stubborn baby and refuses to go head down haha. Already stubborn like her mommy and daddy. Shes got 2 weeks to turn so we may not even need the c section. So pray the little bug turns in time!!!",

    "question": "Not really a question. But just wanted to say we have a c section scheduled. So instead of baby coming Oct 10, she'll be coming Oct 1. As much as I didn't want a c section, I'm actually a little relieved she'll be coming sooner rather than later. Having gestational diabetes *****! But anything to make sure baby girl makes a healthy appearance. These last few weeks of pregnancy have been a little miserable to say the least. Esp with still working full time as a RN and night shift. Ugh haha. Def going to get a doctor's note to leave earlier so I can relax and mentally prepare myself for these next couple weeks lol.",
