    "question": "My mother recently started feeling sick. She has a horrible pain in her lower left abdomen. Then she started acting 'drugged'.I thought it was a stroke or something, so I took her to the emergency room. They said it was diverticulitis, and put her on TONS of antibiotics. 6 days later... She still goes in and out of acting 'drugged', and the weirdest part is her fever. It fluctuates between 97.9 & 101 back and forth often 15 minutes at a time. Back and forth rapidly and repeatedly. Doctors have no idea what's up....... Any ideas? ????",
