            "answer": "Your thyroid tests look good, but you should ask your doctor for a Free T3 test, as symptoms, typically, correlate best with Free T3, since Free T3 is the active hormone that's used by every cell in your body.Have you had vitamin B-12 tested?\u00a0\u00a0Deficiency can cause the most horrendous fatigue imaginable.What about blood sugar levels/insulin resistance, which is the inability to process sugar properly?\u00a0\u00a0Insulin resistance can cause sudden weight gain also... Have your doctor test Fasting insulin levels, as well as hemoglobin A1c to get an idea of what your blood sugar levels have been doing over the past 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0It's possible you have either pre-diabetes or type II diabetes.Do you know what your cholesterol levels are?\u00a0\u00a0There is a condition called metabolic syndrome that's a cluster of symptoms including insulin resistance, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, large waiste, etc that can cause weight gain/inability to lose.\u00a0\u00a0I have it and I've managed to reverse mine.",

    "question": "Hi All,Can someone help me out with what \"decreased vascularity\" means in regards to the thyroid? I've had normal blood tests and two ultrasounds done in the past 3 months after seeing my GP and ENDO in regards to feeling ill, exhausted and having abnormal weight gain. It seems as though my cysts are nothing to be concerned about, I just don't understand the diminished/decreased vascularity bit.Here are the results of my most current US:FINDINGS: The right lobe of the thyroid gland measures 4.5 x 1.4 x1.0 cm. Vascularity appears to be diminished. Echotexture is normal.There is a 0.9 x 0.7 by 0.7 cm cyst in the lower pole of the gland.There are no microcalcifications. The margins are well-defined. Thereis no blood flow.The left lobe of the gland measures 4.4 x 1.3 x 1.6 cm also decreasedin vascularity but normal in echotexture. 2 small colloid cysts of0.8 cm and 0.7 cm are noted.IMPRESSION: Colloid cysts on left lobe. Simple cyst right lobe ofthe thyroid gland. Overall appearance grossly unchanged.Echotexture normal. Decreased vascularity.Thank you in advance!",
