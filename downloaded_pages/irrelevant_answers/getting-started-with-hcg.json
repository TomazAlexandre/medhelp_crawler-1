            "answer": "I don't know about the drops, I have never used them, but the injections work well. I get mine from my husband so have not had to order on line. However, he does take cases from out of state and does a health history with everyone before prescribing. When he sends out the hcg, he includes the supplies and the diet plan - everything you need to get started. If you are interested, you can look him up by my user name gotnd.Otherwise, you can find the diet plan in many places online if you type in \"pounds and inches, DR ATW Simeons\" in the search engine. That is the original diet discovered back in the 50's or 60's. Most of what you do on this diet is completely done at home so you should be able to order online and do fine. The exception to this, I think, is if you have health concerns such as diabetes or cancer, in which case, you should DEFINITELY be under the supervision of a physician. If you are going to order online, be sure of the source(Where is it from, what are the testing and purifications that it goes through, are there any fillers), make sure it is actually human derived, and know that it really is a prescription item here in the US - if they tell you that you don't need a prescription, I wouldn't buy from them.",
