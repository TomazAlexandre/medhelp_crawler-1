            "answer": "Hi, I am type two also. A diet that is good is A lowcarb one, Atkins diabetic rev. or any others, South beach, Low glycemic. But u said u lost 40lbs and all your blood work is in good shape so what is the question? U did something very right in your diet. I know the Dr. on here says get the white starchy foods out of your diet, and the junk and processed foods,Good foods are, fruits,No-starchy veggie, high fiber grains and proteins, dairy that is low in sugar.",

            "answer": "To rootietootie and strawberri--Thank you both for your kind responses.I apologize for burying my question deep inside my rant.I need to know--Is there any difference in the degree of dietary restriction for non insulin diabetics and those that use insulin?I get the impression that those who must rely on drugs and\u00a0\u00a0diet alone must be even more careful not to overburden their permanently damaged organ functions....Also,what are your opinions on the glycemic index/glycemic load debate?Those in the ''index' camp feel that it should be the primary tool in determining what's safe to eat.Those in the ' load' camp feel that 'index' is ****.Others,including my own doctor,think its all ****.Jeez.What do I do--flip a three-sided coin? Thanx again",

            "answer": "*I* feel your pain, frets, because it *is* frustrating trying to sort through all the conflicting info.As regards insulin, I actually had a doc tell me that if I got tired of controlling my diet she could prescribe me insulin and then I could eat what I want if I learned how to adjust the insulin doses. I was furious and got a new doc... I want to *avoid* taking insulin, and really avoid taking any meds if I can safely do so by controlling my diet and lifestyle.Anyway, the others who posted are right... the most important thing is that you *are* doing the right things and you have your \"stats\" under good control.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is different for each of us; some have to avoid all sugars to keep good bs control, others are ok with a moderate carb intake, etc etc...\u00a0\u00a0the best thing you can do for yourself is literally monitor what you eat and how it effects your blood sugar, then you can know what works well for your body and what doesn't.As a general rule, lower carb foods, high fiber, and limiting unhealthy foods (snack foods, sweets, alcohol), and maintaining a good weight, moderate exercise, and keeping as happy an outlook on life as you can muster are all a good start.... I also think a frustrated rant is healthy now and again too.\u00a0\u00a0;-)",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes about 10 months ago.My doctor's instructions-Metformin twice a day,strict diet and exercise for weight loss,& use the internet to gain as much information on the disease as possible.I lost 45 lbs,A1c is now 6.3,& blood sugar and pressure levels are well within commonly acknowleged safe ranges.I am frankly angry and frustrated over the blatent lack of consensus and contradictory info on safe diabetic nutrition from these sources,all authored (it seems)by self-proclaimed 'expert' dieticians and ADA card carrying MD's.In particular-The info is directed at insulin dependent diabetics,rather than those,such as myself, who need to know specifically what differences(if any) in food intake we need to follow in order to avoid going on insulin.As a low income person without health insurance,the prospect of simply having to become a human pin cushion is unpleasant enough.But having to pay $4000 to $5000 a year out-of-pocket for insulin,testing strips,syringes,constant blood tests etc would leave me homeless--effectively,a death sentence. Any insight would be greatly appreciated. Thanks",
