            "answer": "I'm very puzzled by what you write. To my understanding insulin resistance can exist as a precursor to type 2 diabetes, and I would guess your doctor is trying to head off the diabetes. But you are on the maximum dosage of metformin for somebody WITH diabetes. You are saying your blood sugar is not at all high? Did he do an A1C test and if so what is the results? I'm sorry but I don't know too much about insulin resistance except how it works in type 2 diabetes, but I have never heard of someone taking that much metformin who is not diabetic. If I were you I would read up on insulin resistance, and I would make an appointment to see an endocrinologist. There is something wrong with this picture imho: 1. Why he is treating insulin resistance without diabetes so aggressively and 2. If you were that insulin resistant you wouldn't have been able to lose weight so easily that the doctor commented it was too fast.I would make sure the doctor explains to you what he is treating and why. I would absolutely want clarification (by A1C test) as to whether you have diabetes.",

            "answer": "Yes, there is a test for diabetes called the A1C which checks the average blood sugar for a period of 2-3 months. This is the criteria for diagnosis of diabetes, not a random blood sugar.As if you aren't confused enough, I have something else to throw into the mix. If you are diagnosed with diabetes you will need to ascertain your type. Your doctor seems very fixed on insulin resistance which means he thinks you are at risk (if you don't already have) type 2. I wouldn't be that sure. Up to 20% of Type 2's are misdiagnosed just based on their age, when they are in fact Type 1s or LADAs which is a form of type 1 with a more gradual onset.You mentioned two things that make me think of that which are that you have thyroid disease and that you lost a lot of weight easily. I'm glad you are being referred to an endo; they will be able to sort all this out.",

            "answer": "OK, here is what I found out.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said she tested my insulin serum level.\u00a0\u00a0The range is 0.0-24 and my levels have been 21, 15, 19, 17 with the last 2 being on 2000mg of metformin.\u00a0\u00a0I have only seen 2 glucose levels and they were 89 and 91 fasting.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said most endos like the serum insulin level to be below 13.\u00a0\u00a0She says she feels I am insulin resistant.\u00a0\u00a0She said I should get the Insulin Restistant Diet book and follow it exactly for one month and see what happens.\u00a0\u00a0If I am able to lose weight and the numbers drop then that confirms the IR.\u00a0\u00a0She said I was able to lose weight rapidly on the low carb diet because that is the best way for IR people to lose.\u00a0\u00a0She says I am having trouble losing now due to not following the diet exactly and some of my thyroid issues.\u00a0\u00a0She is reffering me to an endo for both problems but she said it will take a while to get in to this endo because she is really good.Some now my questions are if I follow this diet and my numbers do drop then will I feel side effects from too much meds?\u00a0\u00a0Also she told me that the pituitary is getting a message from the insulin or fat telling it to crave carbs and the process cycles.\u00a0\u00a0She had also told me one of my thyroid numbers is pituitary realted.\u00a0\u00a0Could all this be from a malfunctioning pituitary?Thanks for all the help!",

            "answer": "Sounds like you had a good visit and got a lot of information and guidance. I'm sorry but the pituitary issues are totally out of my knowledge base.As for the side effects from metformin, they are generally at their strongest when you first start taking them and are of a gastrointestinal nature. The only concern would be if the diet combined with the metformin brings your numbers down too well and you have hypoglycemia. I would just monitor this by testing at home and seeing how your numbers are. If you test two hours after a meal now and then this will also give you more information about your blood sugar until the endo is able to do the A1C. I'm glad the doctor is recommending low carb diet, as so many doctors are still stuck on low fat. Let us know how it goes and what happens when you see the endo.",

    "question": "Several months ago during some routine testing the doctor said my insulin level was too high.\u00a0\u00a0On the report it did not show outside the normal but she said the usually accepted cut off for insulin resistance was lower than my level.\u00a0\u00a0I was placed on 500mg metformin, told to cut out process/refined sugar, carbs, and be re-tested.\u00a0\u00a0This process has continued and now I am on 2000 mg of metformin and my levels are actually higher.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been perfect with the diet but certainly much better than before.\u00a0\u00a0I actually had recently lost 50 lbs on a high protien diet before I had the initial tests run.\u00a0\u00a0My weight loss physician had told me I was losing the weight kind of fast and I needed to gradually bring back in good carbs.\u00a0\u00a0So I started that, maintained the weight loss for 3 years and now am told I am insulin resistant.So now I am trying to increase my exercise and back off any carbs as much as possible.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my questions are1.\u00a0\u00a0what are the \"numbers\" I am looking at?\u00a0\u00a0My glucose was not high on the tests but she said my insulin was.\u00a0\u00a0She kept mentioning number sin the teens, like she said 14 was a cut off and I am at like 15, then 21, then 19...2.\u00a0\u00a0what am I supposed to be eating?\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid to eat anything.3.\u00a0\u00a0Why would the metformin not be working?Any help would be great!!",
