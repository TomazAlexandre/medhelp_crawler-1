            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to dermatitis skin, contact dermatitis or parasthesia skin. Avoid using any lotions and creams over the face for the meantime. Wash your face with a mild cleanser with moisturizing properties like Cetaphil. Pat your face dry. Then apply a good hypoallergenic moisturizer over the area and see if this improves.If the symptoms still persist then you can apply mild steroid like dermacort.If the irritation persists then get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hello,For such symptoms parasthesia skin needs to be ruled out. The other possibility is of neurodermatitis. Parasthesia are common in metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Also get neurodermatitis ruled out from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Over the last few weeks I have been experiencing a burning and itching sensation on the skin on one shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0I don't seem to have a rash, or sunburn, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The feeling is not constant, but will flare up for a few minutes at a time and then disappear for several hours.\u00a0\u00a0I am not on any medication nor do I put on lotion, etc., so I doubt that it is an allergic reaction.Any idea as to what might be causing this would be appreciated.Thanks a lot.",
