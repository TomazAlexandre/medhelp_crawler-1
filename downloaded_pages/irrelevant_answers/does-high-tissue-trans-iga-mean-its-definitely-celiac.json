            "answer": "High transglutaminse levels can be found in other conditions, so I believe your doc may want to do some more testing. However, if your son has other symptoms suggestive of celiac issues, you may want to call the doc's office and find out if he could start a gluten-free diet now instead of waiting. If the doc wants to do more testing, your son will need to stay on gluten to verify the presence of celiac or other until the testing is done.",

            "answer": "It is my understanding that high transglutaminase levels can also be found in those with celiac disease, juvenile diabetes, in inflammatory bowel disease and in various forms of arthritis.You might want to ask your doc about checking his genes and to see if your son is producing high levels of IgA-gliadin.Some docs feel only the presence of a problematic biopsy with flattened villi and elevated levels of IELs (intraepithelial lymphocytes) are diagnositic. However, it's now being suggested that high transglutaminase, the presence of celiac genes and elevated levels of IgA-gliadin are diagnositic.",
