            "answer": "Hi, Many thanks for your question to the forum. Most likely your symptoms could be due to injury to a nerve, pressure on spinal or peripheral nerves (neuropathy), vitamin deficiency, lack of blood supply due to cholesterol plaque from atherosclerosis in the extremities, viral infection, hormonal imbalance and use of certain medications.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, atherosclerosis can also cause pain, numbness, and tingling while walking and they can also reduce blood supply and lead to numbness. Please consult your doctor to get all these possibilities evaluation in your case for further assessment. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "A huge drop in blood pressure on standing is a symptom of adrenal fatigue. I think you should ask for specific thyroid and adrenal function tests. Take B- vitamins, plus extra B5 and vit.C. Have a metabolic panel done too. Drink electrolyte beverages, and don't avoid salt.Hopefully, it's not dysautonomia, though it could be. I believe there is a knowledgeable specialist for this in Florida, which your bio says you're from?",

    "question": "I am 19 years old and have been dealing with troubling symptoms for 2 years and no doctor has been able to give me an answer.\u00a0\u00a0Most every time I stand up I get really lightheaded and for a few seconds my temples feel like it's burning and my vision kind of gets splotchy with bright spots.\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally a headache will accompany it, but usually I always get really fatigued and tired (even though i've had 9 hours of sleep) after I've had these \"episodes\".\u00a0\u00a0I also have a heat problem.\u00a0\u00a0I get hot and sweaty doing the smallest task and sweat excessively doing regular exercise even though I am fairly fit and eat well and take my vitamins.Sometimes the symptoms are worse than at other times.\u00a0\u00a0I have dealt with this for a couple of years now and when my symptoms occur they are really debilitating and exhausting.\u00a0\u00a0A few months ago my symptoms were really bad, occuring every single time I got up, I was waking up with headaches, and when I woke up as my feet hit the floor I had a tingly pin-***** sensation on my feet bottoms.\u00a0\u00a0The fatigue was absolutely debilitating.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a doctor who did a few tests to satisfy my worries but did so very hostily.\u00a0\u00a0They did blood pressure tests which showed a huge drop upon standing but nothing was done about it.\u00a0\u00a0They also took blood tests because I thought maybe I had a vitamin deficiency but nothing was out of the ordinary.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just desperate to get some answers and be taken seriously.\u00a0\u00a0I know something isn't right.\u00a0\u00a0There's something going on in my body that keeps me from living life on a day to day basis with the energy and life a 19 year old college student should be living.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much!",
