            "answer": "Hello,Such kind of pain at tip of penis can be due to infection, inflammation or injury along the urethra or the glans itself. If you are sexually active then it can be due to STD\u2019s, prostatitis or this may be due to a dermatitis or a fungal infection. Contact or allergic dermatitis may occur and may cause some of these symptoms. Another differential will be a lower urinary tract infection.A complete physical examination by a urologist will be able to help. A urinalysis may be able to rule out infections in the urinary tract. Just prevent manipulation of the area as this may cause injuries and aggravate the pain. Wear cotton clothes and wash the area well.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
