            "answer": "So far, all of my blood tests come back normal for sugar.The way I understand it, the weight gain comes first.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone (not just PCOS sufferers) with a large waistline is at risk for developing insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0This is why Type II Diabetes has become more common.\u00a0\u00a0Other factors contributing to insulin resistance are what we've always been warned of:\u00a0\u00a0sedentary lifestyle, high fat diet, lack of exercise, etc.So, as long as we carry this excess weight (for whatever reason is behind it) I think it's important to fight insulin resistance by eating healthier and doing everything we're supposed to do to lead a healthy lifestyle.I am not insulin resistant, but when I did change my diet (did not go on a diet, just changed it) and started to get more active, I lost 10 lbs.Unfortunately, I don't know anything about DHEA-S.\u00a0\u00a0I have not heard of it, and I am definately no expert.\u00a0\u00a0I just offer my little knowledge of insulin resistance and my personal experience.Angel.",

    "question": "I have PCOS and I always wonder why women with this illness gain weight. I've done my research on the web and found that some sites blame high levels of DHEA-S and others blame Insulin Resistance.Which one is it? Right now I do have really high levels of DHEA-S but my glucose is within the normal low end of the reference range ..meaning its normal, so I don't really suffer from Insulin resistance. So I wonder if I can experience the weight gain from the DHEA-S being high rather than the Insulin that is mostly associated with weight gain in PCOS.Help?",
