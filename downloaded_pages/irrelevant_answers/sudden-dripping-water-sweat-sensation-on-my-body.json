            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Abnormal sensations of any kind are called paresthesias. There are many other causes of this nerve disorder including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use, multiple sclerosis, etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi, sounds to me like good old common stage fright.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of people experience this phenomenon when they have to stand in front of others, especially if they tend to feel self conscious.\u00a0\u00a0Only have to look at the number of people that sweat on stage, yet it's a freezing cold night - or worse those that sweat when they're bridesmades walking down the aisle.\u00a0\u00a0These events may be more catastrophic than yours - but it all depends on the nervous energy of the person and the anxiety related to public places.",

    "question": "I recently began experiencing a sudden sensation that feels like dripping water on my body. The sensation is more noticable in my lower body, but I have experienced the same dripping wet water feeling in my arms as well. The sensation comes so suddenly and gives me the feeling that I have just burst into sweat that is running down my body. I notice this feeling more around my thighs, front, back and inbetween. I am never wet after the sudden attack. It only happens when I am standing. I first noticed it while standing in church, which ocurred again. Then the other day while standing inside a fastfood. I thought maybe it might have something to do with my nerves. In both these situations I was dealing with people. I don't experience any tingling or pain, nothing other than the dripping water/ sweat feeling. I do not take any medications, or drugs either. What could be causing this? Has anyone else experienced this?",
