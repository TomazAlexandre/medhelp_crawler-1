            "answer": "Hello JM,As you may know, we are volunteers here and not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0One thing that's very important for all of us diabetics is to work with an endocrinologist, particularly one with which we can discuss all aspects of our disease.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that you develop this trust in your new medical team, and will tap into their collective expertise on the subject of pot and diabetes.I was diagnosed as a teen, \"discovered\" pot in college and enjoyed it on & off for about 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0Because of my own lessons learned the hard way, I don't recommend following my path.\u00a0\u00a0Pot, by itself, didn't seem to affect my blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0However, it materially affected my abiity to use good judgment and to maintain the essential self-control with respect to food and beverage choices.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, I endured blood-sugar fluctuations that did take a toll on me, tho' I am generally quite healthy now.My advice is to use your diabetes diagnosis to discover other, more healthful ways to unwind -- particular during the initial few years of learning (there is SO much to learn) about how your body endures this disease.I cannot tell from your msg if you were diagnosed with Type 1 (the auto-immune disease we focus on here) or Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0If you have Type 1 and are learning to manage insulin with food & beverages and exercise and stress, you are already experiencing the relentless balancing act that entails.\u00a0\u00a0If you were dx'd with Type 2, then you likely were also told to aim for weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0That guideline also works against smoking pot.Consider taking a yoga or dance class (don't laugh, it is WONderful :-)\u00a0\u00a0), or some other fitness or martial arts activity that will engage you physically (important for Type 1 and Type 2) and will provide an amazing outlet for decompressing after work.While I enjoyed my pot-smoking days \"at the time,\" I'm much more able to manage life and my diabetes without it. While the transition can seem difficult, the result is terrific and long-lasting -- unlike the high.",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed as type 2 diabetic a little over a year ago now.\u00a0\u00a0At the time I was not smoking pot.\u00a0\u00a0I monitored my blood sugar twice daily and I was having difficulty keep my levels below 185.\u00a0\u00a0Mostly they stayed in the range between 185 and 193.\u00a0\u00a0I walked and I watched what I ate.\u00a0\u00a0I kept a daily record.\u00a0\u00a0I started smoking pot with a friend of mine in the evenings, somewhere about September.\u00a0\u00a0From September to December I noticed my blood sugars dropped considerably.\u00a0\u00a0I never had a reading over 97 and usually the readings were between 83 and 93.\u00a0\u00a0I kept the same records I was keeping prior to the smoking of pot.\u00a0\u00a0I feel very assured that the pot was making the difference.\u00a0\u00a0I am not interested in finding a group that may be studying this for research.\u00a0\u00a0Right now I am doing my own research and I have been without pot again since December.\u00a0\u00a0My levels have gone up and are once again in the 180-210 range.\u00a0\u00a0Interestingly, when I was smoking over the holidays I was eating more sweets than I normally do and still the ranges were lower.\u00a0\u00a0I will again try the pot in a couple of months to make sure I'm getting a good result.\u00a0\u00a0Mild exercise is involved on a regular routine.\u00a0\u00a0But I had used that before the pot also.\u00a0\u00a0It did bring my levels down to around 180 from 230 or there abouts.\u00a0\u00a0But the pot pushed the levels way down.I'm a believer.",
