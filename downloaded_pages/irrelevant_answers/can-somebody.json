            "answer": "I started treatment 17 weeks ago and 2 weeks into treatment i got a yeast infection in my throat. The meds lowered my WBC which started it. To compound the problem my PCP thought it was a Bacterial infection and gave me Antibiotics which made it come back worse.After much trial and error with Drugs from the ENT (Ear Nose and Throat) Dr. that didn't work I finally started eating Yogurt twice a day and this was the only thing that treated it. Within 4 or 5 days I noted an improvement and within 2 weeks it was completely gone.This was after 2 and 1/2 months of various drugs.",

So putting some 'good' back in our system can usualy restore the balance.Good Luck!",
