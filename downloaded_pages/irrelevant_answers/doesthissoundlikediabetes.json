Sugar filled soda? What do you eat? How much. Are you overweight?Facial numbness? Not that I know of or have heard from any other diabetics.How old are you?Bottom line is you need to have a complete physical and blood work.Wish I could help more.You can't be diagnosed this way, and many of your symptoms are vague and contradictory.good luck",

What Sally said is true.\u00a0\u00a0until your doctor figures out what is going on please stay away from alcohol and soda with sugar in it. Even Mountain Dew with it's large amount of caffeine can cause palpitations.I am very concerned that you said you were a heavy drinker for 2 years before this.\u00a0\u00a0It can destroy your liver and if you are diabetic make you seriously ill. How is your diet? Honesty (:Please don't put off the doctors visit, as someone said \"Your way too young\"",
