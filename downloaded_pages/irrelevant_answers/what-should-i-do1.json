    "question": "I'm 38 weeks and 3 days.3cm dilated and my cervix is VERY VERY ripe!I've been dilated to 3 since 34 weeks.I just had an ultrasound about a week ago and was told he is already 8lbs 6oz.I also was just checked at that ultrasound appointment and my midwife said she stretched me a little but then when I was checked just a few days ago its still the same 3cm.I do not have gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, or any complications.Its not that I'm impatient (even though I would live to hold my baby right now), but more of the fact that Im really worried he will come over due and I will have to be induced. I don't want to be.I've tried orgasms,\u00a0\u00a0walking, sex, pineapple. And I was also told by my midwife that evening primrose oil will not help me seems how my cervix is already very very ripe.I really don't want to do castor oil because of everything negative I keep hearing about it. But I don't know what to do???Any opinions, comments, facts are welcome I just really don't want any negativity :)",
