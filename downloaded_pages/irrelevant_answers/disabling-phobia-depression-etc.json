            "answer": "I sent you an e-mail but I thought I would answer here too. I know what you are going through and boy it's not easy. I also have a driving phobia and I really don't know why it's just crazy. Right now I'm not suppose to be driving cuz of back spasms,I'm afraid I'll have one behind the wheel of the car. By the way I am also in my mid 50's. Is your drepression from being housebound? I know mine is. I was so used to being busy then when my back got hurt it stopped all that, now I am sooooooooo bored. I can't even be on the computer for too long or I will hurt myself even more. Do you take any medications? I am just now starting on Kolnipin and should be trying Zoloft soon. Hopefully this will help me. I am so sad for you! I feel your pain. I hate being dependent on others to take me places and to help me out. Would an anti-anxiety medication help you with your driving? I'm hope it will for me. If I could just drive locally around our small area I would be so happy. Could you try driving in a very small area first and see how that goes? I read in an anxiety book that if you start with just going around a block or just making right hand turns that sometimes that helps. That's what I hope to do eventually! Bless You and God Speed to us!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

            "answer": "Hi Suzzie,Thanks for answering. You know I never thought my depression was from being dependent on people. I am only dependent on my husband to take me places - which he does on weekends.. I still can walk and take buses and the subway (I live in a large city) to stores, etc. I think my depression has been with me for a long time and having chronic pain problems (fibromyalgia being one of them) doesn't make one overly happy!) I've been on antidepressents for over 10 years, I've tried getting off them but when I do I become suicidal within months. It seems I have to stay on them forever. It does get very discouraging though when winter hits, I find it difficult to walk in 30 or lower degree temperatures. Somedays in January and February I have to spend weeks at home when it's bitter cold outdoors. I also can't handle hot and humid temperatures either, so when it hits 90 or above I have to stay in air conditioning.",

    "question": "Hello,I am in counselling for depression and anxiety. I also have physical problems I am trying to deal with, i.e. chronic pain, diabetes, migraines, spine problems.\u00a0\u00a0I am a woman in my mid 50's. One of the biggest problems I have is the phobia of driving. Due to medical problems I had to stop learning to drive in my early 20's (vertigo spells and faintness) I still get occassional dizziness. However a car is almost a necessity and it is so hard for me to wait in the cold for buses now that I'm getting old and I'm not so healthy. I may also have to find a part time job because of financial problems we are having. I\u00a0\u00a0have tried to start driving in my 30's again but just got too scared when my ex yelled at me. My current husband says he will not teach me(he doesn't have the patience)\u00a0\u00a0and I can not use his car (he's too afraid of it being wrecked) However, the biggest problem is I'm just too scared, whenever I see the news of car accidents...I think ...oh boy that could have been me.",
