            "answer": "My OB said absolutely no diet drinks, but I never listened. I drank in moderation artificially sweetened iced tea while pg with my DD and she came out fine. Other OB's, and I've read in magazines that you can drink diet stuff in moderation, they just don't know of the long term birth effects.",

            "answer": "I was pregnant at the same time as a friend at work with diabetes (type 1) She drank lots of water but also diet drinks since she couldn't have the sugar. I too drank diet coke throughout my pregnancy, although not a lot. Her baby was fine, so was mine, and so was her second. Both of us had at most one 12 oz can or glass with sweetener a day I think, and on average even less. And most of it was aspartame (NutraSweet), which I think is likely worse for you than Splenda. Anyway, it turned out okay for both of us.",

            "answer": "I don't think there's enough data to prove the splenda is bad and no research on human has been done,although research on laboratory rats doesn't show damage to the baby.\u00a0\u00a0However most doctors tells their patience to take it in moderation, or even stay away from it.\u00a0\u00a0For diabetic mother-to-bes, it's probably better then going back to sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I sometimes have it in larger than recommended servings in deserts, but overall not much throughout.\u00a0\u00a0A doctor friend of mine said there's probably more pros than con to use splenda.\u00a0\u00a0The bottomline is that no body can say anything for sure yet since there's really no data to prove that's it's bad.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-caution is always good though.",

            "answer": "oh geez I have been drinking caffeine free, diet pepsi all throughout my pregnancy and this is the first time I have heard anything about not being able to drink diet drinks? Geez seems like you cant do anything. I can only hope that my baby is ok, and doc seems to think so. That would really suck if I found out that she had some kind of defect due to diet drinks. Oh well, nothing to do about it now. I am due this Thursday.",
