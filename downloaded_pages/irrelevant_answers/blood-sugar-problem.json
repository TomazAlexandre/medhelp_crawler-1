            "answer": "There is no doctor on this board. There are only other people with diabetes.Do you test your blood sugar at home? You should test it at various times including fasting (before breakfast) and two hours after different meals to see how certain foods affect your blood sugar. A goal some of us use is to have our fasting under 100 and our after meal blood sugar under 140.Do you watch your diet (limit carbs)? Do you exercise? Maintain a good weight? If you do all those things, take your meds and still have high blood sugar as well as feeling weak and drowsy like you say, then you need to return to your doctor and ask him what to do. He will probably change/or add to your meds. If you have been Type 2 for several years it may be time for insulin. Only your doctor can determine this.",
