            "answer": "As you know, you already had thyroid problems going into treatment. Treatment can exacerbate thyroid problems. Yours is a very complicated situation with many factors to be taken into consideration.We are not doctors here and I really think you need a competent and experienced doctor to manage your care. You do not say what type of doctor you are seeing. If you are seeing a family practice doctor or a general practice doctor, then I would highly suggest that you change doctors for your thyroid problems and make an appointment to see an experienced and competent endocrinologist. You live near San Diego. If I was you I would try to get an appointment with an endocrinologist at the Univ. of California San Diego.http://health.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspxhttp://health.ucsd.edu/request_appt/Pages/default.aspxRequest an AppointmentWhether you\u2019re looking for a primary care physician (PCP), need a specialist for treatment or are seeking a second opinion, you can make an appointment by selecting one of the methods below.New Patients (Patients who have never seen a UC San Diego Health System provider)To register as a new patient and schedule an appointment, call 800-926-8273, Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or fill out our online new patient appointment request form.Find a DoctorUse our online physician search to find a physician by name or to identify a specialistView UC San Diego Health System locations and telephone phone numbersIf you go to their website there are many options you can choose, including finding a doctor by specialty.http://doctors.ucsd.edu/?index=1&specialties=14ContactChoe, Charles H.Endocrinology, Diabetes & MetabolismMulti-Specialty Clinic8899 University Center LaneSan Diego, CA\u00a0\u00a092122Dillmann, WolfgangEndocrinology, Diabetes & MetabolismPerlman Medical Offices9350 Campus Point DriveLa Jolla, CA\u00a0\u00a092037Edelman, Steven VictorEndocrinology, Diabetes & MetabolismPerlman Medical Offices9350 Campus Point DriveLa Jolla, CA\u00a0\u00a092037Herbst, Karen LEndocrinology, Diabetes & MetabolismHillcrest - Medical Offices South4168 Front StreetSan Diego, CA\u00a0\u00a092103Hofflich, Heather L.Primary CareInternal MedicineEndocrinology, Diabetes & MetabolismInternal Medicine8939 Villa La Jolla DriveSuite 110La Jolla, CA\u00a0\u00a092037Hostetler, KarlEndocrinology, Diabetes & MetabolismMulti-Specialty Clinic8899 University Center LaneSan Diego, CA\u00a0\u00a092122Hupfeld, Christopher J.Endocrinology, Diabetes & MetabolismMulti-Specialty Clinic - Garden View1200 Garden View RoadEncinitas, CA\u00a0\u00a092024andHillcrest - Medical Offices South4168 Front StreetSan Diego, CA\u00a0\u00a092103Kado, DeborahEndocrinology, Diabetes & MetabolismUC San Diego Medical Center200 West Arbor DriveSan Diego, CA\u00a0\u00a092103andMulti-Specialty Clinic8899 University Center LaneSan Diego, CA\u00a0\u00a092122Oh, DeborahEndocrinology, Diabetes & MetabolismUC San Diego Medical Center200 West Arbor DriveSan Diego, CA\u00a0\u00a092103andHillcrest - Medical Offices South4168 Front StreetSan Diego, CA\u00a0\u00a092103andMulti-Specialty Clinic8899 University Center LaneSan Diego, CA\u00a0\u00a092122To register as a new patient (for any of these doctors) and schedule an appointment, call 800-926-8273, Monday to Friday, 8 a.m. to 4:30 p.m. or fill out our online new patient appointment request form.If you go to the web site and the Endocrinologist page, you can get more information on each physician:http://doctors.ucsd.edu/?index=1&specialties=14Wishing you the best.

            "answer": "Hi Jodi,I didn't respond earlier because I don't know anything about thyroid problems, but I did want you to know there are people who care even if they can't help. Pooh has given you excellent advise, and I hope you will find a doctor who can do a better job at not only figuring it all out but also explaining it clearly to you. You might also want to check out the forum here that is for thyroid problems \u2013 perhaps they can help clarify whatever you learn from your doctor. Good luck!",

            "answer": "Wow you cleared the virus in 2010. That is excellent news and very encouraging :)I am not seeing much connection with Hepatitis C - other than like Pooh said maybe the meds were hard on you. On the other hand apparently you have a family history of thyroid problems so there is that. It sounds like your doctor may have thought you were in remission for a while there. Plus it is possible you are Euthyroid.Either way you might want to ask your regular doctor for a referral to a good Endo so you can understand what if anything is happening and what your options are.___________________When it became apparent my thyroid was messed up and my TSH could only be managed with levothroxine I started learning about Hypothyroid. Then other things happened I had to have several other tests and I did not understand what any of them met let alone the results.Here are a few things that helped me get started:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Thyroid-Disorders/Thyroid-results---please-help-me-understand/show/1749407http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Thyroid-Disorders/Hashimoto-or-Graves/show/1825896http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Thyroid-Disorders/What-do-raised-TPO-Thyroid-Antibodies--normal-TSH-mean/show/1365082And this article:http://healhashimotos.tumblr.com/post/25393840500/what-thyroid-panel-to-request-from-your-practitioner",

            "answer": "Let me start from the beginning, and if I'm telling you what you already know, I apologize.TSH is a pituitary hormone.\u00a0\u00a0It is the messenger the pituitary sends to the thyroid to tell it to produce T3 and T4 (mostly).\u00a0\u00a0TSH, in and of itself, causes NO symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It is only when high TSH reflects low T3 and T4 (and vice versa) that it can be used as a proxy for thyroid hormones.FT3 and FT4 are much more important indicators.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is a couple of steps removed from the actual thyroid hormones, so if TSH doesn't agree with the others, it's the one that has to be ignored.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor is doing just the opposite, which is not unusual because doctors were taught in med school that TSH was the gold standard in thyroid testing.\u00a0\u00a0It's not, but the medical community is very slow to change.Any number of factors can affect TSH and make it useless.\u00a0\u00a0Any disturbance in the thyroid/hypothalamus/pituitay feedback cycle can cause TSH to be off.Your TSH is no longer tracking your FT4.\u00a0\u00a0It's been below 0.1 since 2/25 while your FT4 was anything from 0.9-1.8.\u00a0\u00a0Why?\u00a0\u00a0We don't know yet.\u00a0\u00a0Once on meds, some people see their TSH go to close to zero, never to bounce back up.\u00a0\u00a0Graves' is another possibility.\"I guess I thought that when I reduced the amount of medication I was taking that my numbers would reflect the change. Then when I stopped taking it all together and had labs done a month later I really expected that there would be a change in the right direction. What is happening to me?\"Your FT4 did exactly what one would expect it to do when you reduced, then discontinued your meds.\u00a0\u00a0Your FT4 started at 1.8, went to 1.5 after a reduction, then to 1.2 two weeks off meds and finally hit 0.9 after a month off meds.\u00a0\u00a0It takes meds 4-6 weeks to leave your system entirely, so you may not have seen bottom yet.\u00a0\u00a00.9 is very low in the range, and despite your TSH, you are hypo.Unfortunately, your doctor ordered total T3 rather than the much more useful free T3.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, considering your very low FT4, it doesn't look too bad, but it's total and not free.I'm only responding right now to your initial post and not anything that you've already been told in the rest of the thread that came from the other forum.I'll have more to say when you list your symptoms.",
