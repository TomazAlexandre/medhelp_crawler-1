            "answer": "Hi,Arm pain can travel if you have caused trauma to the muscles or nerves. The pain may be felt along the course of the muscle and nerve involved. Please consult your doctor for examination and treatment. You can take OTC painkillers for relief till you see the doctor. Hope this helps you. Please restrict heavy use of the affected arm. Take care and regards!",

            "answer": "Please make sure that they get a blood test on you, as well. Check for infection. I was diagnosed with an infection, and it travels constantly, and it went away after the 1ST DOSE of Levoquin, a penicillin-similar medication (I am still taking this). If your white blood cell count is high, don't let the pain travel any further. It seemed to attack me on the muscles I use the most, my hands/arms and finally went into my shoulder and inner chest muscles. Do not let this pain travel to your heart, that is an EMERGENCY. Also check for possible type 2 diabetes, I have to go back to the doctor in the morning to see if there is something abnormal causing the infection, so that it doesn't come back worse. I have been to the ER 5 times! Wrong diagnosis everytime (carpal tunnel), until I asked them to do a simple blood test for NMS (negative in this case - but they found the infection by testing my blood).",
