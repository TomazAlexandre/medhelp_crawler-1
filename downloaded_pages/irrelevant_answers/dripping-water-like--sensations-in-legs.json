            "answer": "Is the insomnia secondary to the leg sensations? If it is, and the EMG is normal this could represent restless leg syndrome. If the symptoms are only pain and tingling, it is possible that the EMG would be normal. This can happen in cases of small fiber neuropathy. There are special tests which can be done to diagnosis this disorder, but they are typically only done at large academic centers. Have you had the initial blood tests for peripheral neuropathy done, including a test for diabetes, inflammation, Vitamin B12, Folate, and thyroid dysfunction. You can discuss this with your doctor, and then seek further medical care as necessary. Good luck.",
