            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The heaviness could be due to a peripheral neuropathy like in diabetes, a pinched nerve at the elbow, muscle strain, peripheral artery disease, compartment syndrome or even due to carpel tunnel. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. An orthopedic doctor can also help you out.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi. I know it's been many months since you've posted, but I'm an 18 year young senior. I've been having the same issues for about a week now. My left arm just feels like it's a hundred pounds. It takes so much energy for me to do the smallest things with it. It's even difficult for me to type because my left arm just doesn't respond as fast as my right one. At age 13, I was diagnosed with epilepsy. I used to have grandmal seizures quite often. I'm thinking my epilepsy has something to do with it. What has your doctor said about you?",
