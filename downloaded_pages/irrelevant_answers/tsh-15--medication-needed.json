    "question": "Hi,I am a 30yo female, recently diagnosed w/Hashimotos. I had routine labwork that showed hyperthyroid on my TSH in June. Then I had a thyroid scan, US, needle biopsy and repeat labwork. This all showed bilateral cold nodules (6mm, 4mm) and the biopsy was benign. My repeat labs showed a TSH WNL, but both antibodies were high. I had more labs done 3 weeks ago, and the TSH was 15. I was prescribed L Thyroxine, but am hesitant to start medication that I will have to always take. I am wondering if my TSH can normalize itself w/out medication. I have not been symptomatic and this would not have been caught if not for routine labs. Can I take my chances on my TSH becoming normal without taking meds, or does my labwork show that this will never be \"normal\" again. Do I need meds if I don't have symptoms? Thanks.",
