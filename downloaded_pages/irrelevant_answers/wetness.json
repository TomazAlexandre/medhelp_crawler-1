If not it could be that you are now out of the honeymoon stage in your relationship and are moving into the comfortable stage. If this is the case, I would suggest trying new things together. Believe me I don't know a person out there that doesn't wish that the honeymoon stages was forever.",

    "question": "My current boyfriend and I have been together for over a year, and our sex life has always been one of the best parts of our relationship.\u00a0\u00a0We've always shared a heightened desire to make love above that of other people we know.\u00a0\u00a0But lately I feel like that's declined for me a lot, and it has occurred rather quickly, not steadily over time.\u00a0\u00a0I also used to get super wet, not just inside but outside as well.\u00a0\u00a0Now, even the few times I do get aroused and want sex, I don't get very wet at all.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any tips/suggestions?",
