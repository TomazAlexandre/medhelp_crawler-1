            "answer": "Hi!In all probability you son has asthma or allergic bronchitis, and any inflammation can cause low grade fever. Many viral conditions like EBV (glandular fever) behave in this way with recurrent respiratory infections. Many parasitic infestations and worms increase the eosinophil counts in the blood and thus cause an increased risk of upper respiratory infections. If diabetes runs in the family, then this should also be looked into. He needs appropriate treatment after the cause is found.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your son\u2019s doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thank your ever so much for your so precise close diagnose. We have been to a doctor and turns out you are right my son has had glandular fever ( IgG positive) but not recently. Now could all these respiratory infections still be linked to that glandular fever? The doctor gave him another blood test to investigate a probably genetic problem with his low (113 g/L) haemoglobin count which doesn't seem to be link to the infections. There is a mild (the pathology says ) Eosinophilia. What can I do to ease my son condition do it's been going for months now. When you have a virus infection do you just rest and wait? or should I try to strengthen my son immune system some how?Once again thank for your support. Sonia",

    "question": "Hello, my son (16 yo) has had low fever (37.5) for intermittently for several months as well sneezing and producing mucus all the time. He \"used to be\" allergic to dust mites but we believed he's grown out of it. He also feels weak. We have seen two different GP who say I don't know what it is keep a diary and come back. We aren't good at keeping diaries so I don't know if I should try a unconventional doctor for this recurrent problem. Do you have any idea if this is nromal ?",
