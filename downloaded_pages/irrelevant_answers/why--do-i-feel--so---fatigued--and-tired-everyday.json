            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dry mouth and throat can be due to either diabetes mellitus or due to diabetes insipidus. Get this tested. Another possibility is sleep disturbances. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Other possibilities are hypothyroidism, anemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, poor sleep patterns, inadequate sleep, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "It could be a lowered level of testosterone.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the panels they took, they may not have looked at testosterone levels that can directly impact the things you describe.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if they did test T levels, I'd say that it still could potentially be sub-clinical levels of low T.\u00a0\u00a0Ringing in your ears may or may not mean anything in particular, but having your hearing checked is always a good thing and mentioning it to the ENT specialist can be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Other potential issues could be related to thyroid issues, but that would likely have shown up in blood panels.",
