            "answer": "Each ml is TWO units. Ask your pharmacist or nurse to follow up and ask your doctor/nurse to set you up IMMEDIATELY for diabetic counseling. Leave with complete understanding, (ask lots of questions) especially with insulin. Never guess... it may be your last guess or worst mistake. Check out The American Diabetes Association website NOW!",

            "answer": "Please call your doctor's office to get your dose and type of syringe to use clarified before using. Appropriate syringes are made for use with the respective insulin, marked with the correct measure for dosage. To avoid mistakes [under/over dosage] I strongly recommend that you use matching insulin and syringes. ie; a U type syringe.",

            "answer": "I am going to concur with Waverider and egbrew.There is a basic problem in that nobody has adequately explained to you the use of your life-saving medications. Do not be embarrassed to tell the doctor of health care practicioner \"I don't understand\" and walk out of the office.These people are so used to dealing with medications and diabetes they sometimes fail to understand how difficult it is for a lay person to listen to a three-minute briefing and come away with understanding.This is not your fault. It is the fault of the system.If you have questions about this I can imagine there is a lot about the disease and insulin that your doctor thinks you know, that you may not know.Many diabetic centers offer \"mini-courses\" for people who have just been diagnosed with diabetes. Sometimes they have lectures and video presentations.And if there is anything whatsoever you don't understand don't leave the office until it is clear.",
