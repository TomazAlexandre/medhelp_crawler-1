            "answer": "Dear steennd,While I'm a volunteer for JDRF and not a doctor, I would seek a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0If you had ketones in your urine and weight loss, plus thirst and urinating more than normal it could be a sign of type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Please don't think you are a hypochondriac.\u00a0\u00a0There can be many reasons for your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to research this more with other volunteers who may have more experience with this.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I would suggest a second opinion. I will get back to you.dm",

            "answer": "When I first started showing symptoms of Diabetes Type 1 - I had blurred vision which at first I attributed to computer eye strain (and so did my optometrist at first - but he was suspicious and urged me to have my blood tested).I wasn't thristy, didn't go to the bathroom frequently, didn't lose rapid weight, and wasn't hungry.All of those classic symptoms came crushing in about a month later .... hit me all at once one weekend.",

    "question": "Do all people have the frequent urination and thirst symptom when they are diagnosed?I am starting to suspect that I may in fact have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am 27yo F.\u00a0\u00a0I had my second child 6 months ago and since that time I have lost a TON of weight (137 pre-preg, now 117 at 5'6\").\u00a0\u00a0I am breastfeeding, so that could account for some.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have terrible jitters/anxiety and I have tingling in my fingers. I had a very rough pregnancy when I had excessive nausea and vomitting (hyperemesis) where a real cause was never found- and since I was starving I had ketones in my urine on several occasions and had to be hospitalized. I'm wondering if maybe these events to my body triggered diabetes. My GF was diagnosed with type 1 at age 25.I am not excessively thirsty, maybe a little more so.\u00a0\u00a0 I attributed it to breastfeeding.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have gestational diabetes, but I did start to spill glucose in my urine late in the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0 I have been seeing my dr about this but she says that I have a postpartum depression/ anxiety disorder- but that doesn't make sense to me because I am very hungry and eat often and a lot.\u00a0\u00a0She tested my blood sugar (among other things) and it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Also, she tested my thyroid twice because I really thought I was hyperthyroid- it was normal.Do you all think that maybe I still could have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Should I call my dr back?\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure she's gotta think that I'm a hypochondriac by now- but normally I am NEVER sick and now I feel terrible and wonder what's wrong with me.",
