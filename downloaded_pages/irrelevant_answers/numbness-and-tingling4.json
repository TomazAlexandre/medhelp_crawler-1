            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your fingers, hands, feet, arms, or legs. Possible causes for tingling and numbness are diabetes, TIA's, stroke, multiple sclerosis, seizures etc.In case there is weakness in the limbs with tingling and numbness, as in your case, it could be mostly due to lacunar infarcts or TIA's.I would suggest that you get a CTscan brain done and take an opinion of a neurologist.Risk factors for the occurence of TIA's are hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes etc. As you have the risk factors it is necessary to get evaluated.All the best.",
