            "answer": "Hi:I suppose that your hypothetical is possible theoretically, but it has to be very rare. Candida is not listed as a sexually transmitted disease, so I'd have to agree with your Doctor.As for how you could have got it, this is a mystery. Generally, candida presents in immunocompromised people (those with AIDS or Cancers). Since you've been cleared, there are some other reasons for this overgrowth of yeast. These might include antibiotic use or poor dental hygeine.Hope this helps,JOHN W. (R.Ph)",

            "answer": "Do you use inhaled steroids for asthma? if so, many of the steroid inhalers (i.e. Flovent, beclovent, vanceril) cause this problem because steroids contribute to the over-growth of fungi which lead to thrush and candida esophagitis. If you, or anyone else uses these, it is best to rinse your mouth immediately after use.Just a thought,JOHN W.",
