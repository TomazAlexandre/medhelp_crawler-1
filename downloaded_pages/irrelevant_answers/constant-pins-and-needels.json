            "answer": "HiThanks for the post! How are you now?After parathyroid surgery, pins and needles sensation occurs due to low calcium and lasts for a long time, requiring prolonged calcium supplementation. In your case the dose of calcium needs to be adjusted. Also you must rule out diabetes too.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
