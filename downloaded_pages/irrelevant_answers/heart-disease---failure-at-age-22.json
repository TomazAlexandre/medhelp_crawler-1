            "answer": "Hi Sarahlucy,nothing of the things you described sound alarming to me.Your resting HR is just fine. A HR of 115/120 while walking and 170+ during working out are also quite normal values for a 22 year old.Of course the cardiologist does tests to rule out anything out of the ordinary.Believe me, heart failure and serious heart disease give different and graver symptoms than the ones you describe.try to relax till the stress test and the consult with your cardiologist.I expect that the tests will reveal that your heart is just fine.",

    "question": "Hi everyone. I'm 22 year old female, I don't have high BP, cholesterol, diabetes, etc.I have a low resting Hr (50's) that gets high when I just walk around or clean (115/120)... and when I work out can reach 170+. I do get tired and SOB sometimes but nothing too much to make me stay home or not do something. Anyways. I'm going to a cardiologist currently... ive already had an echo, spirometer test,24 holter monitor, ekg, blood work and 6min walk test recently. I'm due for a stress test in a few weeks and then I found mind out all my results. When the cardiologist listened to my heart and went over my file she said she didn't think anything was wrong but wanted to make sure I don't have an underlying condition... I assume that's why all the test. Anyways I've been a mess this past 1& half months. All I can think about is getting diagnosed with heart disease or failure. Any opinions?",
