            "answer": "I don't have GD but I have lost weight my entire pregnancy. My first trimester I lost about 7lbs, my second I gained 5 , and each prenatal appointment I go to now every two weeks I lose 1-4 lbs. It's not normal but doc says as long as she is healthy, everything is fine. She is measuring right on schedule. I will be 36 weeks Mon. Doc also said as long as I don't lose like 10lbs or more everything is fine",

            "answer": "thanks ladies. ive done alittle\u00a0\u00a0ready and it doesn't\u00a0\u00a0seem like its a huge concern...unless like you mentioned a drastic weight lose. apparently the last few weeks you can lose weight as amniotic fluid production decreases and the nesting starts (burning more calories\u00a0\u00a0from all the cleaning) plus not being able to eat as much with the stomach being squished. I'll still\u00a0\u00a0mention\u00a0\u00a0it to the midwife because they dont weight you every visit.",
