            "answer": "There is no way that I could predict his life expectancy without transplantation. Though sometimes doctors can predict with some specificity most often they are reluctant to do so and often times they really don't know how long someone will live or how quickly the liver will deteriorate to the point of failure. My advice to you is to contact a transplant center close to you and arrange for an appointment for him to be evaluated. Generally his doctor must refer him and frequently the referring doctor must be a GI or hepatologist. I personally know several people who received liver transplants who did not have means. The government will pay for the surgery if you qualify. But first you must get a referral and explore this with a transplant center to get the necessary information so as to proceed. This can be a lengthy process and so I would suggest that he (and you) get started soon. Don't allow him to just accept his situation because he is without money. He needs an advocate and it looks like that advocate might be you. So push this thing if he would like a chance to live a longer and more fulfilled life. It can be done without money. I've seen many people get livers. One who comes to mind was not only without means but he was also on methadone from a previous addiction to heroin and he got a liver and is doing well 3.5 years later. So get busy if that's what he really wants. Good luck. Mike",

He is currently in hospital because he also has ulcerative colitis and it flared up and he had lots of bleeding etc.He had to have an emergency operation to remove his large intestine as the bleeding was not stopping.\u00a0\u00a0Well first it did and he was fine showered and shaved then the doctor gave him lactolose,because of his liver. To this point though he had no idea he had a liver problem and was in fine health other than the colitis.Anyways they gave him lactolose which of course was not taking into concideration the colitis(the reason he was there) anyways he bleed so profusly he had to be give three blood transfutions,and ruptured him large intestine.He was complaning of stomach pain and the doctors ignored him, meanwhile his bowel was spilling into his abdomen.Emergency surgey now he has a colostme bag.So then the doctors told me he may live through this surgery but his liver is failing and he is going to die with in 6 months.So I have been searching online for more information and have read that he shouldn\u00e8t eat protein,Tonight I went to the hospital and they are force feeding him protein drinks.His eyes are now yellow and he is very confused.Much worse than before. And before the colitis flaring up he was fine last week he was putting in fences.His also now septic from the fecal matter sitting in his abdomen for 36hrs.I hope the doctors know what they are doing but really after seeing him getprogressively worse I really\u00a0\u00a0don't.Anyways question is should someone who is end stage be being force fed protein drinks?I hope someone who knows responds before these people kill my father.",
