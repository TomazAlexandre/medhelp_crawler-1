            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You have severe constipation and passing hard stools itself can cause injury to mucosa of gut and bleeding. Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber and also due to dehydration. A high roughage with low water too could be a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc can all cause constipation. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Too many tape worms or round worms forming a bolus or ball could also be the cause. A proper investigation is required preferably by a gastroenterologist (a doctor who looks after the digestive system) to know what is the cause. The treatment will follow correct diagnosis.Meanwhile increase fluid intake and roughage in your diet. Hope this helps. Take care!",
