            "answer": "OK, glucose levels are pretty easy to explain. Since you posted on the type 2 forum I'm going to assume you want t2 figures. You also didn't tell us where you're from so I'm posting both measurement values - USA is mg/dl, Europe mmol/l.First thing in morning before breakfast is called preprandial.Normal levels are 60/70 to 99 mg/dl, or 3.33/3.88 to 5.5 mmol/lPrediabetes levels are 100 to 125 mg/dl, or 5.55 to 6.94 mmol/lAbove the above is considered diabetes.After meals is called postprandial. Test 2-3 hours after eating when sugars from foods you ate have plateaued in your blood stream.Normal levels for non-diabetics are same as aboveFor diabetics the goal is <141 mg/dl, or 7.83 mmol/l. Optimum is <121 mg/dl, or 7.72 mmol/l. If you can obtain normal levels then you get a big attaboy/attagirl.Low levels are below 60 mg/dl, or 3.33 mmol/l. Below 40 mg/dl, or 2.22 mmol/l is considered dangerous/life threatening.Post back to this thread if you need further clarification.",

            "answer": "asok475 - Please ask whoever provided those numbers to you why higher levels is better/accepted over past years lower levels [what I reference] and not the other way around. It just doesn't make sense for it to be OK for type 2 diabetics to have higher levels and have those higher levels be considered normal/acceptable. If they refer to web sites such as the ADA [American Diabetes Association] or the Canadian Diabetes Association web site did you know both are sponsored by major drug firms, and there are others including several major hospitals. The wolf is watching the sheep.",
