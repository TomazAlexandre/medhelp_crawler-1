I never had washboard abs but I am far from being pudgy either. I had a little and I do mean little pooch already so I can't tell one way or the other. I hope it's my bump coming but it's hard to tell.",

Im 12 weeks and a few days ago I looked down to shave and was shocked that I cudnt see more than half my bush just by looking down.\u00a0\u00a0Tried pulling up my not so big but very noticeable pooch and it felt hard. Clothes don't fit d same anymore dats for sure. But I still cant tell whether im just bloated, gaining weight or simply growing a bump.",

    "question": "Ever since I find out I was pregnant I've been nutrition conscious because I had gestational diabetes with my previous pregnancy. However, that was 10yrz ago! I'm only 12 weeks and I can't tell if this belly is from weight gain or pregnancy! I feel it hard near my hip line, but my bump is fairly noticeable! I was thinking maybe it's from all the acid reflux and bloating? I haven't even been eating much the last 3wks because the nausea and vomiting had me starving cuz nothing stayed in my system... feeling very frustrated and uncomfortable... Can Anyone Relate??? :/",
