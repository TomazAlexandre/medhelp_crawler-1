            "answer": "If your hemoglobin dropped from 15 to 12 within only a few weeks -- then you may be a candidate for Procrit (epo) as Frijole suggests. Don't know if you have too many side effects yet or not, but it can happen with an alarming suddeness. Weekly blood counts are in order with that drop. Also, Procrit can take 2-4 weeks to work, so you might want to get the insurance process moving. Don't know what you've heard about \"Procrit sx\" but I found them minimal and nothing compared to the sfx of anemia, not to mention that if you hgb drops too much they may have to pull you off tx or reduce your riba which will reduce your chance of SVR.Not sure what you mean that your liver was \"inflamed\" so you started with less Peg? The general principle is to hit the virus hard and fast in the beginning. If your liver was so inflamed at that point, why even start treatment then? I had what might be termed an inflammation from some Chinese Herbs -- ALT near 1000 -- and the decision was to delay tx until things calmed down.Are you being treated by a liver specialist (hepatologist) or a Gastro? Something about the protocol you're following leads me to believe it's a gastro. I'd see a hepatologist and get a second opinion on what's going on.-- Jim",

            "answer": "I'd try and keep on full-dose meds as much as possible, including weight based ribavirin. You can figure out your dose here and then discuss with your doctor:http://www.hivandhepatitis.com/2005icr/aasld/docs/111805_a.htmlJust keep in mind, that if weight-based for you is more than 800mg, then your hgb may drop even faster, but that's the name of the game if you want to rid yourself of the virus -- and that's where Procrit can be helpful.Your pre-tx viral load is a good sign, although those are quite high enzymes, but you've already started. I assume you'vve been monitoring your enzymes weekly since you started treating? I would with pre-tx enzymes that high. I'd also ask for weekly viral load tests until UND using as sensitive an assay as possible. Something like Heptimax from Quest Diagnostics that goes down to 5 IU/ml. If they won't do it weekly, at a minium have a week 4 test done. You draw blood for that test the day before your fifth injection.All\u00a0\u00a0the best,-- Jim",

            "answer": "Best to do the blood draw as close as possible to the injection, but before the injection. That will give you a conservative \"trough\" value. So, for example, if you inject Friday evening, you could have blood drawn either Thursday or anytime Friday, but before you inject. And if you can, keep doing those viral load tests every week until you're UND. BTW your results should have been in by now if you took the test 2 weeks ago. Make a pest of yourself if necessary, but have the nurse call the lab and get the results. And yes, I type fast but think slow, so forgi ve the typos :)-- Jim",

Most of the problems occur when patient take too much.\u00a0\u00a0The blood can get too thick and, yes, it can be a strain on the heart.\u00a0\u00a0But on the other hand, google anemia and see how much damage to the system that can do.\u00a0\u00a0Procrit is very helpful to us how suffered with the anemia, and I think you are in that category.frijole",
