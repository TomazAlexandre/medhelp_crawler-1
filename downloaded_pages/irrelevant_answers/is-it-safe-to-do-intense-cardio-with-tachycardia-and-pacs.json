            "answer": "You pose a very interesting question, that should be addressed by your cardiologist. There are several different reasons for a high heartrate. It could be something as simple as a magnesium deficiency. Sometimes medications can treat the condition. I would er on the side of caution, but I would try hard to get a second or a third in-person opinion from a spedcialist.",

    "question": "I've started working out every day pretty intensely, as I'm trying to get very strong. I'm a seventeen year-old girl, and I was recently diagnosed to PACs and tachycardia, much to my surprise. I was completely unaware of these conditions until I went to my annual physical (which was the event my doctor discovered the conditions), two specialists, and had to wear a holter monitor for a day. My heartbeat is usually around 120, but the holter revealed it fluctuates anywhere from 56 to 173 BPM when I am not exercising. I have no idea how fast it goes when I exercise intensely or even at all.Basically, I want to know if it's safe for me to be doing intensely strenuous exercises and intense cardio. I really want to be super strong and fit, and I know there are certain limits of mine involving cardio. Ex: I can't run a mile in under ten minutes because my heart prevents me from being able to breathe enough. But I use the stairmaster regularly and do intense muscular workouts, and I just wanted to make sure I'm not putting myself in danger.Thank you. :)",
