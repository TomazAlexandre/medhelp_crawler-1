    "question": "I am at my wits end. I have been getting eye infection after eye infection for over a year. At first I went to my regular doctor, then my optometrist and now an ophthalmologist.\u00a0\u00a0At first they were every 3-4 months, then monthly, and now they are occurring two weeks apart. Ophthalmologist thought it was my contacts but I've been wearing them for decades with no problems. I switched to dailys anyway and got an infection a week later. Now my eyes are infected again even though I haven't worn contacts in three weeks. I'm on Pataday in the morning and a drop of Lotemax at night and the infection still came back again today. What is wrong with me?!? I just want to cry. :(\u00a0\u00a0Eyelid scrubbing and tears are not helping either. And I've been checked for diabetes, I am fine. Please help.",
