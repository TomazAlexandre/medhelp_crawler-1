            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!If you are smelling it every where then definitely the odor is strong and needs to be investigated. There could be something wrong with your husband medically. Please do not ignore it.Generally bad odor is due to infection, mainly by E coli. This can be diagnosed by urine culture. Strong fruity odor is due to uncontrolled diabetes. Urinary bladder infection and kidney infections do produce strong smelling urine. Another reason is dehydration. Strong ammonia smell is due to protein breakdown.Give him plenty of water and see if the smell improves. Also talk to your doctor regarding these possibilities.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
