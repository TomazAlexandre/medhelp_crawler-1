            "answer": "you may need to treat your diabetes are more aggressively for your chances of SVR may be significantly less. Hopefully, someone with more information on this will show up soon. so given this, plus your stage and age, strongly suggest that you treat with a hepatologist (liver specialist) as opposed to a gastroenterologist or general practitioner. This is a fast-moving field, and hepatologists simply no the landscape better. In all due respect to family doctors, in many cases they know less about hepatitis C than a reasonably intelligent person could find out on the Internet in 10 minutes.All the best,Jim",

            "answer": "you need to find a hep doctor - unfortunately man doctors who do specialize in this field (GI's) even have trouble keeping up with all the latest advances and studies (of which there are many) let alone a family doctor who is pretty much just reading out of an old text book.\u00a0\u00a0VERY important for someone with 'complications' to treatment to get the BEST most knowledable doctor you can.I was about 15 years younger than you when I started treatment, as a stage 3 I never knew I had it and had had no symptoms myself. I did develope hypothyroid on treatment but you are already on the meds which are controlling the problem so basically you don't have anything to lose there - the thyroid is already shot you might just have to change your dosage I'd think. The diabetes can be an issue - but I don't nkow much about that so can't advise.I had to treat for 72 weeks due to a slow response (see once again the new studies have told us helpful information) but i have been cured for two years as of 2/8/9 - it can be a tough treatment but for the most part it is doable.Find that specialist doc right now - then get copies of all your tests and put them in a folder. ALWAYS get all the results right away and keep them.\u00a0\u00a0Learn what everything means. The more knowledge you have the better off your chances of success.You could always begin treatment and see how you respond - if you seem to be having difficulties due to the diabetes........you could stop and do it again someday.\u00a0\u00a0At stage 3 (there is NO linear progression, it could take you 20 years to get to stage3 but only five years to be stage 4 and cirhotic) you do want to be a bit more proactive than not. That is my opinion and why I treated for so long.Good luck.",

            "answer": "I agree with by nygirl7 and jmjm530. Get a specialist, a hepatologist.The main issue I see for you is you are at stage 3 of the 4 stages of liver disease. This is a recent biopsy I assume? Do you know your \u201cGrade\u201d (the amount of liver inflammation)? This may help to indicate how quickly your disease is progressing. You do not want to wait to reach stage 4 as your chance of SVR goes way down at that point. You want to give yourself the best chance of beating this viral. So I would recommend learning all you can and treating this year if your hepatologist agrees.I would try the Interferon/Ribavirin standard treatment for 12 weeks to see if and how you respond. Yes you will have to treat for 48 weeks or even 72 weeks if you respond. Yes it is a hassle and a pain to do this. But what if you don't respond to treatment and you reach stage 4, cirrhosis? Then you will begin to start experiencing symptoms of liver disease which will get progressively worse and lessen your chances of the HCV treatment working. You don't want this to happen.At that point your only options are new meds that you respond to or a liver transplant (make 48 weeks of treatment seem like nothing) . These are not good options.It you do the treatment you will know if and how you respond to treatment. A good hepatologist these days can tell usually within 4-8 weeks (by analyzing your viral response) if you will respond to treatment. Based on your viral response you will know your odds of SVR if you continue to treat for 48 or 72 weeks.I am telling you this based on my own experience being at stage 4 an a null responder.Needless to say. Don't drink alcohol or take meds such as NSAIDs that are harmful to your liver as these will speed up the progression of your liver disease.Best of luck.HectorSF",

DeBakey VA Medical Center, Houston, TX 77030, USA.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Several studies found hepatitis C (HCV) increases risk of Type II diabetes mellitus (DM). However, others found no or only sub-group specific excess risk. We performed meta-analyses to examine whether HCV infection does increase DM risk in comparison to the general population and in other sub-groups with increased liver disease rates including with hepatitis B (HBV). METHODS: We followed standard guidelines for performance of meta-analyses. Two independent investigators identified eligible studies through structured keyword searches in relevant databases including PubMed. RESULTS: We identified 34 eligible studies. Pooled estimators indicated significant DM risk in HCV-infected cases in comparison to non-infected controls in both retrospective (OR(adjusted)=1.68, 95% CI 1.15-2.20) and prospective studies (HR(adjusted)=1.67, 95% CI 1.28-2.06). Excess risk was also observed in comparison to HBV-infected controls (OR(adjusted)=1.80, 95% CI 1.20-1.40) with suggestive excess observed in HCV+/HIV+ cases in comparison to HIV+ controls (OR(unadjusted)=1.82, 95% CI 1.27-2.38). CONCLUSIONS: Our finding of excess DM risk with HCV infection in comparison to non-infected controls is strengthened by consistency of results from both prospective and retrospective studies. The excess risk observed in comparison to HBV-infected controls suggests a potential direct viral role in promoting DM risk, but this needs to be further examined.",

            "answer": "If you choose to take the Hep C treatment, one of your biggest issues is going to be the diabetes.People are usually insulin resistant (insensitive to insulin) for years before they become diabetics....and insulin resistance tends to get worse over time.\u00a0\u00a0When you're insulin resistant (insensitive to insulin), your pancreas may be producing enough insulin but since your body is insensitive to it, it can't use it.....so your pancreas has to make MORE insulin to be able to keep your blood sugar at a normal level.And having too much insulin....makes the medication used for Hep C treatment ineffective!So having high blood sugar is not really the problem.....the problem is the large amounts of insulin that have to be produced to compensate for being insulin resistant.In other words, your pancreas is probably producing large amounts of insulin to be able to keep your blood sugar within normal limits....and that can cause the Hep C treatment to fail.It also depends what you call having \"good tests\".\u00a0\u00a0Studies have shown that having a fasting blood sugar higher than 100 lowers treatment success....(and I doubt that your fasting blood sugar is always below 100).\"Glucose >100 mg/dl Reduces Interferon/RBV SVR\"http://www.natap.org/2008/HCV/031008_01.htmEven though you may not need medication to lower your blood sugar, taking medication that improves sensitivity to insulin (like Metformin) may make a big difference in the outcome of your treatment.This is a great article to give to your doctor if he's not familiar with the association between Hepatitis C, insulin resistance and treatment non-response......\"Hepatitis C and insulin resistance: steatosis, fibrosis and non-response.\"http://scielo.isciii.es/scielo.php?pid=S1130-01082006000800006&script=sci_arttextGood luck to you,Co",

AASLD Nov 2008)Insulin-Resistance in Chronic Hepatitis C patients: New Predictor of Sustained Virological Response Independent of HCV Genotype and Liver Fibrosis Stage.Background & Aim: Insulin-Resistance (IR) has been previously shown to impair sustained virological response (SVR) rate in chronic hepatitis (CHC) patients infected with genotype 1 when treated with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. The aim of this study was to assess the independent impact of IR after adjustment to major predictors of SVR, particularly HCV genotype and liver fibrosis stage. Patients and Methods: 167 consecutive non-diabetic treatment-na\u00efve CHC patients, treated in our centre with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin, were prospectively assessed. Insulin resistance was assessed using the Homeostasis Model (HOMA-IR). HCV genotype was determined by sequencing. Serum HCV RNA was quantified using bDNA (Bayer Versant HCV RNA 3.0 Assay). Liver histology was assessed using the METAVIR score. SVR was defined as undetectable serum HCV RNA 24 months after treatment stopping. Results: Baseline characteristics were: male gender (66%), mean age (46\u00b19 years), mean BMI (24\u00b14 kg/m2), excessive alcohol consumption (9%). Blood transfusion and intravenous drug injection were the principal source of transmission (52%). HCV genotype distribution was: 1 (47%), 2 (7%), 3 (24%), and 4 (22%). Mean serum HCV RNA level was 5.5\u00b10.7 log10 IU/mL, and 42% of patients had high serum HCV RNA level (>600 000 IU/mL). Median value of HOMA-IR was 2.1 (IQL range 1.1-4.6). Liver histology showed moderate-severe necroinflammation (METAVIR score A2-A3) in 46%, severe fibrosis (METAVIR score F3-F4) in 32%, and severe steatosis (>30%) in 29% of patients. By univariate analysis, SVR was associated with HOMA-IR, HCV genotype, serum HCV RNA level, liver fibrosis stage and steatosis. Patients with HOMA-IR 2 (72% vs. 44% respectively, p<0.01). Patients infected with genotypes 2 and 3 achieved higher SVR rates than those infected with genotypes 1 and 4 (79% vs. 46% respectively, p<0.001). Patients with low viral load achieved higher SVR rate than those with high viral load (67% vs. 44% respectively, p<0.01). Patients with mild-moderate fibrosis achieved higher SVR rate than those with severe fibrosis (62% vs. 44% respectively, p<0.05). Patients with mild-moderate steatosis achieved higher SVR rate than those with severe steatosis (62% vs. 42% respectively, p<0.05). By logistic regression, SVR was associated only with HCV genotype 2 and 3 (p<0.001, OR=4.5, CI=2.0-9.8) and with HOMA-IR <2 (p<0.01, OR=2.8, CI=1.4-5.5) Conclusion: Insulin-Resistance is a major negative predictor of SVR in CHC patients treated with pegylated interferon plus ribavirin. Impact of Insulin Resistance is independent of HCV genotype and liver fibrosis stage.",

My fitness level was and is good. Even so, the tx was difficult and detoxing post tx has been slow.You sound like your mind is made up to 'jump in' to treatment. I would suggest anyone address all health issues prior to tx.Someone posted the stats for response/non-response for those with IR. The overall treatment success for those of us 60 and over is said to average 20%.The odds seem to be against you. But, if you make it the outlook is very good that your liver will heal itself to some degree.150 people who achieved SVR were given biopsies five years post SVR. Only 12.5% of those with cirrhosis went on to develop HCC (liver cancer) The other 87% did very well, The outlook for all others is excellent.link to study:\u00a0\u00a0http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/cgi-bin/fulltext/121477214/HTMLSTARTsincere best wishes whatever your decision,Max",

Occaisional sort of stabbing in the liver area,lasts about a few seconds.. lays way back.. may repeat one or two times.. and is over in minutes.Never hangs on. Isn't daily. sometimes I go weeks with nothing at all.48 Weeks seems a long time.. and I'm wondering about the side effects, and how they will affect my daily life.I also wonder if the treatment of those side effects isn't also troublesome in ways I'm not aware of, drugs being what they are.How knocked around should I expect to be during this? 160 lbs, 5' 10\".I am hypothryoid, but it's been perfectly managed with no trouble for 20 years.I'm also diagnosed type II diabetes, but no meds or symptoms.
