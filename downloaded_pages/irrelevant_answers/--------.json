            "answer": "Try therapy to determine if your depression has a root cause, they often do.\u00a0\u00a0It's usually something traumatic that happened in your past that you haven't really dealt with, or have forgotten.\u00a0\u00a0Often after learning what this is and dealing with it you can move on with your life and as a happier person.\u00a0\u00a0A therapist can teach you coping techniques, and help you talk out your issues.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise, even just walking is great for depression, making yourself get out with friends, and doing things you enjoy, even if you have to make yourself do this. This is often hard to do with depression since if makes you lose interest in everything, but you can do it.\u00a0\u00a0None of us want to take the meds but when all else fails, we have to do whatever it takes to live a happy, and productive life.\u00a0\u00a0I tell people to view depression as any other health condition.\u00a0\u00a0If you were diganosed with diabetes you wouldn't think twice about taking the needed medications for that, and depression is no different.\u00a0\u00a0Know you're not alone, we been there and many still are, so we understand what you're going through!\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry you are going through this and hope you find some relief soon.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best and take care.",
