            "answer": "Hi,I have had 2 diabetic pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0Both were successful and my girls are perfect 3 and 6 yo.\u00a0\u00a0Both weighted about 7 lbs at birth (ie. normal);\u00a0\u00a0though I have had quite a few miscarriages, they were not diabetes related.\u00a0\u00a0I use about 40-45\u00a0\u00a0units of insulin a day and I my latest Hba1c was 5.4.The most important thing is that you1. Eat low carb.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugars cannot be well controlled (70-120 is the target range) if you don't eat low carb (moderate protein and high healthy fats).2. You personally learn to adjust your insulin to control your blood sugar.3. You need to test blood sugar regularly.4. As you are planning pregnancy you need to find a diabetes fetal medicine specialist to work with.What insulins are you on?\u00a0\u00a0Are you taking basal and bolus (ie. 2 insulins).\u00a0\u00a0You need to adjust your basal insulin so that your blood sugar is flat (and on target) even if you don't eat.\u00a0\u00a0You then need to work out your carb:insulin and carb to protein ratio so that you properly dose insulin before eating.\u00a0\u00a0You also need to use your fast acting to adjust your blood sugar if you are high between meals.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Do not be shy to adjust your blood sugar, as long as done carefully an with frequent testing.I recommend you go to the following UTube site and study what is said:\u00a0\u00a0\"Bernstein Diabetes University\" or you can also get his book \"Diabetes Solutions\" by Dr. Richard Berstein.If and when you get pregnant you can expect your blood sugars to go crazy.\u00a0\u00a0You have to increase and adjust your insulin immediately (with lots of testing).\u00a0\u00a0For example, I conceived last cycle (but lost it - I am no spring turkey).\u00a0\u00a0I knew within 24 hours of conception because my insulin requirements increase by 80% nearly immediately.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to keep my blood sugar under control.\u00a0\u00a0I knew I lost it before my period because my blood sugars starting going down.For women you may find that your insulin requirements are different in the first half vs. second half of the month.\u00a0\u00a0I increase my insulin about 20% in the second half of the month (particularly I have to increase my bolus insulins).Ask questions.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know what else we can do or answer.",

    "question": "I've been a diabetic for 10 years and in the 10 the only time I had my sugars undercontrol was when I was 20 to 22. I have lost 3 babies due to high blood sugars. I noticed when my hormones are out of control so are my sugars. I eat the same thing I ate when I had my sugars under control but for some reason now I can't get my sugars under control. No matter what I eat or do. Please can someone help me. Tell me what I should eat or do to bring my sugars under control. Oh and I am insulin dependent. I just want to get my sugars under control so that when I do try to get pregnant again. I will have a safe and wonderful pregnancy. Any advice will help tremendously. Thank you.",
