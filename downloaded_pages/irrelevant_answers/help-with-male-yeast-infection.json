Till today, it still comes and go regularly.However recently, the rash has been extremely persistent. I used several different cream prescribed by different doctors and pills too but it doesnt seem to be working.I had a urine test which tested negative for microbiological bacteria.Can anyone please advise me on what else other than yeast infection could i have possibly contracted? Or just that i need to change my medication.I have similar symptoms to yeast infection which are redness and itch. Several doctors i've seen have confirmed it to be yeast.But after so long and its still around, im beginning to worry.I have also tested negative for hiv and diabetes.I will greatly appreciate your kind assitance.Thank you.",
