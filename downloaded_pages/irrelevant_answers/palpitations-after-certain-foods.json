            "answer": "Hi!Well, oats contain gluten, so that can explain palpitations after you eat oats. Other than that many so called gluten free products contain hidden gluten in form of oats, barley, wheat, all purpose flour etc. So look out for that. Also you may have diabetes, so that needs to be ruled out. A food challenge test should be done to see whether you have food sensitivities or not. Take care!",

    "question": "I wonder if it is possible that my IBS problem involving gluten not only affects the gut, but also heartbeats?\u00a0\u00a0I have been eating quick oats for a while, in the belief that oats dont contain gluten, but maybe 15 mins after breakfast I start to get rapid heartbeat & a strange fluttering feeling in the stomach, + wanting to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I have substituted puffed millet for 2 days & the symptoms dont happen, but flavoured gluten free rice biscuits bring it on at lunch time!",
