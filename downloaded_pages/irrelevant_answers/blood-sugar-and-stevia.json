            "answer": "Any idea why the FDA considers Stevia an \"Unsafe food additive\"? http://www.fda.gov/ora/fiars/ora_import_ia4506.htmlBUT, these letters refute the FDA warninghttp://tinyurl.com/24r74ghttp://tinyurl.com/yozhvyFurther reading of the FDA report does not indicate why the FDA banned Stevia as a dietary sweetner. I Googled \"Stevia in Japan\" and discovered its wide use as a sweetning agent in many products, including Coca-Cola. From \"About, Toxic or Tasty\", http://tinyurl.com/yu6z9s\u00a0\u00a0\"Stevia has undergone numerous toxicity tests. None of these tests have shown any harmful effects. Few substances can make this claim. The real test, though, was centuries of continuous use by natives of South America. In addition, thousands of tons of stevia extracts have been consumed over the last 20 years in many countries with no harmful effects reported.\"It is unclear why the FDA banned Stevia in the first place. Is it politics from the Sugar industry as they have tried to ban Sucralose (Splenda)? I cold not locate any toxicology reports posted by the FDA. If it was a dangerous substance wouldn't there be a test report? I don't know. But, I too would like to hear from Stevia users, specifically diabetics.",

            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I'm type 2 diabetic and I've used stevia for several years and *love* it, and wish it were used in more products (it's starting to be, finally).I started off growing it... I had a big garden space, liked growing new things, and randomly saw the plant seeds listed in a seed catalog and description said something along the lines of \"leaves naturally extremely sweet, used for centuries as a sweetener\" so I figured why not try it... and wow, they weren't kidding; if you pull a leaf off the plant and put it in your mouth and chew it, the natural sweetness is shocking, almost wierd... the plant looks like a scraggly weed, kind of like a tall daisy without flowers, something you'd chop down or pull out of your garden without giving it a second thought.Anyway, I started researching it.\u00a0\u00a0Turned out it was being used extensively in Europe and Japan, including by Coca Cola and Pepsi because it was 'natural' and sweeter than sugar but had no carbs, no calories, and no known toxic side-effects.\u00a0\u00a0So why couldn't I find it in the USA?\u00a0\u00a0That remains a good question, and there are tons of conspiracy theories on the web about it [do a web search for \"monsanto and stevia\"], but not much of substance (meaning articles listing respectable research and authors) though the Wikipedia entry for Stevia has a nice summary of references:\u00a0\u00a0http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SteviaStevia *is* available as a powder, as a liquid, and in packets, but can not be sold in the USA as a \"sweetener,\" only as a \"dietary supplement\" so you can find it in vitamin stores and in the supplement sections of stores like Whole Foods, and online at Drugstore.com and Netrition.comIn my experience, pure stevia powder can be really bitter; the products that add a little sugar-alcohol (like erythritol) and especially for some reason some fiber (like inulin, which is just powdered chicory root) taste the best.\u00a0\u00a0Stevia has had *no* negative effect on my blood sugar, and it has been great to use to sweeten beverages and bland high-fiber cereal without having to use a chemical sweetener\u00a0\u00a0(you know, the blue packets, the yellow packets, or the pink packets)... give it a try.\u00a0\u00a0I personally like the \"SweetLeaf\" brand best.",

            "answer": "Oh, such a seemingly simple question...\u00a0\u00a0I've actually done quite a bit of baking experimentation; at the time I was diagnosed as diabetic one of my work responsibilities included overseeing a bakery operation... the bakers were enthusiastic about trying out 'diabetic' recipes (at first)... results were frustrating and mixed...SHORT ANSWER:bottom line, no dense flour-based baked good works well with any sugar-substitute, though many sugar substitutes work quite nicely with flourless tortes, chocolate and fruit based desserts, and lighter low-temp/shorter time baking recipes (angel food, etc)LONG ANSWER:Baking with Splenda:Regular Splenda:\u00a0\u00a0YUCK!\u00a0\u00a0I agree with your experience.\"Granulated\" Splenda for baking:\u00a0\u00a0not bad in terms of taste and consistency, but it raised my blood sugars as much as regular baked goods.\u00a0\u00a0Turns out the Splenda is \"granulated\" with maltodextrin (for my diabetic body, that's essentially sugar) which is derived from starch (corn, potato or wheat). So, granulated Splenda isn't a great sugar substitute to start with; you'd be better off just cutting the amount of sugar in half and probably having a better baking result anyhow.Other sugar substitutes:\"Granulated\" substitutes... same thing with all of them... they all are 'granulated'/fluffed (so they can be substituted 1:1 with regular sugar) with some form of actual sugar, so for this diabetic there's not much benefit.Fructose doesn't seem to raise blood sugar, but results were mixed in terms of taste and consistency. [plus the medical literature suggests some negative long-term effects for diabetics consuming derived fructose]Sugar alcohols:\u00a0\u00a0overall, no for high-temp or over 30-minute baking... inconsistent results, and when they did turn out well, they had a rather profound GI side-effect (gas, bloating, and laxative effect... ick!)\u00a0\u00a0plus they caused a delayed but significant rise in blood sugars.*Except* erythritol which does not seem to effect my blood sugar and doesn't cause GI problems for me, and bakes well, but it's a bit tricky to substitute for sugar because it's SO sweet and you need so little you have to figure out what to substitute for volume.Stevia:\u00a0\u00a0mixed results.\u00a0\u00a0Powder (white) forms are heat stable but tend to have a bitter after-taste in flour-based baked goods.\u00a0\u00a0The ground (green) form isn't as bitter when baked, but can add an unwanted green color and sometimes cause a granular consistency.\u00a0\u00a0Powder, ground, and liquid forms work well with non-flour baked goods like chocolate tortes and such.Bottom line:\u00a0\u00a0for baked goods like cakes and pastries (any sweet flour-based baked good) I think you're better off just limiting your portion size or having a bite of someone else's so you can enjoy the real thing; plus, having just a bite or small portion makes you really notice and appreciate the flavor and experience.... or, better yet, have some fruit with some powdered stevia sprinkled on it.\u00a0\u00a0 OR, experiment with low glycemic load / high-fiber flours... but that's another post entirely.",

However, they both affect my BUN (blood urea nitrogen) - causing it to max out or go above its max range - along with the tendency to leave me with excessive gas and feeling slightly bloated, that is, if I consume more than I should. I'm still experimenting with amounts. They both seem to lack the sweetness I desire. Perhaps its my sugar memories causing this.They say Erythritol is 70-80% the sweetness of sugar but to me its not. Have you ever mixed Erythritol & Stevia, or Maltitol & Stevia? If I could only find a way to reduce the Stevia bitter after taste...",
