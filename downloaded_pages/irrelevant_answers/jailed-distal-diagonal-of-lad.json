            "answer": "You have good left ventricle systolic functionality evidenced by your ejection fraction.\u00a0\u00a0Hypokinesis (impaired heart muscle movement) is minor and apparently not an issue.\u00a0\u00a0Slight MV and tricuspid regurg is not considered medically significant. Slight thickening of left vetrical wall is only an estimate of the dimension from the test and may be a condition worth monitoring?!When doing aerobic exercise it would be safe and beneficial for the heart to sustain a heart rate level (220 minus age less 10%) of 142 for at least 3 times a week for a 30 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Also, some resistance training for skeletal muscles is recommended.I would say, based on what you have written, you have a high probability of no heart issues for at least another 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0If you are really concerned there is the CT angiogram scan (64 slice) that provides images of\u00a0\u00a0vessel anatomy and views the plaque buildup, if any, between the lumen (endothelium cells) and outer layer of the vessels.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiologist's know that this plaque breaks throw the endothelium lining and cause heart attacks...the plaque buildup in the lumen is less risk for heart attack but does provide a risk for ischemia (lack of blood flow).\u00a0\u00a0The CT scan calculates the risk and provides the probability for a heart attack witrhin a year and longer.",

    "question": "I had a 28 mm Taxus stent implanted in April 2006I was doing well until a stress test found ischemia to anterior wall ; follow up cath showed good flow from LAD but ostial occulsion (70%) of the distal diagonal a 1.5 lesion.I am concerned about the possibility of an infarction.\u00a0\u00a0I exercise regularly at a gym and have my cholesterol under control and my plac tests are goodI show hypokinesis of the anterior wall on echo stress testing and some ST depression, good ejection fraction, slight mv and tricuspid regurg, and slight thickening of lvWhat are the chances of a infarction, how much exertion is too much, should an intervention be considered? I do have anginal pain (vague) I am a female 62 years old, no diabetes, hypertension, positive family hx, elevated Lpathank you",
