            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Numbness may be caused by an injury to a nerve, pressure on the spinal nerves/ peripheral nerves, lack of blood supply to an area, and other medical conditions such as carpal tunnel syndrome, diabetes, use of certain medications or vitamin deficiencies. The usual side effects of Azithromycin include diarrhea, chest pain, nausea, stomach pain, loss of appetite, dark urine, headache and red skin rash. Prednisone, on the other hand, may increase glucose levels, insomnia, or euphoria. The effects will resolve after the prescribed intake of medicine. However, if the numbness persists or other symptoms arise, it is best that you inform your doctor for proper management.Take care and best regards.",

            "answer": "Hi Kal,How are you? What diagnostic tests were done in the past? Losing sense of touch highly suggests neurological issues and\u00a0\u00a0may need to be checked by a neurologist for proper evaluation. Try to avoid eating spicy food, coffee, soda and skipping meals\u00a0\u00a0also since these can trigger stomach upsets. Erectile dysfunction becomes more common as you get older but further evaluation may need to be done also since it can be a sign of health problems such as clogged blood vessels, nerve damage from diabetes and other medical conditions. It is best that you see your doctor\u00a0\u00a0for proper evaluation. Direct clinical examiantion and additional diagnostic tests may need to be done.\u00a0\u00a0 Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hi, I have gradually lost my sense of touch in my whole body for the last four months. Took an MR scan of my head and back, also taken blood samples which show I do not have any vitamin deficiencies (although a slightly low level of vit D), or high blood pressure. The doctors cant seem to find out what causes it. For the last year I have had a sensitive stomach to alcohol and acidic food which causes my left upper stomach to feel uncomfortable. Could there be a link between my stomach and my numbness? Also took antibiotics two months before this started.",
