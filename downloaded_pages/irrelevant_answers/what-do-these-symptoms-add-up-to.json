            "answer": "The strong smelling, cloudy urine and sudden strong urge to urinate, indicate a watework infection.\u00a0\u00a0This can be anywhere from the kidneyes right down to the urethra.Make an appointment as soon as possible to see the doctor and take a sample of your urine.A really bad body odor can be caused by what you eat (for example garlic), or if you are not emptying your bowels regularly.As you do not exercise and have a sedentary lifestyle it sounds like your bowels are not regular.\u00a0\u00a0A 15 minute walk every day as well as eating a healthy and balance diet with plenty of fruit and veg and plenty of water 2-3 litres is usually the recommended norm) should help.If you are still having problems with regular bowels movements you may need to take something to help you go to the loo (not laxatives).Having a cloudy urine is nevery a good sign.\u00a0\u00a0And if it smells of kidneys or liver that definitely is a kidney infection that you have, even possibility of kidney stones.Get it examined asap.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Untreated diabetes gives you sugary urine (the old school test was for the doctor to taste-test it).\u00a0\u00a0You also drink and pee LOTS (polydipsia and polyuria).\u00a0\u00a0It also causes weight loss eventually if you don't have enough insulin to get your food to your cells.I agree with jemma that you should get checked for a UTI.\u00a0\u00a0A burning sensation while peeing can also indicate a UTI.\u00a0\u00a0Since you don't mention a fever, it's *probably* not as high up as the kidneys.I don't know about the body odor (unless maybe you've been eating extra garlic or something) or panic attacks.\u00a0\u00a0You should ask your doctor.",

            "answer": "Yeah, wouldn't want to do that taste test!\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, observant doctors used to diagnose diabetes in men by noticing little sugar crystals on the shoes (from the guys not aiming so well).Obesity is actually a risk factor for type 2 diabetes, not a symptom.\u00a0\u00a0As you said, people with not enough insulin or who are insulin resistant can't properly transfer sugar in the blood to the cells where it is needed.\u00a0\u00a0The body has to use fatty acids instead for fuel, so it actually burns the fat it has to keep going.\u00a0\u00a0Unchecked, this can lead to ketoacidosis as the ketones released by lipolysis (fat burning) for fuel turn the blood acidic (although full blown ketoacidosis is rare in type 2, since there is some insulin floating around).\u00a0\u00a0The ketogenic diet (lots of fat, regular protein, very low carb) exploits the same mechanism, but at a much lower level that doesn't turn the blood acidic.Sorry, the section of bio class that dealt with cell signalling used diabetes as a model to help us understand.\u00a0\u00a0And I just spent some time reading wikipedia articles on diabetes because, well, I'm just that nerdy.",
