    "question": "Looks like my baby boy was too anxious to meet everyone in this crazy world we live in. I was 33 weeks and had gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My water broke 2-6-15 around 8:30 am never had my water break on its own before so I was freaking out. Didn't really know what was going on. Came to hospital to be checked and sure enough it was. I hadn't dialated anymore than what I was before. 90% 1-2 cm.. after a few hours my contractions kept coming stronger and stronger. Never felt them in the front it was all back. I moved right along and ended up getting my epidural at 6 cm around 7 pm 5 minutes after having it it wouldn't take to my left side where all the pain was. 7:16 pm my handsome boy was born. Weighing 7 lbs even, yes very large for a 33 week baby but also gotta consider the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He is currently in the NICU on a CPAP machine to help him breath. Breaks my heart all I want to do is hold him and take him home with me, but looks like me will be here several weeks. For anyone with gestational diabetes I recommend take it very serious. Wish I would have a lot sooner than I did.",
