She had to moniter her diet (which she didn't do well, her mom had to step in for her and do that) She had to test herself a couple times a day.

            "answer": "there are many complications with gestational diabetes depending on how severe you have it.\u00a0\u00a0They will perform a glucose tolerance test on you to see your severity.\u00a0\u00a0you will drink this DELICIOUS (note the sarcasm) orange drink and they will draw your blood 1 hour later to measure how your body is tolerating it.My best friend had gestational diabetes with her son.\u00a0\u00a0She was insulin dependant for the rest of her pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Her son was born and was a 9 lb baby.\u00a0\u00a0You are at risk of having a larger than normal baby.\u00a0\u00a0Also, he was unable to regulate his sugar levels on his own so he spent the first 24 hours of his life in special care to monitor his sugar. (he was fine)\u00a0\u00a0Everything was normal after that and her Gestational Diabetes was gone.Good luck!!",

            "answer": "I have gd w/ this pregnancy. I am controlling it by diet and am pretty restricted to what I can eat.\u00a0\u00a0My sil has it in her pregnancy this time too but her numbers are so crazy that she has to inject insulin but she does get to eat more things than I do because the insulin is controlling her blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Either way they say a gd diet is good in pregnancy even if you dont have it because it constitutes a lot of veggies and proteins and not too many carbs and of course no junk food....although I have found lil things that I can have w/out having a bad number.\u00a0\u00a0The dangers involved if not controlled can be disproportionate weight gain for the baby and possible still birth.\u00a0\u00a0Its important so good you are getting it taken care of.\u00a0\u00a0good luck and I hope you dont have it.",
