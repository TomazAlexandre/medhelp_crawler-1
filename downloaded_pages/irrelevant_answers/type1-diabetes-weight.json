            "answer": "I sent you a message all about my treatment plan.But I just wanted to say that the only way I was able to manage the weight vs insulin situation was with the support of my healthcare team. So if you're Dr is not supporting you in wanting to lose weight there's something wrong with this relationship.The answer she gave you is absolutely unacceptable! Just because someone is diabetic does not mean they are going to automatically become overweight, and that you just have to live with it! That is such B.S.Is there another Dr. in your area you can work with? Is the person treating your diabetes a general practitioner or an endocrinologist? There's got to be options for you.If your diabetes is being well maintained and managed there's no reason you should experience major weight fluctuations. Some fluctuations are normal when first making adjustments, but things should balance out and if a patient is unhappy with their weight and expressing that to their Dr, they should be helping you make the appropriate changes.This is part of the reason we see things like diabetic anorexia, or people reverting to pills etc. These are not healthy weight loss techniques and will only make you suffer in the long run.I hope you can find some useful information here, but keep in mind that without the proper care of a good Dr. it is going to be hard to get the results you want. Diabetes is a complex disease and it is unique in each individual.I'd recommend working with a certified diabetes educator, if you can find one in your area. They can work with you on a weekly or bi-weekly basis to help get your program tailored to your specific needs. You can also call them anytime with questions. As it's often difficult to get into the see the Dr that often or to talk with them on the phone about problems you may be having, a diabetes educator and really make a difference in your diabetes management.Take care!",
