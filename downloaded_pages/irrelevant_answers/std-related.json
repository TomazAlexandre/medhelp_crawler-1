    "question": "I had protected sex like 2 months ago and I started to feel a tingle sensation then it went and my penis went numb and still is. I used to have an erection ever hour and now I only get it when I watch porn or when I wake up. My foreskin is dry aswell and I'm really worried if I have std and I'd hate to go doctors. Do you think it's std related?",
