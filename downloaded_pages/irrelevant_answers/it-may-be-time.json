    "question": "I just got back from my weekly non-stress test\u00a0\u00a0(weekly because of gestational diabetes). I am having regular contractions and have been for a few hours. They are about 3 1/2-4 1/2 minutes apart! Yesterday I was 4 cm dilated and 80% effaced. I am 37 weeks 5 days. My doctor aloud me to leave the hospital so that I could get my son off to the babysitters. I will be going back to the hospital, most likely tonight.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, doctors cannot break your waters before 39 weeks. Well since I am before 39 weeks, do I have to wait until it breaks on its own?\u00a0\u00a0I mean, what happens when I am 10 cm and 100% effaced and the water is still intact? They have to break it then, don't they????",
