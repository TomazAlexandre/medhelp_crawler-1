You have to be count the amount of carbs eaten daily not restricting carbs with Diabetics. Suggest see a Registered Dietitian in your area so your grandfather gets a meal plan he can follow.

    "question": "Hi, so my Grandpa has Diabetes, High Blood Pressure. Kidney problems and on occasion if he eats things such as red meat or nuts gets gout.This really restricts his diet alot, and he's always hungry because he restricts his diet so much because he's afraide either his blood sugar will go to high or his foot will start hurting from gout, or he'll damage his kidneys....So what can he eat that is some how balanced, low in carbs (diabetes), low protein (kidneys), and won't cause uric acid build up, as well as low sodium for his high blood pressure?",
