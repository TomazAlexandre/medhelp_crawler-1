If I sleep for a short period of time and suddenly wake I will have those internal tremors and visually see them too for up to a minute. It's frightening really. Ugh, I hate those arrogant docs who think if they don't know what is wrong with you it's in your head. Sorry you are having problems and that I have no answers eitherDon",
