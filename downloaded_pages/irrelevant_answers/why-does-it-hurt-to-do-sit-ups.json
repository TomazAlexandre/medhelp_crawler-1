            "answer": "It actually hurts after only a couple sit-ups, in the muscles right below my ribcage. It isn't a stabbing pain or anything, but it does hurt in a more than uncomfortable way. I just feel normal fatigue when I do crunches, so I don't know why sit-ups are different except that maybe they work the muscles more where I use to have a hernia.",

            "answer": "Also, I have talked to a doctor before about it, it was back in 7th grade when I was being diagnosed with diabetes. He said my muscles just didn't connect right when I was little because of the hernia, but he said it doesn't feel like i still have one or that it was dangerous.",

    "question": "When I was little I had a hernia about 2 or 3 inches below where\u00a0\u00a0my xiphoid process is. It wasn't a problem so we never got it fixed, but ever since i started gym in school it hurts there when I do more than 3 sit-ups (my muscles don't feel tired until i do about 10, and I don't have a issue with doing small crunches, just sit-ups) . I had a doctor tell me in 7th grade (I'm 20 now)\u00a0\u00a0that my muscles weren't connected right around that part of my abdomen. Could that be why sit-ups hurt me after only a couple of them?",
