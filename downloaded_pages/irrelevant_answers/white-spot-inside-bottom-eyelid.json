            "answer": "If your pink eye (conjunctivitis) is improving then I don't think you need worry now.\u00a0\u00a0A membranous conjunctivitis is a severe problem and the membranes are huge and yellow-white sheets along the upper and lower membrane.\u00a0\u00a0You could be seeing a white collection of oil like material called a concretion that frequently form along the back surface of the upper and lower eyelid. They usually have a smooth coat over them and don't hurt or cause problems.If the area becomes painful, swollen or irritating go back for the Ophthalmologist (Eye MD) to re-examine. If you heal completely and the eye feels fine don't worry. With your diabetes you need to see an Eye MD every year. Next visit ask the Eye MD physician what it is.JCH III MD",
