            "answer": "Another cause of white spots all over the brain MRI can be small vessel ischemic disease, usually caused by high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, sometimes migraines, etc.\u00a0\u00a0As they asked me, do you take aspirin daily?Oops, by all over the brain MRI, did he say it was in the white matter of the brain?If it were me, I would ask the doc what he though the possible causes might be.The white matter does usually show some spots as we age, sometimes a few in the 40s, more in the 50s,\u00a0\u00a0more so in the 60s and up.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor says they are \"all over\" and he wants to figure out for sure what's causing them, he must have some ideas in mind, or he would simply write them off as \"normal for aging\" as many doctors do.Has he scheduled any tests?\u00a0\u00a0When do you see him again?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you could make a list of questions you would like to have answered (it helps me!) the next time you see him.Take care",
