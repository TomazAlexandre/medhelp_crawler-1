            "answer": "she is not urinating frequently no diabetes. # 1 symptom. Always because the body will suck out every bit of moisture in the body to eliminate all extra sugar. Severe onset at this age almost always occurs. Have a pediatrician give her a long acting glucose evaluation test. Love and communication will calm her down.",

    "question": "My 9 year old may be showing a few signs of juvenile diabetes, such as headaches, fatigue, behavioral changes/mood swings, persistant hunger; sometimes she's sweaty, then can quickly become very cold.\u00a0\u00a0Bouts of blurry vision and \"itchy\" sensations during her temperment changes.\u00a0\u00a0Daily feelings of nausea (always early morning pre-meal and just before bed), particularly over the last month.\u00a0\u00a0Sleep at night seems to be relatively undisturbed.\u00a0\u00a0She drinks alot, but does not urinate frequently.\u00a0\u00a0She can look pale at times, but is fair skinned and this makes it difficult to always tell.\u00a0\u00a0We have not yet seen the pediatrician, but do know that her paternal grandmother died of diabetes, which has recently come to our attention and is raising some concerns.\u00a0\u00a0Are there common symptoms in children with juvenile diabetes prior to a meal, such as irritability and being \"cantakerous\", yet experience a sudden mood swing with a meal or just post meal, becoming pleasant and controllable?\u00a0\u00a0We are considering having her tested for diabetes, but want to be certain by verifying her \"symptoms\" with those common in juvenile diabetes.",
