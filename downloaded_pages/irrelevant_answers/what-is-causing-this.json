            "answer": "Fruity smelling urine has several causes. What you didn't tell us is how your glucose levels are currently so its difficult to say if uncontrolled/unmanaged diabetes is playing large role in this. When glucose levels are excessive blood sugars are passed to the kidneys which in turn spill them out in the urine. If you breath has a fruity smell you need to see a doctor asap. Although rare in t2 diabetics, the possibility of diabetic ketoacidosis, a life threatening complication, may have surfaced. Get off the computer and call your doctor now. Good luck",
