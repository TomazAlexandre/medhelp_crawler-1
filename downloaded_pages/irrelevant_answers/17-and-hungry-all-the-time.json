This is what were all told when attending weight watching clubs.\u00a0\u00a0And that is the advice they gave was to have a drink and wait 20 minutes before having something healthy to eat.It is possible that he may be going through a growth spurt.\u00a0\u00a0I don't really exactly at what age growing stops, but each child/teenager is different.If he was feeling hungry and losing weight and felt ill then I would be worried.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Increased appetite could a sign of low blood sugar, diabetes, depression and anxiety. Diabetes can be ruled out since you have checked his sugar and there seems to be no problem with his blood sugar since he is active. Check his emotional state. If he is happy as before and does not experience mood swings and isnt under the influence of any intoxicants then any sort of depression can be ruled out. The only thing that i can advice right now, is a thyroid test. If his thyroid levels are okay, then you can relax. Its his growing body thats demanding more nutrition and he feels hungry all the time.",
