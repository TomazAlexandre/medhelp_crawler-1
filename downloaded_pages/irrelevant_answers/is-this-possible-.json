            "answer": "Dear K,Certainly without being able to examine you or to get more history, it is difficult for me to tell you what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0I think that there are two things going on here, though.\u00a0\u00a0The first is that you probably have syncope, which is passing out, or at least near-syncope (almost passing out).\u00a0\u00a0There are lots of reasons for this, but the most common that I see amongst teenagers is the fact that they do not adequately keep their tank full of fluid.\u00a0\u00a0I do recommend that you make sure that you are well hydrated, even if you don\u2019t feel thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0You should probably have four 8-12 ounce glasses of fluid (milk, water, juice) and a salty snack to keep your blood pressure up.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you should not skip meals and you should eliminate caffeine (sodas, tea, coffee, energy drinks), as it is a diuretic and will make you urinate fluid back out.\u00a0\u00a0If this persists despite these interventions, though, you should probably see your doctor again.The other think going on is your family history.\u00a0\u00a0You should know that there are controllable risk factors:\u00a0\u00a0diabetes, cigarette smoking, hypertension (high blood pressure), and high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0There is also some research that suggests that being overweight and lack of exercise MAY contribute to a heart attack, as well.\u00a0\u00a0Thus, just because you have a family history of coronary artery disease, the problem that eventually leads to a heart attack, does not mean that you are destined to have it.\u00a0\u00a0You can take control of this yourself and prevent it.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you are rather slim, so your risk for acquired diabetes is low.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully you are active, doing aerobic exercise on a routine basis.\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t smoke.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that your blood pressure is normal at your routine doctor visits.\u00a0\u00a0As far as frozen/processed foods, many of them have lots of chemicals and salt, or high amounts of fat to make them tasty.\u00a0\u00a0I don\u2019t recommend routine nutrition with them.\u00a0\u00a0You need to move on to having more fruits and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0If brown is the only color of your food (bread, cereal, cooked meat, etc.), then you need to expand the colors to more greens, reds, purples, and other foods.\u00a0\u00a0They do taste good, if they\u2019re prepared well\u2014really.\u00a0\u00a0There are some good cookbooks out that can help you or whoever is making your meals make fast, healthy, and tasty things.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, the more you get used to eating like that, the better that you actually feel.",

            "answer": "I am not a doctor by any means I just want to wish you good luck. you seem to have a lot on your plate at such a young age. I hope someone can help take care of you, especially to hep you out with your stress. stress in itself, from what I understand isn't good, especially for someone your age. In my opinion, whom\u00a0\u00a0ever is responsible for your care, might be able to have a complete exam, not just for diabetes, but other things to help rule out things so you don't have to go around with the stress like this. you should be able to enjoy life at 13 and not have to have this burden on your shoulders.Good luck and I hope you can get some answers some where.michelle",

            "answer": "I am not a doctor.Genetics come into play later down the line when you are 35 and older, depending on your family history.\u00a0\u00a0What you eat can affect it, but again it takes a while before the damage accumulates to the point where it's a problem.\u00a0\u00a0I would work on handling your stress better, eating better ( you won't feel as crappy) and keeping hydrated.\u00a0\u00a0There may be someone at school that can help you mange the stress if you're not comfortable with asking your parents.",

    "question": "dear doctor, I am 13 years young, and my dad had a heart attack. I now realize I am at risk and am fighting genitics both ways, mother, and father. my mothers father died from CGF, and my father hada heart attack january of 08'. Since I was 8 or 9, I have been experiencing dizzy spells. which include, fainting, nausea, blurred vision, and this terrible stomach pain, like I have to vomit. 2 of these spells, I have actually fallen, and another one, I broke glass, and injured myself. I am quite scared. I am wondering if the signs point to anemia, Low blood sugar, or a possible heart problem. I wonder if its a heart problem because of genitics, stress, and my diet, ( I am 4'9, slender, 90-95 lb) is terrible, mostly boxed, and frozen foods, as I refuse to eat healthy. any ideas? I have been to doctors. they have ruled out diabetes.",
