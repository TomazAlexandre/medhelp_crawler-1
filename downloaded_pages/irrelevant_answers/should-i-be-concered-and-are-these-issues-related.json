            "answer": "When did you last have your blood pressure checked?\u00a0\u00a0If you have very low blood pressure this can cause the problems from sitting to standing.\u00a0\u00a0This is one avenue you can explore.\u00a0\u00a0I am not entirely familiar with your medications but there could also be side effects from these.\u00a0\u00a0If you have polycysic ovarian sydrome, as you may know you are at increased risk from diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So you need to have yourself checked for this regularly.\u00a0\u00a0Alongside this is the risk of peripheral vascular disease, which means the blood supply to your extremities can be interrupted, which will cause numbness.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively there may be an entirely unrelated issue causing these symptoms, and you may need input from a neurologist. Basically in answer to your question my advice is yes, tell your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe if they are open minded even suggest some of the above.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor is good and knows you well they may have the answer to the best way forward.\u00a0\u00a0Don't ever be put off seeking help because you think a problem is too trivial.\u00a0\u00a0Particularly with your diagnoses, there is no problem which you should ignore.\u00a0\u00a0So please get help, get your blood pressure checked, get your blood sugar levels checked, and then see if these yield answers or you need to look on to specialist referrals.\u00a0\u00a0Wish you good health and let us know if you get a result!",

            "answer": "Thank you for the information.\u00a0\u00a0Actually my blood pressure is usually pretty low to average.\u00a0\u00a0I just had it checked about 2 weeks ago and it was 119 over 40, but I checked it right after a workout.\u00a0\u00a0I have always had issues with low blood pressure so I am definitely going to look into that.\u00a0\u00a0I was also unaware of peripheral vascular disease, but I did know about the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have my sugar and thyroid levels checked so often that I am on a first name basis with my phlebotomist.\u00a0\u00a0I see an endocrinologist on a regular basis.\u00a0\u00a0She is person who diagnosed me with the thyroid and the PCOS issue.I went ahead and set up a doc appointment for tomorrow at 4:30.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure I will get sent to a specialist, because I have to first see a general practitioner, before I can get a referral.\u00a0\u00a0I will keep you updated and thanks again for the information.",

    "question": "In the past 2-3 weeks, I have been experiencing an issue with dizziness and faintness when standing up.\u00a0\u00a0It is usually when I have been sitting for more than 2 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0When I stand up I have to hold on to something not to lose my balance.\u00a0\u00a0I feel weak almost like I am having issues with my blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for diabetes a couple weeks ago and I am in the good range.\u00a0\u00a0I am also having issues with numbness in my right foot.\u00a0\u00a0It is to the point where I am stumbling and I am having issues wearing my dress shoes.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if these issues are remotely related, but my health is better than it has ever been otherwise.In January, I weighed 267 pounds and as of today I weigh 216.4 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0 I am eating really healthy, no drinking, and exercising at least 5 times a week if not more.\u00a0\u00a0I am a smoker, but I smoke about 8-10 cigarettes a day (so about a half a pack).\u00a0\u00a0I get enough sleep as well.\u00a0\u00a0I am currently on 1500mg of Metformine a day for Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Then I take .5 of Synthroid one day a week and .25 six days a week.\u00a0\u00a0I do have an issue with my thryoid, which is the reason I am taking the Synthroid.My overall question is:\u00a0\u00a0Should I see a doctor about these issues?\u00a0\u00a0or are they something I can just overlook?\u00a0\u00a0I hate going to the doctor for no reason, but I injured my foot last night because it feel asleep after a minute and half of not moving it.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone please help me?\u00a0\u00a0Any incite would be wonderful.",
