            "answer": "Hello,Blood in the urine can present in one of two ways: gross hematuria (blood that you can see in the urine), and microscopic hematuria (blood that is only seen when the urine is examined under a microscope). Both types can have serious causes. If you are passing different-shaped clots in your stream, they could represent bleeding from the urethra or prostate (in men). Clots can be wormlike, and if associated with pain it could represent clots coming from your ureters(tubes from your kidneys to your bladder).When the blood in the urine is at the beginning of urination, it most likely comes from the urethra, (the tube from the bladder to the outside). Blood throughout urination is most likely from the bladder or kidneys or ureters (the tubes connecting the kidneys and the bladder). Bloating is the body's response to fluid level disturbance which is common after a kidney disease.Diagnostic tests that may be performed include Urinalysis, Urine culture, X-rays of the kidneys, Cystoscopy, IVP, Abdominal ultrasound and CT scan of the abdomen.Pls consult a urologist for this.I hope it helps.Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well if you have not been over eating or consuming high calories and exercising less or if there is no change in your routine or if there is no new medication that you have started, or you do not have diabetes, hypothyroidism or adrenal gland problems, then you do have unexplained weight gain. This along with blood in urine should be seriously looked into.One possibility is that the two are not related. In such a case the reasons for blood in urine have already been given to you. Weight gain can occur due to the causes mentioned above.The other possibility is that the two are related.The commonest condition that can cause weight gain with kidney damage is diabetes mellitus. Undiagnosed, untreated and poorly controlled DM has these features.Also if you have gained weight due to some reason and are exercising strenuously to lose weight, you can have blood in urine. This will go once you condition yourself to exercising. Also if you are taking medications like laxatives to reduce weight then there is a chance that you may get blood in urine. Women in menopausal age group do tend to gain weight due to hormonal changes and need an assessment by a gynecologist. (Assuming you belong to fairer sex)Another one is Lupus nephritis, seen in people with SLE. This can cause both weight gain and blood in urine.Good Pasture\u2019s syndrome is another possibility with weight gain due to water retention with blood in urine due to kidney damage.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
