            "answer": "It is obvious from your post that you are in need of diabetes education. You can obtain this from your doctor, or by carefully reading the information available on various diabetes web sites.Only a doctor should advise you of medication dosage/s as he/she has access to your medical records and history. Accepting this type of advice from a stranger on a public health forum/board can put your life at risk, especially with insulin. A preprandial glucose level of 120 mg/dl does not warrant insulin. Good luck",

            "answer": "Hello,as important as the preprandial (yours is higher than it should be - it should be < 95 ideally before eating), even more important is what happens after eating.Blood sugar should also be tested about 2 hours after eating.the correct insulin dose is calculated in coordination with your doctor and has to be based on the amount of carbohydrate and protein you eat as well as how high your blood sugars may get and how much one unit of insulin drops your blood sugar.Please discuss with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Please request some education on how to use insulin.It is dangerous to use insulin if one does not fully understand how it works.\u00a0\u00a0OF course high blood sugars are also unhealthy.Hope this gives you some more direction.",
