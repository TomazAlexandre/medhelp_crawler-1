            "answer": "Were you tested for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Having PCOS puts you at risk for diabetes, and the numbness in the hands and feet sounds like peripheral neuropathy. I am surprised you were not put on metformin or glucophage for the PCOS. These drugs are used to restore normal menstrual cycles in PCOS sufferers and also keep blood sugar levels down.You're on a lot of Hypertension meds!

For that you'd need some kidney tests, like an ultrasound to see if you have any cysts, vascular stenosis, etc.Good luck, I hope you feel better.",
