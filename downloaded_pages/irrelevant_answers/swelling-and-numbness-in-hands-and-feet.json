            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The swelling and numbness in both hands and feet could be due to water retention causing pressure on the nerves as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, severe anemia etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms.I think you should discuss this with your doctor. Also you may need to get some tests done. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
