            "answer": "Thanks for your reply.I guess I should be a bit more specific. I only see waxy-ish vision at night and at a distance.\u00a0\u00a0intermediate and near vision seem good but it does seem as if there might be a small film in my field of view.\u00a0\u00a0I can see 20/20 for both my computer and t.v but I hit J5 and maybe 20/30.\u00a0\u00a0These values change from day to day.\u00a0\u00a0One day it seems I can hit 20/20 and maybe J6 and then J4 but 20/60.\u00a0\u00a0I am all over the map.My surgeon said research in Florida shows that, PCO or not, fibrosis will eventually cause the CL to loose accommodative ability.\u00a0\u00a0I talked to another doc and he said the lens needs the Yag to settle.Since this is the final step, I was just wondering if other CL patients experience this lack of \"crystal\" vision...especially at night and if the Yag improved it.Thanks",

My remaining cataract is much smaller than the one in the left eye.\u00a0\u00a0 I really liked the retina surgeon, and had the impression that he wouldn't hesitate to assert his opinion, even if it differed somewhat from my cataract surgeon, with whom he has a close association!",

I work hard to exercise those eye muscles and practice the distance focusing, but it's very frustrating and disappointing. I'm hopeful with these comments that it will improve as I really do LOVE the near and intermediate 20/20 sight, and the beautiful colors I see now. I'm very thankful my left eye has decent distance vision, and am going to postpone my other cataract surgery in three weeks until this eye improves.",

    "question": "This is more a qualitative question to those that have had the lens implanted than a medical question. I had the HD lens implanted two and a half months ago and my distance vision is waxy.\u00a0\u00a0I measured 20/20 on that so accurate Snellen chart (how many fingers do you see? ...3.. ok your good).\u00a0\u00a0At night, well lets just say thank God it is my non-dominant eye or I would be Mr. Magoo on steroids.I hope I can throw all the blame on the whipping boy called PCO.\u00a0\u00a0If not, I guess I'm up the creek without a paddle.\u00a0\u00a0My doc wants to do the Yag ...if nothing else as a method to allow the lens to flex and groan under my ciliary muscles gallant attempts to reach clarity.The Yag will be done at 3.5 months.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone tell me if they had the waxy vision and how long it took to see it disappear and did the Yag really clear that up?\u00a0\u00a0If this wax clears up, I would be a happy camper but the jury is still out on this one.Thanks",
