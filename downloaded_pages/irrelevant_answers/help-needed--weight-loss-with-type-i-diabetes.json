            "answer": "Does she have a buffalo hump on the top of her spine, where the spine meets the neck?The areas where you say she has weight gain can occur with high cortisol levels - cortisol comes from the adrenal glands that sit on top of the kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0I've also read that PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) can mimic high cortisol weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0PCOS is associated with carbohydrate intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0It's possible the South Beach diet isn't restrictive enough for her.\u00a0\u00a0She might need Atkins.\u00a0\u00a0But I wouldn't do that diet unless the doctor ok's it because of her type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 Gluten, which is in wheat, barley, rye and possibly oats, might be something for her to eliminate.\u00a0\u00a0It helped my daughter lose weight - and she never overate to begin with.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there!",
