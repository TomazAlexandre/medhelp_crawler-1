Not all Dr's are up to date in regards to HIV unless they are specializing in something HIV related such as maybe working in an STD clinic or involved in research etc.For the question of insertive anal, yes alot of guys do this to women.\u00a0\u00a0It is a higher risk they say, and mainly because the penis is directly exposed to blood in the anus/rectum.\u00a0\u00a0The bum is not meant for inserting items into and is made of thin delicate tissue that easily \"tears\".\u00a0\u00a0So, with blood exposure, the chances are higher for transmission.\u00a0\u00a0Still, receptive anal is by far the most efficient method, other than needle sharing, for HIV transmission.\u00a0\u00a0This has been known since the 80's.Vaginal fluids have been shown to contain less infectious concentrations than blood or semen.\u00a0\u00a0that combined with the penis is built to keep things out for the most part, and there is a small opening for hiv to get in to, it makes the risks very low.\u00a0\u00a0This is not something funding lobbyists want anyone to hear and they certainly do not want to hear that there is no epidemic in north America at all.It;s all bizness now, not about saving lives and prevention.",

And yeah, I do agree that many doctors -- i.e. general practitioners who might not have a vested interest in STD research -- don't appear to be well-versed with the newer testing procedures. My GP, when she first tested me (two weeks ago -- at a month, due to anxiety) insisted that I should test out to six months. That really freaked me out and made me question her opinion, because, I mean, what? Six months? When I questioned her on it, she admitted that she hadn't really done any research before my visit. Awesome, doc! Thanks for your due diligence!On a side note, I read one of your messages about a needle in your belly -- dunno what that means or what it is, but I hope you are doing well.",

At one point, an Australian man who got tested at the 6-week mark (which the man said was conclusive in Australia) asked Dr. Bob if his test was conclusive. Dr. Bob's response -- rather than saying something like \"Yeah, Australia has some of the leading STD clinics in the world, so they probably know what they're talking about\" simply responds with \"Well, in the States, we have a three-month conclusive window.\" It's like reading from a script. And then Dr. Bob said something about kookaburras, and how not all areas are as lucky as Australia in having the latest generation of HIV tests. What? Dr. HHH has repeatedly said that generation doesn't make a large difference.Maybe he's just being conservative. I have no idea.",

I think what I don't completely get is why Massachusetts and Australia allegedly have the six-week conclusive testing period if so many other areas dispute it. I mean, wouldn't there be legal repercussions if people started testing positive after six weeks despite being told that six weeks was conclusive in these areas? I could envision those people saying \"Well, the doctors at the clinics in Aussie said I was fine at six weeks.

Went to an STD clinic to talk to one of the doctors there -- these guys deal with HIV on a regular basis, as the area the clinic is located in is a pretty high HIV-concentrated area. I spoke to one of the doctors -- a very knowledgable one -- about my fears, Medhelp, the window period, blah blah. I also told her I got a 1-month test, and she looked at me and immediately said \"Honestly, if your 1 month came back negative, it's extremely likely that you are negative and that it will not change.\"I then went on to quiz her about the 6-week testing procedure that Doc HHH recommends, and she completely agreed with it. When asked about the 3-month window, she ducked the question, but hinted that it was a CYA thing on the behalf of the CDC.So hopefully that'll give some hope to people out there. 6 weeks is considered pretty solid by many experts, but I guess the 3-month conclusive really isn't going anywhere soon.",
