            "answer": "You have a fungal infection by the sounds of things.When you wash do not use soaps, shower gels or feminine sprays.\u00a0\u00a0These will cause dryness and also change the pH level of your skin.You can see your doctor who can take a swab, or by your symptoms may prescribe an antifungal cream and/or give you a prescription for a one dose oral capsule.You can buy these over the counter from the pharmacy.\u00a0\u00a0The cream that you require is called Canesten and the oral one dose capsule is called Fluconazole.\u00a0\u00a0The Fluconazole costs around \u00a310 in the UK.\u00a0\u00a0 The doctor can prescribe stronger creams on prescription if the Cansten does not work.As a home remedy, apply natural live set yogurt to your sore area after washing with water and gently drying.Your boyfriend may also need to be treated even if he does not have any symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor will be able to advise you on this.If you are overweight, losing some weight will help with regard to the sweating between the legs.\u00a0\u00a0Only wear cotton underwear and use a non biological washing detergent.\u00a0\u00a0If you suffer from diabetes or glucose intolerance, make sure that this is well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0If you have a diet that consists of a lot of sugar, cutting down will help too.If you are experiencing itching frequently down below, it may be worth your doctor to take a blood test to check your sugar levels.Best wishes.",
