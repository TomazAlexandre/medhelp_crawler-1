            "answer": "Let me say first, that I know how you feel about taking all those pills. Prior to being diagnosed with diabetes my medication included many of the same meds you take with the addition of a beta-blocker. In 1998 by fasting glucose level was 117, a little high but no biggy. Eighteen months later my glucose level was 418 and a cardiac catherization revealed numerous blockedges in my coronary arteries due to my untreated diabetes. I subsequently had to undergo triple bypass heart surgery. Since you already have in your words \"hypertension, elevated cholesterol and heart issues\" untreated diabetes could either kill or severely cripple you.If you have doubts about your diagnoses contact an endocrinologist (sp?) and if indicated take your pills.Take Care of Yourself,troytroy",

            "answer": "Well you have to think of diabetes on a continuum with hypoglycemia on one end and hyperglycemia on the other.\u00a0\u00a0You need to be in the middle, but apparently your body was/is releasing too much insulin, making you hypoglycemic.\u00a0\u00a0But with so much insulin hitting the cells the cells become resistant which means type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you are on medication your cells will not be so resistant (if you are on metformin which I think is the only medication that works for insulin resistance) and you will sometimes drop too low if you do not eat right (I mean eating the right amount of carbs at meals and regularly not necessarily eating healthy).I would give the medications a try even though it is hard to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0I had to start with real low doses and work my way up.\u00a0\u00a0Usually if you give it enough time you will get used to it and won't get so sick.\u00a0\u00a0Don't think of it as a life long pill though.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 diabetes is usually reversible so if your weight is under control and your diet figured out you might not even need the pills, but for now it is better to do whatever you can to prevent it from getting out of control (take that from someone who ended up going blind).\u00a0\u00a0i'm sure a pill is worth it in comparison to one day possibly losing your vision, right?Also, when it comes to diet try to stay away from refined foods.\u00a0\u00a0Stick with whole grains and high fiber which helps regulate blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0People don't realize how important that is but if you start reading labels you will be shocked at how much refined flours and sugar is in EVERYTHING. No wonder type 2 diabetes is an epidemic!\u00a0\u00a0Sugar has many other names on labels that people don't recognize.Anyway, watching your diet is crucial because at this point with extra insulin being produced by your pancreas anything you eat (with the help of the medication) the insulin will store it for energy which makes it really easy to put on weight.\u00a0\u00a0If you start to put on too much weight the insulin resistance gets worse and then not only do you have to battle diabetes but you have to battle weight problems.\u00a0\u00a0So do what you can now.hope that helps.",

            "answer": "Me967~I think you might be able to control it with diet alone.\u00a0\u00a0Your blood sugar is really only too high 2-4 hours after you eat so if you paid attention to eating smaller portions and eating about the same level of carbs per meal you might be able to control it that way. bear in mind too that if your body is producing too much insulin that will trigger hunger and that's where many type 2's gain weight making their problem worse.\u00a0\u00a0I think a class would be great, honestly I think even non-diabetics could benefit by being educated more than they are, if at all.\u00a0\u00a0You might look up exchange lists too they are much easier to follow than the glycemic diet (although a list of low glycemic foods is good to follow).\u00a0\u00a0I personally think exchanges are easier and less time consuming than trying to figure out the glycemic load of foods.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/diabetes-diet/DA00077Aml74~It's my understanding that glucose intolerance and diabetes are th same thing (although there may be other medical conditions that exist that also cause intolerance I believe they are all diabetes related somehow...that includes hypoglycemis which is the opposite end of what we typically label \"diabetic\").\u00a0\u00a0Depending on how intolerant (resistant) you are you may still be in the pre-diabetic stage where your blood sugar is higher than it should be, usually after meals.\u00a0\u00a0Your fasting level should indicate whether or not the resistance is to the point of needing medication or insulin shots in some cases.\u00a0\u00a0The blood sugar after a meal shows your body is not using the insulin as quickly as it should so it is important to watch your intake of carbohydrates (including fruits and starchy vegetables) and portion sizes to prevent any further problems.The problems with type 2 diabetes is that most times th e body is still making insulin so a a fasting blood sugar won't tell much (for instance Me967 was still in the normal range).\u00a0\u00a0So a glucose tolerance test has to be done to tell whether or not the cells are getting the glucose.\u00a0\u00a0If the blood sugar is too high after a meal then the glucose is still floating around in the blood stream and not getting to the cells as it should. The pancreas will keep pumping out insulin so eventually it goes back down to a normal level and that explains why it's not uncommon for people to be a type 2 diabetic for years and not know it.Hope that helps",

So, you are on the right track :)ttyl~Lacey",
