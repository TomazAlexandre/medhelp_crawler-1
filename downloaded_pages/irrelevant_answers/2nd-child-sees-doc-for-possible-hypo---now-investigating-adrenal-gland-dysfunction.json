            "answer": "The adrenal gland sits on top of the kidneys, and part of its hormone function comes from the pituitary gland, which is also where the thyroid gets its hormone messages also.Often times when some part of the adrenal gland is not right, then the thyroid levels can be off as well.She's checking thyroid function with the TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone, which is the pituitary gland one) Free T3 and Free T4 (both are the usuable hormone from the thyroid) and the thyroid antibodies, are to see if she has an autoimmune disease which might be attacking the thyroid.The glucose is to check for diabetes. Diabetes is also a pituitary gland dysfunction.Prolactin is released also from the pituitary gland.B12 is often low in thyroid patients.HbA1c is another test for diabetes.The ferrutub (ferritin) and CBC are to check for anemia.The rest are for checking the adrenal gland function. Some part of the adrenal gland can release too much of one hormone and this is not part of the pituitary gland but most message to the adrenal gland comes from the pituitary, and these tests can prove that.If very low levels are found it is known as Adrenal insufficiency and if left untreated is quite serious. If high levels are found then it can mean a tumour or lesion and would need treatment accordingly.If any of the adrenal tests come back abnormal, they will usually run a series of more tests known as ACTH stim test. This is done by having the patient tested before the stimulation test then usually 30 and 60 minutes later. If the levels are skewed after that then treatment is done. There are quite a few issues related to adrenal problems and too involved to list here, but I hope that gives you some idea.",

            "answer": "thanks for the feedback.\u00a0\u00a0I guess at this point I need to live in the moment and not worry about the results of the tests until they come back. It's hard for me to do that.\u00a0\u00a0I keep searching stuff on adrenal issues but because I don't know which problem they might be checking for, I just read scary stuff and get scared.Is it bizarre to have a mom and a daughter both diagnosed with graves within 4 months and then the other daughter having gland issues as well?\u00a0\u00a0I think I will drink lots of wine this holiday season!",

    "question": "Update - saw endocrinologist and daughter is now being treated for graves. No uptake scan because the doc said that is the definitive diagnostic tool but only needed if rai is being considered and she doesn't do rai in young girls.\u00a0\u00a0Started propanolol and tapezole.\u00a0\u00a0Another episode of blinding headache and dizziness last night but were able to treat with tylenol and ibuprofen. It breaks my heart that she will have to deal with graves for possibly a lifetime.\u00a0\u00a0I know there are many worse things to get and I keep telling myself this is manageable and treatable and we'll al be fine.2nd child saw endo.\u00a0\u00a0She does not feel there are thyroid issues.\u00a0\u00a0Her feeling is that there is something whonky with the adrenal gland. She has ordered the following tests:glucose, HbA1C, TSH, Creatinine, sodium, potassium, cloride, VB12, Ferrutub, CBC, thyroid antibodies, am cortisol, ACTH, DHEAS, Free T3 , Free T4, prolactin, and a 24 hour unrine for free cortisol.She was pretty vague in what she was looking for.\u00a0\u00a0Is the adrenal gland associated with the thyroid gland? Any idea what she might be looking for based on these tests?\u00a0\u00a0I will be so happy when we stop having to navigate the medical world.\u00a0\u00a0We've been lucky to have great people helping us.",
