            "answer": "Hi,How is your father? Are there co-morbid conditions like hypertension, diabetes, etc present? Aneurysms present with sudden, unbearable headache, double vision, and rigid neck. This is often associated with very high blood pressure. If the CT scan was normal, you may also want to try MRI or MRA to visualize the anatomy in that part. Hang on and do keep us posted. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "They did an MRI today, it was normal. He has no diabetes, hypertension, or other pre-existing conditions. Eats a mostly vegetarian diet and is in very good physical shape. He does not drink, smoke, or do any drugs. He used to drink regularly 15+ years ago, but hasn't touched a drink in 15 years. As of right now, they say that it is likely an infection in the spinal fluid. But they can't say for sure.",

            "answer": "Hi,It is good that the MRI was fine. It would help to identify the possible triggers of this headache. There is a headache tracker here in Medhelp that may be used. Infection can be treated with medications. But you can also suggest complementary and alternative medicine such as biofeedback\u00a0\u00a0with your father. This has improved the headaches of\u00a0\u00a0plenty of patients as seen in the studies done by the National Institute of Health. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "My father has some symptoms that three doctors cant figure out.\u00a0\u00a0He is a healthy fifty six year old indian male. five days ago he presented with severe head pain on the top of his head. On a scale of one to ten, he said ten. he has no other symptoms except for a white count of 15000 and as low grade fever. A full head ct, blood workup, chest x ray, and lumbar puncture rules out everything his doctors can think of. Vicodin does nothing for his pain, his blood pressure is 140/80 o2 sats normal, and he has no symptoms except for the severe pain. He DOES have malaria, but no one believes that is what this is. He has had no physical trauma. Any help or idea would be appreciated.",
