            "answer": "Hello, don't mistake me for a medical person because you'll be dissappointed. But your readings seem to be pretty good but with both your parents having type 2 diabetes it is good for you to keep checking so you can contact an endocrionologist is it does start elevating. An endocrinologist is a doctor that specializes in hormones and since insulin is a hormone they also specialize in diabetes. Everything done with diabetes is best done the sooner the better.i'd also recommend starting to get a little exercise as this is something all diabetics are recommended. Walking is a good exercise and most people have an area where they can do walking for exercise.goog luck in finding it first so you can do things to control it earlier than if you don't, bret",

    "question": "Both parents are diabetic- mother diagnosed at 55 and now insulin dependent and father diagnosed at 56 not insulin dependent. Both are overweight but managing ok. I have some cardiac issues at age 39- an arrythmia which is benign but nonetheless the cardiologist after seeing him tonight mentioned that I need to be mindful of developing diabetis given the risk factors I have.12 hr fasting readings were: 90, 106, 88, 102After meals about 2 hrs - readings were around 120 rangeIs this all in the normal range?I am not overweight but could loose 5-6 pounds .. what are some of the things I can do to mitigate the risk. Is there a website that speaks to prevention and steps to take so as to prevent or delay it.Many thanks-",
