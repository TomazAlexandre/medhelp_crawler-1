            "answer": "You can try spacing it out - but your body eliminates water at it's own speed based on how much your body needs at that particular moment --- keeping yourself hydrated is VERY good.However - if you're worried about your prostrate -- check with your doctor.I DID go to the restroom more often during TX - and I had Insomnia - which isn't as bad these days - but was horrible for about 2 years --- now I'm a sound sleeper ---- but I had to go at all hours - and every time I went - it felt like I was right back in the bathroom again...I guess you could try drinking half the amount --- and waiting - then drinking the other half --- to see if it causes you to go more often.But --- if you think it might be related to a prostrate issue --- then get it checked.And here's hoping *pardon the pun* that everything comes out all right.*GRIN*Meki",

    "question": "Dear AllI have noticed that i am having excessive urination during Tx. First i thought it might be because of increase in water intake but surely thats not due to increase in water intake. Some time I have to go for urination after every 20-30 minutes which is very irritating. I have experimented to reduce water intake but again the excessive urination does exist. Especially it increase at night when i lay down to sleep. I have to go to washrooms atleast 3-4 time within first one hour of my sleep and then nothing at all during all night. Sometime it feels that my body doesnt accept water/liquid and every time i drink a glass of water i have to go to washroom for 2-3 times. I want to know if it happens to all during Tx, or its due to some other reason like prostrate inflamation etc???",
