            "answer": "Thank you so much, I have Consumers Choice USA, but their only a discount program.\u00a0\u00a0And I just recently had to go to the hospital for something that was unrelated to my diabetes, and now I'm on the hook for about $8000.\u00a0\u00a0The nature of the way insurance works in this country is ridiculous. But, I guess thats another topic.thanks so much, I'll check that link out.",

            "answer": "Hi,I have a suggestion about your hospital bill-did you call the billing department and ask to see if you could get a discount or write off?\u00a0\u00a0You will have to fill out paperwork, but depending on your income the hospital will adjust your bill(most do)\u00a0\u00a0We didn't think we would qualify but we did after filling out the papers.Another suggestion-do you have any centers in your area that want volunteers for their diabetic studies?\u00a0\u00a0That might be a way to get your supplies for a year and do some good for research-look on the JDRF website for information.",

    "question": "I had a job prior where I was in a group plan, I got laid off awhile ago and used my full 18 months of Cobra, but then that ran out.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm using Consumers Choice, which isn't really insurance, but a discount program.\u00a0\u00a0So, far there coverage on prescription drugs(non-diabetic) have actually been better than I thought.\u00a0\u00a0But, as most people know, insurance companies & pre-existing conditions don't mix well.\u00a0\u00a0I've enough pump supplies to carry me through thus far, but will need more eventually and the medical coverage is iffy at best.\u00a0\u00a0Right before my Cobra expired I looked into getting some coverage via Hippa, but the only one who would even consider me was Anthem and they wanted like $650/month.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not saying my health isn;t worth the price, but if you don't have, you don't have it.\u00a0\u00a0Thus the cut rate I have now.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have any recommendations or suggestions for coverage thats not outrageous?And I'd also like to pass along a few links, I recently started ordering my insulin from Canada, and it's a deal compared to here in the US.\u00a0\u00a0Novolog is sold under the name NovoRapid in Canada(no difference otherwise). I get 6 vials for about $175 w/ shipping and get it in 2 days.\u00a0\u00a0They have other supplies, like pens & other types also.\u00a0\u00a0You do need a valid prescription!The link is: http://www.canadianpharmacymeds.com/And this for test strips for my BG meter, about 1/2 of any other place I've found.The link is: http://www.americandiabeteswholesale.com/Just thought I'd pass the info along to those in the same boat as me.",
