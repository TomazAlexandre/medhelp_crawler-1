            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, you need a detailed evaluation. First thing need to be ruled out is oropharyngeal candidiasis or thrush. Candidiasis, it can present in many ways (white plaque, erythematous and beefy appearance).Candida is yeast which is responsible for this. But this should be confirmed by KOH preparation and microscopy which will show the candidial growth. This usually occurs in immunocompromised condition like diabetes, steroid therapy or HIV.Nystatin suspension, nystatin troche or clotrimazole troche are the topical preparations against prescription, which is quite effective and safe to treat candida. Other possibility can be abnormal mucosal growth, which can present as ulcerative lesion but we will take it as unlikely cause. I suggest you to consult a physician for systematic evaluation and confirmation of the diagnosis. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I have white specks that come out of my mouth sometimes that are hard and the back of my throat is VERY mucousy and smells extremely bad. My nose has VERY mucous as well. I am constantly siffing/snorting mucous. It is that irritating. It feels like there is something down my throat. I did in fact get tonsils out when I was little so I know it is not tonsil stones or tonsilitis. Just hoping someone can answer my questions and I am hoping I do not have something that is contagious or life threatening. I do not think so but you never know.\u00a0\u00a0My throat is a bit sore as well. Drinking water helps a little bit. I do not know this is an allergic reaction or thrush or what? And if it is thrust how do you get it? Thanks for the advice.",
