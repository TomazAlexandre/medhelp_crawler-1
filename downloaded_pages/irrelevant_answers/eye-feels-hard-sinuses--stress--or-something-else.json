            "answer": "another tonometry test would be the conservative route.\u00a0\u00a0that would certainly rule out raised intraocular pressure.BUT: if it were hard enough that you, an untrained layperson could feel the difference, you'd have other problems as well... like cloudy vision, severe red eye or pain.\u00a0\u00a0you cant have mildly raised IOP and \"feel it\", and you cant have GREATLY raised IOP and *not* feel it.\u00a0\u00a0if it was high enough to make it feel hard to the touch, you'd likely also be in excruciating pain.much more likely that you just kind of noticed that the human eye is rather firm to the touch (it is) and you feel pressure from sinuses at the same time...",

            "answer": "i cannot refrain on weighing in.\u00a0\u00a0apologies in advance for the rant:southern gal: what you posted is a very common misconception among many patients...that optometrists are just for glasses and contacts and ophthalmologists are the ones to go to if there's anything wrong.\u00a0\u00a0that was true...in 1950.every single state has optometry \"diagnostics\" laws which means that not only are the optometrists who are licensed in that state forced to show competency in the diagnosis and management of almost all known eye diseases, they are also LIABLE if they miss a diagnosis of eye disease, or fail to manage it correctly.\u00a0\u00a0so trust me, no optometrist is going to \"miss\" some horrible eye disease.\u00a0\u00a04/5 of optometry school is dedicated to learning about eye disease, i'm not joking.\u00a0\u00a0we get more \"eye\" training in number of hours than most ophthalmologists ever do, b/c they are wasting their time in med school learning about diverticulitis and doing cpr on gunshot victims in the ER. etc.\u00a0\u00a0at one of my internships i knew way, way more about everything that was remotely eye related than the ophthalmologist residents who were there.it doesnt help that the AMA totally propagtes this widely held but incorrect position on the differences between OD's & MD's.but i'll tell you the difference in the year 2006:ophthalmologists are surgeons.\u00a0\u00a0you should go to an ophthalmologist if you think you need surgery.\u00a0\u00a0go to an optometrist for literally everything else.\u00a0\u00a0you do not necessarily need an ophthalmologist if your \"eyes are bad\" or if you've had some old injury or if you have diabetes or thyroid problems or anything else.\u00a0\u00a0in fact in general if you plan on actually SEEING better...most optometrists are much better refractionsts so your Rx ends up being closer anyway.these are all my opinions, of course.",

    "question": "Is something wrong here?Brief History: 25 year old nearsighted white female.- December 05 - Had regular eye appointment; received new prescription.- January 06 - started noticing \"spots\" in vision.- Early Feb 06 - went to regular eye doctor to have \"spots\" checked after reading it could be a precursor to retinal detachment. No flashes or other symptoms noticed. Can see spots though, so it can be difficult to focus on computer screens and print. Eyes were dilated using medication, checked, all looked fine.. no retinal issues.- March 06 - Workstation changed at work. Had a lot of glare issues so they gave me a Flat Screen (not sure I dig it).
