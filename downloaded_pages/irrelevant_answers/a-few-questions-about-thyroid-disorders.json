            "answer": "You have quite a list of questions and they're all quite generic...1)\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid diseases can start at any time and we don't always know it... Typically, symptoms can show up long before blood work shows that we have a thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0While some symptoms \"cross over\" and can apply to both hyper and hypothyroidism, each one has some distinct symptoms, so you'd be able to tell the difference relatively easily.2) Some people get pressure in the thyroid area, if the thyroid is swollen/inflamed.3)\u00a0\u00a0There aren't necessarily \"stages\" for hyper or hypothyroidism, though there can be stages for autoimmune thyroid diseases.4)\u00a0\u00a0It depends on what you mean by \"natural\"... some people consider desiccated thyroid hormones as \"natural\", others consider taking vitamins/minerals as being the natural way to balance the body.5)\u00a0\u00a0There have been some viruses linked to autoimmune thyroid disease.6)\u00a0\u00a0Both the pancreas and thyroid are part of the endocrine system, so all the hormones have to work in sync with each other.\u00a0\u00a0Type I diabetes, Hashimoto's and Graves Disease are all autoimmune diseases.7)\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what you're asking about low potassium levels... it's not, typically, linked to thyroid conditions.8)\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid symptoms depend on the person and/or whether they get treatment in a timely fashion.\u00a0\u00a0It all depends on the individual and their thyroid, how/when it stops working or starts working overtime (in the case of hyperthyroidism).9)\u00a0\u00a0Yes, thyroid levels can fluctuate, as can symptoms.10) Yes, numbness/tingling can be associated with hypothyroidism, as well as other things.11)\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroidism is treated with thyroid replacement hormones, whether they be synthetic hormones, such as Synthroid or some other brand, or a desiccated hormone, such as Armour or other brand.12/13) Thyroid hormone treatment depends on what causes the hypo/hyperthyroidsm and lasts as long as necessary... Treatment for hypothyroidism is most often for life.14) As with the pancreas, the adrenals are part of the endocrine system, so everything must work in sync.\u00a0\u00a0Typically, when the thyroid begins to fail, the adrenals kick in to take up the slack and when one is given thyroid replacement hormones, the adrenals will balance out... it doesn't always work this way - depending on if there's really an adrenal issue.",

            "answer": "Thank you SO much for taking the time and answering all of my questions! It means so much and you've been external helpful!! Thank you a million times!Based on your answers, would a doctor be able to tell if the thyroid disorder was autoimmune?I think what I fear most is having to take pills for life, I only turned 20 and I didn't think id have to worry about such things yet :/ if only there were different alternatives for hypo that doesn't force one to go on pills for life.",

            "answer": "There are specific tests that have to be done to determine whether or not one has an autoimmune thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0Those tests would depend on whether one has hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism... Sometimes, all of the antibody tests are suggested, but if one only has symptoms of hypothyroidism, there's no point in testing for Graves Disease, because it's never associated with hypothyroidism...Unfortunately, hypothyroidism doesn't pick its victims by age groups; we've had people with newborn babies who have hypothyroidism and even they have to take medication for life... If you had a heart condition or diabetes that you had to take medicine for or if your doctor told you to take a daily vitamin pill, you'd do it without even thinking about it . Taking a daily thyroid medication is no different from any of those things... Once realize how much better is makes you feel, you wouldn't dream of \"not\" taking it.\u00a0\u00a0It simply becomes a fact of life, like getting out of bed, brushing your teeth, taking a shower, combing your hair.Most people are started out on a T4 only medication, which is taken first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, then you wait 30-60 minutes before you eat/drink anything else.\u00a0\u00a0I used to use that time to get my shower and dry my hair and by the I was finished, the time was up, my coffee was brewed and I could go about my day.\u00a0\u00a0You simply put it into your schedule and it becomes a habit.",
