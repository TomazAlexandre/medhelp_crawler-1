            "answer": "Best treatments are controlling blood pressure and diabetes if you have them, following a kidney diet, and exercising. Limiting protein, certain vegetables and fruits high in potassium and limiting phosphorus (packed foods are a big no no) can really make a difference. I raised my GFR about 12 points using a kidney diet. That is the only thing I changed. I hate to admit it but I didn't increase my exercises. For some reason me and exercise do not get along. lol. (I call it lazy butt syndrome)",

It went from 53 back to 61 but then down to 50 which was lower than when I even started the diet. again. am wondering if the 61 was even right now!!!\u00a0\u00a0as every other test I have had showed a rapid and continual drop. I dont really understand the ultrasound results but it said at the bottom of the report that findings were consistent with advanced chroinc renal impairment.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has heard of results like this I would really like some help.\u00a0\u00a0i do see neph for first time in a few days but am feeling pretty depressed about the short lived rise in my egfr, was very disappointed as I kind of expected a further rise, not a drop lower than it even was before the idet",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. Once in kidney failure, there is likely to be progression of the disease. Chronic kidney disorders will usually cause a shrinkage in the kidney size. This a structural abnormality. The functional assessment is the GFR and this is also likely to reduce over time. The diet, the medications and lifestyle measure will only prolong the course of this eventuality. So, you continue with the instructions and medications and follow up at regular intervals to monitor the progress.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.As I gather you an aching pain just below the ribs more likely to be in the area where the kidneys are located, which is at the back below the ribs and next to the spine. This is accompanied by a foamy urine which could be due to proteinuria. Diabetes can affect the kidneys and cause nephropathy. The earliest indication of this is microalbimnuria. The hyperglycemia produces\u00a0\u00a0increased matrix production and\u00a0\u00a0thickening of the of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM). This causes the nephropathy. Please consult your primary care physician for further evaluation.Now when you meet your doctor the following tests may need to be done. Assess the kidney function, this is done by a blood urea and creatinine and sometimes a GFR (glomerular filteration rate). Assess the kidney structure, with an ultrasonogram, an IVP (intravenous pyelogram), here a dye is injected to study the kidneys. Sometimes a CT or MRI may throw more results.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
