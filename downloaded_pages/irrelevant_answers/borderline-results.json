            "answer": "HI Thesunset_hm! and welcome to the forum.Thyroid testing for cellular thyroid function is complex and should not be.I definitely favor the o/f method of taking and the basal temperature(do a search online for \"Dr Barnes Basal Temperature Test\").You definitely need the rT3 (reverse T3) as well, as the fT3/rT3 ratio is probably the most reliable marker for low cellular thyroid function.Look for a ratio of over 20 for healthy thyroid function. (divide Free T3 by reverse T3, but make sure you are in the same unit measurement for both.)Hypothyroid is passed to the baby down in the womb by the undertreated/untreated hypothyroid expecting mother (often un-diagnosed or worse misdiagnosed).Note that this is not in the genes, however it could be an additional causal factor.Excellent advice from Red Star. Hypothyroid 2 is just like Diabetes 2,where there's resistance to insulin produced by the pancreas & present in the serum, but not making it into the tissues, where it is needed.In Hypothyroid 2, the thyroid gland is producing thyroid hormones, yetwhile\u00a0\u00a0normal levels are circulating in the serum, they are not getting into the tissues (cells).Another possibility is low adrenal function (hypoadrenalism),which would have hypothyroid as secondary.Please let me know if you need more details, but one word of caution:Conventional Endocrinologists may not be open to what we are posting here, so do not be surprised if s/he dismisses all this!With what I know and if it were me, I would go to a Holistic Endocrinologist , Functional medicine Doctor or ND, knowledgeable in this field.Best wishesNIko",

    "question": "The past year or so I've been dealing with anxiety, depression, GI problems, brain fog, constant fatigue, heart palpitations, and significant weight gain with no lifestyle changes. Nearly every female on my moms side of the famil has thyroid disorders. My levels recently were TSH - .8 (.3-5.60) FT4 - .91 (.61-1.12) FT3 - 3.47 (2.50-3.90).\u00a0\u00a0Normal for my lab is in parenthesis. I've been taking anti depressants for anxiety and depression while seem to help but I have been told my thyroid levels are fine because they are in normal range. I'm not sure if I agree 100% because what's normal for some may not be for others. I need a second opinion! I'm trying to see an endocrinologist but my levels are normal so no one in my area will take me. Any comments will help, thanks",
