            "answer": "You should get checked by a doctor for asthma and allergies. Meanwhile you can buy an over-the-counter antihistamine, like Benadryl. If it eliminates your shortness of breath then you know you are allergic to something. There are other antihistamines besides Benadryl, but Benadryl will help you get a good night's sleep if you take it at bedtime. That would eliminate you lack of sleep problem.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.By PT do you mean pulmonary tuberculosis? If so then you need antituberculous therapy. Inadequate oxygenation can produce symptoms of breathlessness, as the body tries in an effort to compensate for the decreased oxygen supply. The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. And have lung function test done, looks like your symptoms are due to Asthma.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am 20 year old, female, U.S. Marine. I work out on a day to day basis, sometimes more than once a day. For the past five days I have been very short on breath, dizzy, exhausted, and my heart is beating faster and harder than normal. I went to the health clinic on my base and they said it was shortness of breath due to PT. However, even though I first noticed it during PT, it is a very continuous thing. I can be sitting on the couch, or even just cooking or cleaning my house and I will feel like I just ran a marathon. Even just walking up my steps is a challenge. I am constantly sighing and yawning just to feel some kind of relief, but it only lasts for a few seconds before I have to do it again. The only time I am okay is when i am sleeping, but the fear of not being able to breathe while sleeping is keeping me from getting a good amount of sleep. The other morning I woke up completely out of breath and feeling like it'd been a while since I had taken a breath at all. I need help, and I need an answer. Since I am in such a high demanding physical fitness job I cannot afford to have this affect my life. I need to be able to run, carry people, lift ammo cans, etc. And right now I can barely lift my head. Please help me find an answer.",
