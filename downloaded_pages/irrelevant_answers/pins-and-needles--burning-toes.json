            "answer": "I was just diagnosed with Small Fiber Neuropathy. Have some of the same symptoms but not so much the burning. My neuro ran a load of blood tests, and ordered an EMG, QSART (sweat test), Tilt Table and skin biopsies of my leg (best test for SFN).The best they can tell me is it may be caused by an autoimmune disorder - but no indication of which one.I do know that once they figure out the cause, if they can treat the cause and it was caught early enough, the small fibers can regenerate.Good luck to you!",

    "question": "Young healthy 42 year old woman. Started having pain in one toe then in a number of toes on right foot. Then progressed to pins and needles and now I am experiencing burning sensations at different times, in toes and\u00a0\u00a0over different parts of my body. There are no physical signs of any problem noticable on my body.\u00a0\u00a0I had a CT scan of brain which is clear and I have been cleared for diabetes.Could you possibly give me an indication of what it might be. I am seeing a neurologist next week but the waiting is killing me. I am very anxious and also wonder if this might be contributing to my symptoms. I have researched a lot and nothing seems to fit.Please help.",
