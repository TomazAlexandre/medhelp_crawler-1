            "answer": "I have struggled with this in the past and can't for the life of me figure out how a dog can be outside and then come inside and pee - but for one of my dogs, he is just so happy to be playing and running around, he forgets and then when he gets inside and is quiet and calm - then he pees. Usually I don't make a fuss of it, I just wipe it up (I have tile floors and no carpet) and put him outside and say \"Outside, Outside\" and then I try and watch him a lot so I can catch before it happens - usually I can tell. Then offer treats when they pee outside and say \"Good doggie - outside.\"That's the best advice I have. Sometimes dogs pee as making a statement - they want out and don't want in so they pee to get to go back out again - Mommy puts me out when I pee - so I will pee. But I try not to make a hub bub over it - negative reinforcement.Sorry, but I have learned to cope with it and just pay more attention to the dog and maybe that is what they want anyway if there are no medical needs. Plus not feeding dry food helps and with dry dog food they drink more water - so I would feed wet.Mercy",

            "answer": "Wow - it's very unusual for a healthy 2 year old beagle to be peeing in the house that often - whether she's housetrained or not. Does she drink lots and lots of water? Does she pant a lot, even if she hasn't been active?My 11 year old beagle was completely housetrained, and over a period of a couple of weeks, she wasn't - and she was going out maybe 10 times a day and still having accidents in the house. She was also having all the symptoms I asked about above. Turns out she has diabetes insipidus, which means peeing all the time, colorless urine, and constant thirst. The disease is pretty unusual, but when it does occur, it's usually in dogs 2 to 9 years old. It's very treatable (although expensive). My dog's been on treatment and is back to her old self.Just out of curiosity, do you crate your beagle girl when you're away? That might be helpful, if her problem turns out to be behavioral.",
