            "answer": "There's not really a whole lot to go, here... except the symptoms, which can apply to both, diabetes and hyperthyroidism, as well as hypothyroidism or a number of other conditions.The diarrhea could have been a hyperthyroid thing, with the bleeding secondary from the prolonged diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0I can't imagine that your doctor didn't pull a thyroid panel (TSH, Free T3, Free T4, as well as antibodies TPOab, TgAb and TSI), as well a diabetic panel (fasting blood glucose, hemoglobin A1c, urinalysis, including ketones and protein levels) right off the bat.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, you had all that pepsi on the way there, so there was no way to get a fasting blood glucose... next time - nothing but water on the way to the doctor or the lab.Monocytes are a type of white blood cell and elevated levels indicates inflammation/infection somewhere..RDW indicates the size of your red blood cells and is often elevated with low vitamin B-12 levels.\u00a0\u00a0Get that checked.I can't imagine putting nothing in my stomach besides Pepsi... There's something about 3 pepsi's not spiking blood sugar that doesn't sound right, but we'll leave that for the time being.Did you get the thyroid panel?\u00a0\u00a0If so, please post those results, with reference ranges, which vary lab to lab and have to come from your own report.\u00a0\u00a0That's the only way we can know if your symptoms are caused by thyroid, since there are other causes for those symptoms.Hypoglycemia is low blood sugar, which is the opposite of diabetes, but like diabetes, one should avoid sugar and other things that spike blood glucose levels, which in turn spikes insulin levels and causes one to have low blood sugar, again.\u00a0\u00a0It becomes a never ending roller coaster.Until I see the thyroid tests, I'm going to think that maybe you have more than one problem and maybe they're all tied in with your eating habits.",

            "answer": "I like that myxedema pinch test. I've yet to find this test positive in anyone other than my mother (who has Hashimoto's thyroiditis) and myself and I've pinched a lot of people lol.I had internal tremors from a few conditions and they all have their own frequency so I know what it's from. Magnesium deficiency, hypothyroidism, metabolic acidosis. I've had excessive thirst since forever and only realised since I'm not drinking anywhere near as much it was due to insulin resistance as well as magnesium deficiency.Hypoglycemia can be due to insulin resistance (precusor to diabetes) but in my case no labs showed this until I had my actual insulin levels measured. In my case, high insulin really suppressed my appetite. And when I had hyperthyroidism, this worsened my insulin resistance and I also developed impaired glucose intolerance (pre diabetes) due to too much thyroid hormone messing with the pancreas (or something lol).",

So I should have my results no later then Tuesday (fingers crossed). I promise to post them as soon as I get them.

I know about an endo. thyroid but do they do things like check for things you mentioned or was there another specialist or just your PCP? Hope you're doing better since finding out what was wrong.

    "question": "I'm 39 years old, female, 118lbs and 5' 9\". Let me tell you a little bit about what's been going on with me and hopefully I can get some of you to give me your honest opinion. Sorry this is so long but I'm trying to be as through as possible, thanks for reading\u00a0\u00a0:)For the last couple of years I've been having these bouts which consist of fatigue, whole body tremors, weakness, excessive thirst, sweating (for no reason) also night sweats, waking in the middle of the night, rapid heart rate, loose stools and my menstrual cycle stopped a year ago. These symptoms come and go and vary from moderate to not being able to get out of bed. My family (hubby and kids) and some of my friends seem to think this is all caused by my poor eating habits ( sometimes one meal a day) and I will agree that this is not a good way to eat. I do notice that when these symptoms come on and I eat something sweet (ie Nature Valley Peanut Butter Chewy Granola Bar and a glass of Pepsi) within an hour my symptoms start to go away but I never really feel quite right.Then the hammer fell at the beginning of this month, 6/1/14 to be exact. I woke up to the worst GI pain I think I've ever had, I almost didn't make it to the bathroom\u00a0\u00a0:blink:. For two days I was in and out of the bathroom every 5-15 min. with worst smelling GI's I've ever had. Day three and I noticed the blood on the tissue, by afternoon it was visibly in the toilet as well\u00a0\u00a0:o and my bouts (described above) were getting worse and more frequent. I started getting headaches all the time, some lasting all day. And then this past Sunday I woke in the middle of the night and couldn't open my eyes. It felt like someone taped sandpaper under my eye lids and I had a large amount of yellow goop in my left eye. Since then my eyes have been very dry and every time I wake up they're so dry it's hard to open them and focus. Needless to say i was scared at this point so I called my insurance and spoke with an on call nurse, she recommended I see my doc. ASAP. I made an appointment but in the meantime I started speaking with family members about any health issues within the family. Here's what I found out (some I already knew about)...My two sisters (my only siblings) both diagnosed with Graves Disease, one has low blood sugar but not DiabetesSisters daughter (20yrs) just had routine blood drawn and showed elevated TSH, will know more with further testing.Mothers side:Aunt J has Type 2 Diabetes, Cholesterol, 4 heart stintsMother has Type 2 Diabetes and HypoCousin K had Thyroid CancerCousin M has Breast CancerUncles J & T had Prostate CancerGrandpa died of Prostate CancerFathers side:Father died of heart failure, he also had Diabetes (type unknown)Aunt M Diabetes (type unknown)Aunt M died of heart failureWhen I saw my doc. (she's a new one btw) she took blood and a urine test. She said my symptoms were probably because of my eating habits and that I had pink eye (she gave me a script, I refuse to take it, no one blames me for it either). Now I don't know about anyone else but I've seen a lot of pink eye in my day with having kids and all but there is NO WAY on this earth that I have pink eye and no one else I know believes her either. So she orders me to go get an Abdominal CT Scan done stat and to make an appt. with a GI doc.Finally got in to see GI doc. on Thursday 6/19 and he orders me to have a Colonoscopy on Monday 6/23...he said I could eat all day Saturday till 12:00am but nothing after that, till after my test. Sunday I couldn't make it, almost passed out and my hubby agreed that i needed to eat and that I would just have to reschedule. When GI office called me Monday I declined to reschedule until I went back my doc. to have her run more test before I do anything else. Made appt. to see her for Wed. 6/25.I grab my CT Scan results from the radiology lab to see what they found. Several parts of my colon had inflammation and/or thickening and I had an elongated right lobe of the liver.Mean while my sisters both firmly believe that I have Graves Disease at this point and suggest I ask my doc. to give me a Full Thyroid Panel. And are further angered by the fact that she didn't do a test before knowing my family history.6/25 appt: I explain what happened to me over the weekend but she insist that I reschedule my colonoscopy stat, I said not until you run more test because something is seriously wrong with me. I repeated my family history and requested a Full Thyroid Panel, she agreed. I also asked to be tested for Diabetes, she said she ruled that out already (I was relieved) but not for long (more to come). So she hands me a script for the lab which I had to fast overnight for, so I went the next morning.The more to come...So I signed up that day for my doc., the local hospital and the labs \"Patient Portal\" so I could start being more proactive in my health care. When I get back from the lab the next day I got an email saying my results are in. ???? I just got back, so I signed in and low and behold it's my labs from the first visit with her on 6/5, so I start going through it and noticed some issues. I will note anything NOT within range...Test was taken after I had consumed 2 glasses of Pepsi at home and one bottle of Pepsi on the way to and in the office, so all drank within 1 1/2 hour before this test. Nothing to eat that morning yet.Monocytes 16%\u00a0\u00a0range 4-12%RDW 15.7%\u00a0\u00a0range 12.3-15.4%WBC 3.3\u00a0\u00a0range 3.4-10.8Glucose Serum 56mg\u00a0\u00a0range 65-99mgBun/Creatinine Ratio 7\u00a0\u00a0range 8-20Chloride, Serum 93mmol\u00a0\u00a0range 97-108mmolI have since switched doctors because I really feel like this women should have called me with these result and had me come in sooner for more testing, esp. with my family history. I can't help but wonder what my Glucose level would have been had I not drank those sodas... Guess I'll have to wait till I see my new doc. on the July 15th or I can see them through the lab patient portal.Well thanks for listening to me and being patient enough to get to the end, I really appreciate it. Any advice would be so very welcome and also much appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0:)QuoteMultiQuoteEdit",
