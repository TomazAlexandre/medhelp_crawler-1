            "answer": "I try not to be cynical about staying healthy, but I've seen alot of people develop illnesses who lived perfectly healthy lifestyles.\u00a0\u00a0The only way I can look at that is to say, \"if that person had led an unhealthy lifestyle, he/she may have gotten sicker sooner, with a worse prognosis, etc.\"\u00a0\u00a0Keeps me from getting down I guess.Yeh, I've exercised religiously for almost 10 years now, and I eat a healthier diet than most people I know, so hopefully i'm delaying a possibly diabetic onset.\u00a0\u00a0I did read about something called LADA (type 1.5 diabetes), and that would make alot more sense for someone like me who has no risk factors.....Thanks for the response.\u00a0\u00a0Are you T1 or T2?\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to us!",
