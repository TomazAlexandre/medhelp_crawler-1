            "answer": "Hello,I am sorry about my delayed reply, I have been on vacation.A nodular thyroid can be quite common and not necessarily worrisome, but if your nodules are increasing in size and you are experiencing some compression symptoms(like the trouble swallowing) you should speak with your doctor about having these attended to as soon as possible. Options would include repeat biopsy as well as surgical removal, after discussion with your doctor.You will also need to have our insulin regimen adjusted if your glucose levels are still high.I am sorry I cannot offer more specific advice but your situation truly requires an extensive visit wth your physician in order to sort these issues out and get them treated appropriately. Please schedule an appointment as soon as you can.Take care.",
