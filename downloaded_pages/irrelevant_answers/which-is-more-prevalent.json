            "answer": "Natural SupportSupport the thyroid with optimal nutrition by eating foods rich in iodine such as kelp, dulse, spinach, kale and turnip greens. Foods packed with omega-3 fatty acids, magnesium, selenium and zinc are also an excellent support system for the thyroid.Avoid gluten products such as wheat, barley, rye and replace with sprouted (no-flour) grain breads such as Ezekiel bread, Essene and Manna. Limit dairy other than organic eggs and avoid products containing MSG, soy, peanuts, unsaturated and polyunsaturated oils and fats (replace with olive oil, coconut oil and flax seed oil), white sugar, bok choy and mustard greens.Heavy metals can interfere with the liver's ability to metabolize thyroid hormones and testing should be done if suspected. There are a number of heavy metal cleanses available on the market in addition to detox foot pads that target the elimination of heavy metals in the body.",

I\u2019m not up much on thyroid stuff though; maybe I should have remained quiet on this topic :o).And by the way, I was bitten once by a ladybug, and it hurt like hell. Surprised the dickens out of me\u2026 never as a kid, but only five years ago, I had one bite my hand as I was carrying it out of the house :o).LOL, cut that out :o)!Bill",

Her house was on fire and the children were all alone. (Please tell me you know that nursery rhyme and don't think I'm crazy)Well, the only reason I asked about what causes it, is that I was trying to find out how common it is with women who've treated, now that i have problems myself. When I started researching it (read: Google as research) I found out that hypothyroidism and thyroid autoimmunity is associated with chronic hep c.My doctor has been convinced I'm headed towards Diabetes, I think it's because of tx. I fooled him though, my labs last week were all within normal (fasting blood sugar of 95) my liver functions were 18 and 27 but my thyroid is still not working well even though I've been on medication since December 08.",

Are they the same?I didn't get much training on the injections Marcia because I was late for my appt. The nurse tried to blow mne off, but I said I had already started the riba that morning and would give myself the shot with or without her help. So I got minimal help and an attitude.I think your answer was good Trish. I\u00a0\u00a0was so afraid that I would develop diabetes because of my PCP's dire predictions and I beleive that's related to interferon also, right?Jd what do you take for the Hashimotos? I was on .50 mcg of a generic synthroid, but I was switched to .75 mcg and advised not to take the generic as it doesn't work as well. The PA said that there are 2 drugs she advises against generic use and the synthroid is one of them. And Interferon is the other.....(just kidding)",

So what do you mean, you're going to have to treat it twice???Did your doctor say why your thyroid problems advanced to cancer? Do you have a history of it in your family? Did you know that people with chronic hep c are at a higher risk for thyroid problems. Did your doctor know this?:\"Researchers report that people with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are at a significantly higher risk of having thyroid disorders. The study authors recommend that HCV patients should be periodically screened for thyroid function, in particular hypothyroidism, which affected 13 percent of the HCV patients in this study. HCV-infected patients also had higher rates of being positive for anti-thyroid autoantibodies, an early indicator of autoimmune thyroid disease.\" (SOURCE: American Journal of Medicine, July 1, 2004.)I'm talking to you the way I talk to my husband when he comes home from the dr. Usually husband's answers consist of \"I don't know\"; \"I didn't ask him\"; or the classic: \"He didn't say anything about that\" (which translates into \"And I didn't ask him about that either)It just makes me want me to want to rip off my wings!Are you seeing an endocrinologist?
