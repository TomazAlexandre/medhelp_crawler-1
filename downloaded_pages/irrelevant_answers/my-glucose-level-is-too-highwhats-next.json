            "answer": "You probably have or are at risk for gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This is fairly common and usually managed pretty successfully provided you follow your doctors instructions. I know plenty of women that had it with their pregnancies, and none of them had any complications cuz they did what the doctor said. I even think Selma Hyek had gestational diabetes with her recent pregnancy.I do know your baby (or babies) tend to be bigger if you have this.\u00a0\u00a0I also think it's possible to gain a lot of weight during your pregnancy when you have it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure why.\u00a0\u00a0I have to do my glucose test too this week. I'm avoiding it because I HATE that stuff you drink. Ick. :(Don't worry, everything will be fine!\u00a0\u00a0Just see the dietician and eat what your doctor recommends.Sheri",

            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes for the 2nd time this pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I also had it w/ my son 2 yrs ago.\u00a0\u00a0I went to see an endocrinologist and my numbers were good enough to be diet controlled.\u00a0\u00a0I am doing fine and the baby is doing fine by diet alone.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 38 weeks and the worst is not being able to eat what I want to eat!!\u00a0\u00a0I eat sugar free pops for a snack.\u00a0\u00a0You will learn what you can and can't eat.\u00a0\u00a0My best advice if you are diet controlled is to eat a protein, a carb and some fruit in one meal.\u00a0\u00a0I can't eat even a half of an apple by itself b/c it makes my blood sugar too high but if i eat a 1/2 sandwhich on whole grain bread w/ a cup of yogurt (has to be the diet stuff like light and fit) then I can eat a piece of fruit.\u00a0\u00a0At night I have popcorn for a munchy.\u00a0\u00a0Towards the end of my pregnancy I started taking evening primrose oil( ask your dr) to thin my cervix and it has dropped my numbers by 20mg so I can eat a bit more!!!\u00a0\u00a0I have even had a small piece of chocolate cake w/ some slices of cheese (protein) and my numbers were ok.\u00a0\u00a0The combination and amounts are important.\u00a0\u00a0Don't eat white bread, use whole wheat or whole grain.\u00a0\u00a0Skip anything w/ obvious sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Your dr will tell you all you need to know but ask if you have questions.\u00a0\u00a0Not that it means much to you now but my numbers are always between 60 and 120.\u00a0\u00a0this is good.\u00a0\u00a0:)\u00a0\u00a0best wishes",

            "answer": "Hi,failing that test means you have or are at risk for gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You will be put on a strict diet, which will mean eating 5 - 6 small meals a day and closely controlling how much carbs you eat.\u00a0\u00a0You will also need to exercise regularly (daily if you possibly can) - all to help control your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Usually your doctor will ask you to monitor your blood sugar 4 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0First thing in the morning and then 2 hours after every meal.\u00a0\u00a0You will have target blood sugar that you should be less than for each measurement. (for me it is <95 before breakfast and <120 2 hours after eating).For most people this is enough to control blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0If not, then you will need to take insulin.\u00a0\u00a0This is done by injection several times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds scary, but really this may be necessary for your and the baby's health.I am now 14 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Gestational diabetes at about 6 weeks (so for me it was probably pre-existing but before my pregnancy I was able to control blood sugar pretty well with just diet and exercise). I have been monitoring diet and blood sugar but my levels are still above the target for 1 or two readings every day lately.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been able to exercise for the past few weeks because I am still recovering from Ex-Lap and appendectomy three weeks ago. I should be able to start exercising again in another week.However, as my levels have been consistently above target, when I see my endocrinologist doctor next week he will be putting me on insulin for the rest of my pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Not to keen on that, but know it has to be done.\u00a0\u00a0This makes me 'high risk' pregnancy - but i was already anyway because I have hypothyroid and pituitary ademona, and am nearly 38 for this baby, which is my first.\u00a0\u00a0I am still hoping for and will do everythign I can to have a natural delivery. (Am even more convinced after my recent surgery - the exLap is like the first half of a cesarean - and I can tell you the recovery is no joke!).Go ahead and ask any questions.\u00a0\u00a0I am not an expert, but have been reading a lot.\u00a0\u00a0We can go through this together.Sally",

            "answer": "Hi,I got to start insulin today.The idea of having to inject myself was actually much worse than actually doing it.\u00a0\u00a0I have started on a low dose and just inject once a day using a pen gadget that my doctor provided (I have to buy the insulin and the needles).\u00a0\u00a0The needle is very small short and thin and I could hardly feel it, though it did sting a little after the injection.I am on a combination of fast acting and long acting insulin.\u00a0\u00a0This is why I only inject once a day.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor will see me in two weeks and we will adjust if necessary and I am to call him if anything out of the ordinary happens or any questions.I have to say it was such a relief to see my blood sugars today after eating were all well within (rather than above) target.\u00a0\u00a0So I think that using insulin if you need is actually a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0Of course I'll still have to be really careful with diet, but now I have a good chance of being successful.The only bad thing is that I noticed I was really hungry this morning.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps when the short acting was at full force.... so I'm going to have to try really hard not to eat too much when that feeling hits...Just reassuring you that whatever happens it is not really too bad.Sally",
