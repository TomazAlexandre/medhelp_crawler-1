            "answer": "I took metformin a while ago. I'd take it in the morning and by afternoon I'd be sick and vomiting and having bad cramps. After a week of it happening every day, I stopped taking it. Went back to my doctor and he made me take it again but a smaller dose. Same thing. Went back again and got an even smaller dose. Again same thing. I have strictly told the doctor I refuse to take it now. Haven't taken it since. I took it for a week each time because my doctor said it could take a few days for my body to get used to it. Everyone is different though. Some people don't get any side effects. My sister and friend were fine taking it. I'd say give it a go and if you get any symptoms, talk to your doctor.",

I desperately need help because medically I am a mess and I am the heaviest that I have ever been.Any positive success stories out there?",
