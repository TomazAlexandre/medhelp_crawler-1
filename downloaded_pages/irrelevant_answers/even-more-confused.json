            "answer": "Hi!I went through your other posts on the forum. Scattered foci of increased T2/Flair signal indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines. Please discuss with your treating doctors.If you do not have faith in the present doctor, jot down your symptoms and consult another neuro specialist and an internal medicine specialist with your spinal tap and MRI report.Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you Doctor for your reply and for explaining in a way that I can understand. Do you think I may have MS lesions aswell as ischemic? The neuro showed me the pics of MRI, nearer the outside are about five oval shaped rather large white areas and scattered around are lots of smaller white round areas. He still says highly unlikely because of no O-bands in spinal fluid. Yet I know someone who was diagnosed with no scans or Lps, purely on physical symptoms during neuro examination. Thank you",

            "answer": "Hi !MRI alone is not diagnostic of MS and nor is spinal tap. So even if there are no oligonal bands present, if your evoked potential and carotid scans come clear, there is a huge possibility that you have MS.\u00a0\u00a0Ischemic changes can be there due to small vessel disease where the smaller blood vessels of brain are affected or due to diabetes. It is also possible that you have vitamin B12 deficiency. The changes can also be age related. All these test results will need to be combined for a definitive diagnosis. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you doctor you have done more to explain things to me than the doctors who have actually seen me. The neuro said that at 59, it would be extremely unusual to be diagnosed with MS! He didn't seem to be listening when I told him that I had thought back over the years to several occasions when I have had periods of various neurological, balance and other MS symptoms, starting when I was 17 or 18. and mostly after becoming overheated. It is only with hindesight that these periods could now be seen as MS related. Anyway, thank you very much for your time.",

    "question": "Hello again, yesterday I saw the falls clinic doctor that I was referred to b4 the neuro, this was a follow up after the LP. First, he said I havn't got MS because there were no Obands in the spinal fluid, this is regardless of the ovoid lesions in brain! Then when I told him about how I had been affected by the heat he told me I had a stroke. I was in shock I think. How can he say that without doing any kind of physical examination or tests. I have lost confidence in this doctor, especially bearing in mind that he admitted he didn't know what to do with me and wants me to take Beta Blockers, even though my blood pressure is always low and drops when standing.\u00a0\u00a0I will talk to the neuro about all of this when I see him on 12th June.\u00a0\u00a0Carol",
