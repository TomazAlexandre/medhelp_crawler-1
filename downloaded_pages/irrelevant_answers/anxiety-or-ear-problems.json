            "answer": "Hello, Thank you for posting these questions and concerns. Noises in the ear is known as Tinnitus and is very common.Some common causes of tinnitus are:hearing lossnoise exposuremedicationsgeneral health-diabetes, heart diseasestress/anxietycaffeineexcessive use of aspirin/tonic water-anything with quininehead injuryexcessive waxtumors affecting the hearing nerveUnfortunately there is no medical treatment to cure tinnitus.\u00a0\u00a0What we have to do is determine the cause by ruling out the above causes for your particular case.\u00a0\u00a0You will also see several over-the-counter \"treatments\" for tinnitus such as \"ring stop\" however these drops/pills do not treat tinnitus and I would not recommend spending your money on them.As Audiologist, anytime we see unilateral tinnitus, we refer for medical management to determine the cause.\u00a0\u00a0This is typically done through an Ear, Nose and Throat Specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Your primary physician can direct you how to find a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had a full diagnostic hearing evaluation? You can find a provider for a hearing evaluation by visiting www.hearusa.com.Once you are cleared for medical conditions that might be causing your tinnitus you can look at coping strategies and/or a tinnitus masker.\u00a0\u00a0These can be provider through your hearing care provider.There is also something known as Auditory Hallucinations which is a more advanced form of tinnitus and is less common. These patients will report they often hear music or people talking.\u00a0\u00a0This is often caused by medications, interactions with medications or changes in dosage of medications.I hope this information is helpful.Rachele M. Orsini, Au.D.",
