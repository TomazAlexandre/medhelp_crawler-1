            "answer": "First of all never hesitate to call 911. They are employed for this purpose. That is what you should have done.Secondarily, know how to use a glucose meter and have one handy.I would recommend you get her in touch with a good local nurse-practicioner who specialized in diabetes and get her enrolled in a monitoring program. In some jurisdictions fast-acting insulin will not be prescribed unless you are in such a program. They will issue a meter with a memory that must be downloaded as regular meetings with the nurse-practicioner.I am a believes in nurses for these programs. There are doctors and endochronologists who have diabetic control programs, but they don't have the time or interest.",

            "answer": "The situation that your girlfriend was in was an emergency.\u00a0\u00a0In the event she gets like that again, you now know what to do - call the emergency services straight away.There is lots of information on diabetes on the web, so you do not need to buy any books if you are short for cash.Your doctors practise may also have information leaflets available at the surgery about diabetes.Learn about the disease and try and \"drum\" into your girlfriend that she must get serious about taking care of herself and controlling her sugar levels.Having diabetes is a very serious thing.\u00a0\u00a0Uncontrolled high sugar levels can cause peripheral nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0She may already experience loss of sensations on her skin and pins and needles in her feet.\u00a0\u00a0It can cause damage to the back of the eye leading to diabetic retinopathy that can result in blindness.\u00a0\u00a0It can disrupt circulation to limbs which could lead to amputations.\u00a0\u00a0I did know of a 2 young ladies that had their legs amputated, lost their eye sight and eventually died because of uncontrolled diabetes.Damage can also happen way before diabetes shows up in any blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0I know, it happened to me!She MUST have regular checks with a specialist diabetic nurse or doctor (at my surgery, we have a doctor who runs a diabetic clinic).\u00a0\u00a0See if there is one at her surgery that she can get checked regularly.\u00a0\u00a0If she is not controlling her sugar levels by the insulin injection that she takes, her medication needs to modified to suit her specific needs and she may be prescribed to take diabetic tablets as well as the insulin.Keeping a written record of sugar levels by using a glucose meter will be able to show how well she is controlling her diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If she is not sure what foods to eat, there is lots of information on the web and she can also be referred to a specialist nurse that will teach her about nutrition.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise is also important.It is also very important for your girlfriend to have regular eye check ups (at least once a year).\u00a0\u00a0These are not the normal vision check ups.\u00a0\u00a0Her doctor may refer her to the ophthalmologist for diabetic eye screening.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, if this is something that she has to arrange to do herself, she should ask the ophthalmologist practise if they do this.\u00a0\u00a0No all of them do.\u00a0\u00a0The test is painless, eye drops are put into the eyes to open up the iris and a photograph is taken of inside the eyeball.\u00a0\u00a0The ophthalmologist looks to see if there is any damage or signs of damage in the fine blood vessels in the eye ball.\u00a0\u00a0If any vessels are found to be bleeding this could lead to blindness if it affects the retina.\u00a0\u00a0Laser treatment is usually offered to stop the blood vessels from bleeding.If all this information scares her - then that is good.\u00a0\u00a0 Because then she will hopefully, get to understand that having this disease is nothing something that can be messed about with.\u00a0\u00a0Even with medication for her diabetes, she still also must take control to look after her well being and health.Hope all goes well.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "It's good that your care about your g/f.\u00a0\u00a0And yes, you should learn as much as you can about the condition.You can lead by example.When eating out, try to eat healthy foods with complex carbohydrates: vegetables are wonderful for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0 Avoid bad carbohydrates like breads, rice, and potatoes.\u00a0\u00a0 Try to get your g/f to eat healthy with you.\u00a0\u00a0 You'll both be better for it.If you can start walking.\u00a0\u00a0Walking is great exercise.\u00a0\u00a0You can fit it into your routine.\u00a0\u00a0Start by parking your car far away.\u00a0\u00a0 It actually save times, reduces stress from having to look for a spot, and lets you do some walking.\u00a0\u00a0Do it with her.After that you can help her with her checkups.\u00a0\u00a0She may not want them, but knowing what things like an A1C or fasting blood sugar etc are will help and you can talk to her about her numbers.As you get comfortable with the lifestyle, she will too and you can continue to build on that.Be well.",

            "answer": "Sounds like your girlfriend should adopt a low carb diet, in order to reduce incidences of blood sugar cycling up and down.\u00a0\u00a0The more stable the blood sugar level, the less cycling up and down, which is causing her to feel sick.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to manage insulin and medications to counteract ingesting large amounts of carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0So, if she stops eating high amounts of carbs, less need to counteract with meds.\u00a0\u00a0Try a day in two low carb, and you will see the difference.",
