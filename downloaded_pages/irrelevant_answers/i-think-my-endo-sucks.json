Listen to this one...my endo works at \"The Diabetes and Thyroid Institute of Fort Worth\" and when I called today to tell them that I think my blood sugar is messed up he tells me to call my primary care physician because it has nothing to do with my thyroid. Hello???? Diabetes and Thyroid Institute?????\u00a0\u00a0Am I missing something????",

            "answer": "Oh my Liz.....you have a dinkis doctor as well...LOLAnd no my doc hasnt told me why my thyroid swells and makes me cough and burn. He has never even run the hashi tests or anything. In fact he forgot to do my followup ultra sound on my new nodule from 8 mos ago. I have had 2 other nodules that dissolved after biopsy. Yes, the three of us have carnie doctors (carnival doctors) heheHeh Liz...I have been having bouts with hypoglycemia as well. Mine has been dipping down into the 50s. Did you get a glucose meter and start keeping track? I plan on bringing this up to my NEW doctor who despises carnie docs...haha",

            "answer": "No, I haven't gotten a glucose meter. At my last bloodcheck a few weeks ago I was showing very low blood sugar 2 hours after eating but he didn't seem too concerned.\u00a0\u00a0But I've noticed in the past few weeks I'm starting to feel shaky, lightheaded and a whole bunch of other things until I eat. Then it goes away for a bit and comes right back.\u00a0\u00a0I called the endo today to see if I could get a fasting blood glucose test and that's when he told me to call my PCP.\u00a0\u00a0SO, I'm going in tomorrow morning for a blood test and have an appt, in the afternoon. With my regular doctor because, you know...the DIABETES AND THYROID CENTER can't handle it!",

            "answer": "My glucose fasting test didn't show me at my lows. In fact some days it is fine and other days it dips into the 50's, that is why I got the meter to keep track on my own and to know the signs when my sugar level is low. I eat something every 2 1/2 hrs to 3 hrs now and make sure I consume plenty of protein. It has been much more stable since. Oh, I also started adding a glucerna drink late morning and that has made a big diff.\u00a0\u00a0If I were you I would get one so your doc doesn't call you crazy with a normal fasting level\u00a0\u00a0:)Let me know how your test came out!",

            "answer": "First, I have seen every endo in my big city. One told me I was too complicated, one misdiagosed me with pneumonia even though I was a nurse educator and knew I hadpneumonia he told me I was a hypochondriac, one talked to his golf buddy during my appt and then charged me by the number of minutes he sat in the room. Another at a university prescribed Synthroid even though I explained I could not take it and when I did and almost died the office said they cold see me in two months. My current doctor\u00a0\u00a0has given me an appt for 6 months even though I will run out of meds.\u00a0\u00a0Hear is a news flash most endos do NOT care about thyroids and are not very well trained in this!!! MOST want diabetic patients because that is where the money is. My son has had diabetes for 21 years and even with good care is losing his sight. Doctors do suck but they really don't know very much about thyroids as it is a low level priority in med school. I really want to write a book about thyroid and patients with thyroid disease for doctors. I hope all of you will be up for stories when I finally get the energy.",
