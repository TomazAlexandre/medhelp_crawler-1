The success rate varies from individual to individual. Also you should not have any underlying disease causing fat deposition such as diabetes, hypothyroidism, high cholesterol etc. Please discuss with your specialist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
