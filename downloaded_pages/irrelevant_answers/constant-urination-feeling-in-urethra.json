            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to urethritis or urethral syndrome. It is a primarily female syndrome in which women suffer from irritative bladder symptoms (urinary frequency, urgency, burning , and a hesitant or slowed urinary stream) in the absence of any objective urologic findings.In this the diagnosis can be made only by the proper collections of urine specimens from both the urethra and the bladder. These specimens will reveal the presence of white blood cells in the urethral washings, while the midstream (bladder) specimen will be free of cells.Also other possibilities need to be ruled out. The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are interstitial cystitis,overactive bladder syndrome,stroke and other neurological diseases,urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .I sincerely hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I am a 21yr. old female and for the past 2 months I have had the constant feeling of having to urinate. The feeling is in my urethra only, and when I urinate I am able to empty my bladder completely. I have been to the doctor 5 times and have had test and cultures that all came back normal. I have avoided all bladder irritants since the first sign of this, except alcohol which is the only thing that makes me feel back to normal. The urologist took\u00a0\u00a0a scan of my bladder and found it to be empty after i went to the bathroom. I cannot sit still or stand still, and i am currently on oxybutinin which only helps the spasms. It does not help with the constant feeling to urinate. I was told by the urologist that if the oxybutinin doesnt work, then i need to see my regular doctor because she can no longer help me. I just want to feel normal again like everyone else. I feel like no one is listening to me and no one cares. Please help.",
