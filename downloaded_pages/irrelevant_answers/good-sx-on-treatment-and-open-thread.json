            "answer": "You're the first person I've heard of whose skin got *better* on treatment, but hey, congratulations!The only *good* thing about treatment I can think of is that it ended :)Oh wait, maybe, it gave me permission to eat a lot of high-fat \"comfort\" foods because of my weight loss. Now I'm back on a lower fat, lower protein, more complex carb, more health oriented diet. I\u00a0\u00a0 occasionally do miss my scrambled eggs, bacon, home fries and buttered toast treatment diet (now it's oatmeal, banana, skim milk, egg whites)but after going through treatment, it doesn't seem that much of a hardship.So, yes, that's another good thing about treatment. Treatment\u00a0\u00a0taught me I'm a lot stronger than I thought -- and small sacrifices like eating healthier (if you want to call it a sacrifice) are really not that big a deal anymore. Not after a diet of Peg and riba.-- Jim",

            "answer": "Yes, please elaborate on the diabetes and any medical connections. Also, were there any lifestyle/diet changes (including weight loss) that could have been the actual reason.Also, are you familiar with Metabolic Syndrome. Curious, how many components of metabolic syndrome do you have and did anything else improve. I have a tendency toward high cholesterol, low HDL, high triglicerides, and high bp. My NP suggests that metabolic syndrome can result in fatty liver which in her opinion is as much a threat to fibrotic progression (even more actually) than the virus itself.On metabolic syndrome: http://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4756",

            "answer": "Was dx'd with diabetes a few months before tx started. Since it developed in my 50's, strictly speaking, it was type 2 with relatively low doses of insulin daily. Did not have a real carppy diet, not overweight, not a drinker and fairly active.\u00a0\u00a0All blood sugar levels went to normal during tx - coinciding with a clear pcr. 'Blood sugar abnormalities' are a fairly common sidecar to hcv.\u00a0\u00a0Had blood drawn Friday for an endocrine doc appt tomorrow and expect all readings will still be normal.\u00a0\u00a0As I've said before, I believe hcv gave me the diabetes and being clear took it away. But, also focused a little more on more healthy eating/living too.",

Someone mentioned a few weeks back that low cholesteral, ldl specifically, could have been one of the HCV 'pointers' (my term).\u00a0\u00a0I do have hi BP which has not abated since end tx - I guess that one's with me for good, or until I quit smoking.",
