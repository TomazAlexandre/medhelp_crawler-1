            "answer": "Hi Dan, I am new to this forum so your post is a few weeks old. I hope you are still a part of it. I wholeheartingly agree with what JDRF said. This is a very difficult time for you...just being in high school can be hard enough and now to have diabetes as well can appear to be overwhelming...but not impossible. If your friends are not supportive of you and your choices not to drink and smoke than YOU ARE HANGIN WITH THE WRONG CROWD. If you feel you need to party because they want you to and you give in to that pressure than:#1. THEY obviously do not care about you and,#2. YOU obviously do not care about you....;.If you are feeling that much peer pressure than you are also having alot of unneccesary stress. And stress will up your numbers just as fast as a candy bar or worse...an alcholic drink. You need to dig (and hopefully not too deep) within yourself and ask what is more important...your health or the partying. Maybe it is time to think of yourself first. Have you thought about joining a school or county sports team. I know in high school they pretty much only want the best of the best, but city or county leagues support and encourage teenagers of all skill levels...and there are new friends to be made too. Exercise is one of the best ways to help your sugar levels. You may find that you are an awesome quarterback or pitcher or swimmer or wrestler...etc... Also, what about joining a youth group at a church. Support is critical for you at this time and I know you will find it in a youth group...and again, new friends will be made. You will be surprised to see how much fun teenagers have over the weekends...and without the drinking and smoking. You may find a person inside yourself that you never knew and guess what???...even like that person. You can do this...and BTW...prayer is a powerful thing.My dad was a type 1 diabetic. He did not take care of himself and partying his teenage years away (and into his early twenties) was more important to him than anything else. He paid for it though. He went blind, went on dialysis, his brother gave him a kidney, lost a few toes and then his leg and then died at 48 from a heart attack. He did not have the tools back then to monitor his levels and relied on doctors only to help him manage...but it was too late...the damage was already done. You have the tools...use them...poking fingers and shots are a lot less painful than 'running' into a wall ... because you could not see it, or horribly infected sores on your feet that would not heal, or the physical and emotional pain of losing a leg. Let me ask you this...if you KNEW that the car you were about to get into was going to get into an accident and you KNEW you were going to lose a leg or worse...die...would you get in it?\u00a0\u00a0Of course you wouldn't.\u00a0\u00a0So why would you want to go on a wild ride with your diabetes KNOWING what the outcome WILL be.Dan you have got to stand up and take control NOW!!! Nothing is more important than your health. Throw yourself into support groups online and in person. Start with your mom...you could educate each other and be the best support group right there. Go from there and be an advocate...educate yourself completely on your disease and then educate other teenagers who are facing the same hardships as you.\u00a0\u00a0You will be a hero and have more supportive friends than you will know what to do with.BTW...I also am a diabetic and am struggling with some things too...but I will not give up till I have my health under control...YOU CAN DO THIS...keep me informed please...good luck...",

    "question": "hi im new to the whole diabetes thing, its been 3 weeks about, my friends are kind of the party group, i kno that drinking is bad for it because when i was younger a neighbor had to be rushed to the hopsital because he drank alot at a party and had type 1 diabetes and from what i was told nearly lost his life..... so i was thinking of just smoking marijuana occasionally but was wondering the dangers besides just getting the munchies.so my questions are1. Dangers of smoking marijuana with diabetes besides just munchies ( such as blood sugar levels and such)2. does it honestly get easier, right now after 3 weeks its still just as like painful for me to be pricking my finger non stop and taking shots.... ive been told it gets easier but only by people who dont even have diabetes and my mother who has it but only tells me what i want to hear.3. how bad is drinking honestly w/ diabetes? i was told by people that you just cant get drunk but you can still like have a beer or two or somethingnow i kno the first solution to all of this is just not to do them... but im being completely honest, im a teenager. and at my high school this really is what people do every weekend. so insteand of just going out and doing these things i figured i would see others experiences and advice first.thank you all so muchim so glad i found this site.Dan",
