            "answer": "Hi there!Treatment of active tendonitis involves limiting the movement around the joint to provide rest to the tendon, while anti-inflammatory medications/ measures may be used occasionally. You could try using a crepe bandage that would help decrease the mobility slightly. Regular physiotherapy is something that may be beneficial as well.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "Tossing teddybears with pre-schoolers is a not-to-be-missed activity but I pay dearly in tendonitis and the pains often last even into the next day.\u00a0\u00a0Pushing grocery carts also brings it on and Walmart's heavy ones are really killers.It occurs to me that\u00a0\u00a0warming up somehow might help?P.S. Physical Therapist two years ago said I can no longer use even 1 lb weights with my left arm; and the right was limited to 2 lb. (I'm right-handed.)",
