            "answer": "I'm having a section due to other medical issues including previous section and my bubs weighed over 5 at my 32 week ultrasound... Don't forget ultrasounds can be off by up to a pound so your bubs could be the average 3.5lb baby. Also my aunt is super tiny and had a 10.5lb baby 3 years ago with no medical assistance.",

            "answer": "I had vaginal deliveries for both my boys.... oldest was 8lb 4.5oz and my youngest was 9lb 12.8oz. (I also did not have gestational diabetes...which I get asked all the time). Talk to your Dr about your concerns. My doctor had complete confidence I could deliver a big baby. I actually just talked to her about this current pregnancy b/c typically each baby gets bigger... lol We really are much stronger than sometimes we give ourselves credit for. I hope you have an awesome doctor or mw that'll encourage you. :-) and fyi... there is a margin of error on u/s up to two pounds either way, so baby may not be as big as you think. :-)",

My ob said he should 'even out' but there has been zero talk of a c section. They should be discussing that around 36 weeks in my opinion. I think it's too soon to know now.",
