The air fall should stop once the inflammation settles. Please consult a skin specialist.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

Maybe even mites that were on the gnats may be the culprit. Mom seems to also be allergic to shellfish, which are also arthropods.\u00a0\u00a0I believe the 3 biggest systemic causes of hair loss are hormonal imbalance, diabetes, and poor thyroid function, but it seems none of these would cause scalp dermatitis.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is an allergy and the swarm of gnats getting in the hair prior to any hair loss symptoms, seems definitely related.",
