            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Your symptoms could be due to UTI, or urinary tract infection. The infection could be at any level from bladder to ureter to kidney. It could also be due to a stone in the urinary tract. You need to get your urine examined for infection. What you need is a urine culture and sensitivity test done. This will tell you what organism is causing the infection and what antibiotic will kill it permanently. Cranberry juice and apple cider though will not cure the UTI, can help reduce the symptoms and can be taken along with the medication.However increased frequency of urine is also seen in diabetis mellitus and diabetes insipidus. You must talk to your physician regarding all these possibilities. You would need some more tests beside urine analysis to reach a confirmed diagnosis.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
