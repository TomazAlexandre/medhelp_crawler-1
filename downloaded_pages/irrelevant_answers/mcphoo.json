            "answer": "Hey!\u00a0\u00a0All is NOT lost here...A number of meds for depression also help with neuropathy by decreasing pain receptors, and you can decrease any more problems developing with diet and good blood sugar control.Have you seen an endocrenologist and/or diabetes specialist and maybe more importantly a nutritionist/dietician familiar with diabetes who can help you find a food regimen best for you?\u00a0\u00a0If not, please try it... c'mon, the worst thing that could happen is that it doesn't help, but I really doubt that, and regardless, if you're feeling bad now, why not seek out someone that can possibly help...Our most basic functions include eating, so why not see someone who might be able to help you find a way of eating that can help you?\u00a0\u00a0And as diabetics, what we eat is really important and can have a surprisingly amazing impact on our blood sugars, health, energy levels, and emotional states.If pain is the main issue for you, please ask for and/or seek out a pain specialist; there are so many amazing and low-risk treatment meds and therapies available now...Best to you...",

    "question": "I have type 2 diabetes and also have peripheral or diabetic neuropathy along with epilepsy, high BP and depression. Any chance of reversal with the neuropathy? Any way to stop progression of nerve damage and pain? I have no feeling in my feet and now it started with my hands. I feel as I lost all hope and just want to end it all because a slow death is not what I want. A lot of encouragement would help along with some positive answers. I only wish.",
