            "answer": "Hi, how high is the temperature? Usually if there is a fever that means the body is trying to fight an infection. Did they do any blood work, to see white blood cells and so on? But anything over 101-102 is moderate but you would definitely want to go to the doctor. How is her diet, is she following a strict diet?Other conditions can cause a fever, including allergic reactions; autoimmune diseases; trauma, cancer; excessive exposure to the sun; intense exercise; hormonal imbalances; certain drugs; and damage to the hypothalamus. When an infection occurs, fever-inducing agents called pyrogens are released, either by the body's immune system or by the invading cells themselves, that can trigger the resetting of the thermostat. In other circumstances, the immune system may overreact (allergic reactions) or become damaged (autoimmune diseases), causing the uncontrolled release of pyrogens. A stroke or tumor can damage the hypothalamus, causing the body's thermostat to malfunction.How long a fever lasts and how high it may go depends on several factors, including its cause, the age of the patient, her overall health. Most fevers caused by infections are acute, appearing suddenly and then dissipating as the immune system defeats the infectious agent. An infectious fever may also rise and fall throughout the day, reaching its peek in the late afternoon or early evening. A low-grade fever that lasts for several weeks is associated with autoimmune diseases.",

            "answer": "Hi thanks for replying ...I would just brief you the complete case history as to have a better insight of how whats all happening right from the beginning .My mother has type2 diabetes and she takes medicines for that\u00a0\u00a0along with diet maintainance.so far no complaints of high blood pressure or any other associated acomplications of it.She had been complaining of some change in her bowel habits from last 2-3 months as of having constipation some day while diarrhoe some other day.Around a month before she started having fever betwwen 101-102 deg and complained of lower left abdominal pain.The sonography of the abdominal part was instructed and it signified swelling in large intestine and possibility of sigmoid colon diverticulitis.The medications for the same were started and with that mere 2\u00a0\u00a0days dosage her abdominal pain went away.But no change in fever was seen .In the meantime CT scan of the abdomen and Colonoscopy were performed , and to all shock report of both of them were pretty NORMAL.She had her urine test done which revealed urinary tract infection for which she was given antibiotics.Her blood test was also conducted and\u00a0\u00a0in that everything else was normal except increase in WBC count(point to note is that Neutrophils count in was high before UTI medications but it came back in normal range later on).Her typhoid test is negative and she was also put on antimalarial drugs dosage for 3 days as it was suspected too keeping in mind that all other reports were coming normal.But no change in fever trend is noted till date.If given high paracetomol dose ,fever comes down completely and recurrs after 6-7 hrs and if lower dosage paracetomol is given it comes down till 99 deg only and then slowly picks up again.One\u00a0\u00a0Important thing to note is that since my nanny died of cancer.We make it a point to rule out its possibility too but complete body scan is done and no trace of any devolpment of cancerous cells could be made anywhere.",
