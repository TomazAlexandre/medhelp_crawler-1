            "answer": "Has she tried doing without medication?She may cope better without especially if she has a very good diet.No tea or coffee as this is a duretic and can damage her kidneys which are probably already damaged from long-term medication u see.\u00a0\u00a0Just water. Try living on a lot of fresh fruit and vegetables.She must come of the medication very slowly to prevent withdrawal symptoms. The brain has to adjust to the different levels of serotonin and dopamine.[the chemicals that alters the brain mood] If she takes it very slowly coming off the brain heals and adjusts.",

            "answer": "She should never change her medications in any way without her doctor first giving the OK and that he has supervision of her.As you said, she is too sick to be messing with anything at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Don't make any more waves than what she is going through at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0Let her doctor manage her condition to the best of his ability.In time, after she is stable once more, if her medications are still not really helping her stability, then maybe you may want to discuss it with a psychopharmacologist.\u00a0\u00a0Her doctor may refer her to one, or you may need to find one on your own.\u00a0\u00a0But it is important to work closely with her current doctor giving him any information about her that may help him to help her better.Remember, do no changes in medications without first discussing it with her doctor and only with his OK and supervision.\u00a0\u00a0Never do anything behind his back.\u00a0\u00a0That is very counterproductive and dangerous for her.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0K",
