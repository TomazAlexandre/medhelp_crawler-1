    "question": "I am searching for information on decompensation in people with Hepatitis C who have developed Cirrhosis.\u00a0\u00a0Can stressors such as illness, injury, accidents cause a stable condition to suddenly decompensate and require a liver transplant?\u00a0\u00a0I am having trouble finding documentation that says decompensation can happen because that is the \"nature\" of cirrhosis.\u00a0\u00a0Anything from small amount of alcohol, fatty liver, obesity, diabetes can cause decompensation.\u00a0\u00a0Any of these things on a liver with cirrhosis is \"like putting gasoline on a fire.\"\u00a0\u00a0I have been told this by medical professionals, but I can't find this information in writing.\u00a0\u00a0Any help out there?Thank you.",
