            "answer": "Hi pixi and welcome to our little MS community,You have MS as well as diabetes, so both your central and peripheral nervous system is compromised, so basically either could be causing you this problem. It's bilateral and if it's happening at exactly the same time, in exactly the same way in both wrists, it's also possible to be a structural spinal issue but because bilateral wrist/hand pain and numbness is a common diabetic issue i would think it's more likely caused by your peripheral nervous issues due to the diabetes.I would definitely speak to your dr about it but I personally don't think it's a medical emergency.Cheers...........JJ",

            "answer": "Hi Pixl -In addition to central or peripheral nervous system as the culprit,\u00a0\u00a0your symptoms could be related to circulation. I odon't know much about diabetes, but it does seem to cause some serious circulation problems.Kyle",

    "question": "I have been living with MS for 8 years and I have changed my meds 4 times. Recently I have developed a sharp pain in both of my wrists and my hands start to feel numb and 'go to sleep'. I also have diabetes and depression/anxiety. I was wondering can any of my conditions be contributing to my pain in my hands or do I have to see the doctor right away?",
