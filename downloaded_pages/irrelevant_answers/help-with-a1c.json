            "answer": "I agree with \"often\"... talk to a nutritionist...\u00a0\u00a0and in terms of A1C, there is no \"fast\" way to lower the result: A1C is a measure of the average glucose load in your blood for roughly the 3 months before the test.If your goal is being able to have a healthy baby (and a healthy pregnancy for yourself) remember those goals!\u00a0\u00a0Starving yourself would be one of the worst things you could do to yourself and your developing baby, especially as a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy often is challenging for diabetics who have good control to start with, so for you and your future baby, you want to be sure you have your 'not pregnant' diabetes under control before getting pregnant.A good nutritionist can help you get your diabetes (and A1C) under control, and also help you with the potential added challenges of optimal pre-natal vitamins and nutrition as a (future) pregnant diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Nutritionists (good ones who have knowledge about diabetes, and especially diabetic pregnancy issues) are not cheap, and sadly not always covered by insurance plans, BUT... can you really put a dollar price on doing everything you can do to help you to have a healthy pregnancy, and especially, a healthy baby?And, again, \"often\" is right... a dietary and exercise regimen is absolutely required for any of us to have relatively stable blood sugars (and A1C)... I would also add that for us that FIBER is hugely beneficial: it adds to a sense of fullness, slows digestion, helps regulate blood sugar, helps with cholesterol, and yeah, helps with bathroom habits, too...If you can, find an OB (obstetrician) who specializes or at least has experience with diabetic pregnancy before you get pregnant and consult with her/him about your specific situation.Good Luck!",
