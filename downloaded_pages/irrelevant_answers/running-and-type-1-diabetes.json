            "answer": "I am not a physician, but a volunteer and the mom of a type 1 diabetic.I would suggest you call your son's endocrinologist or CDE (certified diabetic educator). I would go over your sons training schedule, school schedule and meets.\u00a0\u00a0 They would be the best to advise you as to how much your son should eat as a snack before hand and how to regulate his insulin for meets.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise and stress can lower Blood sugars so your son might require less insulin and more carbs. I would also discuss with your sons coach on what he needs to do for his diabetes, and I would also make sure that he knows how to use a glucagon if needed.Since your son is active in sports I would also make sure that what the doctor states is put in to your sons 504 school plan so that they accommodate all his needs not just academically , but for sports also.",
