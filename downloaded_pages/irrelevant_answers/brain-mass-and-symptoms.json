One can't be wrong or control it usually.I'm not a Dr. but feel 6 mos to 1 yr. are reasonable time frames for repeat MRI.I don't know about CFS and all your symptoms, as would consider diabetes as causing some of the feelings; Esp, numbness and tingling ( diabetic peripheral neuropathy ). Maybe some of the other feelings also. Needed, is to keep your blood sugar in check!Where is the mass located in the brain? Is it a white matter lesion?CT scans reveal bone better than soft tissue, so no surprise there.Just some thoughts...Russ",

            "answer": "I just got the neurologist about a couple of months back.\u00a0\u00a0The endocrinoligist came into the picture about 2 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0But they are finding out more and more.\u00a0\u00a0My doctors are not 100% on board with how this is playing a role.\u00a0\u00a0But I have found people who specialize with tumors in that area of the brain.\u00a0\u00a0It does appear that the tumor is the cause of many of my issues.\u00a0\u00a0But it is not common.\u00a0\u00a0Only a couple of hundred people in the US, if that many, have the condition that I do.\u00a0\u00a0I am getting alot of good support from a hospital that specializes in this.I know that there are no easy answers in medicine for many cases.\u00a0\u00a0But I would tell anyone that they need to advocate for themselves.\u00a0\u00a0Had I allowed a doctor to try to convince me to just accept Chronic Fatigue as a diagnosis or to say I was depressed when I knew that I wasn't I would not have many of the answers that I do now.\u00a0\u00a02 and a half years of this and just found out that my testosterone levels are low.\u00a0\u00a0And the doctors have not addressed many of my endocrine issues.\u00a0\u00a0But now that I have a solid starting point we know what to look at.I guess anxious was not the right choice of words.\u00a0\u00a0Excited and interested may have been better.\u00a0\u00a0I do feel that people should use resources like this if they are not satisfied with the medical treatment that they are receiving.\u00a0\u00a0I appreciate the responses.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome(Fatigue, Numbness and tingling,....).\u00a0\u00a0I have high blood pressure, sleep apnea, hypothyroidism and developed type 2 diabetes about a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have been sick for a couple of years.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms were not all explained by the diagnosis' that I have.\u00a0\u00a0Thus the CFS diagnosis.I had an MRI done this week.\u00a0\u00a0They noted a small mass on my brain.\u00a0\u00a0It was described as benign.\u00a0\u00a0It had not shown up on the CT Scan done over a year ago.So here is what I am wondering.1)Could this be the thing that explains the symptoms from the CFS diagnosis?2)Is 6 months til the rescan too passive?3)After 2 years of disability, am I wrong to be anxious to explore the details and impact that this has and will have on my life?",
