I always Gerard of woman doing it for years.. its not that bad you drink this drink which comes in different flavors than wait like 30 mins and have your blood taken. It needs to be done because if you end up with\u00a0\u00a0diabetes the doctor and wait it and make sure everything is OK. I have to have it done on the 30th and had it done with my other two kids.. good luck",

            "answer": "I didn't have it done with my first either. But you just need to drink a drink the nurse or doctor gives you and get your blood taken out. It takes an hour. If all goes well, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to redo it another day but that's a three hour test. If you fail that, then you have gestational diabetes. :)",
