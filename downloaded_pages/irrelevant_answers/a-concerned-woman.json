            "answer": "I went to my Doctor Thursday 3/31/11 and was told that it could be Musculoskeletal disorder and that an MRI needs to be done but now.. that I am pregnant I am unable too do the MRI, I would have to wait till after the pregnancy. I went back to my Doctor this Monday 4/4/11 for a followup and was told now that it could be a pinched nerve got sent home to do exercise and if I continue to be in pain then I'll have to wait and just bare the pain. I miss work, but I also love spending time with my other children. I want to thank you both BigSissie and Texaspharmicist for replying to my message I truly appreciate it. We'll see in time, I will keep posting.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This looks like nerve compression, may be you have a retroverted uterus pressing. Yes, endometriosis can cause pelvic pain but rarely it radiates to the legs.Consult your gynecologist. Check for high blood pressure and diabetes. If you are pregnant, then MRI, CT scan etc will need to be avoided.Hence, the cause of the pain will have to be diagnosed by clinical examination. Take care!",

I was at work when myboss had told me that they are taking me to the ER,at the ER they did urine, ultrasound and pelvic exam, I did find out that I am pregnant (early pregnancy). They had told me that they did\u00a0\u00a0not find anything out of the ordinary and did not understand why Im feeling pain only probably due to pregnancy and to follow up with my Doctor. My question is could this be endimetrioses or what could this be?? Please help if anyone knows or has gone through this??Sincerely,Ana",
