            "answer": "Did you tell the lab that you weren't fasting? I personally don't see all that much value in a random glucose test because it doesn't establish much. That being said, though your numbers were well in line even for fasting. In fasting tests, under 100 is considered normal, 100-125 pre-diabetes and 126 and over diabetes. Since you do have some reactions to foods I would just test it yearly or so, and like you already do, stay away from sugar. Better for your health anyway!",

            "answer": "Random glucose testing is a waste of time. The result of the test only shows for the moment when the test is undertaken and tells nothing on how your body handles, or has handled blood sugar [glucose]. You need to take a fasting glucose test [no eating 8-10 hrs prior] AND an A1c [HA1c, HgbA1c]. The former provides a picture on how well your body is currently handing blood glucose, the latter provides a picture on how well your body has managed/controlled blood glucose over the past 2-3 months. Don't delay rescheduling these tests as your symptoms mimic diabetes.",

    "question": "I recently had a blood test, which included a glucose test. I wasn't fasting. I ate a bowl of whole grain cereal at about 5AM. My test was a 10AM.My uncle has diabetes and my sister is hypoglycemic. I know I get sick if I have a shake from McDonalds, but that's about it. I get really tired and nauseated. I don't drink sugary beverages at all just because I am always watching my weight, but I wonder now how that would effect me?The blood test results stated that my blood glucose is normal, but the lab ranges were between 65-99 and my result was 95. Should I be concerned?",
