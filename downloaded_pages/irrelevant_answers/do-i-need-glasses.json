            "answer": "You need an medical eye examination with an Eye MD physician (ophthalmologist). The purpose of this exam will be to determine if you have any eye diseases causing your symptoms, if there are any diseases of the whole body (such as diabetes or high blood pressure) that are causing your symptoms and finally whether you need glasses.If you have the above type of examination and everything is healthy and you don't need glasses, then you are a very lucky person and shouldn't feel your money was wasted.If you have a problem and it's diagnosed and treated then once again you got your money's worth.Trying to save money on your eye care is false economy.JCH III MD Eye MD",

    "question": "I have trouble seeing at night and things that are far away.\u00a0\u00a0I generally don't have difficulty seeing the projector in lecture halls, even from the back, although in some rooms I need to sit more toward the front.\u00a0\u00a0I also get headaches and squint a lot from watching TV, no matter how close or far away I am sitting.\u00a0\u00a0The other day I was watching TV and it was blurry so I moved up thinking it would be better and it didn't change at all.\u00a0\u00a0I took an at-home eye test that I printed out and I can decipher the 20/10 line from 10 feet away (which should be normal) if I strain and it's really blurry.\u00a0\u00a0I made an eye appointment but I am worried that I will get there and they will tell me that since I can make out the letters on the normal line, I don't need glasses.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to spend money on an eye exam for nothing and I really do want to correct my vision, even if it's not that much worse than normal.I guess what I am asking is will they go by the line on the chart that I can read clearly, or the one I can still decipher even though it's blurry.",
