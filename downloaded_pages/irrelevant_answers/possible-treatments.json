            "answer": "Most dietary methods have been aimed at Breast, Colon, and Prostate cancers. For those cancers in general, maintaining an appropriate weight and exercise seem to perform better than any specific dietary intervention. There is a case report of a doctor in South Africa with CLL who conducted experiments on himself using Vitamin D, although it is difficult to measure how large the benefit from Vit D was. Novel drugs based on Vitamin D are being tested, but the work is still in early phases, so again it is difficult to predict outcomes.\u00a0\u00a0In a practical sense, you could follow dietary advice to prevent diabetes and cardiovascular disease, there is no reason to believe that such diets could worsen CLL. Exercise could be as simple as walking targeting a cumulative time of 3 hours per week.",
