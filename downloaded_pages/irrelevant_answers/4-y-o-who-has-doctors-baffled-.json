    "question": "Hi All, I am a new member to this forum and as with most need some help regarding my 4 y/o niece\u2019s condition. I would appreciate any comments, thoughts, questions or areas that we should explore and any professional opinions on this extremely sick child. In a nutshell, this little girl has medicine baffled in Northern Ireland!P.HxChloe is a 4 y/o girl who has Type 1 Diabetes. Apart from that she was a fit and healthy child.F.HxChloe is the 3rd of 5 Children. Her older brother of 6 has Eczema and Asthma; her younger brother of 2 has Eczema. The remaining children are fit and healthy. Her mum is again fit and healthy with no major medical history.\u00a0\u00a0 Her Dad, again like the rest of the family is fit and well apart from suffering Encephalitis 10 years ago.EventsOn Sunday 16th December at 0500, Mum and Dad were wakened out of their sleep by their 6 y/o son saying that Chloe was making funny noises. When they went into her room, they found that Chloe was foaming at the mouth and was having mild-moderate seizure. They immediately called an ambulance and tested her BM in case she was Hypoglycaemic. Her BM was recorded at 2.3. She was transferred to the Regional Paediatric ED and all her vital signs were stable. Her BM had come up to 5.3 and had a GCS of 6 (M=4, V=1, E=1). She was transferred to a ward to observation. She continued to have mild seizures lasting approx 1-2 minutes and then a decision was taken to move her to P.ICU. As she was able to maintain her own airway, intubation was not required. She remained in P.ICU for 7 days where she remained stable. MRI, CT, X-rays, Bloods, Lumbar Puncture, EEG\u2019s were all carried out to determine an illness. ALL OF THESE TESTS CAME BACK CLEAR! Chloe was moved after 7 days back to a General Ward when her GCS came back up to 9 (M=5, V=2, E=2) From what I can see, Chloe cannot hear, see or talk any comprehensible words. She is constantly grinding her teeth (Bruxism) and is just constantly babbling. Her eyes are open but is not focusing on anything around her, she is P.E.A.R.R.L but there is no blinking as a reaction. She is restless in bed. Her latest EEG has shown that there is Low Brain Activity however all other tests remain CLEAR!If anyone can help please contact me through this forum. If you have any questions, please ask me and I will answer them. As you can appreciate this is a really distressing situation for the family and the not knowing really does not help!Thank you all for reading this and to those of you who contact me (in advance), I thank you!Nick",
