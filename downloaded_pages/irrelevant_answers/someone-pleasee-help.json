            "answer": "If this were me, I think I would go to a GI doctor or Internal Medicine doctor. Admittedly, it could be anxiety but I would want to look at some other causes first such as stomach problems or even heart rhythm problems...Before I did that though, I think I would try an Allergy Avoidance Diet and see if that helps.What are you eating?\u00a0\u00a0Some people just can't eat sugary foods or high carbohydrate foods (think processed food - sometimes referred to as \"white\" foods) and sometimes you can have a food intolerance - like an allergy - that can cause weird symptoms. Oddly enough, you generally crave the foods you are allergic to. So, if this was me, I would start by going on a food allergy diet - where you don't eat any of the foods people are commonly allergic to - for at least 4-6 weeks and see if you feel better.\u00a0\u00a0Wheat is a common allergen so you will need to read a lot of labels - it is in most everything. (You could look for gluten free foods to get away from wheat.)\u00a0\u00a0Keep your foods simple - the less processed the better. So, raw vegetables, fruit, plain meats - and no fast sugar loads like candy, ice cream, pastries, processed cereals..

            "answer": "if you are feeling hungry, weak and shakey then it might refer to that you are over producing insulin and therefore you do not have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes means that you produce less insulin than the body demands (type 2) or the body don't produce anything insulin at all (type 1).\u00a0\u00a0However, if the pancreas keeps over producing insulin, then it could lead to decreased production of insulin over time (Diabetes) as the pancreas has been working too hard.\u00a0\u00a0A question about your food.\u00a0\u00a0What type of food are you consuming?\u00a0\u00a0if you have foods that have a high glycemic index (such as candys, white grain products, things that are instant etc) then you would feel more hungry faster as these items do turn into sugar in the body very quickly which again demands lots of insulin from the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend you to have lower glycemic index foods such as brown rice, whole wheat bread..foods that takes more time to be digested by the body (foods that are brown, not process, things needed to be cooked).\u00a0\u00a0Because these food releases sugar into the body slower, then you pancreas won't produce too much insulin and therefore not making you hungry quicker.\u00a0\u00a0About your anxiety question, yes sometimes it can cause these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0When you are anxious, your body requires more sugar to function and therefore quickly uses up all the sugar in your body leading to being hungry early.\u00a0\u00a0And sometimes feeling shaky and weak as your blood sugar is low.\u00a0\u00a0i would recommend you to test your blood sugar whenever feeling those symptoms, (the blood sugar is most likely to be lower than 4mmol/L) and have 15 grams of simples sugar (1 tablespoon of honey; 3/4 cup of juice/regular pop; 3 packets of sugar; 6 lifesavers) to bring your blood sugar up as fast as it can.\u00a0\u00a0then you would check blood sugar 15 minutes after, if above 4mmol/L then you would have a snack (cracker with cheese; or half of a sandwich with peanut butter) if you next meal is more than 1/2 hour away to maintain your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0however, you should get it checked and investigated no matter what.\u00a0\u00a0 hope this helps!",
