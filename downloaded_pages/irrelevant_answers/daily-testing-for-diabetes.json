            "answer": "\"Should I be concerned about this?\"Yes, very much.\"My doctor discourages daily blood glucose testing..\"Nuts and quacks have many disguises, some as doctors. Please go find another doctor and get a second opinion. To discourage glucose testing is unheard of. And then to make you feel guilty? Sad. I take that back, run away from this woman doctor as fast as you can. Find one that will listen to you and treat you properly for this one isn't.Fasting glucose over 300 is extremely high and dangerous, even more so after you've taken your meds. A good doctor will order an HgbA1c or HbA1c that measures your glucose over the past three months. This way the doctor can see what your body has been going thru and can prescribe the right medication dosage and treatment. Be sure to discuss your present medication, their doses, what you like or don't like about them, whether they are doing anything for you, and be sure to discuss any new meds the new doctor may be thinking of prescribing for you. Its time you took control of your life and get your diabetes under control.",
