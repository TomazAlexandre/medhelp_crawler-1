            "answer": "I do have fertility coverage, and they dont cover donor egg, donors take about 7 to 8k, agencies take nearly 5k, so close to 13 to 15k goes from us, insurance does cover the meds and procedures done on us. I may also have to go for donor, i too wish like you that baby comes from my egg, but it may not matter, when we have the baby, i read somewhere \"all we take is a single cell from a woman, we build it, we nurture it, we give it blood and we help it grow 9 months\", we should forget here about DNA and gene code.",

    "question": "Does anyone know if donor eggs are covered by insurance , or what would the cost be? My Re wants me to go with donor eggs, and she's going to check me for diabetes, i don't think i am.. No one in my immediate family ever was, and my grandmother became diabetic at age 85?lol... I know it is very hard to improve egg quality, but it would be nice if our child had a piece of both of us.. Thanks to allBD!",
