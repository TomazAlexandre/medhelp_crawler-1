            "answer": "Most depressions are medical conditions that require medical help for improvement.Like any other medical condition, you can go without treatment and hope for the best.Many times depression will 'recede' or get better on it's own but it's a not necessary to suffer with this condition when there is good treatment available.\u00a0\u00a0If it does recede it will frequently return again.An individual's family physician can frequently treat depression, but going to a psychiatrist is the best method.Suffering with this without help is needless and unnecessary.\u00a0\u00a0It's like having diabetes or a heart condition and not seeking help for it.\u00a0\u00a0 A big gamble with little chance of winning.Why avoid professsional help???",
