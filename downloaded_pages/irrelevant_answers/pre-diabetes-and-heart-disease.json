            "answer": "Hi peljbl,Very appropriate questions given your circumstances.I just wanted to comment on your statement \"besides the side effects of the Lipitor.\"You should not be having muscle pains from lipator.\u00a0\u00a0If you are, you need to stop it and talk to your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0The confounder that commonly comes up is that people often start exercising and statins around the same time -- muscle aches are normal if you just getting back into shape.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to tease out these differences.\u00a0\u00a0One approach would be to start diet and exercise, and then start the statin a few weeks to a month or two later. It is also possible your symptoms are from stopping the estrogen patch.\u00a0\u00a0Remember the battle against coronary disease is not one of days or months but years.\u00a0\u00a0If it takes 3-4 months to start all your medications and start them one at a time, so be it.\u00a0\u00a0You will not be losing ground and you may feel more secure in the decision to be on medications.Do you think it is possible to control the glucose - which runs between 100-126 and the lipids by diet and exercise alone?In some people yes.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to know is to try first.Taking medications is not fun, but there are proven benefits to many of the medications or their effects (lower blood sugar).\u00a0\u00a0I would have a VERY LOW thrshold to put someone in your situation on metformin or glucophage.\u00a0\u00a0It does not cause hypoglycemia, decreases blood sugar and helps you lose weight.Are there any other options besides statins that can help?Is it absolutely necessary to do without the estrogen patch?The increased risk of coronary events with estrogen was predominantly in the first 6 weeks after starting the medication.\u00a0\u00a0There is a population that is more like to have clots with estrogen and this shows up very early in the medications use.\u00a0\u00a0There are some doctors that will not start new estrogen prescriptions but will not stop it on someone already on chronic estrogen.\u00a0\u00a0There is no right or wrong answers, just an informed decision about risks and beneftis.Do you think a consult with a cardiologist is appropriate?It would never hurt to see a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0In your situation, a preventative cardiologist seems particularly appropriate.Are there any other options besides statins that can help?statins are well studied to have significant benefits at decreasing future events.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know of replacement.\u00a0\u00a0Medications like zetia also lower cholesterol, but the studies show a survival or event benefit are not complete yet.I hope this answers most of\u00a0\u00a0your question.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for posting and good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi,First gastro dr said I need one to see wheather I have H. Pylori or not.\u00a0\u00a0My A-Fib could be related to.She mentioned that about the palpitations, what happen if can't stop?\u00a0\u00a0They didn't have all that heart equipments down at the endoscopy centre.\u00a0\u00a0I told her my pacemaker is working and it'll take all the risks.\u00a0\u00a0What happen if the palpitations over-write the pacemaker?\u00a0\u00a0Ehhh....She said when the anesthetic go in, the palp will start...\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to do it without the anesthetic.Now, I quere in the waiting list at the hospital that look after my heart.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen the gastro dr there but still haven't received the waiting list number yet.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know how you go with that.\u00a0\u00a0I've wpw.",

            "answer": "Not every obese person is insulin resistant, and vice versa.Fasting glucose of 100-125 is \"impaired\", 126 is actually diabetes (not pre-diabetes) if it happens more than once.HDL of 68 is outstanding, TG of 138 is normal/very good - this would argue very strongly against insulin resistance - even if you are taking statins - those numbers are just \"too good\".I've got IR, and have had HDL 11-38 and TG 200's-400's, which is more typical for IR patients. Also high blood pressure.Get a GTT + insulin levels - find out if you have IGT, IFG, type 2 diabetes and/or insulin resistance, or even an very early type 1.Also get complete blood work, cortisol, hormones, etc - they may be overlooking something.",

            "answer": "Referring to your post: I've had Diabetes type 2 since lastyear. I'm a female of 54 yrs of age. Had been off my hormone's for about 1 yr. Had the sweats, bitchiness, and sleep was not good. After learning of my Diabetes, found a great dr. Told him about my situation as far as the hormone's. He suggested to take Black Cohosh. I'm one that will try just about anything once to see if it really does work [well, depending on what it might be of course] : ) Anyway...I've been on Black Cohosh for about 4 months now and it works just fine for my symptoms I had. You only take it once in the morning w/a your meal and once at night w/your meal [capsule]. You can buy this at any health food store. I can get mine at the market. It's not expensive at all. I've read up on this on the web and it does say it can loose it's effectiveness after being on it for 6 months. Spoke to my dr. about that and he also said I could take 1 DHEA 25 mg a day. Have not started on that yet, but will when it's time to. Give it a week to start on the Black Cohosh to see some improvements : )Something I found out about the Hormone Therapy; While I was on the hormone pill, my heart rate was high sometimes 115 a min.[resting] After getting off the hormone's, my rate went to normal. The pharmacist told me the hormone's do increase your heart rate. Also...about your Diabetes. Exercise is excellent to keep your sugar level down to where it should be and of course to get weight down. I take [Metformin] 3 x a day, but Cinnamon I have added to my diet [capsule]. It's good for not only controlling your cholesterol, but for blood sugar also. I take 2 in the morning and 2 at night w/my meal. I also take [once in a while] the Starch Blocker. There are many out there I have read up on. The one that my Dr. recommended was the Carb Cutter Phase 2. It has the White Vanilla Bean Extract in it and that's what helps one out with breaking down your carbs. You can buy that at a health food store. Eating healthy w/exercise is the key. Since I learned of my Diabetes I have lost 76 lbs. I was overweight cause of a back injury. I could not have any surgery due to my side affects and allergic reactions to pain meds [just about ALL pain meds] Spine specialists will not touch me. Went through some pain management classes and that helped also in the long run to use my mind over the pain I have. So, not only doing the exercises, but eating the right way is what helps a greatdeal. I have NO sugar in my diet [even though one can], but I prefer not to...I have NO white flour of any kinds. No pasta anymore unless it's whole wheat. I eat whole grain breads low in carbs, lots of veggies, fruits and vitamins. As far as meat in my diet I have gotten used to not having meat, only fish now. I am between 160-163 right now with my weight w/30 more lbs to go and I'm 5'3. I was at 238 when I learned of my Diabetes last February. Please give the Black Cohosh a try. I have no side affects to this whatsoever. It's sure better than the patch.I wish you good luck : ) Dcat",
