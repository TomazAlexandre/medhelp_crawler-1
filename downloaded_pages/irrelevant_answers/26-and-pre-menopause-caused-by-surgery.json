            "answer": "I do have diabetes and it is being treated. My thyroid has been checked and I have no palpitations.I knew I would lose a lot of weight after pregnancy. I have had every blood test there is. My doctors have said I am pre-menopausal but wouldn't give me any information about it that is why I came on here to ask. I thought I would get some advice on pre menopause.",

    "question": "I am 26 years old and on July 22, 2010 I gave birth via c-section and at that time they removed my left ovary and tube along with 2 cysts. 1 was the size of a cantaloupe (4 lbs) and 1 was the size of a water balloon. In 2008 and 2007 they removed 3 cysts both times on each ovary. In 2008 they removed 1/4 of my right ovary. Lately I have experienced hot flashes, cold flashes, very thirsty, mood swings and severe weight loss. I was 146 lbs while pregnant and now I am 122 lbs. Are these symptoms normal? I have asked 2 doctors and they don't give me straight answers.",
