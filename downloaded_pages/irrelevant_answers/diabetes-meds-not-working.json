Proper weight.If you follow these three guidelines you will be amazed how much lower your glucose levels will be.Are you on regular or extended release Glipzide (Glucotrol XL)? I tend not to go with \"new\" drugs since the FDA has a habit of sometimes releasing meds before their time. I use the most common called Metformin (Glucophage).You may need to discuss with your doctor about either increasing your dose or switching medications since your medical records are in his/her possession.",

            "answer": "I agree with gpguyway that you should talk to your doctor. My understanding is that oral diabetes meds are generally used in combination, with most people taking two or three different types. Then for some people who are Type II the oral meds eventually stop working. We start out as being \"insulin resistent\" which means that our bodies produce enough insulin but aren't adept at using the insulin we produce. Hence the oral meds. But over time our bodies produce less and less insulin and then the oral meds are no longer effective and we need to begin insulin. It's not a bad thing, not \"getting worse\". It's a normal progression.",

            "answer": "Ask your physician to prescribe Metformin, which has a different mechanism of action.You can start at 500 mg twice a day, and move it up to 1000 mg. Try this med on your day off because sometimes it can drop sugar levels to the point where it affects driving.You should purchase Chromium GTF at your health food store. The \"GTF\" stands for glucose tolerance factor.You might also consider, if this doesn't work out, asking about a prescription for a long acting injectable insulin, that you can take once a day, to supplement the metformin. Be cautious about what you tell the department.",

He is going to be starting insulin asap.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to me it can get gradually worse over time, and get out of control, which is what this person has reached.
