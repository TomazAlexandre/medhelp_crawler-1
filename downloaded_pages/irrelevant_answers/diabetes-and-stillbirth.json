            "answer": "Hello,with well managed diabetes your baby's risk of still birth is extremely low (and similar to someone without diabetes).Please keep working very hard to keep your sugars as close to normal / normal as possible.\u00a0\u00a0This is important even as the delivery approaches.Your doctor should be monitoring you closely at this stage of your pregnancy. This may include doing some extra monitoring by ultrasound and what they call stress tests. If they are concerned regarding the baby they will induce it or deliver it by c-section.You can also monitor your baby's movements.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't feel movements or feel less than usual movements then you can call your doctor to discuss.You are very nearly there.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few days or a few weeks to go.I was diabetic with my last pregnancy, on insulin, and my baby was just fine.\u00a0\u00a0She was born at 38 weeks exactly.I am pregnant again with my second and so far everything is going very well.Please let us know how you go.",

            "answer": "Sounds like everything is going just as it should.\u00a0\u00a0And your doctor is monitoring you closely.\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors do like to induce their diabetic patients before 40 weeks and 39 weeks sounds pretty safe - that's if you don't go into labor before then on your own.My baby is due on 26th March.\u00a0\u00a0I have doppler study next month (32 weeks) after which they'll decide if I can go to term or if they will be monitoring more closely in case they want to induce.You'll be welcoming your new baby before you know it!Take care",
