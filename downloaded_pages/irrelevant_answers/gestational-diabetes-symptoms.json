    "question": "Has anyone had gestational diabetes and felt pretty ill/faint from it, especially after eating? I'm wondering if this can be a symptom?Lately I've been feeling very tired, and I think I just got thrush (both symptoms of GD). I've also been feeling very sick after meals, especially sugary/heavy carb meals... Like I feel like I see spots and get sweaty as though I'm about to faint, and can't breathe as easily - as though I'm about to have a panic attack. I get really fatigued and have to sit or lie down for most of the day, especially the hour or 2 after meals (breakfast is the worst).I had a big baby boy (10 pound 4) for my first birth and had these symptoms too but never got tested for GD(I'm generally fit, thin, healthy with no fam. history of GD). Next pregnancy was a girl and as I was now high risk for GD after a big baby I got the test. It was negative and she was more average sized (8 lb 12). But now I'm pregnant with a boy again and all the symptoms are back.I'm now scared to do the test in case that much of a sugar hit on an empty stomach makes me black out or get really sick. Just wondering if my symptoms point to GD or if it might be something completely different...",
