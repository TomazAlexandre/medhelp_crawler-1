            "answer": "HelloI am not a physician but I am the mother of a type 1 diabetic diagnosed at age 9. The fact that your daughter is showing these symptoms and feeling better after she eats is a dead ringer to me. Plus 60 is a bit on the low side. You never mention if after she eats does her blood levels shoot up or at any time is her blood high? If not perhaps she has hypoglycemia and not necessarily diabetes, this is treatable by eating several small meals and snacks.Also hypoglycemia can certainly cause a seizure, so it could be one in the same. I awoke the other night (about 3 weeks ago) to my middle son telling me that my eldest (the diabetic) was thrashing in his bed. I ran in to find him convulsing, eyes rolled back and lips purple. His teeth were clinched together so I had to put honey on my finger tips and rams my fingers down the sides of his cheeks. After a while he came out of it, but it was none the less scary.If she is taking medication for thyroid anyway then I would recommend seeing an endocrinologist asap, they are trained more in this arena than a general practitioner.Hope this helps",

            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0That doctor is wrong, 4 year olds can and do have hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0You don't say for sure that she has diabetes, but you're testing blood sugars and talking about the honeymoon, so I suspect she is.\u00a0\u00a0I would talk to a endocrinologost, not a neurologist, as the conditions you describe are exactly the conditions for hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0A hard day of playing will cause blood sugars to go low because the adrenaline in her system cause her muscles to absorb glucose without the need for insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroidism is a related disease to diabetes, as both the thyroid and the pancreas are glands that secrete proteins.\u00a0\u00a0When one is affected, there is a higher likelihood of problems with the other.\u00a0\u00a0An endocrinologost is who you need to talk to.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "She has juvenile diabetes in the honeymoon stage at this time blood sugars can drop and rise. Have an endocrinologist take a close look at her over a period of glucose intake she sounds type 1 to me. I have had type 1 diabetes for 30 years and was misdiagnosed the first 20 years of my life. Believe it or not. I almost died before I got insulin. I was in a honeymoon state and my sugars were fluctuating radically. A lot of type 1 will have hypoglycemia before their onset. Don't wait to have her checked you could save her kidneys and eyes at this age.",

    "question": "My daughter is 4 yrs old (adopted w/no Birth Family info) a year ago she had a \"episode\".\u00a0\u00a0She woke up and was very lathergic and she would fall over like a drunk her legs would not support her and ahe was not responsive just not her self. we gave her some juice and 20 min later she was fine.\u00a0\u00a0I took her to the dr and he said if it happened again to bring her in.\u00a0\u00a06 months later she had another spell in the morning same thing happened\u00a0\u00a0after a very long hard day of playing. I took her back to the DR. and he refered us to a nurologist our dr said she was probably having a sesiure (HUH!) I asked him why he thought that and he said 4 year olds don't have hypoglycemia (huh!) so, we went he said he wanted me to take her blood sugar if she had another episode.\u00a0\u00a0Sunday she had what we think was the begining of a episode I took her Blood sugar and it was 60 we gave her juice and pancakes and again she was fine in about 20 - 30 min.\u00a0\u00a0She will be 5 in March and I still can't get her potty trained at night or during naps.\u00a0\u00a0Before she takes a nap she tee-tees and then goes to bed and sleeps maybe 1 - 2 hours and 9 x's out of 10 she has wet her pull up.\u00a0\u00a0again the Dr said we need to work on potty training.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think she might be in the honeymoon phase or just hypoglycemic or having seisures?\u00a0\u00a0 OH also she has hypothyroidism she takes medicine and has since she was 9 months old.\u00a0\u00a0Also do you think I should take her to a specialist or go back to our reg dr?",
