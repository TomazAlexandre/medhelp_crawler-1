            "answer": "He did quit drinking, a few months ago. He probably received some treatment for his hepatitis. After the symptoms of leg cramps and pain, the diabetes, etc. started kicking in, he finally went to the doctor's, just in the past year. Before that, he was a firm believer in natural medicine and probably hadn't been to the doctor's in decades. Anytime he didn't feel well, he'd go to the chiropractor.",

    "question": "My brother-in-law was diagnosed with liver disease (from Hepatitis and many years of drinking) and refuses to go the doctor's despite symptoms such as a swollen abdomen, leg cramps, diabetes, and now mental confusion. My sister wants to take him to a Latin American country for the warm climate and low cost of living. It will probably take her a few months to accomplish that (has to refinance her house, find renters, pack up, etc.) I don't know his lab results, which were from about a year ago. But based on the symptoms, how long do you think he has to live? Is it really a bad decision for her to start moving to another country?",
