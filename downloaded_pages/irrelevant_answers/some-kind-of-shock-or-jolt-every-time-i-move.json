            "answer": "Hello,Cervical spondolysis or compression of the nerves can be responsible for the headaches and shock like sensations on moving the head.Just check out your posture and avoid taking a high pillow while sleeping.Regarding the numbness feeling ,it can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the numbness is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing such symptoms are transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

    "question": "I have a headache, it hurts to move...When I move, (moving anything) It feels like I'm getting shocked from the back of my head down through out my whole body. My headache feels like its pulsing. I'm constantly cold, or really hot/sweaty. I don't have a cough. My throat doesn't seem to be sore. When I sit in a weird position I feel a numbness of the limb that's in the weird position. Any sharp sounds seems to spark the shocking or jolting. It's really hard to sleep. It hurts to get up from a comfortable position. And I can't really tell but I THINK every once in a while my lips go a little numb. Please help I really don't feel good. Its only been happening for a few days (2-3) but I hate it and I have to work outside. I can't easily explain this but I did the best I could. Searching through here, people who had same symptoms(mainly the shock/jolt)\u00a0\u00a0they we're taking prescription drugs. I am not on any drugs, but I have been taking Ibuprofen to help me feel better..Which I can't tell if its doing anything.",
