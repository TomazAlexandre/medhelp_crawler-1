            "answer": "WHOA, you're working yourself into an unnecessary frenzy. Your worry is akin to someone putting an extra spread of mayo on their sandwich then getting all tipsy as if they're going to gain 10 lbs. Saying \" I don't have a monitor or anything... \" is a bad excuse that needs to stop.Here's what you can do to keep busy until your doctor's appointment.1. Buy a home glucose test meter available at Wal-Mart, Walgreens, CVS, etc. Cost is around $10 bucks. Carefully read the instructions so you understand how to correctly use the meter.2. Test preprandail [b4 meal]. This will give you a baseline measurement. You want to be between 60/70 to 99 mg/dl.3. Test postprandial [2-3 hours] after a meal. This will tell you how the foods you consumed affected your glucose levels. You want be below 121 mg/dl, optimum is below 99 mg/dl.4. . Start a food log; time, food[s] you ate, portion size, and your test results. This way you'll know which foods are good and which are not.5. Do not depend on drugs to do a job that you can do yourself, especially for weight loss. ALL drugs have nasty side effects.6. Go here http://www.atkins.com/Home.aspx read and understand how low carb nutrition plans cuts excess fat [lose weight] rapidly. Try the recipes.Plain and simple avoid foods that jack up your levels. Do not eat white foods or foods made with white flour as they are digested quickly and quickly enter your bloodstream as sugar; breads, crackers, potatoes, white rice and pasta. Always undercook whole wheat pasta. Overcooked pasta breaks down fast. Eat more vegetables, whole grains, poultry and fish. Eat lean red meats if you have to. Eat fruits with other foods as fruits contain fruit sugar [fructose]. Drink water not juice for obvious reasons. Avoid dairy milk. Read all nutrition labels carefully. I'm not saying you cannot eat these foods but be conscious of the portion sizes and what they do to your glucose levels.Most important, stop the bad habits. Make those lifestyle change before your health worsens. And, yes, just a little bit or just this one time snacking on junk/bad food does hurt.Print this out so you have it handy. Let us know how the Tues visit goes too. Good luck",

Also, put the shovel down and pick up the spoon by eating 4-5 smaller healthy meals throughout the day instead of three big ones. Go to the mall b4 it opens. Walk the aisles briskly. Great place for a workout and its temp controlled too.",
