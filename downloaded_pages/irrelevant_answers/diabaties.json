            "answer": "Hello,your numbers are higher than normal, though not so bad yet.Suggest you normalize body weight if you are overweight, exercise daily, and strictly limit / cut out sweets of all kinds.\u00a0\u00a0Starchy foods (bread, potato, rice, pasta and fruits) should be taken in limited quantities and replaced with non-starchy vegetables.Hope your doctor will also instruct you in how to manage this.You may look into getting a blood sugar meter so you can test your sugars at home.Ideal numbers are < 90 for fasting, and < 120 1 1 /2 - 2 hours after eating.",
