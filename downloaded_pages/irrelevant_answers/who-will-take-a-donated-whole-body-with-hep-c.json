            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0 Interesting question and one that I've also wondered about.You can donate your liver to someone waiting for a liver transplant even if you are Hep C positive.\u00a0\u00a0There are not enough livers available for everyonein need of a transplant and they would gladly take one with Hep C and then seek treatment.You can also donate your body to science to learn the disease process.\u00a0\u00a0I doknow an individual with HIV whom is leaving his body in hopes that future generations will learn more about the disease.We now are able to treat and cure Hep C, but will forever carry the antibodies in our blood but not be contagious.\u00a0\u00a0Would hopefully think that our remains would then have some value......Kim",

I went back to the Stanford page and read farther down to where it states --\"we are not able to accept bodies from those who have certain infectious diseases (e.g. hepatitis, tuberculosis, MRSA, VRE, Staph) or those who are HIV positive.\"This surprises me.I would think most reaching hospitals would have similar polices as Standford.",
