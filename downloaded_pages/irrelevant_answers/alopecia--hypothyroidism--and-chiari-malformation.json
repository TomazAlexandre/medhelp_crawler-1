            "answer": "Hi and welcome to the Chiari forum.Yes, many with Chiari have a auto immune thyroid condition called Hashimoto's.....this is often missed as many Drs only test TSH and they can result in \"normal\" levels...we need to have in addition to TSH , Free T3 and free T4 and TPO antibodies,An ultra sound of the thyroid is helpful too.Many thyroid issues can cause a loss of hair or alopecia.Even the surgery itself may have a temp loss of hair as this is a trauma to the body.I know that steroids should not be a long term solution as it is not good ....r the Drs\u00a0\u00a0true Chiari specialists?.",

            "answer": "There is no link between hypothyroidism and Chiari mentioned in any medical journal or medical website. All comments are ancedotal. That isn't a bad thing however, as there is over a decade of ancedotal comments of the conviction that statin drugs (cholesterol lowering drugs) caused high blood sugar and type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Last year the FDA ordered a black box warning for all statin drugs: risk of memory loss, confusion, high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes. Never say never but for now it's a maybe/maybe not.",

    "question": "Question, Has anyone linked Hypothyroidism and Alopecia (spots of hairloss) with Chiari Malformation? I have a little brother who was diagnosed with Chiari Malformation and had the surgery (decompression, and fusion of C1-C2) at 16 years old. He just recently (at 21 years old) was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism and Alopecia. The steroid shots are not helping the alopecia, and he has been put on Synthroid. I am trying to help him figure things out with the Alopecia. Doctors just keep giving him the steroid injections but after a year NOTHING has gotten better. Any information would be truly appreciated. Thanks",
