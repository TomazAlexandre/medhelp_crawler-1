            "answer": "Hi,Burning sensation on one side of the head can occur due to peripheral neuropathy which is caused by diabetes, B 12 deficiency, and thyroid dysfunction.Other possibility is neuralgias or nerve compression in the upper cervical region. Benign causes like anxiety, stress and lack of sleep also need to be ruled out. If you have a family history of migraine the possibility of migraine variant is also there.This warrants a clinical exam by your GP, please get it done.Thanks",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Was there a previous injury in the past? Neuropathic pain presents with burning, tingling or\u00a0\u00a0dysesthesia. This results from damage to or dysfunction of the peripheral or central nervous system, rather than stimulation of pain receptors. A complete neurological examination is important to rule out signs of nerve injury. If it persists, have this checked by your doctor for proper evalaution. Take care and do keep us posted.",
