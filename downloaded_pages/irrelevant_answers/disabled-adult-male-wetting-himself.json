            "answer": "Hi!Well, CP is less likely to be the cause of bed wetting in adulthood. The cause is usually stress, functionally small bladder, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, urinary bladder wall instability, UTI, stones and neurological problems. So, you need to consult a doctor to rule out hese causes. Meanwhile, pass urine before taking a nap. This way there will be much fewer accidents. Also keep the room temperature at a comfortable level. If you are cold while sleeping, this can also cause quicker formation of urine. Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "I have the same problem and mine is thought to be secondary to my mild CP.As explained to me, many doctors don't understand CP progression in adults. While it is true the lesion causing CP is static, the effects of the lesion is dynamic. For instance the lesion is the same and has not progressed; however, functionally I am worse and have way way worse spasticity. This is due to repetitive injuries incurred because having cp predisposes us to injury.The more spastic one gets the motor control they get. This can cause incontinence per my specialist. While there could be other causes for the incontinence, the cause could very well be increased spasticity. I think it is important to find a doctor that understands this concept. Sadly this isn't always easy to do as many doctors got it stuck in their minds cp is a static lesion--- and while this is true it does not mean that spasticity and symptoms are static....",
