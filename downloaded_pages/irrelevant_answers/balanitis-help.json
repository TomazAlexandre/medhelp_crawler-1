            "answer": "I heard before that getting circumcised could help with balanitis since the penis would clean. I understand that circumcision will not prevent STDS, or maybe not Balanitis. I have a really good hygiene, I shower everyday and I clean my head and foreskin everytime as well.",

            "answer": "Yes, circumcision could help with balanitis since the penis would clean and gets more air.\u00a0\u00a0So we commoned those already circumcised.\u00a0\u00a0But as an adult you should not get circumsized for this reason.\u00a0\u00a0Prevention of infections like balanitis is: You wash it.For anyone else out there thinking about the lower rates of HIV among circumsized men, and thus wanting to get cirumsized, that's not the way to prevent HIV!!!",

    "question": "I am 24 years old and I have been with only one woman in the past 5 years or so. Two years ago I noticed some redness and red spots around the head of my penis. It looked liked a rash. I was really worried about it and I went see a Doctor. I got tested for STDs and HIV. Both came negative and she told me it was something called Balanitis. The first time it happened to me. it was painful because my foreskin was swollen and it hurt when I tried to pull it back. The red spots did not hurt, nor they had any fluid inside of them. Doctor told me it has many causes such as poor hygiene, uncircumcised, and even Diabetes. She gave me somce cream to treat it and in about two days it is gone. Recently, I had the same problem, but not as severe as the first time. This time it was just red spots and some redness around my penis head. It did not hurt or anything like that. I also had a physical test te check my health. This test included STDS/HIV as well. As I was excecting my health to be, everything was fine. Stds and hiv was negative. So I don't think I have any of them and Balanitis is my problem. I have always been a really active male. Playing sports and eating healthy is part of my life. I was wondering if anybody has the same problem as me. If you do, what can I do to cure or treat Balanitis? getting circumcised could help? or What can I do to treat this problem.",
