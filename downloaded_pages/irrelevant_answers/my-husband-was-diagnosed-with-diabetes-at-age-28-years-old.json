As far as your aunts and uncle, that's probably nothing to be concerned about. But I'd find out the types they are and talk to your doctor.",

            "answer": "Type 1 is generally for younger people but you can be diagnosed with either type at almost any age. If he has type 1 it is possible she could get it. Usually they won't know if baby has it until much later after birth. I was diagnosed with type 1 in 2001 at 9. I'm now 22 and I know my daughter has a high chance to get it from genetics. If both sides of the family have it then look at which generations it's affected. Sometimes you get lucky and it'll skip her. I'm pretty sure it should skip my daughter but well have to wait and see",
