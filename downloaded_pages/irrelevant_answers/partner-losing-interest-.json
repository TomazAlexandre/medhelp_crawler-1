    "question": "Hi, myself and my partner have been together for a while now, we still have sex as often as possible but I've noticed lately that half way through he starts going soft, I'm also worried by the fact we never face each other, it's always from behind or if I'm on top I face away (he has always said he loves a rear view). I'm just worried that he's losing interest, going soft half way through, almost like he forces himself to finish, I've talked to him about it and just got \"I'm fine, if I wasn't I wouldn't ejaculate\" - Any advice?",
