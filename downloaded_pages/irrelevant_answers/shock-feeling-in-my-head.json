            "answer": "Hi there,I can't help you with your symptoms as I've never experienced it before sorry.I can only advise you to find a new doctor or ask this one what he is laughing at and then find a new doctor. I try to look at a any doctor like a plumber or an electrician, they provide us with a service that we are paying for.I don't like the attitude of some doctors these days because some seem to view their patients as below them & I just don't get that. They are no better than you or I and should not ever think they can put themselves up into a superior position.You have a history of type 1 diabetes and your doctor should not be ignoring a long standing history of this type. I am really sorry you have been having this problem for 4 years now but I honestly think you need to find yourself someone who is going to provide you with the care you need.It really gets me going when I hear stories like this...hence the ranting in my reply to your post.Take Care,Karry.",

            "answer": "Catherine, what are the shocks like? Are they painful?I was surprised to see you say they make you close your eyes. I never heard of anyone else having that until now! I am wondering if it's similar to what I had most strongly in 1999 and continuing for many, many years but less strongly (now they are rare, only when I've had some kind of sleep disruption). Mine were not painful and at first were so strong my eyes would close (I couldn't help it) and I felt like I was going to conk out for that split second. I am sure that mine were due to some problem with the brainstem/hearing system as I had recently experienced a sudden severe hearing loss and increased dizziness problem.Do they happen when you move your eyes a certain way? (Like sideways?)Do they happen more when you're sleepy, or between sleep and waking (like when you wake up in the middle of the night)?Do they come in bunches?Do they happen when you hear certain types of staticky noises?Just curious... I never got an answer for this (nor most of my other weird symptoms all these years, the most I got was a kind-of diagnosis of \"cranial neuropathy\" and later some kind of unspecified \"polyneuropathy\").I actually did have the \"shocks\" again for a short period a year or two ago, when I was playing around with migraine meds and was on Effexor for about a month... when I went OFF the Effexor I had those \"shocks\" in my head a LOT, though not so strongly as in 1999. This is apparently a common occurrence with coming off Effexor. But I was not taking ANY meds when the original, really strong ones\u00a0\u00a0(the eye-closing ones) started in 1999.Best of luck and let me know if you get any info about this.Nancy",

            "answer": "I have heard of exploding-head syndrome, and maybe this is some variant, but it's definitely not the same... I did not get a loud noise in my head, only a momentary intensification of the normal tinnitus in my hearing-loss ear.I also experienced (and still occasionally get) shocks in my face of an electric nature, around my eye, side of nose, and upper lip, but these were COMPLETELY separate from the \"eye-closing\" \"shocks,\" which I first called \"brain blinks\" because that's what it felt like, as if my brain/consciousness blinked violently off for a split second. I thought I was getting epilepsy or something!",

    "question": "I have been having shock sensations in my head for about 4 years now, I told my doctor about it and he just laughed and shook his head and said, he didnt know it could be, he never ordered any tests to done either. I have diabetes type1 and i see him all the time, and every visit he just does the same thing, shaking his head and laughs. I feel like im crazy for having this feeling. The shocks happen at any time and go away on their own. It isnt felt on one particular side of my head but mostly the frontal part, it makes me close my eyes, this is how strong it is. I have been searching and cannot find any answers, I dont know what type of doctor to consult in as I only have a general practicioner for all my issues.",
