            "answer": "Hi, I'm a 45 y/o male and 2 years ago I developed some tightness of the foreskin.It started out by having an indwelling catheter in for about a year. It seemed like I had developed Balanitis.The very first thing that my doctor suggested was circumcision. I told her that I would not even consider that. She then prescribed a steroid cream and after about 2 weeks I could see that things were clearing up. I still had difficulty retracting my foreskin even when flacid. I slowly started to stretch the skin while in a hot bath. After about 2 months things improved. Things are back to normal now.It is possible that the catheter might have been the cause, however this can also happen when there is trauma to the foreskin. Other reasons could be yeast, (diabetes). You want the diabetes ruled out as it needs to be controled if you are diagnosed with it.Yes it is possible to have things return back to normal, however it is important to find out what caused it to take place.All the best.Ron",

            "answer": "Hi Ron, I appreciate your reply and glad everything worked out for you without any surgical involvement.Today I found some white rough patches on the inside of the foreskin forming all around and mostly in areas where the small tears occurred. I will schedule the appointment with my doctor first thing tomorrow in hope to sort it out, keeping my hopes up high for not having any circumcision needed...",

            "answer": "Hi, I'm glad to hear that you are going to consult with your doctor. Let your doctor know that you want to use circumcision as a last resort. Let your doctor be conservative in treatment. If surgical intervention is needed it might be possible to just have the phimotic ring removed. Of course I sincerely hope that surgical intervention is not needed. Circumcision is used as a medical cure all, but it can cause more problems than it solves. If you look at the posts by people on this site you can see that even circumcised males can end up with simmilar problems.Circumcision damages the natural skin and removes highly sensitive nerves. It causes the glans to dry up and cause a hard layer of skin on the glans. The removed area of skin is preplaced with scarr tisue and also removes sensitivity of the glans.My younger brother was circumcised at the age of six since he was unable to retract his foreskin. After the circumcision he complained about the underwear rubbing against the glans causing pain. Later in life he was using Vasoline to treat the dried cracking skin of his glans. At the age of 18\u00a0\u00a0in 1986, he commited suicide.Please don't think that I'm trying to say that the commited suicide due to being circumcised. I just wanted to let you know that he is diseased. I often wonder what his life would be like if he was alive today. My wife and I decided that our sons stayed intact. I wonder if my brother would have made the same decision for his sons.All the best.Ron",

    "question": "I've seen a lot of discussion on topic of phimosis/tight foreskin in those who have had all their lives. But in my case it is something I have developed recently. So here is the story...I am in my mid 20's, about 2 weeks ago I noticed little patches of white dry skin on the inside of my foreskin, I didn't pay much attention at that time. Few days later I noticed difficulty in retracting the foreskin while penis was erected. It would barely go over the glans, and having never had such condition before I went ahead and retracted all the way. My foreskin slightly ripped, a surface tear, no blood. A ring/band appears near the edge of the foreskin of distinct whiter color than the foreskin itself when I try stretching, never had it before.I found great deal of information on success in stretching exercises and using steroid cream to improve the process. However, I am wondering if I have same chances of success as those who have had this condition from birth. I could always retract my foreskin fully, erected or flaccid. My frenulum would be under little pressure but only when foreskin would be pulled all the way back and then some, no pain.What I don't understand is why it would develop, and just now? When everything was fine for all my life... Is there anyone out there who had occur later in life as well?I'm really hoping to hear some positive stories, I can't do anything right without feeling all bad about this, and I can't even think about circumcision or any surgical involvement.Any help or motivation would be greatly appreciated, I really need it right now. Thank you for your time.",
