    "question": "I found some videos for accupressure for tmj and migraines and found I got some relief, particularly the tmj pts. This led me to wonder about trying this for Spirit's arthritic shoulder and the sneezing she's been suffering from if she's not in my humidified bedroom. Has anyone tried this? I'm not having any luck finding the specific direction for her that I found for myself-just a general massage you can do for overall health and mood that you do down either side of the spine while petting your cat. Any input/help appreciated. (When I get some $$ will try and find some books on this-I have some people books on the topic)",
