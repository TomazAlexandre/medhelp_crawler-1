            "answer": "Is started Vesicare for bladder issues and with it came the extreme dry mouth.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped because I couldn't even speak.The med was working wonderfully and I am going to try again.\u00a0\u00a0My neuro said that drinking a lot of water will wash the saliva out of your mouth and make the dry mouth worse.\u00a0\u00a0He said that there are over the counter remedies to help the issue and I plan on stopping at my local Walgreens and asking about them.If you feel as though it is more of a thirst issue, I would see your regular Dr. to see what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can cause that symptom.\u00a0\u00a0As for MS causing it, I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to cause just about every symptom we can possibly imagine!\u00a0\u00a0Try your regular, non-MS Dr. first.\u00a0\u00a0You seem to have some issues going on that need to be looked at.",

            "answer": "Everyone has told you what\u00a0\u00a0I would have said - I don't think it is MS symptom, but may be a byproduct of the meds your are taking.Be sure to discuss the diabetes question, because that can cause this dry mouth too.I know what everyone means by the parched, can't talk dryness that hits.\u00a0\u00a0I get that regularly from my bladder drug, but it seems to be getting better. The literature on it says that will improve with time.I could drink gallons of water too, but my neuro and my urologist have put me on a drinking plan, trying to curb the urgency and the nocturia.\u00a0\u00a0It has worked, but I am really thirsty!I keep hard candies (peppermints) and sugar free gum handy.\u00a0\u00a0One of those always helps to get my saliva flowing again.as always,Lulu",

    "question": "Hey for the past while my mouth is always like dry feeling...Not just dry tho but i always have the urge to drink water and alot of it I can drink a whole 16 oz of water in one drink cause im always just soo thirsty! And i drink about 6 of them a day. I just always have this dehydrated\u00a0\u00a0dry feeling but i know im not cause ive been drinking so much water in the past 6 months i could fill up a small pond with it all so theres no way i could really be dehydrated right?! Does MS cause dehydration? Also does eating normal food make anyone else sick? I noticed this for the past couple months I eat and get nauseted like i have to hold myself back from going to the bathroom and throwing up and try to just let myself digest it (only stay for a\u00a0\u00a0around an hour). When i eat veggies and fruits im fine tho?",
