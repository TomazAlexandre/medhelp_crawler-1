            "answer": "Hello,For such symptoms, pilonidal cyst should be ruled out. It is a cyst right over the coccyx area. In this the skin becomes reddened or even sometimes looks like a small bruise. When it is infected, it causes pain. Antibiotics or surgical drainage may be required.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am very concerned and irritated because I don't know what's going. A week ago I had a split or open sore on upper butt area(crack). It felt little irrtated and itchy and now I don't feel nothing at all. Couple days later a blister formed on the side of split. It leaked a little clear liquid for 2 days and couple regular bumps came later like two/three. Now that blister skin is gone and look like open cut/sore. It also look like two more blisters trying to form but I have no pain or irrigation now until you aggravate it. I really didn't have any problems until I took antibotics for my upper respiratory infection. I also had like a sensitive feeling on back of my right leg and moved to the bottom of my feet the next day. Please let me know what you think and what should I do?This discussion is related to Fluorouracil for lip dysplasia?.",
