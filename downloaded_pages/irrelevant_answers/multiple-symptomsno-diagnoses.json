Please have a thorough liver evaluation and be tested for viral hepatitis test for all types, a b and c. Liver issues can be very hard to diagnose and fly under the radar. Many people have hep and have o idea how they got it and have no history that would make them think they had been exposed to it and it is commo for dotors ot to test for it. Good luck, I hope you get some answers soon. All it takes are some simple blood tests, see if you ca get a utrasoud of your liver too and if something is amiss they can do a liver biopsy to determine the level of damage if any has occured.",

            "answer": "H--L, I'd be depressed to! I'm wondering what planet your docsare from. You have 2 tumors + multiple disorders. I find ithard to believe they said you're ok. Are you in US? You shouldbe seeing an Endocinologist & collecting copies of ALL labs &scans copies. You can have a (hm-health file)so do it becauseyou're going to be told stuff w/ no confirmation & later whenyou get mad enough, you won't have to gravel for them. Didn'tsay age but menapause has a elev-LH. Lo LH is from pituitarytumor location & effects mo.-cycles. You have mentioned most ofthe symptoms of 'Hypopituitarism'. 'P'can be benign but effectsHormones/lo ACTH/blurred vision/hdaches/hunger/thirst/body-temp/lo Cortisol+up-dwn/sleep/mood-swings. The steroids maybe cause of Adrenal tumor or problems from cortisol there. TheP & A glands are the cause of the skin bumps/tags. Hi-bp/chol/2 diabetes added here is serious. These glands can cause somenerve compression on Hypothalamus causing severe depression ina chemical form & not just because you're sad or upset. Thesteroid meds are changing the test results which may be wrongdose. Your insulin must stay balanced. Do you ck. BP at hm. w/a cuff monitor & what is it at? My dear, you have every rightto feel lousy & concerned. Ask docs if they think they can getsomething in balance fast. Maybe new meds? Ask if they suspectHypopituitarism & maybe that will kick their butts into gear!Don't be a wilting lily. Your body-your life & it's not veryhappy now. What is your age? What State are you in? Might helpto understand the (MDBS) they're saying.",

            "answer": "It absolutely sounds like Cushing's, and probably something else too, but I don't know what.I can't believe they haven't suggested removing your tumors!From what I've read, that usually alleviates a lot of those symptoms, unless they have a reason for not removing them.I've been progressively more ill for more than 10 years, and admittedly had to change doctors a few times due to moving and insurance issues, and the new batch of bright young minds have only just now decided to toss me to an endocrinologist after all this time, and grudgingly. Mainly because my thyroid \"looks fine\" they always assumed none of the other endocrine glands could have anything wrong with them and refused to even look into it. (even though I clearly have a laundry list of possible endocrine type problems, and probably nothing textbook)Be aggressive and proactive. Insist on an endocrine doctor.If I hadn't, I'd still be at square one and never made it this far.",
