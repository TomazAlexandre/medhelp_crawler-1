Also, call the doctor's office and ask if you should fast 8-10 hours prior.To add to allymarbles, an endocrinologist is a doctor who specializes in diabetes care and treatment. Most PCP's know only basic care - here take this pill, call me later. Good luck.",

    "question": "This has happened once 2 years ago, I would get hungry or really hungry for that matter at work and i would get shakey internally, sometimes i'd get very warm (I have panic disorder aswell so some of these symptoms could be associated with that) As soon as I eat, 10 mins or so the shaking stops. Not all the time I can get up and go eat at work. But in the past 4 months it's happened three more times. I was just wondering if this could be hypoglycemia? It doesn't happen all the time but has happened and it's starting to freak me out due to going on google and seeing hypoglycemia could lead to come or death :s Is this as serious as they made it out to be? I have a Dr. Apt on saturday. Please help?",
