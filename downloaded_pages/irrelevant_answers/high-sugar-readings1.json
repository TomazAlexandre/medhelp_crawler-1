            "answer": "Great advice above...please follow. If you live in the US, Consumer Reports gave Wal-Mart home glucose test meters [3 of them] high ratings, and they're only around $10 bucks! Read the instruction sheet accompanying the meter carefully, then prior to testing be sure to clean your test area/s. Alcohol swabs is one option. Unclean test area/s do result in abnormal readings.As mentioned in the above posted comments it does appear your food plan is causing your blood sugars to elevate w-a-y above normal. Here's the testing times:* Fasting - 1st thing in morning b4 eating or drinking any colored liquids. This will tell you if your liver is dumping excess glycogen in anticipation of your wake-up energy needed.Normal is 60/70 to 99 mg/dlPrediabetes is 100 to 125 mg/dlDiabetes is >126 mg/dl* Preprandial - B4 a meal to provide a baseline measurement.Postprandial - 2 to 3 hours after a meal. Compare against preprandial result. Avoid eating those foods or cut way back on portion sizes that jack up your blood sugars.Normal is normal fasting levelsDiabetics <141 mg/dl, better <121 mg/dlYou can use Google search to fully understand what an A1c test is and why it's used. In a nutshell the A1c is the gold standard to determine diabetes or not. Good luck -",

    "question": "I have my grandmothers glucose meter and since my sugar levels have been over 150 my dr told me to keep check on it. It has been between 160 and 170 at all different times of the day. Should I be concerned as it is that with no sugar eaten. I have been watching it. Gosh, I am craving sweets too, lol...think because I can't eat them! Do you think it warrants a call to the dr? I don't take any meds for my sugar.",
