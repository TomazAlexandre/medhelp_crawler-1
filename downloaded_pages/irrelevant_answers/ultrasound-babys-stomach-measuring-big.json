I was still I little scared because I didn't know exactly how jig he was, but when he was born he weighed 7 pounds 7 ounces . I had no issues or rips. So don't stress just go through the process and everything will work out as it should.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!!!!",

            "answer": "Usually when a unborn baby starts to measure large its due to gestational diabetes. My 1st pregnancy my babies belly was measuring at 36wks when i was barely 31wks but the head was small and everything seemed to be in preportion of the head except belly. Its definitely something they should keep a eye on and possibly check for diabetes again as it can just show up. Goodluck",
