            "answer": "Hello there, I was dx with PCOS when I was 16 y.o. I am now 23. I have always had to deal with weight issues. I am also active like you, I play basketball, and I am in the gym 4-5 a week for about an hour. My RE told me I am too \"fat\" to get prego. But I have lost about 175 in three years..and then stopped losing weight. I started to take Metformin to help with my PCOS and I have lost 20 pounds in 2 months. I know how you feel. Has your doc put you on any medication to help with PCOS symptoms? Metformin is a medication for people with type 2 diabetes. But women with PCOS are insulin resistance, and Metformin helps with the sugar levels. I would just say to keep at it, to eating healthy and keep playing hockey. There is no best kind of exercise, but at least you are doing something. Ask your doc to see if they want you to see a nutrient to help you out. Best of luck to you, and I am sorry I wasn't able to give you the best advice, but if you find it let me know.",

            "answer": "I would deffinately go on a low glycemic diet and make this permanent. Anyone who has PCOS should be only on this kind of diet. Researchers believe that women with PCOS have an underlying insulin issue.Try the diet for a while and be committed to it, otherwise it won't work. If it doesn't seem to be helping then go back to the doctor and ask to be put on metformin (insulin resistance meds.) Trying the diet for a few months gives you evidence to show your doctor that you need medication. I don't know what kind of doctor you are seeing but if he or she doesn't help you then, go and see someone else. I see an Endocrinologist for my insulin resistance. This type of doctor deals with sugar issues and hormone issues. If you need any help with the die,t just message me.",

            "answer": "I've recently been diagnosed and have been working hard at losing weight! I used to take Metformin, the cysts increased and it made my tummy hurt. I now take Actos and have been drinking Boost as a meal replacement. Drinking Boost for breakfast(5 am) and then another at 9am, light snacks in between, helped. I wouldn't eat again until 11-head back to work, turkey sandwich about an hour later(I'm a bus driver). I did that and lost about 3 lbs in 3 days. Then I got excited and ate more! Lol. Anyways, check with your doctor about your current medication, maybe you need a change Change your eating habits and continue to work out.",
