            "answer": "Sounds like good advise to me, and I'll let you know whether or not the effect continues.Homocysteine has always been a big player in diabetes, as many of you know. Under normal circumstances, Methathione is converted to Homocysteine, which than converts to Cysteine. B12 and Folic Acid, and arguably, TMG, help regulate the partnership between the Methathione and Homocysteine conversions.B6, however, is the vitamin that is normally required to convert Homocysteine into Cysteine (Generally thought to be a valued amino, as it goes onto later team to create the very important amino Taurine, even Glutathione).Sidney Baker, MD, Yale Professor, has supported the use of B6 in several scenarios, stating in his book, \"The Circadian Prescription,\" that B6 is all but required for hormonal balance. Of further interest is the fact that the majority of amino formations (The building blocks of life itself) depend on B6 for \"Proper utilization and formation.\"There are some limited dangers to taking Pyridoxine, however. In \"The Healing Nutrients Within,\" Braverman and his collegue propose that the body may have a mechanism of lowering its own B6 level in cases of cancer (A type of defense mechanism by the body, one would have to assume). Others propose that taking B6 without adequate Riboflavin may lead to a systemic imbalance. Than, of course, there is always the concern relating to toxicity of any vitamin, even the water soluables, which B6 is, of course.The RDA for Pyridoxine is something on the order of 2.5-4 mg daily, I believe, though several sources contend that taking up to 50mg daily is safe. The majority of well researched nutritional resources seem to tell us that the only danger is when a person decides to take over 100mg of B6 daily.The key area of focus here, at least in terms of the effects that I've had with the vitamin, might relate back to the concept of the general malabsorption that has long been alledged to have a role in both forms of diabetes. In addition, there have been several studies linking a genetic failure by some to properly utilize Pyridoxine, which is exactly why some companies have now marketed the actual co-enzymated version of B6.Cysteine has always been a problem for diabetics, several have alledged. With what we now know about B6's role in the conversion of Homocysteine to Cysteine, and than Cysteine's later relations with Taurine (A definitive problem area for diabetics), several key indicators would seem to lead back to \"Something going on with B6 and diabetes.\"This is yet another example, I believe, of the power of nutrition's role w/ diabetes. The key, however, as you say, is to balance the safety of any given supplementation with the advise of one's physician.Unfortunately, it appears that most doctors are leery of recommending supplementation, regardless of the continued pattern of studies being released proving the value of certain supplements and dietary needs involved with this condition.Take care, my friend.",

            "answer": "The positive effects of this product have continued for me. It's been a remarkable product all around. I've never noticed a drop like this in the amount of insulin I require over such a long standing duration.For those that might know something about nutrition, I would suggest that you do some research on AGE's. This is really at the heart of the complication game for diabetics, it appears.Furthermore, there seems to be some fascinating details surrounding this co-enzymated version of vitamin B6 and that process in particular, based on some limited studies. Who's behind these studies and/or the websites that are offering this type of advise, that's always a problem, as many of you know, so you just never know.Also known as Pyridoxamine, don't quote me on this, but it appears that there is one lab in particular that is lobbying the government to have this particular version of B6 removed from store shelves. Evidently, they have spent the past five or six years doing quite a bit of research with the product, and so it appears they feel that it is their right to lay claim to it, essentially. Don't quote me on that, but that's what it looks like if you read between the lines.Please remember that I am not a doctor or healthcare professional, and therefore you must not take my personal testimony involving this product to be that of medical advise. Never, ever begin any nutritional regime without speaking directly with your physician prior to doing so.While the safe upper intake limit of B6 is generally considered to be anywhere from 50-100mg's daily, depending upon who's opinion you take into account, it does appear that there can be some risks by taking too much B6. One author that I've read from mentions that B6 levels are generally lower among cancer patients. This may be the result of a defense mechanism, of sorts. B6 has a major role in protein digestion/absorption. Based on what is known about cancer today, that might obviously be an area of concern in many different cases.In my own case, this product has worked wonderfully, but that doesn't mean that it would have the same effect for everyone. As is the case w/ everything in medicine, what works for some might have the opposite effect for the next person, so you must never begin vitamin/supplement regimes without first discussing such options with your own doctor. He/she knows a lot more than we do about this kind of stuff, so I can't possibly stress that enough.Take care.",

    "question": "Hello to all of you once again. I wanted to share a new tidbit with some of you once again if I could. I am not aware of the rules of this community as to whether or not it is ok to post other links, so I would suggest that those that might be interested may want to do a bit of their own research on the topic if you find the time.Over the past couple of years, several nutritional/vitamin companies have made available the co-enzymated form of Vitamin B6 (P-5-P).A couple of weeks ago I started to take a 20mg sublingual supplement daily (supplying 1000% of the RDA). Never before have I noticed such an impact on my blood sugar levels in all of the years that I've tried out various supplements.Having been assigned a 14:1 carb ratio by my diabetic educator previously, I gave 2 units for supper last night for a 60g meal. That, of course, comes out to a 50% reduction at mealtime.Understand that P-5-P is not necessarily the same thing as Pyridoxine in and of itself (enzyme related), which is why I would suggest those that may have some interest in this finding read up what they can on this \"Newer version\" of B6.It appears that Vitamin B6 plays a very big role with the production and/or function of several key neurotransmitters associated w/ both forms of Diabetes, including Serotonin and Melatonin.Taking higher doses of any one vitamin or amino always poses a limited threat, so approach this with some caution. I would suggest that you take a night or two to study up on this vitamin. Good luck to all of you, hope all is well",
