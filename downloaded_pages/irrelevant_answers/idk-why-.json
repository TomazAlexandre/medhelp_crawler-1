            "answer": "Normally baby is fully developed on the 36th week. Her lungs are still developing and if the doctor feels that she is gonna be early anytime before 36 weeks he might fasten her development of her lungs with medicines so that she can be fit to breath when she is here. They say lungs are the final organ to develop and mostly they rapidly develop when the baby is on its 34th week.",

            "answer": "You should try to eat healthy food to control both esp gestational diabetes. But high blood pressure is something that requires close monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your doctor and if he thinks it's better to get your baby out analyzing the severity of your condition he might give you a steroid shot to fasten her lungs' development and will try to induce labour or arrange for an emergency or scheduled c section. Since you know your situation always be in touch with your OB. I will not recommend you to goung to a midwife.",
