            "answer": "I too am a juicy mamma to three girls and soon to be first son. I was overweight with my 2nd and 3rd but had no gest diabetes, high blood pressure and all tests always came back fine. My first I went into natural labour then the next 2 I had my waters broken...all births went fine with no complications and I did them all naturally with no drugs or gas just sheer determination!! Don't read too much into things and don't let your docs scaremonger you coz it will only make you anxious and probably from stress cause things to go a little different. You can do this cause we women were born to do it fat or skinny! Have a goal and plan in mind and stick to it and you'll be fine...I always say \"The thought becomes the deed\" so tell yourself that you are strong and going to do it your way and it will. Good luck!!!",

All my girlfriends are thin and I am just looking for some like-minded and bodied ladies to discuss things with. I have made the terrible mistake of Googling things and now I'm convinced my epidural will wear off and my doctor is going to try and pressure me into a c-section just because I'm fat, lol. If any of you ladies want to share some of your experiences that would be great \u263a I am 9wks along today.",
