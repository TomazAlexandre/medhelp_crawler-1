If you were to eat the fruit it has a much better affect. Something to do with the fiber slowing down the absorbtion of the sugars. Also I had gestattional diabetes with my last pregnancy , but not with this one....so your not doomed to get it everytime, in fact I know that this has happened to a couple of women I know. Part of the reason for the GD is the way the hormones in your placenta are reacting with your insulin. Since every pregnancy is different then so are the hormones, and placenta.

Yes you heard me right, we don't have to be sick. There are cancels and all types of disease being healed every day just by changing our lifestyle. The Lord has place a burning desire in mind and my husbands heart to provide this knowledge to as many that will receive it.The web sites are wwwhacres.com and www.modernmanna.com and also www.abundantlivinglifestylecenter.com. As you know\u00a0\u00a0the trend now is that most major fast food resturants are giving us more options for healthier foods and this is for the most part that they are afraid of being taken to court as the tobocca industry has been and has lost. So please read the testmonies of others who have made some adjustments in what they eat to ensure a healthy bodie, to become pregnant, to be healed of many diseases. The Lord is causing this knowledge to become known because He wants His people healed. Our doctors only had maybe 1 or 2 hours of nutritional teaching. I have been leaning about natural nutrition for several years and one day when I heard of a heart attack patient that just had a triple bypass being served a fatty pork chop for dinner I knew then that even the hospital dietitions were uneducated. You see I do believe that if our doctors know some of them would informs us, but the truth is most of them are just as much in the dark as we are.There is a doctor and her name is Dr. Lorraine Day and once you hear one of her videos you will also be convinced. She has several and the one entitled \"You Can't Improve On God\" is Awesome as are all the others. She will tell you how she got healed of a large cancer tumor and refused to take any treatments because she knew how toxic they were to her body.There is a book at Hallelujah Acres by Ollin IIdol \"{Pregnancy, Children, and\u00a0\u00a0the Hallelujah Diet that is Awesome and a must read for anyone wanting to become pregnant. Start educating yourselves and ask God to led you to the right information and He will as He did me in order to help you and others.Email me at: ***@**** (Virginia)Buy a juicer and juice apple and carrot juice and drink plenty of good water, eat salads, stop the cokes, caffine drinks, coffee, and with sugar and white flour products. You body is the Temple of the Holy Spirit and we should find out what makes it work the best. If you are concern about sweets read the testmonies at Hallilujah Acres how others who had diabetes got healed and what they did. Let me warn you that most people are so medical minded that they only want a quick fix by taking a pill instead of feeding their body the right nutrition. So just pray and when you know this is of God no one can take it from you. Just ask yourself this, is eating the proper diet and changing my lifestyle going to help my body of hurt it and then as begin to heal you can decide for yourself.God Bless,Virgina",
