    "question": "I have R.A. and I take a good amount of medication one of which includes medical steroids. I have been taking this steroid for several years with little complications. But last year I had sex for the first time, and the direct result was a yeast infection, since then I have had them weekly or bi-weekly since we have been together. We are married now, and I have seen several doctors about this. I was even blood tested and misdiagnosed with genital herpes, which I had re-tested and had full STD blood work done at a better facility where I see my R.A. doctor, and I tested negative. My question is what am I suppose to do or look for as to the reason I am having these recurring symptoms? My mom had recurring yeast infections as a child, which I just recently found out about, and was diagnosed two years ago with diabetes. I have had my blood checked often for my blood sugar levels, so I know that diabetes is not a factor right now. Thanks for the help in advance. This is driving me crazy!",
