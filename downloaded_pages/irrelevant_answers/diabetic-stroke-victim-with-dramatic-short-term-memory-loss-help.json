            "answer": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0my husband is blind (has been since 1980) and diabetec (since he was five - so over 50 years) and is 57 years old.\u00a0\u00a0He has been retired since 1998 (first stroke - very mild) and then had a bigger stroke in 2002.\u00a0\u00a0He lost feeling in his left side.\u00a0\u00a0He has had trouble with memory loss but since November it has gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0 I have been his \"caregiver\" since i married him.\u00a0\u00a0He used to help out more but since his last stroke has been doing less.\u00a0\u00a0I have had to learn more about how he manages his diabetes and I have had to start directing him a bit.\u00a0\u00a0 My suggestion to you and your family (his wife and children) is to get more educated on diabetes, so you can help him with blood testing and figure out how much insulin he needs to take.\u00a0\u00a0 And monitor his diet if you can ..offer suggestions. Keep junk out of the house .... and encourage him to get some hobbies.\u00a0\u00a0My husband does weight lifing with our 16 year old son.\u00a0\u00a0I go for walks with him.\u00a0\u00a0We have cats and dogs.\u00a0\u00a0He loves the cats.\u00a0\u00a0How about a book club?\u00a0\u00a0My husband listens to talking books.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I have gotten a computer for my husband and have set it up so that he can use it inspite of his disabilities i.e. blindness.\u00a0\u00a0He's got a phone list and this list includes the accounts that he likes to do stock trading in and all sort of other little details that he often forgets.\u00a0\u00a0He'll call me three times a day sometimes to get the key strokes he needs to access varous things on his computer.\u00a0\u00a0My husband was brilliant and it is hard to see this happen to a person who was so vital and amazing, so i know exactly what your family is going thru.\u00a0\u00a0Just recently my husband and I enrolled in a pottery class together.\u00a0\u00a0Its actually turning into a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "My brother had massive stroke November; he is also a diabetic; He's at home now, but with significant short term memory loss; neuro-psych says he will never work again & probably won't get any better; says he is like an Alzheimer's victim; brother lives in mid-Michigan; we're struggling with the prognosis; his wife tries hard, but is having tough time with him and being \"without\" him to help support her and the kids.\u00a0\u00a0Us brothers and sister are trying to help as much as possible, but feel inadequate, at best.We are looking for help: a support group? a blog site? people in similar situations that might be able to provide some insight and/or advice? success stories? miracle drugs/treatments? voodoo? whatever? etc?\u00a0\u00a0Help us if you can.My brother has always been very active, damn smart, and independent. It is so sad to see him like this.\u00a0\u00a0He's only 51 yrs old.The diabetes only adds to the complication. They have a difficult time managing his diabetes because he has a tough time remembering what to do, what to eat, how much to exercise and when. His motor and speech skills are ok.Please help if you can. Even commiseration is coolThanks everybody.Tom",
