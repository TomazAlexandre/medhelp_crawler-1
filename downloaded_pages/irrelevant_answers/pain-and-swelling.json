            "answer": "Since you've been diagnosed with a thyroid disorder, an endocrinologist who specializes in thryroid disorder is your best bet on treatment. Some endo's specializes in diabetes, so be sure to ask their specialty area. Most GP's don't know enough about thyroid disorders to give truly good health care.",

            "answer": "TSH 4.7 obviously is too high for you to feel your best.You should strive for a TSH of 1 and see how you feel.\u00a0\u00a0Then go from there, either direction to where you might think\u00a0\u00a0you'll feel\u00a0\u00a0your best.Your \"aching pain\", etc. is probably from the goiter. In some cases the goiter will go away on its own, with the help of meds. to bring your level lower. In other cases it gets bigger to where other treatment such as surgery is advised.If you decide to go to endo.\u00a0\u00a0make sure the endo. sees and treats many thyroid patients per year.\u00a0\u00a0Most deal in diabetes and know no more than perhaps your original MD.Good Luck!\u00a0\u00a0Hope you feel better soon.Just my personal opinion and/or experience. Always discuss your health issue with your doctor , always adhere to your doctors advise and, you always have the right to a second opinion. Nothing is a 100% or a 100%, 100% of the time.

            "answer": "Welcome to our amazing little club.Please *do* find an endocrinologist who specializes in thyroid disorders.Some thyroids can grow substernal (there are a few on this forum who have been through it) and could be causing the pain you are talking about.\u00a0\u00a0You need an ultrasound, a complete thyroid panel, and maybe a nuclear scan.Being hypo can REALLY bring on the depression symptoms - so can getting a diagnosis like you have.\u00a0\u00a0Please talk to your doctor about your depression.\u00a0\u00a0Many (probably MOST) of us on this forum for our thyroid problems are also on antidepressants.It's okay to ask for help - from your doctors and from us!!!",

    "question": "I am new to this forum and new to my disease, Hashimoto Thyroiditis. I also have a goiter, and a mass on my left lobe that they are watching. The needle biopsy was benign but they want to keep an eye on it. My latest TSH is 4.7, and although the doc says I am normal - I still don't feel well.I have been experiencing constant aching pain in my left shoulder, collar bone and sometimes up into my jaw for a few weeks now. This is the same side of my thyroid mass. It sits very low and deep around my collarbone. I am wondering if this is causing my pain, and if I need to worry.I also noticed this weekend that the right side of my neck was much larger than the left. I don't know whether to be worried.Right now I am seeing only my family doc to treat this.\u00a0\u00a0They sent me to a ear,nose & throat speacialist to look at the mass, but should I be seeing an endo instead?I don't know what to do. All I know is that I feel awful. I am on thyroid meds, 2 bp meds and now on something for stress/depression.",
