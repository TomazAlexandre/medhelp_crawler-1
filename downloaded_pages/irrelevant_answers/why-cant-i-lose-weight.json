            "answer": "The doctor is correct a common side effect of insulin is weight gain but that is easily overcome by proper nutrition and exercise. This is something that has been discussed a number of times on this forum. Try reading other threads to gain an insight on what foods to eat, what foods to avoid, and why certain foods wreak havoc not only on your glucose levels but your ability to lose weight.One note: You will see 30 minutes of daily exercise being recommended. Do 20 minutes of light resistance training first. For the first 20 minutes you\u2019re burning of glycogen [stored glucose mainly in the liver and muscles]. Once you break the 20 minute plateau your body begins to burn fat.",

            "answer": "Buy a few books: Eat to Live by Joel Fuhrman, MD, You: An owners Manual and You: On a Diet, By Michael Roizen, MD and Mehmet Oz, MD, Southbeach Diet By Arthur Agaston, MD. Adele Puhn has written some great books like Sugar Busters, also good. Read these books and learn about how the body reacts to food and diabetes. I'm sure there are other great books out there but make sure the ones you read are by top notch research physicians, not diet zealots. Create a combination of eating from these terrific books which you can maintain. With the new knowledge you will gain you will be a better working partner with your physician and reduce your sugars faster and possibly for ever. Walk each day, a mile in the morning and a mile in the evening. Start with less if you must but move at least 15-20 min twice a day. Clear this with your doctor first---I have no way of knowing your beginning weight or other conditions. Make sure you have supportive athletic shoes and soft socks so you do not get any blisters. Protect yourself. There is no need to be hungry all the time, but a little hunger is good. So many of us are raised to feel we should never be hungry. Please educate yourself on high nutritional value, low carbohydrate foods that satisfy but don't raise blood sugar. These foods also give the body what it needs to heal. Your doctor will help you with sugar levels, medication and monitoring your overall health but he or she can't be there when it's 11:30 pm and pizza beckons. That you must do for yourself and you CAN! If...you have the knowledge and awareness that this is not a choice. Type 2 diabetes is a life threatening condition. I have it too. It was impossible for me to diet. Then a terrific friend reminded me that my food choices were no longer aesthetic...I was no longer choosing to lose weight to be trim an fit into a size 8. I now had to accept I had a serious medical condition and avoid sugars and simple carbs. to save my life. It is no longer a choice for me and I do not debate, I simply choose to eat according to my plan. I have lost some weight, my sugars are in normal range and I sleep and feel better. I am the worst food addict ever. You can do this and no one else can do it for you. Choose to live!!!",
