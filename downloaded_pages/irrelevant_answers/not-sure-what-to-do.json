Just looking at them would bug me and that could stretch your skin and cause abrasions. You're not even done with the pregnancy yet! I would ask my doctor over and over again! lol That can't be comfortable..and you don't want to damage anything in your feet or legs. When was the last time you talked to or showed your doctor?",

            "answer": "Be very careful and tell your doctor fast, you may have what is common during late in pregnancy as pre eclampsia. It may raise your blood pressure and if that's the case this is bad for you and your baby and they will deliver you early to relieve you of these symtoms. If you dont have that then the doctor will tell you to keep your feet elevated. Good luck and post when you find out.",

The blue spots are probably vericose veins, I'm very familar with that and they look like brusies and can get worse like mine but I doubt you will have this problem for long since your so close to giving birth. Tell the doctor everything you told us because you might just wind up with a baby this week!",

It can cause death in both the mother and baby, as having preeclampsia can even cause strokes in the mother.If she was bad off they may keep her over night to get things steadied. If her blood sugar has been out of whack as well, they could be trying to stabilize that as well.at 35 weeks, if the preeclampsia is bad enough, they sometimes induce labor as its the only way to get rid of it.",

I learned alot on the TLC and the Discovery channel by watching Special Deliveries and A baby story and it's about not only regular births but also situations just like that our friend. I learned alot about things I was going through with all my pregnancys. I've been watching it for about 8 years. It is very informative and it helps you ask your doctors straight forward questions about these pregnancy issues.
