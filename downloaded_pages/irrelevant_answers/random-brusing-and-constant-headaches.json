            "answer": "I don't know if I can offer much help, but I have had a similar experience. I have always had severe migraines on a daily basis, but the weird thing for me was that they went away. I was getting weird bruises and spots on my hands and arms that would go away after a few hours, but the tiredness thing is the exact same. Ever since this happened to me (a few weeks ago) I've had a constant shaky feeling throughout my body.Like I said, not much help, but I am able to relate.Hope you get it figured out!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I think you have deep vein thrombosis of the deep veins of the leg or maybe valvular dysfunction of the deep veins of the legs. This can be diagnosed by color Doppler or by angiogram of the leg veins or by duplex ultrasound.High blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out. All these can cause headaches too. Birth control pill (in females) is another cause of bruising. At times adrenal gland insufficiency results in bruising and chronic fatigue syndrome and this possibility should also be explored. It could also be due to pressure urticaria.\u00a0\u00a0Possibility of the bruise being rashes due to contact dermatitis too should be explored. Do discuss with your doctor and get yourself investigated. Take care!",
