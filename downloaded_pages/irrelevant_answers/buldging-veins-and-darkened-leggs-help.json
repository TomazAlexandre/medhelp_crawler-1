            "answer": "i dont know for sure what it might be but i knew an older man who had an open wound on his leg and flies laid eggs in the wound and he had the same issues with darkening and swelling\u00a0\u00a0but since it is in both legs im not sure if that is the case unless he has had open wounds in both legs,try soaking them in hot or very warm water to see if the swelling goes down at all and if it does then the fly issue is surely not the case.I hope it helps.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The symptoms could be due to deep vein thrombosis of the deep veins of the leg or maybe valvular dysfunction of the deep veins of the legs. This can be diagnosed by color Doppler or by angiogram of the leg veins or by duplex ultrasound.High blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your vascular and medicine specialist for this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
