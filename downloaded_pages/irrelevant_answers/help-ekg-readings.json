            "answer": "It sounds like a pretty normal EKG.\u00a0\u00a0EKGs are not very sensitive at picking up left atrial size.I would focus more on risk factor reduction -- treat any underlying hypertension, diabetes, don't smoke, exercise and watch your diet.\u00a0\u00a0These are things that you can control and are productive places to focus your energy.\u00a0\u00a0Your EKG sounds relatively normal would not typically generate a cardiology consult -- grant it, it easier to see the EKG and interpret it than to read the numbers.\u00a0\u00a0 EKG machine interpretations are often wrong any way.I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for posting.",
