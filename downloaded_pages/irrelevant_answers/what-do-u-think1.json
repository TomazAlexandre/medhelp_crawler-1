            "answer": "The flashing lights that you experience will be part of the migraine.\u00a0\u00a0But at the same time it would be a good idea to see an ophthalmologist to make sure there is no problem with your eyes.Have you had any blood tests to find out if you have a bacterial infection that is causing the ulcers on your legs and in your mouth?Keep a record of what you eat and drink so that you can identify any trigger foods that set off your migraines.\u00a0\u00a0Chocolate, coffee, oranges, red wine and cheese are usually the main food culprits.\u00a0\u00a0You may have different triggers.Staring at flashing lights on a TV and also being at a computer screen for a long time can also cause migraines.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you limit your time at a computer screen and have a break from the screen every half hour or so.Sores and ulcers in the mouth can be caused by being anaemic and a deficiency of the Vitamin B complex, specially B12.\u00a0\u00a0If you have not had your blood test for that, it may be worth having it done.\u00a0\u00a0Also get checked for Vitamin D deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0It may also be a good idea to get a swab taken from your mouth to find out if there is a bacterial or fungal infection that may be causing these sores and ulcers.\u00a0\u00a0Also ensure that you have good oral hygiene.\u00a0\u00a0Bonjela which can be purchased without a prescription helps to soothe sores in the mouth.For your sinus problem, if there is an infection, the doctor would prescribe an antibiotic and or a nasal spray.\u00a0\u00a0At home to help with sinus problems, do steam inhalations 4 times a day for a duration of 10 minutes each time.Pour very hot water into a bowl and put in some Vick or Olbas oil, bend your head over the bowl covering your head and the bowl with a towel and breathe in the steam.\u00a0\u00a0Take care not to get scalded.\u00a0\u00a0The steam inhalation helps to loosen up any congestion and unblock any respiratory tubes.For the arthritis, you doctor should take a blood test if you have not already had that done to find out which type of arthritis you have.\u00a0\u00a0There are specific medications for Gout and Rheumatoid Arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0For Osteoarthritis, a physiotherapist would be able to give you information on the right type of exercises to do, take rest breaks and pace your day.\u00a0\u00a0The right type of movement is important otherwise you will cease up.\u00a0\u00a0An anti-inflammatory is sometimes used (some people are allergic to that and it can cause oedema and stomach problems) and also pain relief medications.Sometimes an antidepressant like Amitriptyline is used to help to relax the muscles and nerves that cause referred pain.Have any of the doctors you been to ever checked your heart and kidneys?\u00a0\u00a0Swelling in the legs and especially the feet can sometimes be from heart or kidney problems.\u00a0\u00a0A blood test for kidney function would indicate if there is a kidney problem or not.Your heart palpitations may be due to being anxious, but it is also a good idea to see your doctor to get your heart checked out.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "I have been examined by a neurologist?\u00a0\u00a0This is a person that specialises in neuropathic pain and will be able to say if you do have nerve damage.Neuropathic pain can happen due nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0This can happen as a result of injury, inflammation and spinal problems when the nerves are being aggravated by for example a slipped disc, bone spurs pressing on nerves, from uncontrolled high sugar levels and sometimes due to lack of some vitamins and minerals.\u00a0\u00a0The vitamin that sometimes is lacking in the body that can present with neurological nerve pain is the Vitamin B group.Did the doctor have your blood test checked for Vitamin B12 deficiency?Although you may not have diabetes, you may be glucose intolerant or have prediabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 As the blood tests are coming back negative for diabetes, a glucose test will identify if you have a glucose intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0You can still get nerve damage from this.If you body is lacking in minerals and vitamins due to malabsorption or a poor diet this can deplete of your body of all the necessary minerals, vitamins and other nutrients to keep your body functioning correctly.As you lost 60lbs in a very short space of time and suffer from ibs, a blood test for specific minerals and vitamins would confirm whether you are lacking these.I presume you have been checked to rule out anaemia?\u00a0\u00a0Lack of iron can not only make you feel tired, lose your appetite, but can also cause a sore tongue.Losing the feeling in your back is likely to be from problems with your spine.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had this investigated by xrays or MRI scans?As you are concerned about your high sex drive, had you had a blood test to check your hormone levels?\u00a0\u00a0People's sex drive does vary; some people have a high sex drive, other have a low one.\u00a0\u00a0Sex drive can be dependent on lots of external and emotional issues.Did you get a swab taken from your ulcers to identify the bacteria that is causing this?",

            "answer": "Thank u ur advice has been helpful my neuropathy doesn't hurt there is a spot on the bottom of my foot that i feel is like walking on cotton. Its also hard to use that muscle i am predicted and have major back problems. I have several disc out and some degeneration. But recently the pain level has drop a lot so idk if that's good or my spine is worse off. Haven't had any xray or anything in 4 years. I have had the vitamins and mineral test there all good. No one has tested the mouth blisters. And no one can figure out my high inflammation. Sed rate is at least 80 for two years. Still don't know why. And i have been on celebrex for three years. Well hopefully good news soon. I will talk to my back Dr about change in pain.",

            "answer": "I do hope you figured out that my last message should have read \"Have you been examined by a neurologist?\u00a0\u00a0I know I have been :) but it was a question I was putting to you.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry.\u00a0\u00a0My brain doesn't\u00a0\u00a0always pick up things that are in front of my eyes.If your foot feels like you are walking on cotton, there is an issue somewhere that is causing this.\u00a0\u00a0When my feet were swollen and I felt sensations like that it turned out I had a kidney stone.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, because I did not have \"text book symptoms\" (one doctor told me many years afterwards) when I first went to the doctor I was treated for depression.Your foot problem may be something that is to do with the foot or your shoes, or \"referred pain\" from your back problem.When you say you have mouth blisters I am wondering if these are canker sores.\u00a0\u00a0Bonjela that you can purchase from the superstore or pharmacy can be applied to the sore which allows for it not to get aggravated further by the teeth and helps the sore to heal quicker.\u00a0\u00a0The reason I asked whether you have had a swab is because you have been getting them a lot.It is not a good idea to be exposed to xrays too often unless it is absolutely necessary.\u00a0\u00a0But if one of your joints is much worse, the doctor may want a new xray taken to confirm their suspicion that the joint has deteriorated further.As you are still have high inflammation (I presume this is by blood test), I have seen on TV (America's Monsters Inside Me) and read about it too, that worms or parasitic infestations can cause the high inflammation.An autoimmune disorder like Rheumatoid Arthritis and Lupus would show high inflammation results from a blood test.Good idea to discuss with your doctor how you are and about your medications and if an alternative one may help you better than the one you are on.Do let me know how you get on.Hope you get on OK.Best wishes",
