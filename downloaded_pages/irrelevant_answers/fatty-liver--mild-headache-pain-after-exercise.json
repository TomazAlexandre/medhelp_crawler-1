            "answer": "A fatty liver will tend to make the liver larger and swollen to a degree. This causes compressive stress on the bile canaliculli within the liver lobules and this will lead to a mild level of cholestasis, as indicated by the mildly elevated bilirubin.But it seems that you are having success in resolving your fatty liver issue since both your LFTs and bilirubin levels are now normal. So keep up the good work!As far as the pain and headache are concerned, these are not liver related. So you might want to see your doctor about it if it persists. Take care.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately, we are not doctors here, just very experienced people who are doing battle with disease or helping friends that are. So again I would recommend seeing a doctor if the headache and pain remains a problem. If you are being very active with your exercise (a good thing!), then maybe you are becoming a bit dehydrated and this may lead you to the headache/pain, etc. Just make sure you get enough water if you are exercising vigorously, and things may settle down for you.",
