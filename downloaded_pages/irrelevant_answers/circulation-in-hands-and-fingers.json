            "answer": "Yes, they are. Small blood vessels are the ones quickly affected by high blood sugar levels, and so circulation in both hands AND feet can be affected. People are more likely to notice injuries to hands than to feet since you see your hands all day. You may want to have your doctor take a look at your hand.Small blood vessels in the eyes, kidneys, and heart are also at risk, which is one of the reasons that diabetic people are told to get annual fully dilated eye exams and have kidney function checked. I hope your purplish finger is a temporary thing and that it turns out to be nothing, but I would suggest that you mention it to your doctor even if the color normalizes in a couple of days. It may be a symptom that he should know about so he can make sure that he does appropriate tests in order to keep you healthy.",
