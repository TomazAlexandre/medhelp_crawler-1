HCV, type 2 and treatment have a lot of interplay.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, your hcv could be a contributing factor to blood sugar 'abnormalities'.\u00a0\u00a0See an experienced hepatologist and check in with an endocrinologist and maybe even get them on the same page.\u00a0\u00a0You can successfully treat hcv and deal with type 2.\u00a0\u00a0It's a balancing act and may require some lifestyle changes.\u00a0\u00a0It's doable and beats the alternative.",

Happened to me with a lab service so now I only have my viral load specimens pulled at a hospital lab.",

It worked out nice with the drs working together and I am now SVR 2 and half years!",
