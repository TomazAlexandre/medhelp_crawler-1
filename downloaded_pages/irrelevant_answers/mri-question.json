They aren't out this evening. There are so many new folks on the forum, and it seems some are slipping through the cracks and feeling let down. So I seem to be this evening's welcome wagon!If I'm not mistaken, 35 years of epilepsy may be able to cause some of the findings you describe, but I will leave that to our medical folks when they return.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there - help will be along, hopefully soon. Your appt is just around the corner!Penn",

Anything I seemed to find kept leading back to MS. I don't know much about it at all....I just know that my MRI findings brought me here. Can anyone help with my MRI at all?",

So here are my findings: There are several tiny punctate foci of abnormal signal predominately located within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally but are also noted within the deeper centrum semiovale and periventricular white matter. These are more prominent in the frontal lobes. I do not have nor have I ever had a migraine. I have had Epilepsy for 35 years. I appreciate any lamens terms I can get. I feel so lost. I see my new Dr on the 7th of November. Thank you so much!",
