            "answer": "This isn't the doctor forum but I can answer some of your questions.1) miscarriages happen in a third of all pregnancies. I have had one as have many people on this online community and I was able to get pregnant and carry to term the next time. Having a miscarriage doesn't mean that there is anything wrong with your wife and they start doing genetic testing to see if something is wrong if she has had 3 or more in a row. 60% of miscarriages are from chromosomal defects due to maternal or paternal factors. 15% are caused by maternal trauma, infections, diabetes mellitus, dietary deficiencies, hypothyroidism or uterine abnormalities e.g.. fibroids; cervical incompetence. In 25% of cases, the cause in unknown. I have heard of people being severely anemic and still going on to carry to term.2) While she is bleeding you will probably want to refrain from sex but as long as the doctor gave you no medical reason for not trying right away it should be okay to start trying when you both feel up to it.3) If she is RH + she shouldn't have any problems concieving. There is only a problem if she is RH - and you are RH + then she would need to get shots every once in a while to combat it.4) You can start when you both feel mentally and physically able to unless the doctor advised against it.I hope this helps some. I'm sorry that your wife is having to go through this and I wish the best for both of you in her next pregnancy.",

However,our physician advised for an ultrasound-pelvis on her 11th week and it was found that there was no physical and heart activity of the fetus. the report stated that the approx. gestational age as 6 weeks+/- 5 days. It is pertinenet to mention here that during her 7th week she had mild cramps in her lower abdomen and our Doctor suggested Microgest 200 to be taken through her passage.Eventually she is now evacuated. My questions are:-1) Why this happened. I mean what could be the probable reasons?
