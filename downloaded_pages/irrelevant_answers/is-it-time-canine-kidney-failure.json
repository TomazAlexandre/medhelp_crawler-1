            "answer": "Very sorry for the condition of your dog Cyrus. My English setter was recently diagnosed at only 7 years of age. I can empathize with your pain because of the tragedy of this happening at such a young age. For me, it is especially difficult not knowing what may have caused this. I don't think it was genetic. I wish you and your dog the best.Robert",

    "question": "So my friend Cyrus (5y/o German Shepherd) was diagnosed with kidney failure this past January. I had blood work done because of his over drinking and urination, because I was thinking diabetes. The vet called and said no diabetes, but he is in kidney failure. His BUN came back 59 (normal being 7-27) and Creatinine 3.1 (normal being .5-1.8). Urine specific gravity was 1.014. I had his urine tested again in April because he seemed to be having accidents (something he NEVER did). and his urine specific gravity went to 1.007, also showed he was positive for Urine Occult Blood. Now, the past few days, he has been having accidents in his crate. He also isn't eating much(other than today, he seemed to want his food more than his water). Yesterday, he ate maybe half his bowl of food, which he threw up in about 15 minutes. He has had watery stool for the past 2 days (and has gone at least 6 times today, which isn't normal for him). As he was eating/drinking today, while standing, I noticed watery blood dripping from his \"boy parts\". He still tries to play with his toys, but doesn't seem to be lasting as long as he used to. About a month ago, he had bloody diarrhea. The vet then told us, it was time to start considering having him put to sleep. I didn't feel he was ready then, but now it seems this is all starting to take a toll on him. He's even slow walking up steps now. I do not want to wait until of his sense of pride is completely gone. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!",
