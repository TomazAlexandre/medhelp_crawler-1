            "answer": "Hi,There are many reasons for your feeling weak, some of which may not be related to diabetes at all. If you feel unwell it is always best to be evaluated by medical professionals just to be sure. If you have a glucose meter, start checking on your own to se if blood sugars are an issue right now. Otherwise I think you should seek some medical assistance.Take care.",
