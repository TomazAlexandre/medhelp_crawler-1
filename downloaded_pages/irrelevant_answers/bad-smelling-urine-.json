            "answer": "The following applies, if you are female; UTI usually goes along with urinary frequency (having to go urinate all the time), urgency (feeling like you have to urinate even though you just went), and Dysuria (pain or burning with urination). If you have these symptoms, you should obtain a urine culture to check for UTI. STD s are sometimes associated with a foul smelling vaginal discharge, itching, pimples or pain, or rarely burning in the vagina. Usually urine odor is related to things that you eat, and sometimes medicine that you take, not to STD. Sometimes you can have an STD in the urinary tract, but this is also associated with a discharge from the urethra..",

    "question": "I had sex a few days ago with my boyfriend and now my urine smells really foul. He has diabetes, but we had sex many times before and I never smelled it. Its so embarrassing I don't want to use the bathroom at other peoples homes because of the scent. I also had salmon the other day and I wasn't sure if that could've of caused the scent. I've never had a scent before after eating salmon, but I just want to be sure. Could I have a possible std?",
