            "answer": "Hello,From your symptoms it looks like tinea versicolor. Tinea versicolor is caused by a fungus that lives in the skin of almost all adults. Factors that can cause the fungus to become more visible include high humidity and immune or hormone abnormalities. Treatment involves topical and oral antifungal medicines.Also apply topical antifungals like Lamisil or Monistat. Severe cases may need oral antifungals for which I suggest you to consult a dermatologist as they are not without side effects.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello there,I have gone to the dermatologist in the past for this issue, I don't remember what it was called, but basically I have a fungal infection with symptoms that involve small red dots on my chest that spread in the hot weather. They are not painful or itchy, they are just there, and quite embarrassing. I was prescribed \"Seleb\" shampoo and I used it for awhile and it went away but whenever I stopped using it, it came back. I then found out that any sort of dandruff shampoo has the same results.How do I get rid of this once and for all? I assume I would have to go back to the dermatologist but i'd like some insight first",
