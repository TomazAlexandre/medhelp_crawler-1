            "answer": "I am Type ll diabetic taking metformin & Januvia. My levels are climbing and the Dr. is considering insulin for me. I do not want to be insulin dependent. Trying to lower with diet changes but have other health issues that restrict what I can eat. I have high cholesterol (can't take any statin drugs to lower), diverticulosis,irritable bowel, fibromyalgia and now a mouth full of braces so am unable to eat many things because my teeth do not hit together to chew. I am going crazy trying to figure all this out. I have used Boost, mashed potato, low fat cottage cheese & yogurt, oatmeal with flaxseed - what can I do to lower my glucose readings, loose weight but be able to chew it??",

    "question": "I'm a type II diabetic diagnosed this year with food allergies: corn, peanuts, soybeans, eggs and lettuce and various things in those families.\u00a0\u00a0That puts a great many \"health\" and low fat foods off my list and diabetic staples like eggs are a fond memory.\u00a0\u00a0I can't find any information out there to help me balance these evils (diabetes and allergies) against each other. When I was eating the foods I'm allergic too I had debilitating diarhea and a continuous runny nose and chest conjestion.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad to have those gone.\u00a0\u00a0I guess the question is which will kill me first: diabetes or food allergies. Any resources out there for diabetes with food allergies?",
