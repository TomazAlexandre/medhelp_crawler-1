A cluster of symptoms, originally considered a subtype of ADHD-I, but presently is not listed as mental disorder.No known cause, nor any specific treatment is available.Please, read my earlier response to SScalio.Many of these symptoms may vanish, should the possible faults\u00a0\u00a0in thediagnosis and consequently the treatment be corrected.SScalio, please message me. You may be able to improve substantially.The current approach - drugs for your symptom relief is not only inappropriate to my opinion, but potentially dangerous!I can explain all this in detail.Love & LightNiko",

    "question": "Hello, I am wondering if anybody has a suggestion of medications that work to help with memory problems associated with SCT that will not cause more memory problems or possible brain damage with long term use? The reason that I have a fear of more memory damage or brain damage from certain meds is that while searching for medications to help with memory I have come across information that certain medications like aderall and others can actually cause memory damage with long term use, plus I already have memory problems due to SCT, long term uncontrolled diabetes, major depression which is being treated with citalopram, hypothyroidism and long term untreated ADD or what I believe is SCT because I fit those symptoms to a T.I really need something to help because I am planning on going to college for bioengineering and I want to be able to successfully store and retrieve\u00a0\u00a0the information\u00a0\u00a0that I learn instead of forgetting the information after some time of not constantly using the information. My doctor has prescribed to me provigil to relieve the feeling of constantly feeling tired and sleepy, but I am not sure it will help with memory retention and memory retrieval, so I was looking to also add something else to stabilize my memory. Please help I am desperate? I have tried ritalin, but I felt like a Zombie and I lost track of time to easy while on that, it also didn't help my memory retention or recall at all.",
