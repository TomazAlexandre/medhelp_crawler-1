    "question": "I am having some scaling and cracking between my toes, with itching and redness. I am a 40 y/o woman who does not visit the gym, locker room, or public saunas/pools. My husband and step son do not have symptoms. Where did I get this from? Could I have picked it up at the hospital when I had surgery in April or from a doctor's office? I have run barefoot at those places.Thanks",
