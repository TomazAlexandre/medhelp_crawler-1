            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you suffer from is probably narcolepsy, which is a neurological disorder. This is thought to be caused by low protein called hypocretin, which is made in the brain. The symptoms are an urge to sleep especially after meals. Sleep studies and EEG are done to rule out other causes of poor sleep and insomnia. Eating light and frequent meals during the day helps. Also assigning a nap time during the day often helps. You can take a light meal before this. At times some ante depressants are prescribed to control the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Do consult your doctor and get a referral for a sleep specialist and a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0Other possibilities are pancreatic insulinomas causing a surge of insulin production after meals, hypoglycemia and an urge to sleep. In women it can also be due to PCOD.Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "Doctornee is correct, but my vote is simple: Abnormal glucose levels.If you are overweight, this increases the liklihood.There are several inexpensive tests available, but you need at least what is called an hba1c.They will then, if the results suggest a problem, probably prescribe Metforman, which will help you to lose weight.If your physician did in fact refuse a diabetes evaluation, you should consider changing physicians.",
