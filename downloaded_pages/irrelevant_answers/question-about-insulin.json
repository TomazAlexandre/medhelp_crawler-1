            "answer": "Hello,Insulin resistance often is seen in women who have PCOS, so your lab tests are not too surprising. Did they also check a glucose level with that insulin level? The reason I ask is that higher insulin levels will be automatically seen with higher glucose levels many times just physiologically, but also you should have it checked to ensure you do not have early glucose handing problems which can also happen in PCOS.Given the risks for development of diabetes in future based on insulin resistance and PCOS, you should discuss treatment options with your doctor. A good start is some lifestyle interventions including increased exercise and diet changes to induce some weight loss if you are overweight. This has been shown to help improve PCOS and decrease future chances of diabetes.Take care.",

            "answer": "I did do a glucose level and it was 96. I am awaiting results of a fasting glucose test. I am slightly over weight (anywhere from 175-185 and i'm 5'9\") but have been unable to lose anykind of significant weight, no matter which diet or exercise I try.\u00a0\u00a0I lived by the zone diet for a while and it did little to help. Exercise is difficult because my body usually crashes for about 2 days immediately following any trips to the gym.",

            "answer": "Hi,Even a small amount of weight loss can be helpful so don't give up! Any diet that you can stick to(and there are MANY) is worth a shot. To keep it simple, you can simply plan on reducing your daily calorie intake by between 100-200 calories per day.Exercise regimens have that effect where your body hurts a few days afterwards, but you need to push through, gently.Be sure to start out slow and not overwhelm yourself, perhaps just walking 15 minutes a day, then work up to 25 etc over another week's time. Take it slow and steady. If you have an injury ofcourse, then take a break and recover. If you experience any shortness of breath or chest pain(or other concerns) see you doctor about it before continuing the exercise regimen.Good luck,",
