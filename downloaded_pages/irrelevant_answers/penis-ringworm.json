            "answer": "Hi!Yeast infection or thrush is at times very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks along with local application of antifungal cream. There are many types of antifungals available. Take an OTC antifungal with a combination of two or more anti fungals. Use both oral and local application. rovided it is indeed fungus, then only try this. Antifungal tablets are strong medicines and should not be taken otherwise. So start with cream and if it helps, start the tablet.Many treatment options are there like Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1%, ketoconazole, terfibnafine and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%. Many OTC products containing these salts are available, your pharmacist can help. Try a combination of two and apply until the round marks you see disappear. Continue application for 2 weeks after the marks disappear. The cause for persistence is that the treatment is often left in between. After the itch and dryness goes, you have to continue applying for at least another 2 weeks for the infection to be completely cured from the lower most layer of the skin. Wash your hands well and dry them properly both before and after the application. Meanwhile test for blood sugar level to see if it is high for diabetes too can prevent resolution of fungal infection. Take any anti-allergic tablet or antihistamine to overcome itching if you have.Take care!",

    "question": "I have had this weird semi-whitish spot on the head of my penis for weeks now. So I did some research and I think it might be a penis ringworm. Its not an STD because I'm a virgin. I dont' play sports but I exercise in the gym 3 days a week. And at one time I had to pee all the time but it stopped about 2 and a half weeks ago. So I tried lotirmin ultra with 1% butenafine hydrochloride for a week and a half but I didn't notice any change. So now I have limasil with 1% Terbinafine. My questions are is this the right cream for treating a penis ringworm and how long will it take until the ringworm is completely gone? Thank you for your help.",
