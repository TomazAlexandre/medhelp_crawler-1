    "question": "I am constantly getting headaches (a few times a week). I believe the headaches are due to not eating on a regular schedule. If I don\u2019t constantly eat something my head will hurt sometimes it gets to the point where my head hurts so bad that I get nauseous and throw up (about once a month).I am a student and when I\u2019m in school I eat on a VERY regular schedule because meals are served at a certain time. However, now it is summer and I work I can\u2019t eat at those same times.Is there any thing I can do to prevent this? Is this a sign of diabetes? Should I see a doctor?",
