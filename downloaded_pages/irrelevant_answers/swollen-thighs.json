    "question": "I am almost 37 weeks pregnant, have mild gestational diabetes that is well controlled with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Last night, I noticed bilateral swelling of my thighs.\u00a0\u00a0I was on my feet all day; they feel slightly numb to the touch and definitely bloated.\u00a0\u00a0My feet and ankles, as well as the rest of my body, are normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have elevated my legs for several hours without much relief.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained almost 20 pounds this pregnancy and was slightly underweight, but healthy, prior to pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0 The baby and I have been healthy, other than the diabetes, for the entire pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0My husband is on a business trip and my doctor's office is closed until Monday.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a large enough concern to go to the ER?\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be so appreciated.",
