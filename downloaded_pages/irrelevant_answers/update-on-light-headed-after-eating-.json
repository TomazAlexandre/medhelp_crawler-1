            "answer": "Thanks for updating us. Follow up post can be done within the original post. That way everything stays in the same place and new readers can follow what is being said.You should ask the doctor for a copy of the lab results. This is patients rights and they should be free of charge. They're very easy to follow; lab test on the left, the test ranges (low to high), and the test result. Those that have low results will be indicated with an \"L\" next to the score, and an \"H\" for high. I like to keep an eye out for any that are boderline and work to bring it back to mid-range.This is a good site to reference medical tests and health topics.http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/encyclopedia.html",

It has continued ever since.It's just about a constant now, since I eat meals throughout the day and the feeling lasts for at least several hours afterward.",

            "answer": "tgreen - Have you heard of Reactive Hypoglycemia, also called postprandial hypoglycemia? It occurs in people who do not have diabetes. It's a different type of hypoglycemia than the one that affects people who have type 1 diabetes. I'll quote Wiki, \"It is thought to represent a consequence of excessive insulin release triggered by the carbohydrate meal but continuing past the digestion and disposal of the glucose derived from the meal.\"",

            "answer": "WaveRider,I was in fact, just diagnosed with this. It is a hard pill to swallow, because I have altered my diet and still feel the effects. There is no sure fire way to avoid feeling like a space cadet every day. The diet helps only a little. I almost want my problem to be something else, because there seems to be no way to completely beat this.FML",

    "question": "This is for my wife. She is 38 y/o. She over the last few months has started to feel light headed or foggy after EVERY meal. No matter how much or how little she eats. And its EVERY meal. It starts about 15 to 20 min after she eats. We have tried to change what she eats and nothing changes. We try to cut out differant things yet it still happens. Its so bad that it is hurting her at work because after lunch she gets fogy and can not focus on what she is trying to do. As an accountant this is her busy time of year she works 12 hours 5 days a week and 8 on Saterday. Does anyone have any idea. She has gone to see the Doctor and had blood taken.Well he got back to us. Her Vitamin D was a little low and her White Blood count was up a little. He thinks it was due to a cold. So she is going back next week for more tests. We need to find out what the blood tests that he did were and what other ones we can do. This is frustrating.........",
