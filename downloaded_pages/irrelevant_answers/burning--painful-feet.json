            "answer": "Hi, your blood sugar is not terribly high with that A1c.\u00a0\u00a0or do you have highs and lows?\u00a0\u00a0Some people, unfortunately, develop neuropathy with only slightly high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0So it is possible that this could be from diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 However, some people develop neuropathy without diabetes.Given your symptoms, I would want to try to further reduce blood sugars as close to normal as possible and as stable as possible.Low carb eating may help on this, exercise, weight management etc..Another possibility is that metformin can deplete b vitamins in your body.\u00a0\u00a0Lack of B vitamins can cause neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I think you should go to your dr with these symptoms and ask to have your b vitamin levels tested.\u00a0\u00a0You should then supplement with b vitamins too.Please let us know how you go.",
