            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!With a history of bouts of diarrhea, nausea and back pain there is a chance that you are suffering from Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. These can cause tenderness and pain. Depending on your symptoms and a few tests these will have to be ruled out by a gastroenterologist. Pancreatic or colonic cancer too is a possibility. A gastroenterologist can also help you with this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiNow that you mention blood clots, high blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out. A color dopplar or an angiogram is able to diagnose the clots and deep vein thrombosis. Lipid profile, liver function tests, pancreatic enzymes, blood sugar, platelet count, kidney function tests are a few things you should check for.Hope this helps.

    "question": "I have mid back pain on the left side coming and going for years. It will hit me and I feel like I cant function its so bad. Then when its not flared up I am fine. I always KNOW the pain is there as it is somewhat tender inside now. Also had a spot come up on my ankle that looked like blood pooled under skin after umerious trips to the ER thinking I had blood clots they said maybe superficial blood clot. I read that that can go along with pancreatic cancer. had abdominal ultrasound a year ago that was fine. blood work has been fine. any ideas?",
