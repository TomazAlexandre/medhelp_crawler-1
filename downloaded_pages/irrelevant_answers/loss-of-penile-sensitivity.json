While loss of\u00a0\u00a0penile sensitivity may be attributed with age, it can also be due to a variety of issues such as illness that reduces or restricts blood circulation, neuropathies, medication side effect and even smoking or drinking. It is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper management. Treatment\u00a0\u00a0will depend on the underlying cause. Take care and best regards.",

            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. While some loss of sensation may be expected with age, other possible causes that could lead to penile insensitivity could occur due to trauma, GU infections, inflammations, systemic/ metabolic issues such as diabetes, hypertension, alcohol, smoking, radiation therapy etc. Also psychological issues such as stress/ anxiety may act as a contributory factor. At a primary level I would suggest being relaxed and working on the blood sugar/ pressure levels and alcohol/ smoking, if involved. If these do not seem to help, you may consider an evaluation by a urologist. After a specific cause is diagnosed, a management plan can be drafted out accordingly.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
