    "question": "Does anyone else have severe dizzy spells. Im 17 weeks and 2 days and since about 14 weeks ive had some odd dizzy spells. Its almost like my blood pressure bottoms outs. My vision gets blurred and my head feels like its going to explode. Sounds are muffled like its coming through water. I get short of breath. It usually happens when im standing. Not all the time though sometimes when im setting. Makes me worry if maybe its my sugar or blood pressure or if its going to hurt the baby. Anyone else experience this?",
