            "answer": "I have been experiencing the same exact symptoms regarding pain in the upper left quadrant but have yet to be diagnosed. I also have feelings of faint, dizziness, fatigue and the \"shakes\" as I call them if I don't eat regular meals. I will be seeing a dr. this week to locate the reason for the pain and will keep you posted. See my post under undiagnosed symptoms 4/21/06",

            "answer": "I am not a doctor just a volunteer with Type I diabetes. I did some research about calcification, because it is not something I had heard of before and it lead me to Chronic pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe this is something to discuss with your doctor.The fatigue I can relate to because I had my Thyroid removed and getting my synthroid dose correct took some time and I did have fatigue when it wasn't at a correct level.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps having your thyroid checked with a thyroid-stimulating hormone blood test could see if that is the problem.The diabetes symptoms could be checked with a blood test as well.If you don't feel like you are getting all the information you need seeking a second opinion seems like a good plan.\u00a0\u00a0When you go to your doctor do you make sure to mention all of the things you notice about your body?\u00a0\u00a0I try to write down everything so I don't forget.\u00a0\u00a0It usually helps.\u00a0\u00a0An endocronologist is a doctor who specializes in the endocrine system, maybe you need to seek out a specialist as well.",

    "question": "I have been plagued with severe, upper left abdominal pain for a while now.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 35 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0I've had an upper G.I. which was fine.\u00a0\u00a0I've had two CT scans, both of which confirmed the presence of a single, coarse calcification located in the tail of my pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0Along with this regular upper left abdominal pain, I've had issues with undigested food, extreme fatigue, but no weight loss. (I believe this is due to the fact that I've been inactive...thus, an actual gain in weight).\u00a0\u00a0I've had symptoms that remind me of those that my father experiences with his diabetes...if I don't eat small, regular meals I become very faint, weakness, fatigue, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I am just curious as to whether or not anyone has had experience with such a presence in the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor does not seem to think it's anything to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if I should seek a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you kindly for any help.",
