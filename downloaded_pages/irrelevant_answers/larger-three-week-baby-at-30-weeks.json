            "answer": "I have diabetes. And both of my boys measured a few weeks bigger when it came to the end of my PG. When I was 39 wks they were measuring 43 wks. SO it is normal for having GD. But be cautious and REALLY try to control your blood sugar. Cause if the baby shows too big, you will most likely have to have a C section and they may have to take it early.Good luck.~Candi",
