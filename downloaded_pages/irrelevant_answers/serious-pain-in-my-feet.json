The majority of reported events occurred upon initial exposure. In some cases, symptoms recurred with rechallenge, suggesting a causal relationship. In rare cases, allergic reactions including anaphylaxis, recurred within days after initial anti-allergic treatment was discontinued. If a serious allergic reaction occurs, appropriate therapy should be administered, with close patient follow-up over several days. Neulasta\u00ae should be permanently discontinued in patients with serious allergic reactions.I would bet it was the Neulasta\u00a0\u00a0that also gave you a reaction if you were already sensitized\u00a0\u00a0by a reaction to the chemo.Decadron side effectsIncreased appetiteIrritabilityDifficulty sleeping (insomnia)Swelling in your ankles and feet (fluid retention)HeartburnMuscle weaknessImpaired wound healingIncreased blood sugar levels. Persons with Diabetes may need to have blood sugar levels monitored more closely and possible adjustments to diabetes medications.Might want to get tested for any metobolic\u00a0\u00a0problems.",

            "answer": "Hi....I was wondering if your feet change color at all??? Like changing from white to blue or bright red? Do they get really cold? Sometimes because of steroids and other things you take.which are vasoconstrictors...it can cause your small blood vessels to constrict. This can cause coldness and numbness and then when the circulation returns it can cause a lot of pain in your feet or even fingers. If this sounds like something you have then you might look into Raynauds. No pain medications really help it only keeping them warm and maintaining good circulation. Victoria",

            "answer": "This is a link for Raynauds...under the causes of secondary Raynauds you will see chemotherapy listed as a cause. It will also describe it better so that you are better able to determine if this is a possibility.http://www.apsfa.org/raynauds.htmI have this because of autoimmune problems, but I have met some people who have it because of chemotherapy. That is what made me think of it. Hope this helps....and if not it then maybe someone can give you more answers. Good luck.",
