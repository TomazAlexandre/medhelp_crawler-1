            "answer": "Hi , sounds like you have probs with your blood sugars falling a little low.\u00a0\u00a0Try to carry some protein snacks with you like cheese and crackers, yoghurt, nuts and seeds and try to eat some protein at least every couple of hours - this should really help.If not, go see your Dr and ask for a glucose tolerance test so they can see if you have high blood sugar (pre-diabetes) or low.\u00a0\u00a0Cheers :-)",

            "answer": "I have this exact problem! Ive been told that my blood tests are normal and dont show diebetes, but I was diagnosed as \"hypoglycemic\". Its not good to not eat for several hours, you will feel horrible. My daily food intake consists of eating every 3-4hrs but never going longer than that, or I will get the headache with the shakes, and sweats, and so on. I eat a small portion of food every 3 to 4 hrs to be exact and its kept me feeling great. Im new on here and happy to help :)",

    "question": "So I find that when I don't eat for a few hours I start getting a headache, which is then followed by becoming lightheaded, getting shaky, and feeling like I'm going to pass out. I've gotten my blood sugar checked before and it always comes up normal. Does anyone know what else could be causing this?",
