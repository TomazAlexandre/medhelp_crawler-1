            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Your symptoms could be due to UTI, or urinary tract infection. The infection could be at any level from bladder to ureter to kidney. It could also be due to a stone in the urinary tract. It could also be prostatitis or a prostate related issue. You need to get your urine examined for infection.However increased frequency of urine is also seen in diabetis mellitus and diabetes insipidus. DM has been ruled out. DI should be looked into.Since the burning sensation is also felt in the feet, it could be a nerve issue or even a vascular issue.Another possibility is overactive bladder. The clue to right treatment is right diagnosis of the urgency. Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor (PCP) and get a referral for an urologist. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I appreciate the response.\u00a0\u00a0As I said in my original post, diabetes and infections were ruled out on blood and urine tests.It looks like my next option is to have a test done where they stick a scope up inside me.\u00a0\u00a0Doesn't sound pleasant at all.\u00a0\u00a0The distubring thing is most of the time, I still feel sensations of discomfort in my genitals even after urinating.\u00a0\u00a0It's like the urge never truly goes away and this is causing me great stress.\u00a0\u00a0Oddly, one thing that seems to make me feel briefly normal again is masturbation.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!Yes, agreed that diabetes mellitus and UTI have been ruled out. You still need to rule out diabetes insipidus and overactive bladder. Another possibility is irritable bladder\u00a0\u00a0syndrome or detrusor muscle instability. Sleep apnea, interstitial cystitis, and hyperparathyroidism too should be looked into. The other thing is to restrict your fluid intake post 6 pm in the evening.You must talk to your physician regarding all these possibilities and maybe you would need to consult an urologist too. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
