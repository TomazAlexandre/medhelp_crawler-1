            "answer": "Ghilly has offered some good suggestions. I would also wonder about kidney diseaes, given the loss of weight and thirst. This could be discounted with blood tests at the vets. I assume they checked blood results for kidney failure?In the short term, it seems it is important to get something nutritional in him. Personally, I would advise something like Green Tripe, which you can usually get in tinned or frozen form from a good pet store. If bought frozen, cook a 2 inch square chunk in the microwave at 30 per cent power for 10 minutes. It must be GREEN tripe, not white tripe used for human consumption. Dogs invariably love it, even though the smell is a bit offputting for humans. It also contains lots of nutrients and minerals, while being fairly gentle on the digestive system. I've never known a dog yet to turn its nose up at green tripe, so give it a try if you can (mix with a little cooked white rice). Tony",

    "question": "7 year old dog has been losing weight for the last few months and is now skin and bones. He has been through numerous tests, had food changes, IV shots, antibiotics for urinary infection (cleared up). We even changed vets and just before christmas we were told we would have to make a decision with him if no progress. He had the infection and was sick, vomiting when he had the infection but hasnt been since the infection cleared. The thing with him is that he stopped wanting his food so we have had to give him what we prepare for him like hamburger and rice, chicken, etc because of him losing so much weight. But he acts like he still hungry. He will eat treats and drinks lots of water. He isnt crying or whining like he is in pain but looks like he is starving\u00a0\u00a0to death. The vet said that any other tests would be to invasive and suggested it may be cancer but noone has any definitive answer to what is wrong. My question is, how do i know if he is in pain. He will get up and run with my other dog every now and then. But looks like he is dying. I dont know what to do,",
