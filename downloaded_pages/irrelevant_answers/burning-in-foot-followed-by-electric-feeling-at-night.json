It can be made better or to be gone completely if the foot is elevated or/and in a different position, such as tucked underneath with the foot pointing behind, if people know what I mean. I have no sensation in my left foot due to surgical reasons when I was young.",

    "question": "I have spina bifida and am confined to a wheelchair. I have hydrocephalus, chiari malformation and was diagnosed with cord tethering last week.I have had this burning sensation in my right foot for several months. It can be followed up by this sensation of electric volts going through it at night while lying down. It causes my foot to jerk because of the sensation. The burning in the day can be quite persistent. I went to my local doctor's about the electric feeling and he said it's nothing but a trapped nerve and said not to worry.Anybody know what this could be?",
