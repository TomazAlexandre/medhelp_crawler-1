            "answer": "At the close TSH range you are at in the very high end of normal I think you may be experiencing thyroid (A-symptomatic) symptoms - but other issues could be going on.Your adrenals - which control the thyroid hormones in your system could be depleted and that is why your labs are so close to normal.To eliminate Adrenal Fatigue you need a cortisol blood or better yet 24 hr saliva test. Also a ACTH test (which is blood work too)\u00a0\u00a0You may need to get on Vit C - magnesium and cortisol to correct this - but labs need to be done.If your adrenals are weakening - this would cause your many symptoms you are having.",

    "question": "I've been having symptoms of hypothyroidism, but I'm not sure what is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I just had blood work done, and have a feeling evreything is goingt o come back normal (as usual) and I will get a pat on the head and sent away.\u00a0\u00a0Let me get this straight, I DON'T want anything to be wrong with me, but I have very real symptoms that I don't understand.Symptoms: extreme fatigue (I feel like I can't make it through the day) - its not like just being tired, its weakness.\u00a0\u00a0I also have experienced lack of concentration, dizziness, floaties in my eyes, swelling of my feet and ankles, lots of abdominal bloating and pain, and of course, weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0I gained 5-7 lbs in two weeks, then lost it all in 2 days (edema).\u00a0\u00a0 A lot of the time, I can't exercise to my full potential and get tired and really dizzy and \"lower\" heart rates.\u00a0\u00a0I also feel like I can't get enough air in my lungs when I work out (but I have asthma, so I've always attributed it to that).\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I feel like my heart is racing, but I'm not sure it is.\u00a0\u00a0My pulse always seems to be normal when its taken.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure is always normal.I have a history of psoriasis.\u00a0\u00a0I am recovering from a guttate outbreak from August.\u00a0\u00a0I have some joint pain, but i haven't been formally diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0The edema is really what freaked me out - that just started.\u00a0\u00a0My feet got a little swollen and hurt a bit, but I tried to pass it off as sitting a lot, possibly psoriatic arthritis, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Well, when I gained the 5-7 lbs and my ankle bones went missing, I got a little scared.\u00a0\u00a0I have considered congestive heart failure too, but I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 27 years old.\u00a0\u00a0 I guess i\"m just asking for some opinions.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
