            "answer": "Thank you Sandee, you are so correct. This also applies to muscle relaxants or any medications that effect the ability of our bodies to feel pain.Some years ago I was offered a pain solution by permanently killing my femoral nerve (major nerve in your leg). Like you Sande I thought about the long term consequences of that procedure. Basically I would have a dead leg thus producing the inability for me to feel pain. If one would ever develop diabetes it is imperative that you do not injure your lower extremities or that if you do that the injury gets immediate attention. How would one ever know if there leg was \"dead.\"This is great knowledge for all of us. I know I \"over do\" when my pain medications are working well and I know better. A mistake for sure.Tuck",

            "answer": "I take my cleaning to extremes when my meds are working because the times I am hurting I tend to let things ride and then when I am having a day where my medications do help like they are intended I over do it and let me tell you the next day is so bad I am usless. It is a never ending merry go round. I have to work and take care of my family wether or not my pain is in control or not, just as we all do our lives and responsibilities do not stop because we are hurting.I have to be careful and do what I can as far as cleaning and hire help so I do not make myself invalid for the days following. There was a time I would never let things go around my house I would push myself but I have had to learn to limit myself to the things I can do and hire someone to do the rest. Its funny the things we would never have dreamed of doing before the pain we find ourselves doing now:)",

            "answer": "I'm afraid of that as well, of taking too many ibuproferen and then twisting any part of my body the wrong way when they're at full throttle in my system. Actually I have already done that, but to lesser degrees. Because of my cerebral palsy, I tend to have spasms and contractures quite often throughout the day and can easily do more harm than normal people can to themselves. It has kept me awake on more than a few occassions because I have come quite close a few times.",

    "question": "This issue has come up a couple times in the past few days.Do you as a chronic pain suffer know you have to be careful about futher injuries while taking pain medications?When we take our medications for pain we are essentially numbing our pain signals too. When you experience pain it is there to let you know something is wrong and to stop what your doing to avoid futher injury.I had been looking forward to having some nerves burned as a pain management solution until I thought about the risk invovled. When there is no pain signal to alert me that I need to take it easy then what will stop me from hurting myself worse.Pain medications are mostly required to help us function but the down side is it does numb other pains as well. The pain that we get when we are over doing it is important.As a CP pt do you know these facts and what do you do to help avoid futher injuries?(Please disreguard any errors as I am still working from my mobile)",
