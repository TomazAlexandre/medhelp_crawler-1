            "answer": "My endo told me that Tg readings are pretty useless except as a cancer marker.\u00a0\u00a0Meaning those, like me, who have had TTs (total thyroidectomy) because of thyroid cancer need to have our Tg levels monitored.\u00a0\u00a0If we experience a rise in Tg levels we need to consider RAI (radioactive iodine) treatment to kill any remaning thyroid cells/cancer.\u00a0\u00a0My rising Tg levels three years after my TT and an increase in my TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) were an indicator that my cancer had returned.My endo explained that Tg levels can be all over the charts for people with complete (or parital) thyroid glands so the test isn't really relevant for them.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to confirm thyroid cancer (in my opinion) is on a pathology report following thyroid removal.\u00a0\u00a0Some people are \"lucky\" and get positive results on a biopsy (fine needle or open biopsy) but I know many, many who had cancer and had negative biopsy results.Don't panic about the Tg.GravesLady is wise - find a good endo who specializes in *thyroids* - most deal only (or mostly) with diabetes.",

    "question": "Hi,My wife has done a blood test, ultra sound and biopsyUltra sound findings3 nodules found, 1.0 by 3.0 cms, 1.7 by 3.1 cms in the right lobe and 1.0 by 1.5 cms in the left side of the neckBlood testThe blood test results all are normal including Anti-Thyroglobulin Ab 22 U/mlBut the Thryoglobulin is very high, it is 183.0 ug/L.BiopsyNo findings of malignant cell in the Biopsy result. The findings are consistent with cystic degereration. For the left thryoid upper:There is insufficient materials for a reliable cytological diagnosis, A repeat aspirate is recommended.My Questions:Is this a cancer? (If not what makes the Thryglobulin very high.Is the endocrinologist the right specialist for this?Thanks and Regards,Rishi",
