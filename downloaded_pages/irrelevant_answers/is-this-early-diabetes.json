            "answer": "Yes!\u00a0\u00a0There are several reasons blood sugar can drop even if you don't have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Tumors of the pancreas or adrenal glands can cause this.\u00a0\u00a0Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (lack of digestive enzymes) can cause this.\u00a0\u00a0Certain nondiabetic specific medications(eg certain antibiotics) can cause this.\u00a0\u00a0Malnutrition can cause this.\u00a0\u00a0Picky eaters can suffer from this.\u00a0\u00a0These are just some of the reasons you can have low blood sugar.My youngest son has the same problem your grandson does.\u00a0\u00a0I am Type 1 (age 14 diagnosis).\u00a0\u00a0My oldest son was diagnosed with Type 1 at age 9.\u00a0\u00a0When my oldest son was diagnosed, my youngest son then 5 years old took it upon himself to also pee on the Ketosticks.\u00a0\u00a0We were shocked to see large ketones.\u00a0\u00a0However, his sugars were normal, so we didn't worry too much.\u00a0\u00a0As time passed, we would do periodic ketone and sugar checks.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes he had ketones and slightly elevated sugars and sometimes not.\u00a0\u00a0His A1C was always normal.\u00a0\u00a0He developed hypothyroidism when he was 9 years old.\u00a0\u00a0When he was around 13 years old he began having issues with low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed he would randomly have severe low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0We started to checked his sugars 2 hours after meals, but they were always good.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep in mind that even nondiabetics can have sugars over 200 if they eat food (especially sweets) then test their blood sugar 30 minutes after they eat.\u00a0\u00a0Also, kids have different target ranges than adults.\u00a0\u00a0So then we did the glucose tolerance test.\u00a0\u00a0The results were inconclusive.\u00a0\u00a0His blood sugar ran a bit higher than what was considered normal for the first half of the test, but by the end of the test his sugars were back in normal range.\u00a0\u00a0His pediatrician was ready to diagnose him, but I wasn't convinced.\u00a0\u00a0Neither was my endocrinologist who was following his case as well.We decided to look at other possible causes, and after lots of blood tests and imaging to look for tumors and such, we decided to just change how he ate.\u00a0\u00a0He was at the top of the growth chart in height but at the bottom of the growth chart for weight.\u00a0\u00a0We switched him to eating several times a day instead of what he was doing - almost no breakfast, light lunch, a few snacks after school and dinner when I forced him to come downstairs.\u00a0\u00a0As long as he ate something about every 3-4 hours he avoided the severe lows.\u00a0\u00a0Mom and Dad breathed a sigh of relief.\u00a0\u00a0He is 20 years old now and still fights low blood sugar when he goes too long without eating.\u00a0\u00a0What he doesn't have is a diabetic diagnosis.My advice would be to not stress too much over this especially if your grandson is a picky eater.\u00a0\u00a0See what the pediatrician thinks about letting your grandson be a grazer, and consult a pediatric nutritionist.\u00a0\u00a0Be proactive about preventing low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of concentrating all his calories at meal time, spread the calories out over the whole day.\u00a0\u00a0Always have a baggie of his favorite snack at hand for him to munch away on and a juice box to chase those scary lows away!\u00a0\u00a0I hope all goes well with his future testing.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to your family.",

    "question": "My son is a Type 1 diabetic, diagnosed at 15.\u00a0\u00a0He has a 2 1/2 y/o son that they had trouble waking one morning.\u00a0\u00a0My son grabbed his tester.\u00a0\u00a0My grandsons blood sugar was 42.\u00a0\u00a0They went to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0 Lots of tests were taken, all came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0The endocrinologist they followed up with said his case was not the norm and was odd.\u00a0\u00a0 (His A1c was 5.0)\u00a0\u00a0They were told to keep a log of his blood sugars for a couple of months.\u00a0\u00a0Over that time, he has had maybe 3 lows, but, a number of counts over 100 (a few over 200).\u00a0\u00a0He is now awaiting a continuous blood glucose monitor to wear for a few days.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway............the endocrinologist says he's not ready to diagnose him diabetic \"yet\", but, feels he is starting on that path.\u00a0\u00a0(There are no autoimmune anti bodies present.........leading him to believe he'd be idiopathic Type 1B)\u00a0\u00a0 My question is.......is there anything other than diabetes that could cause these symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering if there is something not common they may be overlooking.",
