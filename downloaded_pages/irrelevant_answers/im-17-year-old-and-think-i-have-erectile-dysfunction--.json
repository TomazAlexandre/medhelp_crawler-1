The most common psychological problems can generally be related to: inhibited sexual desire, anxiety disorders, depression, mental fatigue, stress, guilt etc.Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure,negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord injury, nerve damage (for example, from prostate surgery), or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease).Get evaluated for all these causes from a doctor.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "for about the past 1-2 years I would masturbait on a 1-3 day basis. And never have I had a problem with holding an erection. But recently the past couple days (where I have been masterbaiting everyday for the past couple weeks) it seems hard to get an erection porn doesn't seem to turn me on neither. I was reading something about testicular atrophy but my testicals don't hurt or seem to have any physical differences. I'm laying off master baiting starting now. Any suggestions?",
