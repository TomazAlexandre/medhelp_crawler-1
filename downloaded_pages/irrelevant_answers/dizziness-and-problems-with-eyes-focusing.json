    "question": "Hello, I was injured in April 2006, before this time I never had a back or work injury at all , and very seldom have health problems other than colds like once year. I was moving an IV cart that was fully loaded in the ER. As i held the handle with my left hand, and the cart to my left side , all the drawers slid out and the cart tipped yanking me hard to the left and whipping my head to the right. The day of injury i had burning and some pain through my neck and back, and dizziness like my equilibrium was off. The 2nd day pain and numbness down my left arm and left leg. Eventually they found out I have a bulged disc at c-6,c-7 with central canal stenosis and a pinched nerve,now also starting to have bone growths above the disc. I still have pain and numbness now in both legs,left arm,and through my whole back.The dizziness at first would come and go with head positions(not spinning dizzy but sea leg dizzy).In October 2006 I was doing light duty filing, put my head up to look at the top shelf(about 6-7' high)I instantly got dizzy and my eyes would not focus properly. Like a digital camera everytime I move my eyes, they are slow in focusing. It hasn't gone away.So I am out of work due to this, I can't drive, walking too long , anything where I have to focus my eyes in a distance. I have excellent vision with a slight astigmatism for close up things like reading. Never have I had a problem with distance vision. I have been tested for diabetes,lime disease, ms, cartoid artery, blood pressure,vertigo,hearing,all negative I had Mri's of c-spine, brain(perfect), and lumbar with mild bulging at all disc which they say is normal............ My ENT says he believes it to be disequilibrium caused by the bulged disc, the physical therapist for vestibular and balance disorders thinks it has to do with my vor ,and the neurosurgeon says my problems should be more right sided(although it is left sided in my back leg and arm,and right sided in my leg, back, and once in awhile in my fingers and head and earlobe),and wants to hold off on surgery and continue more aggressive therapy,and has no clue what the dizziness and focusing problem might be..Everythings only gotten worse with physical therapy 3 times a week,2 steroid injections,anti-imflammatories,steroid packs and more. All with no improvement with pain except for a couple hours .And the dizziness and focusing problem is now all the time.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 What I would like to ask is what you think it might be.\u00a0\u00a0I JUST WANT TO GET BETTER, and need some honest opinions.So I can get better.This is really affecting my life.I would also like to ask if you know of any doctors in New Hampshire who might treat symptoms like this.Any help or opinions you can give would be greatly appreciated............Thank you................Michelle",
