            "answer": "Hi,with an A1c of 8, your average blood sugar is about 200.\u00a0\u00a0That is high considering that average blood sugar of non-diabetic is 100 or lower.With blood sugars this high, you could be peeing out sugar and this could cause you to lose weight.What meds are you on?\u00a0\u00a0Would be better to see if you could get your blood sugars a bit better.Low grade infection, can also make blood sugar control worse - the fever could indicate a low grade infection - which is I guess what the dr is looking for with the CBC.",

    "question": "Sorry this is so long. I'm 26.A couple weeks ago I woke up with a massive headache that didn't want to go away and I hurt Everywhere too but mainly down the back of my thighs and legs. I could roll over in bed but it hurt way too much to get out of it.I've also had a low grade fever (99.0, I usually run 97.0) for a month now that doesn't want to go away and my head hurts a lot :(And didn't think anything of it but I went from 272# to 236# in 2013 and 236# to 224# in 2014. I was 224# on Jan. 2nd and am 221# as of this past wed. I need to lose weight but am not trying and pretty much eat what I want since I'm still learning how to cook. PB&J isn't helping as far as eating well goes, but my weight keeps dropping like crazy.And I don't eat a lot either. My past doc. wanted me eating 3 times a day to keep my sugars regulated but some days all I'm hungry for is 2 granola bar.\u00a0\u00a0Or like yesterday all I ate was a piece of cake and 4 small meatballs. It's been like that for at least 1.5 years. They can't make me eat 3 times a day when I'm not hungry.So far this winter, I was sick the first week of Nov. and then for 2 weeks starting the day after Christmas. That is a lot better than last year.My new doc. I saw wed. is running a CBC. I don't know of all my past blood tests but on the ones I do know of, my white blood cell count is high, so are the absolute lymphs and some other things.Could my diabetes be making me lose all this weight even when my sugars are for the most part good-A1c nov. 2014 was an 8.0.",
