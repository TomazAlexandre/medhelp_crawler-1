            "answer": "Some of us have a chemical imbalance, that is why we become addicted. I too take Cymbalta and I love it. If you had diabetes wouldn't you take insulin? Well if you have a chemical imbalance then you need medicine to fix it. It does not mean that there is anything wrong w/ you. I am not even saying that you do but maybe you should talk w/ a professional to see if something might help!",

            "answer": "I went into depression around 45 days after withdrawing from opiates which resulted from guilt. I took anti depressants and I thank God for that! I was suffering from chronic insomnia during that period of time (wasnt able to sleep for more than 48 hours straight). So the meds really helped put me to sleep and made me feel less depressed. I am past 4 months now and I feel great! So you should consider talking to a professional.",

    "question": "Many of us know when we come clean from Opiates, or any other drug for that matter, depression can be a severe side effect.I was wondering what each of you did to fight this, and how severe and long did it last?I am 5 months clean and feel more depressed than ever. Not suicidal, but \"blue\" and unmotivated, and not give a **** about anything.I want to avoid taking anti-depressants if possible, but will go down that road if things don't get better.I am currently sidelined at work do to past injuries just not healing, and am trying to stay busy with small projects. But things are just tough right now. Like I said, I just don't seem to care about much.",
