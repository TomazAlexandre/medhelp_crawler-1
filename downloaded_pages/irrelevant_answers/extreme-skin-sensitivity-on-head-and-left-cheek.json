            "answer": "Don't panic, but you should request very strongly that your doctor test for diabetes and/or cancer.\u00a0\u00a0My husband began having a similar skin sensitivity issue on his head, face and back, general malaise and fatigue, muscle fatigue and ache, gradual increase in shortness of breath, frequent light nausea and diahhrea.\u00a0\u00a0 He was eventually diagnosed with diabetes - a simple blood test.\u00a0\u00a0Getting his blood sugar under control reduced the fatigue and ache, and some of the nausea.\u00a0\u00a0Since it did not fully relieve his symptoms we kept going back to the Dr.\u00a0\u00a0Seeing a neurologist, rheumatologist, and a couple other \"ologists\".\u00a0\u00a0Finally, a chance CAT scan showed a small mass in a lung.\u00a0\u00a0Cancer was diagnosed, and unfortunately it was terminal.\u00a0\u00a0NOT ALL CANCER IS TERMINAL.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps your symptoms have NOTHING to do with cancer.\u00a0\u00a0But I urge you to find out.\u00a0\u00a0If my husband had been tested when his symptoms started he would have had time for treatment.\u00a0\u00a0At the best - it's stress.\u00a0\u00a0At the worst - well, better to find out while there's still time to do something about it.\u00a0\u00a0Don't wait.\u00a0\u00a0And don't let your doctor bully you into believing it's nothing.",
