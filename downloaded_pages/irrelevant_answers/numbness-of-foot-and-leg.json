Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency,nerve compression or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated.

            "answer": "Having your blood sugar level tested is meaningless. Thyroid involvement is possible, but as unlikely as you being abducted by aliens.You require either a complete fasting glucose test or an insulin clamp protocol.Numbness of the feet is a hallmark of what is called diabetic neuropathy.Usually, but not always,\u00a0\u00a0these findings go along with a fruity smell to the urine caused by ketone bodies.Taking vitamin B-12 is also meaningless advice, as well as \"taking B-12 for some days\", unless the B-12 is administered by injection or sublingually with folic acid. It will take several months for the B-12 to have an effect. You can have B-12 levels measured. The problem is not that we don't get anough B-12, but that it is not easily absorbed. The receptor sites are under the tongue and near the lower bowel.You need to go for a complete diabetic screen and work-up by an M.D.At early stages diabetic neuropathy is reversible. If if continues untreated you may end up with losing your feet a slice at a time.",
