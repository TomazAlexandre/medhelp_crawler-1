            "answer": "His weight is just below the 5th percentile and his height is just above the 75th percentile for his age. He is slightly underweight for his age. Suggest he has a blood glucose tolerance test which indicates if a person has diabetes or not. In the meantime, suggest increasing his protein intake and he has a protein source (meat and/or dairy) with meals and snacks so he is not eating carbs alone. For his age he need 2000 calories a day. Hoped this helped you.",

            "answer": "My son had the OGTT and his was 100g he took it at 9:33 am and by 10:05 his sugar was 390 30 min later I had to take him back in he was breathing bad and was trying to vomit his sugar was 400 then at 1.5 it went to 381 then at almost 2hrs it hit 436 and at 3hrs was down to 220. This test scared the skin off me. My son didn't even look coherent. The doctor said he gave him 100g not the 75 g he wanted to but that either way his numbers are super high and he thinks yes he is Type 1.. THEN he comes back and said wait he sending us to a gastro doctor because it can actually be something like delay in the tummy emptying which my son had the poops 5x in 2 hrs because of this test.. I really doubt this. Then he said maybe it is because he has a nison fundalication or his sugar is high because he has dumping syndrome. Either way I was not happy I said I want to talk to a endocrinologist he said ok and he talk to one and they said to run these blood test on my son Islet Cell Antibody a GAD65 Antibody and a C-Peptide which we have already done so waiting on the results. My mind is so lost on this doctor am not sure if i should get second opinion or what. I made a mistake his A1c was a 5.5 but his sugars at home are still on high side. Friday we had pizza and it went up to 185 hr after he ate and then was 141 at 2 hrs. Not sure what to think and I have to wait for a referall to see the Endo or the gastro that can be weeks :(",
