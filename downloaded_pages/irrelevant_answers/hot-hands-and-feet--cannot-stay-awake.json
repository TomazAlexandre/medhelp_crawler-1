    "question": "I have no idea what is going on, my symptoms seem bizarre to other people, this always seems to happen after eating, but I have recently been tested for food allergies and they said I have none, I do have an allergy to mold & dust mites but I do not think that is related to my symptoms. This is what happens, my hands and feet become uncomfortably hot inside & out, if I take my temperture on my forhead it will be normal 97. or 98. but my palms will be 100. or higher, they also turn red, my nose itches, I usually get a headache and I can not stay awake, I usually fall asleep pretty quickly & will sleep very heavy for an hour or so and when I wake I feel as though I am drugged, very heavy, groggy and tired. Does anyone have any idea what is going on? I have had these symptoms for at least 15 years and just lately they have been getting worse. Thanks for any suggestions.",
