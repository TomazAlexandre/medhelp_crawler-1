            "answer": "Hi deb;I left a post for you on the Microvascular forum site today. If you don't get it just let me know. I've had signs since 2005. Nitro patchs are my friend but I still get break thru chest tightness, pain, and some shortness of breath. Read my journal here at 'joanincarolina'. I'll be more than happy to answer any questions and I'll be anxious to learn about your experience and where you are with the angina process. I'm a little different than you in that you have diabetes and known blockages; I have no other problems other than the variant angina but our angina is probably very similar.I'm looking forward to hearing from you. Joan.",
