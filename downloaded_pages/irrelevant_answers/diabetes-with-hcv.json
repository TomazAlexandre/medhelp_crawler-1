Therefore, treatment with metformin could be beneficial in this setting.To investigate, Dr. Emmanuel Cosson, with Hopital Jean Verdier in Bondy and Paris-Nord University, and colleagues studied a prospective cohort of 100 consecutive patients with ongoing HCV cirrhosis and type 2 diabetes, 26 of whom were treated with metformin.During follow-up for a median of 5.7 years, 39 patients developed HCC and 33 either died of liver-related causes or underwent a liver transplant, according to the report.The team found that the 5-year rate of HCC was 9.5% among the group receiving metformin compared with 31.2% in those who did not. On multivariate analysis, metformin was independently associated with reduced risk of HCC (hazard ratio 0.19, p=0.023).Similarly, the corresponding rate of death or transplantation was 5.9% vs 17.4% in the two groups, respectively. This translated to an adjusted hazard ratio for death/transplantation of 0.22 (p=0.049), Dr. Cosson and colleagues report.They note that this was an observational study, so cause and effect cannot be determined. \u201cHowever,\u201d they conclude, \u201cour findings add to the increasing body of evidence and may justify the initiation of clinical trials evaluating metformin in patients with hyperinsulinemia and HCV cirrhosis.\u201dReference:Impact of Metformin on the Prognosis of Cirrhosis Induced by Viral Hepatitis C in Diabetic PatientsJ Clin Endocrinol Metab 2011;96.",

            "answer": "I'm quite interested in the association between diabetes and HCV.\u00a0\u00a0However, all the research seems to be with type 2 diabetes, either 'caused' by HCV treatment or in association with HCV chronic infection.I wonder how many people there are who have HCV and were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes as adults...\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with type 1 in my early 20s.\u00a0\u00a0If I was infected with HCV when I think I was (tattoo in the early 80s), then my diagnosis of type 1 diabetes came a couple of years later.The liver stores sugar.\u00a0\u00a0In a person without T1 diabetes, the pancreas continually shoots out insulin through the day and the liver shoots out sugar stores.If there is damage to the liver, I imagine that process doesn't work as it should...",
