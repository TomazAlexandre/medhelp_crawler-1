    "question": "My husband was diagnosed with COPD, emphysema, a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0He was hospitalized for passing out and low oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0He also has had a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a057 years old, very overweight.\u00a0\u00a0General health is not real good as far as chloresterol and blood pressure and also Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He is also a heavy smoker.\u00a0\u00a0He will not quit smoking or start exercising, so that will not change.\u00a0\u00a0I have had to accept that.\u00a0\u00a0He feels if he takes his meds he will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Very deep seated denial and as I say, he won't change.\u00a0\u00a0The other night he got up wheezing very badly and coughing.\u00a0\u00a0He coughs alot of the time, especially during the night.\u00a0\u00a0He finally caught his breath and fell asleep in a chair for several hours.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that he will pass out again and am not sure of what to do if it happens other than calling 911.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I am looking for some signs to help me figure out if he is declining or staying stable.\u00a0\u00a0Please don't tell me to talk to him or for his doctor to talk to him about what he is doing to himself.\u00a0\u00a0As I said he is in denial and for my own health I have had to accept it.\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to figure out what I am facing so I can be prepared.\u00a0\u00a0At some point in time we have to accept certain things in life even if we don't like to.\u00a0\u00a0That is where I am and I feel I have to be ready to handle whatever is handed me.",
