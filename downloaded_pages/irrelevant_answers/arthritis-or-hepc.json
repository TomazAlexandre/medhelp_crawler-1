            "answer": "i have a desk job so i'm familiar with pains in my back, shoulder blade, carpal tunnel, etc. even before tx started. however, after tx started those pains have really intensified to a point i figured i must do something about it.perhaps others can expand on the benefits of massage, stretching, and yoga. for me tho i've not been dedicated enough about these activities to experience the benefits. so far the relief is only temporary & the pains return the next day if not just a few hours later.what helps for me is to drink plenty of water & over time, built up a high \"tolerance\". i'm not sure whether if it's one of the side effects anyways but after tx started, i often feel extreme thirst, especially in the mornings. the sensation of feeling completely hydrated has a strange effect to keep the joint/muscle pain at bay. the only downside to drinking water is frequent restroom stops, even in the middle of the night.deep breathing also helps for me. it seems like a silly thing to say but i find that i frequently have to \"remind\" myself to breath. when i forget to and return to my usual, shallow breaths, the pain \"accumulates\" to a point i become irritable and grumpy. but once i do remember to breath deeply, it feels like i can \"breath the pain away\".for sure tho, i feel the aches a lot less on the days i do remember to drink plenty water and to breath deeply than on the days it gets crazy at the office and i forget to. i came across numerous posts rgd positive changes in lifestyles & i think this is definitely it for me. i enjoy drinking water and deep breathing so much nowadays i think i will definitely continue doing so even after the tx ends.hope this helps!",

            "answer": "Bre, autoimmune disorders such as arthritis following TX can be an unfortunate side from treatment.\u00a0\u00a0You should get back with your physician or connect with a rhumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0I personally believe that arthritis is not well understood and that the sides of TX are also not well understood.\u00a0\u00a0For this reason it may be better to try to search out a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0You could end up getting a better DX or better care.\u00a0\u00a0It is my understanding that it's important to treat such auto immune disorders since the damage can be progressive and permanent.\u00a0\u00a0So....if it is an auto immune disorder you could find yourself on a treatment which could arrest the damage and mitigate the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Understand, this is just one possibility, not a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0You might also choose some \"key words\" and use the search engine of this forum or google.\u00a0\u00a0There should be quite a few threads here and people who you can connect with once you get a better idea of what's going on.Ebuidy, speaking of search or google...... extreme thirst is a common symptom of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I would urge you to visit a dr and get it checked out.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes has a strong association with HCV infection.\u00a0\u00a0We have a greater likelihood a diabetes occurence that those uninfected with HCV.\u00a0\u00a0It's very important; get it checked out.\u00a0\u00a0I actually think it's something that all heppers should do at least once whether they are positive or have cleared.\u00a0\u00a0Check it out and good luck.best,Willy",

The TX was difficult, however worth it! There was a huge possibility for success. I am just trying to understand more about this Hep C. I try to push it to the back of my mind and then it just pops back up at one point ot another. I am good though.Bre",

Rivera J, Garc\u00eda-Monforte A, Pineda A, Mill\u00e1n N\u00fa\u00f1ez-Cort\u00e9s J.Instituto Provincial de Rehabilitaci\u00f3n, Internal Medicine Department, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Mara\u00f1\u00f3n, Madrid, Spain. ***@****OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical picture of arthritis in patients with chronic infection by hepatitis C virus (HCV). METHODS: Two patient populations were studied. Patients with arthritis and evidence of serum elevation of alanine aminotransferase (ALT) at the consultation were checked for HCV infection. A second group of 303 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) were also checked for the presence of HCV antibodies. All patients attended the outpatient rheumatology unit of a tertiary care teaching hospital. Chronic HCV infection was determined by the presence of viral RNA in serum. A group of 315 first-time blood donors served as controls. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients with arthritis and chronic HCV infection were identified. Seven fulfilled criteria for RA, psoriatic arthritis was found in one patient, systemic lupus erythematosus in one, gout in 2, chondrocalcinosis in 2, osteoarthritis in 7, and tenosynovitis in one. In 7 patients with a clinical picture of intermittent arthritis, a definitive diagnosis could not be made. In these patients, mixed cryoglobulinemia was present in 6/7 (86%), whereas mixed cryoglobulinemia was found in 6/21 (28%) of the other patients. Among patients with RA, 23 (7.6%) had HCV antibodies, and active infection by HCV was found in 7 (2.3%) patients. The prevalence of HCV antibodies in a blood donor population was 0.95%, significantly different (p<0.001; 95% CI 0.03, 0.10) compared to patients with RA. The distribution of antibodies determined by recombinant immunoblot analysis was similar (p = NS) between RA patients and blood donors with HCV antibodies. CONCLUSION: There is not a single clinical picture of arthritis in patients with chronic HCV infection. There is a well defined picture of arthritis associated with the presence of mixed cryoglobulinemia that consists of an intermittent, mono or oligoarticular, nondestructive arthritis affecting large and medium size joints. Although a high prevalence of HCV antibodies is suspected in patients with RA, its occurrence may be coincidental and its interpretation is difficult to determine from the data in this study.PMID: 9972979 [PubMed - indexed for MEDLINE]",
