            "answer": "I think it is supposed to vary according to the individual. There is not really a time line, as some people improve, some worsen.Also, although you have to be a 15 to get in the list, I believe you have to be around 20-24, toget an actual transplant.Regarding Hep C, from what I read, I am no expert mind you,\u00a0\u00a0they seem to be developing new drugs and treatments all the time, so you never know.Sorry, but I have no info on the joint pain.Best wishes!",

            "answer": "I agree with wq2 that is not possible to predict accurately a time line for your MELD score.I would also suggest that you get another opinion about whether you are too late for treatment. I was told the same thing and I was eventually transplanted. But, had I known then what I know now I would have sought out another opinion and I think I very well could have treated. Would I have been successful. I don't know that but at least I would have had a chance to avoid transplantation. I am not complaining because in many ways I have been extremely fortunate. I received a liver 10+ years ago and I eradicated the HCV over 6 years ago. Nevertheless I would have liked to have gotten another expert opinion about treatment. Compensated cirrhotics often times can treat and can be successful. The odds aren't great but there is often a chance. And wq2 is right about the new drugs. Protease inhibitors combined with Pegylated interferon and ribavirin are increasing the likelihood of HCV clearance and, in some cases, shortening treatment duration. It is expected that at least one protease inhibitor and maybe 2 will be available in 2011. So work hard and be your own advocate is my best advice.Good luck,Mike",

    "question": "Hi, I'm stuck in the middle, I have Hep C, Diabetes type 2, Ascities,Varices (7), Low blood pressure, and extreme joint pain to boot. My Doc says I'm too late in the game for Interferon treatment and yet not sick enough to be put on the \"LIST\" for transplant. I have a meld score of 8 and am told it has to\u00a0\u00a0be 15 to be a member on the list. Does any one happen to know approximately how long it will take to get to 15? Also, is joint pain associated with this disease or could this be a side effect of all the meds I'm taking? P.S.\u00a0\u00a0It's fatty liver type if that makes any diff.Thanks in advance! I'm 47 and hope one day to be a grandma.",
