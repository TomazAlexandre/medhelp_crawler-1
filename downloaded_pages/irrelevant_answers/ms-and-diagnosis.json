            "answer": "Why do you think it is MS? Your symptoms sound like they could be caused by liver issues to me, you should have your liver enzymes checked out. Get tested for hep a b and c just for peace of mind while you are at it and be checked for fatty liver or other liver ailments.",

I could NOT move!\u00a0\u00a0It was very frightening - and I have felt \"weird\" since it happened.\u00a0\u00a0As we speak, my left side is not completely numb - just loss of sensation.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's scarry and we all think the worst.\u00a0\u00a0I know I do - I have a history of heart disease, diabetes, MS, ALS, and breast cancer in my family!\u00a0\u00a0Geez....no wonder I'm having problems!\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, the MRI will help to ease your fears.Good Luck and Peace to you,Charley",

    "question": "I recently went to the neurologist for several symtoms- Upon examination she said my movements were normal.\u00a0\u00a0However I am a 35 year old female and she wants to rule out MS.\u00a0\u00a0I have no history of MS in the family but my symptoms are the following: Cold extremities, memory problems, muscle weakness etc.\u00a0\u00a0My question is I am extremely anemic and have neck and lower back problems- Is it possible that my symptoms are from some of these things?\u00a0\u00a0I am suppose to take an MRI and am afraid of the test. I was in it once before and had a panic attack and I am not a clostrophobic person generally.\u00a0\u00a0I think I am also afraid of the results.\u00a0\u00a0I am young and getting married this fall and I am hoping that these symptoms could possibly be a collection of other things that arent quite as serious. Can neck problems cause weakness in arms and legs and \" brain fog\" ?\u00a0\u00a0I am heavy and losing weight and very out of shape- I was hoping that the muscle fatigue I have thru out my body is from being out of shape and lack of exercise.",
