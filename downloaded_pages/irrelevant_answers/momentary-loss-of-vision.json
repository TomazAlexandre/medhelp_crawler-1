            "answer": "Doctor - I have a question I hope you can answer as well. Every so often, esp while driving, I'll notcie that my eys ae getting blurry. Not teribly blurry, but a quick hard blink makes it normal again. It dont happen when Im walking around, hanging out, or on the computer. Never happens walking in the mall, or around town. ONLY when driving.\u00a0\u00a0An eye doctor said I was fine; that was back in May. This thing has been occurring off and on since April or so, and will do so just once a day (as in it wont occur repeatedly). It hasnt gotten worse, and no pain of any kind occurs with these 2 - 3 second long events. I am at a computer all day, and maybe that has something to do with it? OMG or is it macular degeneration, or optic neuritis????I always worry about MS, MD, Fibro (sheesh, Im a guy, too!), ALS, and everything else. I rarely leave my computer as Im on google and wikipedia and medhelp like every day. Please tell me what I can do, or if I should worry??",

            "answer": "Almost all serious problems do not clear with a few blinks. When vision blurs then clears with a couple of blilnks its usually due to dry spots on the cornea. While driving the cornea often drys due to Air condition or heating blown into face and while using computer because blink rate decreases.See a Eye MD ophthalmologist for a eye exam and a GP or Internist for a physical. If you pass both tests. Stop trying to give yourself some rare dread disease.JCH MD",

            "answer": "Hello Doctor, last week 15 minutes into the train ride home I suddenly felt lightheaded and nauseaus while I was standing. My legs felt weak, not the pins and needles type but like I really needed to sit down. Then my vision started to became blurry and darken until I couldn't see anyone or anything. Luckily I was holding on to the pole otherwise I would of toppled over. I felt a strong urge to vomit. Then 3-4 stops later (3-4 mins) just as I was about to alight my vision gradually returned. I began to see distinct silhouttes but it was as if I was looking at a negative film roll. I felt hot and cold and welcomed the fresh air. I ate properly that day, I was drinking for around 4 hours that afternoon/ evening but I was neither tipsy or drunk. The train wasn't packed but most seats were taken. The train carriage was rather smelly- body odour, sweaty socks, someone farted so it wasn't pleasant to breath in and thus it was stuffy. I'm female and only 25, nothing like this has ever happened to me before and I'm not aware if my family has a history with nerves. My paternal grandad and maternal grandma have diabetes. But it certainly hasn't happened to my mum. I saw a GP who referred me to see a neurologist. Im very worried!",
