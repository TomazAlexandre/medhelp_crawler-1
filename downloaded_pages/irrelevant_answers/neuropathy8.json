    "question": "I have just recently been told by an m.d that I have neuropathy. This causes burning,numbness,stabbing pains, and also tingling to the feet. The worst time is in the night. I am scheduled to see a neurologist seeing how the m.d. ran blood tests for anything to his knowledge that could be causing this including diabetes. It is very confusing I am only 34 and this suddenly struck. Does anybody have any knowledge on this subject? What helps besides drugs I wont become a pill popper unless absolutely necessary.",
