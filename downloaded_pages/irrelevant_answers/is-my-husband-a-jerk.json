You are pregnant and overly sensitive so he should've realized that...even even you weren't pregnant a joke along the same line would've been rude and a little mean-spirited but I would just explain that it upset you and put it behind you....I'm sorry he did it though, it was in poor taste.",

My husband loves to joke around with me so much, so I would expect him to do something like that to me, especially on april fools!\u00a0\u00a0I would probably be a mess and mad at first, but then I would laugh it off and probably want to punch him. lol It's okay girl!! I don't think he was being a jerk, but maybe he should have been a little more sensitive about the matter.",

            "answer": "I think it was in poor taste as well, but he probably wasn't too concerned that it was an actual issue to begin with and didn't realize how much it really upset you. I would talk to him, but try not to go crazy about it. Some people just don't think things through clearly and that sounds like the case here.",

Plus at least he didn't make you dwell on it and think you had it all day and then say April fools. If anything I'd look at the bigger picture and just be relieved that you don't have to worry about it anymore.",

But I have a mishevious & healthy sense of humor. I wouldn't be so upset about it and id probably smack him and laugh at his reaction to that! LOL *cheer up honey! You actually got GOOD news today*",

            "answer": "My DH is the same way. He doesnt seem to understand the emotions pregnancy can bring. But he's always been like that..kinda insensitive. So after 9 years it really doesnt bother me, he wasn't taught how to show his emotions. If he wouldv'e done that to me I wouldv'e been upset for like a second. But that's just me. I don't let petty things get to me. Yes that is a serious subject and yes it was wrong but look at the bright side...you dont have GB.",

Oh and he was going to play the joke out longer but I started crying so he let me in on the joke. I also got over it and took my revenge. My mom came and got my daughter today so I had her call me when they were like 20 min away.\u00a0\u00a0I pretended she got in a car crash and told him she was not wearing her seat belt and that they were going to have to take her to the hospital in a ambulance. Any way he freaked out I was crying the hole nine I got him hook line and sinker he was quite upset when I told him APRIL FOOLS but he was only mad for a moment and then he laughed and was a good sport about it. He did tell me that he was mad at me anymore and he was sorry that he was so mean to me.",

    "question": "I am 29 weeks pregnant I went in and had the test to see about Diabetes and mine came back high so I was told to go to the hospital and have another test done that is more in depth. So I am upset after I read about all the things that can go wrong the chances I am a worrier any way. So I went for the other test on wed could not eat for 16 hours had to be poked 4 time with a needle and I HATE needles. Any way this hole time 3 days I am upset can't eat no sleep crying all the time thinking of my babys health and my husband was ok he would listen to me and tell me not to worry. So today the doc office called him not me for some reason and gave him the good news that I do not have diabetes. So he calls me and tells me I just go the call I am sorry you have diabetes im sorry of course I am upset start to cry oh no then he yells APRIL FOOLS. So my poll is should I be be upset because I am so mad I could spit fire I do not think he should have ever joked about that. Let me know what you think.",
