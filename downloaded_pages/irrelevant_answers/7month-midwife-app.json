            "answer": "When they check to see if you have gestational diabetes which is a form of diabetes that only appears during pregnancy and usually goes away afterwards....what happens is your midwife will tell you to stop eating after a certain time and you will only be able to drink water after that...then the next day you will drink a real sugary drink n sit n the office from an hr up to 3hrs n then they will draw your blood...is not bad tho I promise!",
