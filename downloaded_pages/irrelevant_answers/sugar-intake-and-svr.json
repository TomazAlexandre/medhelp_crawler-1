            "answer": "Hi Dave,I think as long as you\u2019re metabolizing carbohydrates properly, there shouldn\u2019t be any issues. If not, there might be some concern with insulin resistance and its relationship with sustained response.Do you have a family history of diabetes or any problems with it yourself in the past? Type II diabetes is usually associated with how we metabolize carbohydrates; we develop resistance to our own insulin; the stuff we make doesn\u2019t work efficiently any more.There are tests like the HOMA IR that can quantify insulin resistance, and a simple fingerstick test can check your blood sugar.And I tend to agree with pcds; diabetes is a b!tch to deal with; I\u2019ve had to manage it for over 8 years now, and it\u2019s always in the background nagging at me :o).--Bill",

I didn't feel like eating it, but I didn't feel like eating anything. Maybe the feeling better was a coincidence, maybe not. I honestly feel like it helped overall. Bear in mind that people with cirrhosis need to be mindful of where they get their protein from and how they can end up with too much ammonia because of it. But those of us who don't have that kind of liver damage don't need to worry.Once I thought about it, I realized it made sense that with the onslaught of the tx drugs and how they seemed to be breaking me down that it would be helpful to have protein to build myself back up.",

            "answer": "No, the A1c test \u2018histories back\u2019 blood sugar levels. It\u2019s also known as a \u2018glycated (or glycosylated) hemoglobin\u2019 test, Dave. Wiki has an article on it; this covers the basic principals:~~~~~~~~~~~~~\u201cIn the normal 120-day lifespan of the red blood cell, glucose molecules react with hemoglobin, forming glycated hemoglobin. In individuals with poorly controlled diabetes, the quantities of these glycated hemoglobins are much higher than in healthy people.Once a hemoglobin molecule is glycated, it remains that way. A buildup of glycated hemoglobin within the red cell, therefore, reflects the average level of glucose to which the cell has been exposed during its life-cycle. Measuring glycated hemoglobin assesses the effectiveness of therapy by monitoring long-term serum glucose regulation. The HbA1c level is proportional to average blood glucose concentration over the previous four weeks to three months. Some researchers state that the major proportion of its value is related to a rather shorter period of two to four weeks.\u201dhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glycated_hemoglobin~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~In essence, the A1c test \u2018histories back\u2019 our serum blood sugar by measuring how much sugar coats a red blood cell after a known life span of 120 days. Importantly, we need to be very cautious using the A1c test during HCV therapy. The test gives skewed results during HCV treatment because the ribavirin causes hemolytic anemia, and this affects the lifespan of the red blood cell; sometimes dramatically. Again from the same page in\u00a0\u00a0wiki:\u201cLower-than-expected levels of HbA1c can be seen in people with shortened red blood cell lifespan, such as with glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, sickle-cell disease, or any other condition causing premature red blood cell death. On the converse, higher-than-expected levels can be seen in people with a longer red blood cell lifespan, such as with Vitamin B12 or folate deficiency.\u201dI\u2019m not so sure the A1c result is indicative of insulin resistance, other than indirectly because higher blood sugar values can be attributed to IR at times. Importantly, be sure to discuss the use of A1c with a clinician if they order it during HCV treatment, Dave.Bill",

            "answer": "Dave,Fasting glucose <100 is normal; 100 to 125 is considered pre-diabetic, and greater than 125 (again fasting) is suggestive of a diabetic condition.Insulin resistance is where the body doesn\u2019t properly/efficiently utilize endogenous (what our body makes) insulin. Because of that resistance, blood sugar often increases unless we intervene somehow; this could be pills to decease IR such as metformin, or possibly injecting supplemental insulin; either one tends to work.However, it\u2019s quite possible to have virtually no insulin resistance accompanied with elevated blood sugar levels; type 1 diabetics are an example. Their pancreas don\u2019t produce insulin, so their blood sugar rises; but they don\u2019t normally have issues with insulin resistance. Am I confusing you? I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019m saying this correctly. If not, I\u2019ll try a different tact.A good article that covers all this is here, at the NIDDK site:http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/insulinresistance/It\u2019s a bit of reading, but really informative if you believe you might have issues, well worth the read.--Bill",
