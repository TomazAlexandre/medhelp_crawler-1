            "answer": "Hi!Since the leg pain is bilateral, it can be due to spinal nerve compression in the lumbo-sacral region. It can also be due to peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus. At times high blood pressure causes dull aching sensation in both legs.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",

    "question": "i am a 25 yr old female who is apart from the pain otherwise physically fit. i have had bilateral lower leg pain for over 2 years now and still none of the medical staff i have seen know what is causing it. it began as shooting pains UP both achilles tendons, they put this down to tendonitis/tendinopathy with no diagnostic tests other than looking and poking. they have never been red or swollen! the pain is sometimes electric like nerve pain, sometimes dul and achey like a fracture, sometimes feels like a torn muscle, sometimes burns but not to touch just within, and sometimes the muscles all around my shin and ankle feel asthough they are itching inside. I also get random stabbing pains in calfs, achilles and around ankle joint. all of the pains come on at random intervals, but pain seems to be worse durin menstrual cycle. pains initial onset was doing hurdle jumps at football training but, even if that was achilles tendonitis it would not cause all these other effects. i have had am mri an there is \"nothing structurally wrong\" i have had power tests and passed all with flying colours, and everyone is baffled as to whats causing it. no one has looked into my lumbar spine yet as this is the only explanation i can think of but surely this would only cause nerve pain and not the burning and dul achey pains aswell? i just want to get to the bottom of it to get rid of it because it is driving me mad! also after exercise my legs shake, this also happens at any point when i walk down stairs. any ideas at all? would be really greatful if anyone is or knows anyone with anything similar. ps heel dips/raises by the shed load from numerous physios have done nothing, neither did nerve stretches. and i have no numbness",
