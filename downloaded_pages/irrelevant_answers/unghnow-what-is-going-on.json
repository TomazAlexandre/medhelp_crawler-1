    "question": "My name is Leslie, and I'm 38 years old.\u00a0\u00a0Iwas Dx'd in 1999 with Fibromyalgia. Before that it was IBS in 1992, and Migraines in 1990.\u00a0\u00a0In 2003, my Dr. sent me to the neurologist for an MRI suspecting that MS. The MRI came back negative at that time for brain lesions, but revealed a herniated bulge in my C5-7. my doctor of many years retired shortly thereafter. At the time,I was living in on the east coast and now reside in NW Arkansas.\u00a0\u00a0To date, no medications have helped except a couple which help take an edge off the extreme pain, but nothing relieves me enough to where I feel \"well\". I fight not to have to use my cane or wheelchairs.\u00a0\u00a0Two years ago at age 36, was Dx'd with Diabetes Type II and last year with Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease. with erosion to my esophagus and duodenum. In the last couple months however, I've begun having lower facial spasms around my left cheek and mouth area. I feel lucky to get much of anything done anymore and the ability to do a lot despite water exercising is minimal. This concerns my husband and I. Any thoughts?",
