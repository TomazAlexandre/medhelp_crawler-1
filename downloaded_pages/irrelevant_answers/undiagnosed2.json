            "answer": "Hi,How are you?I would suggest you to get a blood sugar test done to rule out diabetes. In the meantime you can take a B12 supplement available OTC and make sure you do some back exercises and exercises of your shoulder joint and hip.Hopefully your symptoms will improve after this. Take care!",

Degenerative disk disease runs in my family.I've looked at the CTs and can see fuzzy areas and black spots..still you want to tell me nothing is wrong?",

            "answer": "Hi,Most of the degenerative disc diseases can be managed by conservative treatment alone which includes rest, physical therapy, ice packs and oral pain medications. Without looking at your reports and clinical examination it is difficult to tell the extent of damage. I would suggest you to seek a second opinion with a neurologist.",

    "question": "I can't get an answer! I have lower and sometimes sever lower back pain L1-L2. I have joint pain in my right hip that can cause me to fall suddenly (electrical shock like pain). There is a place in the center of my back where I feel numb, oblivious to a needle *****. My right shoulder often aches and I get sever carpel tunnel like symptoms in my right forearm and wrist. Doctors (5) have stated that nothing is wrong. My X-rays show no arthritis, although L2 is displaced at a 17 degree angle, visible on a CT. Standing for over 20 minutes increases pain, longer becomes unbearable. Seated positions do not help. I'm at my wits end, can no longer function at an acceptable level and can not pass a physical...(but nothing is wrong per the local doctors). HELP!!!!!.",
