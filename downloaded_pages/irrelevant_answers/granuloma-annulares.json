            "answer": "I have started walking and when I would come home found that my legs itched insatiably and would swell up like hives.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually they became blotches on my calves. Then I noticed a quarter size purple red spot on the top of my foot. Then 2 dime sized circles on my hand.\u00a0\u00a0The foot purple mark enlarged three times the orig. size.\u00a0\u00a0The ones on my hand I had a dermatologist inject with cortizone, which sorta killed the disease and stopped the ich.\u00a0\u00a0My legs now after about 2 years are a purple blotchy mess different than the circles on my hand.\u00a0\u00a0Under my arms there is a double ring like 50 cent pieces.I have them on my outer thighes and inside of them.\u00a0\u00a0I asked the doctor if this all is the same thing and she said yes but they look different.\u00a0\u00a0I was also told that they connect this with a possible thyroid problem or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am terrified that it will come on my face since it seems to have no boundaries.\u00a0\u00a0I am 62 years old....why now?",

            "answer": "This is years later and I'm sorry I couldn't have helped sooner. I have the same type of spot in the same location you specified as well as another on the top of my opposite foot. It's been diagnosed as Granuloma Annulare. Unfortunately Ive had it for about a year now. I started seeking answers to what it was 6 months after it apeared. Now another 6 has gone by and it hasn't gotten better. The Dermatologist started with a steroid cream and that hasn't helped. I'm waiting to hear the next course of action.",

    "question": "when my daughter was young-she had a spot right above her ankle. it was raised and brownish-red. the doctors said itwas like a fungus that soldiers had whose feet were constantly wet. eventually it when away(after 1 1/2 - 2 years)but the doctors said it would probably come back later in life, and being on ankle was unusual. have you ever heard of this?This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/240509\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/240509</a>.",
