            "answer": "I'm not sure what you mean by short-term fix. There is a medical protocol to treat the symptoms if any.\u00a0\u00a0Having 100% aorta blockage and not having heart failure or cardiac arrest indicates there are other vessels in the heart that supply blood to the area normally supplied by the area distal to the blockage.\u00a0\u00a0Medication can be therapy of choice if there is relief from any heart related symptoms due to ischemia (lack of blood flow).\u00a0\u00a0If medication doesn't help, then a stent implant or a bypass.Treatment for peripheral artery disease has two major goals. The first is to manage symptoms, such as leg pain, so that you can resume physical activities. The second is to stop the progression of atherosclerosis throughout your body to reduce your risk of heart attack and stroke.An individual may be able to accomplish these goals with lifestyle changes. If your sister-in-law\u00a0\u00a0smokes, quitting is the single most important thing you can do to reduce the risk of complications.If lifestyle changes are not enough, you need additional medical treatment. The doctor may prescribe medicine to prevent blood clots, lower blood pressure and cholesterol, and control pain and other symptoms.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for sharing.",
