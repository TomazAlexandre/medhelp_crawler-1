            "answer": "I have been diagnosed met with a nutritionist so I can control it through diet. If you aren't on meds then you have to watch the carbs you eat per meal. My diet plan consists of 30 g of carbs per meal. Special k exceeds that in 1 serving. You should try to avoid breads, pastas, and watch your carb intake. Veggies and protein is alright and no limit on it. Try googling a diet to follow online and good luck.",

    "question": "I was told I have gestational diabetes I failed my glucose test by being over by 9. I have check my blood 4 times a day. I'm usually in 60s,70,80s,and 90s. My highs are once in a great while being 126 or 138. But the past couple of days I've been getting ridiculous readings. Ate one bowl of special k didn't eat or drink anything other than water checked my blood 2 hours later and got a reading of 159. I haven't done anything different. And I was told I don't need medication or to be on a diet. But I was wondering if this has happened to anyone else? Or if anyone knows why it's suddenly giving me these high numbers. Also if anyone knows of any sites with meal plans for gestational diabetes that'd be very helpful.",
