            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0You need to get a tilt table test to rule out postural hypotension/syncope/dysautonomia. Also, you should have gait test and test for balance. Ear should be examined for wax. infection and blockage. Other tests which may help are round the clock sugar monitoring, holter to rule out arrhythmia and situational hypotension/hypertension, blood tests for electrolytes, vitamin B12, vitamin D and hyperparathyroidism. Some sleep disturbances can also make you feel unbalanced during the day. So, it may be worthwhile to undergo sleep studies.Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.
