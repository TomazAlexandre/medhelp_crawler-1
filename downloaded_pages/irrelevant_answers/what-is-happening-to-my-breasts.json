            "answer": "if the doctor doesn't find anything wrong with you try doing push ups, though if they are already fallen down, pretty much there's nothing the chest muscle can do to lift (or fill), also, wear a bra, one that supports not the type that look like sports bra, though again, once fallen...if it bothers you to a point of desperation you might want to consider surgery. I know the bra and the push ups work because first of all, the bra helps with gravity (force of attraction towards earth) day by day gravity takes a toll on your body parts, and the push ups, well its a small muscle but it does help to keep them lifted.From personal experience, I am almost 28 (so close to 30 :S) 34C, have had weight gain and loss constantly BUT my boobs have always remained in place, thankfully they are still full and firm and its all because of the push ups (I used to do taekwondo so lots of push ups) and because I'm so lazy I sleep with my bra on. If you take a look at pictures of women who belong to tribes, who do not wear anything on the top part of their bodies, including no bra, what do they all have in common??? YES sagging boobs, from very early age.",
