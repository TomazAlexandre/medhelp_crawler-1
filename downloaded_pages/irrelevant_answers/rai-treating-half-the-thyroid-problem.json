            "answer": "I have many patients who do fine post-RAI and the hypothyroidism is well treated and tolerated.Any method of treating hyper usually causes some weight gain as the thyroid-related-metabolism is falsely elevated during hyper and then is brought back to normal.Thyroid specialists are endocrinologists who have dedicated their practice in large part to thyroid conditions rather than other endocrine conditions like diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The choice or RAI vs ATD varies from specialist to specialist.\u00a0\u00a0 Recent data on 10 year use of ATD suggest this is safe if closely monitored and the patient is responding well.\u00a0\u00a0RAI or surgery is my back-up plan if ATD treatment is not going well.....",

            "answer": "Dr. Lupo I do appreciate your time in answering my question and assuaging my fears in the regards of the ATD option of treating my hyperthyroidism, I have a good few years I can take this route for.So how do I got about finding out if the endo that I am going to is a thyroid specialist, do I check for different abbrevations to make sure thier title does not include the diabetes portion of their training? The last time I asked an MD if they were thyroid speicialist or not they seem quite nasty to me but when it was time to fork over the 560 dollars for the consultation visit I never felt more scolded like a child for asking any questions of a MD of his stature, god forbid. It seems that one or two endo's I went to I feel like I can't ask any questions and they seem very desensitized\u00a0\u00a0by all these thyroid issues, treating my reports like a text book case, it's very disheartening to me.-Gilda741",

            "answer": "diabetes is part of all endocrine training -\u00a0\u00a0and >90% of endo's have a >70% diabetes practice -- leaving less time for thyroid.....would look at thyroidologists.com or thyroid.org -- these are mostly thyroid-focused endocrinologists.560 for a consultation!\u00a0\u00a0I hope that included labs and ultrasound and at least 40 minutes of time -- I should not comment on that, but it is a reflection of a flawed healthcare system....",

            "answer": "Dr. Lupo I didn't want to write down the fee price on there but to demostratate that consultation fee did not include anything but this supposed \"Renowned\" endo skimming my lab reports in a matter of 2 mins and then since I mentioned I have no health insurance due to my lost job he prescribed me generic Methimazole & Metoprolooll (beta blocker I think). Then I spent a milisecond asking him before he bum rushed me in a record 8 mins do these generic brand meds have any side effects, to which he replied back if you don't take these your digging your own graves with heart, liver & bone marrow problems. I gently broached the same question in a different way and stillhe said if you don't take these I will have to perform RAI on you no matter what. I looked around for the nearest EXIT sign to his office, that HURT.Then I said what about the filler ingredients, then he got more seething livid that I would question his highly educated knowledge & training about RAI & just showed me the door, I am a grown woman of 36 years old, I have never felt these odd setting symptoms in my life I eat right and excercise, this hyper prb came out of nowhere for me. Still this health care system is out to punish me when I am at my worst so I have no choice & I bow down to any doctor who could spend a lousy 5 mins to tell me this hyper thyroid prb is manageable w/o forcing & scaring me into RAI. Funny thing is when I mention to the doc that I didn't want to do RAI as my 1st option the consultation turned into an immediate angry farce, not to mention a waste of time for him and lost hope for me, I didn't know he would need to do more labs or even a ultrasound? God that hurts all that money I spend about an average 300 dollars on each endo to be told RAI is the ONLY way. But this doc I thought for sure he would at least work with me or listen to me ask questions no matter how stupid they are, he didn't even seem interested to deal with a full paying charity case like me, never felt so ignored by a doc in my time of need.I thought I was getting good care but at a high price, I thought if the endo was recommended it must be good but almost fell into that thyroid storm, he gave me a an appt 4 months down the road is this a fashion amongest endo's handing out these far appt dates too.Just on beta blocker afraid of taking Methimazole, took for 3 weeks could not stop itching and my hair was coming out, politey begged this same endo to switch me to name brand of Methimazole, he had audacity to say side effects in my head, I told him I had severe red itchy welts on my body, he ignored my plea and threatened me with RAI again. I used the words please and thank you but as a patient do I have any rights Dr. Lupo, he was recommended as the god of treating Hyperthyroid but his desenistized bed manner leaves me stuck with him, don't have much more on funds to go endo shopping yet again.",

            "answer": "I am completely petrified of RAI not one endo that I have seen can explain to me thepros and cons of RAI in layman's term. They (endo's) have the only one way to scare patients and that's by telling them RAI is theonly way unless you want to die, some endo's have the audacity to instigate fear like that.But there was another poster in the patient to patient forum where a poster named annag966 put a somewhat of a pro's and con's list that I just read and it pretty much helped me make and stick to my decision of taking ATD's to treat my Graves. I always check with my MD for any type of advice but I like that these boards allow a communication of sorts so no matter how rough being hyper and hypo tends to get everyone gets a chance to exchange ideas and feedback.",

            "answer": "I had RAI in Feb.,05. That was the only choice I was given by my physican. I asked abou t surgery instead & I was told it was too dangerous. I was in no shape to shop around for other doctors...my TSH was not detectable & my T-4 was 3x's normal. I was informed of\u00a0\u00a0the precautions following the treatment but not the possible side effects short term or long term. I have had some major problems with thyroid eye disease. Would this have happened with ATD's? I'll never know? But with ATD's there is a chance that your thyroid could recover without losing complete function as you do with RAI. In my opinion, ATD's are worth a try, if you can tolerate the medicine.\u00a0\u00a0It's alittle more work for you & the doctor has to monitor you closer but it's personal preference & your body.\u00a0\u00a0There are some who have had no problem with RAI but no one should be forced into something they do not want you have the right to refuse.Good Luck & God Bless,TJ",

            "answer": "I guess it's a little too late for me now (about 6hrs). Just had RAI today because the doctors told me that was my \"best\" option for my toxic nodular goitre. I was also told that it would get bigger down the road, and my only option then would be surgery(hated the thoughts of that one even more). I had a bit of a problem with my eyes but nothing drastic, just a bit of swelling, which was the way I even discovered I was hyper.\u00a0\u00a0Like I just said---too late for me now and I'm sure praying for a good outcome. By the way, my aunt had the RAI 18 years ago, she is still alive and well and skinnier than she was as a teenager. They have been doing this RAI for over 50 years now, you can't say that about a lot of the medications that are on the market today---they're taking stuff off the shelf everyday for some medical reason or another.\u00a0\u00a0That's kind of scary too.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck in your decision, and good luck for mine too.",

    "question": "What is the difference between a thyroid specialist and an endo? Which one doesn\u2019t pressure you to have RAI done, tired of crying day in & day out when doc\u2019s pushing hard for RAI? Have not heard or seen one post mentioning RAI being a \u201csafer, better\u201d option and becoming hypo after RAI is just as difficult and its seems filled with more problems that being hyper. Can a person live on hyper ATD\u2019s for the rest of their life successfully, mind you I will always check with my physician but can they, if so how long (time span wise, months, years?) can this ATD route last a graves patient like myself? (please Dr. Lupo give me some decent news on this question)If I were to have RAI done, what guarantee do I have that as a hyper/graves patient that I am treating my hyper issue fully but then I would have to end up taking Synthroid is what I heard & also heard one gains more weight on that med no matter how careful there diet is or how many times a week they exercise.I\u2019m hyper & terrified of putting any food in my mouth NOW for fear of gaining any weight period. Imagine me going hypo then I would really lose my mind if I gain more weight due to yanking my thyroid glands out and still there are nasty antibodies floating around causing more trouble & have an endo gamble with my med dosages not sure about this RAI stuff at all? I think not one RAI patient has any iota of time to say RAI was good for me on these boards cause its probably not true at all, just my opinion. I am scared and newly dx with Graves, haven\u2019t had time to absorb the intensity of this situation, too busy arming myself with stats on how to go about treating my mild graves. Hurts to find that endo\u2019s most of them won\u2019t work with their patients, look at the lab reports carefully instead of skimming them or allow the patients to ask questions, 2 busy putting the fear of god in them with hyper/hypo symptoms, then their dx turns into oh by the way you need to have RAI done.
