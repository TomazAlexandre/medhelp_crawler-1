            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are a diabetic then consuming lots of sugars could make you susceptible to kidney and urinary infection and thus blood in urine. Other than that there is no co-relation. The most common cause of blood in urine is UTI. The next possible diagnosis is stone. The stone can be anywhere in the urinary system from kidney to urethra. Cancers of urinary system or some drugs too cause blood in urine. Bladder infections and cysts too can cause similar symptoms. In females vaginal and cervical infections and cancers along with uterine fibroids could be other possibilities. Your urologist will run a couple of tests including urine examination, a CT/ultrasound of abdomen to rule out stones and other causes.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
