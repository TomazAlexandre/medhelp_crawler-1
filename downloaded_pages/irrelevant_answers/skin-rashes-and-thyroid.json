            "answer": "Hi, not sure about meds and rashes. But rashes are associated with a variety of auto-immune diseases. And due to the fact that thyroid conditions are also often due to an auto-immune disease process which attacks the thyroid, people with thyroid disease are also at risk of other auto-immune conditions. I would ask your doc if the rash could be related to one.",

Went to every skin Dr and they were stumped..well I just had thyroid surgery to remmove toxic nodule and half my thyroid...guess what? The rash is finally clearing up all by it self now! Yaaaaay! Tell you Dr about it and insist you get your thyroid treated..myself I recomend the surgery over the radiation. A litter more painful but much safer esp for those of us with thyroid rash!",

            "answer": "It is nice to find someone who knows that rashes can be due to thyroid problems. I asked the Endocrinologist about the rashes and itching I have had for months about it...he said he doesn't really keep up with skin problems...what a dummy! I really need to find a doctor that actually know medicine...I told him the itching is driving me CRAZY and he had no clue. Thanks a bunch! Anyone know a good Endocrinologist in South Florida?",
