            "answer": "Thanks for the quick reply. I think I'll look into testing, just to feel better about it. I think the odds are very low that I got anything, but I know nothing about her, except that she worked at the school for a short time and is in her early 30's.About 15 years ago, I was helping to care for a friend who was dying from AIDS. I always had cuts on my hands from the lab work I did and I was putting pills into his mouth, which had open sores. I was too afraid of hurting his feelings to wear gloves. I was doing other little things for him, like massaging his feet and helping to brush his teeth, etc.I tested for HIV back then and even though I knew the odds were very low that I'd been infected, it made me feel better. So, maybe it'll make me feel better now, though I'm not worried enough to even remember it most of the time. I emailed our district nurse to ask her opinion just now.",

            "answer": "Teak,How could I have never been at risk from a needle stick deep enough to cut when I know nothing about the health history of the person whose needle it was?I agree it's low risk, but I don't really know if she had hepatitis or HIV or any other transmittable disease.",

    "question": "My child was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes several months ago. I give him insulin shots at school. Last year, I knocked over a sharps container with a rigged top that came loose. I quickly scooped up the contents with my bare hands, since I am the only one using the sharps container and I assumed it only had my son's needles in it, which were put back in caps and not bare anyway. I was pricked, however, with a pin needle of a type we don't use. I assumed that the needle belonged to another diabetic kid who hadn't been at school for several years and I didn't think about it again.Recently, I mentioned to the school staff that I'd pricked myself with this kid's needle and was informed that the needle was from an adult staff member who worked at the school for a short time last year. She was a recent adult diabetes diagnosis. I'd guess it's been about 5-6 months since the needle stick. Should I be tested for HIV and hepatitis? I don't know anything about the health history or lifestyle of the person who's needle I was stuck with.I've been sick a lot, but I've been under constant stress and our family is picking up all the viruses at school. Nevertheless, I've run a low grade fever for the last month and have not felt well. I figure this is coincidence.Suggestions?TIA.",
