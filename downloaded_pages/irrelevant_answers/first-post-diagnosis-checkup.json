            "answer": "Analise,Your son's first check up is, indeed a good result.\u00a0\u00a0Do encourage your son for doing his part to achieve this good result and try to reinforce what a GOOD thing he's been doing for his long term health.\u00a0\u00a0Munchkins rarely understand \"the future\" like that, but over time, he'll internalize those ideas.As you pointed out, there are a few urine tests that might've been done, so it's best to call the doc on Monday to ask what the normal range ... for the particular lab s/he used ... is.\u00a0\u00a0Seems that different labs use slightly different testing techniques, so that the \"lab normal\" from one lab won't be the same as that from another.I've had diabetes for ~33 years, and so it's been a long time since I was a \"kid\" with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, many endos are recommending an ACE inhibitor medication to protect diabetics' kidneys (and thus help ensure good urine test results for us).I'm not an MD, and I don't how young a DMer can be for this prevention to be considered, so perhaps you can talk to your endo about it at an upcoming visit.On the JDRF website, if you click the RESEARCH button, you'll be able to pull up a couple of reports on this subject.\u00a0\u00a0Here are the titles of 2 that you might find useful.(1) Research Provides Leads on Blocking Diabetic Kidney Disease: ACE Inhibitors:\u00a0\u00a012.04.2002 and(2)Avoidance And Reversal Of Complications",

            "answer": "Hi Annalise!\u00a0\u00a0First of all, I want to commend you for being involved with your son's diabetic care.\u00a0\u00a0It is so very important that the children know that they are not alone in dealing with their diabetes, especially in the beginning, and it's great that you came to us for help.\u00a0\u00a0I checked out the medhelp website and did a search on microalbumin.\u00a0\u00a0The information given listed the normal values for microalbuminuria to be 30 to 200 mg/day.\u00a0\u00a0That may be what you are looking for.\u00a0\u00a0I am a mom of a 16 year old who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months and I found it very informative.\u00a0\u00a0JDRF is also a great resource that I can recommend to you.\u00a0\u00a0If you aren't involved with JDRF already, I urge you to do so.\u00a0\u00a0It's a great organization that is there for you and your family.\u00a0\u00a0If you need any information on how to find your local chapter, just let me know.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there & keep up the good work!",

    "question": "Ny six-year-old son just had his first post-diagnosis checkup and the followup letter arrived in the mail today.\u00a0\u00a0It says his A1c is 7.6%, which, from what I understand is pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0And it says his thyroid function and lipid profile are normal.\u00a0\u00a0What I don't understand is the microalbumin/creatine ratio.\u00a0\u00a0I looked in our diabetes book and all over the Internet, and I can't seem to find a scale or chart that shows ranges for what is an acceptable number. He took a simple, in-office urine test.\u00a0\u00a0From what I can tell, there are several kinds of tests for microalbumin/creatine, which is why I can't figure out what his number means.\u00a0\u00a0My son did get the all-clear from the doctor, whom we don't have to see for another three months.\u00a0\u00a0Any guidance would be appreciated! (since it's Saturday and the endo's office is closed)",
