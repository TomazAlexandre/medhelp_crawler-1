            "answer": "Hello.I was wondering if the MRI lesions seen by your earlier doctor were visible to the Neurologist. And can you specify the disc levels?The muscle twitches and the other difficulties can be manifestations of compressive myelopathy.A complete nerve conduction study would have been helpful. Is you diabetes under control?Regards",
