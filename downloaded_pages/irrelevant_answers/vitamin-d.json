            "answer": "It is very possible since many of us with Medullary Sponge kidney disease also have low Vit D., However kidneys and thyroid are also closely connected.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had a blood test to check your kidney function?The way to tell if you have absorption issues if with a 24 hour urine and also one in which they test both urine and blood fasting then, after taking a supplement.\u00a0\u00a0This requires saving all the urine for several hours after the test supplement is given to you.Many had trouble absorbing synthetic Vit D.\u00a0\u00a0My compounding pharmacist recommended that I take Cod liver Oil with my Vit D since the best sources for Vit. D next to the sun are in fish and fish oils.\u00a0\u00a0With doing this we got my 14 to a 31 without the mega script doses of Vit d.. My kidneys are full of stones and there is a risk of increasing stones with a Vit D level that is too high too!Shelly",

    "question": "I take a multivitamin daily with 800 iu of Vitamin D.\u00a0\u00a0I also recently added 4 gummy vitamin D's that total an addition 1200.\u00a0\u00a0I have been hovering with a deficiancy of around 19... today I got the labs back and now I am down to 14.\u00a0\u00a0My dr. said she needed me to add 50,000 iu weekly and then after a month go to doing the 50,000 iu once a month in addition to my normal daily 2,000.I am frustrated.I have hashimotos.\u00a0\u00a0I was just increased from 88 to 100 mcg of Synthroid this week.\u00a0\u00a0I feel my best with TSH around 1.5, but I had gone up to TSH of 3 on the 88.Is it possible to have my problem with Vitamin D be not completely caused by my thryroid?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe malabsorbtion or kidney problems?\u00a0\u00a0I have had two tests show I have protien in urine.\u00a0\u00a0I have flank pain periodically.\u00a0\u00a0I have high blood pressure, diabetes, high triglycerides and low HDL, and swelling of ankles and hands.\u00a0\u00a0I often have stomach aches with multiple loose stools a day... so that's why I was also thinking possible malabsorbtion",
