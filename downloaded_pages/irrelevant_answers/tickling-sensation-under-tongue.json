            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Tingling sensation underneath tongue, jaw & neck could be suggestive of paresthesia that may occur due to either neuropathy (diabetes, vitamin deficiency & alcohol abuse) or any neurological disorder (such as multiple sclerosis, trigeminal neuralgia). If this persists I would suggest get your symptoms evaluated with the help of a neurologist. Hope this information proves helpful to you.",

            "answer": "Paresthesia can be either transient (short term) or chronic. In transient paresthesia, it can be just a pin or needle like feelings that may occur due to sudden loss of circulation especially in limbs due to temporary compression. Although chronic paresthesia (long term) in limbs/other body parts may lead to paralysis, if this persists for long and needs to be thoroughly evaluated. Hope this helps.",
