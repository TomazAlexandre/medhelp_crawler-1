            "answer": "I would stop the licorice for a while and see how you feel. It can raise your blood pressure higher than is good for you if you take it for more than 2 weeks at a time.1000mg of B5 might be a bit too much. Try a little less of this. B5 is THE adrenal stress vitamin.You are correct that allergies can disappear with adrenal support, if low adrenal hormones is the cause of the allergies. This was the case with my son. Unfortunately, he needed hydrocortisone to make this happen.",

This stuff works, not just to boost immunity, but, according to my sister, to correct faulty immune function. But it's so darned expensive!

            "answer": "Yeah, I think the licorice doasge is way too high for the long term.\u00a0\u00a0The mega doses of herbs/nutraceuticals can be hard on some people's digestion.\u00a0\u00a0Other good adrenal remedies are eleuthero root and medicinal mushrooms such as cordyceps.\u00a0\u00a0 I tend to get great results with a product called Envirelief, and you could probably combine it with some adrenal herbs for a better effect.But one thing you can do is stop your current regimen and see if your stomach pain goes away.\u00a0\u00a0If it does, start up your pills again and see if the pain comes back.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",
