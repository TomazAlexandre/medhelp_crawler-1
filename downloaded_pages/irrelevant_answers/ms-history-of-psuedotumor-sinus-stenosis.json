            "answer": "Have you been tested for fibromyalgia or CFS? You have a lot of the same symptoms as I do. A neuro can test the trigger points on your body that differentiate fibro from other autoimmune diseases. Fibro fog (memory problems) debilitating fatigue, sore muscles etc. are some of the symptoms. Is your diabetes under control? I don't know about the pseudotumor either, but it does sound like a neurological problem. Good luck with your appt. Let us know what you find out. Getting a diagnosis can be a long and frustrating journey. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry you would a little put out at not getting more answers.\u00a0\u00a0Most people on here live actual lives and aren't online that many times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Also when you have something as unusual as pseudotumor they feel uncomfortable trying to answer when they don't know anything about the condition.I'm sure you're frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0Having all the problems associated with increased intracranial pressure is enough already.\u00a0\u00a0I have to admit that I do not understand the significance of the stenosis of the distal transverse sinus.\u00a0\u00a0Was that felt to be a cause or a complication of the psuedotumor?\u00a0\u00a0Were you also evaluated for Chiari Malformation and for possible tethered cord?The additional things that you are having now certainly do sound like they are neurological.\u00a0\u00a0When the episodes occured suddenly and only lasted for minutes to hours, it does indeed sound like TIA's.\u00a0\u00a0Rather by definition, in MS when a new symptom occurs it lasts for a minimum of 24 hours.\u00a0\u00a0This is because the dysfunction result from damage to the structure of the nerve and not from a briefly reduced blood flow to the area.The urinary problem - called nocturnal frequency.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have problems with swelling of your legs or feet (or hands, for that matter)?\u00a0\u00a0Do you feel like you are able to completely empty your bladder or can you tell.\u00a0\u00a0 If you work at it can you always get some more urine out?\u00a0\u00a0I agree, it is imperative to keep neuropathy a bay, tight control of the diabetes is essential.\u00a0\u00a0But, as many of us can attest, it isn't fair but you can have more than one thing wrong with you.You deserve a complete rheumatologic and immunologic work up.\u00a0\u00a0The cold sores would not be part of MS.\u00a0\u00a0The other things you mentioned could, but could also be a part of poorly controlled diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Med interactions could be playing a role.\u00a0\u00a0Fibro and CFS are also in the running, LLWB is right.When was your last MRI of the brain?\u00a0\u00a0Both migraines and HBP can casue white matter lesions, but it should still be checked.\u00a0\u00a0Also nerve conduction studies might be useful in looking at why the limbs tingle and burn.\u00a0\u00a0The cold purple feet sound like peripheral artery disease.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have trouble with your legs and feet cramping?It really isn't fair to have all this going on and be only in your thirties.\u00a0\u00a0Let's pray that all the problems are due to problems you already have and not the addition of MS.\u00a0\u00a0One of the things to ensure that they test you for is Hughes Syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0This is basically a tendency to clot too easily.\u00a0\u00a0It is also called Anti-Phospholipid syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Because of teeny tiny clots the person acts very much like they have MS.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been on Plavix long enough to know if any of the symptoms are improved?Good luck, and I'm sorry again we weren't as prompt as you hoped.\u00a0\u00a0Quix",

    "question": "Hi,This has been going on for years, and next week I have an appointment with a new neuro.In 2003 I was diagnosed with Psuedotumor with accompanying high-grade stenosis of the distal transverse sinus. No MS lesions were found and my last mri was in November of 2004. I had an LP in January of 2004 which confirmed the pseudotumor. I thought that after the LP things were going well.In the last year I've developed a lot of symptoms, my family doctor told me 2 months ago he believed I had MS or possibly TIA's and referred me to a new neuro. I had a few episodes where something went wrong, I couldn't walk correctly and my right side was messed up. It went away after 15 minutes or so.I have excessive urination at night and I can get up 6 or 7 times a night, headaches, dizziness, mouth sores, memory loss, unable to find words when speaking, hands and feet extremely cold with feet becoming purple, double vision, numbness and tingling in hands and feet, sense of taste is off or it feels like what I have eaten is lodged in my throat, muscle spasms in back, burning pain in legs, arms feel like they weigh 1000 pounds each, and severe exhaustion.This is definately much different than when I had pseudotumor.\u00a0\u00a0I am 35 years old and have high blood pressure and diabetes. After the last episode my doctor put me on Plavix. I take meds for HBP, Diabetes, Acid Reflux, and high cholestrol.My appointment with the new neuro is next week and I am very nervous. Can anyone help?",
