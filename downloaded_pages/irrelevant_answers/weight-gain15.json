            "answer": "i agree with courtcoop,with my first pregnancy i gained 11 pounds in one month. the doctor was concerned and gave me a test for gestational diabetes. it turned out i was borderline, so i had to watch what i ate. in the end i gained about 59 pounds while pregnant.however, i was underweight (105) at that age (22) and later in life was a healthier (125-135) weight.everyone is different, so as long as physically you and baby are okay, BUT if you have concerns please speak to your doctor.",

            "answer": "i had gestational diabetes with my last three pregnancies but still they don't even test me til i have 7 weeks left in my pregnancy. i do know i've been eating a lot. no morning sickness and i've been to scared to exercise because of my previous losses. I've been under a lot of stress lately and havent been watching what i eat :( but still i didnt think i would pack on the weight this quick. the only thing that's different in this pregnancy is that i am on 100mg of progesterone once a day. last night was my last night on them since i'm now 3 months. i can see if that what caused it. I'm just looking at my eliptical machine and wishing i had the courage to get back on it. i loved that thing, now its collecting dust :(",

            "answer": "My understanding is that people's weight gain in pregnancy is highly variable, and that's mostly OK. But if you are concerned, please bring it up with your doctor. To be honest, I would be concerned if I were you - I'm at 18 wks and started out at a healthy weight, and I have only gained about 5 or 6 pounds so far.You might also want to ask about exercise. My doctor said that exercise was good for me as long as I wasn't bleeding (I had a bleeding episode caused by a CVS test, and had to stop exercising for about 10 days) and I kept my heart rate under about 140 BPM. So I just take it easy and make sure I keep track of my heart rate.",

            "answer": "thank you ladies for our advice. i was on medformin (forgot how to spell it) but still it was at 33 weeks pregnant with my last baby. i will call my Dr. and talk to her. Devo i also spotted once i started taking progesterone at 4 weeks and 6 days it stopped for a week until i had my CVS last thursday then of course it came back. so I am very scared to work out. everytime i have a dr. appointment and i tell her about the spotting she gives me an ultrasound and say everything is fine. starting today i've been watching what i put in my mouth and i will continue this for the next\u00a0\u00a07 month. my next dr. appointment is in 5 weeks. i hope to have loss weight or at least not have gained any. I'm not dieting but just not eating sugar stuff anymore.",
