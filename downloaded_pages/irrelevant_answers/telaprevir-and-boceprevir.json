            "answer": "Not a problem, what I'm thinking is that maybe the medical field is working more on a HepC vaccine than a cure for the infected.\u00a0\u00a0There haven't been any other PI's that have made it to Phase III.\u00a0\u00a0This is what your post says:The company's lead product candidate, dutogliptin (PHX1149), is a dipeptidyl-peptidase-4, or DPP-4, inhibitor in Phase 3 development as an oral, once-daily treatment for Type 2 diabetes. Phenomix has a collaboration with Forest Laboratories to develop and commercialize dutogliptin in North America. The company's second product candidate, PHX1766, is a protease inhibitor in Phase 1 clinical development for the treatment of hepatitis C virus, or HCV, infection.It's a good thing, but their drug is still only a Phase I hcv drug.\u00a0\u00a0The drug in Phase 3 developement is for the tx of Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully within a few years the study for a cure goes biotech or somewhere else as to only have 2 drugs in 20yrs. seems like it has fallen short.\u00a0\u00a0At least in my humble opinion.\u00a0\u00a0The link that I've left is somewhat of an artificial liver.\u00a0\u00a0We will all find out shortly, but I'm sure to think that tx is heading in the direction of cell manipulation.\u00a0\u00a0just thinking...http://www.vitaltherapies.com/",
