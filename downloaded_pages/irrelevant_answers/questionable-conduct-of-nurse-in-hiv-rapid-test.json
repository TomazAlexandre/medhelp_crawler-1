    "question": "Good day all,First and foremost, let me say thank you to the forum for what you guys are doing - you put a lot of us overly anxious characters at ease.Recently, I went for an HIV Rapid Test at a clinic.The nurse was using a lancet device which was shaped like a large pen, similar to the diabetes devices.She seemed to be struggling to get the device to work, as it looked like the lancet was jammed in there, so she (presumably) used another lancet and manually pricked my finger. The test was negative.The reason I am worried, is that there was a couple that tested before me, and I am scared that the same lancet was used on all of us. Our testing could not have been more than 5 - 10 minutes apart.I was on a phone call when she was preparing all the equipment, so I didnt get the time to look if the lancet was used or not - which is my concern.I can't distinctly remember if she managed to prick me with that first jammed lancet, or whether she just abandoned it and used another one, but just with her hands. It felt improper as the device indicates the depth to which the lancet penetrates.Do you think a used lancet could have been used, with regard to both the jammed and other lancet, and if so, could I be at risk for HIV infection due to having been pricked with either?Thank you very much.",
