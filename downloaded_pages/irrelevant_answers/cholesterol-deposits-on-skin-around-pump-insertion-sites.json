Maybe they are related to the procedure?? I would be really interested to know if you get know what they are.",

    "question": "My son, age 23 was diagnosed at 16. He uses an insulin pump and has noticed skin changes on the lateral sides of his abdomen where he inserts his sites. The areas are small and slightly lighter in color than his skin, they are flat or slightly raised, don't hurt and are not necessarily around the area of his current site. Two college health center doctors said they do not know what it is but they said it looks like the cholesterol deposits that people get around their eyes. Is it possible that cholesterol is depositing around his \"sites\" as blood leaks out with insertion and removal.Have you ever heard of this?",
