            "answer": "Thanks for the information. One thing that you should be aware of is that Seroquel with its ability to cause tardive dyskinesia (which is what I have) will eventually worsen the symptoms of Parkinsons'. However, Zofran which is being used to treat what they are identifying as tardive psychosis in me has shown in studies to be helpful on psychosis from Parkinsons'. And since its not a dopaminergic (standard antipsychotic, unlike glycine a glutaminergic agent which is what I am on for schizoaffective but those are still in Phase II FDA study) agent it will not create tardive dyskinesia or diabetes. Its already an approved medication for nausea from chemotherapy and can be used by any doctor off label for psychosis from Parkinsons's. You can look that up on the internet. I find it safe and effective and for someone with Parkinsons' it might be something to think about as it won't risk worsening the primary condition but has been shown to mitigate the psychotic symptoms of Parkinsons' when they emerge.",

    "question": "I am under study for the research criteria tardive psychosis. That is an aspect of tardive dyskinesia that can potentially cause its own set of psychotic changes. It is being treated with Zofran. Zofran is known in studies to help the psychosis associated with Parkinsons' Disease. It would be helpful to understand if people here who have experienced Parkinsons's Disease have had psychosis from it. I know it can commonly cause depression and in the latter stages dementia and thankfully tardive dyskinesia if checked will not progress but is severe in me and is potentially identified as causing psychosis similiar to that from Parkinsons. You could read through my journal entries (approved by my provider) for more information. If people have experienced psychosis from Parkinsons' I'd appreciate if they could let me know what it is like and if they were able to get it treated and with what. I understand many people with Parkinsons' have difficulties disclosing that aspect of their disability and if anyone could share the experience it could help me understand what I may be going through as tardive dyskinesia and Parkinsona's are clinically similar.",
