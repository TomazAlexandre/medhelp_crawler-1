            "answer": "If you believe your are reacting badly to Lantus (or any other medications) you should ask your physician for an alternative, at least to verify it is the medication and not some other factor that is causing the problem. Lantus is popular for it's 24 hour action, but so is Levemir (Novo Nordisk). NPH insulin can also be used for long acting insulin, though two injections may be needed to get the 24 hour coverage. Do not be afraid to ask your physician to work with you to determine if the Lantus is the cause, and get you on an alternative medication if you feel it is the right solution for you. It is your diabetes and your life.Larry",
