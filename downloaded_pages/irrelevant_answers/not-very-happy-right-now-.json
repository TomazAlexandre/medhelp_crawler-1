I hope you have lots of support during RECOVERY from your surgery, though!I am shocked that your Dr would suggest you not gain any more weight. I have read that when you are on the underweight side (and at 5,10, your BMI would have been LOW) 35-45 is the norm.I was average weight with my first, gained 37 pounds, and my Dr told me that was just lovely (although I can't say I felt lovely!:). Continue to eat healthy, and your body will gain what it needs to support your baby.Would it be fair to say that your Dr is a little older? Seems pretty \"old school\" to me. I think my Mom was told to gain 15 pounds or something foolish. HA!",

She said it was not too terribly high and should be managed fine with diet. No Sweets! O my lord! The thing that bothers me the most is having to ***** my finger 4 times a day. Ouch! I guess it could be worse. Everything else looked great! So if I can just get through the next 10 or 11 weeks. Danielle",
