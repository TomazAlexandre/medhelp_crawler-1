            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you have missed your periods, then go for a blood pregnancy test for confirmation. This is not expensive and yet reliable.If pregnancy is ruled out, then anemia, PCOD, diabetes and hypothyroidism along with low/high BP could be the cause. Stress is another major factor. Get this evaluated and you should be fine. Take care!",
