            "answer": "My triglycerides used to be elevated, not that high, but over normal. I beleive it was close to 200. What lowered mine was taking fish oil liquid. The \"Carlson\" Fish oil is the best and it is the ONLY thing that lowers it. I take it twice a day, morning and night, a tablespoon, I would not be without it. My triglycerides are now 72.\u00a0\u00a0A person should start noticing a difference in about 3 to 6 months.Hope this helps.Susie",

            "answer": "B_loeMy triglycerides have been over 2000. I have a genetic disorder that is called hyperlipidemia and/or hypertriglyceridemia. Other than having these bad genes, smoking, drinking alcohol and lack of exercise and a heart healthy diet causes triglyceride levels to rise.Triglyceride levels from 1000 to 1500 can cause pancreatitis, per my doctor. My grandmother died from this. I have managed to lower them mainly through stopping all alcohol, which at the time the 2000 tri's were measured, I did not drink any alcohol, and diet.There is a very potent medicine in the drug class known as fenofibrates, named Tricor that was created to specifically reduce triglycerides. It works great, but carries the same warnings as statins. Also, Tricor should not be taken with statins but sometimes is in very extreme cases of total high cholesterol and triglycerides. My total cholesterol at the time was 486.I feel the combination of medicines left me with permanent peripheral neuropathy (PN) in my extremities, especially in my legs and feet. I have to take a medicine, neurontin, for the PN.Hope this helps,Jack",

            "answer": "I have been on fenofibrate (generic Tricor) for a few years. My triglycerides are 200 still, my LDL is high 180s I think. My HDL is 38 they like them in 40s. I recently went to the ER 3x in that many months with pain in my chest. I thought heart attack. Turns out I have gallstones. I did research Tricor can cause gallstones. It turns out they are made of cholesterol. My blood pressure med Nadolol (generic Corgard) raises Triglycerides and lowers good cholesterol! Ask for Lovaza it is omega 3. I take 2grams twice a day. Thats 2000mg twice a day. It raises HDL Happy cholesterol. It lowers LDL Lowsey cholesterol, and Triglycerides.",
