            "answer": "Sorry you're going through this. Get in touch with your state services (if in the US) and see what they can do to help you with food, etc. You'll eventually need to file for child support. If you're religious, there's also a lot of churches that will help you out. Good luck.",

            "answer": "I'm sorry your going thru this especially while pregnant. My advice it's probably the best thing he could have done for you. Good riddens, I know it's hard to say or think but your babies need you NOT HIM. He's an able body adult who can take care if himself but your babies cannot do the same. Just like above mention try getting help from your state services, like WIC, Snap program. They'll even help you file for child support. I been through something similar and I was emotionally shut down for nearly a year but 1 thing that made me happy and brought me back to life were my 2 little innocent ones.",

    "question": "Hi, i just need some advice. I'm 29 weeks and just got diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Last friday i caught boyfriend cheating, and since then he has disappeared leaving me in a tough situation. We also have a two year old together. He left us with no money, no food, no car and nobody has heard from him. His friends and family are helping but my daughter cries for her daddy and i just don't know what to do. Besides the fact that he is cheating, he is drinking and using drugs. Any advice?",
