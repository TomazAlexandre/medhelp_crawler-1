            "answer": "Hi Smiley2000Thank you for your reply. Hubby had 5 tubes of blood taken to check out if there was a physical cause. I think probably blood gasses was one of them. However when he had his bloods taken his lips weren't blue so not sure if that would have made a difference... Thank you. I have suggested he visits the GP again, but he is so disheartened at being fobbed off all the time, that he is now refusing. I will keep at him though.",
