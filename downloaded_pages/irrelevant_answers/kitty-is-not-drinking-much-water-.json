            "answer": "Yes, she's always been a big water drinker, even as a kitten.\u00a0\u00a0 And we do feed her dry food - she seems to really like it.\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't necessarily drink alot at any one time;\u00a0\u00a0we also keep a small bowl upstairs and one downstairs, and when she walks past the bowl, she stops for a few sips.Since I change out her water bowls, my husband gets litter box duty.\u00a0\u00a0If I had to guess, I'd say she uses it 2 or 3 times a day, but I'll check with my husband.\u00a0\u00a0He usually cleans it every night.I've read on another cat forum that some would never consider feeding their cat dry food, but our vet indicated that as long as it's a decent brand and not \"junk\" kitty food, it's fine.\u00a0\u00a0I was relieved, because she seems to prefer dry over wet.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Other than excessive drinking, what are some signs of diabetes in cats?Thanks!Sandy \u2666",

            "answer": "hi...I wouldnt be concerned if she's peeing only the 2-3x per day esp since she is eating dry food like Jade said this will make kitty's more thirsty just b/c the food is so dehydrated. I will send you a site, I don't agree with your Vet at all abt ok to feed dry food.read the following site..and what this very knowledgeable Vet has to say abt dry food diets and all the health problems associated with it..you can also click on the right hand side under FELINE HEALTH there is the heading DIABETES and you can read up on that too.p.s. you don't have to go the route of raw diets as this Vet recommends, she does say that any canned food is much better than even the 'best' dry food..http://www.catinfo.org/",
