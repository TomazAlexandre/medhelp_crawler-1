            "answer": "There are ways to do it, i think its too late now as well but did you know there is always transportation available if you are pregnant through your insurance if you have insurance which im positive you do because your pregnant lol just call your maternity nurse or your insurance company itself and ask how to be provided with rides. They may not let your husband go but your other children probably they allow mine and im in the same situation my husband works alll the time so i have to get myself to all my appointments which in the beginning meant walking with my 4 yr old and we live in washington so its always raining. For furture reference if you have more children check witb your insurance because ive never heard of any insurance that doesnt provide some sort of transportation.",
