            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Unexplained aches and pains with rashes coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "Ok sorry first of all for the long post I am just looking for answers cause I am really frustrated right now. It all started three weeks ago with right leg pain,\u00a0\u00a0I have been having right side pain and some pain in the left side and chest pain, the right leg pain is in the groin, calf and occasionally thigh area, diarrhea, jaw pain, chills, hands feel cold and sweaty,\u00a0\u00a0and also some left and right hip pain all this comes and goes.\u00a0\u00a0I've had both legs ultrasounded and were negative for clots, i've had about 6 D Dimer Tests which were all normal, 4 chest xrays all normal, a CT Scan of my belly which showed nothing but a 2cm cyst on the outside of my kidney, had my thyroid tested which also came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the ER today\u00a0\u00a0cause I had a real bad panic attack while there the ER doctor looked up my ultrasound of my gallbladder which my regular doctor had ordered cause she thought the pain in my side was related to my gallbladder, but the ER doctor said it looked ok still waiting to hear from my regular doctor, he also checked my liver that came out fine and my heart is fine cause they have done EKGs and heart enzyme blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0Any idea what could be wrong?\u00a0\u00a0I do have anxiety but that couldn't cause everything i'm experiencing could it?",
