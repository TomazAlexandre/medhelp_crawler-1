    "question": "Hello, I'm a 28 year old male. Over the past couple years my health has been steadily deteriorating.Physical Issues:- Weight gain. 1-2 years gained 40lbs. (Now closing in on 295lbs)- Unable to lose weight. Cut calories, ate better food, worked out with a trainer 4-5 days a week, 2.5 hours a day for a month and lost 2lbs. Muscle gain did not account for the lack of weight loss.- knee pain (for 4-5 years). X-rays came back negative.- legs are constantly overheated, and warm to the touch.- exhaustion, all the time. To the point where it affects my life.- no interest in anything due to always being tired.- caffeine has no effect. Never drank coffee in my life, but started drinking black coffee and had no effect.- constantly feeling 'I can't', whenever something comes up.Doctors suggestions:-Doctor treated this as depression. I went on Celexa for 5 months and all that did was make things worse. Increased weight gain, more tired, more emotional, more depressed.- I also saw a psychologist for about 10 sessions, but this was not very effective as I didn't have any specific trauma events.- blood work and urine came back normal. No thyroid issues, no diabetes, nothing.I keep trying to get healthy, but I can't shake this 'cloudy' feeling and exhaustion all the time.I don't know if anyone can think of what this could be? I know I need to get more active, but like I said above my body and mind keep telling me 'I can't'...and no amount of caffeine helps.",
