            "answer": "Hello fellow doxie lover!I haven't found a dachshund forum yet but I'm sure that a server couldn't handle all of us posting how cute they are all the time!\u00a0\u00a0:-)My picture is of my best buddy, Buster, who died of diabetes in December.\u00a0\u00a0His life-long companion, Sienna, is snoring on the bed right now.\u00a0\u00a0:-)\u00a0\u00a0She had 7 benign tumors removed 2 1/2 weeks ago and looks like something out of a horror movie (but I love her).\u00a0\u00a0On my profile, on my last journal entry, is my new baby, Bailey.\u00a0\u00a0He's the most beautiful little monster ever.Oh, and I have a rescued Beagle, Jovi, to balance it all out.\u00a0\u00a0We found her on the side of the road, hit by a car and nearly starved to death last summer.\u00a0\u00a0She's missing a tail but is fat and sassy now (and one of my constant shadows).I take the baby, Bailey, to work with me every day.\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, I can't even go to the bathroom without him (or he cries - *loudly*).\u00a0\u00a0I've always said that dachshunds are giant dogs in little bodies.\u00a0\u00a0Have to love the dachshunds.I added you to my friend list.\u00a0\u00a0Send me a message through there anytime.Best of everything with your Hep C - I'm going through hell with my thyroid cancer (and all the side effects from the treatment) and my dachshunds have been there for me always!I need to push my local city council.\u00a0\u00a0I'm limited to three dogs here and there are 6 dachshunds in the local shelters.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could adopt them all!!\u00a0\u00a0I remember that Sprint PCS add with the \"100 Head of Dachshund\" and that's my dream.\u00a0\u00a0:-)Hang in there Bonnie!Utah",

    "question": "Hi utahmomma I just can not resist another doxie lover and I can tell you love yours. My name is Bonnie and am lola57 on here I found this website by researching my hepatitis c lots of nice people. I have 2 dacshunds a boy Oscar 7 and a girl Shelby 2 1/2 Oscar is very sweet and always playing and very much in love with Shelby even tho both are fixed he is always kissing her face lol and Shelby well she thinks she is the boss lol. My dachshunds sleep with me heck can not even go to the restroom without company sure you know what I mean. My dogs are like therapy when I am sick with my hepitis they are alot of comfort for me, can talk to them when I can't talk to anyone else sound crazy huh. By way look at my profile and Shelby is on the left and Oscar on the right he is not mean he is barking at my husband they don't like anyone around me except my kids. Well anyone hello and nice to meet you is there a cacshund forum anywhere?Bonnie",
