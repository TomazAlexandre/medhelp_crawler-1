I have had my left hip replaced twice and I'm getting ready to replace the replacement that was put in incorrectly ( it's loose and MOVING all over the place :( ) in September. I also have Osteoarthritis, DDD, etc.I hope that your knee and hip implants are doing well. I know how GREAT it is when they are GREAT and how bad it is when they DON'T work.I lost my husband to Diabetes and I KNOW how DEBILITATING that disease is. I'm so sorry that you are haviing to battle it!!REMEMBER that I'm NO Doctor, HOWEVER, I have a feeling that what you are going thru at night may VERY well have to do with you Diabetes as My Husband dealt with this each day and night!! It was caused by his Diabetic Neuropathy. It affected the nerve endings in his body and he felt like he had BUGS crawling all over him at times.Have you checked with you Dr.'s about this at all?\u00a0\u00a0I REALLY feel that it would be WELL worth looking into for you.I want to Welcome you and let you know how GLAD we are that you are here ONE MORE TIME!!!PLease let us know what you find out and keep us updated......Sherry",

            "answer": "Thanks for the welcome, Sherry, and thanks for the info about Diabetic Neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I had seen something on line about that aspect of diabetes, but my diabetes is new for me, and I'm just learning a few things about it.\u00a0\u00a0Think I will work to find a specialist, instead of relying on my primary care physician.Good luck with your next hip replacement.\u00a0\u00a0I have been very lucky with both my hip and knee replacements.\u00a0\u00a0First, I had an excellent surgeon, one of the best at New England Baptist Hospital, which is noted for its orthopedic surgery and rehab departments.\u00a0\u00a0Second, my surgeron wasvery concerned that I got a lot of very good physical therapy.He's a good enough physician to know that his surgery is only really part of the process, and that intensive physical therapy helps to make him look like a much better surgeon in the long run!\u00a0\u00a0So, I was truly blessed.Thanks for the info....Pandama",

            "answer": "Hi Pandama,Welcome to the Pain Management Forum. I am glad that you found us but sorry to hear about your mysterious pain.Please forgive my tardy response. I apologize but have had some increased pain of late that has required more rest.I think that nerve pain or in your case diabetic neuropathy is a good possibility as Sherry suggested. A good endocrinologist can help you with a diagnosis. Generally neuropathy does not occur until after a number of years following the onset of the disease. If it is well controlled you decrease the chances of developing neuropathy as well as decreasing the severity.Circulatory issues can also account for the type of pain that you describe. You might also want to consult with a gerontologist. Gerontology is the study of the aging processes and individuals as they grow from middle age through later life. It includes the study of health and disease in later life. These physicians are considered the best at diagnosing a set of symptoms and detecting disease conditions in older adults.I encourage you to seek our a diagnosis. I agree with you that it may be time to at least obtain a second opinion. Your current PMP may very well be a good one but just missing something or not thoroughly investigating your symptoms. You deserve more than an \"I don't know.\"I look forward to your updates. I too hope that you will become active in our community. Our members are supportive and informational. I am sure that you will fit right in with them.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep us posted and best of luck to you.Take Care,~Tuck",
