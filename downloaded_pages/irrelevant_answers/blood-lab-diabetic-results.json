            "answer": "Hello,Your results are very slightly high, however they would not get you diagnosed with diabetes or even prediabetes by most in the medical profession.I do think it would be best that you consider yourself at risk of diabetes, and take the appropriate lifestyle steps to be as healthy as possible and hopefully things will stay stable long-term.What to do:-1. if you are overweight, work hard at getting to 'ideal' weight2. Daily exercise at least 30 minutes on all or most days3. Avoid sugars and sweets, particularly softdrinks and sweets.4. Avoid high fructose corn syrup.\u00a0\u00a0This means reading labels as HFCS is in many many processed foods.5. Eat a lower carb diet (cut down on grains etc), with most carbs coming from non-starchy veges, nuts, cheeses, unsweetened regular fat dairy, etc.6. Do get your Hba1c monitored every 6 months or so, so you can see how you are doing.If at the next monitoring your numbers are still the same or higher, then I would recommend you get a blood sugar meter and do some testing at home to see what foods work for your and don't raise your blood sugar.Hope this helps.",

I am new to this site and you were the first to respond to me :)",
