Coming from a computer programming background, I can speculate on how these trackers work on the back-end and it seems to me like it would be easy enough to just change the labels on the back end that are used for calculations to just be something generic like Option1, Option2, etc, and then let the users create their own labels that mean something to them.Like one person said, for them, just getting out of the house would be considered exercise (same for me, with my constant pain), but for others, a 50 mile bike ride would be something they would like to record.Thanks!",

We wanted to let you know that all these trackers are on our list of to-do's and we're trying to get to them as quickly as possible. We thank you all for your suggestions. If you'd like to have these trackers added, please add a comment to this post rather than creating a new thread. We'll let you know when the new trackers are available. Thanks!-MedHelp",
