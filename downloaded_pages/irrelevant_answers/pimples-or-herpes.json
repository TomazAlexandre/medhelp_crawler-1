    "question": "just general questions:do herpes present itself as normal pimples that occur overnight on the vulva area and ooze pus the next day or the herpes lesions present itself as a red bump before progressing to water/pus filled bumps?what does \"crust over\" - a scab forming or a crystal like crust?had a few bumps on my vulva area where hair is when i woke up in the morning and they ooze pus immediately. plus I was getting my period soon and started exercising so not sure if its hormones and sweat. They looked like pimples and ooze pus when squeezed. Not pain and some healed by the next day. Others just continued oozing pus and healed later.",
