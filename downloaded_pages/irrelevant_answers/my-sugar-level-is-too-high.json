            "answer": "I'M not sure..You didn't say if you were a Diabetic??? On a daily basis over 250 is not good. If you are Diabetic, eat less sugar, less carbs and more vegs, whole wheat breads, whole wheat pasta, exercise should lower your blood sugars,. However if you are like me on Insulin and constantly stressed THAT raises your blood sugars so find ways to help you relax and calm the mind and body. Lots depends on what you are eating??? Look up\u00a0\u00a0www.diabetes.org and you can learn allot on health, foods to eat, tracking your blood sugars and ways to lower stress etc.. Good luck.",
