Rarely will we every set a post surgery goal of -7.00 refractive error especially if the other eye that is being \"matched\" does not see normally.As a generalization if you like reading without glasses then most surgeons would likely set the \"good\" eye at -2.75\u00a0\u00a0+/- 0.25 diopters and do lasik on bad eye or IOL exchange.JCH MD",

    "question": "I had cataract surgery in my left eye some thirty years ago when I was 35 (Reason for such early cataract is not known \u2013 I do not have diabetes). No lens was implanted. Later on some 10 years ago, I had a lens implant but the job was botched (Wrong lens was implanted). In the same eye, macula is also damaged perhaps because of some childhood injury. I also use eye drops for glaucoma in both eyes. Now I need to have cataract surgery in my right eye. My doctor says that he will need to put a weak lens in this eye so as to balance it with the left eye. It means that my good eye will also be -7. My left eye is -10. For some reason he did not suggest improving the left eye\u2019s sight through piggyback lens or Lasik, at least to correct for the wrong implant, and, at that time I did not know about these options. I will certainly ask him about these options before proceeding with any surgery on my right eye. Regardless, I feel quite uncomfortable about the weakening of the good eye. Is my concern legitimate or am I overreacting?Any advice would be most helpful.",
