            "answer": "Hi,While I definitely agree that eating that much sugar is a bad idea, you cannot really \"make yourself diabetic\" by eating sugar in and of itself. If you have normal glucose metabolism, your blood sugar will not become high even if you eat the whole bag of sugar. HOWEVER, if this habit causes you to gain weight, this can change the way you handle glucose and later lead to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest a few things:1)Get a glucose meter and check your blood sugar upon waking in the morning and 1-2 hours after you eat all that sugar, or whenever you have those sweats and flushes. If the levels are very high( above 140) or low(below 50) please see your doctor for a further evaluation.2) Perhaps you could speak with your doctor anyway even if your sugar levels are normal.\u00a0\u00a0He/she should be able to help you with treating your anxiety that causes this \"obsession\" with eating sugar.3) have a general check up anyway to make sure you are\u00a0\u00a0not missing some mineral/vitamins in your system that may be the cause of these cravings.Take care.",
