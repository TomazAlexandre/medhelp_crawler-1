            "answer": "It seems to me that you are having what is called \u201cCardiac syndrome X\u201d. It affects women more then men and although there\u2019s no known cause, it\u2019s believed that it is associated with hormones. Others suggest its relation to microvascular angiopathies. Whatever the cause, it\u2019s said that obesity, diabetes, hypertension and dyslipidemia increase the risk of this syndrome.Typically, the patient complain from anginal pain, has positive stress ECG despite the normal coronary angiogram. Sometimes, it is associated with Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon (bluish discolouration of the fingers on exposure to cold) and migraine. However, its diagnosis is made by ruling out Prinzmetal\u2019s (variant) angina and esophageal spasm.It\u2019s better to discuss with your cardiologist the possible treatment. There\u2019s no real cure, however some have responded to nitrates, calcium channel blockers, beta blockers, aminophylline or estrogen.I hope that you\u2019ll feel better soon. Let us hear from you.",

    "question": "I've had 4 stents placed and 1 angioplasty on one of the stents about 4 months later.\u00a0\u00a0It has been over a year since the last procedure, but I continue to have chest pain.\u00a0\u00a0I had 2 more angiograms that were clear.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr. has chalked it up to anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I have difficuly accepting that diagnosis because I don't have panic attacks or sharp pains in the chest.\u00a0\u00a0This is discomfort and is there at least every other day. It is keeping me from doing things, like excersise or going places etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0This is a different pain than what I had before the stents.Any answers????",
