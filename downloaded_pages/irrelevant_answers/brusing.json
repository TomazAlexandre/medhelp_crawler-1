            "answer": "He should see an Endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in diabetes care and treatment. His lifestyle and medication has to be closely scrutinized and changed if need be. Do not depend on an ordinary doctor for further care.This is what I found on the iNet; There are two occasions when bruises might appear if diabetes is the source. The first condition is named acanthosis nigricans. With this condition, our skin might exhibit black or brown discoloration in the folds or creases of our body. This is usually a situation something that occurs on the neck and inside the armpits. This happens because insulin has suffused in the skin, and it is often considered to be a symptom of Type II diabetes.The other condition that may affect you is the fact that normal healing times can be diminished in people who have diabetes. HTH. Good luck.",
