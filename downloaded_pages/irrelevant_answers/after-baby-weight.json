            "answer": "Try doing the diabetes/gestational diabetes diet...the basics... limit carbs intake to 30g per meal, cut as much sugars as possible (I drank fruit juices, soda, Starbucks coffee loaded with sugar, ate ice cream and candy-- and eliminated 95%), and they have a lot of awesome recipes on pinterest... I was told I have GD and was forced to change my eating habits to diabetic eating habits and have lost weight... I haven't gained anything this pregnancy and I'm 36 weeks pregnant... I'm actually down 6 lbs from pre-pregnancy weight... walking also helps (and it helps prepare your body and pelvis for labor and delivery)",
