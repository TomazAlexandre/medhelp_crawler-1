            "answer": "Since you have a family history of diabetes, you should have a blood test done.\u00a0\u00a0You could have this done at your doctor's office or since November is Diabetes Awareness Month, you may be able to find an organization doing diabetes screenings in your area.\u00a0\u00a0Fasting blood sugar over 126 mg/dl would be considered diabetes and fasting blood sugar between 100 and 126 mg/dl would be considered pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Drowsiness and lethargy are symptoms of diabetes but you don't mention having the most common symptoms which are frequent urination, extreme hunger and thirst and sudden weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0At any rate, with a history of diabetes, it would probably be a good idea to periodically have your blood sugar checked.\u00a0\u00a0If someone in your family has a blood sugar monitor, you could even use that.Have a wonderful weekend.",

            "answer": "Your inability to concentrate could easily be a symptom of hypoglycemia, for your description of brain being made of teflon is a pretty good description of the low blood sugar brain dump. If you do go to your doctor for a blood test or even if you do one with a diabetic relative's home kit, try to pick a time when you are feeling the worst. If hypoglycemic, the low blood sugar will come and go, so do the test when feeling this lack of concentration. If blood sugar is UNDER 100, as low as 80, then this could affect concentration in a major physical way. It also affects memory, and a hypoglycemic taking a test is a recipe for disaster. When sugar levels are low you will not be able to remember information that you truly know without a doubt when feeling normal. The true test for hypoglycemia is a glucose tolerance test at a doctor's office, but a finger ***** at a relative's house when feeling bad could give you an idea of whether you are low or high. That could help a doctor narrow down what test to run with labwork. Best of luck -- I am writing this while a tad hypoglycemic and am sympathetic if that is what is happening to you. Brain mush is not fun... I was reading when my sugar levels dropped and found myself reading the same paragraph over and over. Hate it when that happens. Do let us know, for we can give you all sorts of first-hand info if you find blood sugar levels are high or low.",

            "answer": "Thank you for all your help!As far as the most common symptoms mentioned I do find myself thirsty a lot of the time. I have often described my thirst as exponential (I'm an engineering student) but the thing is I don't usually quench my thirst so I don't go to the bathroom \"frequently\". I don't notice being any more hungry than usual, and I haven't recently lost weight, but then again that could be because of my history.I know exactly what you mean when you say that you'll read a paragraph over and over, I do it all the time.I plan on speaking with my pediatrician on Monday and asking him about getting blood work done.Thanks again for such quick responses. It's comforting to know that there are others that think there might be something more to the \"college student that's having trouble\".- ibchaka",

            "answer": "Hey everyone!So I called my doctor and talked to him about my symptoms possibly being diabetes. He really doesn't think that diabetes is the case because of the lack of frequent urination. He said that I would be having to get up in the middle of the night at least once to either drink or go to the bathroom, which I don't.I believe that he was talking strictly Type 1, because I guess I am too young for Type 2?He said that he is going to continue working with me to figure out what is going on. (He says that even though I don't have the typical symptoms of depression, that he thinks it might be that.) Thank you guys for all your help!- ibchaka",

    "question": "Hey everyone!Let me tell you a little about me and my history so hopefully I can have you understand my situation.I am a 19 year old college sophomore. I have always been a really good student up until college, when my grades dropped. At first I thought it was just the change of starting college, but this year it has become worse and more obvious that it is due to a lack of ability to focus and keep my attention on things. Even when I sit down and try my hardest to read and concentrate, it's like my brain is made of teflon.For about a year now I have noticed that my limbs fall asleep really easily. I can't sit crosslegged, on my knees, or even on the floor with my legs straight out. When I sit like that, within a few minutes my legs start to tingle, like they are going to fall asleep.I am always tired. At first I thought it was because I wasn't getting enough sleep, but with an adequate amount of sleep I still fall asleep in my classes and other times throughout the day.I don't know if this next thing could relate, but it might. I have recently (the past 6 months) recovered from anorexia. I was not the type that got super thin, but I did restrict my eating for a period of almost two years. (I am currently 5'8\" and 185lbs.)I have a family history of diabetes. Both my grandmothers have/had it, and I know at least one uncle that has it. My family also has a history of heart disease.My spanish told me about a student she had that had the same concentration problem and after being tested, found out she had diabetes.Thanks for all your help!ibchaka",
