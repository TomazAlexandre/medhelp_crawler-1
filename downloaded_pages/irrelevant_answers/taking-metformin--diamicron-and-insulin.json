I am continuing to take the meds and my insulin; however, the doctor only started me off at 5 units, twice a day, which I believe is very minimal. I am going to contact his office today to give them my readings and see where we go from here. Thank you for your support.",

Resting sugar levels over 25.Doctor just started me on insulin to keep me out of emergency and I am still taking my metformin and diamicron, but not sure if I should be taking all. It's Xmas Eve and no one to turn to, but I am very light-headed and not sure about going to sleep. If I fall asleep I hope I wake up.",
