            "answer": "Hi Dr MathurI have hypertension that is controlled by Toprol XL, and my last A1C was a 5.8 . CBC showed only very slightly elevated white count, thyroid and B12 was fine. AMI Panel was fine, Lipid panel was fine. CT scan of my head without contrast showed a sinus infection which accounts for the pressure no evidence of a mass, ventricles are the right size, shape. Oh, my BP at my last exam was 100/67 but it averages at 120/75. My DR prescribed me an antibiotic for the infection, and Antivert for the dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0My DR doubts that it is MS as well, however she can not explain why I still have the vibrations and spasms along with an elevated heart rate and BP when these attacks hit. She suggested I go to a Neurologist. Would a TIA show up on a CT?",
