            "answer": "If she does have an ulcer, she needs to stay away from acidic foods when it flares.\u00a0\u00a0This will make it burn worse, some people have the same reaction to spicy foods.\u00a0\u00a0If she is under a lot of stress, it will cause an ulcer to flare.\u00a0\u00a0I have one and have the same feeling of intense heartburn, and if it gets really bad, I do feel nauseas.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking milk usually helps, because it coats the lining of your stomach so that the burning calms down.\u00a0\u00a0It's kind of like a band-aid for the inside of your stomach lining.\u00a0\u00a0I heard about this old wives tale of drinking milk, and thought I would try it, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't, but its worth a shot.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of chronic nausea is acidity. Let your mother take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Possibility of H pylori infection, hiatal hernia and gastric reflux should be looked into. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.Hope this helps. Take care!",
