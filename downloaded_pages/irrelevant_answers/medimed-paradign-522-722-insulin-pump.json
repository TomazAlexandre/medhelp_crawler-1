    "question": "Hi,My son who is 9 years old has just been diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes (formerly known as Juvenile diabetes). He has been using the insulin pens up until now but now I have discovered the existence of the new MiniMed Paradigm insulin pumps (522, 722 or other models). I am interested in how much these pumps cost (including all the accesories one needs). We are in Australia so if anyone also knew the name of a distributor or distributors for these devices, it would be good. I appreciate any comments or news on the above. Thanks.Peter.",
