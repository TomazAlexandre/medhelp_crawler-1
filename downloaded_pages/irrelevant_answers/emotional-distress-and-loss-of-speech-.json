            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Delayed speech with heaviness and numbness in the tongue can all lead to slurred speech or dysarthria. Dysarthria refers to slow and distorted speech, such as slurring. It results from the inability to control or coordinate the muscles used in speaking. It could be caused due to traumatic head injury, stroke, bell\u2019s palsy, degenerative diseases of the brain etc.I think in your mother\u2019s case it could most probably be stroke or bell\u2019s palsy. Stroke can occur due to a number of causes like diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension. Emotional factors can play a role in hypertension and diabetes. Bell\u2019s palsy occurrence is not related to anything in particular. It is idiopathic in occurrence.I would suggest that you visit a neurologist for confirmation of diagnosis with physical examination and investigations.Best.",
