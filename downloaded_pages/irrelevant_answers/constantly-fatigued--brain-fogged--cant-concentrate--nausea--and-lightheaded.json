            "answer": "I cannot take anti depressants either I have to take a nerve pill which helps and I can't feel any effects but it helps calm me inside.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest 2 cups of Epsom Salt added to your bath water this will help you to relax and also get some Magnesium in your system. It sounds as if your blood pressure is causing the facial flushing.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had this checked?\u00a0\u00a0I can only suggest you try to occupy yourself with things that relax you, let your friends and family give you some support, get as much sleep as you can and let your body rejuvenate and drink plenty of water.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to you:)",

            "answer": "Magnesium supplements and Epsom Salt baths are good.You should get blood work to check your Vitamin D and Vitamin B12.D levels should be 60/80ng/mL to be optimal for health. Below 50 is bad.B12 should be above 500...closer to 800 is better.Those above, as well as magnesium, will cause brain fog, anxiety, headaches, vision problems, dizziness...etc if your low normal or deficient.",

            "answer": "The key things here seem to be, one, you had a common and bad reaction to Prozac.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of people have.\u00a0\u00a0While because this is the only ssri that stays in your system a long time, that actually makes it safer to take and to stop taking, but anyone can have a bad reaction when playing around with brain neurotransmitters.\u00a0\u00a0So it's not that it's still in your system, it's that your brain has been disrupted and is trying to get back to normal.\u00a0\u00a0This should happen soon, as you weren't on it very long.\u00a0\u00a0The second thing, however, is the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your anxiety and high blood pressure could indicate you have not moved to a diet more suitable for a person with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugar problems can cause every one of the symptoms you're having, including high blood pressure, and you probably don't actually need that drug -- you could probably reach the same result, though more slowly, by learning how to eat better, which every diabetic needs to do religiously or everything goes haywire.\u00a0\u00a0Since we can't know, and you can't know, which parts of your diet are out of whack and making your diabetes worse, you might consult a holistic nutritionist to get some help if you can afford it.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, the person who recommended magnesium, if it works, might in itself solve your high blood pressure problem.\u00a0\u00a0There are also herbs that can do this, particularly hawthorn combinations.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible the medication you're on is also making you worse, as all meds can be a problem.\u00a0\u00a0There might be a lot you can do short of a bunch of meds, which doctors are so quick to recommend as they know nothing about anything else usually, that might help to get you back in balance.\u00a0\u00a0Again, if you can afford it, you might try to find a doctor who practices complementary or integrated medicine, who knows both plant medicine, dietary medicine, and allopathic medicine to handle a very complex problem that affects almost all of your bodily systems.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "I take Magnesium Oxide 400 one tablet in the morning and one at night.\u00a0\u00a0I have low magnesium though.\u00a0\u00a0The magnesium only has one side effect if too much mg for you then you will have loose bowel movements.\u00a0\u00a0Start out on a small mg amount and see how you do.\u00a0\u00a0I myself wish that I would have known about it years ago it has helped me a lot.\u00a0\u00a0Stress causes you to lose Magnesium into your bloodstream and not all people who have blood work show low magnesium because only one percent is in your blood it will only show up if your extremely low.\u00a0\u00a0I can't answer whether or not its the anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I took a group therapy class and they had us to keep a journal of our symptoms, surroundings, time of day, smells.\u00a0\u00a0Its hard to believe that certain cologne or perfumes can bring on a panic attack but it sure enough can.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds out there a bit I know I didn't believe it either until I looked back through my journal.\u00a0\u00a0I'm here for you if you need me.\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety and panic attacks and rapid heart beats are no fun and tends to control your life and will if you let it.\u00a0\u00a0Been there done that.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and try to think positive.\u00a0\u00a0Stay strong:)",

            "answer": "They symptoms you describe are of someone in the throes of pretty severe ongoing anxiety. Take it from me, I've been there! I think taking and then stopping the Prozac, followed by the onset of the symptoms you describe, was probably a coincidence. If you can overcome the anxiety, the symptoms will lessen. That's what happened to me. I hope for your sake they go away completely and you'll be 100% back to normal, but try not to be too disappointed if the anxiety and symptoms pay a return visit from time to time. Best advice I can give you to overcome your anxiety: don't fight it, but instead simply recognize it and just \"ride the wave.\" Don't hyper focus on and fret over the symptoms. Occupy your mind with the world and people around you, rather than what's going on in your head and body. I hope that helps!",

    "question": "Hello all!So to start off, I'm a 27 year old female who is also a type 1 diabetic. For about the past 10 months I have been experiencing extreme anxiety and panic attacks. I've tried numerous medications to try to help with my anxiety, but meds just haven't agreed with me. The side effects have been horrible. I was prescribed Prozac about 2 months ago. I was in it for 3 weeks and decided to get off of it because it made me extremely depressed, very confused, increased anxiety, angry, and visual disturbances. Now ever since I stopped the Prozac I have been a completely different person. I have been off the Prozac for over a month now. Idk if Prozac can still be withdrawing out of my system after only being on it for 3 weeks. I would think not but idk. Ever since I took that nasty drug I have been depressed on and off, complete brain fog, my vision is \"weird\" hard to explain but I can't concentrate and it almost feels like when I watch TV I have a light sensitivity to it. Just strange. I'm also nauseated most days, sometimes feel very weak, lightheaded 24/7, facial flushing, fatigued all day everyday (doesn't matter how much sleep I get), and have zero motivation to do anything. Now idk if all my problems are anxiety or not. I just feel like there's something deeper going on. I have been tested for a thyroid problem, iron, vitamin deficiencies, anemia, and a lot of other blood work. All normal. My Dr just did blood work for and auto immune disease but I'm still waiting on results for that. This is so extremely frustrating. I'm a zombie and a completely different person. Just seems like things are far worse since I've taken Prozac, but don't know how that could possibly still be in my system. Sorry for such a long post, but if anyone is experiencing the same issues and has some kind of insight that would be much appreciated! Thanks!",
