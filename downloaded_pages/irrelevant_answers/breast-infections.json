            "answer": "See another specialist, change surgeons. Mastitis, or breast infection should get better with resection and antibiotics. Have they sent out pus for analysis? You may have a lingering staff infection and may need different antibiotics. My advice, seek second opinion, see a specialized mamologist and go to another surgeon.",
