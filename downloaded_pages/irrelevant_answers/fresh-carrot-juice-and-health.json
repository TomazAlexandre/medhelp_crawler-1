            "answer": "Carotenemia is a common finding in children, mainly due to the excessive intake of carrots, but it can also be associated with the ingestion of many other yellow and green vegetables and citrus fruits. Carotene is a lipochrome that normally adds yellow color to the skin. With elevated blood levels of carotene, the prominence of this yellowing is increased. Carotenemia may be particularly evident when the stratum corneum is thickened or when the subcutaneous fat is strongly represented. The condition of carotenemia is harmless, but it can lead to a mistaken diagnosis of jaundice.Awareness of carotenemia may avoid confusion with jaundice and unnecessary diagnostic studies. Mothers may induce it by giving their infants large amounts of carrots in commercial infant food preparations.1 Hypothyroidism,2 diabetes mellitus,3 hepatic diseases, anorexia nervosa, and renal diseases may be associated with carotenemia unassociated with the ingestion of carotene.4 Carotenemia may also be associated with the ingestion of carotene-rich nutritional supplements.I turned my son's nose orange when he was a baby because I was feeding him too many carrots.\u00a0\u00a0Carrot Juice also has alot of sugar in it.\u00a0\u00a0You are definately drinking too much carrot juice.\u00a0\u00a0Everything in moderation.Trinity",
