            "answer": "Hi!One possibility is that the black spot by itself is not painful. You may be feeling the pain because of generalized pain in your feet. In this case this could be a simple mole.If the black spot by itself is painful, then it can be a melanoma. This needs to be investigated.Foot pain can be due to several causes other than diabetes. Plantar fasciitis, arthritis of small joints, hypothyroidism, high blood pressure, over weight, deep vein thrombosis, wrong foot wear, gout, etc are a few causes of sore feet. You could also be suffering from post herpetic neuropathy/neuralgia.You can dip feet in warm water and give yourself a foot massage and see if this relieves the pain. You should also wear comfortable foot wear. If these tips help lower the foot pain, you could touch the black spot and see if it is still painful.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry, but you need to see a doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response. I do indeed have Osteoarthritis and High Blood Pressure (bp diagnosed at age 17, arthritis at age 55). My weight is no longer an issue. In October of 2009, I weighed about 280, although not severely obese, I was much larger than I am now. I decided to lose weight and changed my diet in 2011 while recovering from some severe injuries resulting from an 18-wheeler accident 10/20/2009. I substituted green tea for my daily intake of Dr. Pepper and limited my caloric intake to 2000 calories or less. I now weigh 188 to 190 pounds and do generally feel better. I am still troubled with pain in my neck from multiple bulging discs, as well as nerve pain in my upper left back and shoulder, all caused by the accident. The burning in my feet began before the accident by about 8 or 9 months shortly after my first flare-up of Shingles and has been with me nightly since that time. I do wear comfortable footwear and put lotion on my feet nightly. I have soaked them in Epsom salt as well as Dr. Johnson's Oatmeal bath with neither making a difference. I do plan to see a doctor as soon as is possible regarding my overall health in general as well as the spot between my toes and foot pain. Once again, thank you for answering my post.",

    "question": "I have had a small black spot between my first and second toe of my left foot for a few months. At times, it is tender to the touch but does not itch or burn. I have not noticed a change in the size of it since I first noticed it there. I do have shingles which flares up as a burning itching rash on various parts of my feet and lower legs for the past 4 years. I also suffer from nightly nerve pain in both feet. It feels as if I am being touched by hot pokers. I have been checked numerous times in the past 4 years for diabetes with the result being negative. Do not have health insurance and am on SSDI so am on a fixed income and cannot afford a doctor visit. Will be eligible for Medicaid and Medicare in just over a year from now when I turn 62 and have been drawing disability for 2 years. Any ideas folks?",
