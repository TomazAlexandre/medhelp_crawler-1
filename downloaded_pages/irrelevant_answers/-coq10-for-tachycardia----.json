            "answer": "I was hit by tachycardia about a month after dropping statins \"cold turkey\" (they had frightening side effects). However, I had put myself on 400-800 mg (it varied) of CoQ10 immediately upon stopping the Simvastatin. The tachycardia came back several times per week, and strange heart rhythms also, for several weeks and then stopped. It's been three weeks now with no tachycardia but once in a while maybe 10 seconds of \"skipped\" beats. My tachy was diagnosed as sinus tachycardia, by the way. I don't know if the CoQ10 put a halt to the tachy, but it's gone!",

            "answer": "CoQ10 is great for the heart however unless you eat an extremely poor diet full of processed foods you should never have to take supplements.\u00a0\u00a0Chances are that your CoQ10 and metabolic enzyme levels are fine and you may just add full to the fire by taking supplements.",
