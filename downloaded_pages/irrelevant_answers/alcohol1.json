            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It could be due to alcohol allergy. There is a possibility that you are intolerant to gluten (Celiac disease). This gluten is found in malted barley, which is used to make beer and some hard ciders. Some beer also contains wheat. Other beverages sometimes made from wheat, rye, and barley include vodka, whiskey, gin and bourbon. The allergy to alcohol or to coke even can be due to preservatives, coloring agents, yeast used for brewing, sulfites, gluten products in the alcohol or even to grapes and other bases. You need to go for an allergy testing for the ingredients of the beverage you take to know what you are allergic to.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
