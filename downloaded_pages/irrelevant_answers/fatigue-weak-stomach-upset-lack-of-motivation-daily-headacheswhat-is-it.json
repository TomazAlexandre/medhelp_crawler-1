            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. However since you had blood tests all these would have been ruled out. Hence the other possibilities are sleep disorders and inadequate sleep. You may appear to sleep the customary 7-8 hours and yet not get the required amount of sleep in the right pattern. Hence it is important to get sleep studies done. The other possibility is low Vit B12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Depression too should be looked into.Other than that you could be having severe acidity. Take a late night snack. Raise head end of bed. Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks, caffeine, and spicy food. These tips may help you. Otherwise please consult a gastroenterologist to rule out IBS, Crohn\u2019s, celiac disease etc.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 16 years old and for the past 6-8 months have generally been feeling ill. I catch every virus and enfection that flys by at school. I am constantly EXTREMELY fatigued, to were I sleep in late and take several naps during the day. My stomach has been upset and my appitite decreased for about a month now. I am soooo tired that I literally feel I can not remove myself from the couch. I have been having daily headaches that are on both sides of my head. But my two worst symptoms are fatigue and headaches.I've been to the Doctor a few times now and cannot figure out why I am like this. They did blood tests and all came back fine including thyroid. They put me on vitamin D and Iron pills to see if it would help or not. It has not and I've been taking them only for about 3 weeks though now. The ONLY things that help are when I sleep and relax, and also when I am out doing something imoportant outside...then I am able to stay awake. Does anyone have any ideas what this could be??Thank you!~Irritated With Fatigue.",
