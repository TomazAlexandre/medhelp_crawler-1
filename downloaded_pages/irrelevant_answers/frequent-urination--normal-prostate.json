            "answer": "Hi,Were you assessed with regards to your diabetes?Were they able to determine fasting blood sugar levels?Have you been thoroughly worked up especially the heart and kidneys?Obesity entails several problems probably due to the fact that obesity is a risk factor in developing disease conditions like coronary artery disease, diabetes mellitus,kidney problems and cerebrovascular problems.I do not think \"the pregnant lady\"theory explains your symptoms.Obesity may play a role here but not due to the amount of weight pushing on the bladder.In pregnant women this may be the case since the uterus enlarges and presses on the bladder due to the growing fetus.Observe a healthy lifestyle and in any case, losing weight and maintaining your ideal weight will always be a healthy option.",

    "question": "I'm a 43 yo white male non-smoker. I'm 5''7'' weight 277 lbs. At night I sleep well with no need to urinate but in the day time I urinate about once an hour, weak stream, no pain, no blood, yellow urine. I have healthy sex life, once a day five times a week with great erection and discharge, no blood. I've seen my family Dr. already, My PSA is .34, ultra sound\u00a0\u00a0shows Prostate to be healthy in size. All my labs were great, low cholesterol, no diabetes, etc..They've referred me to a Urologist. Now I've gained some weight in the past two years, about 40 lbs. One of my friends said that I have the symptoms of\u00a0\u00a0pregnant lady, with all the weight pushing down on the bladder and causing lots of trips to the bathroom.I've already started to change my lifestyle, I'm becoming a vegetarian, taking Aikido.Do you think the \"Pregnant lady\" theory holds water, I'd like to know before I begin the Dr. office shuffle once more.",
