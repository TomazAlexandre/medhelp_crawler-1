            "answer": "With a cat of that age, changes in behavior are not unexpected. If you're truly concerned, have a vet check kitty out. 19 is an incredibly long life, but you should consider regular checkups to be sure kitty has quite a few years more.The knob is most likely just a solid mass, probably not dangerous. BUT...I would have it checked out. There's a possibility if that's what it is, it can/is causing issues as kitty gets older.",
