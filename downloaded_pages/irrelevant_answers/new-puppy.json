            "answer": "What did the vet say is the cause of the diarrhea?\u00a0\u00a0Did he do a fecal exam?\u00a0\u00a0What was discovered?\u00a0\u00a0Diarrhea can be dangerous, especially in the hot weather, because if it's severe the animal can dehydrate, and at this time of year, it's difficult enough to keep them properly hydrated..I wouldn't go through with the spaying until I got the diarrhea under control if I were you, since even though it's a very routine surgery, it is still stressful on the dog's body to undergo the procedure, and you want her to be as healthy as possible when it's done.\u00a0\u00a0Did the vet say anything about coccidiosis?\u00a0\u00a0What was the medication he gave you?\u00a0\u00a0Was it something called Albon?\u00a0\u00a0I'm just curious.Ghilly",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for responding!\u00a0\u00a0The vet gave her Tameri for that problem.\u00a0\u00a0She appears happy and healthy and plays all the time.\u00a0\u00a0The only other thing I can think of is her water intake.\u00a0\u00a0She drinks a tremendous amount of water.\u00a0\u00a0I will suggest the coccidiosis to our vet, she is very receptive to our ideas. I was thinking of having her tested for diabetes simply because of how much she drinks and her urine output.\u00a0\u00a0She didn't do a fecal study because she was on purely organic food as we got from an Amish family and wanted to see if it was just a change in diet as a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Once again thanks for your ideas.Marla",

    "question": "We have a 5 month old English Bulldog and she seems to drink excessively and has diarrhea, from mild to explosive.\u00a0\u00a0She also has been vomiting after eating and drinking so much water.\u00a0\u00a0Not a lot but mostly liquid.\u00a0\u00a0The vet gave us oral medication to help with the bowel movements but it doesn't seem to help much.\u00a0\u00a0She is scheduled for spaying next month and I can't help but wonder if we should delay this procedure until we find the cause of the other problems. Any ideas?",
