            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Yes, you are having some neurological problem involving one half of your body. One possibility is TIA or transient ischemic attack. This can be ruled out by a CT scan or MRI. If TIA is suspected then all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc. You need to consult a doctor urgently to rule this out.The other possibility is a nerve compression high up in the cervical region. Also, please get your blood pressure checked.Neurological symptoms in one half of the body can also be due to can be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or Lyme or lupus.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

            "answer": "Thank you. Am a little more worried now, but have an appointment with a neurologist in 2 months time. I am hypothyroid and have b12 deficiency, both of which are being treated, so I assume that as I'm on treatment for these and thyroid levels seem fine that I can rule them out?\u00a0\u00a0My main concern is brain stuff like tumour, or something either life threatening or degenerative. What would cause nerve compression high in cervical spine?Many thanks for your help.",

    "question": "Hi, I have multiple weird symptoms and am more than a little worried....Three months ago it started with intermittent pins and needles/numbness in right forearm and right leg....this was on and off, say 2/3 hours a day.....then this turned into flushes of warmth with numbness...no more tingling just numb warmth.\u00a0\u00a0It has now moved to the right side of my face and ear and is pretty much all day ( the numbness..warmth is intermittent).\u00a0\u00a0Btw when I say numbness I mean a loss of some sensation...like I'm wearing a big rubber boot on right foot and if I felt a block of ice with both hands it wouldn't feel as cold on the right side.Around the same sort of time I stared getting stabby little headaches, a twitch in my left eyelid and bouts of dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0After 3 calls to my dr he has finally referred me to a neurologist....please can anyone help shed some light?\u00a0\u00a0Many thanks.",
