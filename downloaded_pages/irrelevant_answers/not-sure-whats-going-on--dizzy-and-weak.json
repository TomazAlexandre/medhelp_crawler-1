            "answer": "The dry mouth sensation and other symptoms (hunger, dizziness, etc.) COULD be symptoms of hypoglycemia. When my sugar levels are lower than normal, I feel those things. Eyes get dry, vision can sometimes blur, and things can even look \"funny\" when glucose is extremely low. The glucose tolerance test should show whether you are hypoglycemic or not. You might try drinking a little bit of juice when you feel this way to see if you feel better quickly.",

    "question": "Hello,I'm a male 34 years old no history of diabetes in my family.About two weeks ago, I started to get dizzy and experienced heart burn for two weeks. Each time I would eat, I would have bowel movement within 5 to 10 minutes.At this point, when I'm hungry is loose my sense of balance, my vision is blurred and I feel pressure on my forehead, eyes and nose and then tingling burning sensation at my feet and finger tip and I'm somewhat thirsty.It feels like the more hungry I get, the worse the symptoms are. As soon as I eat, I get better but the process repeats again when if I go hungry again.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My urine has been fairly clear for the last week.My primary doctor ran initial blood tests on me and did not find any indications that I'm diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0However I do have all the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to do a glucose tolerance test.Now I'm kinda worried because I read online that you could loose your sight if you had diabetes or other serious complications.Does the diabetes\u00a0\u00a0symptoms can appear out of nowhere?Thank you.TapasMale , Age: 34",
