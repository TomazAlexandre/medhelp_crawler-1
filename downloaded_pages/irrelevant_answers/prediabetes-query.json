            "answer": "\"i also do glucose test. this time mine was 103 after 12hrs of sleep.\"Fasting, right? You didn't get up to snack or drink colored liquids during your \"12hrs of sleep\" did you? That will skewer you test results.So, yes, 103 mg/dl is considered prediabetes but I wouldn't jump the gun on this result. Ask for an A1c test to verify the last test result. Why? Glucose testing test at the the time of test and can be off by \u00b1 [plus/minus] 20%. Yep, that's what the FDA [Food and Drug Administration] and ISO [International Standards Organization] allow. See this for an A1c explanation.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/a1c-test/MY00142In the meantime read up on diabetes nutrition such as the Glycemic Index.",

            "answer": "\"whats an a1c test ?\"In my previous post there is a link explaining the A1c.And, no need to be sorry. Ask away. That is what this forum is for. I am not that up to date on Hashimoto's but do know proper nutrition, like diabetes, is key in helping to control and manage these diseases.There is a saying among computer users, GIYF. It stands for \"Google Is Your Friend\". Use Google to search for answers. On carbs, there are \"good\" carbs and there are \"bad\" carbs. Educate yourself on the differences.\u00a0\u00a0A good start is the Glycemic Index.http://www.lowglycemicdiet.com/compareyourdiet.html .Proper nutrition is the key to good health. Proper nutrition means to accentuate the positive when it comes to food. I dislike the word diet. \u201cDiet\u201d implies a rigorous, self-sacrificial discipline that\u2019s doomed to fail. Instead, focus on achieving food goals of what you should eat each day rather than what you shouldn\u2019t eat.",
