            "answer": "Please have a follow up to a neurologist who is a movement disorders specialist. I would strongly suspect you have tardive dyskinesia. That is a neurological disability from long term use of antipsychotics. The rate of developing it is to quote my psychopharmocologist \"for typical antipsychotics 5% per person per year and for atypical antipsychotics 2.5% per person per year\". It can be masked by the medications that cause it and sometimes emerges in severe forms such as I have where it is as severe as and clinically similar to Parkinsons's. If you were diagnosed with tardive dyskensia your psychiatrist would need to transfer you to Clozaril. That is the only currently FDA approved antipsychotic that can't create or worsen tardive dyskinesia. As well there are antipsychotics in the future, the glutamate antagonists that won't cause tardive dyskinesia, diabetes, weight gain or temporary movement disorders such as akathesia and promote a full recovery. I am on glycine a phase II antipsychotic that is a glutamate antagonist in FDA study and have been identified as having a recovery \"as good as or better than any FDA approved antipsychotics\" by my psychopharmocologist. My study will be published soon in a psychiatric journal and I will post a link to it. In addition there is treatment for tardive dyskinesia. Zofran is an option that has worked well for me. A movement disorders specialist could identify more. But I would ask about tardive dyskinesia and am surprised they didn't consider it as a diagnosis. But ask them specifically and give your history of taking antipsychotics and they be better able to help you from there.",

I was very healthy until 8years ago, when I had a stroke due to my corotid artery being severed. I was 36. MyFather began shaking around his 50's, but again to a lesser degree. My Daughter shakesbut only when using her hand excessively. I have been to so many neuro's it is sad. Thelast one being one who gave me hope, but never answered the questions I had withregard to Depakote. I have used anti-psy. drugs since the stroke due to depression.

    "question": "Every DR I go too & I mean every one tests me for Parkinsons to only reach the sameconclusion that I do NOT have it. I shake badly in my left hand & semi-badly inmy right. I get the shaking worse when I get stressed, or need my Depakote doses.I used to have seizures but it has been a yr. seizure free so they are slowly (250 mg) amonth withdrawing it from me. Question is, what will happen to me without the Depakote?As in depression wise? I take Depakote, Dylantin &\u00a0\u00a0Abilify, Lamictal & Cymbalta?",
