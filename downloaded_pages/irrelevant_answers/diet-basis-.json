            "answer": "You are right, there is a lot of confusing info out there.\u00a0\u00a0Seems like there are some companies who promote unhealthy choices for profit instead of healing.What I found works well is low carbohydrate with moderate protein and balance of fat from healthy fat sources (like avocado, olive oil, nuts, eggs, grass fed butter, coconut oil, etc).\u00a0\u00a0Typical meal is green leafy, or low-sugar vegetables, with meat/fish/eggs.\u00a0\u00a0No starchy or sugary foods like potatoes, rice, pasta and flour.\u00a0\u00a0And no low-fat or fat-free processed foods (they are loaded with sugars, carbs and chemicals).\u00a0\u00a0Stay away from margarine and other fake manmade fats.\u00a0\u00a0Fats containing high proportion of omega 3 is the healthier option (like salmon, olive oil, nuts, coconut, etc)\u00a0\u00a0Eat real whole food more than processed food.",

    "question": "Is there any specific diet for diabetic patients? There are many articles online but confusing for which to follow. Some say fruits are bad, others say they are healthy, for example, bananas. Are there certain vitamins or supplements to take or any natural change of eating habits? It may vary from person to person but generally what should one eat to control levels of blood sugar.",
