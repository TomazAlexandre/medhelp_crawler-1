            "answer": "Hello,Decreased or absent sweating is called anhidrosis. It may be caused in autonomic neuropathy like diabetes,alcoholism,Sjogren\u2019s syndrome(an autoimmune disease causing inflammation and decreased secretions by certain glands of the body) and Ross syndrome(a peripheral nerve disorder) ; skin conditions like hidradenitis suppurativa ;medicines like anticholinergics,tricyclic antidepressants and some antipsychotic; genetic disorder(hypohydrotic ectodermal dysplasia) and dehydration.I feel that a clinical evaluation and investigations are needed in confirming a diagnosis. Please consult a physician/neurologist for the same.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 30 yr old male.\u00a0\u00a0As far as I can remember I have sweat with no issues whether it be from exercising, playing sports, a hot day, or even from eating spicy foods.\u00a0\u00a0A couple months ago (maybe late September 2010) I was playing badminton.\u00a0\u00a0After a game I sat down and someone pointed out that I had goosebumps on my arm.It was unusual, but I didn't think much of it.\u00a0\u00a0Once I got home I took off my shirt and noticed the bumps all over my body.\u00a0\u00a0I immediately took a warm shower and after I got out my skin appeared to be normal again.Ever since then I have failed to sweat on my body. Im one of those types that has a wet shirt within 10 minutes of exercising.\u00a0\u00a0 So this is very unusual having dry shirts after my workouts.\u00a0\u00a0I sweat a bit from my head, but thats it.Also I wanted to note that at times before my body begins to generate heat from exercise my skin gets very itchy and prickly (I searched google and they call it prickly heat?)I have not visited a doctor due to lack of insurance.\u00a0\u00a0I\u00a0\u00a0hope that one of you doctors are aware of what this might be.\u00a0\u00a0And I hope to God there is a cure.If you need more details please do not hesitate to ask.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!Sincerely,LFFL",
