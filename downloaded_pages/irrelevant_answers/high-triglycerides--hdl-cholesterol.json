            "answer": "I would be less concered with the tri's and concentrate on your HDL. Your tri's are not terribly high, just cut back on the empty carbs like bread, pasta and sugars. Your HDL should be over 50. This is your good cholesterol which binds with LDL and tri's to take them back to your liver to be removed. Daily exercise is a good way to raise HDL or you can ask your doctor about niacin. Also, QUIT SMOKING, that's the best thing you can do to add years to your life. I doubt if you've done much damage yet, but now is the time to start.Good luck!Jon",

            "answer": "Jon is right, quit smoking.\u00a0\u00a0It's not easy, but millions of us have.\u00a0\u00a0My Grandfather referred to cigarettes as 'pimp sticks', and once I made the decision to quit, I kept that word in mind.\u00a0\u00a0It helped.The ratio of your LDL and HDL is wonderful, the HDL is pushing the LDL out of your arteries, and I'm betting your arteries are clean.\u00a0\u00a0I'd mix in a gram of Omega 3 fish oils, a gram twice a day, and I'm betting you will see your Tri's go lower.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes should be, in my opinion, your biggest worry.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and heart disease go hand in hand.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us informed.",

            "answer": "You wouldn't be posting if you were not concerned. Smoking has to stop. It has a direct relationship on your entire vascular system, including your best pump, your heart and affecting the tiny microvessels in your heart muscle. Your lipid ( cholesterol) numbers and being a women can change your profile....you need to decrease your risk by managing your lipids and controlling glucose which indicates some disturbance in carb metabolism. As for your doctor saying you're healthy???? Well, I'd follow whatever instruction he gave you about smoking and lipids and glucose, then if he hasn't given you a statin,or PRESCRIPTION fish oil, then go back to him or find another doctor more tuned into your current health status.",
