            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of chronic nausea is acidity. Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Other than that consult your gynecologist and get a complete hormone panel-FSH, LH, estrogen, progesterone and prolactin. Menopausal hormonal disturbance too could be a cause.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
