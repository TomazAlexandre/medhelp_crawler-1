            "answer": "Yikes!\u00a0\u00a0Aside from (what I hope is obvious) the fact that if he watched what he was eating he would have better control, he really, really, really, needs to be checking his blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Seriously.If he's made the choice to eat whatever he wants and manage type II diabetes with insulin, the only way to effectively do that is by checking his blood sugar before and after each meal and adjusting his insulin doses...\u00a0\u00a0at the least, his doc can, and really should have already, given him some guidelines (meaning a chart or directions that basically say, \"If your blood is this number, then take this many units of insulin\").I agree with Kevin... it sounds like he's taking too much insulin, or something else has changed....\u00a0\u00a0maybe what he's eating has changed, or maybe his insulin has changed (check the prescription compared to past vials?), or maybe how he's taking his insulin has changed (does he measure it out for himself? taking it at a different time of day from before?), or even maybe his activity level has changed (more active than before?).\u00a0\u00a0It's possible something else medically has developed as well...Plus, as we get older, our bodies change (Amen to that, hey?!) and we do start reacting differently to everything and anything we put in our bodies, including foods and especially medicines.\u00a0\u00a0He definitely needs to see his doc (someone is prescribing his insulin, right?) and maybe the doc can suggest a local diabetes educator... he does not *have* to change his diet or lifestyle, but a diabetes educator could at least help him figure out how best to use insulin...Please give us an update and let us know how he's doing!",

    "question": "My husband is 68 and was diagnosed with type II diabetes about 14 years ago. He's on 70/30 insulin, one shot in the morning and one at supper time. While he does not monitor his blood sugar, he does modify the amount of insulin he takes by what and how much he plans to eat. He pretty much eats whatever he wants to, and does snack during the evening. Over the last six months, he's had episodes of hypoglycemia during the night - anywhere from 1 to 4 am - on average once every two weeks. Most times he wakes because he's sweaty. A couple of times - last night in particular - his respiration was quite shallow, he was absolutely soaked, and not fully aware until I shook him. After some juice and a granola bar he was better. I know I need to get him to the doctor. Any clues what might be going on? Thanks!",
