            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. There are several types of neuropathy, but without being able to examine you in details I can not provide a precise diagnosis. Most common form is a peripheral neuropathy and occurred by deterioration in the nerve function at the limbs. It represents with symptoms of loss of sensation (or pins and needles like) in the arms, hands, legs and feet. Since there are many causes of neuropathy, hence treatment involves seeking these conditions out and correcting any underlying problem such as poor sugar control in diabetes in order to get a relief in your symptoms. Unfortunately, there is no permanent cure of neuropathy but symptomatic relief can be provided. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Okay i am gonna apologize in advance for the length of this.....Okay, so breif story about me, I was diagnosed with hashi's / hypothyroidism early this year (still don't have that area optimal), I have had foot pain that is extreme at times after being on my feet like walking or even just standing for 15-30 mins, Vit D deficient, and Bile Salt Diarrhea (gallbladder removal 12 yrs ago). I consulted the Foot Health board and they urged me to see a podiatrist and that is what I did.. He said \" Well I don't really see anything wrong\" and then he said \" I guess NO NEWS is GOOD NEWS\" and I said to him \"well in some cases but not this one\" and well of coarse he wants me to buy his $500 orthotics.....Oh and I have Pronation and the start of a Neuroma???I Have extreme foot pain that is not localized anywhere really on my foot, its just the foot itself that throbbs and aches and burns after standing on them for a short period of time.. I have been having this pain for almost 6yrs now and it seems to gradually be getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0My calves and ankles are a problem too.. Ankles are stiff most of the time and my calves almost always ache some times bad.. This has been going on the same amount of time.. I don't wear shorts, capri's, or sandles because my calves and feet get cold VERY easily and when my calves get cold they ache something fierce..I should also mention that my legs and feet fall asleep several times a day depending on what I am do and how I am sitting ect.\u00a0\u00a0And sometime my arms and/or hands fall asleep, once again depending on my position and what not.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I wake up in the middle of the night because my hand is asleep..\u00a0\u00a0The problem with my arms and hands started when I was pregnant with my first daughter in 2006..Okay so the research I have done says that this could possibly be Peripheral Neuropathy...??????????\u00a0\u00a0What should I do?Srry for this being so long, Any help is greatly appreciated..*all of these symptoms I have had for almost 6yrs*",
