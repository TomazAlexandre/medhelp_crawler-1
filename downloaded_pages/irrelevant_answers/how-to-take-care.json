            "answer": "The pancreas is greatly benefit by body detoxification starting with a clean colon and making sure you do not have leaky gut, or toxic colon. Also good probiotics helps in this regard. If you are seeing a doctor I am surprised he did not give you any information in that regard but either he did not know or maybe he thinks you are not smart enough to understand. Anyway you paid the guy and should not have to be here, he should be doing what he was paid to do. I would suggest a moderate diet rich in vegetables with minimal meat. Do not overeat and stay away from sweets and avoid artificial sweetners at all times. Do not eat meat with starch, it ferments in the intestines creating bad bacteria and ammonia that poisons the entire body. Smoking is bad for the body but sugar is worse, Avoid high fructose corn syrup because that is the one thing on the market that I would say is most responsible for pancreatic problems and diabetes type 2. Should you have to be told to stay away from sweets?Stay away from bread because 15 minutes after eating bread it turns to sugar in the body. Do not drink because it turns to sugar. This an elementary dietary guide and common sense\u00a0\u00a0and I am surprised you are so unaware.",
