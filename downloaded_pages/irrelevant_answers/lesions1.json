            "answer": "Hi, and welcome to the forum.\u00a0\u00a0You havent given us much information about why the MRI was done and what you have been going through.But, T2W means the images on the MRI which are T2 weighted.\u00a0\u00a0FLAIR is a technique used during the MRI which allows small lesions to be seen more clearly, especially those near the CSF (cerebrospinal fluid).Many things cause subcortical lesions as Rely mentioned including MS, vascular causes like high blood pressure, migraines, diabetes, and those things that cause inflammation of the small vessels like many autoimmune diseases (Lupus, Sjogren's).These lesions are somewhat oval and that is characteristic of the lesions of MS, but nothing you see on the MRI can prove MS or disprove MS.I agree, seeing the whole report is more helpful.If you feel comfortable, why don't you tell us your story, how old you are, and why you had the MRI in the first place?Quix",
