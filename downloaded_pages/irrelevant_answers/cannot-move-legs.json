    "question": "My mom has had peripheral neuropathy for years. The cause is unknow (no diabetes, no ms, thyroid ok, b12 ok). Each year the pain seems to be getting worse. Recently, she became unable to move her legs, yet she is not paralized. Her doctors are stumped. Have never experienced this. Just wondering if anyone else has had this. Is there some type of treatment? What could be causing her leg dysfunction?",
