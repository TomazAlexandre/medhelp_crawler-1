            "answer": "That is quite a bit to lose in such a short time, but I wouldn't be too concerned. A lot is water weight-- it is common to get dehydrated while fighting a virus, especially if you've been throwing up or having diarrhea. Losing muscle mass is also a result from being bed-ridden for a while. It is also completely natural to lose your appetite when you are sick; the body naturally wants to fast to rid itself of the toxins.You could call your doctor to get a second opinion, but I think as long as you stay hydrated and get right back to a healthy diet asap, you should feel stronger again.All the best,Brittany",

    "question": "I started getting sick two weeks ago. Just a really bad dry cough and I was exhausted. Zero energy. I've spent pretty much this entire past week in bed. I haven't been able to do much. No appetite so I haven't been eating very much either. Last Tuesday I weighed 398 and today I weigh 378. Which im not exactly complaining about but it seems like a lot to lose in a week and since I haven't been feeling well I was wondering if I should call my doctor? I've also developed diarrhea today even though the last time I even tried to eat was Monday. Any advice is appreciated. :-(",
