And 228 is bad.\u00a0\u00a0But here's the good thing, TYPE 2 can be controlled, in many cases long term, by diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Then apparently you won't have it any more - but don't forget it will come back and haunt you if you let up on the healthy lifestyle.Yes, it could have been high if you ate too many sweets.\u00a0\u00a0That is the consequence of eating sweets, when you are diabetic.Best thing you can do is get your weight down, watch what you eat and keep up with the exercising you have just started.Denial won't help you out on this one, action will.\u00a0\u00a0Once diabetic, always diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0But you can be a diabetic in 'remission'.Count yourself lucky that you are being given good notice to change things before the damage is irrepairable.",

            "answer": "I concur with Super_Sally, blood test don't lie. Your 6.2% A1c results says you've become a diabetic.I have posted this before to help others and hope you get something out of it too.Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in controlling type 2 diabetes. Restrict & avoid refined sugars, practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing this illness, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity.A high A1C level indicates a 2 to 3 month period during which red blood cells have linked up with excess sugar molecules. The most common causes are bad food choices, sugary liquids, and lack of physical exercise. During that same period, the circulatory system and nervous system is put under stress. Caffeine stimulates the production of stress hormones, which increases glucose production by the liver.Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates (starches) carefully too. For example-- things like breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. (They are converted to sugar after you eat them.)Other foods/drinks need care too (example; milk, fruit, fruit juice) can also cause blood sugar to rise (so serving sizes and moderation are important). With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose (fruit sugar). I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics.If you have an Endocrinologist, a diabetes doctor, or a diabetes nurse, or a nutritionist they can help you a lot with nutritional guidelines. (Serving sizes, and how many servings of each type food that's safe for you.)",

            "answer": "The only way you're going to know what foods you can safely eat, that doesn't raise your glucose levels, is with a home test meter. I hope you have one on the way. And, understand your body changes constantly. What you can eat one day may end up on the don't eat list the next. That's why a home meter is the best tool we have to give us an estimated glucose value.",

            "answer": "Thank you for you comments. I do have a meter, and I have done really well for the last 3 days. The highest blood sugar was 112, so far. I don't drink soda and I don't drink caffeine, so that's an easy one. However, I KNOW I have really failed\u00a0\u00a0in staying away from sweets. And good bread is my downfall. I have had a treadmill and in fact starting exercising on it before my diagnosis. I have known that I needed to exercise for awhile. I have lost 4lb in the last few weeks, so I am hoping that helps. I could stand to lose about 40 more.I am moving toward accepting the diagnosis, but I think what makes it hard is that I am an RN and I see worst case scenarios and want to believe that don't fit into that category, Yet, I know that if I don't change my habits, I WILL fit into that category. I just go back and forth.I believe that I want to \"fix\" it and be able to go back. But deep down I know I can never go back to my bad habits. This is so hard.Have any of you been able to lose the weight, exercise and keep your blood sugars under control? I would like to hear about some success stories. What did you change and does it get easier as time goes on, like developing new habits?By the way, I have a good relationship with my doc, and I think he has not referred me to anyone because I am an RN and the docs just think we know everything, but I do feel completely lost. Is there a good book anyone would recommend? And...I will be talking with my doc about referrals.",

In the end run you'll look back and say to yourself, \"That wasn't hard at all.\" What's hard is breaking bad habits. A smoker has a harder time yet hundreds-of-thousands have quit. The ones that don't make excuse after excuse after excuse. The choice you have now is either to become the healer or the patient. The former requires easy lifestyle changes, the latter a hospital bed with no lifestyle changes.margypops - Please open a new thread so we can address your concerns separately.

    "question": "Maybe I am in denial, but I am having a a hard time accepting this diagnosis. I am 52, overweight but not obese, and I have had few symptoms. However, I incidentally tested my blood sugar because a friend suggested it. (Long story) Mine has ranged from 97 all the way up to 228. Not bad really, but my A1C was 6.2 and my md says it's Diabetes type 2. I have quit all sweets, I have been exercising, and today it's been normal every time I've tested. I'm not on medication, thankfully, but I have been really watching what I eat. It's only been a week since I was diagnosed. I do feel run down at times, especially when my blood sugar was elevated. But maybe it's just because I ate too many sweets that day, or who knows. What do you think?",
