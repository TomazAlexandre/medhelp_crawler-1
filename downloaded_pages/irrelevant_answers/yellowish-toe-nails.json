            "answer": "This is caused by toenail fungus. These are fungi (called (dermatophytes) that are in the environment and infect the nails, hair and skin. The toenails get infected by walking in a gym barefoot, or wearing someone elses shoes, having moist feet and then getting in a shower where someone else had athletes foot. Breaking a toenail will make\u00a0\u00a0you more susceptible if you never were before. Since you already have these toenails infected you can take a drug called Lamisil (there is generic pill too). This will kill the fungal part of the nail and the other part just grows out. It takes months until the nail finally grows out. There is laser treatment but it costs a lot and insurance doesn't cover it. You can protect your self by walking in the gym or showers wearing clean or new flip flops but these fungi are everywhere. Wearing sandals keeps your feet dry and less likely to get them but it is bad for you back. Wearing sock is good to prevent getting exposed to them but it keeps your feet wet. So it is a toss up. Hope this helps.mkh9",

            "answer": "Also, a disease that causes chronic leg swelling and diabetes can cause yellow toe nails so you may want to see a doctor to double check your blood sugar and see if it is toe nail fungus. If you paint your toenails with yellow nail polish it can stain your nails too.mkh9",

    "question": "Hi I'm a 23 year old woman.I've recently noticed that the nails on both of my big toes have turned pretty yellow, they don't seem any different from normal nails aside from the color change. The nail of one other toe has a slightly yellowish hue as well.It looks nothing like any of the pictures I've seen of fungal infections (they are not brittle, hardened or thickened in any way) which makes me wonder what else could cause it?I haven't used nail polish for years and I walk around barefoot a lot (not in public but at home).",
