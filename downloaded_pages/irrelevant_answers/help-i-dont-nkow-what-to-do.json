            "answer": "Maybe you have a yeast infection, or jock itch. Get some Gold Bond Powder and some Jock itch cream. If you are not better in a week, get your yeast medicine, just like ladies use, at Wally World. Put a thin layer on your problem for 1 week. The yeast meds will burn, so if you put too much on, be prepared, you will have pain worse than your having now. Go to your MD if that dont help.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You are probably talking about Hidradenitis suppurativa, which presents as\u00a0\u00a0recurrent boil-like pus-like discharge abscesses resulting in difficult-to-heal open wounds and scarring. It commonly occurs on apocrine sweat gland-bearing skin such as in the groin, the underarms and under the breasts. It is also known as \u2018acne inversa\u2019. Treatment is by topical antibiotics and steroids. The disease can spread to genitals. It can also be due to staphylococcal skin infections. If your blood sugar is high as in diabetes, then too you can get recurrent boils. Wear loose fitting clothes. You can treat this by applying a warm cloth to the area. This encourages the pus to come to the surface and drain. Once the boil has drained, the area should be washed with antibacterial soap and an antibacterial cream applied and kept dry, bandaged and sterile.\u00a0\u00a0It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor preferably a skin specialist. Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
