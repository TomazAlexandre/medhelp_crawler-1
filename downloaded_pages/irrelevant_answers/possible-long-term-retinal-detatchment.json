    "question": "Hello, i'm a 23 year old male from the United Kingdom and have worn glasses for myopia for over a decade.I do alot of videogaming, and recently I have become convinced that there is something seriously wrong with my eyes, today I did a search, and I would identify my symptoms closest with Retinal Detatchment.However my mother has Diabetes, which I understand has its own problems, as well as making it more likely for this to occur..I have had flashes (occasionally, once every 6 months maybe) and have been getting these floater induced migraines for quite a few years now. My left eyelid has started to twitch alot.So i'm getting worried, although I am sure that whatever wrong is not a recent issue. Since in hindsight I have terrible situational awareness that seems now to indicate that i've had peripheral vision issues.",
