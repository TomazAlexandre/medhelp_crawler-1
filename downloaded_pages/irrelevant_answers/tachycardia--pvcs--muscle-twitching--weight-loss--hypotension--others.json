            "answer": "im assuming you've already been tested for diabetes and thyroid issues.. The sudden onset of a 200 bpm pulse and sudden stop needs to be looked into. when you say sudden, do you mean within an instant? or a few minutes? Generally arrhythmias like svt start and stop in a second, these can be treated fairly easy ususally and might ease some of your symptoms.",

            "answer": "Yes, they have done thoyroid tests on my twice now I believe.\u00a0\u00a0All their standard \"T\" tests used to detect thyroid problems, but not ALL of them.\u00a0\u00a0There is some debate from what I gather about what is a really thorough set of thyroid tests.\u00a0\u00a0And I have had a couple different diabetes tests too.And when I say sudden, I mean an instant.\u00a0\u00a0I think they are triggered after a single PVC, although I have PVCs now and again without the Tachy.\u00a0\u00a0They last for about a minute each time and suddenly stop by themselves.The trouble is this only started after all my other issues, so I'd really like to get to the underlying cause if possible.\u00a0\u00a0With so many symptoms that can be caused by chemical imbalances, I'd hate to go treating with medications which can cause more problems first.I've also had a tests for MEN2B, Adrenal Function, homocysteine levels, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The thing is that I have had a pretty good work up, but the docs seem to discount a common thread causing these multiple things to happen all at once.I have heard mention of MEN 1 a couple times, but no tests yet.",

I was having SVT for hours, multiple times a day, at rates well over 200, so it was like my body was running a marathon everyday even though i wasnt moving a muscle. i also stopped eating because eating always triggered my svt.. I had to have an ablation because i was wasting away.. I dont know if thats why you are losing weight, but it might be a factor, also the stress of it all can cause weight loss.",

If someone has had similar symptoms bundled together I'd love to hear about it too.The weight loss is what gets me.\u00a0\u00a0I've literally never lost or gained more than a couple pounds since high school.\u00a0\u00a0And in less than a year (not sure when it started exactly, could have been 3 months for all I know) somehow I lost near 18 pounds?\u00a0\u00a0Then all this stuff happens.\u00a0\u00a0It's not like I had alot of extra weight to lose.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really skinny and always have been.",

Trips to ER showed nothing, except for episodic hypertension (I am usually normal to low...110/60)and increased pulse. Holter monitor also showed nothing. I was put on an event monitor, though, which showed multiple 6-second sinus pauses with accompanying symptoms of pre-syncope and uncontrollable tremors. Then, other symptoms occurred...no appetite, constant chest pain, heart palpitations, tremors, random muscle twitching all over my body, nervousness. Cardiac etiology was eliminated through echo, measurement of cardiac enzymes, EKGs. Thoughts?",

    "question": "Hello all.About 18 months ago (sudden onset), I was in and out of the ER for a couple weeks then admitted to the hospital for a week while all sorts of tests were run (blood,ECG,CT,MRI,etc.).Initially I presented with orthostatic hypotension (up to 130bpm), dizziness, weakness, and flush feelings.\u00a0\u00a0They thought I was just dehydrated and not eating well. Dehydration was certainly possible, but I eat very well. If anybody has suggestions...Previously:- ConstipationInitially:- Tachycardia- Weight loss (16lbs)- Light headed- Cold, shaking, fluids helped alotOver the next several months:- Muscle twitching everywhere, even internal, not painful- Ringing ears- Foginess a few times- Skipped beats- Tachycardia (7 times now) at 200bpm...ish. for about 1 minute each time. Sudden start and stop.- Sudden Tension HeadachesAt first, they put me on fludro (smallest dose) and BP shot to 150/90 within 1.5 days.\u00a0\u00a0So I downed to 1/4 pill.\u00a0\u00a0A couple weeks later I went into the ER for chest discomfort and my potassium levels had dropped under the min and I got pills.\u00a0\u00a0I went off fludro and started adding moderate salt to my diet.I've gone on to feel much better. Take a magnesium pill (helps twitching), hydrate well, and eat better.\u00a0\u00a0Gained weight back.\u00a0\u00a0I have more HR variability than average when breathing.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still thinking electrolytes, even though tests have been fine. They refuse to link lots of this together even though it all started together.The heart stuff worries me and I just want to get to a root cause of all this and not treat symptoms.Thanks in advance",
