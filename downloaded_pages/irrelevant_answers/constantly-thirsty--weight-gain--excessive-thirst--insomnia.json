Excessive thirst and irritability are two of the symptoms of type 1 diabetes. Others are fatique, increased urination and increased hunger. I would advise you to not wait another day. It is a simple blood test and hopefully it will be normal, but if she has diabetes she needs medical help immediately. I am not trying to alarm you, but it is better to error on the side of caution.Please let us know what you find out and if we can help in any way.dm",
