            "answer": "You may have pre-diabetes -- if you have a weight problem (especially abdominal weight) then the high insulin is insulin-resistance which is pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Low testosterone is common in this setting.Would need further testing as a \"high\" thyroid hormone likely means high TSH which means HYPOthyroidism but you need to talk with your doctor to confirm this.Would also test LH,FSH, Prolactin to see if this may be a pituitary problem.An endocrine consultation seems appropriate given these problems at age 38.",

            "answer": "The thyroid is likely normal -- would repeat TSH and FREE T4 in about a month to see if there is a true T4 increase (better to test free than total in this case).Testosterone treatment is appropriate as you try to lose weight (if applicable).",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 38 years old male. After a recent blood-test I have been told that my thyroid hormones are high ( I do not recall which particular hormone it is), my insulin is very high and my testosterone is very low.I have been experiencing hair loss, increased bowel movements. sweating, difficulty in sleeping, very low libido and fatigue / lack of concentration.Can you please tell me whether this combo of high thyroid , high insulin and low testosterone is a sign of hyperthyroidsim, pituitary problems, or something else.Also what over the counter medicine can help (I took multi-vitamins but they increase my bowel movements and taking B12 alone increases ringing in my ears)I would really appreciate your advise.Thanks.Gill",
