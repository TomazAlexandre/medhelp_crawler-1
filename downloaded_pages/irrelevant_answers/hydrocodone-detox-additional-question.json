            "answer": "The rls was the worst for me.\u00a0\u00a0The hot Epsom salt baths helped.\u00a0\u00a0I also found a supplement Natural Calm which is a magnesium powder mix that really helped me sleep.\u00a0\u00a0It is also for anti-anxiety so I still use it in the evenings when I feel I need help winding down. Honestly the rls lasted for me for a few weeks, getting a bit better after about the first 7 days. Yes, everybody is different though. You can get through this and you will be so proud when you are done with the physical WD's.\u00a0\u00a0Keep moving forward!Happy Be-lated Mother's Day to you!",

            "answer": "The momwithnosleep is actually part of my email my husband made as a joke when I was pregnant with the twins. At 2 when everything was normal again, twins potty trained I thought WOW I can finally fall asleep with my husband at night & stay there. 2 months later at 2 1/2 One was also diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes\u00a0\u00a0so almost 7 years of round the clock blood sugar Checks has caused the name to stick. Its never bothered me before. Even though I had the RLS if I couldn't sleep no biggie, there i had something to do. I guess with the whole withdrawel stuff and not having the meds my mind is bothered by the RLS!!LOL",

    "question": "I know its different for everyone but can anyone btdt Noroc 4xdaily and the restless feeling when I lay down to sleep. The last 2 nights I dry heaved into a bucket until I fell asleep. Hubby gets up VERY early for work and drives all day so I didn't want to disturb him that way again tonight. Its 2:30am I am soaking in hot tub. My day starts in 3 hours at which time I will have been up for 23 hours with no chance of napping or trying to sleep for another 16 hours after that . I am getting out of the tub, i guess try taking an ibuprofen, check my sons blood sugar (type 1 diabetic) and try this thing again. I have been trying off and on for 4 hours. Lay down but cant lay still : (",
