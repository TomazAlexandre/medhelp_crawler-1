    "question": "I too have been suffering with cold knee symptoms which keep me awake at night with what I can only describe as a frozen pain.\u00a0\u00a0I am usually warm everywhere else and can on occasions suffer with burning feet.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that i am either one extreme or another but this does only occur at night.\u00a0\u00a0I also periodically get irritable legs so whether this is all related or not is debatable as the symptoms so far have been on separate occasions.\u00a0\u00a0I am in my 50 s and suffer with cold night sweats which I put down to the menopause, I can just about tolerate that but the frozen knee symptoms are awful.\u00a0\u00a0Many of you have spoken about thyroid which I think is worth looking into, but if anyone else has any suggestions I would be interested in hearing about them.This discussion is related to/posts/Undiagnosed-Symptoms/corfu-flu/show/2185173.",
