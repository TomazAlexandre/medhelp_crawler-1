This is the best way to know what goes wrong while you sleep.Low blood sugar, thyroid problems and an irritable bowel are a few possibilities that you should get investigated for.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "A lot of the symptoms you describe sound like panic attacks. To make sure it is just your stress level and not something else bringing them on, I recommend you ask the doctor to test your catecholamines and plasma free metanephrines.\u00a0\u00a0Your seratonin drops when you go into your mense which can affect a person negatively.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you should ask the doctor to test your CBC and especially your iron and ferritin levels.\u00a0\u00a0If your iron level is low, this can cause tachycardia.",

            "answer": "HiYes, you should get tested for diabetes or even for low blood sugar. Since you mention not able to eat certain things without feeling queasy, I think there are 2 possibilities. One is that you have a food allergy to say anything\u2014dairy products, gluten, lactose, fructose, carbohydrates etc. So not being allergic to dairy products does not mean you are not allergic to other things. Hence you must get a comprehensive food allergy/intolerance test done.The second possibility is acidity with gastric reflux. Omeprazole is a good drug to combat this. Along with it you can try over the counter antacids. Avoid heavy meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bed at least 2 hours after food. If these tips help you then you have a gastric reflux.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hypoglycemia is caused by/is essentially low blood sugar... so yes, I'm getting tested for that as well as pre-diabetes. :-)As for food allergies, in the same time period that I've been having these problems, I've done a complete allergy elimination diet twice, and I didn't react at all to anything.Gastric reflux I'm also doubtful because I'm already avoiding almost everything you mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0I have coffee, tea, fried food, and soda less than once each within a period of several months.\u00a0\u00a0As for alcohol... I'm 17 and not interested in the trouble involved with underage drinking.\u00a0\u00a0I don't do heavy exercise after meals, and I go bed late, so it is almost always at least two hours after I've eaten.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the tips!Surgimenopause, thanks for the blood test info.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently a LOT of people my age start having problems with low blood sugar...-Liz",
