            "answer": "thanks, that is an encouraging thing to hear because I did heal quickly after each of my C-sections earlier which were at 28 and 32. However, since I am older now, I am concerned about how resilient I may or may not be. Also because the site of the next incision will probably be the same, will it be riskier or take longer to heal. Does having a baby in the forties increase the chances of birth defects?",
