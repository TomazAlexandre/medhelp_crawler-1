            "answer": "In a young male, the feeling of a sudden urge to urinate (\"urgency\"), feeling of incomplete voiding,\u00a0\u00a0altered sensation of filled bladder, and frequency, need to be evaluated to rule out an underlying infection of the bladder called cyctitis. It is, however, uncommon for this to last 2 yrs. Urinary infections are more common among diabetics.In older men, we could suspect an enlarged prostate as a cause of these symptoms.You need to get a urine test (including cultures), blood sugar, and an abdomino-pelvic ultrasound done.",

            "answer": "thanks for your guidance. Yes its been further two years and symptoms are more or less the same except that i think the urgency is not that much (or perhaps i have got adopted to it now) but the urine volume is still less (I pee for a duration of around 10-15 secs but never have checked the volume in figures) . I got my urine / blood / prostritas tests done and all are normal. Any clues what else could be the reason? or should i go for the ultra sound?",

    "question": "I am 27 M. I am having this problem from last 2 years. The problem is that everytime I feel to urinate, I feel as if my bladder is not fully filled. That is, whenever I feel the urge to urinate and I urinate, the urine is not up to the quantity it should be.,In other words, i feel the urge to urinate with a less filled bladder. and this urge is sometimes so sudden that i feel that i am stopping urine from my penile muscles (and i really have to work hard to stop my urine in such cases, which some times even leaks a bit)....Can any one guide me if this problem seems to be related to prostrate, bladder, or something related to penis/reproductive system? or does these symptoms show the signs of diabetes ( I got in my family)Many thanks",
