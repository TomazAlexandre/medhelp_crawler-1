            "answer": "You cannot be in the Army with diabetes, Which honestly I find stupid. Who is it that says, oh your diabetic so that means your gonna drop too low or go too high. No with the right amount of insulin and eating healthy and not skipping meals, you can live a normal life. I'm 16 years old, extremely active, and on August 8th of this year, I was diagnosed diabetic. Never been sick from it before, and still haven't. I eat right and exercise and my sugars are fine. I think it is discrimination that we cannot do certain jobs.",

            "answer": "I didnt think you could be in the Defence Forces either, unless you got diabetes after you joined then you might be asked to leave. Mind you, I dont know much about restrictions on type ii so could be different if you have that type. However, diabetes wouldnt be considered a reason for them not to expect you to lose weight, in fact if we led the model life of a diabetic we wouldnt be overweight (so says a non model type 1 overweight diabetic lol).",
