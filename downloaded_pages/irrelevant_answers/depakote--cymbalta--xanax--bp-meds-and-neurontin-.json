            "answer": "I just started taking the depakote, I havent started on the neuronton yet for the same reasons you state.As far as the numbness, are the symptoms that made you seek medical help numbness & tingling , or are you saying the meds you are on make you emotionally numb? The depakote was like flipping a switch at first, the anxiety was unbearable before I took it. But the anxiety didnt get so bad till I realized I really did have a ruptured disc in my neck, so I'm going through the stress of sorting through whats physical and whats mental. I guess I'm trying to find someone who has been through the same symptoms.",

            "answer": "I'm not really in pain. I just feel icy all over. The neurologist says my mri doesnt show anything bad enough to make me numb. The abscense of pain is pointing him toward diabetes, but the blood tests havent come back yet. The symptoms that bother me are just this.hot feels cold , cold feels hot, my arms are weak and sometimes my legs.I have no doubt I'm bipolar, and since starting the depakote, the symptoms are better.But not gone.",

            "answer": "As long as both docs know what your taking you should be fine. But you can google a drug interaction checker-I use it all the time. You out in all your meds and it gives you the data on any interaction. Such as moderate drug-drug or Severe drug-drug, it's helpful but not as good as talking to both docs and letting them share charts. That's what I do since I have 2 docs also.Best of luck,Erin",

    "question": "Just the title sounds like a suicide cococktail. I\u00a0\u00a0am seeing 2 docs , one Psych guy , and a neurologist.I have pathology in the cervical mri, but supposedly not enough to cause my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The Psychiatrist knows I'm going to the neuro guy, but the nuero doc doesnt know I'm seeing the Shrink( no offence).My symptoms , as I've posted many times , are numbness & tingling , with no overt pains for an overweight guy that still tries to be active . What does neurontin do. It's kinda scary when ya think about it ....all that shtuff running thru your liver, but I will say this , the depakote was like flipping a switch in me , 2 days and I was a different person. I just dont wanna be dopey. How long will it take the sleepiness to go away. Will the neurontin make it worse?",
