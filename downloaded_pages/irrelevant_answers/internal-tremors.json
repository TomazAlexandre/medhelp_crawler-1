            "answer": "Hi.Although your symptoms may be non-specific and could be associated with many types of conditions, the finding of tremors, paresthesias, and heat intolerance could suggest a thyroid disorder as a likely cause. Some other conditions that need to be ruled out include vitamin and mineral deficiencies, as well as diabetes.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "You may have gotten your answer by now and would be glad to hear what you found out!\u00a0\u00a0For me, the internal shaking, which started in the chest as you, has evolved to the feet/lower leg\u00a0\u00a0mostly.\u00a0\u00a0It moves up at times to the chest.\u00a0\u00a0 I think anxiety is the cause for me. And then it seems to cause more anxiety so a nasty cycle.\u00a0\u00a0 Plus I had a hysterectomy 10 yrs. ago. So the hormone aspect may contribute.\u00a0\u00a0But I do have that internal shake/vibration as you describe for yourself.\u00a0\u00a0And exactly as you say, when active the sensation is much\u00a0\u00a0less troublesome.",
