            "answer": "Hi,It is important to know if you have been evaluated for peripheral neuropathy. Peripheral neuropathy can occur due to diabetes, B 12 deficiency and thyroid dysfunction.I would suggest you to take B complex supplements and see if they help with your symptoms.Also did you undergo MRI of brain or spine?MRI of lower back will also help since you have pain on sitting on your left buttock, nerve compression should be ruled out in that area.",
