            "answer": "It is often difficult, if not impossible, to determine the cause(s) of urticaria, commonly called hives.\u00a0\u00a0It often takes a great deal of sleuthing by a physician familiar with the disease, usually a board certified allergist.\u00a0\u00a0However hives can sometimes be a sign of underlying, systemic disease, which should be the main focus at this time, given your father\u2019s night sweats and night time awakening with shortness of breath.Night sweats are seen with tuberculosis, diabetes, and malignant diseases among others.\u00a0\u00a0Like hives, night sweats can also occur without discernible cause.\u00a0\u00a0Awakening at night could be heart or lung disease or laryngospasm due to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).\u00a0\u00a0Your father is a young man and every effort should be made to determine the cause of these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If his doctor is a family practitioner, he should seek consultation with an internist.\u00a0\u00a0Your father could now be allergic to the dogs.",

            "answer": "One thing, which I've come to suspect, as of yesterday, is \"metal allergy\". I've had hay fever most of my life and have developed food allergies. When tested, I was allergic to most everything in life.Most Dr.s probably won't entertain my thoughts, but I believe (and am currently trying to ascertain), my symptoms may be from new metal partial plates, which I got about two years a ago.I'll report on my finding later.",

    "question": "My dad is 54.\u00a0\u00a0He has had hives now for 8 months now.\u00a0\u00a0He had them about 3 years ago for 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0However, this time they are different.\u00a0\u00a0They are more concentrated to one area (knees, elbows, groin, butt cheeks, belly) where as before they came up in various places.\u00a0\u00a0He has been on numerous rounds of steroid packs, zyrtec, hydroxyzine, cyproheptadine, and various others with little or no relief.\u00a0\u00a0The only medications that he takes daily are propanalol and prilosec.\u00a0\u00a0He has cut back on both of these to see if that would help but again no relief.\u00a0\u00a0In the beginning the steroids would help but the hives would come right back.\u00a0\u00a0He also has these spells for a long time now where he wakes up in the middle of the night and can't breathe.\u00a0\u00a0Now he is having some night sweats.\u00a0\u00a0He has been to an allergist and was told he was allergic to so many things but didn't take that very seriously b/c he has never had a problem with all those things in the past.\u00a0\u00a0He is scheduled to see a dermatologist in January.\u00a0\u00a0We really need help.\u00a0\u00a0This is driving my poor father crazy and makes him miserable.\u00a0\u00a0We have two small house dogs for 8 years now....he couldn't have developed an allergy to them could he?",
