            "answer": "Dear melgonzales64,i am a diabetic like you and not a doctor or medical professional. Alcohal has many different effects on diabetics which is why the American Diabetes Association recomends diabetics only drink two drinks a day. If you take insulin for the alcohol it will just lower your blood sugar since alcohol doesn't need insulin for it to be digested. Alcohol malso has the further effect of lowering blood sugar without the extra insulin, so alcohol should only be taken while eating. i no longer drink unless my wife and i go to\u00a0\u00a0a restaurant and then\u00a0\u00a0i only have 1 or 2 beers and do this only once or twice a month. i find i can keep better care of my diabetes without alcohol.take care, bret",

            "answer": "Under normal circumstances, the liver releases emergency sugars when a person's glucose levels drop below the normal ranges. Although some studies tend to indicate that some type 1 diabetics do not release these emergency sugars quite as well as non-diabetics, there is still a store of emergency sugars to help. Unfortunately, one of the things that alcohol does is preventing this release of emergency sugars. If you do some research on this subject you will find that many doctors suggest that diabetics either don't drink alcohol at all or limit the intake to 1 drink. Obviously, each diabetic must determine for himself whether he or she will consume alcohol. But you should make an informed decision... The danger is that the diabetic will get low, not be able to feel it while under the influence of alcohol, and then will not be able to release the emergency stores of sugar to help him- or herself.",
