            "answer": "I think GD is based on glucose intolerance meaning that your body isn't putting out enough which would leave you with HIGH blood sugar not low. (not positive about that though) So I am thinking that probably isn't the problem. The best way to bring your blood sugar up is to drink a glass of juice, OJ, apple, anything sugary but juice is better than soft drinks. It can take 15 minutes or more to feel relief then you should eat a meal or something with protein in it. That will help stabilize things. The best way is to not get it in the first place. You may want to eat more frequently. Smaller meals. If you are at work and can't eat a meal, then bring healthy snacks and munch. Fruits, nuts and vegies work great for this. Having juice handy is also good.",

Yesterday my whole range of vision was like shotting back and forth for like 10 seconds, and it made me sooo dizzy, and today I was standing there and I got extremely dizzy, and then shaky and then wickkked sweaty! Is this normal at 31W, or something I should be concerned with? I was drinking lots of water so I wasn't dehydrated, any advice?",
