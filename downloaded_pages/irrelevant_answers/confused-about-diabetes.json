You first state your had low levels but not low enough, then say you had a hypoglycemic attack. Please clarify your hypoglycemic attack. When and where did this take place? How do you know - was doctor or nurse present to test you then?\"...during the initial bloods on the 1st day my blood sugar was extremely high\"You don't mention what meds you were put on or what foods you consumed 10 hours prior to being admitted. Any could raise your glucose level.\"my father and uncle had diabetes \" \"I am 38 years old - slightly overweight\"You are a candidate and being \"slightly overweight\" makes you even more so. But earlier on you say \"and have gained a lot of weight\". Another contradiction. I hope you don't speak with your doctor this way.\"Can I have an intermittent diabetes problem?\"You could be borderline and/or pre-diabetes. Weight, diet, exercise play a large role in preventing and then controlling diabetes. Keep in mind certain medications can raise glucose levels. Always discuss with the pharmacist the side effects.You may also want to schedule an appointment with a Neurologist to discuss your imbalance issues. This could be diabetes related or something going on with your cranial/nerves.Lastly get a hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c or HbA1c) test.

            "answer": "You need to continue to lose weight and carefully monitor the type of foods you eat. You don't mention if you had your Hemoglobin tested, specifically the HgbA1c test. This test assist doctors by determining your glucose levels over the past 3 months. Red cells live an average of 3 months. Excess glucose will remain on new red cells and the HgBA1c will measure this. Don't know if your UK doctor does this, I'm only familiar with USA medical standards.",

            "answer": "There is no such thing as a \"intermittent diabetes problem\" you have it or you don't and from what I am reading of your post , I think it is very likely you do. Diabetes is managable, left untreated/managed it can lead to blindness, kidney, heart, nerve problems, ambutations, stroke.Thirst & frequent urination is also a sign. Get an A1c as soon as possible. If you do have diabetes this will tell you, as said here by Dot-this test measures the average blood sugar over the last 3 months.Please take care of this now to avoid major problems and to start to feel much healthier!",
