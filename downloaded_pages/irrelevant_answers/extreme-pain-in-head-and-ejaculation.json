            "answer": "Terrible, unbelievable pain moments before ejaculation.. I know this one...I have had this when I was 18 yrs old, 31 yrs old, and 37yrs old.

    "question": "Within the last couple of weeks I have noticed that nearing ejaculation during intercourse, I have tremendous pressure and pain in my head, to the point of excruciating. I am 46 years old, I have type two diabetes and take blood pressure medicine, but both are in check and my numbers are good.\u00a0\u00a0This pressure in my head seems directly connected to the act of ejaculating.\u00a0\u00a0It starts hurting and pounding in my head nearing\u00a0\u00a0the point of ejaculating to the such pain that I cannot finish or I feel that my head will explode!\u00a0\u00a0When I stop, the pain continues like an extreme migraine that is incapacitating, I have to take migraine or aspiring pills and lay down for a long while before it settles down.\u00a0\u00a0I checked my blood pressure before the last time I did this, to see if my BP was high, it was 123/83 so I don;t feel that my blood pressure was too high.Needless to say that I am extremely concerned on several levels; 1.\u00a0\u00a0Do I have some type of blockage in my blood flow in my head?\u00a0\u00a02. Can this kill me?\u00a0\u00a03. Can it be fixed?\u00a0\u00a04. Will I ever be able to have normal sex again?\u00a0\u00a05.\u00a0\u00a0What is my course of action.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to get an appointment with my primary care physician....Thanks, Lou",
