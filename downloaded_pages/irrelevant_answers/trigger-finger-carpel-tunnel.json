            "answer": "I have trigger finger in both middle fingers. Right now, I am splinting them every night. When I wake up, they need to be flexed since they are very stiff. Usually that's the first step. If you get no relief, there are steroid injections (which I can't have due to type 2 diabetes; they will make my BS go up too much, according to the dr.)You might want to find a public health clinic where you live that can offer payment plans or sliding scale. Good luck.",

            "answer": "I would try to find a good chiropractor. They treat more than the spine. Mine is incredible and treats also my foot and my knee. I have gotten more relief from seeing a chiropractor than I have anything else. It is much cheaper than surgery and has no side effects unlike surgery. If I had known that chiropractors treat more than the spine I could have avoid surgery for tarsal tunnel.good luckachilles2",

    "question": "Does anyone out there suffer from either of these conditions, and/or know someone who does? I was one day from surgery to attempt repair/relief...and my insurance was canceled. Now, I am slowly suffering with both, but the trigger finger is what seems to bother me most at this point. Is there any relief other than surgery? Does surgery help alleviate the pain, or does it take care of it altogether? All responses are welcome and appreciated. I am a walking 'mess of a 36 yr old\"!",
