            "answer": "Just wanted to add that I don't think a diabetic has risks for birth defects or anything. A lot of women end up with a form of diabetes during there pregnancy that lasts only through their pregnancy, its called gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0All they have to do it watch what they eat throughout their pregnancy and get their blood drawn regularly. You already do that (eating and testing your blood sugar), so you should be okay. I would have a consultation with your doctor to be safe as well. Good Luck to you!Heather",

I have had the same fears and worries that you are having right now.\u00a0\u00a0But I have done a ton of research and talked to a diabetic nurse practitioner who focuses only on pregnant women and I feel much better now.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know what your hemoglobin A1C is?\u00a0\u00a0They like it to be less than 7 before getting pregnant and you should try and keep your sugars less than 150 or so.\u00a0\u00a0They said the outcomes are usually no different from a non diabetic if you can get close to these goals!\u00a0\u00a0Are you on an insulin pump or do you take shots? I have recently switched to the pump and it has helped me regulate myself so much.\u00a0\u00a0 They say that even diabetics who are way out of control still have healthy babies 75% of the time, so imagine how much better our chances are if we try our best to take care of ourselves!\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like we have a lot in common.\u00a0\u00a0 I also suffered a miscarriage 3 1/2 weeks ago with my first baby. I was 6 weeks along..\u00a0\u00a0It has been very difficult but my doctor assures me that it is in no way r/t to my diabetes because my A1C was only 6.2.\u00a0\u00a0 I am ready to try again as well.\u00a0\u00a0She suggested I wait 8 weeks, but said it would be ok if I got pregnant earlier than that. I am still anxiously waiting for my first cycle though. I look forward to keeping in touch with you as we share this struggle together. I will keep you in my prayers.",

I had enough senses about me to down a coke before it happened so everything worked out without an emergency room visit, but it was very scary for me.\u00a0\u00a0I was by myself and in my car.\u00a0\u00a0Keep your chin up...it is possible....I am anxious to hear from you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",
