            "answer": "Hi,Infections can definitely cause blood sugars to rise as your body fights off the infection.In regard to the bilirubin--it would depend on the rest of your liver panel. Diabetes can cause fatty liver disease which then shows up as abnormal liver tests. You are also at higher risk for gall stones, and this may cause those results. An abdominal ultrasound would be helpful.Take care.",

    "question": "Background: I have a recurent sinus infection. My physician has suggested an MRI - I suppose to confirm diagnosis. Notwithstanding that, I am a type II diabetic - last A1c, approx. 7 mos ago was 5.2 - and I have noticed a spike in blood glocose level when the sinus problem manifests. Question: Is there a potential cause and effect between the infection and the blood glucose spike?One other question, bilirubin of 1.6 and is noted as high, but acceptable on CBC report. Have you an opinion re: elevated bilirubin level?Thanks",
