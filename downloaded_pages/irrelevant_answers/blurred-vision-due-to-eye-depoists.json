    "question": "My Father's age is 67, he is not diabetic nor he has got blood pressure or any other aliment, an year ago he started having a blurred vision in both eyes particularly the left eye which always remains watery, the Dr diagnosed it as cataract in both eyes but when he went in for his surgery for cataract\u00a0\u00a0, the Doctor says he has got some sort of floating elements/ deposits in his left eye besides cataracts which could be due to blood pressure , or diabetes but since has none of them we can not understand the cause for it nor its treatment, it is understood by his eye specialist that it could be due to blockage of blood supply, can u please tell us about his eye problem in more detail and can u tell us about the required treatment for it ..! Thank you so muchSara..!",
