This is such a relief because I had gestational diabetes with my last pregnancy and thought for sure I was doomed to have it this time. I am so glad I will not have to be induced for this reason again.. I have to add aslo that I cannot believe how fast this pregnancy is going, Im 27 wks and counting,,,,,It just flew by. Guess the holidays help....",
