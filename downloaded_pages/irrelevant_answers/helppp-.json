    "question": "I'm 35 weeks and 2 days but I have gestational diabetes so my baby was measuring at 40 weeks last Tuesday. My belly dropped yesterday and for the past 6 hours I've had painful contractions every half hour as well as non painful tightening of my stomach every 5 to 10 minutes. I know these aren't braxton hicks contractions because they're timeable and aren't going away but also if I was truly in labor I feel like they should be getting closer together in time and the pain should be getting stronger. Does anyone have any experience in a situation like this? If so, how long until you went into actual labor? Also if anyone has any advice on how to stay as comfortable as possible during this time that would seriously be so amazing. I'm so miserable right now, on top of the pressure from her dropping and the contractions my acid reflux is also super bad right now and my back is killing me. I just want this all to end.. :(",
