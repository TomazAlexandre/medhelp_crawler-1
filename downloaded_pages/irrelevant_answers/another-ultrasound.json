So many women get induced because they're told they have a \"big\" baby due to ultrasounds and the baby comes out being 6 ot 7 pounds.",

Otherwise I wouldn't have gotten another one. Position and approximate size can be determined by palpation and abdominal measurement by any reasonably competent midwife or obstetrician - an ultrasound isn't necessary by any means without high risk indicators.",
