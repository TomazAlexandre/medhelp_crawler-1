            "answer": "Hi Anish,I indeed feel sorry for you and your family that you'll have to go all through all this.Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic, systemic, autoimmune inflammatory disease affecting synovial joints and extra-articular systems, including the skin, eyes, cardiovascular system, bronchopulmonary system, spleen, and nervous system.I am sorry to say if he has got repeated infection at the wound; it is indeed difficult to say when it would heal.Has he been investigated for Diabetes? This could be one of the causes for delayed healing. The other possibility could be any bleeding disorder or coagulation disorder causing delayed healing or no healing.Is that the wound which is not healing or the bone is not getting healed?I think you need to also see whether there is adequate blood supply to the part or not.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hello. My father is born in 1955 and had motorcycle accident when he age between 26-28 and soon after his tibia bone where it was broken got infected had to go under, if Im corrected, tibia debridement surgery. Which had to shave off the infected part of his bone. After couple of years he had to go under same surgery because of reinfection. The time doctors where concerned that if they have to do same surgery again the tibia would be too narrowed to hold his own weight. First surgery was done in Soviet Union Russia, and second one was in Mongolia. But same place got infected and had to do surgery 2 months ago, which was in Mongolia. Now the same pain is back!!Please advise me on what his options are, and what country treatment or surgery might be good for him.Thank you very much",
