I saw a nurse at a free clinic at 6 weeks and she wasn't able to see the baby through an ultrasound and told me to watch out for signs of a miss-carriage. I was spotting, but that stopped. Due to my work and current location, I haven't had a chance to see a new Dr. yet. How long can I wait before I receive care? And should wait or try to see someone right away?",
