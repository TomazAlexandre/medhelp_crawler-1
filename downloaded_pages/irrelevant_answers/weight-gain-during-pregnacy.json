            "answer": "Im 11 weeks pregnant. I went to see my midwife on Tuesday and compared to my last visit I have lost weight, but I cant do my jeans up and my stomach is sticking out a bit. I seem to eat all the time. We think the reason for the weight loss is because Ive just stopped skating and its muscle that Ive lost. I did this with my last two also. I think as long as you are putting weight on even just a little and you eat well there should be know problem. The baby takes what it needs and we are the ones to miss out. Thats what I understand. Also because when you are pregnant you seem watch what you eat and that can make a difference also.",

I only drink water or milk most of the time. I dont eat sausage or bacon for breakfast with my eggs. Just small stuff like that. And I try to stay away from fast food...",
