            "answer": "The episodes have occurred sometimes in the night if something\u00a0\u00a0wakes him prematurely, sometimes when he is waking from naps, and sometimes in the morning as he wakes.\u00a0\u00a0The episodes have been recent ( I just started to notice them in the past few weeks) He has had maybe 5 or 6 episodes since that time. It doesn't happen every time.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried to notice changes in daily routine. He has stopped taking naps every day.\u00a0\u00a0He will skip some days and go to bed around 8:00.\u00a0\u00a0Other days he will nap late in the day and go to bed around 10:00.\u00a0\u00a0His sleeping and eating patterns have always been very good.\u00a0\u00a0He hasn't had an episode in a few days.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to know what to do, if this continues.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be allergies, diabetes, or a sleeping disorder????",

            "answer": "Dear Kristin,The episodes are likely confusional arousals, a type of partial wakings that are normal developmental occurrences for a child this age. There's no need to worry about them, and they do not signify a problem.Don't try to wake up your son at such times - just let the episode run its course, which will often end with the youngster falling back asleep.If you want to learn more about such episodes, look at Richard Ferber's book, Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems (published by Simon and Schuster).",

    "question": "My 2 1/2 year old son seems to be having episodes of confusion, especially as he is waking up.\u00a0\u00a0He will cry uncontrollably and accept no comfort.\u00a0\u00a0The episodes will last sometimes 45 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0He is almost in a stupor.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes what he says does not make sense.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't even let me touch him or hold him.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing I do, sing, say, or try ever helps during these episodes.\u00a0\u00a0I usually sit in the same room helplessly\u00a0\u00a0until he works it through himself.\u00a0\u00a0When he comes out of it he always says hi! momma!, smiles and continues his day as though nothing happened.\u00a0\u00a0I'm beginning to think he has a physical problem. Could the confusion, and stupor be caused by low blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0Could there be another physical illness that I don't know about that could cause this?\u00a0\u00a0He has always been very sensitive to sweets.\u00a0\u00a0I am very careful about the amount of sugar he receives, and the time he eats sugary things.\u00a0\u00a0These episodes really became evident around Thanksgiving when family was here to feed him all the sugar he could eat.\u00a0\u00a0He throws the normal two year old fits, but this is different.\u00a0\u00a0I never punish him for this, because I have a gut feeling it is beyond his control.",
