            "answer": "He hasn't taken any antibiotics lately. He always tends to brush things off and never sees the doctor, hence me asking here on this site. Hopefully my symptoms will be enough to convince him that this is more than dry skin. He's only 32, but he consumes very large amounts of sugar in the form of soda and weighs about 275. The thought of him being diabetic or immune-compromised terrifies me, but I haven't read anything good about male yeast infections on the internet.",

            "answer": "The above poster is right, it could be diabetes. Your husband should go in to be tested. It's a very simple test the Dr can do right in his office.Can I ask if you've had a yeast infection in the past? If so, he may have gotten it and the two of you are passing it back and forth. Both of you have to be treated, if that's what's going on.",

I told him about the possible connection with diabetes, but he laughed and told me to stay off the internet. : (I cannot remember having a yeast infection in at least 2 or 3 years. If I had one, it was too mild and I missed it. I hope that I simply passed it on to him while unaware that I had one. Thanks for the input.",

    "question": "My husband has had dry, flaky, peeling, red skin on the glans continuing about an inch or so down the shaft of his penis. No itching, no burning, no sores, no white spots, no discharge.He does not wear underwear, so I thought it was chafing at first. We started putting vaseline on it, and he began wearing underwear. It got better, though the skin still looked dry. There has been no frequent or dry masturbation or\u00a0\u00a0sex going on.It's been 2 months now, and the problem is still ongoing. The skin is peeling again. We had sex 3 nights ago because he assured me it was just dry skin, and now my vaginal entrance is itching and burning.How likely is it that he has a yeast infection even though he has no discharge, sores, or itching or burning? My issue could be coincidence or perhaps irritation from soap for all I know. He really doesn't think it's anything other than dry skin, but peeling skin on a penis seems out of place to me.I am also concerned that if it is yeast, he has some sort of underlying issue since male yeast infections are supposed to be rare.",
