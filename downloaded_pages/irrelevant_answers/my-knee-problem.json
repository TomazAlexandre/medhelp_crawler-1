            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well, the first knee could be causing pain due to a cartilage, ligament or a meniscus injury since this happened on using the knee joint. However now since multiple joints are involved, it goes more in favor of associated arthritis. It can be osteoarthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or even reactive arthritis. You would need some tests and X-rays of the joints to diagnose this. The pain in the joints can also be due to overweight, hypothyroidism and diabetes.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult yur orthopedic specialist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
