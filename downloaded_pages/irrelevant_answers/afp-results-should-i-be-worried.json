            "answer": "these tests are not accurate (meaning that if they are lower, no need to worry).\u00a0\u00a0you are in the normal range, so don't worry.\u00a0\u00a0i got results of 1:39 downs at age 34.\u00a0\u00a0my daughter is graduating from kindergarten next week, and she doesn't have downs, or any other problems.\u00a0\u00a0i think with the blood tests good, and the nuchal translucency good, you shouldnt' worry.\u00a0\u00a0i declined amnio and worried my butt off for five months! but risks from amnio are 1:200 so you have to balance your need to know against the odds.\u00a0\u00a0those odds are currently in your favor.\u00a0\u00a0good luck!",

            "answer": "The triple screen measures not only AFP, but beta-hCG and unconjugated estriol (uE3) as well. This test is more accurate and screens for additional genetic problems, and is beginning to replace the standard AFP. Generally speaking, any combination of the testing will identify 60% of the babies with Down Syndrome and 80-90% of the babies with neural tube defects.In addition to the substances screened in the triple screen, the quad screen checks the level of the hormone inhibin A as well. The penta screen looks for those four substances as well as Invasive Trophoblast Antigen (ITA). Which screening test you have will depend on which lab is available to you. If you also had the first trimester screening along with the nuchal fold translucency ultrasounds, it is recommended that you use the same lab.The controversy in these tests lies in many places. One of which is the accuracy of the screenings. While some claim that they have only a 5% \"false positive\" rate, most research finds that there are 80+% rate of positive tests while the baby is unaffected. The false positive rates depend on many factors, including appropriate gestational age, maternal age, weight and the presence of diabetes.",
