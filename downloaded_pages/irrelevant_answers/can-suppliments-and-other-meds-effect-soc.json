            "answer": "Hi Deb,The SOC (Standard Of Care) refers to the minimum level of care a patient is entitled to by the health care industry. For Hep C, this currently consists of some form of interferon combined with the drug ribavirin. However, a doctor isn\u2019t necessarily restricted by SOC; he can *add* to it if he feels it\u2019s in the patient\u2019s best interest.Best,Bill",

When I spoke to the Hepatologist, he verbally suggested \u201ctaking it two years\u201d, which I assumed to mean two calendar years. About a week later, I received a copy of the clinical notes from the meeting, in which he dictated \u201cI\u2019d be in favor of the patient continuing treatment for an additional 24 weeks\u201d, which translates into a total of 96 weeks, or two eleven-month treatment years, sort of :o). I probably won\u2019t split hairs with him; nothing to base it on. As it is right now, I have no science supporting me; I\u2019m just running on intuitive speculation at this point.Have you made any progress addressing DM lately? Living on twigs and roots like me (no roots, BTW; too many carbs)?Thanks for asking, my friend\u2014Bill",

Some take imitrex or fiorcet w/ codiene like me. These aren't so harsh on the liver I am told. I would keep in reserve, if needed. Steriods are really not good on tx. I understand you have RA. Is this for the RA?\u00a0\u00a0I had terrible bone pain during tx and severe migraines, especially with the Neulasta. Hopefully you can avoid that drug!\u00a0\u00a0I was in so much pain, my hemo gave me steroids for a short time. It reduces the amount of interferon you get into your system, so if possible, I would try to NOT take it, or take more interferon. Especially at the beginning of tx. You need to rid yourself of the virus and vl, before you start taking steroids IMO.\u00a0\u00a0I am saying this as I didn't clear at week 12. Possibly, I would have, if not for the steroids. Is there a way you can not take them for a while?Of course, your body and system could handle them both fine.

            "answer": "Have you considered insulin? I use it and am tightly controlled - A1c is 4.2.I have heard people say that \"I'm not so bad that I have to take insulin\" to which I generally respond \"how's your glucose level?\". Although in this country diabetes seems often defined as good or bad by whether or not one takes insulin I think of it solely in terms of glucose control. I was on oral meds and I wasn't out of range but when I was on the endless TX road I was nauseas a lot of the time and simply couldn't eat. I asked my doctor if I could shoot some insulin and eat a donut in the morning and he said that would be alright. I never had a weight problem so obesity wasn't a factor in my diabetes. I too think HCV and the bolus steroid treatments I took for organ rejection caused my diabetes. To make a long story short after long consideration and discussions with my doctors I decided to use insulin exclusively for my glucose control.Anyway, with insulin I can pretty much eat what I want and cover with Humalog which is a fast acting and fast clearing insulin. It acts like a normal person's bolus insulin acts when they ingest carbohydrates. It starts working in about 15 minutes and stops in about 2 hours or less. I have been in fancy restaurants and after I ordered I would spread my shirt buttons and slip the needle of my injection pen into my stomach and pump in the appropriate amount to cover my meal. It takes seconds and I'm ready to eat. I looked at all of the available meds for diabetes and when I considered the side effect profiles and the fact that many of the oral meds lose effectiveness over time I chose insulin. I also brought up with my doctors the idea that being a transplant recipient I wondered whether the oral meds which either stimulate the pancreas or inhibit the liver or both might not be the best choice for me. They tended to agree that insulin was a safe approach. I don't own any insulin stock so I am not trying to push insulin for an other reason than it is simple, the dose is easily adjustable according to carb intake and it controls blood sugar extremely well. I am sure you realize that an A1c of 8.4 is way out of line. Poor blood sugar control leads the dangerous conditions which we want so desperately to avoid. You know the risks and they are not worth tempting. If you can achieve a good and healthy glucose level with diet and exercise and oral meds I think that's great. But, if you can't or aren't then I would consider insulin as a viable approach. I hope that you get this issue under control soon. Good luck, Mike",

Around\u00a0\u00a0tx#2\u00a0\u00a0managed to get a1c to 6.3, but think tx influenced that.\u00a0\u00a0Now, 6 months post, we have an unobstructed view.\u00a0\u00a0So, I'll continue the diet focus and see what the metoformin can do.\u00a0\u00a0If it comes to insulin, I can deal with that now that there is a reason to view a wider, longer horizon.\u00a0\u00a0 By the way, 6 month pcr is back and I am svr.

            "answer": "That is really wonderful news my Friend. Congratulations!!!Yes, I would never trust an HbA1c while taking ribavirin. Early in my first treatment I had an A1c of 2.4. After thinking long and hard about it I surmised that the premature destruction of red blood cells invalidated that number. The lab was looking at RBCs that were perhaps 30 to 45 days old while assuming that they were 90 to 120 days old and thus the A1c extrapolation was based of a false assumption. I didn't find any supporting literature for this theory for a year or longer but finally it started to trickle out and I believe that now most informed practitioners know this and realize that HbA1c while a person is treating is likely to be inaccurately low. I know that, though I was controlled during treatment, I certainly wasn't anywhere near 2.7.I think Metformin is a good choice. I know people who control their glucose very well with this drug.The pharmacologic mechanism is different from most diabetes drugs.\"Metformin decreases hepatic glucose production, decreases intestinal absorption of glucose, and improves insulin sensitivity by increasing peripheral glucose uptake and utilization. Unlike sulfonylureas, Metformin does not produce hypoglycemia in either patients with type 2 diabetes or normal subjects (except in special circumstances, see PRECAUTIONS) and does not cause hyperinsulinemia. With Metformin therapy, insulin secretion remains unchanged while fasting insulin levels and day-long plasma insulin response may actually decrease.\"From: http://www.drugs.com/pro/metformin.htmlI like insulin because I like the freedom it allows me when deciding what to eat - and how much to eat. It's a lazy man's approach really because, aside from the injection part, there is little else involved. If I don't want to eat I don't and I don't use any insulin. If I want to eat light I use none or very little. And if, like 30 minutes ago, I want to eat a turkey sandwich with fires and gravy I adjust the dose up to cover it. It's probably not the smartest approach to overall health but at least I do have very tight control over my blood sugar. I really don't eat like that often but once in a while I get the urge.Once again, congratulations on your SVR and good luck with the other stuff too. I am really happy for you.Mike",
