            "answer": "Oh, and yes, I agree with what borninquisitive said; if you press on them too much they WILL stay aggitated.\u00a0\u00a0I got into the habit of pressing and rubbing my prominent one without realizing it, while I would sit rubbing my neck or something like that, and I was really doing it a lot one day and it started to get tender and swollen and a bit sore.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped and within a day or two it had gone completely back to normal.Just leave them alone for a while and don't rub them so hard TRYING to feel a problem.",

            "answer": "look just get them checked out! I have constant swollen lymphnodes which are more serious than I thought, I ended up in hospital with a fever and was told I had streptococcus or strep throat which turned out infact a lot more serious for me, my doctor told me it was tonsillitis but I changed doctor and within minutes she asked to do a hiv test on me which turned out to be positive less than 2 weeks ago, now I have to deal with that, but swollen lymph nodes can be a little more dangerous than people realize! all I can say is get them checked and push for tests, read up on the causes of swollen lymphs and you may find the answer you are looking for!sorry I don't mean to frighten you but this is how it all turned out for me and I had noticed them there for a while thinking they were nothing but harmless glands, how wrong I was! hope it all goes well for you!",

    "question": "I am a twenty year old woman from New York. For at least the last few months I have had an eraser sized bump on the back of my neck down, a little, and to the right of my ear, only on the left side (my GP believes it is a lymph node). Today, I touched under my chin and noticed the lymph nodes there are also eraser sized.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor did not believe the one on the back of my neck was a problem, because it has not grown and is not discolored or sore. It also does not throb or move.I am beginning to get concerned because while the node on the back of my neck has stayed the same size, it has not gone away.I have type one diabetes (my specialist is comfortable with my control; I rarely have a BG\u00a0\u00a0over 225), an anxiety disorder (which I take Paxil CR for), I have had mono, and I am a smoker (about a pack a day). I also get migraines, and lately have been random getting chills. For years, I have also gotten what I call",
