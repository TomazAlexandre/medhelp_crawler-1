            "answer": "First, you can't be overweight and have a BMI of 2.75, that would be like skin and no bones. Overweight is 25-29.9 and obesity above 30. Smack dab in the middle of normal is 21.5. Secondly, what makes you think you have MODY/LADA/type 1.5?\u00a0\u00a0Are you experiencing lows? I ask because your A1c implies type 2 diabetes 120-131 mg/dl.If you wish to be certain ask your doctor for the following:1.) MODY - There are 6 different types of MODY genes and not all tests verify MODY.2. A C-Peptide test. This test measures residual beta cell functions by determining the amount of insulin secretion [C-Peptide]. LADA/MODY/Type 1.5 people have their beta cells destroyed by their immune system. If you are insulin resistant or t2 diabetic, in most cases but not always, your C-Peptide will be high.3. There are other tests that will verify type 1 such as ICA [Islet Cell Antibodies], GAD [Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase] Antibodies, and IAA [or Insulin Antibodies].",

    "question": "Hi. I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was 22 years old. In the beginning, I used insulin for almost 3 years. Then I realized I can control it with oral drugs, so I changed insuline to actoplus and metformin 15/850 twice a day. Now, my A1C has been keeping at range 5.8-6.2 for the past 2 years. I read some paper about MODY a few days ago. Now I am worrying about if I have MODY. I am 29 now. I am the only one with diabetes in my family history. I am overweighted and my BMI is 2.75. Both actoplus and metformin work very well for me. Will you please give me any advice if I should go to do MODY tests? Thank you for your any help.",
