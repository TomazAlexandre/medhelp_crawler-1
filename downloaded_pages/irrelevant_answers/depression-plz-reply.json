I started \"letters to baby\" when I was going through a tough time, and it made me happy to tell her in words how no matter what, she was the best thing to happen to me. Even when I was sad, writing to her lifted my spirits ;)",

    "question": "I can probably count on my fingers the number of days i HAVEN'T cried during this pregnancy. My fianc\u00e9 is usually the cause of it whether it be his fault out not. And on top of it I just found out I'm anemic and might have gestational diabetes. I feel so stressed. I started crying because i was having a hard time backing out of a very tight space in a very small parking lot(i have terrible depth perception). I feel like I'm the worst girlfriend in the world because i have no desire to have sex with him, and i can't just do it because he wants to because then it hurts. and he feels like I'm repulsed by him because of it. idk what to do. I'm so sad",
