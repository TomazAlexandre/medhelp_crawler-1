            "answer": "I am currently 31 weeks and going through this right now. My specialist said it is concerning but it is okay as long as it isn't underived the 10%. I am in restrictions and to eat more which is so hard with my gallbladder disease and gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the perinatologist\u00a0\u00a0(however it is spelled. Aka baby specialist ) told me that those tests are not all that accurate when you are not at least 28 weeks. It is really hard to see the baby. I hope this helps. They should do another one in 4 to 5 weeks to see if there is a change. Good luck and try not to stress.",

            "answer": "Try your best not to stress yourself out. I had a growth restricted baby. They found my stomach was too small at 31 weeks and eventually realised she was under the 3rd percentile for height and weight. they planned an induction at 48 weeks but I went I to Labour the day before anyway. Babies sometimes grow better outside the uterus for whatever reason. They may monitor the growth and if they decide it isn't adequate they might do a c section and your baby will hopefully grow even better on the outside. Be positive!",

    "question": "Hi all, I was sent for a growth and doppler scan last week and was told that it looks like baby is under the 5TH percentile, at 25 weeks. I'm waiting on the final results, and of the doppler, which my midwife should get today. I'm getting a bit anxious waiting. Has any one else got any experience with this?",
