            "answer": "Hi, that is actually the best question to understand!\u00a0\u00a0We talk about the myelin, but it is what the \"myelin covers\" that is what is really important.\u00a0\u00a0The axon is the long nerve that actually carries the signal to and from the body.\u00a0\u00a0The myelin is just the fatty white covering that insulates the axon.\u00a0\u00a0This insulation of the myelin allows the signal to travel very fast and not lose strength.\u00a0\u00a0Some axons travel all the way from the spine to the tip of the toes. (It's how we \"know\" when we stub our toes!)When the myelin is permanently damaged, or the cell that maintains the myelin (called the oligodendrocyte) is permanently damaged, the axon also suffers and can eventually die.\u00a0\u00a0Once the axon dies there is no repairing it.A very nice dicscussion of this is on the site below.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend that EVERYONE read this section about the anatomy of the nerves in the CNS.\u00a0\u00a0It is much better written than I ever could and it will help you understand the stuff we talk about here.http://www.mult-sclerosis.org/howms.htmlAxon loss is the permanent loss of the part of the nerve that communicates to and from the body.\u00a0\u00a0It is bad news.\u00a0\u00a0Q",

            "answer": "Hi Quix,\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much! My Emg report reads like this -- 'A sensory motor peripheral polyneuropathy was seen. Predominantly axon loss in type and moderate degree electrically. This has shown signs of progression since previous study of bilateral lower extremities.'I was trying to completely understand what this meant. I know I have nerve damage to my legs.(not for anyone to this its from MS, my Neuro says its from the diabetes)Jazzy",

            "answer": "My research showed that the lack of sural response that my emg showed was axon loss for the calf area of the leg (I also had no calf deep tendon reflexes) but for some reason when I was reading this I thought they meant it was caused by\u00a0\u00a0calf trauma or injury so I had assumed the causation was not releated to my \"demylenation disease\" found on the mri.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, I've had no calf trauma.moeck",
