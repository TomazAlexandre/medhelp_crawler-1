            "answer": "I absolutely agree with Sally. You say very little about what your husband's treatment regimen is, but whatever it is, it's not working and 20 (360) is in the danger zonez Does he take basal (long-acting) and bolus (fast-acting for meals) insulins? Does he determine his bolus dose by an insulin:carb ratio? This is the standard of care for insulin dependent diabetics. Unfortunately most PCPs and even some endos are incredibly behind the times in prescribing set doses or sliding scales or older forms of insulin. I recommend the book Using Insulin by John Walsh in addition to seeing an endo and working out what to do to stabilize his blood sugar.",
