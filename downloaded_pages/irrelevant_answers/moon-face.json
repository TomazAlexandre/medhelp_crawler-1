            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. If you have moon face and are overweight then you must consult your doctor to rule out the following: anemia, adrenal gland problems like Cushing\u2019s disease and syndrome, diabetes, hormonal imbalance of menopause and hypothyroidism. In all probability you suffer from one of these too apart from lupus. Lupus alone is unlikely to cause weight issues and moon face unless they are caused by steroid therapy (if you are on them). If this is the case then your doctor could slowly taper you off the steroids and start some other type of medication. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
