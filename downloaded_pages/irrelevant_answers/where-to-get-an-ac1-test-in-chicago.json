            "answer": "Check with a local hospital. In my area blood tests are available for reasonable fees. You may need to get another doctor! When it comes to your personal health you need to be the one to take charge! I've had my share of \"less than best\" doctors! Also you can buy blood glucose monitors at a very resonable cost. Testing should be done about two hours after meals also.",

    "question": "I am looking for a place to have an AC1 test done.\u00a0\u00a0My Primary Care physician believes I don't need one and will not authorize it - she said my last test level just wasn't high enough to warrant a test (115).\u00a0\u00a0However, I have all warning signs of diabetes - so many.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested for brain and nerve issues, had other blood work done, all showing no brain or nervous system abnormalities nor hormone or vitamin deficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0However, the list of complaints that initially brought me into the doc's office are still occurring.\u00a0\u00a0By this I mean the urination, numbness, slow healing cuts. fatigue, thirst, cranky mood, etc.BOTH of my parents, all of their siblings and two of my grandparents have/had diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am not very overweight (140lbs/5'5\") and am good health otherwise.I'd just like to have the test done to confirm if or if I don't have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Where can I go in the Chicago-area (preferably downtown) for a AC1 test?",
