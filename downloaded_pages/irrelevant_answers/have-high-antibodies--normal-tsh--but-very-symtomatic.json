            "answer": "once you have been diagnoised with thyroid problems you shouldn't be taken off the medicine for your entire life. Ask the Dr. if they did the expensive test.(he should know what that means) Most insurance companies detor doctors from doing that test because of cost more but it is the most accurate test to do. If he doesn't cooperate, Get a new Doctor. Thyroid problems is nothing to mess with\u00a0\u00a0or brush off!",

            "answer": "Your TSH is very good and doctors normally won't treat with such a good TSH level. What was your FTs? They might relate to hashi. Your antibodies arn't all that high considering I've seen them in the 1000's. Antibodies are seen in other thyroid conditions, other autoimmune disorders and in people with healthy thyroids.\u00a0\u00a0There is no cure or treatment for antibodies.Other test such as T3U with FT-4, can confirm thyroid problems.However,some thyroid problems will correct themselves (lucky lady! if this is your case). However I would suggest being tested on a regular bases for just incase your issue returns.Have you had a complete blood and urine work up to rule out other health issues. A lot of health conditions share some of the thyroid symptoms (too long of a list to post) and its hard for the doctor to distinguish without further in depth testing of other health issues.Keep going to the doctors until you find a solution to all your issues.Good Luck and Feel Better Soon.",

            "answer": "What are the symptoms you're experiencing and are they the same as when you went on the Synthroid?Sometimes symptoms present before lab's confirm a diagnosis.There are alos other illnesses that reflect similar symptoms to low thyroid function.\u00a0\u00a0One of those is a low Ferritin and you might want to have your doctor look into that test.",

            "answer": "Thank you all for the advice. To answer some of your questions, here are the other lab results (much different from last year and from a few months ago):T4: 8.9 (normal 4.5-12.0)T3 uptake: 30.6 (normal 24.3%-39%)FT4: 1.25 (normal 0.93-1.7)Free T4 index: 2.7 (normal 1.1-4.5)T3, Total: 100 (normal 80-200)So right now, their all normal, but I don't feel normal. I feel fatigued (but not as bad as I used to be), have dry hair and skin, bad acne, cold all of the time, bad memory concentration, weight gain/inability to lose weight, heavier periods, high diastolic blood pressure, and slight depression (though not right now). Everyone has been telling me that I don't look good.",

Thanks for bringing that up. I think you actually may be on to something. The problem is that I don't have insurance so whatever testing I get will have to be paid out of pocket :( You're right--endo problems are just a bundle of joy!",

            "answer": "I'm not sure what pharmacies you have near you but the Rite Aid and Walgreens here have low-cost generic (store brand) glucose meters.\u00a0\u00a0You don't need an Rx to buy them which is good because you don't need a diabetes diagnosis when you go shopping for insurance.Test your blood when you first wake up, before meals, after meals, and if you start feeling foggy or dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally your glucose levels should stay between 80 and 140.\u00a0\u00a0If they dip lower or go higher put yourself on the diabetic diet: http://www.eatright.org/cps/rde/xchg/ada/hs.xsl/nutrition.htmlhttp://www.diabetes.org/nutrition-and-recipes/nutrition/overview.jspThe diet is very healthy and, if nothing else, will knock off a few pounds.

    "question": "I'm a 23 year old female with thyroid issues! There's a family hx of thyroid disorders--maternal grandfather had thyroid removed, mother had storm in her 30's and ended up in ICU then had radiation tx and has been hypo ever since, both siters are hypo. Last year, I was extremely fatigued, had cold intolorance, very dry skin to the point of being itchy, dry hair, joint/muscle aches, mild depression,20 lb. weight gain over about 3-4\u00a0\u00a0months (and it stayed put!), heavier periods,terrible memory and difficulty concentrating, and terrible acne, etc. My TSH was 8.665 so I was taking synthroid--25 micrograms every other day. My TSH dropped to 2.246 .I was feeling great on synthroid, but was taken off to have thyroid scan done in May. My TSH was tested a week later and it was 3.232, so I wasn't given meds. All of my symtoms came back and I saw and endo in July who checked antibodies (but not TSH).Antimicrosomal was 88 (normal range 0-34)Antithyroglobulan was 299 (normal range 0-40)I wasn't called about the results, but found out because I requested my chart since all of my symtoms were getting worse. Recently, since I haven't felt good, I went to a Dr. who wouldn't test antibodies, but tested TSH and it's 1.682(the best it's ever been) but I feel terrible. I just want to feel better. What is going on with me? Is it Hashimoto's or not? Is there anything I can do to feel better? Can I be treated with such a normal TSH?",
