            "answer": "Hi BamaBelle,You seem to be very observant about your responses and patterns to your meds, and so I'd encourage you to trust your instincts here.While insulin allergies are not common, plenty of folks have them.\u00a0\u00a0Folks may not be allergic to the insulin per se, but they may be allergic to the buffering agent or preservative or some other component in the vial of insulin.I used this site to read about possible side-effects of insulin aspart (Novolog):http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/uspdi/500253.htmland did find some info on skin changes ..\"Less common or rareDepression of the skin at place of injection;\u00a0\u00a0thickening of the skin at place of injection;\u00a0\u00a0...\"\u00a0\u00a0This doesn't mention cellulite directly, but it sounds similar.The site also has a clear caution to discuss these or any other changes with your doc.\u00a0\u00a0We are not physicians here, so it's important to discuss these ideas with your endocrinologist before making any changes.\u00a0\u00a0In your situation, I'd talk to that doc sooner rather than later.Perhaps you can discuss using Humalog (insulin lispro) instead of Novolog.\u00a0\u00a0It's \"action\" is similar to Novolog.\u00a0\u00a0I'm pretty sure from the way you worded your msg, that you are properly taking your Lantus *separately* from the Novolog.\u00a0\u00a0Good for you.Here's a site with info on Humalog ...http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/medmaster/a697021.htmlLike you, I've had diabetes a while.\u00a0\u00a0It's the diligence that you're showing that allows us to lead a rich, full, long life! Hope this all helps and do check back to let us know how you're doing, okay?",

    "question": "For the past year, I have been taking Novolog Insulin in combination with Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0I have noticed the beginning stages of cellulite around the areas where I give the Novolog injection.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 27 year old, juvenile onset diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I am thin for my height and have never had a problem with cellulite until the change in medication.\u00a0\u00a0Can this be linked to either of the new insulins that I am taking?",
