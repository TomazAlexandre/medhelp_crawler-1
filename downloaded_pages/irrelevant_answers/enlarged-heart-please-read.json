            "answer": "An enlarged heart is just what the name suggests --- portions of the heart are larger than normal due to overworking to compensate for heart desease (e.g., congestive heart failure, propr heart attack). The ventricles thicken or the atria dilate. I have an enlarged atria as a result of high BP over the years and some mitral valve regurgitation. It's easily detected in an x-ray or an echo, both of which you have already had. So your doc would have already detected any sign of enlargement. You appear to have a normal heart. Try not to worry about things that may happen in the future.Best wishesTony",

            "answer": "If you're not feeling well, despite the battery of tests you've gone through, perhaps it means there's something entirely different the matter ... perhaps something not even necessarily all that serious, but chronic and distressing.What that may be is something you'll need to consider carefully, and perhaps it'll mean seeing yet another doctor ... but perhaps a different kind of doc than the heart specialists you've apparently been to. Maybe it would be as simple as seeing your internist or GP again.In my case, my symptoms were all over the map, and often subtle enough that I had doctors dismiss my concerns as \"You're just getting older,\" or worse. In truth, I have Hashimoto's Disease, causing a condition called hypothyroid. Runs in the family, but I wasn't even aware of that fact. Turns out that blood tests (many) spread over a decade all showed it clearly, but the docs never bothered to tell me. Once discovered (by a physician's assistant, who actually LOOKED at the stinkin' blood tests), treatment was thyroid hormone replacement. The synthetic ran about $15 a month, and the (to my way of thinking much better) natural thyroid (derived from pigs) is less than $4 a month.I'm not suggesting you have a thyroid problem, of course, but merely trying to illustrate an example.You may already have the evidence in hand, in all those blood tests. To cite another example, a colleague of mine had cancer. She beat it, but continued feeling awful. Finally, one day she happened to ask her oncologist if -- when she ordered all those blood tests -- they ever tested for blood sugar. \"Sure,\" she was told, but they'd never bothered looking at that. \"Well,\" my friend asked, \"what's my blood sugar at?\" 600, and she was instantly sent to an endocrinologist and put on diabetes treatment. (Bet SHE often thought she might have heart issues too, given all the symptoms of untreated diabetes).Are your symptoms limited to the chest area, and include sharp pains or the like? Could also be such things as muscle strain (yes, this is true!) of the pecs, gas, and similar problems. Again, so long as you can find a doc who won't brush you off as a chronic whiner -- something they did to me, in what I consider blatant malpractice -- if your problem is of this order, it shouldn't be hard to eventually track down.",

Also, I do have fatigue and tiredness, and shortness of breath when I exercise, but I haven't exercised in 4 months, so that could be why. Do i have something to worry about?",

    "question": "Hello, I've been worrying about everything possible lately with my heart. I saw someone on the news had an enlarged heart. I was wondering what this is, and how do you know if you have it? Now, i'm afraid i'll have it. Over the past 4 months, I've had 5 physical exams, chest x-ray, holter, ekg, blood work, and echo. All came back negative but I still don't feel 100 percent and I feel like something is wrong with my heart, now I think its an enlarged heart. Please help with any helpful information!",
