            "answer": "You can eat a snack between meals but not before testing your sugar level cause it will give you an inaccurate reading. You test your sugar first thing when you wake up or before eating breakfast. Then it's supposed to be 2 hours after you've finished each of your meals throughout the day. But for snacks I would stick to veggies cause carbs, sugars, and fruits will raise your sugars higher than it needs to be. If you are also having a hard time controlling your sugar, let your doctor know so that they can either start you on meds or adjust them accordingly. I'm a type 2 diabetic and 34 weeks pregnant so I've been dealing with this my entire pregnancy. I usually don't eat snacks because it puts my sugars too high, I instead will eat heavier protein meals to make me feel fuller throughout the day.",
