            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The white bumps that bleed on scratching could be genital herpes or warts. Please ask your gynecologist to take a look.If you have generalized stomach pains with stool problem then it could be IBS or gluten intolerance.Hypothyroidism and diabetes are the other possibilities that cause most of your symptoms.Please discuss this with your doctor. If possible take a second opinion. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Well I know its not warts because my bf doesnt have any and they go away and come back all the time, Ive also been with only him for the past year and a bit. I think it may be because I get frequent yeast infections but im not a doctor. Also would hypothyroidism cause weight gain?",

    "question": "Okay so my name is Cait and I am 17 years old. I have been experiencing so many medical problems its rediculous and I have no idea if they are related or not. Well I'll start off with my first symptom. Back about 2 years ago maybe Ive been experiencing Extremely frequent UTI's that turn into kidney infections. Now I have had 3 ultra sounds done because at first they thought I had kidney stones, that turned out to be false because soon after I got a cat scan done that proved it to be wrong, then they thought I had an ovarian cyst because I had been experiencing severe abdominal pain and sometimes it is extremely painful for me to have intercourse but that was apparently false too due to the cat scan. THEN they thought I had gall stones which was also apparently wrong. Now Ive been also experiencing some sever dizzyness as well almost periods of blacking out and also feeling very lightheaded and disconnected from my body aswell as bad back pain and chest pains. I have had a pregnancy test done so I know that it is deffinately not related to that. Ive also been experiencing some discomfort around my labia and have these very small white bumps, if I scratch them they bleed like crazy and have this hard like substance come out. It is slightly itchy at times but for the most part does not cause any pain or irritation.\u00a0\u00a0Ive have had a pap test done some time ago but could not get my results due to the strike in Toronto On.I am worried about my health and I have an idiot for a doctor. I am extremely scared and I dont know what is happening to my body, I feel like im deteriorating.PLEASE HELP!",
