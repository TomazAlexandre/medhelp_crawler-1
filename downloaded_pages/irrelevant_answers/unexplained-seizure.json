            "answer": "First of all, get health insurance!! Find whatever you can. Work benefits? Does your state offer any assistance. I live in Ma and its mandatory to have health insurance, you get fined if you don't and employers must offer it. The state helps to get you health insurance with consideration of your income. If I were you I'd be concerned. You almost had a seizure in the shower! What if you hit or head on the tub or when you were trying to get out? I woke up in the middle of the night, went in the bathroom, and when I fainted I hit my head on the sink, then the bath, then the floor. As you can tell, I have a small bathroom. I could feel bruises around my head but it was so numb they didn't hurt until the next day. I'm not so sure about the blurry vision, so I'm not much help there. Also, I don't know why all the tests were negative if you had a seizure. I developed epilepsy during puberty when my body chemistry changed. Do you think it could be a pre-menopause kind of thing? (I'm only 19 so I don't exactly know when that stuff starts).I also think that seizures can be brought on by other things like hypoglycemia or diabetes, something like that. I know for sure that diabetes can cause vision difficulties. Maybe there's some kind of correlation, just a thought.No advice can replace that of a doctor. I've seen doctors on this website post answers to questions. Try some research from all kinds of web sites and write down questions/symptoms so that when you do go to the doctors you can make the best out of the visit. If you know you'll need more than the usual 15 min appointment, tell the receptionist so you can get more time. Especially since you can't afford to keep going to the doctors without health insurance.Best of Luck.",

            "answer": "Hey my name is Haily. I have had two seizures in the last 4 months. Never had them before in my life but last Saturday was the worst one I've had. Thankfully my mom was at the house but the only things I remember before it happened was washing the conditioner out of my hair and the next my mom is telling me to please look at her that I needed to get dressed because a ambulance was here. My mom found me slumped over my tub and my head on the floor. My knee was scraped really bad and we couldn't figure out why then come to find out my knee went through my shower tub. I came out with a bunch of bruises and a very sore body. I don't understand why this is happening to me. I am on medicine called kepra.. If anyone may know something. Please respond. Thanks for taking the time to read this.",

    "question": "I am a 39 year old woman and generally in good health.\u00a0\u00a0Four days ago, while showering, I became very light headed and began to feel as though I was going to pass out.\u00a0\u00a0I made it out of the shower and to the door to call for help.\u00a0\u00a0My roommate sat me down and I began to seize on my left side for approximately 20 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0I have no recollection of the seizure.\u00a0\u00a0I was taken to the ER where I was given anti seizure meds and had 3 ct scans, an MRI/MRA, EEG and EKG, all which came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologists on call decided to not begin me on meds, but really gave me little information to go on.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, I am currently without health insurance, so my options are limited.Yesterday, my first full day at home, I slept quite a bit and felt otherwise normal.\u00a0\u00a0This morning I awoke with nauesa, which went away after an hour or so and it was replaced with a headache and blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0These were the same symptoms that I had in the hospital shortly after the seizure.\u00a0\u00a0All symptoms are gone, other than the blurry vision, which seems worse in my left eye.Should I be concerned about these symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that I had another seizure in my sleep and awoke with the normal symptoms?",
