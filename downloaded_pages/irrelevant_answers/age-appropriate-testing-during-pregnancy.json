            "answer": "I think it might depend on your ob/gyn office. Some do more tests, others offer the same unless your pregnancy is high risk. However, age itself doesn't usually make you high risk, although your test results might be looked at a little more closely.I just turned 36 and have had the same testings offered that I did before turning 35. My doctor's office no longer does the Triple Screen testing because of the higher rate of false results. They changed to the B.E.S.T. testing, which is supposedly more accurate. Also, the Nuchal Translucency test, which is a newer test. And the cystic fibrosis testing. The tests are offered and explained, however I think they are your option to do or decline, except the basic blood labs which will show any iron deficiencies, etc. Good luck!",

I decided on nuchal translucency scan with the blood test\u00a0\u00a0since that is non invasive and is 98% accurate for downs and tri 18... my risk went from 1 in 306 to 1 in 6101 so it gave me a lot of peace of mind and another chance to see my baby by ultrasound...\u00a0\u00a0I didn't want to do anything else without reason so that is all I decided on doing... good luck",
