            "answer": "Hello and welcome!\u00a0\u00a0I have heard many here talk about John Hopkins, the Mayo clinic, I was to go to Mayo in Rochester on an emergency type basis.\u00a0\u00a0You get as much medical records as you can from your dr's and just show up there and they fit you in their busy schedule. They first do a physical exam and go through your records and then they know what specialty to send you to. I was told it can take anywhere from a day to as many as 30 depending on the diagnosis and treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck with all of this.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted.Spazie Ada",

    "question": "Hello. I'm currently in the process of being tested for MS. I've had blood tests to rule out other diseases, the VEP & BAER tests, and an MRI (no lesions). I'm scheduled for a spinal tap on Monday. My primary symptoms are: tingling hands & feet, tingling/numbness in face, IBD type symptoms (tested neg for Celiac), muscle soreness, weakness and soreness after being exposed to heat, etc..My neurologist has been quick about ordering tests, but MS is not her specialty and she is running on a skeletal staff (no nurses). I'm in Tampa, Florida. How do I go about finding the best MS doctor in my area. The National Society of MS website lists quite a few, but I'd like to start with the best. Also, where are the best places to go nationally?I'm not afraid of getting a diagnosis of MS.....I'm afraid of NOT getting a diagnosis. I have beautiful 1 & 3 year old boys, and I want to feel good for them and start treatment.Thanks for your assistance!Patricia",
