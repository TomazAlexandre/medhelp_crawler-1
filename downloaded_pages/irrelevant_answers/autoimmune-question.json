Friedman, MD, PhD and Winnie Yu Scherer.\"Although the majority of people with Hashimoto's will not develop any other disorders, it's important to know what some of these autoimmune conditions are in case you do start to experience symptoms. Keep in mind, too, that you may be more likely to develop Hashimoto's if you have one of these other conditions.Type 1 diabetesPernicious AnaemiaAddison's DiseaseVitiligoCeliac DiseaseAlopecia AretaSystematic Lupus Erthematosus (SLE)Rheumatoid ArthritisSjogren's SyndromeInflammatory Bowel DiseaseMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\"",

            "answer": "\" If you have one autoimmune disorder, does that predispose you for others?\"Yes, unfortunately it does. If I'm not mistaken, I believe it is said that 50% of people who have been diagnosed with one autoimmune disease have or will have at least one other autoimmune disease. You'd have to double check for me on that statistic though. :)",

            "answer": "Thanks everyone. I needed to double check what I had read. Years ago I was diagnosed with PCOS, and in one of my pregnancies I had gestational diabetes (don't know if that is actually considered autoimmune because it was only during pregnancy?). Lately I started looking at autoimmune disorders because I have been experiencing a lot of joint pain.Red_Star, I am actually thinking perhaps it is Sjogren's Syndrome. As I read the symptoms I realized that a lot of 'little' things that have been bothering me for a few years are symptoms of Sjogren's (dry eyes, dry mouth, etc).I have been diagnosed with treatment resistant depression, ADD, and a recent x ray did show normal signs of wear on my lower spine, and arthritis, though not bad, apparently. I am 43 now and recently recovered from a divorce which really knocked me down. I am trying to 'regain my life' again, and keep running into issues. Everytime I start on an exercise program I get hurt. Last injury was a sprained SI joint which put me in bed for a month. Had to get a cortizone shot eventually. Not sure what direction to take anymore, but still looking and not giving up hope!",
