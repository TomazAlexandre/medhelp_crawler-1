            "answer": "I understand your frustration especially when you feel you\u2019re doing everything right \u2013 diet and exercise. I also understand where the doctor is coming from, but at the same I don\u2019t understand the reasoning behind \u201cI was not able to convince my doctor to educate me or give me more tests.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Here are some links to help educate youself about this disease;http://www.diabetes.org/http://diabetes.emedtv.com/And, I see no negatives with an A1c test at all. At least one sees where their 3 month glucose average lies. Perhaps it\u2019s time to seek another doctor such as an Endocrinologist, a diabetes specialist. Ask for a referral.As far as home testing, this is the key to understanding how foods affect your glucose levels. You test before each meal and 2-3 hours after the meal. Why? Before meals will give you a baseline measurement to go by and 2-3 hours after a meal is when glucose in foods reach their highest levels in your blood stream. Everyone is different. Certain foods may raise one person\u2019s glucose levels and at the same time have zero affect on another person. Read food labels carefully and stay away from refined sugars, bad carbs, and if you consume fruits pay attention as all fruits contain fructose \u2013 fruit sugar. Again, it\u2019s the \u201cthey can but can I eat this\u201d thought period. Once you have obtained the knowledge of what foods you can eat and not eat, your testing will decline to an as needed basis.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your explanation.\u00a0\u00a0It's almost unfair to be diabetic or on a high risk for it.\u00a0\u00a0I will use the monitor as you suggested.\u00a0\u00a0My biggest fear as you mentioned is fruits because I eat two to three of different varieties every day.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately, refined sugar is way too sweet for my taste so I will not even miss it at all. With respect to the doctor, I don't know why she does not seem to care that much.\u00a0\u00a0I did a cholesterol test last fall and came out 190 (HDL 65), then I did one with this BG test and came out 166 (HDL 51).\u00a0\u00a0I thought that drop in HDL should have raised her eye brows but she made no mention of it.\u00a0\u00a0But I am aware and I am taking measures to maintain a good HDL level as it might help with the blood glucose as well.\u00a0\u00a0I will keep you posted when anything new comes up with my BG.",

            "answer": "To lessen and also slow the absorption of fructose into your blood stream eat fruits with foods. Basically, avoid eating fruits by themselves.If you're not comfortable with your doctor, or she doesn't explain things fully to your understanding, you have the right to change doctors. If I ask for a test my doc will send the lab order in asap. If he feels I would be wasting my time and $$ he will explain in full why he feels that way. I never leave his office with unknowns. If at a later time a question pops up in my mind, I can email him and get an answer back within a couple of hours.Proper nutrition, exercise and weight control are the keys in controlling and managing your glucose levels. Stray from one and you stray into dangerous grounds.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Ditto everything waverider says. One additional question comes to mind for me. You say you have never been overweight? How old are you? Do you suffer from high blood pressure and high cholesterol? Is there diabetes in your family? If you are young and thin or average weight it might be worth it to ask for two more tests called c-peptide and GAD65. In brief these two tests will ascertain if you are in fact Type II or LADA, a variation of Type I. There are significant differences in treatment approach even this early in the game",

    "question": "I found out about a month ago that I was 106 mg/dl on a fasting glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0I am still in disbelief as I have been doing almost everything right when it comes to diet and exercise for about seven years now.\u00a0\u00a0I have been in really good shape all along.\u00a0\u00a0Given all these, I was not able to convince my doctor to educate me or give me more tests.\u00a0\u00a0At first she very casually wrote me to lower my sugar intake and maintain my weight.\u00a0\u00a0That was it.\u00a0\u00a0But again there has to be more to it.\u00a0\u00a0I have never been overweight and hardly ever eat junk food and deserts.\u00a0\u00a0After, I asked for OGTT and A1C tests, she said it is better to have a BG monitor at home and check that way with a one line instruction set and she offered to order one for me.\u00a0\u00a0I said ok.\u00a0\u00a0My question - is this a good idea for me or should I chill and check in a year and if it gets any worse then I can get a monitor at home?\u00a0\u00a0because I will go nuts measuring my BG two or three times a day.\u00a0\u00a0What would be the worst case scenario in a year?\u00a0\u00a0Can I go T2 if say I do everything wrong in a year?\u00a0\u00a0Having had no baseline to work from, I really don't know what to make of this number.",
