            "answer": "I'm not sure what you mean by mixing everything together. Do you have a specific question?

A good book to read to learn what you need to know is Using Insulin by John Walsh. If you private message me I'll give you a website where there are lots of Type 1 diabetics and even a special thread for young people.",
