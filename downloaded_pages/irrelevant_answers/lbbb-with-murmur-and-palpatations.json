            "answer": "It seems they should be doing an ECHO at the very least to check the structures of your heart, your ejection fraction, and your valves. I would ask about this. GERD can affect your heart-are you taking anything for it? Also are you on any meds for the diabetes? I hope you have an excellent internist, as you are a complicated pt., and if you are not seeing a board certified cardiologist that you like, find one you do. You deserve to have a complete workup and explanation of your symptoms. Good luck-Debi",

            "answer": "I forgot to mention, I did have an ECHO and it was normal. I am taking omeprazole for GERD and metformin for the diabetes. (I am complicated, aren't I? I have heard that before!)I just switched internists, I hope this one is better. Thank you so much for your response.Julie",

    "question": "In Oct of 2004 I went into the hospital emergency because I was having palpatations every third beat. They were seen on the monitor and on the EKG. They told me they were no big deal, sent me home adn told me to contact my doctor the next day. I had a horrible night and the palpatations didn't stop. I went in to see my regular doctor and he put me on Atenolol. That seemed to work and I have been on it ever since. This was at a particularly stressful time as my husband had cancer and passed away a month later.In 2005 I went to see a different doctor for something else totally unrelated and she asked me if anyone had ever said anything about me having a heart murmur. I had never heard that before, but she said she could hear it.In 2006 I was told I have high blood pressure and was put on lisinopril/hctz.In 2007 I was having a lot shortness of breath. I had a stress test and my heart went into an abnormal rythym and I passed out. I was told I had LBBB and I had an angiogram. The angiogram turned out clear.I still get the shortness of breath and I am tired a LOT. Everyone seems to discount this and says I'm fine.I am 52 yr old female, I have diabetes and GERD. I am 20 lbs overweight but I do 30 minutes of cardio every day. During my workout I get palpatations and sometimes pain and then slow down and it goes away.Is this something I should get looked at further?? What do you think is going on??Thank you so much,Julie",
