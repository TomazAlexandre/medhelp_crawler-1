    "question": "i was infected in March of this year with syphilis and doc diagnosed me secondary stage and got treated with three penicillin shots. i was fine when i went back to the doctor in June and doctor said the titers would take time to go down and also doc said i wasn't contagious. two weeks ago i received oral sex and rimming job from this guy and two weeks after i am anxious about recurring of the syphilis. i see a tiny white pimple on the bottom back of my penis. i am scare! should i go to the ER and get checked up for this? and also another question , do you think even after the successful treatment syphilis stays with in the body and even if i get tested for other blood check ups such as for diabetes or blood pressure, anyone could find out that i was infected with the syphilis in my life? is that true?",
