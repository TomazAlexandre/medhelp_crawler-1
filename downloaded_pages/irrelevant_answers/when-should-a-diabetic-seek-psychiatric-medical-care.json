            "answer": "Sweetie, I'm sorry your family and friends don't understand your feelings. I no how you feel since I suffer from Diabetes type 1 and Depression also. You have to remember stress makes Diabetes worse and it is very OK for you to open up and seek advice on this site. YOU are not going crazy you are just overwhelmed and it hurts when you have family and friends controlling you about what to eat what not to eat, I get that all the time..The mood swings are very normal, I have them daily depending on what my sugar is running. Congrats on becoming a medical student. When I was in school for nursing I had a hard time concentrating also and studying nightly but I made it through. It doesnt hurt to seek counseling to have someone on the outside listen to your feelings. I am in Counseling myself for Depression, severe anxiety, ADHD etc.. You are NOT Psycho sweets, it's all a part of Diabetes..Feel free to write anytime you want to talk. I will answer you anytime I no how you feel. I am 46 and got Diabetes at 38 and now on a pump.I had a hard time concentrating when I worked also because one mint my sugar was 23 then the next 600..It makes it hard to think.God BlessBettyann",

It was good for me to hear how that made you feel (I'm sorry for that), but I hope it makes you feel good that you have helped another person with diabetes avoid feeling the way that your parent made you feel even though we know she meant well.\u00a0\u00a0I have to learn to trust him a little and remember not to embarrass him.",

            "answer": "I agree with you that this is the most important step any parent can take upon dealing with and upbringing a child with a chronic illness. They should make him feel positive and effective in other's life and to enquire him with the same tasks that he gives to other healthy family members .Treating a diabetic or any child with chronic illness like a disabled impacts his life soon and later. He may suffer that in all his life .This may interfere with his ability and desire to perform work and to work for other's sake. it will also cause defects in his physical and psychosocial health.Pessimism, depression, being introvert and being troubled and stressed with any problem are all the consequences of embarrassing a diabetic children with his condition for which he is irresponsible.i hate the word i used to hear so much from my mother\u00a0\u00a0blaming when i get any sort of illness..\" it's you .You don't care about your health and diet. in other times \"is it my fault to consider you as a mature regulating your health affairs???\"....\" U should control your diabetes better, otherwise you 'll suffer much in the future and in early age your health will get poor and poor with bad complications of diabetes\" and she may mention them to me ignoring my feelings and my psychological behavior as a child .She used to repeat them more and more in other occasions and sometimes in instances of family gatherings that she sometimes made me go to an empty corner and cry silently with no desire to speak to others . i know that no one can love a child esp. if chronically ill more than a mother and that she wants to keep her child with a good health with no complications but i think they should a bit care to their child's feelings and emotions not to hurt him with a word insult or embarrass him .Although this may not affect his attitude in his child but surely, it will influence his character and behavior in long run..I 'd like to thank you for being careful and listening to my advice as i consider the problem of dealing with chronically ill child as an ethical dilemma...",

    "question": "I am a type 1 diabetic since i was 5. i am a 20 year old lady. I have no problem dealing with diabetes and its control yet it's mood disturbances and feeling depressed for long time that i suffer much from.i also feel lonely all the time. My mother had been hard with me since my condition started. All she cared about is to urge me to keep my blood sugar controlled by so many ways that hurts me to the extent that she embarrassed me by my situation so many times in front of my relatives or neighborhood without intention. Doing that she aims to keep me safe and healthy without giving little care to my psychology and feelings.She rarely listens to my feelings and understands my mood swings or even accept them. So many times she used to speak to me harshly to urge me to control my diabetes.She never listens to me when i get depressed and need someone to express my feelings and speak for.This influenced my character so far even when i deal with all people that i feared them much.I always make a gap between me and other people even the closest to me:my friends & my sisters afraid that when i speak to them about my feelings, my weakness, my pain, my mood swings ,my fears about everything and my sense of being alone all the time they will blame it for me and do like my mother used to do when i was young. No one listen or feels me but myself. Really i don't know how to share people with my sensations and feelings.I don't want to annoy someone or even make someone feel apathy for me,so i found it better to keep on just speaking to myself which i feel that it have become so sick of wounds and speaking. I really don't know want to do??...i am confused and everything in my mind is overlapped and this influence my whole life. I can't concentrate on any work i perform even the simplest. I forget to tell you that i am a medical student and this requires me hard effort and struggling overloading my stresses. Lately my problem interferes with my ambitions for future my hopes and my capabilities that made me think that nothing deserve in this life.I really need help please if you can just guide me or tell me what to do because i feel lost in life track and i need someone's advice. I think so many times of seeking psychiatric medical care but should i??have i been psycho or depressed??? thanks for listening to me...i really should have done this longtime ago",
