    "question": "I am concerned about my 69 year old father's symptoms. He has experienced upper back pain for the past eight months and for the past two months has had worsening loss of sensation in his right hand to the extent that he has difficulty writing and drops things.\u00a0\u00a0In the last week this seems to have worsened and he has also experienced altered sensations in his right foot, he states he has the sensation that one leg is shorter than the other. Yesterday he was unable to play golf (which he previously did regularly) because he felt \"unco-ordinated\". I have advised him to attend hospital as i suspect he needs a CT scan. His family doctor (who he attended when he started having altered sensations in his hand) thought this was a trapped nerve and referred him to an orthopedic specialist. can you give any other advice?",
