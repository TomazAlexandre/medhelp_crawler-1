    "question": "I had an MRI in June 2009 that showed Dawson's finger. The radiologist report said it was indicative of MS.My neurologist said it could not be MS because I am 62 yrs old. I had a clear MRI in 2007. Another MRI wasdone Nov 21. I go to the neurologist tomorrow for the results. The first two MRI's were performed because of falls. I am otherwise healthy, no BP meds, no diabetes. Ocassional numbness in my\u00a0\u00a0hands and right arm. Buzzing feeling around the area of my midsection and weakness in my legs I attributed to getting older.\u00a0\u00a0Am I too old to have MS? What do you think?",
