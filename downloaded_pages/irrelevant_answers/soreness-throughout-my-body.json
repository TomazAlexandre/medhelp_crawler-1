            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This could be from sitting in a cramped position for too long. You should get up once in a while and take small walks. It could be due to Vitamin B12 deficiency. Hypothyroidism and diabetes too should be ruled out.It could also be \u2018fibromyalgia\u2019. This is associated with fatigue \u201ca heightened and painful response to gentle touch (allodynia), needle-like tingling of the skin, muscle aches, prolonged muscle spasms, weakness in the limbs, nerve pain, functional bowel disturbances and chronic sleep disturbances.\u201d \u201cAlthough fibromyalgia is classified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain, pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders, neck, low back, hips, or other areas.\u201d Alternatively you should be tested for gout and rheumatoid arthritis.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!Refer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibromyalgia",
