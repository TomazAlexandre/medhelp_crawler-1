            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Pain of carpal tunnel can go up to the arm, all along the course of median nerve. Nerve conduction studies are quite diagnostic. Treatment is usually by splints and steroid injections. Surgery may be required in some cases. Other than this it could also be due to rheumatoid arthritis and gout. If you are a diabetic or have a family history of diabetes, this should be checked as diabetes can cause stiff joints of hand.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

My diagnosis was in 06.\u00a0\u00a0Now just this year my problems became significantly worse with breathlessness, balance problems, vision blurry, mental fog, memory problems, insomnia and many more.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with depression/ anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0My vit D level was low and I was put on prescription Vit d3, but had little improvement.\u00a0\u00a0So after researching I requested the b12 injections, even though my labs were within normal range.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor agreed and wrote rx for me to give myself injections.\u00a0\u00a0 After my 3rd or 4th injection my neuropathy symptoms were completely gone and have been for over 2 mos. now.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I am still suffering from fatigue and some other problems, but the breathlessness and all the burning, tingling, numbness and pain that i suffered for years is completely gone!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0You need to research b12, b1, b6 and read about malabsorbtion and why taking b12 oral supplements will not help.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is like a miracle vitamin for me and I will never be without it again.\u00a0\u00a0 Please insist that your doc checks your b12 and that he does a B Serum and MMA test to get the most accurate reading of your levels.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Good luck~",

These pains are not muscular or bone related as I have no problem lifting or using arm in any way.\u00a0\u00a0These problems started about 4 months ago after a cruise holiday which I returned with a bad cold and had been feeling very cold for the whole holiday. I have the usual symptms for CTS ie numbness and tingling in index finger and thumb. These symptoms occured in right hand and at the same time I experienced stiffness in feet and a certain weekness in legs though not delibitating in any way, I also feel more tired than usual\u00a0\u00a0Can't get my head around it.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
