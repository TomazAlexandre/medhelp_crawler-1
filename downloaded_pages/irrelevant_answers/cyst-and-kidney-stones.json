            "answer": "She has a large cyst that can be isolated and resolve but needs monitoring, with irregular menses she is now being treated with an oral contraceptive that has a good effect on irregular hormonal balance. Give it a few months to reassess by ultrasound unless she is still having pain at which time she needs immediate help.She should be seeing an obgyn who is comfortable with metabolic syndrome and adolescents.Or she can see an endocrinologist.CT scan is helpful in assessing for calcifications and suspicious masses but no imaging study is fully diagnostic of cancer rather this would be a biopsy-which she does not need.Work with her obgyn or her pediatrician and see if she needs an endocrinolgist to evaluate her other hormones to see if she is having signs of metabolic syndrome, often termed under the broad title in girls as \"polycystic ovarian syndrome\"Those women with family history of type 2 diabetes, those that are overweight and have insulin resistance, hypertension are at risk",
