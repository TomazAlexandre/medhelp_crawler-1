            "answer": "With one blood test several tests can be run. The first gave your results as of the time the blood was taken. The A!C tet that was run seperatly shows the average of 3 months. Therefore giving the two seperate results. As long as you have annual checkups, I wouldn't be too worried about it, unless you come up with sudden symptoms. Check out diabetes symptoms online, and just keep yourself aware of what your body is telling you.",

            "answer": "My doc relies on the A1C test as being far more accurate than the fasting blood test.\u00a0\u00a0It is done every three months and is able to give an average of blood glucose during that time.\u00a0\u00a0The fasting blood test and home tests only show the results for the time you actually do the test.\"How does the A1C test look backward? Suppose your blood sugar was high last week. What happened? More glucose hooked up (glycated) with your hemoglobin. This week, your blood glucose is back under control. Still, your red blood cells carry the 'memory' of last week's high blood glucose in the form of more A1C.This record changes as old red blood cells in your body die and new red blood cells (with fresh hemoglobin) replace them. The amount of A1C in your blood reflects blood sugar control for the past 120 days, or the lifespan of a red blood cell.\"If you doc is not concerned with the 6%, then I would wait until next year.\u00a0\u00a0Do watch for signs of diabetes, tho.\u00a0\u00a0Everything I have read puts a 6% as being on the high side.\u00a0\u00a0My doc wants mine lower.",

    "question": "A fasting blood test taken during my physical last week came back at 104 mg/dl. The nurse also said that my A1C was 6%, which represents a 2-3 month average blood sugar. How can a single blood test give an average over 2-3 months? The nurse said it wouldn't be considered diabetes or pre-diabetes. Should I have it checked again in the near future, or wait til next year's physical. Any advice would be appreciated.",
