    "question": "I was diagnosed with arrythmias a few years ago and put on 5mg of bisoprolol. I really believe this is directly related to my diabetes. It seems when my A1C rises so does my incidence of arrythimias. My question is just recently I had a pre-ekg done for gall bladder surgery and they found arrythimias (that I already knew); but what was news to me is they also found Bundle Branch Block Right and bradycardia. I know on most days my blood pressure hovers around 125-130/ 70-80, but my pulse seems a little low around 60-65. Sometimes if my blood pressure is higher than normal I noticed that my pulse is still fairly in that range. I have not seen a cardiologist in over a year, but with this new diagnosis is it safe to workout? I love running and lifting very heavy weight 3 to 4 times a week. I don't feel dizzy or short of brreath when I workout, but from time to time I will get these arrythmias the rest of the day following a workout. Maybe I am working out too hard? I consider myself in fairly good shape. Any suggestions? thanks Peter",
