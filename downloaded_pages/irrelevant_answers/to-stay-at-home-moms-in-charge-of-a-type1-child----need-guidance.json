            "answer": "Hello Joe,I am glad it was my day to answer questions!\u00a0\u00a0I happen to be one of those very protective, cautious moms.My son is now 10-1/2.\u00a0\u00a0He was diagnosed at age 3.\u00a0\u00a0(He started the pump a year ago) My daughter (not living with diabetes) is 6-1/2.\u00a0\u00a0The balancing act can be a difficult one.\u00a0\u00a0I know that sometimes my daughter gets jealous because my boy needs this extra care.I will share my feelings and then I will get to support for your wife.I have a major problem with anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0It is very hard even sending my son to school because I am giving up that control, but it gets better as far as the separation.\u00a0\u00a0My heart does jump when my cell phone rings and it is the school, but I deal with it.\u00a0\u00a0I have slept in my son's bed or sometimes in my daughter's room (because hers is closer to my son's than mine and my husband's) on MANY nights.\u00a0\u00a0My husband kept asking me when I was going to come back to our bed.\u00a0\u00a0I think once I told him, \"When they find a CURE!\"There are support groups out there.\u00a0\u00a0Your wife NEEDS to interact with other moms like me who understand her.for legal reasons we cannot post an Answer to their Question on this message board. However, suggest that they navigate to the JDRF Online Diabetes Support Team and ask their Question there.\u00a0\u00a0Give them these navigation instructions for getting an Answer to their Question.Please ask her to fill out the form on the page below.\u00a0\u00a0It does not mean you have to be new to diabetes, but it is a place for one on one email support.\u00a0\u00a0She will be matched up with someone like myself.\u00a0\u00a0I would love to help her.\u00a0\u00a0Also, just being put in touch with your local chapter of JDRF can help.\u00a0\u00a0They have info. on support groups, etc.Visit http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=103451Please urge her to do so.\u00a0\u00a0One on one suppport can help her to feel that she is not alone and possibly another mom (like me) can share with her ideas on how handle certain aspects of her life.(Since my son was diagnosed, he has only been with my parents, at school and at diabetes camp - I understand not wanting to be away from him - your wife just needs support right now to help with her stress and anxiety.)As far as dealing with aspects of \"normal life\", it stopped being normal, I guess you could say, but I will do my best to take care of both of my children to the best of my ability and I feel strongly that in our children's lifetime there will be a CURE or soemthing VERY close to one that will alleviate a lot of anxiety.It has been over 7-1/2 years for us and I know I am nuttier than my husband because I have been around the kids more while he is at work.I urge you to talk to your wife about the online diabetes support team.\u00a0\u00a0If not, you can fill the form out and still receive some individual help.http://www.jdrf.org/index.cfm?page_id=103451I hope that your wife and I get connected through the page above.SS",

            "answer": "I would also likely be labelled as one of those overprotective Mom's.\u00a0\u00a0Our son was diagnosed at 12 months of age and thus the saga began.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't sleep through a night for many years, always testing to ensure that his blood sugar wasn't going too low during the night, he went everywhere with us or we stayed home to ensure his safety, routine and good health.\u00a0\u00a0Our saving grace was having 2 people (my mother and a niece) that we \"trained\" so that eventually as he got a little older we could go out for evenings etc. It was a real treat to have these times although I must admit that sometimes I felt guilty that I got a break from the routine, that our little guy could never take.\u00a0\u00a0Once he was off to school, I lobbied hard and got an Educational Assistant assigned specifically to him who stayed in the classroom, assisted him with blood glucose monitoring and snacks and lunches.\u00a0\u00a0The school was fabulous in supporting our sons health. This really helped me gain a level of comfort when he was out of my sight.\u00a0\u00a0He is now 15 and I still keep close tabs on him and think of him lots through each and every day while he is at school, at a friends or whatever.I think it is only natural for a Mom who is well educated in the importance of good control and routine to take this very seriously, and probably sometimes to the point of it consuming one's own life, but as time goes on, and routine is well established, we Moms might have some more relaxed days.All I can suggest is take each day at a time, appreciate the fact that your child is getting the best care possible and help whenever you can and draw on the support of family or friends who you would feel comfortable spending time with your child.All the best to you.",

            "answer": "I think most mothers of Type I diabetics must fall into that category.\u00a0\u00a0When my daughter was diagnosed at age 7 I never thought we'd get back to any type of normal life and really we haven't, we've just changed our definition of what normal is. I barely remember having any contact with my other daughter for months after Emma was first diagnosed and I know I put a lot of responsiblity on my older daughter that she would not have had if her sister was not a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0It has been 5 years and I can honestly tell you I still only sleep 4-5 hours a night and I work a full time 9-5 job outside the home Monday through Friday at a major company.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is my number one priority and everything else comes second.\u00a0\u00a0I stay up until at least 1:00 a.m. every night so that I can check her sugar at 10:00 and then again 2 hours later.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter did go on a pump less than a year ago and this has helped in keeping her sugars under control and has stabalized her to the point that I probably don't need to check her at midnight anymore but, it's tough to let that go.\u00a0\u00a0The few times I have tried to go to bed and not check her at midnight, I wake up at 2 or 3 and can't get back to sleep until I go in and check her.\u00a0\u00a0She is 12 years old now and went on her first sleep over this year, only after she got the pump.\u00a0\u00a0Before that there was no way I'd let her be away from me.It took a huge toll on my mariage initially because I was consumed with keeping her under control, strees and worry.\u00a0\u00a0It's something that just can't be helped.\u00a0\u00a0Your wife understands that at this point in your daughter's life, she is soley responsible for keeping your daughter under control, the stress and anxiety of this can be completely overwhelming.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think my husband really understood how difficult it is to keep a type I diabetic under good control either.\u00a0\u00a0It's a CONSTANT battle.\u00a0\u00a0I did finally have to be away from home on business and my husband HAD to take the control of our daughter's care.\u00a0\u00a0This was before she was on the pump so it was more difficult then.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me leaving her alone with him was probably the hardest thing I had to do but it was also one of the best things.\u00a0\u00a0He failed miserably at keeping her under control and realized how very, very difficult and frustrating this diesease can be.There is really nothing you can say that will make her less stressed at this point.\u00a0\u00a0As things become more routine, that stress level will go down, but never disappear.\u00a0\u00a0Going on a pump will be a big help but initially that too can be very stressful.\u00a0\u00a0It takes some time to get the pump in tune with the diabetic.Please be patient, supportive and understanding.\u00a0\u00a0It will take time, lots of time.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there!",

            "answer": "Joey,I applaud your reaching out for help for your wife.\u00a0\u00a0This indicates to me you care alot about her well being.\u00a0\u00a0Please find ways to help her and your child.\u00a0\u00a0Become involved hour by hour and learn as much as you can about your child and his/her diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You may well have already done this and if so, that is great!\u00a0\u00a0Dig deeper and ask them both questions.\u00a0\u00a0Your child will be happy another adult cares enough to find out what he/she is thinking and feeling.\u00a0\u00a0Your wife will LOVE you for your interest in her and for taking more responsibility for your childs care.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that your wife would be helped tremendously by reaching out to the JDRF Online Support Team.\u00a0\u00a0You would both be put in touch with other parents who truly do understand and whose feet have trod in the same place yours have.I am not a professional, but I feel as though I should be because of my life experience.\u00a0\u00a0My son was one when he was diagnosed and back then, there was little known about infant diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0We trailblazed together and it was very, very rough.\u00a0\u00a0One problem was what was called emotional overlay.\u00a0\u00a0This occured because I had very little support and I was scared out of my mind.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone feels better about the circumstances they are in when they see light at the end of the tunnel no matter how small.\u00a0\u00a0JDRF was there for me then and they helped alot and they will you as well.",
