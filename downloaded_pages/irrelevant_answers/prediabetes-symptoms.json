            "answer": "\"My recent lab shows fasting glucose 109 and trace amount of protein in urine. Are my symptoms related to prediabetes?\"After reviewing your test results did your doctor didn't mention prediabetes or other health concerns? Prediabetes normally occurs when ones fasting glucose falls between 100 and 125 mg/dl. So, yes, your symptoms do mimic prediabetes, including the feeling of dehydration. If you crave for sweets or something salty you'll feel the need to quench your thirst no matter how much you drink. But, and I say but because you may have another disorder causing these symptoms. Has your doctor, or is your doctor, testing you further - checking your thyroid and adrenal glands?\u00a0\u00a0Abnormalities in one or both of these glands can produce symptoms such as yours.Also, he/she can check for dehydration on the basis of physical signs and signs and symptoms such as little or no urination [not in your case], sunken eyes, and skin that lacks its normal elasticity and resilience when pinched. If you're dehydrated, you're also likely to have low blood pressure.For prediabetes pay careful attention to foods that will jack up your blood sugar; foods made with white flour [breads, crackers], white rice, potatoes, and of course sugary foods and drinks. Avoid them at all cost. This will help control and manage your blood sugars.Bottom line, continue to get tested until your doctor verifies the cause. If he/she doesn't feel concerned go find a doctor that does. It took six doctors until I found one that cared about my health.Good luck -",

            "answer": "@Annie -\"Are high triglycerides, high LDL, low HDL, family history considered combo high risk?\"Yes these are. Why it is important to make lifestyle changes preventing the onset of these risk factors. As far as family history goes one can inherit a predisposition to diabetes then something in your environment triggers it - poor eating habits, excess body weight, lack of exercise.\"Is it true that a truly normal A1C reading should be under 5?\"An A1c of 5.09% converts to an estimated daily glucose average of 99 mg/dl. Normal glucose range should be 60/70 to 99 mg/dl. Your A1c of 5.4% equates to 108 mg/dl, what your initial post stated for fasting lab [109]. To lower your levels a little more work is needed.As mentioned earlier, \"Being sick, or having an infection, or having an internal disorder may cause blood sugars to elevate above normal, sometimes very high.\"Pay attention to the type of carbs eaten; avoid simple carbs. Learn about what you can eat by using Google search. eg, search \"potatoes raise blood sugars\".Lastly, stop stressing over diabetes. Stress raises blood sugar levels. Instead concentrate on healthy living.",
