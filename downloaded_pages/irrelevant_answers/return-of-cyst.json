            "answer": "Yes, some women are lucky and go through life having cysts and never knowing, no issues caused (as many women get them due to ovulation etc). However, many women also get cysts, that are troublesome of all sizes, fluid, complex, etc. Some respond to doing BCP or another medication( for the life of me i can not remember what it is, it starts with an \"m\" and I want to say my dr told me its also related to diabetes???), some need surgery.I am one of the (un)lucky ones that have dealt with both. I had 2 cysts each ovary, they were drained april 2010. By end of May I had feeling it was back. Sure enough they were, we tried the birth control approach.. It worked for my left ovary, as long as i was taking it 3 months at a time (and i still take them 3 months at a time).. However, my right ovary didnt respond to that.... And I needed another surgery, where it did unfortunately result in loss of that ovary and tube.hopefully this helps for you. :) I hope youll be one of the lucky women that dont have reoccuring ones, or at worst, can be dealt with via BCP etc",
