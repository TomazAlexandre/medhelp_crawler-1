            "answer": "Hi Snerha - Sorry your having trouble with your vision. Diplopia is a rather broad term which generally just means double vision. It can have lots of different causes.In my case it is caused by MS related nystagmus.The nerves that control my eye muscles send garbled messages. The muscles don;t know what to do and try to make their best guess. While they are determining what to do, my eye(s) bounce rapidly back and forth. This results in double vision. It happens first thing every morning and outside when I get hot and or tired.It seems the key to preventing future occurrences is to try and find out what's causing your symptoms. Have you seen an neurologist that specializes in MS? They are often the ones who can connect the dots.\u00a0\u00a0That's what my MS specialist was able to do.Hope this helps.Kyle",

            "answer": "Hi and welcome to our little corner of the web, i dont think your dealing with an MS related sight issue, but considering double vision is a common sx of MS, i can totally understand how you found your way here. Hope we can be of some help. :-)The most common eye problems for your age group are.....Age-related macular degenerationBlurred vision, image distortion, central scotoma, difficulty readingGlaucomaVisual field loss, blurred vision (late)CataractBlurred vision, glare, monocular diplopiaDiabetic retinopathyBlurred vision, floaters, visual field loss, poor night visionBut I can't see anything specifically within those conditions about eyes actually turning though cranial palsy does include this sx.Cranial nerve palsiesCranial nerve palsies can cause the eyes to look in separate directions, resulting in double vision. These palsies are often caused by diabetes, but can also be the result of a head injury, tumor, multiple sclerosis, meningitis, high blood pressure or an aneurysm. The diplopia is usually resolved when the underlying condition is treated but some people may require additional help such as vision therapy, special eyeglasses or surgery.http://www.eyedoctorguide.com/eye_problems/double_vision_diplopia.htmlI think because your eye(s) actually turn, your possibly talking about 'adult onset strabismus'Strabismus which causes one or both eyes to turn:inward (esotropia or \"crossed eyes\")outward (exotropia or \"wall eyes\")upward (hypertropia)downward (hypotropia)In adults, strabismus is usually caused by:diabeteshead traumastrokebrain tumorother diseases affecting nerves that control eye muscleshttp://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/strabismusThis site here is really good, it has pictures and treatment plans etc http://eyemdsforkids.com/content.asp?sectionID=35605&subsectionID=357584\"Strabismus is a condition in which the eyes are not aligned and point in different directions. This condition affects about 4% of adults.Strabismus may begin in childhood and persist, reoccur, or become symptomatic in adulthood.Strabismus also can result from certain medical problems. Graves' disease (thyroid eye disease), diabetes, strokes, and trauma are some of the more common conditions that can lead to strabismus. Less common causes are diseases that affect the muscles such as myasthenia gravis, demyelinating diseases such as multiple sclerosis, or brain and orbit tumors. Occasionally strabismus can develop after eye surgery, such as cataract, retinal, refractive or glaucoma surgery.\"I hope i haven't confused things too much, lol i still feel i should add that the time frame you've mentioned (November and April) would be timed around the change of seasons and Stabismus can be allergy induced, inflamation etc I think you should actually get your eyes checked out by an opthalmologist to see if there is any underlying conditions. There maybe no connection to your hearing issues, other than coincidental but its still worth getting your sight fully tested.Cheers...........JJ",

            "answer": "Hi Kyle,Thank you for responding to my request.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I've been seeing the top neuro ophtalmologist at Nortwestern University Faculty Medicine for these past two incidents.\u00a0\u00a0He put my health file out on the internet for other neuro ophtalmologists and they can only concur that many people have this problem and they don't know what causes the inflammation of the eye muscle.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholestoral and I am not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I eat healthy and exercise every day.I've thought about the allergy season aspect, but the doctor says no.\u00a0\u00a0I had a slight head cold prior to this last incident and they said that \"maybe\" this onset was caused by the sinus.\u00a0\u00a0If we knew what caused the muscle inflammation I might be able to do something to prevent future incidents.Thank you very much and enjoy your day!Joan",

            "answer": "Hi JJ,Thank you for taking the time to write the extensive reply!\u00a0\u00a0My eyes (and ears) have been tested for everything imaginable.\u00a0\u00a0The first time this happened they put me in a hospital for 5 days and did a spinal tap, an angioplasty (they run a tube into the groin and up to your brain), an arterial biopsy and a couple of MRIs.\u00a0\u00a0I've had and MRI with each episode, except this last one.\u00a0\u00a0The nuero ophthalmologist said there is a new MRI (called CISS) and he didn't want to do it yet, but if my vision is not better by May 7th, he's going to order that test.\u00a0\u00a0My file has been reviewed by some of the top eye and ear specialst around the world.\u00a0\u00a0A specialist I had at Washington University in St. Louis, told me he had a female patient who had 5 of these episodes.\u00a0\u00a0That doctor has since passed away.I have a 2 inch file on optic nerve disorders and cochlear nerves and the possiblity of those being connected, but all I can find is that the medical field does not have enough information (yet) on that part of the brain.\u00a0\u00a0My hearing specialist in St. Louis told me that in 10-15 years from now, they'll be able to restore people's hearing 100%.\u00a0\u00a0Isn't that amazing?!Doctors have ruled out Graves, MS, Diabetes, Stroke and many other diseases for my case.\u00a0\u00a0I've been blessed with patience and I know I'll eventually recover - and if not, I'll get prism glasses.Continue to take good care of yourself and have a great day!Joan",

    "question": "Has anyone had more than 3 episodes of eye diplopia?\u00a0\u00a0I am now encountering my 4th incident.\u00a0\u00a0They always happen the last few days in November or the first few days in April.\u00a0\u00a0This time it started March 20.\u00a0\u00a0They happen only every other year - almost 2 1/2 years apart.Since these episodes started in 2004, my hearing has gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0I started wearing one hearing aid in 2006 and now I wear 2 hearing aids.\u00a0\u00a0Almost all of my cochlear nerves are dead so my hearing loss is unusual and profound.\u00a0\u00a0I've been to many specialsts for both my double vision and my hearing loss and no one will say that there is a connection between the two.I've had double vision once in my left eye and 3 times now in my right eye.\u00a0\u00a0The right eye recovers in 7 weeks (with the eye turned in).\u00a0\u00a0The left eye had turned out and that took 3 months for recovery.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a very healthy 66 year old women and am very active, not overweight at all.\u00a0\u00a0I've never been diagnosed with MS or any other illnesses.Does anyone have any suggestions for preventing future incidents?\u00a0\u00a0I'm told that these occur due to the inflammation of my eye muscle, but they don't know what causes the inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0It does not respond to steriods.",
