            "answer": "Hello!Most of the times this problem goes away on its own. Physical causes are common in older men and emotional causes are common in young men. Poor communication with your partner, stress, fear, anxiety, anger could be few possibilities. Diseases like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions can also lead to improper erection. Take adequate sleep and nutritious diet to ensure good blood supply. Effective communication and a good foreplay can definitely help you overcome this situation. I sincerely hope it helps. If the problem persists seek medical help. Do keep us posted.Take care and good luck!",
