            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Post exercise nausea or Exercise induced nausea and fatigue is usually due to over exercising, or abruptly stopping exercise, or over hydration. Drinking too much water before, during or after exercise could also be the cause. Eat some salty snacks and see if it helps. Exercising on empty stomach which causes blood glucose to dip with exercise can also be the cause. One should exercise after 2 hours of a light meal. Wait for a day and see. If the symptoms persist consult a doctor to look for other causes. Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Take care!",
