How is your A1C?IF your blood sugars are usually high, or if you have neuropathy, it probably a good idea to see your Dr.However, if you don't have neuropathy, and your sugars are well controlled (< 140 nearly all the time, your HBA1C is in the 4 - 6 range), then you may observe.\u00a0\u00a0 Go to the Dr immediately though if you have any redness, pain, abnormal color etc. Foot care is very important for anyone who has diabetes.",

    "question": "I woke up with a blister on my right foot - Not sure if it is diabetes related but I have gotten these on occasion. What causes them (assuming it is diabetes related)? Could it be connected to the BG spike I had yesterday? How should I treat this? I usually pop them and move on but I gather that's not the right thing...I should also confess - I was also diagnosed with an anxiety disorder so I am trying not to go overboard but I want to take good care of myself...",
