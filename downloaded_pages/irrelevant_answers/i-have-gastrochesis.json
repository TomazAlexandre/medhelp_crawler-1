            "answer": "It sounds like you have what I have...gastroparesis. It's basically slow stomach emptying. Your tummy bloats up because the food is backed up in there and I bet when that happens, you have some naseua. I was just asking a question about it on these boards as I saw a surgery called a gastrectomy that 83% of patients found relief after having it done. It's serious surgery though as it's a removal of the stomach and this is actually a study that was done on those who got gastroparesis due to a previous stomach surgery which is what it is in my case. It sounds like yours came on all the sudden and might have been caused by diabetes or it just happened for no reason. I belong to a yahoo group for gastroparesis which you might want to look up and join. I know your pain and I also hold my stomach and don't wear anything tight around my stomach and I don't want to move because of the pain. Your doctor can prescrible motility drugs. I take Reglan which helps, but the FDA just came out with a warning for it. I wish you luck in finding some relief.",
