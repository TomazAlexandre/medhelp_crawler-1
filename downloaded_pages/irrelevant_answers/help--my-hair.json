            "answer": "There are several possibilities for your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Various metabolic and rheumatologic diseases can lead to this.Obtaining blood tests to evaluate for thyroid dysfunction, diabetes, as well as an ANA\u00a0\u00a0level would be a reasonable initial screen.\u00a0\u00a0 The ANA can test for lupus and other rheumatologic conditions.The eye symptoms can be evaluated by a ophthalmologist.If the tests remain negative, and the hair loss continues, a dermatology referral to evaluate the cause is appropriate.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.kevinmd_",

            "answer": "All of your symptoms point to hypothyroidism to me, as I had these symptoms as well.Make sure they're not just running TSH.They should be checking Free T3, Free t4, and both hashis antibodies, Ferritin. Make sure your Free t3 and T4 are both high in the range and you have no antibodies.Beware of synthroid and other synthetic T4 drugs as they can make hair loss MUCH WORSE. I recommend you take Armour thyroid instead, working your way up to a dose of 180-300 mgs, until symptoms subside. A starting dose is 60mgs, and you should raise by 30 mgs every two weeks. the TSH will be next to nothing with you are optimized. Your Free T3 will probably be at the top of the range and Free T4 above midrange when you are feeling normal again.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 29-year-old female with fine, rather thin hair.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past several years I've noticed visible thinning in the front.\u00a0\u00a0There are bald-ish areas, but not round, smooth spots.\u00a0\u00a0I had chalked this up to poor genetics and been too embarrassed to pursue more information.\u00a0\u00a0The thinning has become noticeably more significant over the past several months.\u00a0\u00a0It's not diffuse thinning throughout my head...more concentrated towards the middle of the front.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be something more than bad genes?\u00a0\u00a0 (Please?)I don't know if this is related to it, but I often have dry, flaky or scaly patches on my scalp...but not in the areas where the hair is thinning/falling out.I've noticed that I've been feeling more tired this summer, but it's not a constant all the time fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0I also have frequent sore throats and dry, red itchy eyes which I've attributed to allergies.\u00a0\u00a0There is also a yellowish spot near my right pupil, if that means anything.\u00a0\u00a0I've noticed more frequent carpal tunnel like feelings, and occasional soreness of my feet and ankles (which may have nothing to do with my hair loss).\u00a0\u00a0I have occasionally noticed my hands trembling (generally only slightly), but attributed that to nerves.\u00a0\u00a0I'm generally a laid back person, but have been both \"on edge\" and sorta-depressed more often it seems.\u00a0\u00a0Because of all these and the hair loss I just had my thyroid levels checked.\u00a0\u00a0(Results not back yet.)\u00a0\u00a0Thing is, I can't tell if my symptoms would be more hyper or hypo...and maybe it's neither.\u00a0\u00a0Could the symptoms of either of these have come on so gradually that I didn't notice...and the hair loss started first?Could there be something else causing the problem that I should look in to?\u00a0\u00a0My recent reading up on the internet (granted, not always reliable) has me finally hopeful that I'm not just suffering early genetic hair loss as it seems that \"female pattern baldness\" is more diffuse?",
