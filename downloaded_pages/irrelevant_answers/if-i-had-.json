            "answer": "Alot of people believe that if they just lose weight they could get rid of their diabetes and there are even doctors on tv commercials in my area that stated they have the cure for diabetes but from what I have learned from my diabetes educator is that if you are obese and that your diabetes is coming from obesity you can lose weight and then be able to manage your diabetes with diet and exercise. Then it depends on which type of diabetes you have as to weather it can be controlled with diet and exercise alone. Hope this helped :)",
