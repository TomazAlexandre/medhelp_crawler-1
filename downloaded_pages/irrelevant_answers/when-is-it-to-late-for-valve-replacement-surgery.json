Remember, M.D. does not spell G.O.D.; doctors are people capable of making judgement errors just like the rest of us and new meds and treatments are sometimes hard to keep up with, so to paraphrase Shakespeare, \"get thee to a cardiac specialist STAT!\"\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "Thank you for the opportunity to post here.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with valvular heart disease, dilated cardiomyopathy and CHF about one year ago.\u00a0\u00a0My left ventricle is dilated to 6.2 with hypertrophy, and I also have global hypokinesis.\u00a0\u00a0I have just turned 40.\u00a0\u00a0My EF runs between 35 and 40 according to echo.\u00a0\u00a0I have been told that I cannot have valve replacement.\u00a0\u00a0My condition is maintained by meds. Digoxin, Aldactone, Prinivil and Demadex.\u00a0\u00a0I have three valves that are regurgitant: Mitral-moderate to severe, Aortic-mild, Tricuspid-Moderate.\u00a0\u00a0The valvular disease is primary and the cardiomyopathy is secondary.\u00a0\u00a0I don't understand why I can't have the valves replaced.\u00a0\u00a0Wouldn't that cure my condition?\u00a0\u00a0When is it to late for a replacement?\u00a0\u00a0If I can't have replacement, how long is it before this condition would worsen and I would require possibly a heart transplant?\u00a0\u00a0 Thank you for your time and consideration in answering my questions.",
