            "answer": "I have a family history with diabetes so I got tested early and I'm on a diet and insuline shot since 10 weeks and now 37 weeks. It is really manageable... frustrating at first because you have to watch what you eat, eat regularly and exercice everyday single day to keep your blood sugar under control. Now near the finish line my baby boy is monitor once a week and I had an extra ultrasound at 32 weeks to make sure baby wasn't too big and had the right amount of liquid. Everything was perfect and my doctor ia saying my pregnancy is as normal as can be and baby is super healthy. I had to see a nutritionist which help me a lot. Good luck to you and take one day at a time.",

            "answer": "Try not to worry too much, and don't self blame no matter what the result is. I eat super healthy and have always been normal weight with no history of diabetes and they said I had gestational cause I failed both glucose tests. I was really surprised and hurt, but Dr said placenta was making me have these issues and not to blame myself. I just prick myself 4x a day to test levels and cut wayyy back on carbs to keep levels low. It's temporary, so I can do it and want to keep baby at low risk as possible for diabetes after birth. But try not to worry too much, cause u may pass 3 hour test still.",

Im so nervous, i feel fine, im just confused why this is happening to me. Will it harm my baby? I felt i was doing everything right and now im so upset with myself if the tests do come back that i have gestational diabetes. Is this common? How did you first time mommies cope with this?",
