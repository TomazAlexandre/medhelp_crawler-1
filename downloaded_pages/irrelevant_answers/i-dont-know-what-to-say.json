            "answer": "Hi,I don't know how long you drank and how much but even though you stopped, there may be damage from that or it could be something else. You won't know until they do the test. Try not to worry about it (easy for me to say) until you have some answers. You could drive yourself crazy.Also, there could be a mistake. I have had that happen more than once with blood work and was just recently re-tested for Diabetes as my numbers were off the chart. I am fine--no Diabetes. So that sort of thing does happen.Try and hang in there until you know for sure.",

            "answer": "I will post again after the Ultra Sound. I won't trip too much, because I know how I can over dramatize stuff. By the way, I drank from the ages of 13 until 28. I am now 44 so it has been 16+ years. It is what it is for now and I will keep you posted. I just wondered if anyone else had this issue, and also thanks to these forums for adding to those that said get test done. I would have gone on like this without test had it not been for those who said to go.",

    "question": "I have posted before, and I am posting now becasue of what I just found out. Maybe someone else has been through this and has advice. I was on Norco and soma for 7 months 8 Norco a day along with 2 Soma. Car accident on top of a few other back problems lead me down that path. Withdrawls are over but still not sleeping. It has been over 2 weeks, no Norco/Soma. 7 months of pills was not a long time considering some of the other stories in here. I started working out again last Sunday and feel great. I have been trying to lose weight with litte success, but I know that adding muscle weight can counter act that. I am trying South Beach approach, and drinking lots of water, but the weight is not dropping by much. Stomach pain continues, and as advice from not only this forum, but from family and friends, I had blood work done. Blood work came back today, and Dr. has ordered an immediate ultra sound due to liver inflamation, and damage. My counts are very high, in fact over double what they should be. He asked me if I started drinking again LOL, and I have not had a drink in over 16 years!!!!. There are a few things that it could be, but I have been research the web, and medication can cause what I am going through. I am not jumping to any conclusions. I just want to know if anyone else has been through this or any experiance at all. Also a warning to those who are still fighting the good fight to try to stop. 7 MONTHS people!!!!! if it was the meds that's all it took, 7 MONTHS. I am sure the Dr. will help guide me on the right path, but man I wish I could go back in time now. The road ahead is going to be hard, but I am not putting any more pills into my body!!!!!",
