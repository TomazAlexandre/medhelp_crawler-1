            "answer": "Hi and sorry for the late reply. It could be the other way around. Excess gas in the abdomen can cause the non visualization of common bile duct and pancreas. Bloating can happen with consumption of excess sugars, indigestion and aerophagia. It could also be due to Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS), malabsorption, inflammatory bowel diseases and various infections of the colon. try to avoid sugars and voluntary swallowing of air. Diabetes mellitus can cause autonomic neuropathy and consequent slower motility of the intestinal tract. Medications to promote motility may help in emptying the intestines by promoting motility. So, don't worry and discuss these options with your doctor. Take care. Regards.",

    "question": "I am a 40 yr old male and have had severe bloating for about 7 years. I have tried EVERYTHING with no help. I have also had many tests that revealed nothing. I just had another abdominal ultrasound and the doctor said it was okay. I got the report back and it says \"no visualization of the common bile duct and pancreas due to excessive bowel gas\". Could this be the cause of my bloating? If so what could help. I have tried everything for gas....charcoal, gas-x, aloe vera, probiotics, bitters, digestive enzymes on and on and on. Any help would be greatly appreciated.Thanks.",
