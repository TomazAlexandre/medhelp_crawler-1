    "question": "I had quadruple heart bypass in August 2004. Since that time I am freezing to death. I am cold all the time. I feel like I am sitting in a tub of ice water. I have been to 5 different doctors and none of them can find anything wrong. I have had all kinds of test done and they all came back good. I am 73 years old and have to stay in bed most of the time.Has anyone experience this feeling and what did you do about it?",
