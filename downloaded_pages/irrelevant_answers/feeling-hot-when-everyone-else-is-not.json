            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Underlying infection or inflammation in the body can result in the feeling of heat. Another possibility is hyperthyroidism. Antibiotic or other drug metabolism can also cause a feeling of heat in the body. Drink plenty of fluids, eat lots of fruits and vegetables and take multivitamins. Get your thyroid function assessed. It can also be due to heart problems, especially if you feel suffocated at night.All causes of hyperhydrosis like hyperthyroidism, diabetes, carcinoid syndrome, infections etc should be eliminated. Do consult your doctor. Take care!",
