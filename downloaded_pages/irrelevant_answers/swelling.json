            "answer": "DessaBee,I'm not a physician. I'm a long time diabetic. I'd encourage you to see a doctor right away. What you describe sounds very uncomfortable and it's reasonable to begin to get this checked out. I wonder if this has slowly, gradually gotten worse 'til now it's bothering you enuf to be concerned.As you suggest, you could be retaining water -- that can be from a variety of things including your diet, some interference with sweating, or something awry with your kidneys. It's definitely important to check this out.I realize that a visit to the doc may well cost you a lot. I'm concerned that your not visiting the doc will cost you more :-( Be sure to let the doc know you're \"self pay\" because they will often deeply discount their fees to help you. Many docs also get lots of smaple meds that they might be willing to give a motivated patient that simply cannot afford the Rx.I hope you'll take good care of you. Please check in again -- I'm sure you'll get more replies on this important topic.",
