            "answer": "Hi there. Your child could be having migraines, which are known to occur in the young also. It is possible that she is not able to address these due to anxiety and lack of knowledge. You need to look for and answer certain questions like does she have headaches, how long do the headaches last, how often does she get them, any triggers, the location of pain and the sensation, any associated symptoms like nausea, sensitivity to light etc. your family history of diabetes could be concerning for the child. Get her blood sugar profile done to check if she has diabetes. Her fasting and post prandial blood glucose levels. She could be having raised intracranial pressure since she has unequal pupils, and phasing out. An MRI brain may be required. show her to a pediatrician for assessment. Hope this helps. Take care.",

    "question": "My 12yr old daughter has had about 10 episodes in the last week where she suddenly feels like she is zoning out with her vision, she can walk, talk, hear people talking, but her friend said that at the time, one pupil was very small and one pupil was verly large, and my daughter acted like she couldn't tell where her friend was talking from...when it has happened around me, she says, ok, it's happening, but her pupils look the same, and she just says that things look bigger than they are, and that her peripheral vision is really good..she can see around her.....I don't know if this is related, but she has a lot of diabetes on her grandmother's side (she eats a ton of sweets--not sure if that is related to diabetes), and she sometimes gets headaches (I get hormonal migraines)...Any thoughts or advice??",
