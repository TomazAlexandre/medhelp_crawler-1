Have they tried putting you on medication for Anxiety and see if that helps with your symptoms?If they are concerned about MS, they should order an MRI. I would insist on seeing a Neurologist.",

            "answer": "I've been prescribed xanax and prozac. Xanax helped me very much! When I took a pill, the numbness went away..sometimes totally..other times about 90 percent. My doc says it is addictive and only gave me 8 pills..said I needed to be on something else like prozac. Prozac was not good for me..gave me chest pains and blurry vision. Could not sleep or eat while taking it. I've been afraid to try something else for anxiety after my experience with prozac. Could diabetes be detected from blood tests? I would think I've already been tested for it. I was tested for a myriad of thyroid conditions but all came back fine.",

    "question": "I would love any insight about symptoms I've been dealing with for 6 months. I went through a very stressful two week period in April, during that time my ring and pink finger on my left hand became numb for several hours..then returned to normal. They went numb while on a long stressful drive.A week later, once I was not feeling as stressed..those same fingers went numb again except this time they didn't return to normal. A day later the same two fingers in my right hand went numb.A week later I developed symmetrical numbness in my toes on both feet. I became very scared and went to a GP. She ran many blood tests and called me later that week to say I had a SEVERE Vit D deficiency. She had me take 50k mg once a week. I took my first pill as directed..when I went to bed that night something terrible happened. My left leg started vibrating terribly and my left arm became tingly. I had terrible dreams and could not sleep at all!The next day my left leg was so numb I could barely walk on it! I was in a state of panic. 24 hours later my leg and arm were back to normal. I never took the vitamin d again because of my reaction.I saw a different GP the next week who did more blood tests. She said my Vit D was fine but my B12 was extremely high. I had been taking a daily b12 for a month. She told me to stop taking all vitamins.I saw another doctor for a third opinion. All of them have told I am having vitamin deficiency issues and anxiety.About two months ago I started having shooting pains in my left arm that comes and goes. It happens about one day a week. Aleve does make it go away. I also have this issue in my left leg..it comes and goes..hasn't happened now in about a month.Some days I have tingly feelings in my left leg..some times I have those feeling in my left arm. Each day is different.I have numbness some days on the left side of my buttocks. I had a spot that would come and go about once or twice a week where my buttocks meets my leg. That went away and now it is in the center of my left buttocks..again this comes and goes.I have had some degree of numbness\u00a0\u00a0always symmetrical) in my fingers and toes on both sides for 6 months. There are usually about two days a month where I have no numbness anywhere.The internet leads me to believe I have MS however, no doctor has even tried to send me to a neuro. I worry so much about what is wrong with me..and when I do..my symptoms do get worse. I am wondering if anxiety could be causing all this or if I am truly sick with something such as MS. I did start a stressful job last year..but I've had stressful jobs in the past with no issues like these.Any advice is much appreciated!!!",
