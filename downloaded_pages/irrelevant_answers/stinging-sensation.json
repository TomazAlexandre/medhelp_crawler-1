            "answer": "Hello,Such kind of pain can be due to a pinched nerve or an infection. Other than that it can be a simple bacterial infection or balanitis. Frequent rubbing of clothes on a hypersensitive tip of penis can often keep it stimulated and cause such symptoms. Get yourself tested for diabetes as presence of this can cause mild infection. I advise you to get a STD panel and see if it includes all of these: gonorrhea, chlamydia, mycoplasma, ureaplasma urealyticum, trichomonas, syphilis and herpes).I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Thank you Dr. Singh,I have had this mild stinging sensation for over a year and when my dermatologist examined the area he suggested a pinched nerve.\u00a0\u00a0Normally I have to press on the area to feel the sensation.\u00a0\u00a0 I give blood a few times a year so perhaps some of the STD infections may be ruled out since they screen for some STD's.\u00a0\u00a0Can other infections persist for long periods of time?\u00a0\u00a0I recently took a three week cycle of Doxycycline for an overseas trip, to prevent malaria, would this kill a bacteria infection?\u00a0\u00a0Do you recomend a examination by a Urologist? Thank You!",
