            "answer": "Hello and welcome to the forum.I am sorry to hear about what you have been going through but I am also glad that you are on a good medical regimen and feeling well.\u00a0\u00a0This is critical.Your question is a little tricky for a couple of reasons.\u00a0\u00a0First, many patients are diagnosed with a \"viral cardiomyopathy\" because there is no other apparent reason for the cardiomyopathy/heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes a virus is indeed responsible but for many other cases, the cause is likely unknown or potentially even genetic. But, this is probably not all that important because the reality is that some cardiomyopathies do get better and will even completely reverse.\u00a0\u00a0Others will not imrpove quite as much but as long as the patient is on excellent medical therapy, the condition can remain at bay for quite a long time. Remember, patients with diabetes do not ever truly \"recover\" from their condition but as long as they take their insulin, etc they can live with the diabetes without too many problems...the same can be said for many cardiomyopathies.It sounds like you are committed to doing whatever it takes to ensure for yourself the best chance at a favorable outcome and this is exactly what you need to be doing.\u00a0\u00a0You should live an active, yet healthy lifestyle, take your medications as instructed, follow up with your doctors, and then most importantly, go live your life and enjoy it!!Wishing you only the best,Dr. Rich",

            "answer": "Dr. Rich,Thank you for responding to my question.\u00a0\u00a0It appears that there might be some differences in medical opinions which I'm sure it is not that that uncommon.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad to hear that there are some cardiomyopathies that are reversable.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I will ever be 100% well, but I do think viral cardiomyopathy is at least treatable.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I am lucky to be asymptomatic.\u00a0\u00a0I have just bought a membership to the gym so weather is not a deterrent and I can walk in a climate-controlled environment.\u00a0\u00a0I am determined to shed 64 pounds to reach a healthy weight.\u00a0\u00a0The easier I go on my heart the better right?\u00a0\u00a0Also, I am a firm believer that the heart muscle is just like any other muscle to an extent and if I walk regularly to make my heart muscle stronger then I should see results and those results should show by an increased EF level.\u00a0\u00a0:)In the interim, I have ordered four books on cardiomyopathy so I can educate myself better on my condition.\u00a0\u00a0I think knowledge is power and the more I know about it, the better I can fight it.\u00a0\u00a0Please feel free to tell me if there is something I am missing.\u00a0\u00a0Comments are always welcomed and constructive criticism is always well-taken.",

    "question": "Is viral cardiomyopathy reversible?I am 49 years old and 10 months ago I was diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on medication (beta blockers and ace inhibitors) and my cardiologist has told me I will be on my target dose medication for the rest of my life.\u00a0\u00a0When I was diagnosed with viral cardiomyopathy my EF was 20.\u00a0\u00a0I have dropped some weight and walk every day.\u00a0\u00a0When I was diagnosed was because I landed in the ER as I was short of breath, had an uncontrolable cough, and felt my lungs filled with fluid.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I had pneumonia, but when I got the very unexpected news that it was heart failure I felt like I had been handed a death sentence.\u00a0\u00a0I immediately read about it and was sad to learn about it's high mortality and morbidity rate.\u00a0\u00a0I feel very blessed that I am, besides my cold/flu-like symtoms leading up to my diagnosis, I am pretty asymtomatic.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my question is, if I continue to watch my sodium intake, manage my weight to a healthy weight, and walk an hour and a half a day, is there a possibility that my condition can be reversed?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
