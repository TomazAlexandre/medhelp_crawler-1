I hope this helps you.",

            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The out of body feeling you have is a common symptom of lows.\u00a0\u00a0I'm curious about your pump settings.\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever done basal rate testing?\u00a0\u00a0That would show whether or not you have the right basal rates for different times of the day.\u00a0\u00a0You can test overnight rates or rates across any meal or any part of the day.\u00a0\u00a0You basically start blood sugar testing 4 hours after last eating in order to make sure that your food is digested and through your system, and your fast acting insulin has completed it's work to cover that food.\u00a0\u00a0You test about every 3-4 hours to make sure you're not high or low, and don't eat or drink anything until your test period is over.\u00a0\u00a0For example, if you are testing overnight basals, and you are done eating supper by 7, don't eat anything else and start blood sugar testing at 11.\u00a0\u00a0At breakfast time, your blood sugar should still be within 20 points of where you started at 11 the night before.The reason I'm asking is because I'd guess that your basal rates are off, so that under a normal day you wind up getting too much insulin.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be that your carb ratios are incorrect, so that you don't get enough insulin, then you correct later and you get too much.\u00a0\u00a0Also understand what your insulin duration setting is.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin duration is the time that insulin is effective in your body.\u00a0\u00a0Normal duration for fast acting insulins is 4 hours, after that the effectiveness is almost nothing.\u00a0\u00a0If you have it set to longer than that, it's possible that your pump thinks you have more insulin on board than you really do, so it doesn't dose you enough.\u00a0\u00a0Then if your correction factors are wrong, you get dosed the wrong amounts of insulin, and you go low.\u00a0\u00a0All these could be a factor in your erratic scores.\u00a0\u00a0You really have to dig into your pump settings and understand what each is for and how to tweak things.\u00a0\u00a0A caution, though:\u00a0\u00a0don't tweak more than one setting at a time.\u00a0\u00a0If you tweak too many, you may wind up causing other problems, and you won't know what setting changed caused the problem or fixed the problem.Another possibility is that you are not getting good insulin absortion some of the sites you choose.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't get good absorbtion you will have erratic scores.Yet another possibility is that your estimates for carb counting are off.\u00a0\u00a0Have you considered getting a digital scale to better estimate portions?\u00a0\u00a0Accurate carb countings, along with understanding which foods affect you in which ways, as well as understanding how to subtact off for fibers and portions of sugar alcohols.\u00a0\u00a0I'd suggest working with your endo and a dietician that specializes in diabetes if you're interested in this information.Good luck and let us know if there are any other questions you have.",

I HAVE ASKED THE DOCTORS IF THEY KNOW OF ANY OTHER MEDS THAT CAN HELP, BUT THEY DON'T SEEM TO KNOW OF ANY.MY SISTER ; WHO IS A PHYSICIAN, ORDERED A MED FROM CANADA(CAN'T THINK OF THE NAME RIGHT NOW), BUT IT IS NOT APPROVED BY THE FDA AND HAS BEEN KNOW TO CAUSE PROBLEMS WITH STROKES AND HEART ATTACKS, SO I AM A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO TAKE IT FOR MY GASTROPARESIS.ANY THOUGHTS?THANK YOU.",

            "answer": "HiI hope someone can shed some light on a problem we're having. Out 11yo daughter (dx T1 17mth) has a Veo pump (Revel in US?) and Enlite CGMS for which we are very grateful. However, the CGM tells us that most nights she has very sudden, severe hypos followed by what we presume to be liver dumps resulting in his BGs come morning. Without the CGM we would most likely not be aware of these as she is hypo-unaware though the higher morning readings would suggest something is up at night.She could be on a glucose level of 10mmol/l (180mg/dl) and within 10-15 minutes her CGM shows <2.2 mmol/l (38mg/dl) followed by an equally quick rise to perhaps 11mmol/l (198mg/dl) or more. We've tried everything we can think of.We've given her a supper of full fat milk & occasionally some cheese, sometimes with very low bolus to cover. We've dropped her basal from 10pm until 3am by more than 60% of that leading up to 10pm. We've monitored exercise to see if it was being caused by PEL (post-exercise late onset hypo) but it happens even when she's had no exercise for days.Usually it happens between 12:30 and perhaps 2am but more recently it's happened at 11:30 or 4:30. We've on occasion by luck 'caught' it by BG but the number we get is likely later than the actual event given the CGM is 10-15 behind so the BG shows something like 7.0. However, this continues to rise (Symogyi effect) as we prove with later BG tests.From my reading I'm beginning to think it might be thyroid related though her last bloods were clear. She does have celiacs already. Any help much appreciated - perhaps it 'fits' with your own experience?Thanks,J",
