            "answer": "This is too funny because I was wondering the same thing. I had bloodwork and a urine test done in December when I used to smoke everyday, but they never said anything about finding THC in my urine or blood. They have to do a specific drug test for that and your not going to the endocronologist to get a drug test done, they are just checking if everything is good diabetes-wise, such as if you have sugar or blood in your urine. Don't worry, they wouldn't do anything anyways even if they did find something which they won't.",
