This is bloody, moderately inflamed and otherwise sparsely cellular. The inflammation is dominated by small round \u201cmature\u201d lymphocytes with occasional intermixed macrophage and polymorphic nucleated leukocyte. The remaining cellularity consists of anucleated cellular cytoplasmic remnant with only rare fragment of cytologically bland thyroid follicular epithelial cells; these are quantitavely limited and not further diagnostic.(B) Thyroid Nodule, Ultrasound Guided Biopsy:- Negative for malignant cells: inflamed otherwise sparse to acellular specimenPre-Op Diagnosis: Thyroid NodulePost-Op Diagnosis: Not specified",
