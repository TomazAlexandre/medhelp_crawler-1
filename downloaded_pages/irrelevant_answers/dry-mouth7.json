            "answer": "I suffer from a very dry mouth and throat and it's especially bad at night. I'm need to take a couple of glasses of water to bed with me at night because I'm waking up throughout the night so thirsty. Just wonder if you're on any medication that might be causing it? I take 25mg of Amitriptyline at night for anxiety & pain plus Pravastatin Sodium for high cholesterol. I know for definite a dry mouth can be symptom of Amitriptyline. Find that chewing gum during the day helps a lot. I've also been tested for diabetis and I'm not a diabetic. Check any medication you may be taking and see if that could be the cause.All the best.",
