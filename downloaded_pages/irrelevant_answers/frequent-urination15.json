    "question": "hi, the last day or two iv been going to the loo to pee a lot, last time i went about 5 or 6 times and alot each time. I know i dont have a uti or diabetes. Thing is this has kind of happened before (well not so much at night!) but I have IBD and when its bad I have in the past got bad pains in my sides at the back and going to the loo more in the day, I was tested several times for UTIs and they thought it was that and i was put on 4 different courses of antibitoics but they never bothered to check the lab results for the urine sample which always came back clear with nothing to culture. Iv just been put back on steroids for IBD, but i dont know why i have these urinary symptoms with it? and last night was just ridiculous because i couldnt get any sleep with it. dont know what i should do as i have to get some sleep tonight for work early on mon. any ideas?",
