            "answer": "I would be concerned as well. You desperately need to be seen. There's so many things that could be wrong that could easily be prevented with proper care. I understand money is an issue, but this is the health and care of you and your unborn child, and there should never be a dollar amount on something like that. I would say go to the hospital and get checked out.",

    "question": "Hi, I stumbled over this site while trying to figure out what my plan of action should be... maybe you could help.\u00a0\u00a0I am 38 weeks or so along, my last ob appt. was when I was 14 or 15 weeks, I have not been seen since. Our family makes $100 more than the limit for medicaid which is why we haven't been seen. Baby kicks well and I have slight BH contractions everyday now. All is well except one day I started to see what I'll describe as small silver \"lightning bugs\" shooting off in the right corner of my sight, it rarely happens but it does concern me, Do you believe that this is concern enough to go to the Hospital as I have no $ to see an OB (they all want cash upfront and a contract signed)any info you could provide would be so appreciated! Thanks",
