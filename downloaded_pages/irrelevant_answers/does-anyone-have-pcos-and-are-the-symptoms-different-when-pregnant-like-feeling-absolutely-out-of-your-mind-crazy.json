            "answer": "Well if you're taking Metformin and are pregnant, the Metformin drastically reduces your chance of miscarrying.Anyway, I have PCOS but I'm not pregnant. Part of PCOS is increased male androgens (or male hormones = testosterone). So because your hormones are off is why you feel out-of-control sometimes.Good luck and I hope you get your BFP!",
