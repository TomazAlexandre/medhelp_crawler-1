            "answer": "Something is not right here; Your 8-10 hour fasting levels indicate prediabetes yet your A1c averages 205 mg/dl daily - high diabetic glucose levels. Where were these test performed? Same blood draw?What does b/f mean? Please don't make up medical acronyms that only you understand.Testing directly after exercising provides a false positive. Brisk exercise perks your adrenaline which in turn tells your body to produce more glucose for energy. Exercise after eating, not before. Test before and 1 hour after exercising.\"What action is to be taken?\"You can start by educating yourself about diabetes prevention, control and management. Read other threads on this forum and use Google search. Maintain proper weight for your height, cut way back on consuming bad carbs, and exercise daily.
