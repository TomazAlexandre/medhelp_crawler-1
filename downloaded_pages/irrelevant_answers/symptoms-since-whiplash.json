            "answer": "I agree with the workup thus far, including the MRIs.Testing for peripheral neuropathy can be done with an EMG or nerve conduction study.If there are leg symptoms, a lumbar MRI can be pursued.Systemic causes of muscle weakness or pain can be done with blood tests looking for B12, thyroid dysfunction or diabetes.Systemic symptoms like these can be also cause be a variety of rheumatologic conditions.\u00a0\u00a0I would obtain an ANA level and ESR to exclude these possibilities.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patients education only.

    "question": "Hi - I had a cervical strain injury in June 2007.\u00a0\u00a0It was a very minor whiplash (braking - no crash).\u00a0\u00a0I felt a minor tear on left side of neck and tingling/burning which went away.\u00a0\u00a0Next day in the eve, I felt a sharp pain up the back of neck into head.\u00a0\u00a0I started trembling, sweating, diarrhea, left arm pain, dizziness and overall unwell. My pupils also looked different sizes at times. Lasted all week.\u00a0\u00a0First ER visit = anxiety dx.\u00a0\u00a0Second ER visit (when neck pain and stiffness started) =cervical strain. I have hypothryoidism and mild mitral valve prolapse.\u00a0\u00a0History of anxiety since going on synthroid in 2004, but never like this.\u00a0\u00a0After the whiplash - felt very uneasy, highly anxious, pacing around the house, felt insane, etc, body felt like it was burning, tingling, brain zaps, buzzing through body and head, shooting joint pains, headaches, very weak, lost weight.\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I've improved some with physical therapy and chiro but still having leg symptoms (tightness, heaviness when walking or standing).\u00a0\u00a0Pupils still different sizes (although not too noticeable unless I'm having a panic attack).\u00a0\u00a0Neurologist and other docs think it's anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0But, the leg symptoms are 24/7.\u00a0\u00a0Rarely do I have panic attack -- I feel pretty calm now but worry about physical symptoms all the time.\u00a0\u00a0The tingling and numbness is less and almost gone but when walking I feel like my gait is different and the back of my legs (muscles) hurt - even knees.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of cracking in knees/legs.\u00a0\u00a0More left leg.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes from knee down feels like legs are heavy.\u00a0\u00a0What could be causing all of these symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Brain MRI clear, x-rays ok, cervical MRI = mild bulging C5,6,7.\u00a0\u00a0Also feel like I'm being \"pushed down\" at times -- like there's a weight on head although headaches are very infrequent and dull.\u00a0\u00a0Dizziness (swaying) better.\u00a0\u00a0Seeing an osteopath soon who will be treating neck issues - slight pain, mostly stiffness.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
