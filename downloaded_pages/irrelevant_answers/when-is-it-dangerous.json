    "question": "I am trying to find out if the situation we are in is as bad as I am thinking..My nephew was just recently hospitalized and then diagnosed with diabetes. He is five and his parents are divorced. When he is with his mother, his blood sugar levels range from 300 to 500 which from what all I have read is DANGEROUSLY high. His insulin is adjusted to those high sugars. When he gets to his dad's home where the diet and activity is much more controlled, he goes really low and the dad is constantly feeding him to keep the levels up. The mother refuses to adhere to the diet- for instance, feeding the child 2 bowls of Reese's Puffs cereal at his afternoon snack!- Or, pop tarts, big league chewing gum, cake. etc. The father has begged her to go more by the diet and even tried to explain how important it is. She just denies that she is doing wrong and says he won't be an outcast at her home.My question is --Is this really dangerous? Today his sugar was at 551 when his dad picked him up. The doctor seems like this is all normal or at the most will tell us that WE need to talk to her. I read about diabetes and it seems to me that she is putting him at risk for major complications now and in the future..Which is it??",
