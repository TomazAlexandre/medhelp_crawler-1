            "answer": "Hey Vanniee!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possible causes that may need to be considered include GI infections, inflammations, malsorption syndromes, medication side effect, IBS etc. Without a definite diagnosis at hand it is difficult to suggest a management plan. I would suggest getting this evaluated in detail by a gastroenterologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
