I felt dizzy for a good 15min afterwards.Is it common for everyone to have these tests regulary?My impression was they were going to check blood group and if I have any diseases and then just leave my blood intact inside me..?I guess if I have to.. but I am a bit freaked out now.",

My situation is not like any most... so dont think they will take your blood as many as mine... the first blood test was a pregnancy test because the urine test was negative and I knew it was wrong so they ordered a blood test.. 2nd was prenatal blood work.. 3rd was because im being monitored for preeclampsia since I had chronic hypertension prior to pregnancy (high blood pressure),\u00a0\u00a04th I was sick, 5th was the a repeat of the preeclampsia test (its a 24 hour urine test followed by a blood test the next morning to compare protein levels), 6th was the gestational diabetes test, 7th-10th was a repeat of the gestational diabetes test that I failed the first time (if you fail the 1st one they send you for a 3hr test and take your blood 4 times)...It is common for women to feel nausea and faint after a blood draw but I used to donate blood when I was 17 and I never felt that way-- the bad part about donating blood as much as I did-- I have soo much scar tissue that it hurts",

They will likely take urine test too, so drink a bit.3. Bring a soda or candy for your dizziness afterwards.4. Dont be surpriced if you get very nausiated and sick. Bring someone to support you.I was surpriced to find myself nausiated and sick.. I even started crying because I thought I was going to throw up (I didnt). It was horrible and I have no idea where all those emotions came from.I am very greatful I had my husband with me, because even if you didnt know how much blood they will take, and forgot to bring candy or a soda.. I think it would have been much worse without him. He is my hero.",
