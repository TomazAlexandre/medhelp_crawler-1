    "question": "Hi; I am a 47 year old female with type 2 diabetes that I control with diet. I have entered menopause and am taking hormone replacement. I have noticed that the heart palpitations that I have had most of my adult life have increased and I have noticed that they start after I eat something or even if I change position...such as turning on my side of leaning over. I also notice that if I can \"burp\" this helps. Does this possibly indicate heaart trouble?",
