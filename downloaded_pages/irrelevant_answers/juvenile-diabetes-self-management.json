            "answer": "I am not a physician, but the mom of a type one diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I understand where you are coming from with this question, when my daughter was diagnosed she was in a private school that did not always do the proper things when it cam e to her diabetes, No matter how much I tried to educate the nurses.\u00a0\u00a0 We were able to move so that we were in a better school system with nurses that were more knowledge able in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes I actually interviewed the nurses in the schools, before I went out with the realtor.\u00a0\u00a0If the nurse was not willing to do the correct things I was not moving to that area.\u00a0\u00a0We were lucky to move to a system where all the nurses are very knowledgeable in diabetes and are proactive in the care of the kids.Another thing that has helped is to have a 504 plan in place and to make sure that the school is following the plan and if they are not them to take it to a higher level.\u00a0\u00a0 Remember we need to be advocates for our kids.The other thing that I would recommend is that if there are a lot of fluctuations see if it is related to school activity and contact your endocrinologist or diabetic team to adjust you daughter insulin dosages or rates.\u00a0\u00a0If it is not related to school I would still fax the doctor her numbers and see if she needs to be adjusted in rates, or ratios.\u00a0\u00a0We do this when we see that there are a lot of fluctuations for our daughter.For help with the 504 plan there are several web sites:www.childrenwithdiabetes.comwww.jdrf.orgI hope this helps.

            "answer": "Hi there, as to how much management an 8 yr old should do is up to the child and the parent.\u00a0\u00a0Our doctor believes that the parent should know how to do everything, but to let the child lead the way as to how much responsibility they want.I am very lucky that at the age of eight my daughter wanted the responsibly to do as much herself as possible. (Even now at the age of 10 I get asked to do it).\u00a0\u00a0At eight Jess was doing her own reservoir, site changes, basically everything herself.\u00a0\u00a0She always verifies what the bolus wizard or her dosages with an adult, but she does every thing for the most part herself. She feels it is her disease and that she needs to take care of it.\u00a0\u00a0There are plenty of times though that she will say, I am not in the mood to do it can you or dad do it. That is ok with us.One thing that I feel has helped Jess be more self sufficient in her diabetes is diabetes camp. She has gone for years now and each time she comes home she takes on more responsibly at her own pace.",
