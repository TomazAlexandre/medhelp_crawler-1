            "answer": "First, a gallblader that doesn't visualize util 60 miutes on HIDA is consistent with chronic cholecystitis. Second, I can't believe all he gussing and random diagnoses without any testing over a full year. You didn't mention CCK with the HIDA scan. You also didn't mention having an ultrasound. This is generally required before having a HIDA wth CCK to measure gallblader function. Th CT scan is not sufficient to rule out gallstones as you could stop the evaluation is there were some found. GERD is alsoa possbility but is not diagnosed by some medication trial, a pH study is required.",

    "question": "I have been having symptoms for about a year now.\u00a0\u00a0It all started with this pain in my upper middle chest, under breastbone that just wouldnt go away. It was a dull type of pain. I also developed severe bloating where I would look pregnant at times. Initially I was dx'ed with gastritits based on symptoms alone, and my family dr. put me on generic of Prilosec once daily.\u00a0\u00a0After over a month, nothing changed, symptoms were still the same so he bumped me up to two a day. After about a week of taking it twice daily, my symptoms appeared to go away, but not for long.\u00a0\u00a0After maybe a couple months they reappeared and worse than ever.\u00a0\u00a0I have bloating now EVERYDAY and constantly.\u00a0\u00a0The pain comes and goes depending on the day. Sometimes i get pain on my left side as well. Maybe due to the bloating?? No pain on the right side tho, just upper central and sometimes left side.\u00a0\u00a0My dr. referred me on to a gastroenterologist.\u00a0\u00a0I had an upper gi, ultrasound, and blood tests done, all were normal.\u00a0\u00a0My gastro thought i had a slow emptying stomach so he dx'ed me with gastroparesis without any testing just based on my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I am a type 1 diabetic and I think that made him believe thats what it was.\u00a0\u00a0Well i was not convinced since I take care of my diabetes so i requested a gastric emptying study and it came back normal so he removed the diagnosis of gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0I had also had a endoscope done as well with nothing showing up.\u00a0\u00a0He next ordered me a CT scan and HIDA Scan, and blood test for gluten.\u00a0\u00a0The gluten test came back negative and the CT scan came back clear.\u00a0\u00a0The HIDA scan I had done took a while for my gallbladder to show up, about 60 minutes when I was told by the tech it should take anywhere between 20-45 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Is 60 minutes indication of something wrong?? I was later told by my gastro at my follow up that the radiologist who read the report said he couldnt read it???? Um, okay?? So my gastro was mad of course b/c we were left in the dark about the reports.\u00a0\u00a0My gastro went ahead and gave me the antibiotic of Xifaxan (sp) to see if maybe it was a bacteria issue. I took it for 10 days with no help.\u00a0\u00a0He now wants my HIDA scan redone (should be free of charge) since they screwed up my first one.\u00a0\u00a0I have to wait though until after the holidays but am getting really frustrated with my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It is interferring with my life and leaving me depressed! Do my symptoms sound like gallbladder or something else??? Again its just CONSTANT bloating, even when i wake up i am bloated.\u00a0\u00a0It isnt as bad in morning since i havent eaten all night but i can still feel it and then throughout the day it gets progressively worse.\u00a0\u00a0There isnt a day that goes by that I do not have this bloating. The pain seems to be around for days in a row then disappears for a few then comes back.\u00a0\u00a0Mostly in the center.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried to pinpoint certain foods but it doesnt seem to make a difference foodwise.\u00a0\u00a0I also will note that I am still taking the prilosec b/c when I try to wean myself off of it, i get indigesion so that is also a symptom I have if not for the prilosec. Sorry this is so long just really wanting some hope.\u00a0\u00a0At this point I am hoping it is my gallbladder. I am scared to have surgery but I want my life back and I want an answer.\u00a0\u00a0life is hard enough with type 1 diabetes, but this makes it miserable! Anyone shed some light on this or have similar situation?? Thanks",
