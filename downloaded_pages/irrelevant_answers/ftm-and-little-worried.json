    "question": "I'm 32 weeks today with my first child and I have these unbearable pains in my lower right side . I constantly have this downward pressure in my uterus but I don't think I've lost my plug yet. I go to the Dr. on Tuesday. Should I wait until then or go to the ER.? No preeclampsia, no diabetes, labs have been normal. I just get worried bc it seems hard to differentiate between braxton-hicks and something else.",
