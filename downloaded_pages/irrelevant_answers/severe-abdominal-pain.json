            "answer": "Appendicitis needs a CT scan to evaluate.\u00a0\u00a0Kidney disease would also be seen during the CT scan, and can be evaluated with a blood creatinine level.\u00a0\u00a0Gallbladder disease is first evaluated with an ultrasound, and if normal, then a HIDA scan.\u00a0\u00a0The biliary tree of the gallbladder is evaluated with an MRCP or ERCP.If the endoscopies are negative, the next test to consider would be an abdominal CT scan.If all the tests are negative, irritable bowel syndrome can then be considered and treated (i.e. increasing fiber in the diet as well as antispasmodic agents).These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.Medical Weblog:kevinmd_b",

            "answer": "I had your same symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It was discovered through an upper GI that I had a hiatel hernia and an ulcer.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently the ulcer caused scaring which closed my pylorus, thus causing the vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0I was having severe abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0It went on for almost five months while the doctor was conducting tests.\u00a0\u00a0Once he found the problem, he opened my pylorus and I have not vomited since.\u00a0\u00a0I am still taking the Protonix.\u00a0\u00a0It is the same type of medicine that you are taking. I thought for sure that my hiatel hernia was causing all of the problems.\u00a0\u00a0However, I was wrong.\u00a0\u00a0It's kind of strange.\u00a0\u00a0I was constipated severely the entire time that this was going on.\u00a0\u00a0Your should see a gastrologist and ask for an upper GI.\u00a0\u00a0Anytime you have vomiting, they always say that it is associated with the digestive tract, which is the upper portion. (Even when it feels like your entire stomach is killing you.)\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I'm 37 yrs. old and for the past month I have been having sporadic abdominal pain that is almost unbearable at times. It started one evening with severe bloating, nausea, and vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0After the first emergency room visit, the doctor prescribed Prevacid.\u00a0\u00a0It got worse a few days later and I was prescribed Reglan, Levsin, and Nexium.\u00a0\u00a0I have now had an Ultra-sound, Endoscopy, and Colonoscopy and other than a hiatal hernia that was discovered, everything else looked normal.\u00a0\u00a0However, my white blood cell count was a bit elevated.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still taking the Nexium and the acid reflux is better; however, the severe abdominal cramps are still there; I also feel pain in the middle of my back and my right shoulder.\u00a0\u00a0I'm always fatigued and I have no appetite.\u00a0\u00a0I've been constipated for the entire period. I belch constantly and it hurts right below my breast plate.\u00a0\u00a0Can I rule out things like appendicitis, kidney desease, or gallbladder desease?\u00a0\u00a0Can all of this be caused by the hiatal hernia? Could it be a bad viral infection?\u00a0\u00a0I have not been prescribed any antibiotics.",
