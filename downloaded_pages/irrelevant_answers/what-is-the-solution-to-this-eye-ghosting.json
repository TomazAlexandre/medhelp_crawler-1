            "answer": "First of all I want to be sure you are under the care of Eye MDs and not optometrists. Your eye condition and diabetes needs a MD physician. If that is the case its not clear how many physicians you've seen. The Pentacam tests the central cornea. I would suggest you get a second opinion from a cornea/refractive surgeon. Ask about a corneal topography which would give a better look at the peripheral cornea.\u00a0\u00a0Yes an early cataract could cause these symptoms. If you have have type 1 diabetes and have had for more than 10-15 years cataracts are not unusual especially if your diabetes is not well controlled (A1c >7.0)The other thing I would suggest is a macular OCT as you could also have diabetic macular swelling (edema)",

            "answer": "An update: Visited the famous All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS) in New Delhi, India. They said that i have some form of astigmatism and eye convergence issue. They have prescribed new glasses and eye workouts (orthoptic workup). Have been doing those eye exercises for the past one week - it is better now, the light beams that i used to see from the light source has become slightly better. Waiting for the new glasses.",

    "question": "I have the same issue. I see two images on bright lights one on top of the other and sometimes below for the past one year. Initially my doctors said it was dry eyes but has not gone away despite using systane ultra and genteal gel. I visited another doctor, he conducted a PENTACAM test but it was all normal. He suggested that I wear contact lens to see if it goes away, but NO it still remains. Meanwhile, now I am also noticing light glares coming out of bright light sources like car headlights, white background in television etc. Also shining star like object in lights (but not much in number). Sometimes it is also difficult for me to get a sharp image in low light conditions. Is this a case of early cataract? Or some other disease? I am 35 years old and diabetic.",
