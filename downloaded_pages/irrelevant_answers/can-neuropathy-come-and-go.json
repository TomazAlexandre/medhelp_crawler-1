            "answer": "Actually it can come and go, but generally becomes permanent after enough damage has been done to the nerves. Diabetic neuropathy for example. A person can lose complete sensation in the feet, get their diabetes under control, and the neuropathy may disappear. Let's say the numbness and lack of sensation can disappear. The word neuropathy becomes meaningless.\u00a0\u00a0You don't provide enough of a history to make any sort of constructive comment.",

            "answer": "Hi,Sharp, stabbing intermittent pains are not related to neuropathy. Neuropathy is mostly characterized by numbness and tingling episodes with pain. Sharp\u00a0\u00a0stabbing pains may be due to other disorders like Fibromyalgia. Other causes are Chronic fatigue syndrome, Dermatomyositis, Diabetic ketoacidosis, African sickness, Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Eclampsia, Hypopituitarism , Hypothyroidism and many others. Please consult another physician for examination , investigations and diagnosis. A detailed history is required to understand the nature, frequency, location, intensity and severity of pain which is a must for diagnosis. Please go for a full body scan and consult a pain specialist or neurologist.Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",
