            "answer": "I tested positive with my last pregnancy and woth this one. You can have them retest you if you'd like. Like she says ^ you could have it one week and not the next... I did all my research on it. I didn't get the antibiotics with my last child. He didn't sick. My water literally broke and he was born within minutes. He had barely if any contact. I'm hoping this birth goes about the same. :) Either way good luck mama!!",

            "answer": "I would argue with them if I were you!!! They can not base it off an old test that's like women that take the 1 hour glucose test and it coming back positive and then you retaking it doing the 3 hour one and it comes back negative and they say \"well the first one came back positive so you have gestational diabetes\" they are trying to make money off of you but diagnosing you with something you don't have!!",
