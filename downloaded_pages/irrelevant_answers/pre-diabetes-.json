            "answer": "He should be staying away from all carbohydrates including whole wheat bread and his diet should be fat and protein. You're hypoglycemic because of the drugs. If he's not yet on any drugs, and completely cuts out carbs, his glucose level would stabilize back to normal.It's a tough diet tho. I managed for 2 days only. Couldn't stand the constant hunger. But for him, unfortunately, it's either that or drugs/insulin for the rest of his life. There a good side to this diet: he would lose weight without even trying - that's certain.",
