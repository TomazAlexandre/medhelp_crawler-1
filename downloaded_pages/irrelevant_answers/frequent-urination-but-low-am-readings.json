            "answer": "You might try testing your glucose after meals as well and/or getting an A1C which will show you an average of all your glucose readings. I'm not sure what a commercial device to help with deep breathing would be, but off the top of my head this might influence blood pressure but not glucose. Have you spoken with your doctor about your symptoms? You don't say how long you have been Type II diabetic but after awhile diet and exercise need to be aided by meds.",

            "answer": "Are you doing deep breathing exercises as a way to de-stress and stay calm??\u00a0\u00a0If so, it may have an effect on both your BP and BS numbers, due to the fact that stress brings both BP and BS levels up...less stress, better numbers...but, as Zoelula says, check with your doctor...Diabetes is a progressive disease and it may be time to add oral meds!",

    "question": "Hi, I am not on meds, using diet and exercise to control but in the last 2 months have experienced frequent urination, mostly at night, some tingling/burning in feet and hands, again at night. My AM\u00a0\u00a0test readings ( bf eating ) recently have been in the range of 70-80 which if correct would lead me to think this is an improvement. IF that is so, why would the burning start --- something I have had vy little of until now.\u00a0\u00a0I do have Osteoporosis and High Bl Pressure butI have also seen an improvement in the latter. .\u00a0\u00a0Now running abt 120/65, again without my meds.I have been doing deep breathing exercises with the help of a commercial device and am wondering if it could be having an effect on both the Diabetes and HBP ?Junie",
