            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I know it sounds unrelated but you need to test for diabetes and hypothyroidism. Another possibility is nerve compression at upper cervical level. Compression of the brachial plexus by a cervical rib is another reason.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "have had these symptoms for about 4 years now, had many different kinds of doctors look at it, none with any answers. as long as I am moving, none of the symptoms occur. As soon as I stop moving weather standing or sitting, the symptoms start. they are as follows. the neck muscle tightens up, get dull pain behind the right shoulder blade, the terres minor muscle starts to get erratated, feels like my forearm is in a vise and is beeing crushed, the thumb and first two fingers start to go numb, and then start to tingle on top of the fingers. I can stop all this by lifting my right arm and bending the elbow back and pushing at the elbow forcing my arm backwords and it cracks in front of the chest by the pec muscle.",
