            "answer": "It could possibly be a gallbladder attack. With my first pregnancy I ended up with gallstones right at the very end and it's really common for pregnant women.\u00a0\u00a0The pain would be at the very top of my belly. It would hurt so bad I would get nauseous and it felt like it burned too. I ended up having mine removed 2 months after having my daughter. Talk to your Dr and see if this could be the cause. If it is I would have it removed very soon after baby arrives cause the attacks come and go. Hope this helps. Let me know if you find out the source of your problem. Good luck to you.",
