            "answer": "I have had personal experiences with God also, but God works when God is ready.\u00a0\u00a0I do not believe in telling people not to seek out medical intervention because it states right in the bible that if you are sick, seek a physician.\u00a0\u00a0God gave us the knowledge to do the things that we do and what we need to pray for here is that God gives the doctors she is seeing Wisdom.\u00a0\u00a0If he decided to heal her, then GREAT!\u00a0\u00a0I am a Christian also.Now, as your your problems, did you know that oxygen can cause headaches to be worse?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you need to turn your oxygen down a little bit.CBT is cognitive behavior therapy, something that would probably help your sleep problems, I am about to go through it myself.\u00a0\u00a0As far as the other things go, I would say to just keep doing what your doctors say, but keep in mind that sleep medications lose their effect after awhile and that is probably why the Rozeram isn't working very well anymore.\u00a0\u00a0You have to change sleep meds often.\u00a0\u00a0But, the absolute best thing to do is to get the CBT and learn how to deal with the insomnia without drugs.Good luck to you and God Bless.",
