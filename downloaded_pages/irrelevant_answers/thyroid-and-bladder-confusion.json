            "answer": "Ok - lots of issues here......Parlodel is for high prolactin NOT high thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0You need to see an endocrinologist if you have high prolactin levels.\u00a0\u00a0You also need to be rechecked for a urinary tract infection.\u00a0\u00a0The parlodel may have helped the periods (which are lighter/absent in the case of elevated prolactin).\u00a0\u00a0Prolactin comes from the pituitary in the brain -- need MRI of brain to look at this area if indeed the prolactin is high.\u00a0\u00a0The gluten intolerance sounds like celiac sprue.\u00a0\u00a0The bladder may not be related to the hormone issue -- unless you have extreme thirst and frequent urination which brings up the possibility of diabetes insipidus\u00a0\u00a0--\u00a0\u00a0this is very complicated and I recommend seeing an endocrinologist to sort it out -- at least make sure that if you have a high prolactin level that an MRI of the brain/pituitary is done....good luck.",
