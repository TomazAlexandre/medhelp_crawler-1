            "answer": "The test-tube effects of these various supplement products are touted in marketing but have not been shown to have a clinically significant effect when taken by humans.\u00a0\u00a0I have looked into this for mangosteen in the past and saw no human trials proving a benefit.There is no data regarding the effect on T4 treatment - so if you use these products would retest thyroid levels after about 6 weeks to see if there was an effect that would result in synthroid dose adjustment.Mangosteen, like nano juice, seems like it would have a great benefit on metabolic syndrome -- but we thought that when looking at test-tube data for Avandia (a major diabetes drug) but now there have been reports of increased cardiovascular death with Avandia.....so, while supplements are generally not likely to do significant harm, there is little proof a benefit -- so the biggest risk is to your wallet.",

    "question": "Had thyroidectomy for cancer 4 years ago at age 50.\u00a0\u00a0Am looking at metabolic syndrome in me now.\u00a0\u00a0Mangosteen fruit juice has xanthones.\u00a0\u00a0The research on this fruit shows some actual effectiveness in decreasing LDL, being cytotoxic to MRSA, is a histamine H1 receptor agonist and a serotenergic receptor blocking substance as well as a 5HAA receptor agonist.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that Transthyretin transports T4.\u00a0\u00a0It looks like one of the many xanthones binds Transthyretin.\u00a0\u00a0Can I take Mangosteen?\u00a0\u00a0Would synthroid need adjusted? more or less? Thx.",
