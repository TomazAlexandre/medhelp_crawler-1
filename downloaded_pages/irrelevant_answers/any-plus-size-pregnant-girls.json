            "answer": "I had lost a lot of weight for my wedding last Aug but wasn't to my goal weight yet. So, I'm still a bigger girl (size 16 usually). Keep focusing on eating right. Your big test will be when it's time to check for gestational diabetes. If you can, make sure to take walks daily. If you get gestational diabetes, it's a really strict diet. I think I have heard of some women also having to take insulin. Also watch your blood pressure. The blood pressure could be a sign of preclampsia.\u00a0\u00a0Larger women have healthy babies all the time. These diagnosis aren't just for the big girls, but skinny ones too. The main focus for a pregnancy from what I can figure out (I'm 39 weeks tomorrow) is healthy mom and healthy baby. Keeping those as the focus helps. Keep your lines of communication open with your doc. I was so sick for the beginning of my pregnancy I actually lost about 37 lbs. I am a couple pounds now under my prepregnancy weight. Doc wasn't worried because I kept those communication lines open and we talked about everything. Good luck!!! and Congrats! :)",
