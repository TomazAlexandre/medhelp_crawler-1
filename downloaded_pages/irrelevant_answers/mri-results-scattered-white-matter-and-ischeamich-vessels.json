            "answer": "Hi!Scattered foci of increased T2 signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines. Please discuss with your treating doctors. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

            "answer": "Thank you indeed for your reply. I would like to know if it is possible that I suffered a stroke or seizures because I have had short episodes of illness where I loose my ability to speak, to swallow, to masticate and to move. When I become ill I also have urine retention for three days and constipation for more than a week. Prior to all these events I suffer pins and needles in my extremities followed by severe electric shock sensations in my spine and in my head. Could you let me know if I could be suffering from strokes and/or seizures?Thank you once again for your know-how",
