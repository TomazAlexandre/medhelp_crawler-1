You need some basic urine testing done and also have to have kidney stones ruled out too.grace",

    "question": "usually this pain happens at least once a day, i dont have burning urination, sometimes the urine is especially smelly.recently i've developed really bad low back pain, as well as random stabbing pains in my feet, hands, etc.my bladder has also started to feel tight. its hard to explain this feeling. its not like i need to go pee or anything it just feels.. tight/ or sore?i have an appointment at my local planned parenthood for std testing, but i dont think they do blood cultures and HSV or HPV would have to be tested with blood cultures correct?",
