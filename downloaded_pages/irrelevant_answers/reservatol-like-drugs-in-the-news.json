    "question": "\"A drug that exploits the benefits of a component in wine proved safe and showed signs that it might improve blood sugar control in people with the most common form of diabetes, Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc said on Monday. The results come from the first human study of a drug that targets a family of genes called sirtuins that control the aging process in humans. The drug mimics the effects of resveratrol, a chemical in red wine that has been shown in several studies to prolong the life of mice and reduce the advance of age-related diseases, such as diabetes.\"http://tinyurl.com/2trvhp\"Their latest research shows these experimental drug compounds -- which are 1,000 times more potent than resveratrol -- helped reverse diabetes symptoms and reduce insulin sensitivity in two different studies in diabetic mice and one in rats.http://www.reuters.com/article/healthNews/idUSN2861871620071128",
