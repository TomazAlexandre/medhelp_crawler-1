            "answer": "Hi,The causes of polyneuropathy other than Diabetes are- old age, some medications and\u00a0\u00a0drugs, such as some chemotherapy drugs, alcohol abuse, AIDS, environmental toxins, and inherited neurological neuropathies.

It may be the use of anticancer drugs for thyroid cancer that may have lead to the development of Polyneuropathy for you.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult a neurologist for evaluation, diagnosis and treatment. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",
