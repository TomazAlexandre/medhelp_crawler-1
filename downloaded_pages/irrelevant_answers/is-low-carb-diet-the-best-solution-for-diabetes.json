            "answer": "I have had good results by tight carb control. Experts recommend 45-65 grams of carb per meal. My doctor insists her patients eat only 30-45 gms. per meal. I tightened that down even more and try for less than 30 per meal and only eat breakfast and dinner. No snacks; although you can have them if they are 10 or less grams. I have lost 30 pounds since starting in June and my fasting blood sugars went from over 190 to being 129 or less. Most mornings, I get a reading of 115-118.\u00a0\u00a0I exercise every day on a treadmill (usually after dinner) and try to walk at least 4-5 miles at a brisk pace of 3.5 mph. It's not easy but you can do it! I am on no meds and my doctor says if I keep this up, I probably will not need them. Good luck!",

            "answer": "That's fantastic result, Osakarose! AHA recommended 20g of daily sugar intake for women and 40g for men. I also have a friend who has halved her triglyceride level and LDL since she started paleo/low-sugar diet. I think the trick is to increase one's fat intake to take the place of carbohydrates and limit protein to 20-25% of the daily calorie intake. Don't starve, OK???",
