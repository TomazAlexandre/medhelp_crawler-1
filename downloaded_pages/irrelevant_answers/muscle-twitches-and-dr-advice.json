            "answer": "Your friend is correct High BG numbers are doing damage to your body.The MD is not worried about your BG, when complications from high BG set in,\u00a0\u00a0ITs you that gets them NOT the MDNever herd of twitching as a complication from D (but I dont know everything).\u00a0\u00a0High BG numbers dont help ANY condition.Drugs lower BG,\u00a0\u00a0carbohydrates raise BG,\u00a0\u00a0eat less carbs, have less BG rise, need less drugs.If you could tolerate 1g of met go back on that and add janumet .\u00a0\u00a0Met is a good drug, safe, makes your insulin work better, reduces liver dumping sugar.\u00a0\u00a0janumet not so much, janumet\u00a0\u00a0FOCES the pancreas to put out more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0If your pancreas is shot (BG of 20 would indicate that) then your pancreas probably cant put out more insulin.I am not an MDJust diabetic for 28 years\u00a0\u00a0well controlled for now again",

            "answer": "Your numbers are dangerously high.Did you see a dr already?\u00a0\u00a0What was the treatment?If your blood sugar is that high and is not helped by oral medications, you likely need to be on insulin instead.High blood sugars are nothing to play around with, and need to be treated.I get muscle issues when my blood sugars are too high.\u00a0\u00a0This can be because when your sugars are high in your blood it pulls all the water out of your cells causing them to be dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0The treatment is to noramlise blood sugars.I can't believe your dr is content to only see you every three months with blood sugars this high without doing anything to address them properly and quickly.\u00a0\u00a0It may be time for a new Dr.",

    "question": "I've had diabetes for since I was 24, and have had it quite controlled for about 12 years, until the beginning of this year. I noticed twitching in my hand, like the twitch your eye gets sometimes when you're tired. Irritating, but it goes away. After two solid weeks of it twitching non stop I went to the drs. He tested my HBA1c and it had jumped from around 6 to 9.8. I hadn't been doing my sugars (because they had been good for so long and I hadn't changed my lifestyle in any way) and when I started testing again, they were 15-20 when they had always been 4-8. I went on metformin 1g, no change after three months. went up to two grams and was so nauseus for weeks, changed to janumet 1g. My sugars are still up around 15 every day, and my hand still hasnt stopped twitching. I get it all over my body randomly, but always in my hand. It doesn't hurt but is irritating and my hand is sore from overworking.My dr said this was a diabetes issue but I have never heard of it before among other sufferers, and he just brushes it away when I mention it. Should I just get used to itHe also is quite content to leave my appointments for three months when I am having high sugars every day. how long should I expect it to take before my sugars level out? A friend said that numbers so high can start doing serious damage, but she is a worrywart so it is hard so know if I should just wait or if I should ask to see a specialist. Any help please?",
