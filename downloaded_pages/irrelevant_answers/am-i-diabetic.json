            "answer": "From your post, hard to say what's going on, especially as you don't mention what your illness was/is.\u00a0\u00a0BUT... I'll just say this... I have yet to find any study that says a \"diabetic diet\" is NOT beneficial to anyone regardless of health status; meaning that if you increase your low-starch veggies, avoid excess sugar, increase fiber, increase green leafy veggies, decrease animal products, and maintain an active lifestyle, your blood sugars and your general health and energy levels should benefit.Keep seeing your doc, stay on top of how you're feeling and pay attention to that, and watch your diet, and hopefully you'll be well... just stay attentive and continue seeking professional advice.Best to you...",

            "answer": "I agree with Pete but here are some things to consider as well.\u00a0\u00a0First all of the sugar numbers that you mention are in fact normal levels for those of us that are diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0However I am not sure if they are normal for those without diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0128 is not high.\u00a0\u00a06.1 A1c is not high and 99 after a big meal is DEFINATELY not high.\u00a0\u00a0Two hours after a meal is when your levels will be the highest!!!\u00a0\u00a0Stress and illness can cause elevated levels as can all the vitmins and if you were drinking orange juice instead of taking vitamin C pills that can also cause an increase.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if the pills cause an increase or not.All that being said I am not a Dr. and I can not tell you the diagnosis is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0One would think that a Dr. would not make that diagnosis without just cause.\u00a0\u00a0And I am sure that I do not have all of the facts that they had.\u00a0\u00a0So I guess a second opinion is a good idea or going back for a second set of tests might be good too.",

For every bottle you drank you consumed almost 2 heaping tablespoons of SUGAR. Stop drinking this KoolAid and get retested in 3 months.",

    "question": "I had some \"high\" glucose levels (highest 128) when I was ill. I had severe muscle aches, sore throat for at least 6 weeks. I was highly stressed by it all. I also drank lots of Vitamin Waters and take lots of vitamin C. At the end of the illness, my doctor sent me for that diabetes test that looks at the past 2 months or so. The result was 6.1. He said I was diabetic. My question: Is this diagnosis for certain? Could the result be an error because of the illness and stress. I feel fine now. I've been tested on a home monitor daily for weeks and the results - even a couple of hours after Thanksgiving dinner were never higher than 99. Friends and family at dinner that night all test higher on the same monitor. What do you think?",
