            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling?Yes it is likely that you have pinched nerve. What MRI you have got it done? Is it Brain or Spine?If it is only brain then I think you should be doing at least MRI of cervical region to rule out pathology of cervical spine including any spinal disc pathology.If you have done spine MRI then what is the report?I think you should be continuing treatment for stroke and get a review opinion from a neurologist regarding your numbness till your pinky finger.I feel it might be due to your nerve compression and nerve in question here is Ulnar nerve.Keep me informed.Bye.",

Almost back to full mobility now.\u00a0\u00a0I had a brain and neck MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I think they diagnosed a stroke because I reported weakness and tingling on the right side of my body, in addition to the more severe immobility in my hand.\u00a0\u00a0I see my primary physician today because the neurologist said (in his report) that no followup with him was necessary.\u00a0\u00a0This is after he was a no-show at the hostpital the day after, and had his associate talk to me by phone (while I was in the hospital) instead.\u00a0\u00a0His associate said I would have a follow-up neurology appointment but I guess they changed their mind.\u00a0\u00a0Now I need a referral to get back to see him.\u00a0\u00a0Guess they figure a healthy middle age man having a stroke is just another routine matter.",

            "answer": "I had a very jolting pain yesterday, like 20 knives sticking me in my middle left back. I got up and walked it off in one minute. The left side of my body felt a little numb but went away in 2 hours, I still have a slight headache this morning.Reading many posts, 9 out of 10 strokes have no pain? I thinking this was a pinched nerve? I can't stand to go to the hospital/emergency it would have made me more jittery and maybe another pinched nerve?I have Diabetes, high blood pressure, but this is in very good control.Any thoughts? please? thanks.Al",
