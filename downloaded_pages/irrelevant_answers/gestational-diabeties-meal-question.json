            "answer": "I'm in the same situation, I found out last week and don't meet the diabetes educator until Wednesday. Its all about the sugar and carbs and counting them. Carbs turn into sugar so you have to make sure your not eating too many. I've found some great recipes on the diabetes association website. The internet can be scary to read but also you can find some very helpful information, there are so many recipes to choose from. Hope that helps and good luck! I'm 29 weeks with my baby girl and trying really hard to watch what I eat.",

No milk or juices, just water. 3 meals a day and 2-3 snack. I eat a lot of cheeses and hard boiled eggs for snacks. Once you meet with your nutritionist you will get a glucometer and be checking your levels a lot and that will tell you if you need to cut carbs back even more. It took forever for them to get me into a nutritionist so I hope this helps you! I hated waiting. My glucose levels went right back to normal with this diet and I stay active, if I cheat a little which is easy with your cravings I go for a walk or exercise to make up for it. But I rarely cheat just because I did in the beginning and my amniotic fluid levels went too high and it scared me. So now I'm really strict.",
