            "answer": "If it's the 1 hour test, I've heard different numbers, depending on the doctor. I think my doctor said 140 is the cutoff. Higher than that also doesn't mean diabetes for sure, just that they need to test again, usually every hour for 3 hours. They do that so they have a baseline for you (what your sugar is before the drink) and then can compare to see how quickly your body processes it. How quickly it goes down is more important than the number itself.",

            "answer": "I failed my 1 hour and 3 hour test. Went on the diabetic diet and checked my sugar for a month. Went back to the diabetic clinic and doctor looked at my sugar levels for the last month and said I was fine. Not sure if I was actually diabetic or if my doctor thought the sugars were close to the cutoff.",

            "answer": "Sugars need to be lower than 140 fasting to even do the test...they will not give you the glucose drink if your sugars are already high! Then it's something like below 140 after 1 hr, 120 after 2 hrs, and then back below 100/90 after 3 hrs...if you do the 3 hr test.My suggestion is don't try to change your habits to pass it, because some ppl will say to you to eat high protein meal night before and drink a ton of cold water and to walk around during test. All of those things will bring your sugars down however if you don't do those things all the time your results will come bk negative for GD but if you don't continue to to do them the GD goes un-diagnosed and you will have health issues...Just do your normal routine and stuff and I am sure you will either get through with flying colors or you will get the help to manage GD! I have it, it stinks, but I am healthy and my baby is too!",
