            "answer": "Dear Tracey, if you feel that the g.p was jumping the gun you can always seek a 2nd opinion, were any blood /urine tests done? a colonoscopy involves a flexi tube with a camera being passed through the rectum, it can pick up any polyps or lumps that should not be there, if the g.ps think bladder/kidney cancer then an ultra sound scan should be performed ,this may be a process of illimination at first and as your dad is seen by one specialist he may be feferred to an other, the important thing is to ask questions if you do not understand anything that is going on have them prepared for your dads next visit, i wish you and dad all the best, love merge61 u.k",

            "answer": "The colonoscopy is not going to tell you why he has blood in his urine.He definitely should be getting some blood and urine tests ordered by his GP/Family Physician for starts.If the GP is suspicious of bladder or kidney cancer, then your father should be sent to a specialist to follow up and sort all of this out.\u00a0\u00a0To me, it sounds like something going on with his bladder.If you are in the UK, GOOD LUCK.\u00a0\u00a0From reading the posts on this website, you all seem to have a difficult time getting the care you need.",
