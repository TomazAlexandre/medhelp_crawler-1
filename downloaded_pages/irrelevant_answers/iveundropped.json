    "question": "I was dropping and noticing it little by little but today I have, for lack if better term or knowledge, undropped. I don't think I went all the way back up but at least halfway from where I was and where I dropped to. Is this supposed to happen? I didn't have this happen with my first an I know all pregnancies are different but I'm so worried about a c-section this time around from gestational diabetes that everything seriously concerns me now. Has anyone else had this? I'm 36+3 today",
