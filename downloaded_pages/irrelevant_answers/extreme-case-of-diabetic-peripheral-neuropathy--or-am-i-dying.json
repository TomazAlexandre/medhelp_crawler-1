            "answer": "Hello steeloyangster,I am a volunteer here and NOT a medical professional, so you should ALWAYS follow up with a doctor.My son was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 3.\u00a0\u00a0He is now 11 and very healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Sure, diabetes can be a pain in the u know what, but it is part of our daily life and we have a way to treat it.First I want to tell you that if you test your blood sugar and are 200 or higher, you should immediately make an appointment with a doctor to have tests performed.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes, whether type 1 or type 2 is not something to be ignored.\u00a0\u00a0I am not trying to reprimand you, but I am going to give it to you straight, if you are a type 1 diabetic (I am more familiar with type 1 than 2) your pancreas eventually stops producing insulin and without giving insulin whether it be shots or via an insulin pump, you WILL die.\u00a0\u00a0A type 1 diabetic cannot take herbs or natural remedies and live a long, healthy life.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is here to help you.You should make an appointment today.\u00a0\u00a0Not to be harsh, but if you are not already in serious danger, you will be if you ignore it.Insulin and certain medications are here on this earth for a reason....to help people live and stay healthy.\u00a0\u00a0There are certain diseases such as type 1 diabetes that CANNOT be conrolled with natural remedies.YOU CARED ENOUGH ABOUT YOURSELF TO POST HERE, SO NOW GET YOURSELF TO THE DOCTOR ASAP.If I did not give my son insulin and he died, I would be convicted of murder and would deserve the conviction.My son is a happy, healthy, compassionate, boy and would not be here today if he was not given insulin.Please keep us posted.SS",

            "answer": "I must agree with the previous two postings.. Blood sugar levels are considered normal between 70-126 (before meals). If you are having glucose readings as high as what you wrote, your body may be getting seriously damaged. Even if you are not developing complications such as neuropathy, your body may develop ketoacidosis and this can kill very quickly. If you do have neuropathy, it can be reversed in some cases IF glucose levels are brought back to normal quickly before the damage is severe. So you must get to a doctor quickly to find out what is going on. If you are a type 2 diabetic and not a type 1 (usually overweight), you may discover that you can treat this disease by losing weight and watching your diet and exercising, although you probably would be put on medications at first. So don't avoid the doctor because of fear of medicines... if you are a type 2 diabetic act quickly now, you may be able to normalize those glucose levels and then get back to a more careful lifestyle that is free of medicines.So don't give up and don't try to avoid doctors. You truly need to see a doctor quickly before something serious happens. Then you can get control of this issue if you are diabetic, and you can live to be an old person. I am a grandmother who has had diabetes since age 12, and i am healthy. So medicines that PRESERVE your good health are preferable to refusing medicines and having poor health.",

If you are truly a leader and the strong person your friends and family believe you to be you need to use that strength to get over your fear of seeing a doctor. I don't believe in giving a doctor complete control over my health and I never will.\u00a0\u00a0After all it is my health and I am very active in my own diabetes management.\u00a0\u00a0I actively participate and research every suggestion the doctor gives me to see if it works for the type of diabetic I am (everyone has different reactions to treatments).\u00a0\u00a0By not seeing a doctor you are limiting the amount of information you have to keep yourself healthy.\u00a0\u00a0And if there is a history of diabetes in your family are you \"leading\" others to not take care of themselves because they are now following your example? Please opt for the more information route....the more you have the better you can find the method of treatment that works best for you to manage your own glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0I would be dead if I had tried to manage this on my own with out a doctors help and the insulin I use to treat it.\u00a0\u00a0Take control and don't let this conquer you.",
