            "answer": "From the sounds of it, your doctor think she has Hypothyroidism. I think it'd be a good idea to have her antibodies checked (TgAb & TPO) when you go back to have her other levels checked (TSH and at least a Free T4)If her antibodies are elevated, the treatment is the same but you would know that your daughter has an auto-immune condition. Many hypothyroid patient's have what is called Hashimoto's Hypothyroidism.I would keep her on her meds and keep an eye on her. You need to know what she is feeling.If I had a child with hyper/hypothyroidism, I would invest in a blood pressure monitor with heart rate.I have an inexpensive omron and like it. I don't use the wrist one but one that goes around the arm.If you do this, enquire with a pediatrician what the average/normal B.P. & heart rate is for a child of 10 years of age.Best to you and yours, Karen.~Kate",

            "answer": "I agree with borninquisitive.\u00a0\u00a0I would just add that you might want to find a good pediatric endo who deals with thyroids to monitor her condition.\u00a0\u00a0It took a while for me to find one for my son (diabetic) but they are worth their weight in gold!\u00a0\u00a0Make sure one you find deals with thyroids though - just like regular endos, many specialize in diabetes, not thyroids.\u00a0\u00a0Keep an eye on her for depression too.",
