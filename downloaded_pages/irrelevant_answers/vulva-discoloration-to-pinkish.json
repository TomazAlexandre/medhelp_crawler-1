            "answer": "HiThanks for writing.In my opinion you are suffering from Pruritus Vulvae (Itchy Vulva), which is an acute or chronic disorder of the skin around the vulva (the vaginal lips) and anal region of women.It is due to various conditions like1)\tSkin disease, such as psoriasis, dermatitis, lichen simplex, lichen sclerosus or lichen planus.2)\tSystemic disease, such as diabetes mellitus.3)\tChemical irritants - Skin reaction to irritants, such as excessive sweat, toilet tissue, sanitary pads, detergents, fabric softeners, feminine sprays, ointments, creams, soaps, douches, deodorants, powders, perfumes, contraceptive foams and jellies and some types of fabrics. Irritant contact dermatitis is due to scratching, friction, soap, occlusive underwear or inappropriate chemical-medicinal applications.4)\tAn infection such as threadworm or pinworm (a parasitic infection mainly affecting children), scabies, candida (also called thrush), and some sexually transmitted diseases such as trichomoniasis, or gardnerella.You will need to check your blood sugar to know if you have diabetes. Yeast and fungal infections have been ruled out. Synthetic undergarments too cause vulval itch. You will need to rule out the cause one by one. Please consult a good skin specialist who will help you out with this.Meanwhile you can refer to: http://www.moondragon.org/obgyn/disorders/pruritusvulvae.htmlPlease keep me posted about the results and other development. If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries.",
