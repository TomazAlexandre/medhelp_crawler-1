            "answer": "I don't know specifically about an ovarian cyst making a behavior change but when a little munchkin has a fever, ear infection, a tooth breaking through, diabetes -one huge indicator is behavior. They get tired and crabby and all around emotional. So it's not a huge step to think that some of it could be from pain/stress of the cyst.Also sometimes you don't feel the full weight of the stress, but still feel stressed. Several months ago I thought I was doing fine, yeah lots of stress in my life, but I was managing. My period was almost 2 weeks late. Even a small amount of stress that you overlook can have a huge impact on your body. So it's possible she is just stressed out because of all of this- ovarian cysts, from what I've heard, really are unpleasant to say the least.HOWEVER if your hormones are off like pms your behavior can be irrational too. PCOS can cause ovarian cysts and does have a lot of hormonal issues with it. If she is feeling overly emotional, much worse than PMS and a crying Chunky Monkey night with a sappy movie, perhaps she should talk to her doctor about hormonal imbalances that could either cause her cyst(s), her behavior issues, or both.",

            "answer": "Absolutly. Some cysts (active) can secrete hormones- so if youre at the point in your cycle where your hormones are high anyways, like right when you ovulate- you're more likely to have EXTRA high hormones due to the cyst- so yes this can make you more emotional and anxious- if she has any thoughts of hurting herself or others, she should get to the closest ER for som eh elp.",
