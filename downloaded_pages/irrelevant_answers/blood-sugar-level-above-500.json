            "answer": "'if i stop to take insuline and found sugar 500 +, what can i do?'Do yourself a BIG favor, Google search 'Ignoring Complications of Diabetes' and 'How to manage/control high blood sugar', then hopefully you can make lifestyle adjustments to lower your glucose levels. Go see a diabetes nutritionist to learn and understand what you can and cannot eat. Finally, please do not stop or adjust your medication without your doctors consent. Doing so puts you at risk for serious health complications.",
