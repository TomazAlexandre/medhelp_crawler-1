            "answer": "Thanks. I was eating good, but fasted 10 hours before my 1 hour test, but completely cut down sugar and carbohydrate after the 1 hour result came. That keeps me worrying about what is safe to eat though my 3 hour result is good. Dr didnt refer me to nutrition expert, though asked me to cut down on sugar intake.",

            "answer": "Eating healthily is best for baby anyway! I was gestational diabetic last time and cutting out sugar was a rule for me to make sure baby didn't get too big. It's good that they've advised you to cut down on sugar (it'll also help you not gain too much weight during pregnancy ) I had gestational diabetes and it doesn't mean your baby will be diabetic at all. You also normally lose the diabetes after baby is born too.. If you have any other questions feel free to mail me as i've been through gestational diabetes with my previous pregnancy. x",

    "question": "I am 28 weeks now, my 1 hour glucose test result turned high, 171 against a normal of 139. Dr asked me to go for the 3 hour glucose test and results came normal. What does this mean? Can I eat like before or do I need to watch my diet? Why did my 1 hour result turn high if I dont have high sugar? Is it possible that it is because of something that I ate one or two days before the test? I do not want to end up having a diabetic baby! I have a lot of questions, if someone has any previous experience, please advise. Thanks in advance.",
