    "question": "Hi all,I have included a bunch of info on myself below. A member of your community recommended I come to this forum and ask for input. They recommended the Igenex lab test which I have no taken. All other Lyme disease tests came back negative that I had taken.Thank you in advance and please see below..Age: 26Weight: 173 lbsHeight: 5'10\"Lives in ConnecticutSymptoms:Brain fog, fatigue, lightheaded, extreme thirst, reaction to foods (inconsistent) and agitationTimeline/Description:I have had these issues for over 4 years... When I first started my job out of college, I would have random bouts with fatigue where I would have to go to my car and nap because I was so tired. As the years have gone on, this has grown more and more constant, to the point where I always have fatigue, brain fog, light-headedness and sometimes feel so \"out of it\" that I am afraid to drive.Over the past two years, I have begun experiencing excessive thirst (on top of the fatigue/fog) daily, which leads me to drink well over the recommended daily water intake.There are many times where the brain fog increases drastically following a meal but this is not always consistent. I find that when I am having a really bad day with brain fog, I am very agitated, fidgety and moody as well (not because I am not feeling well, seems more like another symptom).More and more I have been having reactions to foods/alcohol, to the point where I turn bright red, get itchy, face gets hot and I start to have a little trouble breathing which tends to go away within an hour or so. I spent over two years getting immunotherapy for external allergens, with no relief. I was also tested for food allergies but nothing came back positive.Other random issues that I have had over the past 4 years include increased sinus infections, ear aches and back drip, which never used to be issues for me.I take a multivitamin daily, vitamin b-complex and a probiotic.Doctors and Tests:I have had appointments with my primary care physician, ENT, Allergist, Naturopath, Endocrinologist and Pulmonologist. I have been tested for mono, Lyme disease, anemia, diabetes, thyroid and what seems like all of the \"go to\" tests when a doctor hears fatigue. I tested negative for diabetes and negative for all other initial endocrine system tests, with the doctor feeling confident that it was not an issue within her realm.The ENT did not see any issues with the sinuses but recommended immunotherapy. The allergist could not figure out why my two years of immunotherapy for external (dust, pollen, trees, grass) allergies did not help at all and did not believe food allergies was my issue.My Naturopath tested my B12 and other vitamin levels with no problems popping up. After her recommendation, I went on a two month anti-candida diet (cut out all yeast, sugar, alcohol, etc) as she thought it was a yeast build up in my intestines. I stayed on the strict diet for two full months and stopped once the stool tests came back negative for yeast. While I ate extremely healthy, cut out alcohol and lost 15 pounds, I felt no better than before.I am scheduled for a sleep test within the next two months but I feel that my lack of sleep quality is due to all of the issues I am having, not the other way around. Not to mention, a sleep issue doesn\u2019t seem to answer the excessive thirst problem.I am also seeing a Neurologist within the next month.I do not believe that I have depression, though I am starting to get slightly depressed seeing as these issues have gone on for so long and have been very debilitating.Who I Am:I have always been a hardworking, focused and career oriented individual who loves being around people and making others laugh. Over the past four years, I have slowly turned into someone who can barely focus on simple tasks (brain fog), has put his entire career on hold hoping to find a cure (too afraid to start a new job as I can barely focus) and someone who has not been his normal self. These issues have become more and more debilitating; to the point where my entire life has revolved around how I can just get back to feeling like my old self (I can't even remember what that is like anymore). I go to bed every night praying I will just wake up and feel better, only to wake up and immediately be hit with fogginess and fatigue. I am not a depressed or suicidal person, but I honestly don't know what I'd do if I looked back in 6 months and still felt this way and/or had no clear direction on how to find a cure.Thank you so much in advance for your help",
