            "answer": "I just finished 12 weeks of sovaldi and ribavirin on April 22 and had no side effects. I cross country skied 35 days this winter and rode my bike 650 miles in two weeks, including a 100 mile ride during vacation in Florida all while on treatment. I'm not sure about the simeprevir in terms of side effects but from what I have been reading here it doesn't sound like there is much difference. I was expecting something from the ribavirin after reading about all the potential side effects but it never happened. I think for many it has to do with how damaged one's liver is and how healthy one is going in to treatment. If you are fit and healthy you should be fine. Keep up the exercise as much as you can it will help you mentally and physically. Best of luck during treatment and after...think SVR!",
