            "answer": "I think that all OB's have different guidelines...When I was pregnant they tested me at 5 weeks b/c I have a strong family history of diabetes...I failed the 1 hour test with a result of 170....I had to go back for a 3 hour fasting test and my glucose prior to drinking that horrendous syrup was 110 and after the 3 hours was 118...My office used 120 as a guideline so I just made it......Anyway, as long as your Dr. says not to worry, then I would go by what they say......If you are really concerned then just try to cut back on all sugars, which includes carbs, as they convert to sugar once they are absorbed......Best of luck!",

            "answer": "I have Gestational Diabetes. I don't want you to get the wrong info so I have to chime in.\u00a0\u00a0All the girls that I know that have it are told to keep their blood sugar UNDER 120. We test 2 hours after each meal and once in the morning. We are all told to limit our CARB intake. My nutritionist said don't even bother looking at the sugar content, what matters is how many TOTAL CARBS you are taking in. Carbs turn into sugar basically. So my advice...limit the carbs that you are taking. It is better to be safe than sorry. For example, if you want to have a cheeseburger and fries, skip the fries and go for vegetables instead. Instead of having a sandwich for lunch, have a big salad with some chicken on it and maybe a glass of milk. You can have potatoes, just don't eat a whole baked potato. Eat half or a quarter of it. And certainly don't have a huge bowl of pasta...that will send your sugars through the roof.You technically didn't fail according to your doctor's office, but according to mine, you would have gestational diabetes. It is so much better to be safe than sorry. You can always purchase your own blood sugar monitors. They aren't that expensive and the pricking isn't bad at all.",
