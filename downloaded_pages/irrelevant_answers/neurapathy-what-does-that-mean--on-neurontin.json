Is this just part of taking the Neurontin until I get use to it?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I am only taking 300mg once a day then after 7 days I am to increase it to twice a day.I am really starting to worry about what it is that my Dr is trying to find.\u00a0\u00a0He said that I had a neuropath and schedule and EMG for the next day.\u00a0\u00a0The Neurologist had to cancel and I was reschedule for the 27th.\u00a0\u00a0Could I have MS?\u00a0\u00a0I am majorly fatigue, I am having burning in my legs, terrible back pain, I have a horrible time walking and only can walk a very short distance without leaning on something.\u00a0\u00a0If I continue to walk I get very shaky, like I am wobbly and I feel as if I am going to fall.\u00a0\u00a0The balls and toes of my feet tingle constantly.\u00a0\u00a0I know no one can give me a Dx here I guess I am looking for some insight.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr didn't say much to me and I was actually in shock when he took me seriously.\u00a0\u00a0All the others Dr blamed my weight on all my complaints.Also does anyone know what it means when the Dr pushes on your calf and tells you to push against him.\u00a0\u00a0He kept saying push, push and I was and it seemed as if the muscle in my calfs were shaking.\u00a0\u00a0I know this may be a stupid question but is that normal?",
