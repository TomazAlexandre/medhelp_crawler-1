            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.This sharp radiating pain is suggestive of peripheral neuropathy or nerve compression. Diabetes, B12 deficiency can cause neuropathy. Cervical disc herniation or cervical spondylitis can cause nerve compression. This requires further evaluation. Please consult a neurologist. Take care!",

    "question": "Okay, I'm 24 years old. I have 2 children, one adopted 7 year-old daughter and an 8-month old son. I was recently diagnosed with Graves' disease but have no underwent tx as of yet. I am otherwise healthy, slightly underweight, no drugs/ alcohol, no everyday medication, etc. I can remember having these pains (less traumatic) for some time now, but more recently, I have had this extremely sharp, crippling quick pain that begins on my right upper arm and radiates to my head area. I cannot really define where it ends up and the path in which it follows, but I do know for that 3-5 seconds, I am having a very difficult time. Can anyone direct me? Please?Thanks so very much.ALC",
