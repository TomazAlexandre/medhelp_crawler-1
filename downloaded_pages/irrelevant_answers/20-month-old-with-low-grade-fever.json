            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am not sure what tests were done but most labs offer a fever panel that investigates all causes of fever. In children often dehydration is the culprit. So when your son wakes up try and give him something to drink like lemonade, juice etc. Recurrent or chronic fever is seen in tuberculosis, SLE, rheumatoid arthritis, Polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) and other auto immune disorders, UTI, drug fever, sinusitis, glandular fever, otitis media, IBS, endocarditis, parasitic infestations, fungal infections, lymphomas and other cancers etc. Cancers and blood disorders have been ruled out. So other causes have to be looked into. Fever after stress or activity that becomes normal at rest is also seen in anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I had seen you say his temp was normal when he first woke up... I was wondering specifically the numbers- how much of a difference is it from the febrile state he gets to two hours later?\u00a0\u00a0CMV I believe can be passed from mother to child and is a source of recurring fevers.\u00a0\u00a0This might not be his problem, but have you ever been tested for this contagious virus?\u00a0\u00a0It's pretty common and can even be spread they say by coughing and sneezing.I believe in babies, their hypothalmus gland may not be quite mature yet.\u00a0\u00a0I know when a close relative of mine had her first baby they got literature about keeping the home environment at a constant temperature because of this.I do think you should press your doctor about what kind of infectious disease your child has.\u00a0\u00a0Then you can read up on it.\u00a0\u00a0It is not fair to you to not be informed about it, since you say he was diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0You could try to obtain a copy of his medical records and see if it says in there if they are refusing to tell you.",
