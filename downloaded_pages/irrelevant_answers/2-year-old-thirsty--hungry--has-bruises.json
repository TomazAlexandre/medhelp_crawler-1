    "question": "I am concerned about my 2 year old daughter--I called and spoke to the doctor's nurse yesterday about potty training and whether I should limit her fluid intake because she is constantly soaking her diapers.\u00a0\u00a0She drinks 55-60 ounces of water or milk daily, which I found out is about double what she needs.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor didn't seem concerned--just said she can slow down on drinking.I also noticed 5 small bruises on her legs...she always has some...but I attributed that to being a 2 year old!\u00a0\u00a0I have also noticed that her appetite has gone up in the last few weeks, but I assumed it was a growth spurt.Am I thinking too hard about this?\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't seem any more tired or irritable than normal.\u00a0\u00a0Are these symptoms of diabetes or any other problem anyone knows about?",
