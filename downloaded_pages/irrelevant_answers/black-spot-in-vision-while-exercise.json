            "answer": "Hi there. Do you see this visual distortion all the time or is it related to exercise only? If this is limited to the time when you exercise it could be due to dizziness due to hypotension, hypoglycemia etc. consult a physician for evaluation of hypertension and diabetes. Dehydration, fatigue or exercise on a fasting stomach could cause these symptoms along with iron deficiency anemia. If the floaters are, present all the time consult an ophthalmologist for ruling out retinal detachment and vitreous prolapsed. Hope this helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "Dr. Sharma-This is only limited to the time when I exercise and only when I am doing a certain move that requires rapid head movement. Thank you for your post I am definitely going to see a doctor should this symptom persist. I am also going to research the information you provided me with. Thank you.",

    "question": "I began doing a body weight aerobic class at the gym this is my second day of the class. The class is a bit intense and during mid workout we do about two sudden moves that require rapid head movement. When I do these two moves I see black blob like shading in the bottom lining of both eyes. Reminds me of when you put your hand or fingers on the screen of a plasma tv and it creates a black circle. I am not sure if maybe i'm working out to intensely and my body isn't used to it yet since its been a month since I got back into exercising or if it could be something to be more concerned about :o/",
