            "answer": "Hi,the tendency towards diabetes (type 2) is not curable, but the expression of that diabetes can be managed / cured by lifestyle (weigh loss, low carb eating, exercise), as long as you consider that you will be 'cured' only as long as you follow that lifestyle.Further diabetes is not a simple disease and some people will develop it regardless of how good their diet and lifestyle is (not that one shouldn't continue with that lifestyle), and may need medications as well.Also be aware that recommendations for healthy lifestyle change over time.\u00a0\u00a0However, I think that low carb eating (Low carb, moderate protein, higher fat) is definitely the way to go in diabetes where, after all, you have a defect in carbohydrate metabolism.Way of eating may be \"paleo\" or 'Primal\" if you want names.... amount of carb per meal is probably 15 - 50 g and mostly coming from\u00a0\u00a0non-starchy vegetables (no grains and very minimal sweet fruit).Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "That is correct.\u00a0\u00a0I am a Type II diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I will always be a Type II diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0But I control it entirely by diet only.\u00a0\u00a0I've been eating Paleo for 5 years now. My semi-annually A1C's average around 5.8.\u00a0\u00a0The idea is to avoid anything containing carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0Now, that's pretty hard to do, but with a little effort, you can minimize them.\u00a0\u00a0My diet is rich in eggs, cheese, meats, and nuts,\u00a0\u00a0Pounds and pounds of nuts; peanuts, walnuts, pecans, and almonds.\u00a0\u00a0I estimate that I easily consume 50 lbs. of various nuts annually.\u00a0\u00a0What I avoid primarily is anything \"white\".\u00a0\u00a0I don't eat pasta, or flour products with the exception of 2 slices of low carb bread (14G total) daily, rice, potatoes, or anything with added sugar is out.\u00a0\u00a0I stay clear of al juices.\u00a0\u00a0I eat strawberries and blueberries, but shun apples and oranges.\u00a0\u00a0There are tradeoffs:\u00a0\u00a0I yearn for a bagel and cream cheese.\u00a0\u00a0But instead, I have a hard boiled egg, and a plate of bacon.\u00a0\u00a0Vegetables!\u00a0\u00a0Piles of broccoli and Brussels, spinach, and salads.\u00a0\u00a0But no corn, peas, and beans.\u00a0\u00a0They're carb laden.\u00a0\u00a0I can live with this.\u00a0\u00a0Initially, I lost about 15% of my body weight. but I've plateaued in the recent years to a level weight.\u00a0\u00a0Along with diet, I exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I spin, walk and jog daily.\u00a0\u00a0I bought a gym quality spin bike for the house, and spin while I watch evening TV.\u00a0\u00a0The other thing I do is I check my blood glucose once a day, and the same time; when I walk in the door from work.\u00a0\u00a0If it's higher than yesterday, I am very careful.\u00a0\u00a0For me, it's like a competition.\u00a0\u00a0My attempt at diet control was initially met with great skepticism from my physician.\u00a0\u00a0But I convinced him to give me 90 days.\u00a0\u00a0In that period, I went from a 7.1 A1C to a 5.7.\u00a0\u00a0He was dumbfounded with the results.\u00a0\u00a0But It is possible\u00a0\u00a0for some of us to control without meds.I check my cholesterol every 6 months as well.\u00a0\u00a0I take a statin, which is why I might have turned type II in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0My total cholesterol is usually around 135 to 140 where it was formerly 215-220 without.\u00a0\u00a0I find myself to be an aspertame lab rat on this diet.\u00a0\u00a0I typically consume about 30 to 50 little blue envelopes of aspartame every week.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't seem to affect me.Humans were never designed to consume mass quantities of carbs..\u00a0\u00a0Carbohydrates were seasonal treats; gatherers collected raw honey, berries, and other fruits which were consumed on a seasonal basis when they were available..\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't a constant stream of carb laden food like it is today.\u00a0\u00a0Processing grains into flour has only been around for about 8000 years; a blink of the eye on the evolutionary time line.\u00a0\u00a0Our bodies have not yet adapted to processing large quantities of breads, pasta and flour products.You can do it, but it just takes a little effort.\u00a0\u00a0Initially I got into reading, and calculating the glycemic index of various foods.\u00a0\u00a0It was bewildering.\u00a0\u00a0Instead I just shun anything with high amounts of carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Initially, it requires a little label reading.\u00a0\u00a0But once you get it down, you know what to buy and what to pass on.",
