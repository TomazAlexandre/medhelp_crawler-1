            "answer": "As far as I'm aware neuropathy is not a symptom of HIV. I have been HIV+ for approximately 13 years. The only time I experienced neuropathy was three years ago when I underwent chemotherapy. It caused me to get neuropathy very bad. Though I've never had shingles before, but from talking with people who have had shingles it sounds very similar (constant burning feeling like your skin is literally on fire). If you are experiencing symptoms like that I would definitely recommend seeing a doctor and get checked out.",

            "answer": "i saw a doctor, he said it was just anxiety over my recent sexual encounters, but that it is too early to get tested for HIV.. it's a tingling in the left calf/foot, not really a burning... i've heard this is a symptom of nerve damage from many diseases such as HIV/AIDS and Diabetes",
