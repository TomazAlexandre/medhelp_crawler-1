    "question": "Dr. Keri Peterson was on the Today show this morning talking about how physicians should avoid ordering unnecessary medical procedures because they don't change outcomes. Her top 5 are:1. Don't routinely prescribe antiobiotics for sinus infections, which are most often caused by viral infections.\u00a0\u00a0Unless there is nasal mucous and/or sinus pressure or pain in the teeth lasting > 7 days.2. Don't image lower back pain within 6 weeks of onset, unless there are progressive neurologic symptoms incl. weakness or numbess of leg.3. Don't perform pap smears to women < age 21.\u00a0\u00a0Large majority of abnornal paps performed < age 21 will resolve on their own.4. Don't order EKG's for low risk patients (men < age 50, women < age 60, don't smoke, don't have high BP or high cholesterol or diabetes).5. Don't use bone density screening for pts\u00a0\u00a0age 50, drink excessive alcohol, smoke, excessively thin, calcium deficient, or if prolonged exposure to steroids.)I was surprised about # 3 and 5.\u00a0\u00a0I started getting paps as a teenager when I started the pill.I thought women were supposed to start bone density testing around onset of menopause.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not there yet, but did my first screening 2 years ago after my third round of steroids.\u00a0\u00a0Glad she mentioned that risk factor.Thoughts?",
