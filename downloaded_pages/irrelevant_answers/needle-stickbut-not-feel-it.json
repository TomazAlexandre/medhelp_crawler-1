            "answer": "You probably would have felt it, especially since you were forcefully bending the needle. However, insulin needles are very small so it is possible to get stuck and not feel it.Even if you were stuck and did not feel it, that does not mean you have contracted a bloodborne disease. To beging with, your grandmother would have to have a bloodborne disease in order to give one to you. If she has none, you cannot get one (from her).If you are still concerned, talk with your doctor and get tested for Hepatitis and HIV.In the future, it would be advisable to NOT recap needles and NOT throw them in the ordinary garbage can. There are \"sharps\" containers that are specifically manufactured for the disposal of needles and syringesand the reason they exist is to prevent people from accidentally sticking themselves (either while recapping the needle or while handing the \"trash.\"Ask your pharamcy where to get a sharps container.Here are a couple of links to information on sharps disposal:http://www.epa.gov/osw/nonhaz/industrial/medical/disposal.htmhttp://bd.com/us/diabetes/page.aspx?cat=7002&id=7414http://www.sharpsdisposal.com/",

    "question": "I hope I am just being overly worried.\u00a0\u00a0I am taking care of my grandmother and give her insulin. A few nights ago the cap fell and we could not find it so I took the end of the needle wrapped it in napkins, bent the needle back against the side of the garbage can and tapped it (to avoid a garbage man getting stuck).\u00a0\u00a0 Now I did not feel anything while doing this nor did I have any spots that seemed to be bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0But afterwards I started to question with the needle being hidden in the napkins and taped if I was careful enough to make sure I did not get stuck.\u00a0\u00a0So my question is if I would have been stuck would I have felt it?\u00a0\u00a0I am 30yo and have no health problems so I have normal sensitivity in my fingers.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
