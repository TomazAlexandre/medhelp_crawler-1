I can no longer take my heart meds for high blood pressure and irregular hb; topomax for migraines; metaphormin; and a few others. Which I quit taking some of my meds before pregnancy because I did a lifestyle change in which it helped enough that I could quit taking the extra meds. As far as C-section...both my boys were early but big because of the diabetes (not gestational) and I could not have them natually so this is another C-section baby.",

            "answer": "The doc did regular blood tests for most and since changing a lot of things as far as food and exercise we found I did not need most of them. He took me off the others because they are harmful to the baby during pregnancy and said that if any problems arise he will put me on something safer but most of the safer meds are only safe after the first trimester. Every time I have been pregnant though they always take me off my metaformin and put me on insulin saying it is safer for the baby.",
