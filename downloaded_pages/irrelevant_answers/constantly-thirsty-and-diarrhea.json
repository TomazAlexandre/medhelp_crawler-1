            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Excessive thirst is medically called polydipsia. It can be due to several causes. The treatment will depend on the cause. Hence first the cause has to be found out. Polydipsia can be primary or secondary. It can also be psychogenic. One can feel very thirsty for hours together after a spicy or salty meal. Diarrhea, excessive sweating, exposure to excessive heat and sun can all cause polydipsia.This can also be the result of diseases like diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Heart, liver and kidney failure and also certain medications cause excessive thirst.Some people with severe acidity too develop a habit of drinking water to counteract the effect of acidityIn your case, probably chronic diarrhea has precipitated increased thirst. Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
