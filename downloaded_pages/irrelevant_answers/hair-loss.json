Maybe more than just thyroid too - you could have your adrenals stressed out and sending you mixed signals.This is not good if they are only testing your thyroid. HAve they done an ACTH test for adrenals? You need those looked at.",

            "answer": "Yes get them... its a cr@p shoot to just assume things without actually getting your labs. If you get them you can analize each test online to find things out yourself.I had a full panel of labs that I had to dig apart. They spend maybe 15 minutes looking at them and sending the results. I spent hours taking each one and combining it with the others to find my fault.",

Simple things like insulin, IV fluids, basic stuff to start and then find out WHY. Most of the time it was an infection or flu. It's scary that they can miss things that can change your life.

            "answer": "Most times the hair loss from alopecia can be fixed with the hair folicles being stimulated by cortisone cream for a few weeks.As much as I hate cortisone cream, I used it years ago after a haematoma (blow to the back of the head and blood clot) as my hair just wouldnt stop falling out.Within weeks it had grown back , it grew back short and spikey at first (fuzzy) but then grew back normal.Take Care and I hope your stress levels subside very soon for you.",

I covered my legs with Lots of Cortisone and had big problems with my blood sugar. The doctors couldn't say for sure that it was the cortisone but they said that it could affect blood sugar levels. I'll look into it. Thank you again.",
