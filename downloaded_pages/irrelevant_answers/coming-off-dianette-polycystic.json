            "answer": "No, you cannot wean off the pill. You should either take it or not.I suggest trying another pill like Yasmin which has Drospirenone and lower estrogen than Dianette or Yaz which has even lower amount of estrogen than Yasmin which act similarly to Dianette but may give you less side effects because of the lower estrogen.You can also help achieve balance by exercising, eating right and reducing stress.With PCOS I will give you the same advice that I gave to cooselal:\"You need to have a complete assessment of your hormones including FSH, LH, Estradiol, Prolactin, TSH, DHEAS, Testostoerone, 17OH-progesterone, fasting insulin, a 2 hour GTT with a 75 gram glucose challenge, lipid panel, kidney functions and liver functions.\u00a0\u00a0Women with PCOS have an increased risk for diabetes or glucose intolerance or insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0If you are obese with increased body mass index and if you lose weight, exercise and eat a good glycemic index diet then you can improve your PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0If you have diabetes or glucose intolerance then Metformin can help you as well to control your blood sugars. Therefore there is a lot you can you with diet, exercise, weight loss to improve your condition. If you are not obese and do not have any of the glucose intolerance issues then it is more difficult because weight loss will obviously not help.Alternative approaches like acupuncture and chinese herbal medicine from an acupunctuist who specializes in women's health can also be an option for youlI suggest seeing a reputable specialist called a Reproductive Endocrinologist to help you get started. \"",
