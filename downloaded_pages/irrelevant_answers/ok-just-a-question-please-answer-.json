            "answer": "Hey. The same has happened to be..but I have Gestational diabetes and that's the reason my baby is bigger than he should be. He is also a week bigger than what he's supposed to be. And they did not change my due date either. If anything you may have your baby a week early which most people want anyways. Good luck! And I wouldn't sweat it as long as you have a healthy baby the due date doesn't matter..it will be around the date they gave you though. .it's rarely ever on the due date..",

            "answer": "At 31wks my baby was in the 83rd percentile at 4lbs13oz.\u00a0\u00a0I think thats measuring about 10days ahead. If due date was confirmed early on, after 20wks they don't tend to change your due date. They're more likely to look at the weight tracking and if its consistent you could just be having a big baby, and if not then they may look at causes such as gd. I don't have gd either, just big babies :)",
