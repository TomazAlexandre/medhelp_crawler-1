            "answer": "These could represent either cervicogenic migraines, or muscular tension headaches. The neck musculature contributes to our sense of stability, and can lead to dizziness in some patients if there is a problem. If the CT scan is negative a MRI of the cervical spine may be helpful to exclude structural problems. If the scans are negative and these are believed to be head due to the cervical musculature, then neck physiotherapy may be of benefit. Another possibility for chronic daily headaches include rebound headaches from medication overuse. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Headaches are sometimes a sign of too much of a chemical exposure of some kind.\u00a0\u00a0Did you start doing anything differently about the time they started?\u00a0\u00a0Painting, or cleaning or mechanical work or house remodeling?Some of these are symptoms such as you hear with those exposed to the ethylene glycol monobutyl ether chemicals... especially with being so tired.The first set of blood tests do show normal, and that is why nothing else is checked.\u00a0\u00a0However, if this is the culprit, the bone marrow compensates for what would otherwise be hemolytic anemia.The hemolysis can be found as early as 2.5 days after exposure.\u00a0\u00a0You often will have burning eyes like hot pokers were in them; flu like symptoms, dark urine and horrible fatigue that doesn't seem to go away ... then other neurological problems.\u00a0\u00a0With this chemical you can expect to see all the time depression, suicidal tendencies, short term memory loss, difficulty sleeping and difficulty concentrating.The add on blood test called a retic ratio and the CBC with differentials will show up this often overlooked form of fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Ask for the size and shape of the red blood cells.\u00a0\u00a0These won't be OK if this chemical has harmed you, whereas other blood tests, those typically done, will be at least borderline ok for most people.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm 23 and from the UK. I've been having regular headaches for about 6 months, there doesn't seem to be any real pattern to them except they are usually at the back of my head (either side). I also get a tingling sensation up the back of my neck and head in certain positions, especially when sat forwards. More recently I've been feeling tired and having dizzy periods which worsen when moving my head around. I've had blood and diabetes tests which are normal. I have insisted on having a CAT scan, although the Dr. seems sure it won't show anything. Any advice would be appreciated.",
