            "answer": "Well, unfortunately, this is a patient forum and we can't diagnose over the internet.\u00a0\u00a0Have you not had any autoimmune testing as of yet?\u00a0\u00a0It must be so frustrating for you not knowing what's going on.I too had severe endometriosis and a complete hysterectomy.\u00a0\u00a0Did you ever have a lack of ovulation?\u00a0\u00a0If so, along with your hypothyroidism (which slows metabolism), did they ever rule out a pituitary tumor with a dynamically done pituitary MRI, with and without contrast?\u00a0\u00a0I don't have the hypothyroidism, but had another symptom that led to testing and an MRI where they found a microadenoma.\u00a0\u00a0Pituitary tumors are quite common and can adversely affect one's life in a number of ways.\u00a0\u00a0Migraines can be, according to one article, a symptom.I have migraines also.\u00a0\u00a0Your migraines, your slow motility including gastroparesis- are these things your doctor pieced together to say you had dysautonomia?Are you taking any preventative medication for your migraines?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have an abortive medication/medications for your migraines?Are you taking medication to speed gastric emptying for your gastroparesis?You say you have neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I have a parent who was tested for peripheral neuropathy and the neurologist who tested said they are only able to determine a cause in a certain percentage of cases (don't remember the exact number, but there was a significant number that weren't covered).\u00a0\u00a0For my parent, they found monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (M.G.U.S.).\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is something commonly associated with peripheral neuropathy- they likely ran an HgA1c test on you and ruled that out or no?On prurigo nodularis, have you seen this article?http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1088032-overviewHow's your kidney function?You mention plates and pins- did they test you to be sure you weren't allergic to the components those plates and pins were made of or are they made of material which isn't known to cause allergies in anyone?",

            "answer": "First of all thank you for responding to my post. Okay my ankle surgery I had done in 1994, the plates and pins were removed, but they did miss one screw which is still in there. I have MRI's done every two years because I have Cavernous Angiomas in the Lower Left Hemisphere of my brain, so they have to monitor these for fear of bleeding. I have had Hypo Thyroidism for many years. I have been on the same med for all these years as well. My Neuropathy is in my feet, I had an EMG, I believe it was called and it was then that the Neurologist diagnosed me with it. I take Zomig for my migraines. Tumors in my brain have never been discussed but I do have MRI's every two years. For my motility issues I take Domperidone from Canada and I take Dexilant for the reflux and Glyco for the constipation. I am having a very hard time right now with my motility issues, extreme bloating, nausea, gas and bad reflux. My skin issues I totally believe play big part in this whole picture. Thank you again for your response.",

My Neurologist didn't do any other testing on me. Also no tests have been done re: Endocrine Hormones, I have never heard of that. My migraines are at bay for the moment. I see my GI doctor in a couple of weeks thank heavens.",

            "answer": "So, have you had any genetic and autoimmune type testing?Regarding endocrine hormones, you mentioned hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0The thyroid hormones and the pituitary hormone known as TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) are just some of a number of endocrine hormones.\u00a0\u00a0I am kind of surprised an endocrinologist never did a complete work-up after the hypothyroidism was discovered.\u00a0\u00a0You might ask your endocrinologist if they would consider doing a thorough endocrine work-up.Insulin is another endocrine hormone, which is supposed to be produced by the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0When a person has diabetes, where the insulin is not working/working the way it should, neuropathy in the feet is a symptom that can develop out of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The test that is commonly used today to check for diabetes is HgA1c also known as HbA1c- this gives a longer window of looking at how blood sugar is in the body compared to a brief snap shot in time approach, such as a fasting blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is only one of the known causes of peripheral neuropathy... there are others that should have been tested for by that neurologist in addition to testing for this.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you will pursue getting tested with a thorough neurologist for the known causes of peripheral neuropathy so they can either rule them out or locate the cause of yours in your feet.You mention you try to stick to a no sugar diet- what led to this sort of diet for you?I'm thankful your migraines are at bay right now and that you have a GI appointment!",
