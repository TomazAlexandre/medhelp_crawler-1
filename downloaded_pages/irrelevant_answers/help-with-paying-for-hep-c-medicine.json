            "answer": "Both HCV drug manufacturers provide patient assistance programs to help with the cost of meds; you should call them even if they state publicly that they only cover patients that are uninsured; they previously also covered those that are under insured.These numbers might be a bit dated, so if they don\u2019t work be sure to Google search the programs by name and you\u2019ll get new phone numbers if needed:Pegassist (Roche Pegasys system): 1-866-422-2377Commitment to Care (Schering- Plough PEG-Intron system): 1-800-521-7157I had both Medicare and supplemental insurance, and Commitment to Care covered all my meds 100%; no copays, deductibles, etc.Good luck and let us know how things work,Bill",

            "answer": "I'm one of those \"no medical insurance\" gals too and currently on the Pegassist program and get the shots and meds at no charge but I am responsible for the blood work and dr. office calls during treatment. Ask your dr or nurse for the application and they will submit it for you or call them directly (Bill has included the phone # above, the correct # is the Genotech not Roche).If you haven't had a biopsy yet go to your local hospital and apply for assistance there before you go in. I was unaware of such a program when I had mine but they have made arrangements for a 5 year payment plan.Yes, the cost of having Hep C is expensive but the cost of NOT getting treatment is even higher.My heart goes out to you and your kids, just know you are not alone in this.
