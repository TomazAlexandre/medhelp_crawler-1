            "answer": "With a number of patients diabetes medication taken on an empty stomach may cause stomach discomfort. Have you spoken with your doctor about this? It could be unrelated to diabetes yet related to an ulcer, an intestinal tract infection, gall bladder stone, pancreas issues, etc.As far as cinnamon helping to lower glucose levels, the answer is no. Returns from the past 5-7 years of various studies/research and clinical trials concluded cinnamon does not lower glucose levels. It does, however, provide other powerful antioxidant properties. If you ingest honey be sure to test 2-3 hours later. Honey in some diabetics has the same reaction as refined sugar - jacks up the glucose level.",
