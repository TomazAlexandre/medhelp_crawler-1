            "answer": "Hi,To answer your first question,breasts are programmed to begin making milk during pregnancy. If a woman is not pregnant,the breasts can also be \u201ctricked\u201d into making milk if her hormone balance imitates what is seen in pregnancy. Usually, even if the liquid is colored yellow, greenish, gray, or brown instead of being purely clear or white, the liquid is \u201cactually milk\u201d that can be of any consistency that has been made by the breast. Breast discharge can be caused by a wide range of disorders,most are not worrisome, but if you are having this problem,I would suggest seeing your doctor and ask for some type of tests,particularly if the discharge is unilateral. These tests will help determine if the condition is normal or abnormal.As for your second question on how it might affect men who ingest the discharge,in my opinion, I don\u2019t think it could cause obesity,bloating\u00a0\u00a0or diabetes.However,the best source of information and opinion would be their own treating doctors.Take care..",

            "answer": "Just to add a note to Zouzi's excellent response\u00a0\u00a0.... if you are so very concerned about the relationship between your breast discharge and your partner I suggest that he STOP ingesting the fluid and ask your Dr. if he/she would consider sending some of the drainage for Pathological Studies to determine it's content. Let me assure you that ingestion of breast discharge DOES NOT cause the problems and/or diseases that you mention are affecting your partner. I might suggest that he also see a Dr. about the symptoms you stated.\u00a0\u00a0I see nothing in your post that would be related in any way to Breast Cancer.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Regards ....",
