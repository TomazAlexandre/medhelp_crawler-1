            "answer": "I'm pretty sure I have floaters as well, but that's just an eye problem that is perfectly normal and harmless. It's not related to diabetes..at least from what I've heard and read.As for the night sweats, patches, etc.. I've heard that patches is a symptom of diabetes. As is itching, dry skin, frequent urination, and extreme hunger. Do you have any of those symptoms?Just go to your family doctor to make sure! And they'll do a couple blood tests so you don't have to worry anymore.It seems like you're in good health so you may not even have it!What exactly do they mean when they said 'onset' diabetes. Borderline?",

            "answer": "Thank you for responding.Onset Diabetes is a precurser to Adult Type II.\u00a0\u00a0Most people have onset diabetes for years... Up to even 10 years before they get the Type II and have to control it with medication.\u00a0\u00a0Most people don't even know they have it.\u00a0\u00a0Their fasting, and I mean fasting for at least 8 to 10 hours, blood glucose level is higher than 115.\u00a0\u00a0Mine was consistantly above that.Floaters not in the sense of the round little tiny circles that we all see, but floaters like a long stand of some sort... Almost like a peice of lint floating across my eye. I have read somewhere that they are a sign of diabetes.I don't have extreme hunger, nor am I thirsty all the time, nor do I have to go to the bathroom frequently, nor do I get frequent headaches.\u00a0\u00a0That is what is weird. The Dr. asked me how often at night do I go and I said maybe 1 time.\u00a0\u00a0He said someone with diabetes would go more like 3-5 times.\u00a0\u00a0However, night sweats, red and sometimes itchy patches, fatigue are symptoms... And this cold... I've had it for 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Can't shake it.",

            "answer": "Ahh I never even knew that someone could have the onset for 10 years and then finally have it if not taken care of!I never knew that about floaters either! Sometimes when Im looking outside *and this is only when im out* I'll see things like little circles or light gray/black strands floating. I don't know if that's in my head and caused from my anxiety or if im actually seeing it! I've recently had an eye exam. Wouldn't that be something they could actually see?As for your cold, have you been to the doctors? They can prescribe you something to see if it helps.",

    "question": "I am 35 and for the last couple of months I have awoken with a stiff and sore neck. It doesn't really go away through out the day. I've switched pillows, slept w/o a pillow just to see if it would help, but no...I have been told by the doctor I have onset diabetes. My fasting blood sugar was somewhere between 115-145 last 3 or 4 times I've been tested. I am suppose to get tested every 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0I do get night sweats of various degrees. Some nights are drenching, and some are just cold sweats. I assume this is associated with the diabetes. PHYSICALLY: I am not over-weight or out of shape. I'm 6' 2\" and about 195-200lbs. SKIN ISSUES: I have red dry patches on my arms and get boils.\u00a0\u00a0I am always tired, but I get up to put the dog out and to put the 2yr old back to sleep. So my sleep is always disrupted and with a 2nd baby on the way, I don't see that getting better.Christmas I had the 24-48 hr stomach flu. About a week later I got a cold - sore throat, cough, congestion. That hasn't gone away. I've taken Zicam and Tylenol Cold and it didn't do a thing. I first thought allergies? But nothing as far as eating habits, weather or environmental factors have really changed.Now, can all of these symptoms be related to the diabetes? What is bothering me is I presently have 3 brothers and neither parent, aunt, uncle or sibling has or had diabetes. Just my Grandpa when he was in his upper 50's along with various other issues like heart disease... He was out of shape.\u00a0\u00a0However, my mother did have MS but passed away when I was 17.",
