            "answer": "It could be from anything. Measuring through the tape is VERY inaccurate and for now you shouldn't worry too much. Babies position, your own body size/weight gain, fluid amount, babies size, etc. I was 33 weeks and measured to be 27 with a tape. Had an ultrasound, she showed to be 32 weeks 6 days and was 4 pounds as an estimated weight. Try not to worry about it too much. I'm sure everything's fine.",
