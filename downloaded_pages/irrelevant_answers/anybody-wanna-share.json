    "question": "I'm measuring two weeks ahead and getting an ultrasound at my next appointment to check on our baby boy. Anybody measure ahead and either had to or didn't have to get induced early because of it? I'm trying\u00a0\u00a0to figure my odds and get a perception of what might have to happen. Background info is I have gestational diabetes. I wasn't measuring ahead the whole pregnancy I just started measuring two weeks ahead when I went to my 34 week appointment. So I'm just wondering anybodies experiences who can try and help me get some perception. Thank you!",
