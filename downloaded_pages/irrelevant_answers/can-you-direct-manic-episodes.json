            "answer": "My manias most manifest as potential energy that *has* to be used. Otherwise it's quite painful, physically and mentally. I'm found that deep cleaning the house is a great help. It uses my muscles, and takes the energy and gives it a positive direction to flow.If I'm in too bad of shape physically to do any physical work (I'm physically disabled with status migrainous) then I've found that listening to different kinds of music can help take the energy away. I start out by listening to things like metal, dance, and anything that has a very driving beat. I then gradually ramp down my music to rock, then soft pop, and then finally new age. It often works. I have several different playlists on my computer for my different levels of mania. If you can create some relatively small playlists, you could store them on your mp3 player, and be able to listen to the music wherever you are, while still doing other things that need to be done.Good luck and let us know how you're doing,~Dame",

            "answer": "I have hypomania, but have learned through therapy to S..L..O..W myself down.\u00a0\u00a0I slow my movements, speech, and try to slow thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0I also listen to music, but don't start out with stuff that hypes me up more.\u00a0\u00a0I go straight to whatever relaxes me.\u00a0\u00a0Something else I discovered works for me is watching my computer slideshow of family pics...lots of my grandkids; diverts my thoughts and relaxes me.\u00a0\u00a0Gardening helps, too.\u00a0\u00a0I can piddle in my garden, also a relaxing activity that helps slow me down.\u00a0\u00a0What you need to try to avoid is starting \"projects\" that you think you're going to finish...then go to another, and another, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Experiment and find what helps you slow down - movement, speech, thoughts, activity, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
