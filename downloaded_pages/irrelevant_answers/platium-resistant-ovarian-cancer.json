    "question": "Hi Doctor,I am wondering if my mom is doing the best thing for her.She was diagnosed with ovarian cancer stage IIIC in April 07.\u00a0\u00a0There was no residual after surgery and no lymph node involvement.\u00a0\u00a0She completed 6 rounds of taxol/cisplantinum ending in Oct 07.\u00a0\u00a0We found out in may of 08 that the cancer had spread to her liver and there are some now lesions to her peritoneum.\u00a0\u00a0She then did 3 rounds of carbo/gemzar.\u00a0\u00a0We found out last week that the last round of chemo did not help and the disease is more advanced in her liver and the other lesions have grown.\u00a0\u00a0Her oncologist then started her on IV cytoxen and we now know that she is platium resistant.I then called an oncologist in another town (2.5 hours away) who accepted mom.\u00a0\u00a0He would like to start Avastin infusions every 3 wks and have mom take cytoxen and methotrexate in pill form between avastin infusions.\u00a0\u00a0We are more optomistic with the chemo that he suggested and I would like your opinion on this.Mom's CA 125 has correlated with all of the events until last week.\u00a0\u00a0At diagnosis, it was 506, it was 6 after the first round of chemo, then is was\u00a0\u00a014 3 months after theat.\u00a0\u00a0It was 20 at recurrance, 101 the day she started carbo/gemzar, and 51 the last day of carbo/gemzar.\u00a0\u00a0Do we now not look at the CA125 since the last one did not correlate with the abd/pelvis CT?Mom is still very active and on the move all of the time.\u00a0\u00a0She helps babysit my 2yr old and my 11 month old.\u00a0\u00a0She is also raising my mentally challenged nephew and is guardian to an aunt in a nursing home.\u00a0\u00a0Her liver enzymes are normal and she shows no signs of the disease.\u00a0\u00a0She feels bad after chemo, but after a few days, she is back to herself.\u00a0\u00a0She does have a history of a-fib and insulin dependent diabetes.(just started lantus last month).What are your ideas/comments/concerns for our situation.Thank you so much for your time,Jamie",
