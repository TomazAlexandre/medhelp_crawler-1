            "answer": "I had it too and made the same mistake. Don't Google it! Haha. Mine was due to my gestational diabetes and I was almost so hight they were going to do a c-section at 36 weeks. But once I got my sugar levels under control the fluid went down and has stayed down. They also can drain some of the fluid off if they need to being that you are so early. My doctors had no concerns about her development only concerns about my water breaking. When you have too much they want to do a controlled water break where they do it to avoid complications. But it is common, once I mentioned it to friends I was amazed how many of them had it too. You will be fine :)",

    "question": "Hi, I was told at a growth scan today that I have increased levels of Amniotic Fluid - I am 28 1day. The consultant told me that it could be nothing but has arranged a Glucose Tolerance Test next week as a symptom of Gestational Diabetes is increased fluid (baby measured on the large side but within the 'acceptable' limit so doc not concerned). Of course, I did the wrong thing - and looked up high levels of amniotic fluid on the internet. I found out it is uncommon and there could be a problem with the baby's swallowing. I'm now a bit scared! Has anyone else had experience of this?",
