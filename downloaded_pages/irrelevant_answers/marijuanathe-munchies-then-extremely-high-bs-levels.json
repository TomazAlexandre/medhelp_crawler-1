    "question": "Hello everyone. I hope all of you are finding solutions to your problems. I am still searching..To make a\u00a0\u00a0long story short, I will be completely truthful about my situation.FIRSTLY; I love marijuana. I'm a Type 2. For the past four months, I've been smoking, and I have never been able to control my eating after I smoke since. My BS levels are always 200+ when I wake up(after continuously eating JUNK during the night after the smoke). Therefore, it is possible that right after eating im 300+. I cannot understand why I always want the sweetest or the most forbidden junk food when Im high.SECONDLY; My visit to my Doctor 3 weeks ago revealed the expected. An HbA1c Level of 7.2%. Cholesterol level of 213.I have never had my HbA1c over 6.2% before. My cholesterol was never a problem.These problems obviously arised after all my uncontrolled sugar levels during the munchies I always get.SITUATION: When I don't smoke...I am probably a role model diabetic girl. Meaning, I exercise 4 times a week, I eat very well balanced meals..to the point where people think I am a health-freak. My diabetes was never a problem before I began smoking.The problem with me is, I am having a hard time accepting the fact that smoking pot is adversly affecting me. I know I am going to pay for it. I really love marijuana...and at the same time, I love myself too much to keep letting the munchies affect my BS. It is almost like I am a completely DIFFERENT person when I smoke...like a greedy-sweet-eating-monster. No joke.Can someone who's been through this before, please help me",
