            "answer": "\"I am going for a MRI and spec scan to see how my blood flows.\"The noninvasive test to check blood flow is reactive hyperemia peripheral arterial tonometry (RH-PAT). The MRI is of the abdomen possibly to look for enlarged organs? A SPECT scan [single-photon emission computerized tomography] lets the doctor know how blood flows to your heart and areas of your brain.There's serious health issues going on for these to be ordered, something you need to discuss with your doctor in-depth. Good luck",

If you want to see an Doctor for your diabetic condition, only see an endo.Good luck",

    "question": "I went for a CDL physical way back in 2004 and was told i had diabetes.Of course i had no insurance at the time so i said what was i to do,said ill ignore it till i get insurance.From 2004-2008 i ignored it and did not eat right.I finally started to notice the effects starting in 2008 with my breathing and circulation and still ignored it all the way up to dec 2011 when my body said i had enough and bed ridden me with dizzyness.My feet are always cold and im dizzy 24/7 and i am physically exhausted all the time and just feel terrible.My eyes are mad blurry with floaters and my right ear rings constantly.I was started on metformin and lisinopril and lipitor.I have made a promise to myself to eat right exercise and now take care of myself cause im only 39 and got alot of livin to do.I did this to myself but what im askin is how long will my body take to recover from years of abuse.I am going for a MRI and spec scan to see how my blood flows.Does anybody else have a similiar story and what were your results.I get this feeling that i really messed myself up bad and i wont recover",
