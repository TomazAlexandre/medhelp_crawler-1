    "question": "Hey all.For the last year, my stomach has constantly been bloating every day. In the morning, when i wake up, my stomach is flat. But as the day goes by, it bloats to a point where it is extremely huge. People have related the size to the stomach of a pregnant woman, mine being the size of a pregnant woman's stomach at 5 months.When i drink a glass of water or eat even the smallest amount of food, my stomach enlarges to an extreme size. People have told me that this is just because i ate and it happens to everybody, but i highly doubt this. I doubt this because of the size of the bloating and the fact that just eating 10 peanuts will make it so large.What can i do to fix this? it makes me really uncomfortable in the sense that i look really fat with it and i tend to be conscious of my appearance. I am also worried about my health and i don't want to be like this forever.Why is my stomach bloating like this and what can i do? Is it different for people of different ages? i am 16 and a maleThank you to everyone who answers.",
