    "question": "I am an active female I walk between 30- 40 miles at the rate of 4 m/hr and eat a healthy 2000 calorie diet. I participate in dog sports and am very active. I have not change my diet or exercise.In the past recent months I have gained 20 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0My previous weight was 144 I now weigh 164 and I am 5 8\". The weight gain is around my belly area, an odd place for me to carry weight. It seems like I have PMS bloating all the time. I was at 144 for the past 4 years.I have edema in the hands, they get very cold and numb when exercising, the numbness has spread to my entire arms, could not feel pressure etc. It takes several hours for the feeling in my arms to return. Also, when the swelling does go away my joints in my hand are very tender and they get tenderer each time they swell. My hands also seem weaker. My grip is not as strong and when someone shook my hand I winced in pain.I also seem to be losing muscle mass, or have exercise intolerance. It feels like each time I walk, ( I walk 4-7 miles a day) it is like I have never walked before my legs are screaming in pain, my knees hurt etc, I am so tired, I even get sleepy. My legs ache all the time now and are extremely heavy feeling. It is like my body is deconditioning itself.My blood pressure used to be 100/60 and now is\u00a0\u00a0138/92, my pulse rate is running about 115 when previously it was in the 60-70 range.My history includes removal of the ovary and fallopian tube a year ago. The ovary was an Ovarian Fibroid Thecal Tumor, meigs syndrome. I was completely recovered in 8 weeks. I walked better with less pain 4 weeks after the surgery, than I do now.I am currently on the nuva ring and my menstrual cycle is irregular.I will say that autoimmune disorders run on both sides of the family. My father\u2019s sister died of lupus/heart disease, my father has diabetes, my father\u2019s sister has hypothyroidism, and on my mother\u2019s side my aunt has Raynuads and a vascular disorder.Lab results on Part 2 look for more",
