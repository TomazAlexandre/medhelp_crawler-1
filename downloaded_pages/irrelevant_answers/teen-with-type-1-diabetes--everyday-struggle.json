            "answer": "I'm so glad you posted here. Yes, you do need to get your blood sugar under control but sometimes it's not so easy to do that without help especially when you're young. I'm going to send you a private message with a website that has special forums for young people and you can talk with other people going through what you are. I also suggest that if you aren't already getting help with your depression you do that. Depression can make it hard to do even the simplest things, let alone the complicated day to day management that diabetes entails. It's easy to get overwhelmed and just give up. Talk to your doctor about perhaps prescribing you medication meds and then ask to be referred to a therapist (usually depression needs both meds and therapy to really get better). Best of luck to you and let us know how you are doing.",

            "answer": "There are lots of websites with more detailed suggestions about snacks, but in general some good snacks are things that are lower in carbs, but higher in protein such as nuts or nut butters, cheese, and cold cuts. I'm not sure why you are worrying about UTI's. If she has had these you need to consult your doctor.",
