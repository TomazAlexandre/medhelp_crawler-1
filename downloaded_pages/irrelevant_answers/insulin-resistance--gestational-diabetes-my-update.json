            "answer": "Hi Diva,congrats on your baby boy.I am about 9 weeks on and have just been diagnosed with gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Early!The diet plan calls for small regular meals (these should be about 6 times a day).\u00a0\u00a0Each meal should contain high fibre complex carbs (like brown rice, pasta, sweet potato, whole wheat bread etc), protein and fat.No sugar allowed at all. So no sweets of any kind.\u00a0\u00a0Only small amount of fruit allowed and only with a larger meal.The meals really are quite small, but one feels like one is always eating (about every 3 hours).I am supposed to have a last snack late at night before I sleep.\u00a0\u00a0If my morning blood sugar is still high, they will want me to wake up for a 3 am snack to see if this gets things down...Anway just started this diet and too early to tell yet.\u00a0\u00a0But hopeful I can postphone insulin as long as possible.Sally",

    "question": "Hi all - Im almost 35 weeks and my pregnancy has been very good with no major drama's. Baby is gonna be big more than likely, his heads engaged and he looks well. I was diagnosed with PCOS and Insulin Resistance when ttc and took Metformin among other things to ttc. Ive also just started Maternity Leave a week ago from my fulltime high stress job. I also have a lap band so I do not eat very large amounts and am restre=icted with certain types of food.My GTT blood test came back fine as has my other test random blood sugar testing and my urine checks have all been fine also. Im a plus size woman and have just been referred to another doctor that doesnt know me but seems very concerned. She did a random blood sugar test and I got a 4.4 which is pretty normal. She was concerned about my levels when fasting and post meal though so has asked me to test using a Glucometer which I have been doing.The thing is Ive had high readings and even though Im probably eating better now Ive finished work I dont understand why they may be higher? Today for example I had a sleep in so my 1st fasting pre breaky test was 11.0, 2 hrs later after breaky (low gi, minimum sugar etc) it was 10.5. I went out did some shopping etc etc come home ready to prepare a late lunch and tested first getting a reading of 11.6. Ive just had some soup and light cordial so will test again in 2 hrs time.Ive spoken to the dietician to find out how to try and reduce it (minimal carbs, sugar, low gi etc) and will be seeing the diabetes clinic/ dietician again on Monday. I have to continue to monitor it until then when they will access whether I need Insulin treatment or any assistance to bring down my sugar levels.They also will be ultrasounding baby to see his estimated size as he seems to be big which is possibly due to increased insulin apparently?I also had a funny turn Wednesday night and nearly fainted (I was in a singing comp and overdid it i think) so I came home straight away with my dh and rested. My level upon coming home was 13.3Does anyone have this same problem or Know about this? If I try to the best of my knowledge to eat the correct foods etc to help could this make a difference? I used a artificial sweetener pre pregnancy but swapped it for raw sugar when I became pregnant as I heard it wasnt good for u during pregnany. Would it hurt at this late stage to take an artificial sweetner when required instead of sugar (if its only say 1tsp on cereal and a few tsp's in a cuppa or 2 throughout the day?)Thankyou for any insight ladies - im trying to understand this as much as I canI wish that this was not happening and that I could fast forward a few weeks... i just want my lil man here happy and healthy!Lorri\u00a0\u00a0:-)",
