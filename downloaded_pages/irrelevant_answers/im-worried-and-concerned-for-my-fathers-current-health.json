            "answer": "This is going to sound cold, Luccio, but the only real option you have is to save your own life, which you admit is going down the tubes. You have done a great deal for your father and he has done nothing for himself. I know it's sad and hard to watch, but you are banging your head against a brick wall and that hurts! You have hired a caretaker whom he sent away. Your father has emotional problems in addition to his physical ones. You can talk to his doctor and see what he recommends or you can start proceedings to have him declared incompetant and placed in a nursing home where he will receive care. But at your father's age this is not easy to do. But I strongly suggest you not tolerate this behavior, and focus on your own life and wellbeing.",

    "question": "My father is 52 has had a triple bypass 11 years ago, has had diabetes for 17 years and currently suffers from retina detachment caused by his uncontroled diabetes. I'm 23 and have done all I can to help him I'm on the verge of losing my professional job and at risk of letting go of my ambitions because my father cannot control himself with his tantrams, verbal abuse, and anger out bursts. He can no longer see his medicine (7pills and syringes for his insulin) which means he needs a caretaker. He is inconsistent and doesn't stay in one place for too long jumping from my home in los angeles to his home in the Philippines. I've found him a caretaker to give him his medications but he has found away to verbal attack them and send them home. What options do I have? He is at risk of loosing his vision due to his diabetic retinopathy!",
