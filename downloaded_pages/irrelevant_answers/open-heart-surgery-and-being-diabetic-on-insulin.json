Two friends of mine both 77 years old at the time had it done, one with diabetes type 2 - a triple bypass, the other a quintuple - both are doing fine.",

    "question": "My husband is 76 years old.\u00a0\u00a0He had a heart catherization recently and was found to have several blocked arteries.\u00a0\u00a0He had 2 stents put in 2011.\u00a0\u00a0Are the risks too great for my husband at his age with insulin dependent diabetes for 19 years to have open heart surgery?His cardiologist so far has put him a medication regimen to try to help with his blocked arteries.The only sympton he has had with the placing of the stents was Chest Pressure, no other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 The same with his recent heart catherization was chest pressure.\u00a0\u00a0In the ER he was given 2 nitroglycerin, 5 minutes apart, the chest pressure went away after the 2nd nitroglycerin.Does any good specialist in cardiology think that my husband should have the open heart surgery for bypasses considering the risks regarding his age, his diabetes?I would appreciate very explanatory answers, easy to understand, what to do in my husband's situation.Thankyou.",
