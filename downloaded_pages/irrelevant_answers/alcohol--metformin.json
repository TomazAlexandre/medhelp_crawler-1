            "answer": "Hi!You should ideally avoid alcohol completely if you are on metformin. This is because it can precipitate acidosis and increase your blood sugar levels. You can however ask your doctor about taking an occasional drink in moderation. You doctor may allow this depending on your blood sugar profiles and diabetes control. However, as I said, its best to avoid. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
