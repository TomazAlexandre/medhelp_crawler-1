            "answer": "It sounds like she is having seizures - in other words, epilepsy.\u00a0\u00a0Epilepsy in dogs can usually be well-managed with phenobarbital pills.\u00a0\u00a0It can take some time to get the dosage just right, so try to be patient.I know how scary seizures are to the person who is watching.\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing you can do to stop them.\u00a0\u00a0If you can, time the episodes and let your vet know the duration.\u00a0\u00a0Just keep the dog away from anything like furniture that she may bang herself into during the seizure and let it wind down on its own.\u00a0\u00a0Do NOT try to put anything in her mouth.\u00a0\u00a0It is untrue that people and animals who have seizures swallow their tongues, so all you get is a badly bitten hand, and a possible injury to the dog's jaw.\u00a0\u00a0Let her get back on her feet in her own time, and don't force water until she's ready to swallow it on her own.I'm guessing you took her to the vet today?\u00a0\u00a0What did your vet think?",

            "answer": "I have a appointment tomrrow at noon . I filmed her doing it so he could see what she does. I had a dog that had seizures and i dont\u00a0\u00a0think its that. She dont stiffin her whole body its just her neck that tightens and like loosens. As soon as she drinks and eats stuff she is fine she willing stands there and eats and drinks i dont force her to eat it. She is fully alert when this happens. One person suggested diabetes. Cause she ONLY does this when she dont eat. So im getting her tested for that to. Ill post what the vet tells me. Thanks though.",

    "question": "I have NO idea what this is but im taking her to the vet because im about to freak. I have a Little 3 lbs chiuaua and this has happend THREE times but for some reason if she dont eat like tonight i think her belly was hurting because\u00a0\u00a0it was making crazy noises but for whatever reason if she dont eat one night then about 2 to 3 am i get woke up by her moving and moving. When i watch to see what she is doing its almost like she is going to strech like when they wake up and they strech their neck out REAL long but she isnt streching and it tenses up then releases and it seems to be REALLY uncomfortable to her when it happenss. Usally as soon as i make her sugar water (i know there sugar gos low FAST) and put fresh food down and she eats some and drinks that she is fine but tonight here it is 2:30 am and she ate and drank but she continued to do it. So i tried to see if she would eat some donuts since i knew ALOT of sugar was in that:p but she didnt want it. I had sugar mixed in the water she was drinking. But now like 10min later and me geting dressed to take her to the emergancy vet she has stoped. Does ANYONE know what this could be? Please email me at jamie_sheville2000***@**** and let me know or ill keep checking this. Thanks!",
