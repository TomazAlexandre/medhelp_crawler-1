            "answer": "I agree with misscat234, you should visit your doctor! What you are feeling is most likely respiratory infection, and by the greenish mucus I would say it is bacterial, so you will need antibiotics (special ones which will be safe for your child - your doctor will know it). Also the doctor will check how your throat looks and will be able to tell you more.Get well soon!",

            "answer": "I read something more about Sudafed. Sudafed is a trademark for a common brand that contains pseudoephedrine, although Sudafed PE does not contain it. I don\u00b4t know which one you used, but it is recommended that pseudoephedrine is NOT to be used in patients with: diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension, prostatic hypertrophy, hyperthyroidism, closed angle glaucoma, or those who are PREGNANT. When you see your doctor, tell him everything you used (full trademark name of medications). Hope this was helpful.",
