            "answer": "Hi Kim,I also have a lot of the same symptoms except I have an undifferentiated autoimmune disorder, with a positive ANA 1:160 with speckle and dot pattern, a positiveSMA . Prior to all this I was also diagnosed with PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0PCOS contributes to the high cholesterol levels and the way you metabolize carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Has your doc recommended a high complex carb diet, which are whole grains only and also foods that are high in proteitn.\u00a0\u00a0If you stick to this type of diet the chances of you getting diabetes lessens.\u00a0\u00a0I have a strong family history of diabeties with my father and brother were both on Insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I did try metformin for a short time and felt horrible with it.\u00a0\u00a0I never had high blood sugars and my A1C is normal.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped the metformin wih my doctors approval.\u00a0\u00a0I do continue on the Lipitor, because of a family history and my own grossly high level (due to both heredity and PCOS) with my Rhumotologist approval.\u00a0\u00a0This drug may effect the liver in only a slight way.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor has to evaluate the risk of taking it and you developing a cardiac or stroke like symptoms verus liver issues.\u00a0\u00a0You never stated what kind of liver testing was performed.\u00a0\u00a0Are your LFT'S (liver function tests) grossly abnormal?\u00a0\u00a0Did you have a CT scan of your liver?\u00a0\u00a0According to what I have been told (I've been newly diagnosed with a positive SMA and autoimmune)\u00a0\u00a0That until there is positive involement with your liver, (grossly abn LFT's and abn findings on a liver CT) that the chances of progression is slight and could take years or may never occur.\u00a0\u00a0Heart disease and or a stroke can occur sooner if your cholesterol levels continue to climb.\u00a0\u00a0Are both your PCP and Rhum communication with each other and you?\u00a0\u00a0All three of you should be include in your health care choice.\u00a0\u00a0These autoimmune issues are varied and random.\u00a0\u00a0It is a crap shoot to which direction of care to take.\u00a0\u00a0I know it is scary, I also had to make choices in my care. I needed and still need guidence.\u00a0\u00a0You get a lot thrown at you in a small time frame.\u00a0\u00a0I was shocked, scared and confused.\u00a0\u00a0I have a great Rhumy, that guided me, but also gave a choice in the way I would be treated.\u00a0\u00a0She took the time to explain,examine but most of all listen.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find your answers.",

            "answer": "I would have to agree w/ your rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0 I think an autoimmune disorder would certainly need to be investigated before blindly throwing more chemicals in your body.\u00a0\u00a0For example, if you happen to have autoimmune hepatitis, the lipitor would only further damage your liver.I'm not sure if it would help you, but I take (1) enteric coated garlic capsule every day and it brought my cholesterol down to bragging levels.\u00a0\u00a0My sister told me about how it had done the same for her.\u00a0\u00a0It sounded like you were open to a more natural approach.\u00a0\u00a0It would certainly be worth a try.As far as symptoms go, do you have any nausea, fatigue or joint pain?",

    "question": "Hello. I am a post-menopaulal 48 year old female with severe fatigue, fibromyalgia, and Raynaud's. I have slight mitral valve regurgitation also. In addition, I am an Alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency heterozygous carrier (PIMZ). Rheumatoid factor is positive. ESR levels hover between 30 and 55. Positive anti-nuclear antibody, 1:320, speckled pattern. Positive smooth muscle antibody 1:80. My doctor tested for SMA after routine liver tests (I was taking Lipitor) were slightly elevated (in the 40s). When the positive SMA results came back, I then found out about my Alpha-1 anti-trypsin deficiency heterozygous carrier status. My triglycerides have always been fine. My good cholesterol is high, but my bad cholesterol is now higher than normal again and my regular doctor wants me back on Lipitor. I am very hesitant due to the Alpha-1 carrier status and the autoantibodies. Neither parent has heart problems or cancer, but my dad was stricken with autoimmune transverse myelitis in September 2008. My sister has Hashimoto's thyroiditis. I tested negative for that.When I found out about these last positive tests (Alpha-1 and SMA) I decided I had to take better control of my health. I cut out 99% of the sugar and salt in my diet and am eating only fresh fruits and vegetables, frozen no-additives fruits and vegetables, lean beef, pork, chicken, cold water fish, walnuts, almonds, dried fruits, raw honey, fresh herbs, and occasionally, I have whole grain brown rice. I do not eat any gluten, dairy, legumes, or nightshade fruits and vegetables (tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, peppers). I allow myself one or two treats a week like a small amount of dark chocolate or dill pickles.I take 100 mg Savella twice a day for the fibromyalgia. I am not diabetic but I have PCOS so my doctor put me on Metformin, 500 mg twice a day to help prevent diabetes, and spironolactone twice a day for PCOS also.I have a gastroenterologist now due to the abnormal liver tests, positive SMA, and Alpha-1, and he agrees with my primary doctor I should restart the Lipitor and just monitor my liver with frequent blood tests.My rheumatologist, however, tells me he does not think it is wise to restart the Lipitor with all my unspecified autoimmune issues and autoantibodies.I would appreciate your view on this.",
