            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, Vit D deficiency can cause tingling. A generalized tingling sensation can also be due to due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, Vit B12 deficiency, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. Fibromyalgia is another possibility.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
