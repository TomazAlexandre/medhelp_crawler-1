            "answer": "If your doctor thinks your okay and baby is doing well then I would try to not worry. You don't need to gain tons of weight to have a healthy baby and you may not fain the same amount every week. I gained more between some appointments than others but my doctor never said anything about it. I would only worry if your doctor is concerned and notes that you need to gain more or less.",

            "answer": "Your weight gain is fine hun. The main thing is to try to eliminate as much sugar from your diet as possible (no artificial sugars either) and eat lots of protein. You should treat hypoglycemia almost exactly as you would treat diabetes. I know that's not always easy, but high protein & lots of veggies will help regulate your blood sugar. If you get a sweet tooth, eat fruit, not sweets. You'll do great!",
