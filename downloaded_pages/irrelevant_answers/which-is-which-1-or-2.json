    "question": "this is my case. My mother passed on last month on 20th August, am still mourning and regretting this. she was diabetic and was put on tablets which she has taken for almost 20 years. Her mother, my grandmother is also diabetic and gets daily injection for insulin. she has lived with this injection for many years as she was diagnised before my mother and hers was recommended injection. there is also an aunt and uncle who have mild diabetes which is on and off, so i hear.my understanding of diabetes is that type one is the injectable and 2 is the tablet treatment. i thought type one is more risky but mum had a hard time when she developed arthritis which pained her so much. she used to get drips in some of her appointments like 3-4 bottles, she died soon after getting the drip on 20th.now i am more worried. seems this diabetes is genetical. so how can i and my sibling prevent from catching it? which is the most dangerous type? and how long is one supposed to live after contracting the disease?",
