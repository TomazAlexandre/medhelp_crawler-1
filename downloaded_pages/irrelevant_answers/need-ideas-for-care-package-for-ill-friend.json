For the birthday boxes I have sent Mylar balloons that float up as soon as they open the box. Always a great reaction.For Christmas I sent stockings with a tag attached \"Some assembly required\" as I packaged the wrapped items securely for shipping and sending them in the stocking would work as I was afraid of breakage. My MIL thought it was a great idea when she received hers.Have fun and let us know what you come up with.Ren",
