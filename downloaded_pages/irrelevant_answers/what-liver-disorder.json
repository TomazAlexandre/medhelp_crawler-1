Fatty liver is the common cause of elevated SGPT.Refrain from alcohol. Tingling and numbness can be due to nerve compression, nerve damage due to infection or injury, diabetes mellitus, alcohol overuse, vitamin B12 deficiency etc. Urinary tract infection, interstitial cystitis, bladder infection, urinary incontinence, an overactive bladder hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diuretic drugs etc all can lead to a constant feeling to urinate and nocturia.See a physician and get evaluated for determining the exact cause of your symptoms.
