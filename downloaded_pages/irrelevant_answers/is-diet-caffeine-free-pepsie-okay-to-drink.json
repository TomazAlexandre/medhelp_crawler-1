            "answer": "Both Sweetangel and Ziggysgrl are right! My doctor said the same thing..she said artificial sweeteners haven't been proven bad or unsafe for your unborn child...but they haven't been proven to be safe either! But she said she didnt recommend ingesting it not for the babys sake, but for the mommas sake! Anything artificial just isn't good or healthy for you and thats why most doctors suggest sticking with the real thing. However the FDA states it is perfectly safe for women to ingest certain artificial sweeteners during their Pregnancies. So I look at it this way...I don't have a disease, I'm Pregnant! I watch everything I eat and try to eat the most nutritional foods I can for my lil guy...but seriously if I didn't eat ANYTHING that may or may not be \"safe\" I'd be living off of bread and water! And thats certainly not healthy! I'm not saying yea drink diet coke, deli meats and crystal light every day! I'm just saying enjoy your pregnancy, if you crave or want a diet drink every now and then, enjoy it! If you really think about it, we could be eating foods right now that are unsafe for our babies and would never know it...there's just too much to worry about as it is. Think back to the days when everything was \"safe\" to eat. When I saw my mother in law last month, she offered to make me a sandwich and I told her I'm not supposed to eat deli meats unless cooked and she looked at me like I had 3 heads! Shes like really? I know she had children 26 years ago but she said the only thing not safe back then was over easy/runny eggs! haha.So I guess what I'm saying is...just like pre pregnancy...pretty much everything is healthy and okay in moderation. That is the key!! So enjoy yourself!",

            "answer": "Oh yea, I forgot to add-I'm almost halfway through my Pregnancy and every once in a while enjoy a diet soda, crystal light or subway sandwich! And my baby boy is perfectly healthy! I dont smoke, drink or do anything crazy either...so if a diet soda is the worst I can do...please!My best friend had a baby 6 years ago...drank, smoked weed...and didnt follow any of the nutritional guidelines..her baby was and still is perfect! I know it depends on lots of things (the health of your baby) but if we constantly lived by \"what if what if\" we'd all be MAD! Lets just be safe, enjoy our pregnancies and do what makes us feel good and comfortable!",
