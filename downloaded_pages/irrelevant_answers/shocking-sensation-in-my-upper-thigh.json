            "answer": "Tiger,Your symptoms could be a neurological disorder.A pinched lumbar nerve will also cause these symptoms,not the forgetfulness.If you are worried about MS,seek a neurologist.He can advise you.I have the electrical shocks you describe,mine are in my feet and it is and can be painful.I also get the shocking sensation in my neck this is called Lhermites syndrome.Commonly seen in MS and spinal disorders.I have urinary problems and vaginal clear discharge.I'm 40 and have had 2 lumbar surgeries and I have MS.Seek medical advice and find out the cause of your symptoms.With MS,its a new way of life with some limitations,it effects everyone differently.I have fatigue and an afternoon nap helps and the forgetfulness,I write alot of things down.Exercise in moderation helps both.There could be several causes to your symptoms and a trained professional can rule disorders out.A diagnosis to MS is a long road,several disorders must be ruled out first.Hang in there.",

            "answer": "Hey, I agree with youngatheart.\u00a0\u00a0But I would see a neurologist to rule out MS....soemtimes this takes a while.\u00a0\u00a0I had the electrical sensations in the very same place you describe and I found out a few weeks ago, that I have epilepsy - not grand mal seizures, but partial seizures.\u00a0\u00a0My MRI had a very small lesion and my EEG's glowed like crazy with activity.\u00a0\u00a0I have an Aunt and cousin with MS, so of course, this was a concern to me.\u00a0\u00a0But all tests ruled that out.\u00a0\u00a0All I can say is just don't stop looking - you know that this is not normal - could just be a pinced nerve - but only you know your body the best.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you,Charley",

    "question": "I am a 33 yrs old woman.\u00a0\u00a0About 3 mo ago I started getting a shocking or burning sensation in my upper thigh, relatively close to where my tight meets my pelvis.\u00a0\u00a0I can only decribe it as intense as a charly horse, yet its not a cramping, its a burning; it will last approx 30 seconds, then subside.\u00a0\u00a0I can go a week or two with out an incident then one day I can have in the upwards of 50 of these episodes.\u00a0\u00a0I quit my excersize regiment because I was initially afraid that it was a torn muscle.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for blood clots as the sensation is located directly where my main artery runs down my leg.\u00a0\u00a0It was negative for clotting.I have been having other wierd things lately which may or may not be related; somewhat of an incontinence problem and a substantial amount of increased clear vaginal discharge that I cannot explain.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been extremely fatigued and somewhat forgetful.I was testing in April before any of these symptoms showed up for thyroid, diabetes, all blood work was normal.My husband has me worried that these could be beginning symptoms of MS.",
