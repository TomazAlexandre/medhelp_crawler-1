    "question": "Hi everyone,I found out on Saturday that i was pregnant. If you remember my last post of early July - i told you that i was off ttcing cause the 3 rounds of clomid hadnt worked and i am a PCOS sufferer and a bit over weight - so we need to chill so that i can loose weight first and then try again later. MLP was on 12th July, AF was expected on 8th August, did the hormone test on 1st August (21st day) and my Progesterone was 6.06 which my Dr. said that it was a good indication that i could have ovulated, though he said he would have been happier with a double digit eg 10. I tested at around 11th August which was about CD31 and the test was BFN - so i embarked on my weight loss - step earobics x 5 days a week and last week i started a GNLD weight loss programme called GR2 Control - these tablets are supposed to supress one's appetite, make you feel full and work on controlling how your body burns fats and carbohidrates - for some reason - i still felt hungry and exhausted and yet all success stories say you feel energetic and dont feel hungry at all - i didnt like the test of the meal replacement either. I was very sleepy for the last 3 days of last week and was wondering what the problem was - my joints too were hurting - so i suspected Malaria (being in Africa).Saturday morning - i went to the Dr's for a malaria check and i requested the Dr. to do a pregnancy test just in case and guess what it was a BFP - on my way home still i bought a test strip and went home and tested and i saw the two lines!\u00a0\u00a0Boy was i excited or what? DH want us to go do a scan, etc - was telling him to slow down. I will be seing my Dr. this evening - am worried about my progesterone and offcourse later alone Gestetional Diabetes and high blood pressure - i would like to continue with my earobics class and metamorfin - will see what the Dr. says tonite.What did i do differently this cycle - exercise, EPO, Vitamin E, Magnisium, No alcahol, relaxed!All the best to those who got BFPs - i have been reading and offcourse the ones who are still ttc - dont loose hope - it will come!",
