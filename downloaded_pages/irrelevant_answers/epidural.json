            "answer": "Hi Grampy,You are correct that steroid epidurals can elevate blood sugar levels for diabetics which in turn can cause additional problems when you have heart failure. Do you have CHF?If the treatments are not doing you any good it makes no sense to struggle with the side effects of the injections. For the diabetics that these injections do work for it may be worth the challenging side effects. Usually they can be managed.Thank you for posting your opinion. How do you manage your pain?Peace,~Tuck",

    "question": "I also refused epidural. And that was another reason for kicking me out of clinic. The epidurals do not work,they just up my sugar and I do not think they are good for my heart failure.",
