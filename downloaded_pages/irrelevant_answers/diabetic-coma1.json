            "answer": "Hello,As you may know, none of us here is a physician.\u00a0\u00a0We are also not lawyers, and laws vary by state and country so it would be best to check in with a lawyer in your area for legal guidance.\u00a0\u00a0The best I can offer are suggestions based on my very limited experience.Hospitals (but I'm not sure about burn centers) usually have an office/individual called an \"ombudsman\" whose role it is to help investigate complaints and to help achieve an equitable outcome.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the burn center has an ombudsman; if so, you can report your complaint to that person and expect that person to follow up.From the little information you provided, it sounds as tho' your hubby is in rather serious condition ... If I understand right, he has both severe burns and is also in a coma?\u00a0\u00a0This must be a very difficult time for you.If you are not satisfied with the quality of his medical care, ask for a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0For example, if you believe that his burns are being treated properly but that his diabetes is not, then ask his endocrinologist for guidance.",
