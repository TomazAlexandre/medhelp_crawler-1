            "answer": "Hello,The lack of sensation during ejaculation can be due to compression of the nerve or some entrapment of the nerve. Stop jelqing and avoid masturbation for some days and eat a healthy diet and some vitamin B 12 supplements. If the symptoms persist then the possibilities of diabetes, thyroid disorders, prostate infections and neurological causes needs to be investigated, You need to get your blood sugar levels, thyroid function tests and prostate examination done from a urologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
