            "answer": "There are very good pediatric endos out there just like there are great adult endos - the key is to find one who treats thyroid disorders.\u00a0\u00a0I have a pediatric endo who only deals with diabetes (for my son)\u00a0\u00a0- my regular endo deals with thyroids only and he has treated me and my daughter (since she was 16).\u00a0\u00a0Call and ask - thyroid disorders are a bit of a speciality.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a children's hospital near you that you could call and ask?",

    "question": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0My 6-year-old daughter was just diagnosed with Hashimotos.\u00a0\u00a0We took her in for an enlarged thyroid (we could see it in her school picture).\u00a0\u00a0I don't have a copy of her lab results.\u00a0\u00a0The pediatrician told me that her TSH was high, her T4 and T3 were normal and she tested positive for antithyroglobin antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0He put her on levothyroxine after consulting with a ped endo, but said he could continue treating her.\u00a0\u00a0My 1st question is..should I take her to a ped endo?\u00a0\u00a0My 2nd question is regarding other symptoms...she has also been having night sweats (a few times in the last few weeks that I know of) and has a slightly enlarged (marble-size) lymph node in the back of her neck that we discovered after the dr appt.\u00a0\u00a0She is also pale with dark cirlces under her eyes and tired.\u00a0\u00a0Are these all normal symptoms of Hasimoto's?",
