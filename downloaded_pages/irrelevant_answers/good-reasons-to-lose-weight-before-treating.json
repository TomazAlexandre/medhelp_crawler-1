    "question": "Seeing Kathy73 post about being SVR reminded me about the importance of losing weight before TX. If I recall she was very sensitive about being overweight. It is great she was still able to achieve SVR.Here are some studies why losing weight before treatment is important, not to mention other health issues from being overweight.Obese patients who are treated for chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection are more likely to have a better outcome if the underlying abnormalities caused by excessive fat tissue are corrected first, according to a review published in the medical journal Hepatology.The lead author, Dr. Michael R. Charlton of the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota, and colleagues point out that obesity is considered to be a metabolic condition, not simply a matter of being very overweight.Obesity in patients with HCV infection is associated inflammation and insulin resistance, a \"prediabetic\" abnormality of blood sugar. These patients may also have steatosis, \"fatty liver disease;\" progression of fibrosis, scarring of the liver; and poor response to interferon and ribavirin, the standard treatment for HCV infection.Patients with hepatitis C and obesity-related fatty liver disease are also at greater risk for more advanced liver disease.Weight loss to reduce fat tissue is an important first step in improving response to treatment, the investigators advise. Also important is treatment with diabetes drugs, such as metformin and pioglitazone, to improve insulin sensitivity and reduce fat accumulation in the liver. This might reverse disease progression, the researchers note.Other approaches to enhance patients' response to combination drug therapy may include longer duration of treatment and higher doses to counteract the decreased response to the drugs. Rather than basing doses on weight, they suggest, drug doses could be based on body mass index, a ratio of height to weight.\"Treatment strategies that focus on improving underlying metabolic factors associated with poor response to combination therapy,\" conclude the researchers, are \"more likely to overcome the low sustained viral response rates observed in obese patients infected with HCV.\"____________________________________________________________________________________________According to the results of the research, type 2 diabetes (DM), obesity and hypertension (HTN) are associated with overall and liver related mortality in hepatitis C (HCV) infected patients. In HCV-infected patients, the top three predictors of liver related mortality were having higher body mass index (BMI), presence of insulin resistance (IR) and elevated serum cholesterol. Overall mortality in HCV patients was most linked to metabolic syndrome, higher BMI and hypertension.Metabolic syndrome is a combination of medical problems that increase risks of cardiovascular disease and diabetes. It affects one in five people, and prevalence increases with age. Recent data have suggested that metabolic syndrome is associated with adverse outcomes in HCV patients. This study set out to assess which aspects of metabolic syndrome are of most risk to such HCV patients and to quantify their specific impact on mortality.Professor Zobair Younossi MD, MPH from the Center for Liver Diseases at Inova Fairfax Hospital and the Executive Director of Betty and Guy Beatty's Center for Integrated Research, Virginia, USA, who led the study, said: \"Exploring the risk factors associated with adverse outcomes in HCV patients helps us to better understand the complex nature of this highly prevalent disease. This study shows a clear association between key components of metabolic syndrome and mortality in HCV patients and demonstrates the importance of lifestyle improvements and coaching in the management of HCV patients, to potentially minimise the onset and impact of metabolic syndrome and its associated mortality risks.\"",
