            "answer": "Hello,Any type of tingling sensations in the extremities (hands and feet) is called parasthesia. They are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
