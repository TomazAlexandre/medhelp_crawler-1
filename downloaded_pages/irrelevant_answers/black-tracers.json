            "answer": "Any number of things depending on what's going on. If it happens by itself it would make sense to see an opthalomologist. If you have other physical concerns a neurologist. And if there are other psychiatric issues a psychiatrist. But you'd have to be more specific as to what other concerns you have or if it happens by itself.",

            "answer": "Yeah your very vague but to begin with go see an eye doc, get your vision checked out, floaters can be a sign of an underlining medical condtion like high blood pressure, diabetes and they do look like a black cobweb floating around in your vision, each floater though is normally only seen in one eye at a time, so if your seeing black shapes in your vision and your seeing it with both eyes then it may not be floaters.\u00a0\u00a0In that case go see ur GP.",
