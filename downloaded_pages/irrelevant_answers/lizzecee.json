            "answer": "Hi bip -the medical name for excessive urination is polyurea -\u00a0\u00a0one internet site lists 94 possible causes!! Looks like searching for the proverbial needle in a haystack I am afraid. Some of the more common causes can be:urinary tract infectionsbladder condition eg intestitial cystitisdiabetesSorry, don't know much about it except that when my mother was dx with late onset diabetes 2 her symptoms were excessive thirst (especially for fizzy drinks) and excessive urination. Her dx was easily sorted out by urine and blood tests, but since you have had these done, diabetes seems to be ruled out.You might try googling \"excessive urination\" or \"polyurea\"\u00a0\u00a0and see what you come up with. I would guess it is back to the doctor.Gosh, you are lucky you don't go during the night! I get up at least twice, if not 3 times, which does disturb my sleep.Take care,Liz.",
