            "answer": "They put an iv in your arm that drips pitocin. The pitocin gives you contractions. I was induced and it wasnt to bad pretty boring for awhile lol i was induced at 8 am and finally started having contractions every 2 min. and less around 5 pm. They check to see if youve dilated probably about every 1 to 2 hrs. With me i was only 2 cm. dilated when i first got there and afterva few hours wasnt dilating hardly at all. So they put some kind of balloon thing in my cervix and pulled on it once every 45 min. or so and by the time it came out i was about 4 cm. It didnt hurt at all. Everyone is different though. I didnt have my son until 2:15 am. So it may go alot faster for you. My advice is tho if you are planning having an epidural when the contractions start getting really hard dont hesitate get that epidural!!! I wanted so badly to have a natural birth but the pitocin makes the contractions extremely rock hard and it really hurts!! I waited until my contractions were less than a minute a part it was horrible!!! But other than that it was a good experience for me :) you will be fine dont be scared, once you get there and they start everything i feel like your more excited than anything a little nervous but excited :) Goodluck!!!!!",
