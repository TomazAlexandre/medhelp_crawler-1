Fibro, degenerative arthritis, and diabetes. If a friend doesn't recognize your pain and support you, she (or he) is NOT a friend. Stay bundled up and war! It helps. I can tell you a day in advance when it's going to rain! Good luck, and God Bless.",

            "answer": "I can tell DAYS (up to five) in advance when it's going to rain, I have arthritis in every joint that moves, neck, wrists, elbows, shoulders, hips and knees and let's not forget my flippin ankles. I'm a walking, talking weather machine. I just turn to the weather page to find out how long I'm going to be miserable and suffer from the pain. People now ask me if we're going to have rain any time soon. I used to take VIOXX before the recall but now I can't take it even though it's back on the market, EKG tracing ruled that out.Tonight I'm sitting here with a knee injected with SUPARTZ and a screaming meemie migraine starting. Time to get off the internet and relax this neck of mine.",

    "question": "http://www6.lexisnexis.com/publisher/EndUser?Action=UserDisplayFullDocument&orgId;=2499&topicId;=100015118&docId;=l:615922493That is a link that I wanted to give you to read about this LYME DISEASE controversy. I found this when I decided to go over to the \"arthritis foundation\" homepage so that I could send a friend some information re: arthritis. She and I got into an almost heated discussion regarding winter weather and arthritis. She said that it was ridiculous that I can stay active in warmer weather and lose a considerable amount of weight (40-50 lbs, during spring/summer months) and then in the winter months be less active. It's because I have considerable arthritis in my joints, osteoarthritis and it becomes quite painful in cold, wet winter months. When the barometric pressure falls, arthritis is at it's worst. I can get up and move around but not without terrific pain in the joints. There are days that I just yearn to stay in bed in my warm comfort than expose myself to pain and cold. I almost became insensed with her remark of \"ridiculous\" and asked her if she didn't know or understand arthritis, so now I'm going to enlighten her so that we don't have to come to blows on this topic. I don't choose to have arthritis, but I do and I have to live with it and the constant pain that it causes when it's cold and wet outside. GRRRRRRRRR I get almost angry when people think so shallow of another's pain!",
