            "answer": "Hello!These vibrations in the vagina could possibly be due to fasiculations of the pelvic floor muscles. These usually occur when the nerve carrying sensation from that area is pinched or affected in any way. Infection of the nerve can also cause this sensation. These nerves originate from nerve fibers from the lower spinal cord. Conditions like spinal cord herniation or degeneration of the spinal bones can cause these symptoms. Diabetes mellitus, vitamin B deficiencies, neuropathy can also cause these symptoms. Do seek medical help.Best wishes!",
