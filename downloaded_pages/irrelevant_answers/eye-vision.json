I went back to the eye doctor and they diagnosed it as a condition called keratoconus (would fall in the corneal disease category mentioned by the MD above me).\u00a0\u00a0I don't say this to worry you because that was my unique circumstance, but it could be a number of things so you should go back and get it checked out. In my case they prescribed a new contact lens that allowed more oxygen to get to my eye.\u00a0\u00a0Most likely the doctor will have an explanation for you!",
