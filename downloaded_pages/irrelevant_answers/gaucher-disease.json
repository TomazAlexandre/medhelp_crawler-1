            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Constipation is not a normal feature of Gaucher\u2019s disease. However chronic liver involvement and improper diet can precipitate it.Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber and also due to dehydration. Diabetes and hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc can all cause constipation.A proper investigation is required preferably by a gastroenterologist (a doctor who looks after the digestive system) to know what is the cause. The treatment will follow correct diagnosis.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Constipation is indeed unlikely associated with Gaucher's disease.\u00a0\u00a0This condition can respond to increased fluid intake and fiber-rich diet.\u00a0\u00a0If this persists, further evaluation may need to be done. A referral to a gastroenterologist may indeed be helpful. Take care and do keep us posted.",
