            "answer": "See a urogynecologist. Get them to do bladder testing to get a definitive diagnosis to explain your symptoms. Depending on the resulte of the bladder testing, there may be a cure for your specific problem. Because you had the surgery to ablate some of your pelvic nerves, it is difficult to speculate without some hard data about your bladder function. This data would come from the bladder testing.Dr. Hoyte",

            "answer": "Dear Dr. Hoyte,I've had frequent urination for the past few years (approx 15-20 times/day).\u00a0\u00a0No pain when I urinate. I always wake up twice or sometimes even more\u00a0\u00a0at night to go to the bathroom. I don't drink alcohol or caffeine. It seems like the frequency is worse before and during my period.A cystoscopy was performed and the result was normal, but the doctor still prescribed me Elmiron, which isn't really helping. His next plan is to inject botox into my bladder...... which I'd like to avoid. I also had transvaginal and abdominal ultrasounds, which were also normal too.\u00a0\u00a0I do have lower back pain before and on the first day of my period. I don't know what I should do next. I am 30 and have no experience of childbirth. I would appreciate it if you could give me some advice.Thank you",

            "answer": "I have not had testing recently but I am in a similar boat. I have to go to the bathroom about 6 times before I go to bed and I cannot relieve my bladder completely....( I almost think it is in my head) But I have noticed it is much worse right before my period. And I get up at least two times during the night.I have in the past had ultrasounds and done hormone therapy( progesterone)... which that month my bladder control was much worse and my DR thought I had a UT. I have been tested for diabetes too. I thought it may have something to do with too low estrogen or too much, and wonder if that is possible?I also have been told I have symptoms of endometreosis( spotting several days before a heavy flow), which I most likely have to live with....hmmmm It is during this time I go the bathroom all the time...or could anyway!I would love to know Dr. Hoyte's feelings on this type of expierence.",

    "question": "Before my surgery last year in June I always had an overactive bladder.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to have gotten worse since my surgery I was diagnosed with Stage IV endo they did a bladder resection and severed the nerves in my pelvis which i heard can cause this problem.\u00a0\u00a0Even when i think that I am done it still comes pooring out.\u00a0\u00a0After my surgery I had to get a cathader put in because i couldnt Pee the same thing happened after the birth of my daughter 5 yrs ago. This time they almost wouldnt let me leave because my bladder wasnt completely emptying and with a lot a persuasian i was released. Is there something wrong?\u00a0\u00a0Wouldnt they have seen something wrong with my bladder during the surgery?\u00a0\u00a0I mean this is crazy when i lie down to go to bed i have to pee 4 times before i finally am able to fall asleep.\u00a0\u00a0This is within a half hour time frame.\u00a0\u00a0When i feel cold i have to pee right away.\u00a0\u00a0I dont have any infections and was tested many times for that.\u00a0\u00a0What do you think could be the problem?",
