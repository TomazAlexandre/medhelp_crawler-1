            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes. My diabetes educator wants me to have another glucose challenge test after I have the baby to make sure the diabetes has resolved. I do have a family history of relatives (grandparents, one aunt) who developed Type II diabetes later in life (the earliest was around age 60) so I am at higher risk of developing it myself.As to staying on the diet I am on now...are you crazy? LOL I am limited to a maximum of 3 carb choices (that is 45g of carbohydrate) per meal (some people are allowed to go up to 4 but my meal plan is limited to 3) and 1 carb choice for snacks. Do you have any idea how limiting that is?I am also not able to eat ANY bread or cereal because my body has a hard time processing it. I can eat 20g of carb in the form of a whole grain cereal and my blood sugar after looks as though I ate 60g of another type of carb. I've even tried high protein whole grain cereals...same thing happens.I love oatmeal and whole wheat bread...I haven't been able to eat either since I developed GDM...after baby is born, I am SO buying a box of my favorite cereal and some oatmeal! Wheat bread too!!",

            "answer": "I would discuss this with your Dr., but for most women, things return to normal after giving birth.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with sticking to a healthy diet though as you are at a higher risk now.\u00a0\u00a0Just take care of yourself, and ensure you are getting regular checkups (we all should do that anyway).",
