            "answer": "I'm not sure about your pain, although with Stage 2 you shouldn't have any as Stage 2 CKD is pretty tolerable. Then again, you may have a VERY LOW pain threshold and it truly is a symptom of the CKD.I have Stage 2 myself, although mine is asymptomatic (no visible symptoms). Only reason I even know is because I do a yearly renal-function test due to having PKD & Cystinuria (I have a ton of cysts on my left side as well as making a ton of kidney-stones... again, all on my left side).I seriously doubt your early kidney-stone episode & subsequent ESWL have anything to do with your CKD. Unfortunately, so people just develop kidney disease and have to deal with the hand their deal.Do you have diabetes? Do you have hypertension (high blood pressure)? What is your creatinine level (if they did a blood test, it should be a marker in there)? Just how 'shrunken' (small) is your kidney? Is this on one side or is it bilateral?LMNO",

            "answer": "Thanks for you response.No, I don't have diabetes, hypertension.My left kidney is about 9 cm, right is about 11 cm.I dont have the reports with me at present , but I was told that all the biochemical parameters including creatinine were normal.I wanted to ask what are the problems that I may face further and how to avoid them.What kind of follow up are you following, i.e what investigations at how much interval?Once again Thanks a lot.",

            "answer": "Stage-2 is early stage renal failure, so your urologist just needs to get you in about one every 6 months or so to do a renal-function test. As long as he keeps his eye on it, you should be fine. There's no really CURE for CKD. It's one of those things that just sort of 'happens'... kind of like cancer. There's really no harm in having mildly reduced kidney function, but try staying away from caffeine and alcohol as much as possible, and if you partake in the odd glass of wine here and there, make sure you wash it down (dilute it) with plenty of water. I've actually quit drinking alcohol of any type permanently. I know it *****, but that's the hand we've been dealt my friend.",
