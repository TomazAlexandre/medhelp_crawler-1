            "answer": "Dear Stephie:Sorry your still having problems.\u00a0\u00a0No, this does not sound like MS or ALS.\u00a0\u00a0Your neurological exam was normal as well as all the neuroimaging and lab testing.\u00a0\u00a0No, it does not sound like an atypical migraine as your still having fasciculations.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt this is from your birth control switch.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms you describe could be from a viral infection, something akin to post viral syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0What you describe sounds very much like benign fasciculations.\u00a0\u00a0This is where one has muscle fasciculations that come and go, often for no apparent reason.\u00a0\u00a0They can have some sensory symptoms such as pins and needles but usually they are not present.\u00a0\u00a0They do no harm to the muscle or nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0They are made worse by anxiety, fatigue, and illness.\u00a0\u00a0The time course is very individual, I have seen patients having these for many years on a sporatic course.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "I posted a question about a month about some problems I was having.\u00a0\u00a0I'll start over.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a relatively healthy 21 year old female.\u00a0\u00a0About a month and a half ago, I had a really bad headache that was in my right temple.\u00a0\u00a0At the time of the headache, I started getting pins and needles feeling in the right side of my face.\u00a0\u00a0Went to see my doctor, and she said it was just tension headaches, but sent me for bloodwork.\u00a0\u00a0Was checked for diabetes, thyroid, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0Within 2 days the tingling spread to my arms and hands, and my legs and feet.\u00a0\u00a0The headache went away.\u00a0\u00a0I was getting this pins and needles feeling all over my body.\u00a0\u00a0Not a constant thing, just a sporadic tingling that lasted for a few minutes at a time.\u00a0\u00a0I was also getting sporadic muscle twitches all over my body.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor thought that it may have been a viral infection.\u00a0\u00a0I was sent for an MRI that was also normal.\u00a0\u00a0I took your advice on getting a neurological exam.\u00a0\u00a0Went for the exam, that was also normal.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist thought that it may have been manifestation of migraine.\u00a0\u00a0I've never heard of that.\u00a0\u00a0He also thought it may have been a side effect from the birth control I was on.\u00a0\u00a0I had been taking ortho tricyclene for about 2 1/2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I developed cysts on my ovaries and my doctor changed by birth control to Alesse.\u00a0\u00a0I took the Alesse for about 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0It made my cycle irregular, so I was put back on the ortho tricyclene.\u00a0\u00a0At the time of the symptoms I had already been back on the ortho tricyclene for about a month.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms have started to get better, but I'm still a little concerned that it may be something serious like MS or ALS.\u00a0\u00a0My questions for you are:1.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that it was manifestation of migraine even if I wasn't having headaches anymore but also still having tingling sensations?2.\u00a0\u00a0Could it have been from the birth control switch?3.\u00a0\u00a0Does it sound MS or ALS related?4.\u00a0\u00a0Viral infection?5.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any idea of what else it may be?6.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything else I should do?\u00a0\u00a0See another doc?Any help would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0This is a great site!!!",
