            "answer": "I dont think you can qualify AIDs as an autoimmune disease (it is instead an immuno disease that attacks the immune system). An autoimmune disease is such that antibodies produced by the body attack the body's tissue. Many many people have autoimmune diseases differing in severity. Most have mild cases and do not require active health management. Examples are thyroid problems, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, autoimmune hepatitis, etc.....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 You should probably have a sit down with this guy and have a hearth to hearth talk about his health. If it turns out that you misunderstood or there was miscommunication and he infact has HIV/Aids you can educate yourself on the disease i.e. how its transmitted, care, treatment and should you want to maintain a relationship with this chap then maybe a chat with a doctor (maybe both of you together chat with his doctor or another doctor that specializes in his disorder) is in order so you are both fully aware of what the issues are and how you can protect yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi, I met this boy one evening and later kissed him (open mouth kiss), he was acting very odd and called me the next day to tell me he had an Auto Immune Disease...immediatley I assumed AIDS, and then he swore up and down that he didn't have aids but an auto immune disease that he was born with that made him succeptable to sickness and he wanted to make sure the cut on my lip wasnt a cold sore (which it was, almost gone).....I started to freak out immediatley and to this day can't seem to get the feeling that he had AIDS and I contracted it thru kissing him 1 evening.Has anyone ever heard of Auto Immune Diseases that aren't AIDS, I am so confused.....I was tested for HIV almost 2 yrs after the incident and it came back negative, however I am a worry wart and can't seem to stop thinking everytime I dont feel well its related to that....I have had numerious blood tests over\u00a0\u00a0the past year for an unrelated issue and nothing has came up (would the doctors be able to detect this?) Can you even get HIV/AIDS from kissing....If someone could please help, I am sick of freaking out all the time over every little sickness I get...for example, I have been tired/dizzy for the past 2 wks and doctors say it could be allergies but I'm just not convinced...Please help!",
