            "answer": "Hello,there are some drug that may help, although they do have side effect. You will have to ask your doctor about this.Neuropathy is a result of consistent high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to actually resolve / cure it is to get your blood sugars very tightly controlled with most if not all reading in the range of 80-140.\u00a0\u00a0IF you can control your blood sugar this well, it is possible that you may be able to recover the neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Note that the healing process takes a long time (about 6 - 8 months) and the pain may temporarily be worse (healing nerves hurt) before it finally improves.I could recommend you look up Bernstein Diabetes University on U-tube and watch some of his videos.\u00a0\u00a0They talk about how to control blood sugar very well.\u00a0\u00a0You will need a combination of insulin, strict attention to low carb diet, exercise, and maybe additional medications.",

            "answer": "Thank you Sally.Until I take prednisone (for another health condition) my blood sugar is typically in the 87 to 95 range.However, when I take prednisone my sugar reading is between 120 and 140 -- UNTIL the I stop taking the medication.I take prednisone (as needed) to battle swellings (idiopathic angioedema). In fact, it was prednisone (taken as needed over the last 6 years) which gave me the diabetes in the first place.I am not on medication for diabetes, because -- EXCEPT when I am on prednisone, I am keeping my blood sugar in a good range (87-95).Does anyone know of a substitute for prednisone, which resolves swelling?",
