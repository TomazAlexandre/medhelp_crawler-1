            "answer": "Dear Jerry,Again i'm no doctor but when i do get a blood test done i also do a reading on my meter and though they may be off it isn't 10% to 20%. And when i compare my note with my endocrinologist, she says that is well within the lab specs for a test. But i'm usually high in my meter test. Hope other may shed more light on this. Being a little off is within the parameters of lab type tests. bret",

And 300 isn't much different from 345 (we likely feel lousy).\u00a0\u00a0However, 70 might feel quite different from 60, so if I'm feeling low and my meter says 70, I treat it like a low and get on with my life.",
