            "answer": "Hi Naresh ,Ejection fraction (Ef) is the fraction of blood pumped out of a ventricle with each heart beat. Normally if not specified , Ef\u00a0\u00a0refers to that of left ventricle . If Ef of left and right ventricles are taken they are specified as LVEF and RVEF .Healthy individuals\u00a0\u00a0have ejection fractions between 50% and 65%. However, normal values depend upon the modality being used to calculate the ejection fraction. Damage to the muscle of the heart (myocardium), eg. during myocardial infarction or cardiomyopathy, impairs the heart's ability to eject blood and therefore reduces ejection fraction. This reduction in the ejection fraction can lead to heart failure . Your aunt has a borderline Ef of 64 % . so no need to worry much . Please give her good diet including lots of protein , multivitamins , multiminerals and Omega 3 . She should take lots of fruits and vegetables . exercises like swimming , cycling , walking help to condition the heart muscles . Please consult a cardiologist for further management plan . Hope this helps you . Take care and regards !",

            "answer": "Hi,Since your aunt is a diabetic , the fruits that she can take are sweet lime , apples , raisins , papaya and guava . She should avoid banana , mango and grapes . She must take natural supplements of multiminerals and multivitamins if the consumption of fruits is raising her blood sugar significantly . The supplements have only nutrients and no sugar so they are a better substitute . If her sugar levels are near normal , she can try to take fruits and check her sugar levels regularly .",
