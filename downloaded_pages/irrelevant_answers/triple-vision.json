            "answer": "Often this is due to damage to the cranial nerves, specifically the 3rd and 4th. There are many possible causes, including high blood pressure, diabetes, vitamin B-12 intake etc. It is important for your mother to see an M.D. opthamologist as soon as possible. Often the nerves can re-generate with treatment. If the situation goes on long enough the damage can become permanent. The \"extra pounds\" comment suggest a diabetic etiology. This is a disconcerting problem and also often causes a person to lose their sense of balance. You mom needs professional medical advice and a thorough workup from an M.D. DON'T LET THIS GO!",
