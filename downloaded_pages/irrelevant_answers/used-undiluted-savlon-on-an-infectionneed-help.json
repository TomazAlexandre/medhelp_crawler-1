            "answer": "Hello,First of all regular change of the dressings preferably from a healthcare provider is necessary if the wound is an open wound. The aim is to keep the dressing dry and clean. Doctor may prescribe topical antibiotics for the wound after culture sensitivity of the wound discharge or wound swabs. You will also need to take an oral course of antibiotics to combat the infection and prevent it from reoccurring.Please take a nutritious diet and consult a doctor for specific topical and oral antibiotics. Also get your blood sugar levels checked as diabetes causes delayed wound healing.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
