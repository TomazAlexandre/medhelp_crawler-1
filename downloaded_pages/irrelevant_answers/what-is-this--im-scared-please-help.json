            "answer": "Seeing the doctor was the best action, happy you took that step. That said, wonder why he didn't do the EKG .. my primary care does.\u00a0\u00a0Suppose it varies - it appears the doctor may have recommended you see a specialist, a cardiologist, for the EKG.\u00a0\u00a0It would be a good move, especially if your symptoms persist.I take it this is the first outbreak of they symptoms you have, and assume you doctor discussed if anything in your life has elevated your emotional state, prior to the physical upset.\u00a0\u00a0Stress can cause all kinds of symptoms.I'd take a low dose aspirin every day, well I in fact do.\u00a0\u00a0That only if aspirin doesn't upset your stomach.\u00a0\u00a0It may not help with the symptoms but is believed to provide some heart help or protection.\u00a0\u00a0That's why I take aspirin and my doctor is okay with that... both my primary care and my cardiologist. Yep, I'm an old guy with a long heart history, but never a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise and weight management and stopping smoking 30 years ago have all helped me.",

            "answer": "Sorry for the very late response. I did EKG, and the result is normal. He advised me to go to endocrinologist prior to my pre-diabetes. It has something to do with the muscles. He told me that I should avoid stress here at work. But its unavoidable. :D",

    "question": "28 year old female here. I'm scared because I have the so called \"heart attack symptoms\" like left upper chest pain, left back pain, occasional left neck pain and jaw pain especially when cold, shortness of breath when talking or walking unlike before , and I feel that I have so much phlegm in my chest that's why i'm having difficult breathing. When I went to the doctor, he just advise me to do ECG. I have normal blood pressure, normal oxygen level, normal heart beat. And he just prescribe tizanidine 2 mg once a day. Thank you.",
