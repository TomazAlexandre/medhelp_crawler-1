            "answer": "Was your gastroparesis diagnosed by a gastroenterologist? This test envolves swallowing multiple pellets/pills at specific times that plot the path and time-line of G.I. motility with X-Rays. Reglan is often prescribed for gastroparesis. Reglan can cause a variety of neurological symptoms. What meds are you taking? Did they rule out a hiatal hernia (MRI of chest and belly)? Gastroparesis is usually diagnosed with diabetes. Was diabetes ruled-out by a hemoglobin A1c? This test is Only an AVERAGE. Your sugar can be running High and low, but AVERAGE \"normal\". And, there are False-Negatives if you are also anemic. The hemoglobin A1c only checks the sugar based on the last 3 months of your red blood cells' life. If your are turning over red blood cells faster (anemia), then this test can be inaccurate. The Oral Glucose Tolerance Test is the \"Gold-Standard\". Check out the Joslin website for diabetes... Buy a glucometer...Stomach pains can be from an A.A.A. (abdominal aorta aneurysm), mesenteric insufficiency, internal hernias, C. dificile, diverticulitis, internal parasites (worms), chronic prostatitis, etc... Liver enzymes can be elevated from Tylenol, other Over-The-Counter medicines, spoiled peanuts, Tagmet (OTC heart-burn medicine), or simply too many medicines being metabolized by the liver....If you play alot of tennis, your muscle tightness could be from a cramp or electrolyte imbalance. Check electolyte and mineral imbalances..... ANTIPSYCHOTIC\u00a0\u00a0(Abilify) medications can have varied and idiosyncratic reactions....Some reactions Do NOT disappear After the medication is STOPPED !!!! BEWARE !!!!\u00a0\u00a0Get a copy of blood tests. My mother-in-law and mother both had a kidney infection with back pain for weeks. Their doctors tested their urine....The doctors NEVER told them they had a kidney infection...Only AFTER records were requested, was the kidney infection found and finally treated (leukocytosis, leukocytesterase, WBC, bacteria positive)....GET A COPY OF YOUR RECORDS....P.S. My cat had elevated liver enzymes 40x normal, glowed yellow with jaundice...from an environmental toxin (rat poison likely). I refused antibiotics for a non-existent infection (CBC normal). Put him under full-spectrum lizard light-bulbs, gave him milk thistle (in oil, Not alcohol), and he recovered....Bilirubin is \"broken down\" by full-spectrum lights.\u00a0\u00a0Milk thistle has saved many lives from certain death by poison mushrooms....Hope I have shed some light and stimulated more questions. God bless, dj.",

    "question": "I was perfectly healthy until this past summer when I began to have stomach pains and regurgitating after meals. The pain in my stomach eventually got to the point where I decided to take the semester off from college to figure things out. This January I was diagnosed with Gastroparesis. In the Fall, the stomach pain effected my sleep and I got overtired. This led to me getting scared and confused about irrational things. I was taken to a hospital and put on a psychotropic drug called Abilify. I was on the drug for 4 months and then tapered off of it under doctors direction. I've been off of it now for almost two months. I was on only a low dose for the final 2 months (5 mg)Unfortunately I'm still having symptoms of muscle ridgidity and lightheadedness, which I first remember having while on the drug. I sometimes feel like I'm about to faint when going from sitting to standing. There's also tension in my left leg that causes me to wiggle the toes on my left foot.\u00a0\u00a0I've been to a neurologist who has referred me to a movement disorders specialist. The blood work I've done has ruled out Wilson's disease, Hepatitis, Diabetes, and thyroid disorders.\u00a0\u00a0I've had an MRI of my brain and liver, which were both normal. I have had elevated ALT and AST liver enzymes for about a year now even before any of this started. (ALT 134) (AST 76) I don't drink.Are these symptoms (lightheadedness and muscle ridgidity) likely still side effects from the Abilify or could it be something more sinister related to my Gastroparesis?\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know of any neurological disorders associated with elevated AST and ALT liver enzymes? Are there any further tests that I should request my PCP to run?Thank you very much.",
