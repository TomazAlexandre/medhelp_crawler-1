            "answer": "Hi there,I'm another volunteer, also not a medical professional - so you should check in with the physician(s) that you work with for their opinions.Diabetics often have an excess of glucose in our blood streams and this excess can cause the types of damage that RL mentioned in his answer.\u00a0\u00a0One common area of damage is to our nervous system and that can result in a condition called \"neuropathy\" -- you can read about that condition in your medical references, I'm sure.Neuropathy can result in both a lack of appropriate sensation (poorly controlled diabetics, for example, might step on a tack and not feel any pain -- and they therefore risk devastating infections ...) and also phantom pains without an obvious trigger.\u00a0\u00a0This is similar to what you described in your question.\u00a0\u00a0Both the lack of sensation and the phantom pains result from a damaged nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0Another form of neuropathy is gastroparesis, which affects the digestive tract.Hope this helps, too.",
