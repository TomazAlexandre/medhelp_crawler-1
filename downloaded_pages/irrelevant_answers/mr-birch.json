            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Your husband is probably having some neurological problem involving one half of body. There is a chance that there is compression of the spinal nerves in the cervical spine region. This can cause numbness and loss of function in one half of body if compression is high up. `The other possibility of similar symptoms in one half of body is TIA or transient ischemic attack. To diagnose a TIA or mini stroke you need to have a MRI close to the episode. If TIA is suspected then all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.This can be a medical emergency, so rush your husband to ER. Take care!",
