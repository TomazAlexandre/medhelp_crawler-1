            "answer": "Hi Max,thanks for query.What you are having probably is tight fore skin and this the reason why you your foreskin is dry and developed cracks. This repeated all the time so your skin has gone sore. The best way is to visit a surgeon and get your self examined. You might require surgery for this know as Circumcision.Wishing you good health.",

            "answer": "Well despite what he said one of the causes for this may be from you masturbating dry. That can cause a lot of issues if you masturbate frequently. So definitely use a lube you do. Aldo make sure you wash with a good non-irriating soap when you wash and wash under your foreskin when you do. Also, you might have to look into circumsition if it gets worse. But also tight foreskin is common and is not necessarily a bad thing, you just have to loosen the skin up a bit (research it) Hope this helps :)",

    "question": "Age: 19Weight: 60kgsLenght: 1.78mSexual activity: noneMedical history: UsedIn the past 6 months, my foreskin has become dryer and dryer. This hasn't really bothered me, I occasionely acquired a wound that would heal the day after when mastrubating dry.Recently I had some intense activity(lol) and my foreskin became sore. It started looking red. I noticed my foreskin became tighter the day after and when pulling it back it hurt even more(did this in warm water.Yesterday(this is about 5 days later) it looked like it was healing, the skin peeling off was gone and it wasn't sore anymore. So i got a boner & jacked off, i immediately noticed a stinging pain, cracks developped on my foreskin !Now(1 day later) my foreskin is all dry and cracked. It sometimes hurt. I've been looking for causes and i think it's a yeast infection(from washing it with soap, i noticed the dryness so i quit using soap, but this didn't help) that developped over time. I don't think i have diabetes and all the sex i've had was protected, so it's not a STD.According to my own research the best is to apply an OCT creme until the yeast infection(wich causes the dryness) is gone, eat some special kind of yoghurt that prevents the infection and then use another creme to heal the cracks completely. After that is done i might start stretching my skin so i can pull it back completely after treatment.Please help me,thanks in advance,max",
