            "answer": "Sammi.I am so sorry to hear that life is being so difficult for you.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with RA 2 years ago and I started treatment with Plaquenil, that didn't help, went to Methotrexate syringe type, tried Arava, NOTHING was even helping, in fact, it was GETTING WORSE!!!\u00a0\u00a0I asked my general physician for a referral to a new rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0That new rheumatologist wanted some labs from me before he would see me.\u00a0\u00a0One of the things he tested me for was hcv.\u00a0\u00a0Lo and behold, the test was positive!\u00a0\u00a0The rheumatologist immediately took me off of all my RA meds and\u00a0\u00a0wanted me to see a gastroenterologist before I saw him.\u00a0\u00a0I did and talked about treatment for my hcv.\u00a0\u00a0The gastroenterologist wanted me to see the rheumatologist before I started treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I did that and the rheumatologist told me that people with hcv often falsley test positive for RA.\u00a0\u00a0He thinks that I DO NOT have RA but rather, just the symptoms frequently associated with hcv!!!\u00a0\u00a0The rheumatologist thinks I do have ostoearthritis because I have some nodules on my fingers and feet that would be associated with that rather than RA.\u00a0\u00a0He also diagnosed me with fibromyalgia and feels that a lot of symptoms are from that, too.\u00a0\u00a0I should also mention that my gastro tested me for cryoglobulenemia which has symptoms which are also very similar to RA.Have you been tested for Cryoglobulenemia?\u00a0\u00a0How do you know that you have RA?\u00a0\u00a0I was told by my rheummy that my pain should improve with successful treatment for my hcv (I am type 1a).Just some food for thought.\u00a0\u00a0I do feel better after stopping treatment for RA so the meds were not doing me ANY good!!You may have a totally different situation but I have heard of many people with hcv being mistakenly diagnosed with RA.If you would like to correspond with me about this you can let me know and I'll trade email addresses with you.Take care and best wishes.Smiles, Sue",

            "answer": "hi my name is ruby87 from uk.just found your message boards today.and i cant tell you the relief i have had from reading them.especially this thread.as i went to the doctor for all these tests and tested negative the first time 18 months ago and then again a few months ago.i had purple and red spots and my legs swollen legs and ankles ulcers on my legs and was in agony.this cleared up the first time after a few weeks maybe 5weeks.then it came again as i said a few months ago not as bad as the first time and i got all the tests again which proved negative.but i checked out the web because my doctor was happy to leave things.i saw on the web that people with these symptoms often have hepb or hepc.so i got a lft.which was slighly high.first time gamma gt90 alt54 and then second time gamma gt 80 and alt 95 third time gamma gt 70 alt54.so i got a test called hepseriology because i had had hepb 33 years ago and this was to find out if it had come back.this test finds any other liver viruses.and i tested positive for hepc.i must say though.i changed my diet while all those tests were being done because it tood a good few weeks maybe 6weeks or more for all the tests and waiting on results.i got sandra cabots liver cleansing diet.i didnt stick to it religiously but cut out all dairy foods (except a little milk in tea and coffee.) and cut out sugar and sweets which i was overeating on and eating all the wrong foods instead of meals and my ankles have improved immensly (sorry about spelling) all my joints have improved.saying that though i am still in pain in writs fingers back and most of my skelleton but you wouldnt believe how much i have improved since i changed my diet i would never be able to copewith that level of pain.seeminly its an auto immune reaction trying to clear the virus there is plenty on the web about it.type in auto immune diseases and hepc.but this is the first i'v read from real people.hope this is a help to you.good luck and god bless us all.ruby87",

Finally I have the answers now all they have to do if figure out how to treat, there is no cure for the scleroderma or the pulmonary fibrosis. if anyone would like to email my address is ***@****. I know this is going to be an uphill battle but it was such a relief to finally see a dr. that knew exactly where my pain is and why.

    "question": "I have chronic hep c, underwent tx 3 yrs ago, failed. I am now diagnosed with RA, raynaud's phenom and diabetes. I am hoping to find a dr. that has treated someone with my diseases, so far I underwent Remicade tx for the RA and had to be taken off the tx due to severe side effects. I live in Illinois does anybody know of a dr. that can treat my problems. My gp referred me to a rheumatologist in Mo., waited 3 months to see her and a week before the appt. the drs office called and cancelled the appt. now waiting for another appt. in 8 weeks. If anybody can refer me to another dr. I would greatly appreciate it. the RA is so severe I am unable to drive, work, clean my house. please help if you know of a dr. that has worked with someone with all these problems. thanks so much, I am taking methotrexate, folic acid, and pain pills to get thru each minute.",
