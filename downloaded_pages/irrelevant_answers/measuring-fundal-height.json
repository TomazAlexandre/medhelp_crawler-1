            "answer": "It's definitely not an exact sort of thing. Measuring larger or smaller doesn't mean you will go sooner/later. At 33 weeks I was measured to be 27 weeks and even till the day I delivered I was always several weeks behind. (I believe at 39 weeks the measurement was 34 cm) I've seen some measure 4 weeks ahead and still have their babies on/around their due dates.",

            "answer": "I'm 33 weeks, and since my midwife started measuring my fundal height, I've always been measuring ahead. At 27 weeks I was measuring at 36cm, and it's constantly been above average. Now at 33 weeks, my bump is measuring at 40, which should obviously mean my little girl should be on her way, but theres no chance of that yet, shes just a big baby and im carrying far too much water. Hope it helps x",

    "question": "My last 2 appointments, I've been measuring 2 cm ahead, and I was wondering if anyone else measured ahead and went early? I know they say it's \"give or take 2 cm\" but I'm hoping that since it's been consistently 2 cm bigger, that means maybe I'll go 1-2 weeks early! Obviously I want whats best for my bean and if that means being pregnant for 42 weeks, so be it. But it'd be awesome if I could go at 38-39 weeks! What has everyone else experienced with this?",
