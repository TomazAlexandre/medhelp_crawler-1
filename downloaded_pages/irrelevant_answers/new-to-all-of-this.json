            "answer": "Fasting glucose: 62This is low and dangerous if was measured in mg/dl. It helps us understand better when you post your measurement results in full. This forum is visited by people from around the world. Different countries use different scales. In The USA mg/dl is mostly used, where the UK uses mmol/L.Impaired Glucose toleranceTwo hours after drinking the test liquid you measure 140-199 mg/dl. You don't mention what your two hour level was.I bought a store brand glucose meter..Hopefully you read the instruction manual carefully and \"calibrated\" the test strips with the meter or your results will be inaccurate.I use the excellent Johnson & Johnson's Lifescan OneTouch meters. You can set the meter to read in either mmol/L or mg/dl. You can get a free meter by going here https://www.onetouchgold.com/simplestart/ and filling out the questionaire. However, it does take approx 6 weeks for delivery but well worth the wait.I carry glucose tablets if I feel low, and have eliminated all sugars exceptHuh? If you blood sugar drops below 70 mg/dl you eat something sugary, like candy, to normalize your glucose. Are these tablets doctor approved? If you're hyperglycemic, it is wise to to eliminate/cut back on sugars.If you can't afford health insurance you can look for a Nurse Practioner in your community. They are trained like doctors, can perform full examinations including tests, write prescriptions, but cannot perform surgery in any form. Cheaper than a doctor but still cost $$. At issue is your fasting glucose level and what your real after meal glucose ranges are.You should get an HbgA1c test. To borrow from another poster, \"This test assist doctors by determining your glucose levels over the past 3 months. Red cells live an average of 3 months. Excess glucose will remain on new red cells and the HgBA1c will measure this.\"",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your help. The measurements listed were in USA mg/dl. I was told that my range needed to be 90-110. The glucose tablets were a nurse practitioner's suggestion. I only take one if it is absolutely necessary, like when I go below 70, but for the most part, I just try to eat something. She also told me that she doesn't want me to eliminate all carbs, due to the fact that I could lose weight. I will request the HbgA1c test on my next visit. I am trying to take all the right steps so I can avoid medication, but with all the fatigue and headaches, that may be my next step. Thank you again and good luck to you as well.",

    "question": "I wasn't for sure where to post this question, but I know that the people on this site are a great resource for similar experiences. I am a 20 year old female, 5'8\" 110 pounds (skinny, I know) and I don't have medical insurance, but was given an oral glucose tolerance test through the health department. I am a college student who works full-time, and I will have insurance when I graduate. My results were as follows: Fasting glucose: 62 After drinking the solution: 197, an hour later: 161. I was diagnosed with Impaired Glucose tolerance, and to my research that means pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I bought a store brand glucose meter and tested on several occasions, to which my highest reading was 210 after meals, and 59 fasting. My maternal grandmother is the only known person in our family to have diabetes (type II). I carry glucose tablets if I feel low, and have eliminated all sugars except for some carbohydrates, in fear of losing weight. My question is, if my condition makes a switch to type II, what can I do to make it better? It's not like I don't get enough exercise or need to lose any weight. Can anyone here give me any information to help me out? Thank you for your time.",
