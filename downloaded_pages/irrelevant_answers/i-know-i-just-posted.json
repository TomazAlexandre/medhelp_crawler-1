For example if your test came back that you would need to be put on medication they would call you in as soon as they could. Don't worry so much I am sure your tests came back perfect. Even if your tests came back that you have gestational diabetes it isn't that bad I have it and all I have to do is test my blood sugar 3-4 times a day,",
