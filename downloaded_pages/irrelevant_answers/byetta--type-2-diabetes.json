    "question": "I have been on Byetta (stomach injections)for about 8 months.\u00a0\u00a0The first 6 months was the lowest dosage and now it is doubled (the highest dosage).\u00a0\u00a0There is no rhyme or reason concerning the A1C levels - currently 7.6%! and I have not lost any weight either - which is suppose to be a side affect (one I was looking forward to).\u00a0\u00a0My blood work is good for my heart disease, but not for the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I teach exercise classes but also have fibromyalgia and ostioarthritis, so exercising more would really be a chore; I've cut back on portions and have introduced more fruit and vegetables in my diet. I know if I lost at least 25lbs, I would feel better and hopefully get my A1C down. HELP - What else can I do to loose weight?",
