            "answer": "DJD would be an uncommon cause of this symptom.Looking for metabolic diseases like diabetes or thyroid conditions can be considered.An infection would be the most common possibility, and should be evaluated with a urinalysis.If the symptoms continue, despite the Detrol, you may want to consider a referral to a urologist.\u00a0\u00a0Tests like a post-void residual and urodynamic tests can be done to evaluate for any functional causes of the frequency.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "I am F, age 56, 5'7\", 140 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I have a history of frequent urination, which I just chalked up to all the water I drink (although, even if I avoided liquids in anticipation of a long dentist appt., for example, I still would go just as often).\u00a0\u00a0Lately, however, I have experienced some additional symptoms:\u00a0\u00a0Feeling of pressure in my bladder even after urinating (as if I'm not finished); waking up MUCH more often (4 times or more) to go to the bathroom at night.\u00a0\u00a0This is not constant (there are some nights I only get up once, and I sat at dinner recently for 2 hours without going) but it happens enough that I am really bothered now.\u00a0\u00a0Last night, I'd go to the bathroom, but no sooner I'd get back in bed, and the bladder pressure would be back.\u00a0\u00a0There is urine in the bladder when I go back to the bathroom -- i.e., it's not like there's nothing there -- but there's not so much that I should've felt bladder pressure.\u00a0\u00a0My gyno suspected a possible bladder infection and prescribed Macrobid 100 mg for 5 days.\u00a0\u00a0That ended last week and has not eliminated the problem.\u00a0\u00a0She also gave me a sample of Detrol-LA, which I tried in desperation last night, but I understand may take a few days.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have \"sudden\" urges, nor do I leak.\u00a0\u00a0I'd prefer not to take Detrol as I am very susceptible to side effects and Detrol can cause dry mouth.\u00a0\u00a0And I don't seem to fit the classic Detrol profile (sudden urges, leakage).\u00a0\u00a0But I do need to always be near a bathroom.\u00a0\u00a0My gyno said it did not appear my uterus had dropped significantly enough to be causing this.\u00a0\u00a0Could my severe degenerative disk disase (lumbar and cervical) be a cause?\u00a0\u00a0Should I have more tests or just take the Detrol and see if it helps?\u00a0\u00a0What do you think is causing this?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
