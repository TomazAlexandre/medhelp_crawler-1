            "answer": "What tests have you had?No special diet...just eat good food.Stress does not help thyroid problems one little bit.As far as waiting to eat or drink is concerned, the \"rule\" is \"don't eat or drink anything for 1/2 to 1 hour after taking meds\".\u00a0\u00a0However, I have also read that the key is consistency.\u00a0\u00a0If you have your coffee right after taking med \"every\" morning, tehn there isn't much of an issue.\u00a0\u00a0If the coffee blocks absorption of some of the meds, you just might end up taking a bit more to compensate.\u00a0\u00a0However, no milk or milk products in that coffee!\u00a0\u00a0Calcium definitely interferes with absorption.",

            "answer": "I took your advice and get that shower in to help make the time go quicker. Some people say that it takes a good month for everything to even out. It seems like I am catching up on sleep. Also if I mow the yard, or try to walk on the treadmill for an hour it seems like alot. Just feel old at 43.goolarra -thanks for telling me about the milk products. Didnt know that. Thought that maybe some foods were more sensitive to this like with Gout or diabetes. Actually I drink alot more: coffee, soda, water,and have to remind myself to eat something.My side of the family has had some type of medical disfunction since they were 17. I am lucky it didnt catch up with me until now. I just want to make sure to know the differences make sure everything is ok so other things dont break down so quickly.",
