            "answer": "the fact that you're conceiving and have regular cycles seems to suggest that you don't. my partner has had 2 pregnancies and she weighed 230 at the start of each.. so weight alone is certainly not a prohibitive factor if all else is fine. in my case, i used to weigh around 270 and i think because of that, my hormones were off, ovulation didnt happen regularly, hence the inability to conceive. as soon as i got the weight off, periods came back on their own. in your case.. do you see an RE? this is something i think they could look for via u/s and test for, PCOS women usually have high testosterone. but again, irregular periods is one of the first things they ask about. since you're conceiving, seems they ought to be looking in other places for answers.",

            "answer": "I have PCOS. At first i was diagnosed with hypothriodism. your thyriod control alot. Metabolism, mood, energy levels, ect...then a while later was when i was diagnosed with PCOS. My periods are very irreg. I have them at the most 3 times per year and the last only 3-4 days. I had a ultra sound of my ovaries and had only 1 cyst, so I thought for sure I didn't have PCOS but the rest of the symptoms i have, overweight, acne(thank God for olay daily facials), excess hair on face(what would I do without wax?) so the doctor diagnosed me with it. He put me on a med called metphormin.the reason I went to the doctor in the first place was because i started gaining weight without changing my diet. I have eventually put on 70 pds. and because my mood was never predictable. One minute I would be happy the next mad at the world. I am always tired.One of the main symptoms of PCOS is not being able to concieve. Before I got preg with my daughter i only had 1 period. then i got preg agian and had my son. the doctors can't even explian it and tell me I am extremley lucky. After my son I went 4 years without bc and didn't get preg. I think PCOS is a wierd diagnoses. Nobody is the same. everybodys story is different. If you think you have it, it doesn't hurt to ask your doctor. My endocrynoligist said there is no test for it. The way you are diagnosed is if your symptoms add up.Maybe ask your doctor to check your thyriod????",

I did not have irregular periods but they were long 35 days regularly. So do you have long cycles as this is another sign of PCOS. my gyno diagnosed me with a Trans vaginal u/s it was the first thing he did and he said \"Do you see all those black dots they are cysts and you my dear have PCOS.\" He also told me that any cycle that is well over 28 days is not normal. I was anovulatory and I had lost 15 kg thinking that weight was an issue. It did't help and I am now on my 2nd clomid cycle and I o'd both months, 29day cycle the first month so now it is just up to timing the BDing this month.",

Once I found out I had PCOS the doctor told me I could never conceive normally. I lost a total of 40lbs and ended up pregnant (naturally). I found out when I was already 12 weeks. Missing cycles was normal for me and the last thing I thought about was being pregnant. My signs of PCOS was missing cycles, excessive hair and the diabetes. You need to ask your doctor because I wouldnt have know if the doctor didnt took some test. When they did the ultrasound I had a cycst the size of a golf ball. If you suspect you might have it ask your doctor. If you do then the doctor should take steps or lead you to better information and treatment.Nena",
