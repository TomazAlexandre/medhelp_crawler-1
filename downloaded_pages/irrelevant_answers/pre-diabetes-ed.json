I've also noticed that I still get erections during my sleep but not during the day.",

    "question": "After seeing my urologist and getting some tests done, I was found to be pre-diabetic and also have low testosterone.\u00a0\u00a0The doc has injected me with testosterone shots twice which bumped my T levels, but ultimately has had no real effect on my ED issues. It's hard to get an erection, have almost no sex drive, and don't have as much sensitivity as I used to down there. I notice that when I watch porn I would get an erection, but even then it wasn't 100% hard.I get random erections during the night, but can never get them during the day. My urologist seems to just want to inject me with T shots instead of any other possible treatments. What else can I do to change my current circumstances? Are there any particular tests I can take to try to determine the actual cause of my situation? I don't want to rely on medication because that just masks the actual issue; I want a permanent rather than a temporary solution.I'm 5'11 and weigh 180lbs. I've changed my diet and eat more fruits and exercise a little bit more. Now I tend to urinate very frequently, around 10 times or more a day. Also it doesn't come out with force as it used it. Another thing is my testicles seem to feel smaller and the scrotum seems to be saggy and not firm. All these changes are really starting to worry me.I'm currently attempting to refrain from masturbating for a few months to see if that could help the situation because I have read that porn could be a factor in ED. This is having a huge toll on my life so any help or direction on what I should do is appreciated.",
