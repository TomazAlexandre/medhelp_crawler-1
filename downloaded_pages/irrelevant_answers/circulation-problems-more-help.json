            "answer": "I suggest you make an appointment to see your doctor.By what you describe, you may have diabetes and the doctor would be able to take a blood test to find out if that is the case.Having low iron levels can make you feel light headed and weak too.But also if your sugar levels drop too low causing hypoglycaemia, this can make you feel sick and shaky.\u00a0\u00a0You do not need to be a diabetic to suffer from hypoglycaemia.With you complaining of erectile problems and tingling sensations this can be through having diabetes.Get checked out as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Undiagnosed diabetes and high uncontrolled sugar levels can lead to nerve damage.",

    "question": "Okay...I went to the gym a few days ago and noticed after running on the treadmill I felt very lightheaded and weak..I had to sit down and take a breather: I attributed this to not working out in a couple of months. I worked out again today and after running on the treadmill and lifting some weights I felt very weak again...to the point that I had to take a seat. I soon felt very sick...as if I had to puke...my hands and legs felt numb (pins and needles). Then my stomach started aching and I felt so weak I had to lay down. My lower abdomen felt like it was heating up...I was feeling horrible. After a few minutes I gained enough energy to run to the bathroom and handle my business (I had diarrhea). While in the bathroom I sweating a bit and my hands and legs were still tingling. By the way this has happened to me in the past. I was back to normal a few min after leaving the restroom.I am a 24 yr old male.I also noticed that there are times I have trouble keeping an erection and RARELY am able to have one while standing up. Idk if that could be b/c of masturbating while sitting or laying only.I also notice my hands and feet go numb while sitting or laying in certain positions.Are these two problems related? Could it be a circulation issue?I am embarrassed to write all of this, but I am deeply concerned and need some sort of advice.Any ideas what's wrong with me?",
