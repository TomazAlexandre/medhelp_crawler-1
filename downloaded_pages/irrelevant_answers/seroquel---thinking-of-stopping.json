            "answer": "Seroquel is the only anti-psychotic with the risk of causing cataracts. There are of course other options. As for antipsychotics they can cause diabetes but that can be managed with a proper diet. You may have acquired cataracts from another cause than the Seroquel but if you did its not from the onset of diabetes. Its a seperate cause and there are many other antipsychotics, the 3 newest with the least risk of weight gain being Abilify, Fanapt and Saphris. As well there are many other mood stabilizers that are not antipsychotics. Here is a full list:http://www.psycheducation.org/depression/meds/moodstabilizers.htmSpeak to your psychiatrist about this.",

            "answer": "Well from the prescription information what was explained to me by my psychiatrist when I started it is still the official conclusion which is that it came up in animal studies and there are no specific rates for people but that anyone who takes Seroquel should be tested for cataracts twice a year. For me it was easy because having nystagmus I see an orthopedist anyway. This is the official prescribing information for Seroquel:http://www1.astrazeneca-us.com/pi/seroquelxr.pdf",

    "question": "I am on Seroquel for Bipolar Disorder. Had 3 eye examinations, one of them at a community health check which said I have cataract and need operation. Second examination at specialist eye hospital - see no cataract. Third examination - slight cataract. I am 60 and the doctor at the eye hospital (before he came up with a verdict of \"see no cataract\" commented - cataract at 60? What is going on in this world?My father was diabetic which probably contributed to a stroke. I have seen how a diabetic patient suffers. In my case, my mood disorder don't seem as serious as many about whom I read about in forums and other websites like this.I am putting these 2 on a weighing scale - take seroquel and run the risk of getting diabetes, getting cataract and needing eye operation, etc. etc. Stop medication and run the risk of a relapse. Relapse seemed to me to be less dangerous than getting diabetes and eyesight problems, maybe even blindness. My mood disorder is not as serious as those about whom I read about in forums like this and other websites.I told my doctor. I exercise regularly (I read a study which concluded exercise is effective for depression) and now know myself better. I practice good mental hygiene. Once I got very stressed, a bit on the low side. I take a good nap and I am OK the next morning. So what is the big deal?Feedback please.",
