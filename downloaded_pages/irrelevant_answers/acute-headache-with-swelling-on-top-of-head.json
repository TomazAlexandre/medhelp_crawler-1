            "answer": "Hi,yes most probably the swelling is the result of injury that you suffered but it can also be due to folliculitis which is infammation of the hair follicle and is quite painful. You can take OTC pain killers and see if they help. If the swelling continues to enlarge and the pain increases then please consult your physician.Good luck!",

    "question": "I've been having headaches off and on for a while now but I didn't give them much thought as I have hypogycemia, as well as arthritis and fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0However early this morning I noticed what appears to be a swollen spot on the top of my head, with a smaller spot slightly forward of it.\u00a0\u00a0I had my husband look at them and he said they appear to be slightly discolored, but not red.\u00a0\u00a0They are tender to the touch and I have had a persistent headache, with some nausea.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is sharp, my scalp feels vaguely tight and slightly burning.\u00a0\u00a0I'm trying to determine if this could be serious or not.\u00a0\u00a0I don't remember exactly how long ago, but within the last couple of weeks I was hit in the top of the head by the edge of the trunk lid.\u00a0\u00a0Could I be experiencing pain and swelling from that at this late date?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any help given.Mouse203",
