I think mine is from inflammation. From what I'm reading on these boards, it sounds like it is becoming more common. I've also heard that people can get tingling from a vitamin B deficiency, diabetes, thyroid (mentioned) or a herniated disk. Lack of blood supply, as well can cause tingling/numbness.",
