            "answer": "Dear Kazz,I'm in the same situation as you, trying to stave off or delay what appears to be a certain diagnosis of diabetes. I'm not an expert, and I'm sure you'll get guidance from others who know more than I do. In the meantime, you may want to check out the following articles; the calcium and Vitamin D connection might be just a wild hypothesis or something not yet fully explored. On the other hand, again if you are like me, you probably want to have all the information available in order to know all your possible options.Here are the links:http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/29/3/650http://www.nutraingredients-usa.com/news/ng.asp?id=66807-vitamin-d-calcium-diabetesYou may also want to visit the following site:http://www.diabetesdaily.com/forum/search.php?searchid=192257I hope some or all of this helps a little. Please let me know if you need to vent.Best,LitDoc",

            "answer": "I think the best way to avoid the full blown diabetes is limit your carbs and junk food. It is wise to get a meter and check your Bs because u will find out what the food are that have made it rise. I am beting its either junk food or lots of carbs. I have been a type two for 35 yrs and staved off the drugs up til now. MY Blood pressure went up they put me on med's and now my BS A1c is 7.0 and my alsways perfect Lipids says my Kdl is 100. I say so what it is under the 130 mark, but my dr says it is rising slowing. And it sounds like u too are heading in that direction. So girls I promise by diet alone limit the high carbs and u will do what I was able to do. I got diagnosed back in1973. it out there for u to learn, so please learn it. Knowledge never harms anyone... And knowing the disease that u might get helps u not suffer the side effects, the limb loss, blindness, and kidney faiure. All the diabetics that are in there 60's and 70's didn't have what we have now and this is a new era to change diabetes the other direction. U two can be apart of it, and help others the \"Pre-diabetics\" how not to become type 2, or even 1. Even zinc and vitamin stores have stuff to help u. reserch some all natural approach's first, and a clean diet....Debbie",

            "answer": "Thanks for your thoughts but it's definitely not junk food in my case!!\u00a0\u00a0I cook all my own food, don't eat any processed or junk or convenience foods - my diet is totally low glycaemic index stuff (vegetables, vegetables, vegetables), no fizzy drinks or juices, no sweets/cakes, only whole grain cereals etc.\u00a0\u00a0I LOVE cooking and am very particular about what goes into my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0That's what is so frustrating about all this - my diet is SERIOUSLY healthy!\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly it was pretty crappy when I was a kid (you don't have much control over what your parents feed you) but for the last 15 years or so I've been on the straight and narrow, and bending over backwards not to follow in my relatives' footsteps.\u00a0\u00a0(As I noted above, my blood pressure, weight, lipids etc. are all excellent - due, I believe to my careful diet).\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless I am going to beat this ... somehow!!\u00a0\u00a0Cheers, Kazz",

            "answer": "Like Kazz, I also observe a very healthy, very low-carb diet. I'm a vegetarian, and powerwalk at least one mile a day (usually more). I'm also aware of the necessity for a healthy lifestyle; what I'm trying to find (and send on to those who might also be interested) are tips on what else can possibly be done to stave off the development of this frightening condition. If a simple act like taking a calcium and a Vitame D tablet daily gives us a greater chance of not developing the full-blown disease, or even of developing it a bit later, then it's a very small and worthwhile gesture to make.Thanks again, Strawberri, for always being here for newcomers and everyone else who needs you. You are a gem!LitDoc",

    "question": "I\u2019m descended from at least three generations of people who developed Type 2 diabetes early (in their thirties and forties) and died of it early (in their forties and fifties).\u00a0\u00a0My entire adult life (I am now 40) I\u2019ve worked really hard to prevent it developing \u2013 I\u2019m a fitness fanatic, with a healthy weight and an excellent diet.\u00a0\u00a0Despite all this, my annual check-ups have now indicated that I have \u201cprediabetes\u201d or \u201cimpaired glucose tolerance\u201d.\u00a0\u00a0While I intend to maintain the diet and exercise regime to try and delay the onset of diabetes for as long as I can, I do get a sense that it is inevitable.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor says there's nothing I can do at this stage apart from keeping up the exercise and diet routine, and just told me to come back in a year for another test.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously the diet and exercise routine is NOT stopping the problem as each year my blood glucose reading sneaks up a little more.\u00a0\u00a0Is there really nothing else I can do at this stage?\u00a0\u00a0Should I be seeking a second opinion?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe buying a blood glucose monitor, or finding someone willing to prescribe anti-diabetes drugs?\u00a0\u00a0(Not that I want to take drugs if I can avoid it, but I also don't want to just sit back and watch my pancreas and kidneys fail!)\u00a0\u00a0My recent full blood count showed that my blood sugar was in the prediabetic range and my kidney function slightly below par, but all the other tests had excellent results - my blood pressure, cholesterol, triglycerides, etc. are all excellent.Thanks for your time ;-) Kazz",
