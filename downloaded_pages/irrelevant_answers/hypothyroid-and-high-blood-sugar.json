            "answer": "I can't address your thyroid issues as I have no personal experience with that condition. I suggest you see your your doctor about the sudden need to increase your meds and the hair and skin problems. You might want to check out our Thyroid Forum. The good folks over there may be able to tell you what's going on. But I do recommend you see your doc.I, too, have just been dx'd as prediabetic and I know exactly what you mean about being shocked! There is no history of diabetes in my family and my blood sugar has always been at a good level. I don't understand why suddenly at age 59 I'm just a few points away from having this disease. I'm seeing a lipid specialist next month and hopefully with diet and exercise I can turn this around.Your doctor needs to either help you with a definite plan/goal or send you to someone who can.I wish you the bestPeaceGreenlydia",

            "answer": "I did go to the doctor with no logical explanation for this.\u00a0\u00a0I hope things work out for you. If you can do the simple things. There is really nothing I can do about weight, as I am 5 foot 2 and weigh 125 pounds plus I no one eats like I do.\u00a0\u00a0I eat a very low sugar diet and hardly ever eat out.\u00a0\u00a0If I could do something, I would. I guess this is my punishment for a lifetime of excercise and heathy living.",

Why this is shocking is I have no family history(other than an uncle who was sedentary and had poor diet and old) I have never been overweight, have exercised all my life.\u00a0\u00a0I rarely eat out.\u00a0\u00a0I don't like candy or sugar, I don't drink pop. I don't over consume carbs.I was taking extra fish oil because my skin was itchy.\u00a0\u00a0I am shocked because my doctor tells me I am prediabetic.",
