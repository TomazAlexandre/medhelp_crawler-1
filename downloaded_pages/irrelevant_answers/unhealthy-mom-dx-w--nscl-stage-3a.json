    "question": "Just would like some input please.My Mom is 66.\u00a0\u00a0She went into hospital to have her defibulator change. They found Nodule on chext xray.\u00a0\u00a0Cancelled surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Had Cat, Pet, than Needle biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0Confirmed NSCL 3a.\u00a0\u00a0There is one nodule and it is in one lymphnode behind trachea.They say no to surgery.\u00a0\u00a0They can not put her under due to her VERY bad heart.CHemo is a go and will start in 2wks.Radiation is a go..again about 2 wks.Meantime she has to get her defib changed and they will move to opposite of lung cancer.They told her w/out attempting treatment she might have about 8m-1 yr.\u00a0\u00a0So she is going to try.This is some of her health history. Cariomyapathy...very bad heart, has defib...which has gone off 3x this past yr. B/P runs about 80/40 regularly.COPD end stage...on O2\u00a0\u00a024/7, breathing treatments, inhalers.\u00a0\u00a0She tires easily now due to this. Struggles to breathw/ just a few steps.Diabetes..insulin dependent.I am happy she wants to try the treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Yet at the same time I dont know how she is going tohold up during it.\u00a0\u00a0Im afraid that alone will wear her down and get her.\u00a0\u00a0I dont want her to go thru all the treatment only to die a few mths later.\u00a0\u00a0I want her to be able to enjoy the time she has left as much as possible.I live in NY and she in Fl.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I heard they canc. her surgery and why I drove right down to be here forher and help.\u00a0\u00a0She doesnt drive, and although my sister lives about 9 miles away...well nfortunately she isnt very attentive. To her credit she does have 3 teenage girls.\u00a0\u00a0Guess Im just very scared.Any thoughts, suggestions, advice would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Chris",
