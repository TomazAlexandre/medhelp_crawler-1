Cluster headache is severe headache, is rapid, pain is boring in quality and may cause severe shooting pain in the eye and sometimes radiating to the neck or shoulder.I suggest you to get it evaluated from a physician.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hi Betsey.Yes, Over 30 years of them. Called cluster headaches, & u need to see a good neurolist. First 1 , i ever got, was so extremely painful, i thought of shooting myself.(also known as suicide headaches) Usually seasonal, set off by notious fumes, or tobacco, & alcohol. Verapamil, & a predizone therapy, in\u00a0\u00a0the USA, is about only therapy i know of todate. Also some control from ritalin. If this has only happenned to you once, then it is possible you did not experience same headaches, cas they usually come around same time of day. Hope this helps",
