            "answer": "I would love to see an answer to this. My DD is hypoglycemic at 6 with unknown origins. We will be going to CHOP for further testing to find the cause. She can drop from 137 (through food we can get it high) to 37 in less than 30 minutes, we have been told she rapid drops. She spills ketones and we have Hashimotos, Addisons, Type II Diabetes and Pituitary tumors in our family and all came back normal (clean MRI of brain and pituitary). This roller coaster is scary for all involved and it seems the information is so limited for this age group. The lowest my daughter has gone is low 30s and each time it seems to go lower faster.",
