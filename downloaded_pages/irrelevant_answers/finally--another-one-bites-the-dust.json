    "question": "I haven't been here in some time, just needed to concentrate on me while I was on my 6th treatment with Harvoni and Riba.\u00a0\u00a0I was a 3 time non responder with Interferon and Infergen, had a viral breakthrough with Incivek, relapsed with Sovaldi and SVR'd with Harvoni!\u00a0\u00a0Been around the block with treatments.\u00a0\u00a0Finally received that call we all wait for...congratulations, you are cured!I knew when I had relapsed on Sovaldi, 6 weeks post the muscle and joint pain returned with a vengeance.\u00a0\u00a0Once that pain had lessened with Harvoni it never returned, I continued to feel better ~ I'd forgotten how good I felt once upon a time.\u00a0\u00a0I am a genotype 1, forget whether a or b and don't really care now, Stage 4 Cirrhosis. Treated for 24 weeks with Riba thrown in at 5 weeks. During my years of being positive, I developed neuropathy and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Hoping now that my liver may begin working a little better the diabetes will subside.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not using as much insulin as before, so it's time to get serious,\u00a0\u00a0eat a whole lot better and get myself back in order.\u00a0\u00a0I am so ready to be me again.Hang in there friends!\u00a0\u00a0Harvoni is really working especially for us difficult to treat peeps.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment was easy, even with the Riba ~ I knew what that drug was all about!\u00a0\u00a0I'm CURED, I'm HAPPY as a frog and I'm going to LIVE LIFE like never before.\u00a0\u00a0 :)",
