    "question": "Hi, My mom has a type1 diabetes with a lot of ups and downs in blood sugar. So I always look for some interesting posts about diabetes. I want to share with you a post I saw in this Facebook group (http://www.facebook.com/VoteDeadSea ).The post is about a research conducted by the Ben Gurion Univ.\u00a0\u00a0They claim that a swim in the Dead Sea water effects the blood sugar - very interesting foundings, but for now it's for type2 only. (I hope they will have enoght funds for a type1 research as well)You can read more details about the research here: http://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=272787479398846What do you think, it it real or does it give false hope to diabetics? (To tell you the true, my mom never said that a swim in the Dead sea, had done miracles for her blood sugar, and she visits the Dead sea once a year at least)",
