            "answer": "I felt that way. I was told I would be delivering weeks early with my first but when I was gonna go in it was 2 days before my dad's bday so I asked to wait but it was a serious health issue and it couldn't happen. We did bring her home on my dad's bday which was still pretty amazing to me (my dad passed almost 5 years before). You just have to do what happens. Like this time I'm due the day my husband found out his cousin killed himself the night before so I feel super obligated to have her at least a few days early so those days are not connected but I finally got to thinking it's gonna happen when it happens.",

    "question": "My official due date is 3 days before my fathers birthday. He is super excited and wants his first grandchild to have the same birthday as him. My problem is that I feel obligated to make sure it happens even if I have no control. My father has diabetes and barely takes care of himself. My question is has any of you felt this obligated before?",
