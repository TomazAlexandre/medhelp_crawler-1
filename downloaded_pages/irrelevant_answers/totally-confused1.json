            "answer": "You need to speak with your doctor and get a plan of treatment going for your diabetes. Then you need to follow the doctor's instructions. Diabetes is not something you can ignore and think it will go away. It won't. The consequences of not treating diabetes are very severe. Only your doctor can determine your diabetes type by doing a c-peptide test to see how much insulin you are producing and an antibody test. Type 1 is an antibody condition and type 2 is not. Your regular doctor may not be knowledgeable about types and just assume you are type 2 due to your age. You need to get on a program of diet, exercise and medication. It sounds like you are doing well with the first two and need to be more regular with the third. What you also need to do is test your blood sugar daily. You want your fasting to be under 100 and your 2 hours after meals to be under 140. Rice and ice cream are not good foods for diabetics. Testing 2 hours after meals will tell you what you can eat and how much. You need to eat regular meals to avoid hypoglycemia. Exercise also affects blood sugar so test, test, test. The best treatment for lows is glucose tablets.",

            "answer": "Thank you very much for your prompt response, You told someone that \" all diabetics are different\" this concludes that what kind of I am, is to be assessed by me under the guidance of a knowledgeable doctor with regular tests of different types. Look ! I think that my pancreas does not produce insulin on target times, the time when the food is in the stomach. But it keeps on producing slowly and that is the why I go low with sugar level if don't take food for a longer period. Anyways, let you know after the tests you recommended.\u00a0\u00a0I think am not over weight, my height is 5.7 and I am 70 kgs with an age of 53. My parents both were diabetics, I have been a professional supports man (a football player) and have been playing untill late 40's still have the habit of walking, but not that regular. Now one thing very important, please advise me, My blood pressure is upset 150/100, is it related to my diabetic levels. Because last time three years back I did experience the same feeling, like struck and giddy head, as I do these days and my blood pressure was upset\u00a0\u00a0accompanied by my upset sugar levels.Thanks again.jd312701",

            "answer": "Many type 2's have a cluster of other problems which include\u00a0\u00a0blood pressure and cholesterol. As for type, it is not something you need \"regular tests\" for. The simple presence or absence of antibodies clearly confirms type 1 or type 2. They are different conditions with different treatments needed.When I say \"all diabetics are different\" I mean in terms of our response to diet, exercise, carbs and medications.",

    "question": "Three years back I found\u00a0\u00a0my glucose levels\u00a0\u00a0high. I talked to my pyisician, a professor, who advised me \"glucovince\" 250 mg. But I was, I don't know why, scared and took just 1/4 of the tablet daily in the morning time , cut down my food intake, started walking 5 kilometer in the evening. With this whole practice I began experiencing hypoglycemia events every now and then which I handled with\u00a0\u00a0taking ice cream or a soft drink. Then I quit medicine but continued with exercise (walking) and less and right type of intake for diabetes, and keep checking my glucose levels which were found normal in fasting and random; for a period of 18 months. I became relaxed and didn't get myself checked for the last one and half year. I had some problem with my BP so visited my physician to have the advice and\u00a0\u00a0got my sugar levels checked, as well, having taken rice so that the true position could be known. It was 270mg/dl. Nex day I just cut down my food intake. I had a hypoglycemia event at around 6 in the evening and took ice cream hurriedly to cope with the condition. Please help me what is this and how can i deal with the situation. what type of diabetes is this. I am 53, smoker and off and on walk 5 kilometer. I am afraid of taking medicine and know it would certainly reduce my sugar level.",
