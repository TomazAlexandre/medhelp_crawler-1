            "answer": "Hi there.First of all I'm sorry to hear that you are going through all these.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that you might need to take this back to your surgeon as the wound is taking too long to heal.\u00a0\u00a0The possible reasons for this poor wound healing is an associated infection where in you might have to be started on antibiotics; or maybe you have other problems like diabetes or hypertension that is hindering the proper healing of wound.\u00a0\u00a0Nutritional status is also important for good wound healing, make sure you have enough calorie and protein intake for the day.Make sure to discuss all of these possibilities with your surgeon.\u00a0\u00a0I hope your biopsy will heal completely soon, though It's good to hear that the result of the biopsy is just fibroadenoma.Regrads and God bless...",

            "answer": "I am going to have a Stereotactic Biopsy on April 22nd. I have large breast and the calcification clusters they want to biopsy seem to be deep in my breast. I hated to ask the doctor about the risks of infection or healing but really wanted to know. Do you have any idea what I should expect. I have no underlying illness which might delay healing. Can I wear a bra to work after this is done.\u00a0\u00a0Will there be pain associated with the biopsy? Or in the healing process?",

    "question": "I went for a biopsy to remove a lump from my left breast about 3 weeks ago and diagnostics was it is a firboandenoma. The wound seemed to be healing well for 2 weeks before it started bleeding. The initial bleeding was quite a lot and the blood was quite black in color. After consulting with the surgeon that did the biopsy, i was told that it was the \"old blood\" accumulated from the biopsy that was leaking out. He pressed out the blood and when it was not leaking anymore, put a tiny bandage on it. He told me to wait and see if it was still bleeding and I had to reopen the wound again if\u00a0\u00a0bleeding still reoccurs. That was about 1.5 week ago. My wound kept bleeding slightly on and off after that. I notice that the incision edges seemed to be healing but the middle of the incision kept bleeding slightly. I would like to know, why is it taking so long to heal and if it is advisable for me to see the surgeon again to reopen the wound. I am quite worried that it is not healing and cannot sleep well because of this. Is it common to bleed like that? What could be the possible cause?",
