            "answer": "I agree with Utah ... being a Cancer survivor doesn't have to be as your Endo is letting you be.\u00a0\u00a0It is unacceptable and totally not the end of the line .. once you get your meds sorted out you will feel better ...... once you feel better you will be able to see life in a new way .... it has brought about a profound change in me ... I no longer take things for granted, etc., etc., but until they get those meds right, it can be a spiralling roller coaster which you need a good Doc to get off of.I agree, you may need two docs ..C~pap micro's 1/07synthroid 75mcgsTSH 1.8",

            "answer": "I agree that you need to find a dr that's an endo specialist and know that you are not alone. There are lots of people suffering with these same problems. Stay persistent and keep trying. I personally have been on meds for 6 months and feel worse than I did before. My endo refuses everything so I have found a new one.Good luck!",

    "question": "I feel like I have to do all the work...reading...studying..learning about my thyroid disease because I am desperate to feel better. At this time I literally feel like I am dying..I have to force myself out of bed ..hold myself up.. among symptom after disabling symptom. Ive\u00a0\u00a0came to the point where I demanded my endo dr an adrenal...cortisol test..with a big fat NO ..My endo dr is intimidating, and grouchy.She has however increased my synthroid ( which I m convinced has horrible side effects). I have learned that synthroid\u00a0\u00a0effects the potency of my insulin's ( im type 1)..Ive went from 7-10\u00a0\u00a0units fast acting before each meal to 25 units..also 30 units of long term to 60 units. I was a beautiful young woman in my early 30s /did\u00a0\u00a0have a career , now I can barley get out of bed,Ive read ,many many posts about how lives have slipped them by with this thyroid disease ( synthroid vs armour) and they practically missed their children grow up ( I have 2 preteen boys and 1 teen girl). By law does an endo dr have to comply with my requests for tests?",
