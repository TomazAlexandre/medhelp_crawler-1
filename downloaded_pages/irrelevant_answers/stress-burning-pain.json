            "answer": "Stress can lower your resistance to bugs, but not exactly cause your skin to burn.If you feel that all your skin on your body feels like burning, and you haven't been sunbathing or had exposure to any irritants, it is likely to be due to a fever either from a bacterial or viral infection.Depending on your age, if you are on starting the change of life that can make you feel very hot, called hot flushes sometimes referred to as hot flashes.Another reason why certain parts of the skin may feel like burning is if you suffer from diabetes and have peripheral nerve damage.Have a cool bath or shower to cool down the skin and don't use any soaps that may irritate and dry the skin.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "I'm just back from the doctors today. I have a red dry rash around my mouth which they say is some sort of allergy to food. I haven't been eating anything different (I'm quite a plain eater). Anyway I am a highly stressed out person anything and everything stresses me out so when I asked my doctor about this she said there's a high chance that my burning itchy skin can be stress. I've been given allergy tablets and some steroid cream so here's hoping it works.",

            "answer": "Have you presented your symptoms to your doctor and what did the doctor say that it is?Problems in the legs and feet can be referred pain from the lower spine and also peripheral nerve damage due to diabetes and other reasons.Your palm pains may be part of the peripheral nerve damage or from compression of nerves in the carpal tunnel that is in the wrist area.Your flu like symptoms may have just been a viral or bacterial infection that you picked up a few days prior and when the immune system is weak or compromised the flue and cold develops.\u00a0\u00a0It may have nothing to do with the sex and may just be coincidental.\u00a0\u00a0As I believe contamination from droplets of virus or bacteria take longer than 1 day to incubate, but I am not 100% certain of how long to exposure to germs will make cold and flu symptoms appear.You need to go back to your doctor to get checked out for any nerve damage, if you have diabetes or are low in Vitamin B12 in your blood.",

            "answer": "You should see your doctor like I suggested in my previous reply to you.Swelling can be from a number of different causes, so you should tell your doctor about this too.\u00a0\u00a0Depends where the swelling is.\u00a0\u00a0If in your feet this can be from poor blood circulation, kidney or heart conditions, that is why you need to go back and see your doctor.You do not need to have any rashes on the skin for there to be a problem.\u00a0\u00a0Rashes on the skin can be from internal or external allergies and problems.\u00a0\u00a0But underlying skin problems like swelling and feeling hot can be from other causes.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor may check your blood pressure and may prescribe diuretics if there is a lot of fluid retention that is causing the swelling.If the swelling is caused by arthritic problems this needs to be treated differently.\u00a0\u00a0Pins and needles need to be investigated to rule out any underlying problem.\u00a0\u00a0Stress, anxiety and depression can exacerbate any problem.",
