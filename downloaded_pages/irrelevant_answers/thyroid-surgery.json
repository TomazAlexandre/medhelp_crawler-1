            "answer": "If your calcium levels are fine now than you don't have to worry - the other parathyroids are working fine.It is very, very difficult for even the best surgeon in the world to avoid the parathyroid glands.\u00a0\u00a0Often they are embedded in the thyroid tissue.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us who have had thyroid surgery have lost a parathyroid gland or two.\u00a0\u00a0Mine were so embedded in the \"sticky\" thyroid tissue that they couldn't be saved - same with most of my family.",

    "question": "Dear Dr Lupo,I had a thyroid surgery a couple of months ago (one lobe and the isthmus were taken out). I had done some research prior to it and found a very experienced surgeon, who was also a member of the American Association\u00a0\u00a0of endocrine surgeons. The surgery showed that my nodule was benign. However, at the post-surgery visit my surgeon said, \"By the way, you should know that I removed two of your parathyroid glands. They were so close to your thyroid\u00a0\u00a0and with an incision so small it was difficult to separate them. Don't worry, your other two glands will take care of everything. \" I was shocked. I don't feel like I have spare organs. My question is how is it that an experienced surgeon can make this kind of decision? Is this some kind of standard procedure? Do I have reasons to be seriously concerned about what happened. So far my calcium levels are normal, but should I watch out for certain things?Thank you!",
