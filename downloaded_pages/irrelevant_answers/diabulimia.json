            "answer": "Unfortunately, I think diabulimia has become more common. I am also a type 1 diabetic and am grateful every day that I have 16 years recovery from my own eating disorder, because I know I would have found this new way to abuse my body if I wasn't in recovery. You have an extra reason to get help. This is not something you can stop easily on your own. I strongly encourage you to get a referral to a therapist who has experience with eating disorders, preferably one who is knowledgeable about diabulimia. I'm sending you a PM with a website I'm on for diabetes and I have heard several people on there talk about past or current issues with diabulimia. But a website is no substitute for realtime help. I don't know you, but I don't want you to die, so please get help soon so you can enjoy the rest of your life.",

            "answer": "If you think you might have diabetes, you need to see your doctor right away and be tested. Type 1 diabetes can be diagnosed at any age from childhood up and is an autoimmune disease, meaning nothing you have done caused it.Please do not envy the weight loss of a person with diabulimia. If you re-read the OP's post, you will see that she is scared and wants help, not that she thinks it is a great way to lose weight. It is not, it's a great way to get very very sick. As well as checking for diabetes, you need to get help for your eating disorder before it gets worse. That is your illness talking that wants you to be so thin you can feel bones. Things will get much much worse for you if you don't get help. Please talk to your parents or other trusted adult and get the help so you can go on and enjoy your life.",
