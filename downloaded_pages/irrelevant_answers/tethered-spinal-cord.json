            "answer": "Pain from pushing on a spinous process is a cardinal sign for spine disease. If you have a job that requires standing on your feet all day, you are a candidate for low back pain and lumbar disease.The chances of carrying spina bifida occulta 25 years without discovery is low in our age of preventive medicine. Through all the various exams you've had in your life, chances are that this condition would have been felt. This is a birth defect -- an incomplete closure of the spinal canal or meningocele -- and is usually discovered by adolescence, if not in early childhood.Occulta is the most benign type of meningocele and does not cause disability, however, if you are concerned, ask your PCP for a referral to a neurosurgeon.As for your other symptoms, could they be related to your work? Standing on the feet all day makes anyone's legs hurt.Don't wish to minimize your problem, but first consider the simple solution in all things. Scientists call this principle Occam's Razor. It generally leads to the best answer to most problems.",

            "answer": "Hey thanks for responding! I know i am thinking too much about it but reading forums about spina bifida occulta/tethered spinal cord has really made me think. A lot of people didn't know they had that until they were in their 40s and 50s when they got an mri done for something else.\u00a0\u00a0Ive never had any kind of xray before but yes i am an xray tech so I'm on my feet all day long sometimes in the OR wearing lead so i know that is most likely the issue at hand. The other reason i worry so much about it is because of how much i go to the bathroom and it just increased within the last year. Also that my legs have ached and cramped ever since i can remember. .. at a very young age, however the pain has remained the same and has never gotten worse. I appreciate your response.",

However, there is one disease that you might wish to rule out, as it can be serious.Is there any pancreatic disease, aka, diabetes in your family?As a sexagenarian (I like that term -- it's so misleading! ), I'm used to having annual physical with blood work, EKG, chest xray (I smoked cigarettes 30 years ago), etc.As a health worker, have you had your annual physical?Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Hi and welcome to the Spinal Cord C/D forum.I know how frustrating it can be to have something but are not sure what it is, but you know your body and something is amiss ......There is testing to check your bladder...first you will record how\u00a0\u00a0much you are drinking, and putting out and in what time frame, if the specialists feel it is a large amount they will do a urodynamics testing to check the bladder.Not everyone with TCS will show obvious bowel issues...and may consider their bowel issues \"normal\" for those of us with congenital conditions since we have always had them we adjust and consider much of what is not normal, normal....As mentioned above, frequent urination can be due to several conditions and may not be TCS...but the dimples could indicate it....and many times is referred to as Occulta tethered cord...and this also means it may not show on a MRI.....But other things would crop up, such as mild scoliosis, lower back issues, leg issues, head aches...The headaches are from the constant pulling down on the cord and brain stem as a result another indication can be an elongated brain stem....BTW- I was DX'd with TCS when I was in my late 40's....I was also DX'd with Chiari Malformation and the 2 are related conditions and it is possible to have it and not really know....Look to your families medical history and see what your Dr has to say.....not everything that seems to fit symptom wise, can be found on line....but it is wise to educate yourself on conditions once you have a DX.Do keep us posted on what your Drs find out and how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hi Selma... thanks for your input I appreciate it. I have my annual physical Monday so I will definitely ask about that. Did you have leg aches as you were growing up?\u00a0\u00a0I have had them since i can remember.\u00a0\u00a0When i lay on a hard surface my sacrum area hurts especially when i raise my butt.\u00a0\u00a0I know it could just be something with my pelvis or SI joints possibly and unrelated to my spinal cord. My back hurts once in awhile also but i do lift at work and wear heavy lead. I drink a lot of coffee and caffeine so that may be my bladder issues. What symptoms did you experience growing up? Thanks so much! I am just wondering why the doctors never mentioned anything about my y shaped butt crack? Especially as a young child?",

I also have Chiari and EDS, so some of my symptoms may be related to them as well so I will not list everything.....Not sure about the crack issue, I do have a sacral dimple...and did have the cyst rupture....but am still holding off on having the\u00a0\u00a0cord de-tethered.",

            "answer": "I am sorry about your tethered cord. I wish you nothing but the best. Yeah I wonder if that may be related then with all of my years of leg aches/cramping. I have the two small indents right at the tip of my crack instead of one sacral dimple in the middle so I am not sure if that is the same thing or not. Or if it can be several different versions. I appreciate any feedback, it helps to be able to talk with someone.",

    "question": "I am 25 years old and have a y shape butt crack with two small dimples. i was researching and saw this is related to spina bifida occulta and I'm extremely worried. I've always had leg cramps/aches from my butt to my toes after being on my feet all day. It occurs in both legs at the same time or one or the other and only a hot bath stops the pain. could i have a tethered spinal cord?I have been urinating more frequently in the past year and even wake up in the middle of the night. I have no bowel issues. I do drink a lot during the day but i feel like this is not normal. i also have one spinous process in the middle of my back with poison when i push on it. Any advice? I do not get any numbness.",
