    "question": "my wonderful girlfriend is type 1. i'm still learning what that all means. curiously asking questions she tested my blood sugar and it was 160 4 hours after last meal. she freaked. i've been testing multiple times throughout the day now and she is very concerned that my levels are all over the place. 40 riding Harley, 144 after fasting, sudden drops, prolonged 'highs' and now is attributing my numb limbs and wrist issues to diabetes. i have to sleep with braces due to 15 years on a computer. numbness is from nerve damage from multiple sports injuries / surgeries. i'm a business owner so i don't have insurance. she's pressing me to go to the doctor but i won't go here in the US. i promised her that if 80% of the responses here say i should fly down to Costa Rica (JCI accredited hospital) to get proper, affordable testing, i will. and yes, she gets to come and we get to surf :) Seriously though, are her concerns valid? should I get tested and if so what test(s) should i get? THANK YOU!!!",
