    "question": "OK this is quite long winded but bear with me.\u00a0\u00a0I should say that I am seeing my GP for this and am waiting for a appointment to see an ENT Consultant but wanted some opinions.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 22 years old, female.\u00a0\u00a0No health problems or allergies but obese.Approximately 6 weeks ago I had the usual Winter sinus congestion that everyone gets, my ears were blocked and so was my nose.\u00a0\u00a0I went in the shower and felt faint, called for my Mum and after a few seconds I did actually faint and lose consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0For the next few weeks I was feeling really tired all the time, nauseated and getting bouts of dizziness so I basically spent weeks in bed.\u00a0\u00a0Due to being so inactive and hardly eating I ended up in hospital for 5 days with painful impacted constipation.\u00a0\u00a0Since coming home from the hospital I still feel like I need to sleep all the time, nauseated, dizzy and fainted a further 2 times with a few near misses.\u00a0\u00a0One faint was walking from the doctor's office to the car and the other was in the shower again.\u00a0\u00a0The near misses were cooking and doing my hair.I was throwing up quite a bit all last week but that has gone now and I can keep things down, I just feel nauseous. I still have a bit of a blocked nose which is a bit bloody.\u00a0\u00a0My ears don't hurt but one clicks when I chew sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0I also keep getting a recurring headache in the same place, it's the back left hand side of my skull kind of going into my neck.The constipation has gone but my bowel movements aren't quite back to normal as I still can't eat much so there isn't much and I am getting rectal bleeding every time I go from what I can only assume is a tear from the constipation.\u00a0\u00a0Another thing which may be important is that when I was in hospital my urine and blood was tested and I was found to have high glucose in both so it looks like I may have type 2 diabetes.So yes, quite a lot of information there.\u00a0\u00a0I still feel dreadful and have zero energy to do anything and haven't left the house in 5 weeks besides the hospital and GP's office.\u00a0\u00a0What do you think is going on?\u00a0\u00a0I really need to start feeling better soon.",
