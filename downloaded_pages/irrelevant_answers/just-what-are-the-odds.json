    "question": "I've read an awful lot of posts here (great, helpful site) about the odds of treatment with pegasys and ribavirin. My own Dr. quoted about a 50% success rate. But I've read here that genotype 1 is the hardest to get cleared. Does anyone know what the odds for success are for genotype 1? By the way, I do not know if I'm 1a or whatever. Only that I'm a 1.",
