            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is possible to feel tremors all over the body or feel shaky. Tremors or shakiness are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. You may also need to consult a sleep specialist.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Hope this helps. Take care!",
