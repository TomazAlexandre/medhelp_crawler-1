She said she told her doctor she was ready to have the baby the doctor said okay Haha. All doctors are different I'll be asking my doctor if I can be induced the day after I'm due since my first was indicted I figure if this one doesn't come then it will have to be forced too",

            "answer": "being induced is actually harder on the baby because the baby and your body can not work together since you are using artifical hormones to bring on labor. It increases chance or a c section, stress on the baby and in some cases infant death so make sure you look into the different types of drugs they can use to induce you and the side effects so you know what to ask for and what to refuse.",
