Your TSH does not indicate that you are hyper; however, your FT4 and many of your symptoms may indicate hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0You also have some symptoms that indicate type I diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Please post the reference range for the Free T4.The other thread from yesterday can be accessed via the following link:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Thyroid-Disorders/Thyroid-tests/show/2616995When you respond, it would be best to come back and respond on this thread vs starting a new thread each time you have a comment or question.",

I posted a comment with a link to this thread, so everyone wants to comment can follow the link and come to this thread, then we just stop posting on the other one, so it will move on down the page...Your TSH is actually toward the upper end of its range and your Free T4 is only at 34% of its range - both leaning toward hypothyroidism, not hyper.\u00a0\u00a0Rule of thumb (where most of us feel best) for FT4 is 50% of range, so you fall somewhat short.\u00a0\u00a0Many of your symptoms are also hypo, including the problems with your periods, dry, itching skin, neck and head pain, hoarse voice, impaired mental function, etc.What bothers me as much as those are the other symptoms that are very much like Type I diabetes - those include the weight loss, dizzy faint spells, becoming easily startled, slurred speech, muscle weakening, extreme thirst.\u00a0\u00a0Most important are the weight loss and extreme thirst...You need to get checked for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you've had a Metabolic Panel recently, it should have a fasting glucose on it... that should be < 100.\u00a0\u00a0You should also request a hemoglobin A1c test, which tells what your blood sugar levels have averaged over the past 3 months.For thyroid related tests, you need to insist on Free T4 and Free T3, along with the TSH.\u00a0\u00a0Free T3 is the hormone that's actually used by individual cells, so it's the most important of all.\u00a0\u00a0You should also have thyroid antibody tests to determine if you have Hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0The tests you need are Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOab) and Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb).You said you're low in Ferritin... are you supplementing iron to bring that back up?\u00a0\u00a0Iron is necessary for the metabolism of thyroid hormones, so even if you're producing enough hormones, without adequate iron, your body won't use them correctly.You said in the other thread that your B-12 is \"normal\"... often B-12 is in the normal range, but not high enough to alleviate symptoms... if you have the actual level, please post it.Have you had vitamin D tested?\u00a0\u00a0Like iron, Vitamin D is necessary for the metabolism of thyroid hormones, so even if you produce adequate amounts, your body won't use them correctly.\u00a0\u00a0 If you had vitamin D tested, I'd recommend you do so.",

            "answer": "Hi there, thanks so much for your time \u263aI had a fasting diabetes blood test - normal. Dont think ive had any other diabetes blood tests though. They checked sugar in my urine and have had lots of the finger prick tests. Normal, although With the latter my sugar myhas been low a few times.On one occasion when I collapsed the ambulance guy said if my glucose had been just one digit lower, he would be giving me glucose. And I had just had a meal. Its usually between 5 and 7 though. On my fasting blood test it was around 5.1. My mum is diabetic so we keep checking mine using her machine and its normally OK. I'm surprused its normal with the symptoms I have and the strong family history of diabetes.I think people assumed I would be hyperthyroid due to the weight loss, altho prior to becoming unwell I had been gaining weight & struggling to lose it even if I didn't eat. So to suddenly drop two clothes sizes was a shock especially as this was over Christmas when I was stuffing my face! I crave sugar a lot. My weight seems to have stopped declining now though but I should be the size of a house with what I eat.I am taking iron supplements for the ferritin. Maybe thats why my weight has now stopped declining.I'm gonna try & get those tests you suggest. I'm sure my Drs are tired of seeing me but I have no choice but to keep returning until they sort me out. When you have such widespread symptoms its tricky as my docs only seem to want to focus on one area at once.I have a copy of some blood tests my Dr did and B12 just says 'no action required' no value.Thanks again hope you are well,Mandy",

            "answer": "Ah - you just shed some light on the issue... if you were gaining weight, then started losing weight rapidly, but now you've stopped, you could very well have Hashimoto's and you started out hypo, with the weight gain, then you \"could\" have been hyper at the time you were losing... While Hashimoto's ultimately ends up with the patient hypo, it's quite common to have periods of hyper in the beginning stages.\u00a0\u00a0Those periods can last for a few weeks or a few months.\u00a0\u00a0They can alternate with periods of hypo or normal...You should also be aware that quite a few symptoms that many people think are exclusive to hyper can also apply to hypo, so we have to be careful when going by symptoms, alone.\u00a0\u00a0That's why we rely quite heavily on blood work, when certain symptoms are present.Be sure to get the 2 antibody tests I mentioned above... those will be the most telling as far as thyroid tests, but you also need the Free T3 and Free T4.It's good that you're supplementing with iron; that will help with, both, the energy issue, as well as the thyroid issue.I'm sorry, I don't trust any lab report for a B-12 that simply says \"no action required\"... it's not up to the lab to decide that.\u00a0\u00a0The range for B-12 is quite wide - usually from about 200-1100 and anything less than 500 is suspect, even though it's within the range.\u00a0\u00a0My lab even puts a note on the report saying that anything under 500 may present symptoms of deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Some countries have 500 as the bottom of their range... I'd insist on a number result, if I were you.As far as home tests - I don't have much confidence in the finger prick tests you're referring to, but there are online sites from which you can purchase your own tests, without a doctor's order, depending on where you live.\u00a0\u00a0You order the tests from the online site, pay for them with a credit card, the online site e-mails you a lab order and tells you what lab to go to in your area for the blood draw (from what I've seen, it's almost always LabCorp).\u00a0\u00a0You go get the blood draw, then in a couple of days, the online site e-mails you the results, which you can then take to your doctor for action - be sure to take only a copy and retain the original for your files in case you have to find a different doctor...There are several sites from which you can order labs on this basis... one I've used, myself is healthcheckusa and I've had real good luck with it.\u00a0\u00a0I think there may some less expensive ones, but I can't vouch for those as far as quality and service.I just took a look at healthcheckusa and for $80 you can get TSH, Free T3 and Free T4 and for another $90 you can get TgAb and TPOab.\u00a0\u00a0These are very reasonable and easy to get, if you have a LabCorp within easy driving distance.A Vitamin Panel that includes Vitamin D, B-12 with folate and magnesium is $150, which I think is a bit much - vitamin B-12 and D might be better gotten from your doctor.",

    "question": "Hi,I've been rapidly decling for several months. When I first got sick it felt like hormone / thyroid related but after bring told my thyroid was normal I let it go.However many people keep telling me you can still have thyroid issues with normal results? Is this true?I paid for a comprehensive blood screen in March which included thyroid. My results then were:Free T4: 16.1TSH: 2.29People keep saying my symptoms are classic hyperthyroidism or maybe something wrong with my adrenals. Also that I should get T3 tested as hasn't been done?It bagan last summer with odd hip and foot pains, then really kicked of in Sept. I sudfenly became easily startled, hot flushes, dizzy / fainting spells, periods weird & all over tge place, slurred speech, neck and head pain,itching over my thyroid and pressure sometimes pain, hoarse voice, rapit weight loss, extreme thirst, hearing loss, facial & eye pain, extreme muscle weakness, increasing numbness in throat, arms, feet, tons of new moles & freckles & spots, itching burning type pains, severely impaired mental function, low mood. Its got so bad I've ended up being rushed to hospital by ambulance recentlty. They just ran basic bloods & found nothing. I keep being handed to neurology who have been useless in taking it seriously. I've had brain and spine MRI and lumbar puncture (but even had to fight to get those tests done) which were normal.People tell me untreated hyper thyroid can lead to neurological symptoms so I'm wondering if I should follow that path. It sounds silly but no Dr has followed my decline and taken control to do a diagnostic work up. So I'm having to try and help myself. The sicker I get the harder it is tho. Its destroyed my life ad I'm hardly able to do anything.I'm 37 and don't think it's menopause.If anyone has any suggestions please help. It seems you just can t rely on doctors anymore which is scary.Best wishes,Mandy",
