            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0Electric current like feeling can be due to side effects of certain medications. So if you are on any drug, ask your doctor and stop this drug and see if it helps. It can also be due to fibromyalgia, menopause, Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched nerve can also be the cause (in lower back, pudendal nerve entrapment or plateral femoral cutaneous nerve which comes from the hip area and gets pinched in a condition called meralgia paresthetica). Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility. Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.
