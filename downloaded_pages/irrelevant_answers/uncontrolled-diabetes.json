            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Does your friend check her blood glucose throughout the day? How are her numbers?\u00a0\u00a0If she has made the necessary dietary and lifestyle changes and is taking her insulin, she should be able to get her levels under control. If they are still out of control, then I would think a change of medication would be necessary.If she has not made dietary or lifestyle changes, and is relying on medication alone, she is going to continue to struggle. Her doctor would be a good resource for the changes that need to be made. Another resource for dietary changes would be a consultation with a dietician. The dietician could look at her current diet and exercise routine and suggest the necessary changes to maintain a health blood sugar and stabilize her weight.I hope this helps.Cathy",
