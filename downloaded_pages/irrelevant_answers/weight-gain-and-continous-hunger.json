If you do not have diabetes then this could be due to severe acidity which is causing hunger and the extra you eat is causing weight gain.The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Take care!",

I know I am overeating but cannot stop for some reason. I have tried to cheat my mind by drinking a lot of water and that has not helped either. There is a craving for something sweet after a meal. I have checked my thyroid levels and diabetis through multiple institutions but the results come out normal. My weight gain is leading to problems in my lifestyle. My knees pain like hell. I really do not know what to do with my limited resources.",
