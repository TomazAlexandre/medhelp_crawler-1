            "answer": "Although I cannot make an accurate diagnosis without personally examining you or reviewing your films, I tend to agree with your neurologist that your symptoms don't sound like ALS, MS or PD. With the history of the tick bite, I am concerned about all the possible tick-borne diseases which include LYme, Rocky Mt spotted fever, and ehrlichiosis, as well as others. I would consider getting a spinal tap to rule out a chronic meningitis picture that you could get with Lyme dz or other infections that are not picked up with blood work. Also, think about getting an infectious disease expert to take a look at you.Had you not had the tick bite, other things to consider would be new onset of diabetes or primary muscle problems. The diabetes could be ruled out with a glucose tolerance test or special blood studies. The muscle disorders could be evaluated with an EMG and possibly a muscle biopsy.I'm glad that all your studies have been normal so far. But I am concerned that you're losing weight and having on-going symptoms. It sounds like there's an infectious component to this. Talk to your docs about a spinal tap and getting an ID consult. Best of luck to you.",

            "answer": "I read your post with great interest because one specific symptoms the \"HOT FLASHES\" reference.I too have been experiencing very similar symptoms, tingling numbness extre thirst (and acompanying frequent urination) . My symptoms began after a trip to the caribbean back in April (nothing bit me!) waking up one morning with a totally numb fingertip on my left index and left big toe. Also a lot of heavyness on the back of my neck and sorta of a \"grinding\" sound when i moved my head up and down. I visted the doctor back then and he prescribed muscle relxers and and antiaxitey Rx. Gradually the symptoms subsided untill it was not more than a slight tingle every couple of days. Around July i began experiencing heavyness in my legs but it is totally random with no reproduceable cause (like it doesnt happen when i do something sopecific it just happens) also the HOT FLASHES. It typically starts with a more pronounced heavyness on my neck and then i feel the flash. Breathing VERY slowly (trying to avoid hypervetilating) sort of diminishes the duration of the flash.The night of the New York tragedy my body literally started jumping on its own while in bed an arm would just flare so would my feet etc. The next day I went to see the Dr. and stronger Paxil was prescribed along with sleeping aidsOn that visit I asked for a referal to a neurolgists but shie ordered a full battery of blood tests that showed nothing abnormal (no dibetis, thyroid , anemia, B-12 def etc) the only unusual finding was low Carbon Dioxide level in my blood which she claims doesnt bother her.She still feels that I have an extreme case of anxiety ( my life has indeed been extremely complicated since that trip to the caribean).I am going today for an MRI of my neck which is still bothering me not pain but heavyness and also the heaviness on my legs persist.",

    "question": "I am a 32 year old male and for the last 2 months I have been having muscle pain(back of thighs), tightness, twitching in legs arms and face, slight cramping, slight numbness in hands for a week with pain up arms, fatigue, hot flashes, can't sleep good(keep waking up and seem to be very thirsty) and I am now loosing a lot of weight. I have no muscle weakness(the weight loss seems to be loss of fat and I don't have much to spare)but do have a slight loss of coordination when grabbing things and walking(it is like my arms and legs are heavy). I had a CT and MRI and all kinds of blood work. Everything is normal including CPK,B12,thryiod and Lyme. Neurological exam was great, all reflexs good and no tounge flacalations.Two months ago I had a thorn in my little finger that became infected and had a red line going up my arm. 10 days of Keflex took care of that.\u00a0\u00a0I felt good for almost a week and then found a blood engorged tick on my leg.\u00a0\u00a0About a week later I started feeling pain that started in the arm that had the infection\u00a0\u00a0Dr. put me on Doxycycline for 14 days.\u00a0\u00a0The first night I took it I awoke a few hours later shaking like I had a fever but no tempature. That went away in about a half hour.\u00a0\u00a0Over he next three weeks this happened 2 other times.\u00a0\u00a0I would bundle up with a lot of blankets even though I was not cold and go back to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0The Neurologist says that I don't have ALS(I hope not) and probably not MS or Parkinsons. One Doctor thought I might have had Ehrlichiosis and this was the after effects.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone is stumped.Any thoughts would be appreciated.",
