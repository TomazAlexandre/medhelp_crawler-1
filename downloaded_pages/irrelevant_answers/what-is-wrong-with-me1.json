            "answer": "Hi Chris,I apologize for my delay in responding.You do have many symptoms of diabetes and a strong family history, so looking into this is a must.\u00a0\u00a0A fasting blood sugar usually will be adequate, especially if you are having all these symptoms, to diagnose diabetes, but it is not perfect. You have a few other options:1)ask your doctor to schedule an oral glucose tolerance test. You will have a fasting level drawn, drink a glucose-load, then have your glucose checked again. This is the second accepted way to diagnose diabetes.A Hemoglobin A1C is also used, but is not widely accepted as a good way to screen for diabetes. If it is 7%\u00a0\u00a0ofcourse, then you have diabetes.2)You can buy a meter and start checking you blood sugar on your own.I strongly suggest doing either or both of these soon to find out what is going on. If you do not have diabetes, then your doctor should look for other reasons why you feel so poorly(thyroid tests etc).Take care",

            "answer": "Your dr. need to do some more tests. for one a fasting blood sugar doesn't tell the hole story. Getting a A1C done will tell alot more. Do u have a blood glucose machine. U should get one and check your own Blood Sugars when u get up in the Am and two hrs after meals, and at bedtime. Your blood sugars could be goin to low also. Your Dr. needs to find out what is going on with u. But try getting the glucose machine and be your own dr for a few days and take the machine into the Dr. and show him. If it high or if its low. I'm betting u are dealing with Low blood sugars. U can also get some protein sticks, and some ketone sticks and some sticks to check for sugar in your urine at any drug store, I think this would be a good idea. The ketone sticks can tell if u are having Keteois problem and if so get to your Dr. Are u on a low carb diet, or other diet that made u loose all that weigfht. 100lbs how much did u weight before and now?\u00a0\u00a0Nightrider if your dad and brothers are diabetics, u have a high increased chance if they are type 2, less if your dad is type 1. Get better, u have me worried about u, please let us know what u do and what u find out ok, Debbie",

            "answer": "Chris think Debbie is right, you sound like you might have diabetes one, but as I am just another diabetic do not take my word for it, get your doctor to do more tests, losing weight as I understand it is one of the clues for diabetes one, but again do not use my opinion, I am not a doctor, so since you have relatives with diabetes you do stand a chance of getting it also, so please push your doctor to do more tests, and let us know how you make out, we all care.",
