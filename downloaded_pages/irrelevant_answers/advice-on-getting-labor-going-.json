My sister was told she was going to have a massive baby and they claimed that the ultrasounds proved that. She had gestational diabetes so they delivered at 37 weeks and a freaking squirrel popped out! I think my niece barely cleared 5 1/2 pounds. And as for me my drs, in different states BTW, each said that my kids were going to be tiny little things, maybe six pounds if I was lucky, and both my kids were 8 and a half pounds! I'm now pregnant with my third and I'm not even going to bother asking. My personal goal is for a 9 pounder though LOL. Trying to breed champions here! LOL",

She suggested (no joke) a glass of wine and really, really good sex to get labor going. She said the wine won't hurt the baby and the sex won't hurt either. But she said it had to be really good in order for it to work. Lol",
