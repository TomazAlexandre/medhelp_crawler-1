            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!With repeated infection, I am sure your diabetes status has been checked. Other than that it could be due to persistent infection. If you have been to tropical kind of climate, then malaria, schistosomiasis, Brucellosis and other worms in stool should also be ruled out. Kidney infection, genital tuberculosis, inflammatory bowel disease etc are some other causes that should be looked into. Dehydration is another cause of low grade fever so increase your fluid intake and see if it helps. In women, even polycystic ovary, menopause, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) should be investigated for.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks for getting back to me! Yes, my Diabetes has been checked & has been doing pretty well. I really do watch that. I had a complete hysterectomy about 5 1/2 years ago, so know that there can be none of those types of issues. I have really not had any intestinal types of issues; such as stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting, etc. I have had some nausea, in addition to the symptoms that I mentioned before. Like I said, I am just super exhausted, having these fevers, the shortness of breath & profuse sweating with that shortness of breath (which only happens when I am being active...which never happened before!!) . I know that my heart is fine, so I guess that I will pursue having the other things checked out, that you mentioned. I will call my PCP today. Thanks again for your help. I am just so tired of feeling sick!",

    "question": "I have been having low-grade fevers, running between 99-101, for 6 months now. This all started when I had a Cellulitis Infection in my lower leg, which ended up being a MRSA Staph Infection, back in March of this year. Then I got another Cellulitis Infection in April, which was said to be a Strep Infection. Both times I was hospitalized & given IV Antibiotics. But, ever since March, I have felt so exhausted, have had the low-grade fevers several times a week, headaches, joint pain, shortness of breath & profuse sweating with any amount of activity. I have had all kinds of blood tests, body scans, heart tests, MRI's, etc., and everything comes back as \"normal\". I have seen an Infectious Disease Dr., Cardiologist, Rheumatologist, Neurologist, and still have gotten no answers. I am still too sick to return to work, and yet have no Diagnosis. I am frustrated beyond measure! Some things that I have NOT had done are a Spinal Tap and a Stool Sample Analysis (to check for parasites, etc.) My husband & I were in Haiti, Jamaica, Grand Cayman, and Mexico just a few months prior to me getting sick; so I wonder if that would have anything to do with this? Any suggestions? I am feeling desperate!",
