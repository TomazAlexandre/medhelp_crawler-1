            "answer": "You should have her blood checked for TSH, free T4, Free T3, and anti-Thyroid anti-bodies.If you get the slightest incling your GP is indecisive or dismissive of the test results, seek out an Endocrinologist that specializes in treating Thyroid problems, not Diabetes.Somebody thinks she has Hashimoto's, and that should not be ignored. It is treatable, but if she has Thyroid disease, it will impact her health to some degree for life. The sooner a diagnosis is made and treatment begins, the sooner she will benefit.",

            "answer": "Well, don't panic.It's not cancer. She will be fine.Hashimoto's is the most common form of thyroid disease. most people that are Hypothyroid have Hashimoto's. It is very treatable.There are various symptoms and complaints with Hashimoto's, and not everyone has them all. Weight gain is not always going to happen.Relax until you can talk to your doctor. Tell him you want a copy of the test results. In fact, call ahead and tell his secretary you want a copy.Listening to the doctor say this value is high and that result was low and then going home and trying to remember any of it is impossible. The test results will be something you will want to refer to if you are reading about the disease or trying to find an answer to a question.Best of luck to you both.",

    "question": "can you please tell me what my 8 yr old daughter ultra sound results on her thyroid means Imaging of the right lobe of thyroid measures 5.7cc in volume and the left 5cc. This size does appear quite enlarged for an 8 year old girl. There is a increased echotexture to the thyroid gland with no discrete nodules but heterogeneous bilaterally. No significant finding is also marked increased vascularity in both lobes. No focal lesion is seen. Lymph nobes within the neck are slighty prominent bilaterally. They do appear to retain normal lymph node architecture. Findings are of symmetrical hypervascular enlarge thyroid most likely consistnet with auto immune or hashimotos thyroiditis.what does this mean for my daughter",
