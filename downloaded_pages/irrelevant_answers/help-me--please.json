            "answer": "You have a number of things going on. As you know it is IMPOSSIBLE to give a diagnosis over the internet. A first guess is that, based upon your weight and age, that the \"asthma\" might be due to diabetes. Yes, diabetes can mimic asthma. The first thing your doctor should have done is order a fasting glucose of insulin clamp procedure. Square one.\u00a0\u00a0Don't pass go. Don't collect two hundred dollars. The muscle twitching if often due to a calcium-channel problem. Drinking a few glasses of milk a day often ends the problem. Quine is often used to treat muscle spasms also.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't thing anyone is paying sufficient attention to your medical problems. The good news is, I think your symptoms are probably reversable.",

            "answer": "Caregiver222, thank you for taking the time to read my post and give your thoughts and suggestions. I'm not overweight at all, my BMI is very low and I work out frequently, so a lot of my weight is muscle. I was diagnosed with allergic asthma at age 5 and have been treated for it ever since. I will definitely take the milk suggestion and begin that, however, my concern is still the pressure at the base of neck that goes away when I pop my neck. I get really nervous like something is about to happen (especially when driving!). I'd also like to point out that I occasionally get dizzy, but I think everyone does. It never lasts more than a few seconds.",

            "answer": "Just to explain how the insulin utilization syndroms mimic asthma: When the insulin is used up the body goes into an alternate means to lower blood sugar. The alternate method commonly produces ketone bodies in the urine. This is an acidic process. The acidity inflames the alveoli. This in turn produces air hunger and mucus, mimicing asthma.",

            "answer": "The pressure at the neck is suggestive of a problem in osmolality. Also mediated by blood sugar. Diabetes is not a very helpful word. Insulin utilization syndromes are better at describing things. Sometimes you have to peel the onion one layer at a time. I would really check my blood sugars. You can do this yourself. And this may not in fact be your problem. You might be interested in knowing that people with chronic alergies have significantly lower rates of cancer. Having a hypersensitive immune system has advantages. :)",

            "answer": "What the hell?I swear I need to stop reading these forums - and I will, right after I respond to this. I'm an MD, and while MDs certainly don't know everything, I'd be surprised (very) if you ended up having diabetes or an insulin-utilization problem. Based on your age and weight? 125 lbs is NOT overweight, OK, and you don't need to explain that you're mostly muscle. I mean, what the F?Truthfully, I don't know what you have (other than allergies and asthma - and asthma alone makes people feel like someone's sitting on their chest), but consider you may well have several unrelated things going on - don't always assume that there's one big mystery illness that's responsible for all your symptoms.The neck problem doesn't sound like anything I've heard of, but certainly not a problem with osmolality. I'm really at a loss for what to say about Caregiver222's comments except that he/she has insulin-on-the-brainstem. This is so typical of these sites - ask 100 people and you'll get 100 people who KNOW what you have (1. Fibromyalgia, 2. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, 3. MS, 4. Lupus, 5. a \"candida\" problem, 6. a gluten allergy, 7. do I really need to go on)? Does this sound familiar? Oh, yes, and Lyme disease. Everyone has that these days, too.Look, I'm not trying to be sarcastic here - there ARE people with Lyme disease, and all the other things, too, but as Caregiver222 says, you can't diagnose people over the internet (said shortly before he/she basically DID diagnose you, curiously enough).I'd try sorting one thing out at a time - discuss the most worrisome symptoms with your doctor first - if you present a list of every small worrisome symptom you have (eg. transient dizziness) your doctor may see you as a hypochondriac or someone with an anxiety disorder - I'm not saying either of those things is true (though you do sound as though you have some anxiety) - just that if your doctor starts thinking along those lines, he/she won't be much help to you!I wish you luck and suggest you see someone other than your pulmonologist; doctors always look for something in their own line of specialty, and it sounds as though you really need to see a general practitioner or general internist to get things sorted out.Jr.PS. Diabetes can do a lot of things to the body, but unless you are in frank diabetic ketoacidosis with kussmaul's respirations, I doubt it will \"mimic\" asthma; I'm the first to admit doctors don't know everything, but we usually can tell the difference between diabetes and asthma.",

            "answer": "I'm not sure if you're calling ME arrogant, and if that's the case, I certainly didn't mean to come off that way. Plenty of people immediately assume you're arrogant if you're an MD, but if you knew me even slightly, you'd know that I'm the first person to say how little medical doctors know!I have no doubt that Caregiver222 may be a caring poster to the site; whether he is knowledgeable is debatable. I don't know what you do for a living, but I spend much of my day listening to patients panicking about far-out notions they've picked-up from the web. Now we have the latest poster, who thinks this sounds like multiple environmental sensitivities; again, a theory based entirely on this individual's own personal history.The danger is that Brittxbritt now thinks she knows what's going on, when nothing could be farther from the truth - the chances of her having diabetes based on the symptoms she listed, plus her age and weight, are remote. I'm not suggesting that anyone here is intentionally trying to mislead people, it's just that people get married to their theories, and will try to see these theories as responsible for nearly every symptom under the sun. Not only that, but he just declared a 5'4\" 125 lb woman overweight. If you don't think that's a dangerous thing to say to a young woman, you're dead wrong!I like knowledgeable information as much as the next person - the trick is in knowing what's real knowledge and what's not!Best,Jr.",

    "question": "I'll just get down to it. I'm a female, 20 yrs old, 5'4\" and 125lbs. I am diagnosed with asthma and allergies. My symptoms include: alternating diarrhea/constipation (although it's usually constipation), fatigue, muscle weakness, chronic upset stomach, chest pain, sometimes it feels like something is sitting on my chest (But no pain), and muscle twitching that is almost always in my legs. Also I'd say almost every day, I get this weird feeling, like pressure it building up at the back of my head and it will only go away if I pop my neck, which I hate doing. I also can only eat small portions before I get uncomfortably full and feel bloated.My pulmonologist attributes most of these symptoms to my new asthma medication, but when I tell him that I had these symptoms prior to the controller medication, he just tells me to wait a few weeks to see if they go away, but they don't. And he can't explain the muscle twitching. (Which if nothing else, is just slightly annoying.)Anyone out there, please shed some light and help me figure out what might be wrong with me...",
