            "answer": "Hi there,Here is my untrained thought:Numbness in your right toes and your right hand are Diabetes symptoms for full blown T2 called neuropathic complications. If you are not sure if you are already a T2 then, the\u00a0\u00a0most inexpensive and quickest way to find out if you are an T2, go buy a Diabetes self test kit called A1C NOW, made by Bayer, at Wal-mart or at Walsgreen for $29.99. Within 10 minutes after the test, you'll see the results.Or set up an appointment to see\u00a0\u00a0a neurologist., but not with an regular MD who in most cases know next to nothing about diabetes.Good luck",
