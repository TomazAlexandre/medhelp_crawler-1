            "answer": "I'm sorry you're having such a rough time, Michele. Unfortunately, it is not uncommon for people to struggle when they are first diagnosed, and to feel alone.You are not alone! There are many more of us who are, or were, in your situation. After I post this, I'm going to send you a private message with the name of a website where you will get support from literally thousands of other people with type 1.\u00a0\u00a0In case you are feeling old for type 1, don't: I was diagnosed at 58! Actually I was misdiagnosed Type 2 due to my age, so at least you know you are type 1!Here is my opinion: The mixed insulins are a very old form of treatment and not especially effective. My advise is to see an endo (or a different endo) and get put on the current standard of care which is long -acting insulin once or twice a day(called basal) and short acting insulin before meals, the dose determined by what you actually eat (called bolus). It is a much more effective way to manage your diabetes.There is a lot to learn, and feeling overwhelmed is natural. But with a better medical team and the support of the people I will send you, yes, it WILL get easier!Zoe",

            "answer": "oh, hugs.....are you really taking just 2 shots a day? no bolus dosing?your insulin needs to be adjusted if you are having so many lows (unless you are excersizing hard when, or before, they happen.i, too, am going to pm you a website address...wonder if its the same one...loland a book. after 5 years of being scared to death of my diabetes someone suggeted that i read \"think like a pancreas\" by gary scheiner. it changed my life completely. i am now a fearless type 1 diabetic!i, too, am a single mother of a young child.please test your sugars often......8-10 times a day....until you get your levels stabilized.",
