            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of ureteric colic,prostate problems like benign hyperplasia of the prostate(in males) or diabetes. Ureteric colic is defined as a medical condition characterized by the presence of a urinary stone, leading to urinary system pain.Polyuria (frequent urination)is a common feature of diabetes.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography ,prostate specific antigen blood test and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hello,Out of all the tests that I have mentioned,only kidney function tests,PSA and blood sugar tests require blood samples.Rest all do not require any blood samples.You can however get your blood sugar evaluated by urine examination.But still blood sugar levels and HbA1c are still better investigations.I hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",
