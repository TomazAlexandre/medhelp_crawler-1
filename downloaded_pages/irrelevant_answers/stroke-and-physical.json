            "answer": "Hi JerrySorry to hear about your stroke :(I'm not in the same situation as you as my job is mostly non physical.\u00a0\u00a0However my advice to you is to figure out what you can do without going overboard & definitely consider a staged return to work.I don't know how long ago your stroke was but fatigue is the one thing we all seem to have in common (although it usually gets less over time).\u00a0\u00a0Rest is how our brains heal so please make sure you give your brain time to heal between activities/time at work.HTHSue",
