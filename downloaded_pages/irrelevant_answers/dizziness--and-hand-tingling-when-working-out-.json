    "question": "While working out at my gym, I suddenly became very dizzy. I also felt nauseous. I began to sweat profusely(I never sweat while I lift). I also experienced strong numbness and tingling in my hands. I felt short of breath and nearly passed out. The episode passed in about 10 minutes. It was very real and very scary. Do you have any ideas?",
