Do u think steroids is worth trying? Or immuno suppressants? I also have a deep aching pain in my eye ever since I've had this condition. Any help or advice would be much appreciated.",

    "question": "I think I have a clearer understanding of my condition from speaking to the doctor again. He said there is a lack of blood supply to the preriphinal retina. Which needs laser photocogulation which I am getting tommorow.can anyone tell me if there is any other treatments for retinal Ischemia?What are the causes for retinal ischemia? what things should I get tested for? I really need to find answers this has been getting me really depressed. I have chronic fatigue syndrome on top of this eye condition and as a result don't have much quality of life. Before the eye condition I could at least read to pass the time. Now I can olny go on the internet for very short periods of time before my eyes become blurry and in unbearable pain.Any suggestions would be appreciated? I need a miracle i've been through so much. I don't know how much more I can take. I want some of my life back. I feel like i'm really disabled now and i'm only 27 I would love to go back to finish my degree someday.Thanks for reading.Neil.",
