            "answer": "I think you should go see a pdoc for sure.Bipolar isn't really something you can 'power through', if you know what I mean. People hear 'mental illness' and they think with the power of their mind, they can overcome it.The truth is, bipolar is a medical condition just as much as diabetes. You need your meds to keep your body balanced like other people's naturally are. Your brain is not capable of being 'normal' just by willing it to be that way... it's just not. Just like you wouldn't decide to power through diabetes, it's not a good idea to neglect your illness.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with extreme depressive bipolar disorder. I'm tired ALL the time. i seriously think i could sleep for days if someone would let me. I stopped taking all medications about 2 years ago. As soon as i stopped my grades shot up and i was doing pretty good, but now with all the stress i have going with my family and my grades are dropping I'm on edge 24/7 . I mean someone says the wrong thing or i feel as if someone is constantly ganging up on me I'm a ticking bomb and when i go off it's horrible and usually ends with me hyperventalating and being kicked out because i can get rather violent. i've been doing better with the anger side , but i just feel the onset of a severe low. However, I think i need help, but kinda want to face it on my own and learn to cope with my own mind. I'm just not sure if that will end with harming myself or people around me. I'm just really confused and like i said really on edge and the funny thing is i used to not be able to tell when i was on the brink of going off, but now i know it's just a matter of time before someone strikes a match and im really anxious and scared becasue once the fuse is lit it's so short there is no putting it out. i've tried talking to school guidance counsolers, but i feel better then and then i leave and reality strikes and im back. i'm just sorta tired of this feeling and i don't quite know what i should do or what would be best for me to do.",
