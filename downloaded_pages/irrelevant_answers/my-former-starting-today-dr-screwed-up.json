            "answer": "You don't need money to contact a lawyer. Call one tell them your story. Many lawyers will decide if you have a case and take out their payment from a settlement received or or a judgement received. If they lose they won't charge\u00a0\u00a0(not all of them so ask around).I am sorry you are going through this. I would be unbelievably upset by this too.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately, unless there is irreparable damage most lawyers won't take the case. If you haven't been hurt and your baby seems fine, you are going to spin your wheels. Definately report the doctor to the hospital board and document any conversations you have with them. Dates, times, names. Go so far as having them spell it.",

    "question": "Here is the situation:end of September, I did my one hour glucose test and blood work. My next prenatal appt, my dr said I was not anemic or have diabetes so my husband and I were relieved. I am currently 25 weeks and went to my prenatal appt today only to find out that I had a 3 hour glucose test in my file since October and my glucose test was really high!! I had to explain to the nurse 3x that I never knew I had that do that test and I was told I was \"healthy\"! My husband even had to confirm my story! Luckily today I had a different dr... she rechecked my file and told me to report my now further doctor. Out of fear I re-asked all my concerns/questions. By the end of my appt, I was diagnose with gestational diabetes, a possible hernia, and having more tests done during my next ultrasound... I honestly don't know how to go about this. I want to seek a lawyer but no money and don't even know if this is a case",
