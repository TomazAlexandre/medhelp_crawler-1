            "answer": "Hi JewelI am a Type 1 diabetic who has fifteen years recovery from an eating disorder and was grateful for every day of that recovery when I was diagnosed with diabetes 2 years ago. It is a rough combination. I strongly encourage you to get treatment for your eating disorder so that you can manage your diabetes and live your life. Lying to your doctor doesn't help you. Tell him/her the truth and ask for a referral to a therapist who has experience with eating disorder. If you are at all close to a large diabetes facility (such as Joslin in Boston) they might have someone on staff who has experience with both. Another option is to go to OA which has meetings in all larger towns and is a good source of support. If you go to several different meetings and share your situation you might even find someone with diabetes as well who can sponsor you (give you individual support). I'm really glad you posted here and hope you get some help because it's hard to get recovery alone, but it's worth it when you do get it! I'm sending you a private message with a couple sites to check out.",

            "answer": "I haven't lied to my doctor. I am too embarassed to tell the full story about how I am losing wt. with him. I am seeing a therapist and psychiatrist that know the whole story so I am getting help. This is not a large town and there is no OA meetings. The large hospital here - Scott and White also does not have group therapies which is disappointing. Thanks.Jewel1953",

    "question": "I am diabetic and wanted to take off some weight to see if I could get my sugars low enough to where I wouldn't have to take 1000 mg. of Metformin a day. I started using laxatives to lose wt. faster and it has lead into an obsession which I can't control now. My doctor thinks I am only doing extremely low calories which I am but doesn't know the other. I have tried to stop but can't. My doctor said that I am making my body work so much harder that I should be more worried about a heart attack with all my organs overworking for little eating plus the laxatives.",
