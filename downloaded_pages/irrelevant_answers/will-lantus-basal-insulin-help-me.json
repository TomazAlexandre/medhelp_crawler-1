            "answer": "A detailed answer is not possible on an internet chat board. Lantus is a terrific drug, and I am disappointed your primary care physician has not seen fit to provide you with more detailed guidance.I urge you to find a diabetic clinic with a nurse-practicioner and a dietician who will work with you on a daily basis for a while, then a weekly basis to insure you know how and when to administer Lantus.",

            "answer": "Hello,Your night time dose of lantus does need to be increased (typically increase is by 1 - 2 units every 3 days) until your target fasting blood sugar the next day is reached.\u00a0\u00a0However, this should be done under supervision of a doctor or diabetes educator.You need to find a new doctor who will help you adjust your insulin appropriately.\u00a0\u00a0You also need to read up on diabetes and it's management.\u00a0\u00a0Recommend the book \"think like a pancreas' or \"using insulin\".What is your a1c?\u00a0\u00a0target is < 7.0 or even better < 6.5.\u00a0\u00a0(people with excellent control may be able to achieve a1c in the 5s, without lows if they follow basal-bolus dosing approach combined with low carb eating).",
