            "answer": "Hi!The sensations of pins and tingling (needles) or paresthesia are generally due to peripheral neuropathies or vascular pathologies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies like deep vein thrombosis have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. There are several causes for peripheral neuropathies including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Nerve conduction studies should be done along with blood tests for above mentioned disorders. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis is another possibility but less likely in your case.Hypothyroidism, liver and kidney problem and diabetes can also cause loss of appetite. Often such disorders linger in the body without a person\u2019s knowledge and rigger in times of stress. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Hey thank you so much I really appreciate it. Yeah I've been suffering for like 6 months with this and I also get twitches all over my body. I just don't know why I have no appetite and other symptoms as well.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it's something fixable and not something ill have forever. My feet and hands won't stop burning and idk what to do to make them feel better. I hope it's not some type of std I tested negative for all of them but I'm worried the tests could be wrong because I had what looked like a herpes lesion but I just had a blood test that was negative but then I heard that herpes can cause neurapathy. Alot of the discomfort is on my pelvic area, lower back and hips that was my first symptoms and than other stuff started to happen over time. Anther symptom is that my skin is very sensitive to everything. Like I get marks all over my skin if it touches anything. I'm just worried and hope the doctors can give me some answers because they aren't finding anything wrong. All my bloodwork is always normal idk what that rules out. Thank you DR I appreciate your replies I've been a nervous wreck about these symptoms. Blurred vision is annoying and I just want to be back in good health. Thanks! Any advice I'd appreciate!",
