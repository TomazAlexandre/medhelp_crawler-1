            "answer": "Hello,With tinnitus sounds heard by the sufferer may range from metallic ringing, buzzing to thumping and loud noises.It can be due to noise pollution through out the day, ear wax, fluid, infection, or disease of the middle ear bones or ear drum, advancing age, diseases of the inner ear, damage to the nerve in the inner ear, some medicines like aspirin and sometimes aneurysm or an acoustic tumor.Exactly what is causing such symptoms in your case can be confirmed only after ENT examination, auditory brain stem response (ABR), a computerized test of the hearing nerves and brain pathways and CT/MRI brain. I would suggest you to consult an ENT specialist for that. I hope it helps.Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The various causes of tinnitus have been enumerated for you along with diagnostic procedures. Yes, an ENT examination is a must if you have not already had one.Since you notice progressive worsening of tinnitus along of thinning of hair, the two conditions could be related. Tinnitus along with hair loss is commonly seen in fungal infection of both scalp and ear (external canal). Diabetes too can result in both as also several forms of allergies that can affect both scalp and ear. Stress is also a contributing factor to hair loss and worsening of tinnitus. Do discuss these possibilities with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
