            "answer": "I don't know about him telling you to take of the sexy lacy thing and change into a shirt and hat. Not sure about that, but the anal thing dosen't mean he's gay. If you don't like it don't do it just for him. Offer to take the pill so he can ejaculate inside you. The erection thing is or isn't linked to him being gay either. I like to ejaculate in my wife I hate condoms and pulling out. We use the pill. She won't let me do anal though. There are a couple of reasons why the erection problems would be happening1. Physiological\u00a0\u00a0(hormones, heart, blood, damage to penis, diabetes.....)2. Psychological (performance anxiety, depression, guilt.......)3. He's gay4. He's cheating (only if there is reason to suspect this, erection problems alone are not enough to suspect this)If he gets morning wood, erections at night and can masturbate more than likely it is not a physical cause. Good luck you sound like a good girlfriend. I hope he knows how much you care.",

            "answer": "The situation is pretty much covered by what john911 already said. Without more evidence there is no way to tell if your boyfriend is homosexual or not. But it does not seems to be. Keep an eye on him, just in case.I would like only to add a few words about anal contact. Many men like it because: (1) it has something of the forbidden in it; (2) it makes internal ejaculation possible without precautions, although I am not sure that it is 100% safe; (3) this kind of contact is more pleasureable for some men because of more friction over the glans.Personally I find the anal region too much sensitive for such things and I understand anyone refusing to do it. If done, special care must be taken to avoid tissue damage. If you don't feel ready or willing to do it, just don't do it. It's that simple, and find something else for \"playing\".",

    "question": "My boyfriend has said and done some things, and I don't know how normal they are. We've been together for a year and a few of the odd things I've noticed/he's done are:-He's not much into feminine looking clothing. I mean, he loves breasts, but he says feminine clothing is overdone and that he likes to see me in simple things like T-shirts or wife beaters, and that he likes the \"skater girl\" look. He also says he thinks I look really good in hats-the other night when we were messing around I was dressed in a feminine lacy sort of thing, but he had me put on one of his white T shirts and tie it around my midriff, and he had me wear one of his baseball caps (which is when he mentioned he liked the skater girl look-He's told me a few times that he likes the \"tough girl\" sort of look, which obviously isn't that feminine-last but DEFINETLY not least is he likes doing anal. Now I'm not opposed to try new things, and all that other stuff hadn't happened I wouldn't be so suspicious, but all of it combined seems to be adding up to a really bad picture...to be fair, he said the reason he likes anal is because he can ejaculate inside me at least somewhere without the risk of me becoming pregnant. And I did ask him if he had the choice and there was no risk, would he rather ejaculate with anal, or ejaculate inside me the regular way and he said the regular way. So any opinions on if he has homosexual tendencies?",
