            "answer": "Chances are that since you are 18, this is a psychological issue. You may be worried about your sexuality and fear may be operating subconsciously as well as consciously. The more you worry, the more your penis doesn't behave.But you may stil worry that this is biological. So to be thourough- go see a doctor and get an examination. They have ways of seeing what the blood flow is into the penis and the shape of your veins etc... Most likely they will find that your plumbing is fine- and they might check your hormonal system as well.\u00a0\u00a0Once you get that check up\u00a0\u00a0you will know if you need a medical solution or not.Assuming, because it's most likely, that your problem is psychological, you need to relax your fears and wait until your body starts to respond again. It has nothing to do with masturbation- masturbation is just a personal, manual way of getting excited and it cannot hurt erection capability. My guess is guilt of some sort is interferring with your ability to have an erection.If you just wait for it to come back and be it's old self- it probably will. But if it hasn't- go see a urologist or proctologist and perhaps an endocrinologist or a general practice doc who can order these kinds of tests. If, as I mentioned, all is well, then go see a psychologist who has a practice treating sexual matters.\u00a0\u00a0He or she might even prescribe Viagra - just to show you all your plumbing can work again--all you need to do is get over what ever psychological blocks you are having.",

            "answer": "yea ive tried porn and stuff. I've been doing that for a whileIt makes me think that maybe im just not into it anymore.I'll feel horny, but when I put porn on I watch but i just dont feel like im really focusing on itI'm hoping thats the case and this just passes by but I've had this problem for months. I should have a girlfriend soon, I guess then is the only time ill find out if theres a real problem",

            "answer": "My recommendation to you would not be porn or movies- rather, I would go see a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0They may want to do blood tests for diabetes if you have other symptoms pointing towards that.\u00a0\u00a0There are also things that can cause this, such as lower testostrone levels or an underactive thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Also, do you eat healthy and get enough exercise?\u00a0\u00a0One other thing you can try is if you drink a lot of pop- cut back!\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing wrong with being a virgin at 18- you should be proud!\u00a0\u00a0Not many can say that these days!\u00a0\u00a0Let us know what you find out :)",

            "answer": "Im am proud im still a virgin haha. I was just listing that thinking it may be relevant to why porn may not be doing it for me anymore?I went to the doctor the other day about another problem I was having and i froze up when I was going to tell him about this. Idk why. I think I may have to go back though cause I did get a urine test about a UTI. I hope so because this time I am gonna make myself tell him.If not I am gonna look for a specialist in my area. Im trying to keep this away from my parents though.I very rarely drink soda. I do exercise pretty often, usually im at the gym everyday of the week. I haven't been doing cardio but I'm starting a new thing where I run to the gym everyday and run back which is a good 2 mile or so run.I had gone for a blood test before and they said I did not have diabetes",

            "answer": "I had the diabetes test a few months ago, this was after i started having the problem.It hasn't happened only once, everytime i get an erection they are subpar and It had been going on for a while, but I thought it was just a phase but im gonna say 5+ months of this. It wasn't always like this I use to be fine. This is why I think i have a problem.A while back one day i couldn't get an erection at all. Then the 3 days after that I was suddenly back to 100% and I felt awesome then they're back to being subpar. I read some sites on ED, and I really hoped that wasn't it. Most of them, however, described the things that I am going through so now thats plugged into my mind.I have read up on strengthening that muscle. I believe its called the PC or BC muscle. I have started working on it, but obviously I cannot expect immediate results.Its been worse the last few days.I guess ill just have to make another doctor's appointment and tell him. Feeling uncomfortable for 5 minutes has got to be better than the the stress this puts you under.",

    "question": "For a while now I have been having some erection problemsWhen i get to 100% erected im really not that hard anymore it feels more like 70% and after i ejaculate it doesn't stay up at all really.I use to be fine and would always be good when i was at 100% but now I dont know whats happenedI also no longer get morning erections and I use to have them oftenI am only 18 and this is very much effecting me mentally.I'm a virgin still, I sometimes think maybe masterbation just doesn't do it for me anymore. But then I think, if thats not the case and I go and have sex, I'll look like an idiot.Can someone please tell me what i should do about this? Or maybe what my problem may be/ ways i can test myself?",
