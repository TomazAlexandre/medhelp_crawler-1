            "answer": "There are lots of things that could cause this.\u00a0\u00a0The only way to tell for sure would be to make an appointment with your doctor and have him diagnose it after discussing your own history and your family history with him.Numbness is possible if you have suffered from cold sores frequently during your adult life, diabetes is another possible cause, and tingling of the lips and jaw area is even possible with cardiac-related problems, so it's probably pretty important that you discuss it with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0If you find out that it IS related to shaving your mustache after having one for so many years, it would be better to find out that it was something very minor such as that from your doctor than to find out the hard way that it's because you have blockage in an artery or something equally as dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0Please let us know what you find out.Ghilly",
