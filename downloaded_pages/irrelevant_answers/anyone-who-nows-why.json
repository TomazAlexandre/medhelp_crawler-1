            "answer": "I agree with xtragr8ful. It can also just be your hormones. I also started my period young and I had a lot of problems with it for the first 3 years. I finally went to a gynecologist and got everything straightened out. You would probably be more comfortable with a female gynecologist, I was, and if you go you can also ask them any questions that you may have that can be too embarrassing to ask anyone else. Best of luck to you.Sissie",
