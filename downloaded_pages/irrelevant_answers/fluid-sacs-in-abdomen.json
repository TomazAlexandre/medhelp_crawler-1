            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!In all probability you have a bloated abdomen. You could be suffering from an inflammatory bowel condition such as Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Other than that it could be due to H pylori infection. It can also be food intolerance. Diabetes can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Constipation can also cause bloating. Very sedentary lifestyle is another cause. Cancers of the gut and in female ovarian cancer too could be a cause.The fluid could be water collection due to poor gut movement. Please discuss with your doctor. Also get a complete gynecological examination along with hormones related to menopause. Take care!",

(thank god)As far as I know there are still 2 sacs of fluid in abdomen.Tomorrow I go for a pelvic scan.Then next day I see my doctor, who is finally back from 2 weeks\u00a0\u00a0off.So we'll see what\u00a0\u00a0comes from that.My abdomen seems to change from very hard\u00a0\u00a0to almost normal.\u00a0\u00a0And in between.Also can be in upper abdomen ( just under breasts) for a couple days,\u00a0\u00a0then can bein the lowest part of abdomen.Can you\u00a0\u00a0suggest anything be done differently?
