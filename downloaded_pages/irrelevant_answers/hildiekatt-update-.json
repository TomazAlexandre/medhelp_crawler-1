            "answer": "Hi Piparskeggr,We have a nine year old male ginger cat called Sammy. We adopted Sammy about three years ago from a cat rescue organization.When we adopted Sammy, he weighed 20 lbs. and our vet used to describe him as obese. Our vet advised us to feed Sam a caloriereduced diet. Here's the thing. He was losing about a lb a month which is a lot for a cat. This went on for a couple of months. Our vet agreed that Sam was losing too much weight too fast. Anyway, our vet decided to give Sam a blood test where it was discovered that Sam had diabetes.Sam had diabetes for almost a year. The vet gave Sam a number of fructosamine tests to determine how many units of insulin to give him.Like your cat, Sam eventually was down to one unit of insulin a day.Our vet told us then that there are some cats that stop being diabetic and that she had a feeling that Sammy might be one of these cats.Well the reason I am sharing this story with you is because Sammy is no longer diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Sammy now eats Medi cal calorie reduced food ( not canned food though) and only a certain amount which has been determined by our vet.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps this is what has happened to your cat.Sammy has been diabetes free for over a year now. No more needles and no more insulin. Sammy is now 16 lbs. and very healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you and your cat the best.\u00a0\u00a0 Eve",
