            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Dry skin usually results from environmental factors that you can wholly or partially control. These include hot or cold weather with low humidity levels, long-term use of air conditioning or central heating, and washing or bathing too much.Other conditions cause itchy skin as well. Skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis,lice,scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Let's take it up a notch...I drink plenty of water and have never had a dry skin problem. This is UNDER the skin...the itch is UNDER the skin but forms red blotches if I do not take an antihistamine. Can we go from there and get a true diagnosis?",

    "question": "for the past 15 years I have had to take 1 10mg Zertec everyday due to a condition in which, under my skin, anywhere I have hair, or in between my fingers & toes, up my arms, I will become red and itch. No rash from this. Taking the Zertec seems to keep it under control. I was told my body is releaseing too much histamine. could this be true?",
