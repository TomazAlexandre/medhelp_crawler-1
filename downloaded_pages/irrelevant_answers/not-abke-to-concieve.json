            "answer": "If you've only been trying for three months, there's really no need to worry! It can take a normal, healthy couple up to a year to conceive.As for the funny urine smell...could it be something you're eating? I know asparagus, for example, can change the way urine smells. Also, maybe it's just very concentrated. Try to increase your water intake and see if that helps.I agree with your mom...if it was a urinary tract infection you would definitely know! However, I guess there could possibly be other infections, or like ladybug said, conditions like diabetes. It probably wouldn't hurt to set up an appointment with your doctor and see what he/she says.Good luck!",
