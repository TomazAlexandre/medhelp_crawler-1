            "answer": "i would personally see a different doctor, he sounds really unprofessional. You should be receiving the best of care, plus extra due to your last pregnancy. Have it out with him, if there is no outcome, see a different doctor. i dont know how it works where you live, im from ireland but i'd definately not be happy. best of luck :)",

            "answer": "I would go to someone else, have you had your diabetes test? You should of had a pap test done to test for group b strep, and any sti, or infections, usually the dr after 12 weeks starts making you go for blood tests and urine tests as well. I know mine does. I also get a u/s around 20 weeks too. and one at 12 weeks as well. I would defiantly be looking for someone else who cares about you and your pregnancy, specially if you had complications your last pregnancy. Also your baby wont be to big to find out the sex. I was 33 weeks when i found out what my son was lol.. so i wouldn't worry to much about that",

            "answer": "Agree with the others, go somewhere else. What is your OB motivation to wait for so long? You SUPPOSE to have an u/s at 20 weeks where they check all the organs of the baby! Did you have one done at 13 weeks? THat one is mandatory....if not, than your doctor is a joke and you should switch and go for u/s right a way with a different doc!",

You have a history that puts you in a high risk category so should be monitored a little more closely2). You were told twice you would get an US and didn't.\u00a0\u00a0How incredibly disappointing and without good explanation.",

I am on medicade so I know there isn't a limit on the number of US or blood work a doctor can perform. I kept giving him a chance but my unborn child deserves more than that plus I alreadu have two beautiful daughters i need to be well for. So thanks again I will let you know what happens!",

            "answer": "oh wow; for sure go to another OB. that is ridiculous. it is recommended ALL pregnant women receive an ultrasound at 20 weeks to check for birth defects, genetic diseases, proper development, etc.. i can't believe he wouldn't give you one. its not just to check the sex of the baby. also you should be offered a blood test to screen for some of the genetic problems between....i think ... 16-20 weeks. def def def see another OB. and tell that one you will be leaving his practice.typically gestational diabetics isn't a concern until 28 weeks; hence why they test then. but i wouldn't doubt it if this OB didn't test you.",

Routinely you should have had an ultrasound around 8 weeks to date the pregnancy, and then if all was fine at all the follow up appointments then you should have had one between 18-22 weeks for an anatomy screening and at that point they could have told you the sex of the baby.... I would really consider changing.",

Thanks again everyone and I know for sure it isn't my insurance for those of you that want to know, I am on state funded medicad and it covers numerous labs and ultrasounds up until two months after birth.

With your history I'm sure getting multiple sonograms would be valid for being covered under MC+.So good luck finding a new OB! I would suggest using the site ratemds because other patients have rated them. I would also highly recommend finding a midwife in your area or at least a practice that works with certified nurse midwives (CNMs).",

    "question": "I'm currenty 23 weeks pregnant and have been to my dr 6 times. I was expecting an ultrasound to determine the sex of my baby on my 19 week visit but my Dr wanted to wait 4 more weeks. I was fine with it until I went to myappointment yesterday. I was expecting my ultrasound and he told me he wanted to wait 4 more weeks! what's the deal? I haven't had any tests done on me and only had my blood drawn once when I was 8 weeks. Should I be worried ? I have a history of gestational diabetes and had seizures with my last pregnancy. I thought my OB would keep a more watchful eye on this one but nothing so far. I am living in another state than where I had my 2 daughters so this OB is new to me. Should I trust him or go somewhere else?\u00a0\u00a0feel he isn't paying much attention to my pregnancy. I am also scared that the baby will be too big to find out the sex if I keep waiting, Any suggestions on what I can do to receive my ultrasound?",
