            "answer": "Hello Everyone, and Shwetamayank,the blood sugar numbers in pregnancy are must more stringent than in non-pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0They look for fasting blood sugar of less than 95, and in the glucose tolerance test they want to see numbers below 130 (latest guidelines just released).\u00a0\u00a0They also want to see that your fasting is < 95 all the time (ideally in the 80s, my doctor targeted 85), and post eating < 120, and never above 140.\u00a0\u00a0This is to give best outcome for mother and baby.Your numbers indicate gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However, the good thing is that your numbers are only slightly elevated.\u00a0\u00a0This means that most likely you can manage this with exercise and diet.\u00a0\u00a0The bad thing though, is that blood sugars will continue to rise during the pregnancy due to increasing insulin resistance, and do need to be carefully controlled.If are not already doing this, please start walking (or stationary bike), or swimming, or other aerobic exercise at a minimum of 30 minutes, twice day.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally you would walk (or other exercise) at least 30 minutes after each meal.You also need to avoid fruit juices, any sweetened drinks, sweetened foods.\u00a0\u00a0You should avoid cakes and candies.\u00a0\u00a0Carbohydrates such as whole grain breads, brown rice, brown past, potatoes can still be eaten (if they don't have too much effect on blood sugar), but only in small portions (ie. 1/2 cup, 1 slice etc per meal).\u00a0\u00a0Fruits should also be eaten in small quantities as they also contain lots of sugar.You should eat plenty of good proteins (eggs, fish, meat, nuts), and heaps of veges of all types.\u00a0\u00a0Non-sweetened dairy ok.I hope you can get a blood sugar meter to monitor your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0if you use the meter then you will find out which foods raise your blood sugar and which don't, and then you can adjust your diet accordingly.hope this is helpful for you.\u00a0\u00a0Please do ask any further questions you have.",
