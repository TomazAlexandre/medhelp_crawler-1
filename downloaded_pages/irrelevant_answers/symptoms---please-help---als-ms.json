            "answer": "Hi.It would be premature to ascertain whether your symptoms are associated with multiple sclerosis or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Tingling and numbness can occur in other conditions such as endocrine disorders, diabetes, stress, and vitamin and mineral deficiencies.You should talk to your doctor about these other possibilities so that a complete evaluation of your condition would be performed.Good luck.",

    "question": "I had a series of neuro tests earlier this year that were inconclusive.\u00a0\u00a0I had facial tingling, left arm pain, tingling in left hand fingers, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Also being treated by medication for arythmia and high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0About three weeks ago started getting twitches - first in left arm and then regularly in left calf, thigh, etc. Now get some as well in right leg and other various area of both arms.\u00a0\u00a0Just very random.\u00a0\u00a0Get them consistently and often at night or sitting at my desk. Also today feels like left side of my tongue and lips are a bit numb.\u00a0\u00a0I also notice on my tongue this morning where some skin about the size of a time had come off on same side as my numbing symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not tired, or tripping, dropping things, etc.I have a lot of stiffness in my upper neck.\u00a0\u00a0Had EEG, MRIs earlier this year that showed nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that ALS or MS could have been missed and has now developed.\u00a0\u00a0FYI was in roll-over car accident 7 years ago that broke several ribs and collar bone on left side.\u00a0\u00a0Thinking it could be damage related to that.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going back to my neurologist but from what I've read on line this sounds like it could be ALS, maybe MS?",
