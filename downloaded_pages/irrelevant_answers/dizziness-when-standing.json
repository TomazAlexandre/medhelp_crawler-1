            "answer": "Needless to say you require a good in-person evaluation by an M.D. who takes his time. In addition you need a work-up/consult with both an endochronologist and an opthamalogical neurologist.Square one is to get an HBA1c. Rule out diabetes. The shaking and fatigue are consistent with this diagnosis as well as the double vision.You need bloodwork to include a hermatocrit.There may be a neurological componant.The ER is not the proper place to get an evaluation.I don't know what is wrong with you, but I do believe that \"anxiety\" is not the problem. I believe you have an underlying undiagnosed medical problem that is causing the anxiety.It's hard to find a good primary care physician, but that's what I would recommend.",

I almost had a job but then this hit me like a brick.

But I believe the 113 was during an almost panic attack and the 45 was the orthostatic test thing when I was standing.I don't have the money to replace my glasses and I used to go on daily walks every hour but now I can't even stand up for very long.The anxiety coping tips would be great too, just to have even.",

    "question": "Over the past couple of months it's progressively gotten worse. From joking about it to now being afraid and even dizzy while I'm laying down. I can't sit in my chair anymore. I spend a lot of time on the computer and don't have glasses for my astigmatism anymore. lately I've been having chest pains and I've also been burping constantly. Food, no food. Just a lot of belching.I also get shaky. So I can't go for walks which is the only relieving thing here because my family blows.\u00a0\u00a0There's a ringing in my ears that goes a long with my heartbeat. And sometimes it's just my heartbeat itself.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the ER saturday and told them all about this. They did an orthostatic hypotension test. The one where you lay down, sit, and standup and they take your blood pressure during each. I forget the results because that entire day was panic.\u00a0\u00a0But apparently it wasn't good enough to not label my diagnosis anything but \"Anxiety\".I know this is a lot more than my question but I just don't get it. I have double vision as well. Could some of this be anxiety and the rest of it be related to staring at a computer screen 8+ hours a day without glasses bringing about eyestrain and CVS? It still doesn't explain the shaking or burping...",
