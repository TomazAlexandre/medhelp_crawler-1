            "answer": "Good grief. They never cease to amaze me in their utter lack of organization, their incompetence, and way too many other things to note.Like you, I know that vets are irate for many good reasons and that saddens me. I cannot believe they changed their mind about your wrist. Or maybe I can. Either way it is messed up how they continue to treat you and why can't someone step in and straighten these idiots out?!?I am so sorry that this continues to happen to you and I hope the needles arrive soon.Corrie",

    "question": "OK my Diabetes doctor switched me to using a pen for my insulin shots due to vision and fine motor control problems. So today I received the pens via NEXT DAY AIR. But the VA has still not shipped the needles for the pen. Shipments from the VA in Nashville only take a day to get to my home once they are shipped. They notified the USPS yesterday that they were going to ship the needles from Nashville.So just how messed up is the VA?1. they could have actually shipped the needles yesterday.2. they could have waited on having the pens shipped until the day they actually shipped the needles.3. they could have had the pens shipped via regular service and saved some money since they didn't ship the needles.Oh I also got the decision from them on my wrist over the weekend. They completely ignored the fact that I have had trouble with my hand / wrist since my fall Jan. 30th 2015. They completely ignored the fact the MRI done Jan 2016 show torn ligament and cartilage. They instead said my wrist and hand are messed up due to degenerative arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0Is it no wonder that Vets are irate at the VA?Dennis",
