            "answer": "Hi Geo4472,I am glad you found us at the Pain Management Community of MedHelp. But I am sorry to hear about the pain in your arm.There are a multitude of conditions that be affecting your arm and causing pain. This could be caused by Peripheral nerve compression, Diabetes, Peripheral Neuropathy or a strained ligament or muscle or many other conditions.It is interesting that the pain occurs when you lay on your stomach. So could this pain be originating in the shoulder and what are you experiencing is referred pain?\u00a0\u00a0Referred pain means the source of the pain is in a different location than were the pain is being felt. I know it sounds crazy but it is not uncommon.The obvious suggesting is to tell you not to lay on your stomach. And I would avoid that position until you are able to have a diagnostic work up. Rest the area as much as possible. If it feels better to immobilize it you may want to do so during the day. It could be something that if left untreated could cause permanent damage so I encourage you to make an appointment with you PCP asap.Others will post with their opinions and suggestions. Best of luck to you. Please keep in touch and let us know how you are doing. I will look for your next update. Take Care, Tuck",
