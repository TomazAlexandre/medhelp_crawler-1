            "answer": "so sorry to read abt your dear kitty, they sure worry us when they are ill and we can't find out whats wrong.Your current Vet really needs to test her for Hyperthyroid....of course it could be many reasons but HyperT is the most common one when we hear of not eating much and vomiting.She should also be tested for Diabetes....although at a regular weight of 10 lbs she was not over weight, its usually the heavy kitties that develop diabetes..You can't keep waiting for her to get better, something is seriously wrong and you need a Vet who will do some extensive testing REAL SOON, not eating well, vomiting and weight loss for a cat is a VERY serious concerngood luck...please let us know how it all goes for her:(",
