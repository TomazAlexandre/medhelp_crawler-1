            "answer": "It's difficult figuring it out, isn't it!Yes, it is... trust me, and I believe pretty much everyone else here would agree that when you're first diagnosed it's confusing and overwhelming.I'll tell you this... for immediate blood sugar control, drastically cut your carbohydrate intake, increase your fiber intake, and increase your activity (yeah, \"exercise\" but really, just activity... take the stairs, park further away from the store than you usually would, etc) and then slowly adjust your diet... and really, please, see a nutritionist... I can't begin to tell you how helpful they can be... when I was first diagnosed I thought I \"knew\" what good nutrition was, but I learned SO much about how to truly read a nutritional label and ingredients and how to eat to help control my blood sugars that what I spent for seeing a nutritionist was an amazing investment in the return of learning how to control my diabetes through diet thus decreasing my doc visits, tests, and meds... honestly.\u00a0\u00a0If there is a diabetes educator in your area, they are really helpful too...Keep us updated on your progress!",

    "question": "Can anyone direct me to a good website that will teach me how and what to eat. I am sure I am going to get a diagnosis of Type 2 diabetes this week. My blood glucose this AM when I woke up was 200. It's been running about 125-130 all week. I also get some pretty low numbers during the day and start to feel weak and jittery. I'd just like to see what the diet looks like before I go in to see my doctor. Thanks.",
