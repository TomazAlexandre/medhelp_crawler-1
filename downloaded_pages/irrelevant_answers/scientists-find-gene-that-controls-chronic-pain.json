            "answer": "Thanks for sharing El. I admit I have not yet read the article, but I will.You know I don't quite understand this all .... and certainly I should. For instances if one has multiple cysts (inoperable) on the nerve roots of their spine, or if one has severe DDD or Spinal Stenosis, or a failed back surgery mesh.... the list could go on.... isn't this a reason to have chronic pain? Are the scientist saying that we shouldn't feel this pain??I completely understand that Chronic Pain is a disease, just as real as diabetes. I also know that some pain conditions don't have a lot of rhyme or reason as to why they produce pain or scientist have not yet figured out the rational .... but for those ppl that have a documented pain producing problem such as mentioned above is this supposedly due to a gene defect?Chronic Pain is usually defined by ANY pain that lasts longer then three months and doesn't that cover a multitude of physical ailments?? It's something that never made sense to me. I guess I am not expecting any concrete answers... as many physicians cannot agree on this subject. Just some food for thought!Again thanks for the info. :o)~Tuck",
