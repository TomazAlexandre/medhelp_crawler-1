            "answer": "That's really odd.\u00a0\u00a0I have not only the antibodies, but actual Hep C disease, chronic, over a year; I informed my eye dr & they did the surgery, no problems.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any other diseases, diabetes, dry eye syndrome, etc. that could've caused them to turn you down?\u00a0\u00a0Also, I heard they don't operate on people whose pupils are too large because they end up with permanent halos/glare/starbursts afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0Did they actually tell you the Hep C disqualified you as a candidate?\u00a0\u00a0If you can, go with a Laser Center affiliated surgeon, they're very good & have a lifetime guarantee (Tiger Woods is their spokesperson; I went through them via my insurance).",
