            "answer": "Hi, myocardial bridge is an anomaly characterized by a typical intramyocardial route of a segment of one of the major coronary arteries. Blood thinners may not help and majority of people with this anomaly are asymptomatic. However, if blood supply to the heart is compromised, you may then need surgical intervention. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. In the meantime you can focus on controlling high risk factors like obesity, hypertension, diabetes and dyslipidemia.
