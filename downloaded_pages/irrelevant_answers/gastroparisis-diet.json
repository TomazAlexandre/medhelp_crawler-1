            "answer": "Hello mbm1954,I am not a medical professional ,so my input is based on personal experience in taking care of my son (almost 10) who was diagnosed with type 1 at the age of 3.Here is some info. I found on this page -http://www.lifescan.com/care/complications/gastroparesisa few simple changes in diet may help resolve symptoms. For example, you may be able to reduce feelings of fullness by eating many small meals, rather than a few large ones, each day. It may also help to cut down on foods that are high in fat (which slows emptying of the stomach) and foods high in fiber (which is difficult to digest). Some high-fiber foods, such as broccoli and citrus fruits, should be avoided altogether, since they are only partially digestible and will remain in the stomach. Liquid meals, which pass through the stomach more easily, may replace some meals containing solid foods._______________Here is some more info.Meal and food changesChanging your eating habits can help control gastroparesis. Your doctor or dietitian will give you specific instructions, but you may be asked to eat six small meals a day instead of three large ones. If less food enters the stomach each time you eat, it may not become overly full. Or the doctor or dietitian may suggest that you try several liquid meals a day until your blood glucose levels are stable and the gastroparesis is corrected. Liquid meals provide all the nutrients found in solid foods, but can pass through the stomach more easily and quickly.The doctor may also recommend that you avoid fatty and high-fiber foods. Fat naturally slows digestion--a problem you do not need if you have gastroparesis--and fiber is difficult to digest. Some high-fiber foods like oranges and broccoli contain material that cannot be digested. Avoid these foods because the indigestible part will remain in the stomach too long and possibly form bezoars.____________You\u00a0\u00a0may have already found the same info.\u00a0\u00a0If so, I apologize.\u00a0\u00a0Have you talked to your Endocrinologist about seeing a Dietician???I do apologize that I could not give you a direct answer as to a specific site with more info. pertaining to meals / food.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to pass on your question to another volunteer who I am sure can give you some more complete info.Regards,SS",

            "answer": "I do not know if there is a published diet, but I can tell you what I do to minimize the effects of gastroparisis. I have been diabetic for over 40 years, and suffered the effects of this complication for about 25 of them. I have found that eliminating any food that is hard or slow to break down makes the problem much less severe for me. I no longer eat any red meat, focusing on fish and chicken. This also has the benefit of avoiding lows and highs as these foods digest much later than normal, throwing off the synchronization with my insulin. I also avoid coarse vegetables, such as broccoli, lettuce and even corn when my stomach is acting up. These will also sit there for at least a day causing discomfort. I also find that not eating until I am full helps a lot in avoiding the backup into my throat (more smaller meals). With the struggle in my stomach to digest these foods, I often also have significant stomach acid and heartburn. Avoiding acidic foods such as tomatoes and normal acid orange juice (low acid is available) helps this. I also consume a lot of Tums, which helps ward off the acid attacks, and also gives me a good calcium source. I have found that drug based antacids work, but I get a rebound of acid for days if I stop taking them. I also worry about systemic effects on the liver from these drugs. Most of my knowledge is from trial and error, and everyone is different. I hope this is of help in your finding the diet that works for you.Larry",

            "answer": "Dear mbm1954,Thank you so much for reaching out to JDRF. My son was diagnosed four years ago and I know how terrible that it can be. Gastroparesis can range from a very mild complication to very extreme. We do know that a very low fat diet is very important, as well as no fruits or vegetables, unless they are cooked extremely hard. I am reviewing my past diet information and have found that some former sites that were reliable are no longer available. I will research this more and try to come up with the most recent ones. Six meals a day and chewing your food very well can help, along with tight control of glucose levels. My son is on the more extreme side and as such has had more problems. This may not be the case with you or who ever you are concerned about. I will say that the research is finally starting to move on this issue. We do have more information then we have had from past years. New, but very interesting.Everyone here has given you very good information on this thread. I am also not a physician and cannot give you medical information except as a layperson. I am starting to be encouraged with the research and what options that are becoming available.As a JDRF volunteer, I might suggest that with the issue of gastroparesis, you may want to contact our JDRF sister outreach program at www.jdrf.org, click on life with diabetes and then the Online Diabetes Support Team. This is a one on one private communication that will give you communication from someone who is dealing with the same issue.My Very Best,dm",

Let's face it,no one wants to let a 26-year old order a kids meal. I've used it a few times and have found it handy. I'm very grateful to the organization for making them",
