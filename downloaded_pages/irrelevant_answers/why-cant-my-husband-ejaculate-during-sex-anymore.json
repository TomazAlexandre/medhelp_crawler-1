    "question": "My husband and I have been married for 10 months and have been together for over 3 years. We have both always been very sexual people and can't go longer than 48 hours without having sex. We have been very in sync when It comes to sex but lately things have changed. Recently, my husband cant seem to stay hard or ejaculate durning sex. We have tried many times and nothing seems to work. I felt bad with how frustrated he has become over this so I gave him oral and he was rock hard the whole time and had no problem ejaculating. He gets oral at least twice a month so I know it's not a lack of that. I can't help but feel like it's just me that he isn't sexually attracted to anymore. What else could it be!?",
