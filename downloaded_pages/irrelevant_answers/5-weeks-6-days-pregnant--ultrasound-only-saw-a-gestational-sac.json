Waited about a week later and went back to my OB for the last ultrasound before having my D&C and they found the baby and heartbeat. Im now 8 1/2 weeks and everything is great and healthy. It may be too early still. Don't give up. :)",

    "question": "H All- A little about me. Two failed IVF's. Husband and I were preparing for our next IVF round in January, so doctor put me on Metformin (even though I do not have diabetes or PCOS) to potentially help with egg quality even though all my numbers were good. Basically unexplained infertility. Long story short, we found out last week that we are pregnant!My fertility specialist had me come in today, and only saw a gestational sac. He didn't alarm me, but also didn't overly make me feel good either. He said to return in 7 to 10 days. He wants to see a yolk sac and potentially a heart beat by then.Should I be panicked? I suffer from severe anxiety, so I am trying to really remain calm. Is it possible I miscarried and that is why no yolk sac appeared? Looking for reassurance...Thanks!",
