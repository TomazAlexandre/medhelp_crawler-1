    "question": "Hi, I am 29 yrs. old and I have diabetes type 1 and was diagnosed about 8 yrs. ago. About 4 years ago my vision started to gradually decline and about a year and a half ago I began to get strong headaches and eyeaches constantly almost everyday. About eight months ago I had an MRI and it came back negative. A month ago I had a spinal tap and the results came out like this: CSF Index: CSF IGG\u00a0\u00a0 *40.40 mg/dL,\u00a0\u00a0CSF Albumin\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0*110.00 mg/dL,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0CSF Ratio\u00a0\u00a0*0.37\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Serum IGG\u00a0\u00a0 1380.00\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Serum Albumin\u00a0\u00a0 4760.00\u00a0\u00a0 Index\u00a0\u00a0*1.28.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor doesn't know what can be causing this and he has ruled out MS. He has ordered blood work but everything has come back negative. What do you think all this may mean?",
