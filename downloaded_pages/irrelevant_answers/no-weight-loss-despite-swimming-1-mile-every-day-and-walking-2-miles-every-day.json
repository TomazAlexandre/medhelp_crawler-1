            "answer": "Sometimes, if you do the same exercise all the time and do not add to it (i.e.,walk 3 miles every day,up hills, weight machines, etc.) your body stays the same. Also, try Weight Watchers - their plan helps you lose weight and still eat well, maybe better than you are eating now. And they encourage exercise as part of their plan. Good luck.",

            "answer": "your walking and swimming have to be at a faster pace than your normal day to day chores.i did not lose weight until i switch from breast stroke to free style,then i went to the weight room and use different machines and set the weights so that it would require me to exert myself .hypo thyroidism does not have that much to do with weight gain,taking in more than you burn has a lot to do with weight gain.it sounds like you have a good program,all you need is to move at a faster tempo.",

    "question": "I am badly overweight and have been trying for a year or more to lose weight.Every weekday morning I swim 32 lengths of a 50m pool in less than 50 minutes. Every weekday afternoon I go for a 1 hour walk.Despite this plus largely healthy eating and lots of water-drinking, I am not losing ANY weight whatsoever.My metabolism seems very slow. I know this as my bowels move a maximum of once per day, more likely once every two or three days.What is wrong with me?",
