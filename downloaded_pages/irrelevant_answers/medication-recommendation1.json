            "answer": "well risperdol and abilify are listed as drugs not safe for pregnancy so they are not suitable for me as I want to have a baby...I olanzapine is the safest thing for me. I will just have to change my to a healthy diet and watch my calories to mimimize weight gain. Last time I was on olanzapine I was way more social then I am on zeldox. And I sleep good. zeldox was the catalyst for starting problems with insomnia which I never had before I started zeldox. I really don't like it.",

            "answer": "I would just go with olanzapine then, I was just listing off ones I took and citing examples of how they worked for me.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps you can switch to one with less of a chance of weight gain such as Abilify after your pregnancy is over with if weight gain is enough of an issue for you.",

    "question": "Does anyone know a medication for schizoaffective disorder that doesn't make you a boring person with a flat personality and doesn't make you gain weight as well as being safe to take while pregnant and breastfeeding?I know olanzapine has been given to pregnant women and breastfeeding women but it causes weight gain even if you don't change your diet after you start it. I gained 50lbs last time I took it and I can't afford to gain 50lbs again because I would probably get diabetes.What about seroquel? Does it affect your personality? But I read it causes complications to fetuses and so I don't want to start it.I want a drug that will still allow me to be a interesting talkative person like I am without meds.The priority is one that is least harmful to a pregnancy. Second, is it gives me a good personality. lastly, the weight factor.",
