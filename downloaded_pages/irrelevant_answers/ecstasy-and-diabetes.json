            "answer": "Hi,I would also discourage taking ecstacy, although I have done it alot over the last year and a half. Anyone who has any heart or circulatory problems should avoid it, as it puts strain on the heart and narrows blood vessels (temporarilly). Anita, ecstacy has been linked to deaths, some 200 since 1996, which is alot lower than many legal drugs including painkillers such as paracetamol.So I would not advise doing ecstacy as it can have adverse affects on those who are out of shape or have issues relating to circulation or the heart. But as far as drugs go, it is generally very safe and doing it every 1 or 2 years will not do you any significant harm. If you enjoy it, use it responsibly and infrequently then I can see nothing bad coming from it.I think Anita is badly informed on ecstasy, like many of those in the mdical profession. If you have tried it, you should be more than aware of its effects on the body, which are mild. Essentially, it is up to you to decide, but as someone who has used it some 30 or so times in the last 18 months, I can say that in my experience it has been perfectly safe.",

    "question": "my husband (60) has Type II diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol which are being managed very well by Lipitor, Lisenpril, Actos and Metformin. Before he was diagnosed (2004) we enjoyed Ecstasy maybe once every 1 or 2 yrs. It was an amazing experience for both of us, our relationship, our communication. As older adults we managed the experience (reliable source for E, hydration, calm location) carefully and respectfully. We'd love to do it again once or twice, but can't seem to get any information about drug interactions, so given his drugs - can you see any immediate danger?\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors would say don't do it based on fear or lack of knowledge, but is there anyone out there that can give us reliable, good advice based on experience?",
