            "answer": "HiHigh eosinophil count is seen in autoimmune problems like Hashimotos\u2019s thyroiditis. Other problems like asthma, eczema etc too show a high eosinophil count. Low monocytes are taken as a marker of state oh health, which is not perfect. They are low in aplastic anemaia. Marginally low values are expected with chronic health problems.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.",

I actually do have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 and only diagnosed in May of this year.\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational diabetes 7 years ago and have suspected that my insulin never returned to normal.\u00a0\u00a0I was taking Metformin 500 2x daily which was then changed to Janumet 500/50 2x daily.\u00a0\u00a0I have done very well with diet and exercise and for some very strange reason, upon beginning treatment for the pituitary tumor and thyroid medicine, my blood sugars have been in range perfectly and when taking Janumet I actually experience severe low sugars, so I have stopped taking it.\u00a0\u00a0My endocrinolgoist does know that I have stopped taking it.\u00a0\u00a0My last A1c was 5.5. She asked that I continue testing though.\u00a0\u00a0My paternal grandma also has Type 2 and high blood pressure as well as Alzhiemers now.PS. the new blood pressure medicine is lisinopril.\u00a0\u00a0Seems like it's a prettty serious medication, I figured they'd start me off with something a little lower to try to control it in the beginning, especially being in childbearing years, it seems to have a lot of risk to a fetus.Thank you again for your response.Sarah",
