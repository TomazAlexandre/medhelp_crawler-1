    "question": "I have this quite large cyst on the inner part of the right lip of my vagina. I noticed this about a week ago when it was smaller. Now it has grown bigger and I can't tell if it's getting bigger at the moment. It is VERY painful when I sit down, walk, and lay down. I'm having a REALLY hard time sleeping too. I tried squeezing it, but it hurts too much to even finish squeezing it. I don't have any money or health insurance. Does anyone know how I can get rid of this WITHOUT going to a doctor? PLEASE HELP ME WITH EASY SOLUTIONS.",
