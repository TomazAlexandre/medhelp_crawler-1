            "answer": "hi! thanks a lot for ur reply. the prickiness is gone :) however i wanted to\u00a0\u00a0ask u .. ive been having headaches, and mild numbness on my right sole. it feels like my knee has some pain and then the sole is where its reflected. i went to the doctor here and she said u have exam tensions and the numbness will go away. she said i dont have any neurologic symptom. but im really worried esp about my headache. my question is wat are the neurological symptoms that would make one suspicious of something serious ? and regarding diabetes i checked my blood sugar and it was normal. so what else could be causing my numbness? can tension cause it ? i dont think im tooo tensed though! i have a mild staph infection on my scalp. could this lead to this kinda headache ? thanks a lot for ur help. keep in touch :)",

            "answer": "Hi.Exam tension alone will not cause the numbness.There are two possibilities that I can think of. One, there is a pinched nerve in you lower back which is causing the pain in the knee and the numbness in the sole. Two, your headaches are migraine headaches, which are known to cause symptoms of tingling and/or numbness.Do you have exams coming up ? They you may not waste time visiting the doctors, but if you can spare some time, please visit a Neurologist. I would also suggest a nerve conduction study on the lower limb to find out any nerve problem.All the best.",
