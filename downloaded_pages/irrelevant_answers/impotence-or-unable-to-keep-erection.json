            "answer": "This is just one of many possible complications that can happen to people with type 1 diabetes when glucose levels are left too high. Unfortunately, it appears that right now, doctors have not had a great deal of success working to help patients recover from damage to nerves and small blood vessels. But some type 1 diabetic people that I know who have various complications do report that tightening up glucose control seems to help in time. The body can repair itself SOME, depending on how severe the damage is. Your husband's a1c number is an indication of how well he is doing at keeping his glucose levels normalized.So the first thing I would suggest is for you and your husband to focus foremost on working with his doctor to try to achieve normal glucose levels and to keep them. He should discuss this very personal problem with his doctor, who may be able to help him the best. I am not aware of any supplements that will address the root cause of the problem. Treating the symptom (impotence) is probably not the answer, for the real problem is high glucose levels. Normalize the glucose levels, and the body can function better if the physical damage is not too great. And of course, this helps protect him from further damage.",

            "answer": "impotence in this case may be caused by loss of blood flow to the penis or damaged blood vessels in the same region it may be worth a shot .. try viagra or camagra for a cheaper alternative.. this works by dramatically increasing the blood flow to the genitals it can be expensive.. up to 100 us dollars for 4 to 8 doses but have heard it does work.However i would certainly say that dependent on age and length of time you have had the problem getting control of your blood sugars is likely to help most. Good luck.",
