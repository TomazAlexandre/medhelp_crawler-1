    "question": "I have recently been feeling very lightheaded and spacey, with throbbing headaches around my temples and the front of my head. My heart suddenly starts to race for afew seconds which makes me feel more lightheaded, and this occurs about twice or three times a day. I have not fainted but people say that I look pale. I have feeling spacey like this for a while (a couple of weeks) however it has suddenly (within the past few days) got worse. I am not overweight and have no underlying medical condidtions. I have been taking paracetemol for the headaches, but sometimes it doesnt work and they usually return a few hours later.Please could someone tell me what they think, if anything, is wrong with me?",
