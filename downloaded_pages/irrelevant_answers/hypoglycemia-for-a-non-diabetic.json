            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Hypoglycemia is a condition where the blood glucose goes below normal levels. This can be due to overproduction of insulin, certain disorders of the adrenal glands and the pituitary gland, liver and kidney disease, and certain medications. The way to begin to treat your hypoglycemia is to work with your doctor to find the underlying cause. Treating the cause will help to treat the hypoglycemia.I hope this helps.Cathy",

            "answer": "One way to get hypoglycemia is for your pancreas to work over time and produce too much insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin lowers BG, carbs raise BG. your body also makes BG from protien.so for some people eating carbohydrates, carbs causes the BG to rise this causes the pancreas\u00a0\u00a0to make insulin if the pancreas does not stop making insulin the BG drops once the BG is gone.some people have relefe from hypoglycemia by restricting the amount of carbs they eat.Foe some people eating smaller meals more often helps.Im NOT an MD.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Hypoglycemia 2 years ago . I don't understand the reason people get hypoglycemia. I read online is when diabetic people are taking their medications their sugar level go very low sometimes it can cause Hypoglycemia episodes. Is there any other reason why I would have hypoglycemia if I don't have diabetes?Also is there a high chance that hypoglycemia can turn to diabetes?ThanksVM",
