            "answer": "Definitely sounds like neuropathy to me, too. There are different types and from what I've read, it is very common for those nerve tests and B12 to come back normal. Maybe see a different neurologist, if this one is not receptive to looking into your problem further. A lot of things can cause neuropathies other than diabetes. I have small fiber neuropathy as a result of bactrim. I would want more tests to be done, because, if possible, they might find the underlying problem and treat that. There are also creams and medication that can be prescribed to help with the pain.Best of luck to you.",
