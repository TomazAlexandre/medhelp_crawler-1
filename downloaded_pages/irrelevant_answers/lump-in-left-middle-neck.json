            "answer": "Hi,Any infection in and around the neck, would produce these swellings. These swellings are basically enlarged lymph nodes in body.The gum abcess you have could produce such kind of swelling. You can meet a general surgeon and undergo incision and drainage of abcess under cover of antibiotics.If swelling still persists, then a biopsy could be done to assess, whether it is benign or malignant.",

            "answer": "Lymph nodes from viral infections such as those in mononucleosis tend to persists for 2-3 weeks. Some will not completely resolve and tend to return whenever you have another infection. If you have an abscess in your gums, then it is likely that the node is a reaction to the infection in your mouth. The infection may well have been there even before the appearance of the actual abscess. It may be a good idea to see a dentist about this.Vitamin C is good for wound healing, may be a good idea for the gums. In order to improve healing of the node, there is no magic diet beyond what is usually recommended to lower the risk for heart disease and diabetes.",

    "question": "Hi,I am a helathy 29 year old female, working out, never smoked, drink couple glasses of wine weekly.18 days ago, I found a lump 2cm big, on my left neck. I went to see a doctor, he put me on Amoxycilin 850 mg for 10 day. No change.I went to see ENT doctor 5 days ago, he did CBC- normal, mono spot - neg.He said to wait 3 weeks and come back to see him.I admit the forst 14 days, I was touching the lump every 20 min. trying to see whats going on with it. I did not touch it now for 2 days. No change.About 2 weeks before I discovered it, I had a little gum abscess on right side and felt very tired for about 3 days for no reason.I am very scared of cancer and it is ruining every day of my life. I can stand the wait if it disappears or not.What are the chances it is serious? How long does it usually take for the lump to go away if you stop touching it completely?Can I help it somehow? ( special nutrition, vitamines or sauna?)\\Thank youPetulka",
