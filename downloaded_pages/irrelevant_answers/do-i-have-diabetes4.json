            "answer": "Hello,the only way to know if you have diabetes or not is to test your blood sugar.This can be by the doctor, or you can buy a home blood sugar meter and test at home.Fasting blood sugar should be < 95 (ideally in the 80s)After eating (2 hours after starting to eat), should be < 120 (Ideally also in the 80 - 100 range).What you are talking about with the dark skin is called Acanthosis nigricans. It doesn't mean absolutely that you will have diabetes, but it does indicate insulin resistance.If you and your boyfriend are wanting a baby it is highly recommended that you work on your fitness and health first. Particularly you need to know if you have diabetes as it can affect both\u00a0\u00a0your ability to get pregnant, and where there is a good outcome to the pregnancy.Your other symptoms may be due to irritation from having sex, or you could possibly have a mild UTI.\u00a0\u00a0Try drinking more water.\u00a0\u00a0Also make sure you urinate before and after having sex.\u00a0\u00a0If that doesn't help it might we worth seeing a Dr (and also asking about the diabetes).",

            "answer": "Thank you. I will have my blood sugar tested. My Dad told me the same thing. That I should start working out, not only for me but when me and my boyfriend decide to have a baby. My first pregnancy did not turn out well and I would want my next one to be healthy. And I think it was a mild UTI I started taking cranberry pills and drinking more water, ever since I haven't felt the urge to pee, only normal trips to the restroom. Lol.",

            "answer": "I used to have severe insulin resistance with chronically high insulin levels due to my diet high in added sugar so I have acanothosis nigricans (dark patches of skin) myself. Most people with acanothosis nigricans have insulin resistance (the excess insulin causes the skin to darken).I reversed my insulin resistance getting rid of the added sugar in my diet. It's been almost 2 years since I changed my diet and got my insulin levels down and my skin is looking much better. I could not lose any body fat due to high insulin so when I changed my diet this is when I finally saw weight loss. So far I've lost 14 kg and my waist to hip ratio has gone from 0.96 to 0.86.",

    "question": "Okay, so it started off with me having a dark skin area right between my breast and I looked it up. People were saying it's fungal or it could be from sweating alot and I am big from the chest, where I work I sweat alot or it can be Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome. Which i have had Molar Pregnancy but about 3 years ago. or it can also be obesity, and Im not in shape. I am big for my size I guess. Last I checked I weighed around 170 I think and I'm 21. Anyway I told my mom about it she was thinking I had diabetes. Then I noticed on the back of my neck I saw it was dark there too and I know people with diabetes get dark on the neck. Another thing is when I go shopping with my mom I tend to get hot when the place is cold and fresh. I start to sweat not like dripping sweat but if I wipe my forehead its a little wet. Okay and one more thing is me and my boyfriend decided to try and have a baby, the first night he ejaculated in me, I started to feel like I needed to pee like all the time. I peed and i'll sit down then I still have that feeling that I need to go. So I go back I sit down and nothing but a little little bit comes out. But yet I still feel like i gotta go. I was thinking I had a UTI I've never gotten one only once when\u00a0\u00a0I was little but it doesn't hurt to pee or anything. It's just the feeling that I need to go when I really dont. It's uncomfortable and annoying. Anyway can someone tell me if you think I have it? Or can it be something else..",
