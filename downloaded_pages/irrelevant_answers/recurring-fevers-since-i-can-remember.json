            "answer": "You definitely need to have a full workup done. If your immunities are weakened, you need to know the cause. It sounds like you are very prone to infections, and a poor imune system is NOT anything to be casual about. The delerious behaviour you experience when your fever is spiked is to be expected, but that doesn't make it acceptable. You need to be treated for whatever it is you have. Lupas can cause weakened immunities as well as HIV, Leaukemia, and many other conditions. I suggest you see a an Internal Med. Specialist or maybe\u00a0\u00a0Hematologist that specializes in Blood disorders. Don't let people sweep this under the rug while you suffer. You are an adult, take your health into your hands and get the care you deserve!Please keep us posted on how you are doing. Oh and do NOT take more of the headache tablets than are recommended on the package. This can cause severe Liver damage, and the last thing you need is MORE problems.--J",

    "question": "I am 18 now and since I can remember I have been having a recurring fever. Although I can remember having these fevers when I was as young as 7 or 8 but I think they were less frequent. For the past year at least every month or two I will become sick for at least a week and it has caused me to lose my job.When I have these fevers I get really dizzy and can go for days without eating or sleeping. When I try to eat anyting I will usually throw up an hour or so later. At some points It gets so bad that I will actually be delirious and its embarrassing to say but I will actually run around the house rambling stuff to myself. I will often have very strange distorted dreams that actually hurt to think about the next day.I have seen a doctor about this a few times but I feel like he always seems to brush this aside and the latest time I went there I described all the symptoms and he said it was just a throat infection and prescribed penecillin and told me to take two headache tablets 3 times a day. The penecillin worked but it took a few days and during that time I would have to take a LOT of headache tablets for them to do anything and would often worry I would od on them.My mum tells me that I just have a weak immune system although I do think I eat quite healthy because my family is a vegetarian. I still eat a small amount of red meat and once or twice a week have takeaway. Also my younger sister has diabetes if this means anything.I was wondering if it could be anything deeper than bad immunity and if you think its just my immunity how I can improve it. Thanks",
