            "answer": "I am assuming your optic nerve swelling is a FINDING, since nobody knows what their optic nerve is doing on a day to day basis as a symptom.\u00a0\u00a0But you said your MRI and CT scans were normal.\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, the problem with that nerve might help explain your symptoms, and you should visit either an opthalmologist or neurologist to get that condition under control before you wind up with damaged eyesight.\u00a0\u00a0As for what causes that to happen, I am not sure, but a specialist should be able to recognize the picture of the optic nerve finding and your other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few ideas, altho I don't know for sure, It's possible you have a heart condition, or diabetes, or some nerve disease.",

            "answer": "I would repeat the MRI of the brain(it has been two years) and obtain an MRI of the Cervical Spine.\u00a0\u00a0When is the last time you have seen a Neurologist?\u00a0\u00a0I would not bother with another CT; just MRIs at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever you do, make sure someone is investigating the optic nerve swelling and of course the other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing really can be done about optic nerve damage; they can only save what eyesight you have left.At the end of the day, you are your own best advocate for your health.\u00a0\u00a0Keep pushing until you find the help you need.Keep us posted.",

    "question": "For the past four years I have had a number of reoccurring symptoms that include, joint pain, headaches, numbness feeling in my face, hands and feet, optic nerve swelling, short term memory loss, just to name a few. I have had a number of test done and they have all come out normal, eeg, nerve test, blood work, mri (last one two years ago brain only), ct, and spinal tap. I am at a loss because no one can seem to know what going on and every time the symptoms come back they are worse. What could be causing this? Any other test I can request to be done?",
