            "answer": "Hi Staley,I think it is a transient feeling of numbness in your finger tips. It could be due to vitamin B12 deficiency certainly though there are lots of other causes too.Other causes include nerve impingement, Diabetes, Pre-Diabetes, Blood pressure abnormality, and endocrine abnormality.In your case it appears to be due to nerve compression like ulnar nerve or median nerve and Vitamin B12 deficiency.Is there a particular finger tip which is getting affected or all finger tips are having numbness?Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",

            "answer": "It is all of the fingertips (except maybe not the thumbs so much), and when it happens and I touch something it doesn't feel the same. So it isn't totally numb, but going in that direction. Like I said, it happens due to straining, and does go away in a few minutes or so. At other times during the day, my fingers tend to get really cold, but I'm not sure if it is related or not. I recently had an emg/ncv which they said was normal. My fasting blood glucose last summer was 104 mg/dl and my A1C was 6%. My blood pressure is usually around 120/80. I'll check into the b12 possibility. I'm not sure what endocrine is, so I'll look into that too. Any further advice would be appreciated, if anything comes to mind. Thanks.",
