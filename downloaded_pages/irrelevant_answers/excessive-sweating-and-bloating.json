            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well, usually excessive sweating in children is not a cause of alarm in itself. However, in your nephew\u2019s case, there are other accompanying symptoms too. Hence, it is important to get proper investigations done to rule out certain conditions.First is to test for diabetes. Hyperthyroidism is another cause. In kids with persistent cough and sweating or other upper respiratory infections coming on and off, a heart condition cannot be ruled out.I suggest you take a second opinion. Preferably consult a cardiologist and an endocrine specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
