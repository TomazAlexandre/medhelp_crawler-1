            "answer": "That is absolutely impossible to say, especially for someone on an internet website! All diabetics are different. I'm assuming she is Type 2 as that is the forum you are posting to? It would depend on her degree of insulin resistance, her weight and other factors. Is she newly diagnosed? Didn't her doctor give her a starting dose? Is she on a basal/bolus regimen or just on the basal (Lantus). You say she is having trouble adjusting doses. What was she on before and what were the results? If she is experiencing lows or highs in her fasting and in between meals and bedtime than I would adjust the Lantus accordingly up or down. Always adjust a very small amount initially and see how that works for a couple days. If she is experiencing highs or lows two hours after meals than it would be her bolus and her Insulin:Carb ratio needs tweaking. You need to give a bit more information for us to go on. But if she is brand new to diabetes then I would definitely ask her doctor or endo to give her a starting dose and work from there. The important thing with self-adjusting insulin doses is to always be conservative. One low or high is not a reason to adjust, a pattern of lows or highs is.",

            "answer": "My daughter was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes when she was 5 years old. She has been giving NPH with Humalog. It hasn't been working much though because she's high most of the time even when we watch what she eats and exercises. It just doesn't make much sense why the NPH isn't working anymore. She's on a sliding scale for Humalog and she gives a shot of 40 units of NPH in the morning.",

            "answer": "NPH is a very old form of insulin. Also giving a sliding scale for her bolus, Humalog is an outdated way of dosing. More current is using an insulin:carb ratio so that the dose is geared to the carbs she is eating. I would suggest you take your daughter to an endo and ask to have her placed on the more up to date treatment regimen of a long-acting basal, which would be either Lantus or Levemir, and bolus such as the Humalog with a dose determined by insulin:carb ratio. I also highly recommend the book, Using Insulin by John Walsh.",

            "answer": "As usual Zoelula has provided excellent advice, particuliarly the book by John Walsh.That being said, I cannot concieve of any physician prescribing Lantus without the patient being given a precise and thorough explanation of how much to use and when. There is a BIG missing piece here.There are many excellent programs set up to monitor diabetics and keep them on the right track. Some are run by nurses or nurse practicioners. There are weekly meetings and they call you on the telephone to check-up on you and see how your glucose readings are doing and provide support.I am not a happy camper with a diabetic being provided with medication such as Lantus and then not being provided with instructions and an appropriate protocol.This is best done in-person with a professional who keeps in close contact with the patient.If this is not the case with your daughter, seek another practicioner or a diabetes center that has a complete program of education and assistance.",
