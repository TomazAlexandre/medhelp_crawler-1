            "answer": "How are you? What other symptoms are present? Numbness or tingling of the hands is more likely caused by poor circulation in your hands. Carpal tunnel syndrome which presents as numbness, tingling or burning pain, and weakness in the thumb, index and middle fingers. These symptoms appear at night because many people sleep with bent wrists which further compresses the carpal tunnel. If the median nerve is already under stress, the increased compression of the bent wrist results in numbness and tingling.Common conditions that can lead to carpal tunnel syndrome include obesity, pregnancy,\u00a0\u00a0hypothyroidism, arthritis, diabetes, and trauma. Tendon inflammation resulting from repetitive work can also cause carpal tunnel symptoms.This can be a temporary condition that completely resolves or it can persist and progress. If it persists, it would be good to see a neurologist for proper evaluation and order tests to measure circulation and nerve conduction.
