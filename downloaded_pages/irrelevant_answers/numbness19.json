            "answer": "Could be either you have a lumbar spine injury that is affecting the nerve sensation into the legs, causing them to be numb, OR could be a circulatory problem, where blood flow is not working properly in the legs due to some blood vessel abnormality, including diabetes, or even a heart or possibly lung problem.\u00a0\u00a0You need to visit a regular doctor or internal medicine doctor and get a complete workup done based on your symptoms, because while the lumbar problem is less problematic, a circulatory problem can be rather serious.\u00a0\u00a0Wish I could tell you exactly what it is, but I cannot.\u00a0\u00a0So, I hope you will visit a general doc and let them narrow things down, and then they'll send you to the proper specialist(s) to determine what your diagnosis is.",

            "answer": "Hi there. You will need a detailed evaluation for this numbness in lower limbs. systemic illnesses like diabetes, hypothyroidism, vitamin B 12 deficiency, nerve entrapments and compression, local trauma causing nerve injury, rheumatoid arthritis, degenerative disc disease and prolapsed disc etc. you need to get all your medicines checked up since numbness and paresthesiae can also occur as a side effect of certain medications. Consult a physician urgently and you would need certain blood tests and MRI spine. Hope this helps. Take care.",
