    "question": "I have three different physicians right now two of them say that I need to have my blood sugar under control, my psychiatrist and my liver doctor. They have all done blood work and told me to give the results to my PCP, whose bloodwork on me comes back normal.........I see my PCP the least amount of times. Why does my glucose fluctuate so much? I have Bi-polar, Stage 3 liver disease, Arthritis of the spine, and Hypertesion!!! My meds are Seroquel, Lithium, Inderal, Lisinopril, Ultram, Klonopin, and Nxium along with 81mg of aspirin. My glucose levels have been recorded as high as 165 (fasting) by Labs (Quest) and 245 by my home meter!!!! Diabeties 2 is in my family from my mothers side.........What should I do????? I am supposed to start Interferon/Ribivirin sometime this month!!! Thank you for you feedback!!!! Last bloodwork from my pcp was115 glucose and 5.3 HGB A1C......Peace",
