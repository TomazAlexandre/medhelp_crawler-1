    "question": "I have three large ovarian cysts, my right ovary has a 10cm dermoid cyst and what looked like to me a similar sized simple cyst right next to each other and my left ovary has a smaller dermoid (it looked similar sized to the other two)\u00a0\u00a0I don't recall the sizes of the others.\u00a0\u00a0I am scheduled for laprotomy (open) surgery this Wednesday.\u00a0\u00a0Late tonight, I started to feel bloated and gassy (nothing new) although I hadn't really eaten anything that would merit that.\u00a0\u00a0Within a half hour, I had intense pain not down by my ovaries or even stomach but slightly higher in my mid back.\u00a0\u00a0I was curled on the floor so I reached for my extra strength ibuprofen and almost immediately vomited.\u00a0\u00a0It felt like something was popping my ribs; I was shaking and had trouble breathing.\u00a0\u00a0The attack subsided enough for me to take a Narco pill prescribed to me when I had my cysts diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0After an hour I was finally able to stretch out.\u00a0\u00a0My question is has anyone here had a similar experience?\u00a0\u00a0The pain was so high up could it be caused by my cysts pushing on my organs?\u00a0\u00a0I am only waiting for morning to call my gyn, with the Narco the pain is gone; but still can't seem to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I am 27 years old and just ready to get these cysts out of me!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, in the very least its nice to have a place vent fear and frustration.",
