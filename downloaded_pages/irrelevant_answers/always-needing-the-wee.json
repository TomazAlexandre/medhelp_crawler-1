    "question": "hiim 16 years old and for about the last 4 months i have had the constant urge to go to the toilet.i have been to the doctors over 6 times with the problem now and still nothing has changed.at first the doc said that i could have an infection, so after taking 3 different types of tabletsnothing had happened and the doc said it was not that. they sent me to a hospital and i had a ultrasoundtest done on my lower stomach IE kidneys bladder etc. That came back good so the doctor saidit most probably is \" Overactive bladder syndrome \" . He gave me more tablets called. \" Tolterodine \"and said that the problem should go away in around 1-2 weeks. ( not go away just make me not feel like i needthe toilet ). I have now been on the tablets for 1 month and still the same as what is was. i am now very veryworried as i cant seem to go anywhere or do anything without worrying. The doc said it has a 75% of being \"Overactive bladder syndrome \" as when my mind is taken off the idea of needing the toilet i am fine and cango for 4+ hours without needing to go. Only problem is that i don't feel i got a bladder problem as when i goit feels like i need to go again from my penis. so could this mean i have a penis problem??.\u00a0\u00a0i have also noticedthat for about the last month i get very numb testicles . could this be linked?? my parents also told me thata reason for needing the toilet allot can be stress , and i do suffer from stress as when i was about 13-15 i sufferedfrom hair loss because of stress :( please help me.",
