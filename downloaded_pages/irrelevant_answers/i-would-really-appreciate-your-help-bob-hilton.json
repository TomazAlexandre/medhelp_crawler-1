            "answer": "You are welcome, I hope I could offer a real helpThough, I understand your frustration about the burning sensation, but I often focus on the unusuals...so many times I did catch the diagnosis this way!!You are only 25 and not overweight, so why on earth to develop a cervical multilevel disc buldge? I know its been reported in the letreture as young as 20 years , but for the lumbar spine and the obese patients.Let me tell a brief about the physiology why do we get disc disease?As almost so many diseases, its said \"Symptomatic disc disease is multifactorial\" . But definately disc degeneration occurs with the dehydrating process of aging, thickened ligament, cartilage, and bony spur + may be hereditary and dietary factors which are not clear yet.In addition , we know that\u00a0\u00a0neurologic findings are related to the developmental size of the spinal canal(some of us, are lucky,\u00a0\u00a0have wide canal and others a narrow ones) I'm not sure what is the case with you? and what is the scope with the lower back pain?Back to the burning sensation which did not show any thing on exam which mean we are almost talking about a possible small fiber neuropathy1- To rule out diabetes you have to do the glucose tolerance test the old way its better than just a random venous sampling!! and better than the fancy ones like Hbg A1C or fructosamine!!2- Do fasting Triglyceride level (part of the lipid profile)3- Make sure you are not on a suplement for growing a better scalp hair which may contain big doses of Vitamine B6!4- If the B12 is in the low normal level you will need to do Homocystein, methylmalonic acid level to confirm.5- worth doing serum Copper level , albumin, calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus6- Celiac disease is hard to diagnose when its mild , but easy to treat by having Glutin free diet for a couple of months and see\u00a0\u00a0(please see my full comment for Angela,ahoskm )7- if any new symptomes of lightheadeness, constipation, bulky diarhea, GERD), dry private secretions should be mentioned to your doctor as its all pointing to further evidence of a small fiber neuropathy and a refferal to a specialized center to do quatitative mesures are advisableBack to the multilevel cervical discs, and the lower back which will need neuroimaging to put a plan to prevent and treat them\u00a0\u00a0e.g postural education, range of motion and isometric muscular toning, and adaptation of the workstation to allow a neutral, unstressed posture...extBest of luckBob",
