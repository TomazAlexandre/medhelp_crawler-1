            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum. I am happy to address your questions, and my answer will be based on the information you provided here. Please make sure you recognize that this forum is for educational purposes only, and it does not substitute for a formal office visit with a doctor.Without the ability to examine and obtain a history, I cannot tell you what the exact cause of the symptoms is. However I will try to provide you with some useful information.The presence of white matter lesions on MRI can be caused by many different disease processes.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes they appear as we age due to what is known as small vessel ischemic disease, and are more common in people with vascular risk factors such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Multiple Sclerosis can also cause white matter lesions, and we look at the distribution of the lesions for clues that help us determine the probability of MS.MS is an inflammatory demyelinating disease that affects the central nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms may be mild to severe, ranging from tingling and numbness to paralysis. There is not one test alone or one symptom that can diagnose MS, but there are well-established criteria that help neurologists make the diagnosis. These include performing a thorough history and physical exam, looking closely at the MRI imaging of the brain (and possibly spine), and sometimes pursuing ancillary testing such as lumbar puncture and evoked potentials.With the left sided burning and weakness that you described in your left arm, MS should be ruled out, and if you have not already done so, I would recommend seeking a neurologist for a formal evaluation.Thank you for this opportunity to answer your questions, I hope you find the information I have provided useful, good luck.",

    "question": "Dear doctor could you\u00a0\u00a0please explain my MRI result which says multiple white matter lesions extending into the subcortex bi-hemispherical.\u00a0\u00a0Findings in the first place suggestive of demyelination.\u00a0\u00a0Differential diagnosis would be microemboli.\u00a0\u00a0I had the MRI scan due to headaches and left sided burning and weakness in my left arm. Many thanks.",
