            "answer": "wow your monitors must be very different from the ones here in the U.S. if i had a glucose reading on our monitors here of 5.4 i would be unconcious.....possibly on my way (if not there) to being dead.normal range on a U.S. monitor (if i remember correctly) is 70-110.\u00a0\u00a0a fasting low should be maybe a little lower but if you get much below 60 you'll know it. it is one of the worst feelings i have ever had the misfortune of having to experience.~nanci",

    "question": "I went for my visit with the dietican today. The foods really are not that restricted. Just have to watch the amounts. I ate 2 peices of low carb toast and an egg this morning when I got up. When I got there she showed me how to take my reading and it was 75. That was 2 1/2 hours after eating. I have taken it twice after dinner just out of curiousity and it was 89 1 hour after lunch. I took it again about 45 minutes ago and it was 85. Do these reading sound normal to anyone how has knowledge about diabetes? The finger sticking does not hurt at all! I was very suprised and happy! At least I only have to deal with it for another 10 weeks!",
