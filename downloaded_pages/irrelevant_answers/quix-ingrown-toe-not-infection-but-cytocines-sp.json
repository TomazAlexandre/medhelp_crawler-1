    "question": "My new podiatrist that I saw this afternoon told me that my ingrown toe wasn't infected, that it was a inflammatory reaction of the body trying to push out a foreign body, kind of like an ingrown hair.\u00a0\u00a0It still produces pus, but is not a true infection.I asked why it would then cause my MS symptoms to flare up, and he responded that the inflammatory reaction releases cytocines, which MS reacts to in the same way that it would an infection.\u00a0\u00a0He said that if left untreated, it could become infected with staph.\u00a0\u00a0I asked why my neuro was concerned about cellulitis, and he said that it could come to that if infected and left untreated, more likely seen in people with diabetes.I said, hmmmm.I aparently have a \"tabletop\" toenail; flat, then angles down sharply.\u00a0\u00a0The problem would happen again if left alone, and he offered a choice of procedures, one slightly better than the other.\u00a0\u00a0I asked if it was billed under a surgical code, which he had his assistant check for me.\u00a0\u00a0The answer was \"unsure\".I explained my financial situation and my insurance co-pays going way up for such things.\u00a0\u00a0He said \"Let me take a look, see if I can't make things bettter without going to that extreme\".\u00a0\u00a0He clipped out the tissue left over from the inflammatory experience, pointing out where my toenail pierced the skin.\u00a0\u00a0He bought me some time to research more options, like would it be worth upgrading to the enhanced insurance policy.So, my question is, do I or don't I ask for antibiotics if my toe gets another pus pocket?\u00a0\u00a0Should I look into getting the procedure done (cutting the \"leg\" off the \"table\" so to speak) to keep from having this inflammation from kicking my a$$ again?\u00a0\u00a0My toe hurts, by the way.\u00a0\u00a0Hope it doesn't get inflamed again!Thanks,Kathy",
