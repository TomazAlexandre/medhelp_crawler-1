            "answer": "Hi TomKal,Like you, I've been diabetic a long time.\u00a0\u00a0I admire your lifelong commitment to regular exercise.\u00a0\u00a0It's an aspect of my treatment I can't say I've been good at.\u00a0\u00a0Seems that you're raising two important issues:\u00a0\u00a0(1) the harrowing commute and the impact on your BG (for many DMers, stresses causes highs, not lows -- but some do experience lows from it) and (2) the loss of your regular bicycle exercise commute.I agree that the loss of a stress-reducing activity PLUS the addition of a stress-inducing activity is a lot take every single day.Perhaps an approach to your ability to get regular exercise is to work with your manager and/or HR folks to allow you to have/store a bicycle securely at your workplace.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps then you can get some riding in many days during lunch time.Many organizations also encourage carpooling, and some of your co-workers might really treasure a carpool-mate to help defray the cost of gas.\u00a0\u00a0Might your manager and/or your HR folks help you find some folks who commute from your part of town?Finally, many organizations will allow employees to work a flex schedule in order to miss the rush hour.\u00a0\u00a0For example, early birds might arrive at work (and also leave for home) 1-2 hours earlier.\u00a0\u00a0Night owls might arrive (and leave) 1-2 hours later.I'm sure others'll have some ideas -- gotta be thinkin' outside the box, here ... Good luck and keep taking great care of you!",

            "answer": "Dear TomKal,Thank you so much for reaching out to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. While I am not a doctor and cannot give you medical advice, I can give you my life experience as a mom with a 27 year son, who was diagnosed at 8.I do understand your frustration. It is such a shame that people know so much about anxiety attacks, but not diabetes? I watched a teacher's eyes glaze over when I was trying to explain type 1 to her.I do think that you have hit the nail on the head. Your comment that anxiety is creating symptoms of hypoglycemia and lead to more anxiety, is in my personal opinion, true. It is a double-edged sword. I do not have diabetes, but have been treated for a panic disorder in the past,(driving). I found that the more I fought the attack, the stronger it became. I believe we can talk ourselves into one. I would recommend that you talk to your doctor again see if he knows anyone who deals with type 1 diabetes and anxiety or depression. My son found such success with this approach.I might also suggest that you go to www.jdrf.org and click on ODST (Online Diabetes Support Team) This is a one on one, where volunteers dealing with the same issues can give a more ongoing dialogue. Please watch for other comments on this thread. This is a great forum.I would like to know how you are doing. Please keep in touch and best wishes.dm",

            "answer": "Hi Tom.I have to commute to work 40 miles each way through some nasty traffic and construction and am able to do it without adverse BG issues (they sit in the upper 80/mid 90 range).The trick is you have to get into a \"relaxed\" driving mindset.\u00a0\u00a0No road rage.\u00a0\u00a0If the guy wants to speed past you because you're doing the Speed Limit and he wants to do 120 in his Porsche - let him.\u00a0\u00a0If a woman in an SUV the size of your first house didn't move over 2 miles back because her lane ahead is closed due to construction and now she is determined to merge right at the point where the orange barrels squeeze her off - let her zipper in.\u00a0\u00a0The trick is not to get upset or anxious, it's not worth the effort - I usually play a soft music during the drive in.Know your routes to work.\u00a0\u00a0Also know auxiliary routes in case you get stuck in some traffic jam.\u00a0\u00a0Keep fast acting Glucose Tabs in the glove compartment if you catch yourself feeling weak.\u00a0\u00a0And if you catch yourself getting anxious or aggitated - take three deep breaths to calm yourself down.\u00a0\u00a0Driving \"calm\" is the key.Unfortunately for me - biking is what throws my DM way off.\u00a0\u00a0:^)\u00a0\u00a0I've never found a good way to prevent myself from going low when even leisurely biking (so if you have any hints on Bike Riding and Diabetes, do post them!)And I know what you mean about Human Resources - they know nothing about Diabetes, don't care to learn anything about Diabetes, and like 90% of the non-Diabetic public (the \"15 out of 16 people\" as I like to term them) - they are still under the impression \"1 insulin shot a day cures everything\" and \"Diabetes isn't a major condition.\"",

    "question": "I can't believe I've never used this resource before as I've had Type 1 since I was 11. I'm 33 now, and except for a rough first couple years, I've had great control.One thing that made things easier for me was that since grade school I've almost always been able to ride my bike to school and later to work. I've found that the routine physical activity seems to keep my metabolism grounded. Unfortunately, my employer has moved all its offices to the suburbs while my family is rooted downtown.I was wary when I first heard of the move since I almost never drive alone. My wife acts as navigator and BG tester.So I have been driving for about a month now and things aren't good. Hitting traffic almost immediately gets my heart pumping and I sense what feels like a hypoglycemic reaction. The first couple times I just grabbed a snack, only to have my BG skyrocket. Subsequently I have pulled off to measure and I generally seem to be much higher than I would have guessed. I suspect anxiety is creating symptoms of hypoglycemia which further fuels my anxiety which is affecting control.My overall control even at home has suffered and I suspect BP is up too. I am already borderline and on a couple ACE inhibitors. I have spoken to an HR rep, but I found myself trying to explain what diabetes is. Once I mentioned the word \"anxiety\", her eyes lit up with recognition and happily announced that councellors are available. I'm afraid they still have no comprehension what the physical implications of my situation might be.Anyone with similar experiences or suggestions?-Tom",
