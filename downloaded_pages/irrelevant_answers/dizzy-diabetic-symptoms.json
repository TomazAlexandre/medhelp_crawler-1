            "answer": "Hi Mike,There are a lot of things that can cause dizziness, and certainly when you are diabestic, the ante is upped some because you are more at risk for some of them.It sounds like hypoglycemia may be an issue for you, and may be triggering some symptoms, so I would talk to your doctor about whether changing some of your meds may be appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0Also you are doing the right thing being conscious of your diet.Neurological and cardiac issues are more likely when you are diabetic too, so I think following through with the MRI or CT (whichever you have booked) and follow up with the neurologist is a good idea.\u00a0\u00a0Even though you have had a normal ECG and echo/dopplers, they won't necessarily show ischemic heart disease (which can lead to heart attack), so if you aren't getting answers you may want to speak with your PMD or cardiologist about stress testing or cardiac cath (especially because exercise triggers symptoms).The other thing that can occur in diabetes is called autonomic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I will include a link here from the National Institutes of Health that describes it in detail- this may be contributing to your problems too:http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/DM/pubs/neuropathies/As you have said, anxiety almost always will make symptoms worse, so do the best you can to not let your stress affect your health.Please make sure you follow up with your physician about this- dizziness can be a complex issue, especially in a diabetic patient.All the best, and happy holidays.JMK MD",

            "answer": "It is abnormal for people to suffer sudden hypoglycemia (you seem to present the classic whipples triad) unless you don't eat.\u00a0\u00a0Even then, the liver has glycogen reserves to break down to sugars once hypoglycemia occurs.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from seeing a cardiologist as suggested by Dr. Keyes, you should see an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0It might be a symptom of an insulinoma.",
