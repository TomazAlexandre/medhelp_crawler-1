            "answer": "Hi, there. Your B12 levels are in the low normal range since the normal levels are 200 \u2013 900 picgm/ml which should not be sufficient reason to cause the neurological symptoms that have inflicted you.\u00a0\u00a0There is a strong suspicion of multiple sclerosis that this\u00a0\u00a0needs to be investigated in detail. a lumbar puncture to check for oligoclonal bands and a repeat MRI to check for white spots or areas of demyelination of white matter is desired. Try to continue B12 supplementation under your neurologist supervision and stop alcohol if you are an alcoholic. Get your blood sugars tested for diabetes, thyroid profile to rule out hypothyroidism, RA\u00a0\u00a0factor for rheumatoid arthritis etc.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

    "question": "I have had progressive neuro symptoms for six months beginning with dizziness and imbalance issues, peripheral neuropathy and now weakness and trembling in my legs.\u00a0\u00a0I had a negative MRI-- B12 at 200, neuro strongly feels this is the cause, internist doesn't support it at all.\u00a0\u00a0Had one injection three days ago, internist will only do once a month so I am trying sublingual b12 as well.\u00a0\u00a0The injection definitely increased my energy and cleared my head (I didn't even realize it was so foggy) but my physical symptoms are still present, almost to the point where walking for very long is difficult.\u00a0\u00a0Can this all really be due to low b12, my internist insists that 200 is still low normal so I should not be having any neuro problems but neurologist feels otherwise.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms are constant and progressive and I am so concerned that it is MS and not so much b12 issues- any insight?\u00a0\u00a0Three days post injection is it normal NOT to have physical improvement (my head does feel better.)Thanks.",
