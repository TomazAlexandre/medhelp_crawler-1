            "answer": "I have GD. It's not so bad as long as you look after and moniter it and yourself. I am not insulin dependant, not too many cases are. I've had to adjust my eating habits and avoid the sugary foods. As far as I am concerned not a bad thing. My baby is measuring big, but that also has to do with my family history of big babies too. I've kept my sugar levels within range, and haven't gained much weight the whole pregnancy (6kg). I am now on the home stretch, 36 weeks my Dr is going to schedule an induction for week 38. All in all I am healthy and so is baby.Listen to the advice your given, and ask any and all questions you might have.I have experience with diabetes as my mum is a type 1 diabetic, so I didn't have many questions. Lol.As long as you look after yourself and listen to what you Dr or educator tells you to do you will be fine.",

            "answer": "I have just been diagnosed too. I had it my last pregnancy too so I kinda know what to expect. They started me on oral medication n had me change my diet. And when that didn't work I had to shoot myself with insulin. Hopefully yours can be controlled with just the medication n diet. I felt like I was starving. Then they induced me three weeks early because I also got pre eclampsia. My blood pressure was high I was swollen n they said the baby would grow better if they took him early.\u00a0\u00a0So this pregnancy like I said I just got diagnosed. But before this I had problems with my cervix shortening n dialated and they had to give me a cervical stitch. I think this is the last pregnancy for me. Take care of yourself",
