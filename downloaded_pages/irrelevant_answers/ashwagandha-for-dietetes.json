            "answer": "There are many herbs that are reputed to lower blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Many adaptogens fall into that category, but they also help with leveling energy and balancing the adrenals, which can be very helpful to even out the swings of blood sugar problems.\u00a0\u00a0There are adaptogens which have a better reputation for this than ashwagandha, but if it's working, hey, terrific.\u00a0\u00a0Look into American ginseng and holy basil, which also balance cortisol release and more directly lower blood sugar, but be careful with this kind of thing -- do it slowly whatever you try since rapid alterations can be scary for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0And they don't replace dietary changes as the most important things for Type II.\u00a0\u00a0As for dose, you can research this on the internet by just googling it, but remember, everyone's dosage will be different, and different herb companies have different potencies and speed of action.",

            "answer": "It is unfortunately not true that ashwagandha always gives extra energy.\u00a0\u00a0Adaptogens do what the body decides it wants them to do.\u00a0\u00a0Many people report becoming very tired taking ashwagandha.\u00a0\u00a0It depends on the person and the state of the person's bodily functions.\u00a0\u00a0Some adaptogens are very energizing on a regular basis, such as Chinese ginseng or rhodiola, but ashwagandha and eleuthero and American ginseng, just for three examples, can give some people energy and calm others down, possibly making them a little tired.\u00a0\u00a0That's why the latter three are often used for people suffering from anxiety. It depends on the person.\u00a0\u00a0This is why herbs are generally used in combination, to find the right mix for a particular individual.\u00a0\u00a0It's obviously a great herb for the poster, but I just wanted to add this caution so others out there know they might have a different result.\u00a0\u00a0Peace.",

            "answer": "In an animal study assessing the anxiolytic and antidepressive actions of [url=\"http://ashwagandha.tk']ashwagandha [/url] compared to commonly prescribed pharmaceuticals, an extract of the root was administered orally to rats once daily for five days. The results were compared to a group administered the benzodiazepine lorazepam for anxiolytic activity, and the tricyclic antidepressant imipramine for antidepressant investigation. Both the ashwagandha group and the lorazepam group demonstrated reduced brain levels of a marker of clinical anxiety. Ashwagandha also exhibited an antidepressant effect comparable to that induced by imipramine in the forced swim-induced \u201cbehavioral despair\u201d and \u201clearned helplessness\u201d tests. Other similar studies confirm these results, lending support to the use of ashwagandha as an antistress adaptogen.",
