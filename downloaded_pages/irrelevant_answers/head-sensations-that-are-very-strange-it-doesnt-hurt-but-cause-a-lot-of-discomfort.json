            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. In all probability you have some balance problem due to internal ear infections. You could also be having myoclonus secondary to ear infection. Another reason for the myoclonus causing head jerks/swaying sensation etc is peripheral neuropathy (diabetes, thyroid problems, lupus etc) or pinched nerve in neck (MRI or nerve conduction studies or EMGs would be diagnostic). Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I am a new member. I became interested in your site after I found this page :http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Neurology/Strange-Head-Sensation-and-symptoms---Migraine-epilepsy-something-else/show/1090924which described what I am feeling with my head right now. It happens everyday. And is causing me discomfort, worry and stress. I hope a doctor or a specialist can help. It is very hard to find a doctor here in our place.It is very hard to describe but I will try my very best. It feels like there is pressure in my head which feels like my head is swaying or tightening. Sometimes, I get lightheaded and sometimes it feels like my head is pulled back. I can feel the pressure, that part of my head becomes heavy. And sometimes it feels like my head is waving in the inside. Please do you have any idea what it is? I am very much willing to cooperate and answer additional questions about this so things will be more clearer. PLEASE HELP.",
