            "answer": "Hi!What you feel is probably pain of intermittent claudication where muscles spasm and then relax and then go into spasm again. It is commonly seen in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Another possibility is deep vein thrombosis. This can also cause pain due to poor blood supply to muscles. This can be known by dopplar studies. Cancer that has spread to bones, osteoporosis of bones, infection like osteomyelitis, or disruption of blood supply to bone as in sickle cell anemia can also be the cause. An X-ray or CT scan of the shin bone should be done. At times it can be due to a compressed spinal nerve in the lumbar area. This can be detected by nerve conduction studies and by MRI of the spine. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for the advice.\u00a0\u00a0Since I just had a physical that rules out diabetes and hypertension I guess my next step is to schedule a visit with an Orthopedic Surgeon.\u00a0\u00a0I like that I have something to refer to in asking questions - thank you again.",

    "question": "I have been dealing with this for a while now; however today it reached a boiling point.\u00a0\u00a0I get a pain so bad in my left shin that it takes my breath away.\u00a0\u00a0Today I had my son and 2 of his friends in the car with me when it hit - it scared them terribly.\u00a0\u00a0There doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason for when they occur.\u00a0\u00a0I have had them happen while relaxing with my legs propped up, riding on my motorcycle (that was a scary one), and like today, just sitting, I was about to step out of my car when it hit.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is so unbearable that it brings tears to my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0It is like being hit with a bat swung by superman right in my shin.\u00a0\u00a0The only good thing is that the visit is usually very brief; however, it seems lately that when it happens it is lasting longer, probably close to a whole minute or better today.\u00a0\u00a0I don't even know where to begin.\u00a0\u00a0Should I see an Orthopedist, or could this be a varicose vein issue, I do have some spider veins, or could it be a clot?\u00a0\u00a0I hate to run off to the doc for this but after today I am a little frightened and thinking that maybe I should.",
