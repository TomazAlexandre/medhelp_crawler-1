The type laser is different.\u00a0\u00a0So you actually have two types of diabetic disease and your eye MD believes that the maculopathy needs laser there's no need to doubt him/her.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is a progressive disease and you may well need more laser for PDR or DME in the future. Meticulous control of your diabetes (A1C less than 7.0) and keeping your BP, cholesterol, body weight, diet, exercise level and not smoking are the best ways to keep your eyes healthy. That and see an Eye MD once or twice/year.JCH MD",

            "answer": "Thank you very much for responding to my question.\u00a0\u00a0You are right, I did ask this question before, but I could not find any response, so please forgive me for asking it again.\u00a0\u00a0As I mentioned in my question, I stated that I did not have edema or lipid leakage.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you though for commenting on this, and for the fine suggestions on best ways to keep ones eyes healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Excellant!!!\u00a0\u00a0I do my best to follow each of these suggestions, even winning a prize from a diabetic talk show for having a good meal plan.\u00a0\u00a0My BP, CHO, and weight is fine, and I do not smoke.\u00a0\u00a0My A1C averages about 7.5 and I am working to lower this.However, I am a little bit confused about the last sentence of my question, wondering if one does not have neovasculization or new blood vessel growth (after recent laser treatment - about a month) and is currently inactive with the PDR, is it normal to have more laser around the vessels to dry them out so that NO blood will flow through these blood vessels, so that they will regress COMPLETELY?\u00a0\u00a0This is my specific question. Thank you for your patience!",

            "answer": "Thanks so much again for your response, and yes I realize that if one does not have PDR doesn't mean that this will always be the case, as this was something that happened in the past (once inactive, then active and treated).I still wish to know that if one is in an INACTIVE state - yes, currently inactive with the PDR, \"is it normal to have MORE laser around the vessels to dry them out completely, so that NO blood will flow through these blood vessels any time soon?\u00a0\u00a0This is still my unanswered question specifically. Once again I really do appreciate your response, but I'm not seeing how it answers the question.",

    "question": "I was told that \"more spots (laser spots/burns) may be necessary in inactive PDR due to macular edema or lipid leakage.\"\u00a0\u00a0Is this the only time more \"spots/burns\" are added, or can there be more added, such as in the case of a completed session of laser (good laser treatment) - no edema or lipid leakage, yet eye vessel breaks weeks after treatment, thus once the blood starts to clear to some degree - is it a good idea to add more laser treatment around the vessels so as to dry them out so that no blood will flow through these vessels, so that they will regress completely and not leak?",
