            "answer": "Hi no theyare not HPV symptoms and it would appear your constant looking for things like the white dots you mention your causing the itching your self by picking at the white dots causing\u00a0\u00a0and injury. Short of going to a dermatoligist for some bioseys try using some over the counter cortizone cream with aloe 1% as should help with the itching.This would have nothing to do with the oral sex you recieved a year ago.",

    "question": "I posted this a while ago with no real response. I have been trying to treat it at home with ACV but it burns and leaves scabs. I have itching/irritation on/off in the scrotum and groin areas. These symptoms don't seem to match any STI, but this was contracted from another person. Please, if anyone has any idea...Almost a year ago I received oral sex from a sex trade worker. 1-week later my penis broke out in a rash, little red bumps everywhere and my urethra burned like crazy and it was painful to urinate. I went to a doctor and was tested for STIs, all tests were negative. The doctor gave me some anti-fungal cream and steroid cream which helped to reduce the inflammation, but it never fully went away. I am left with a small pinkish-red-purple patch on my shaft which never goes away. I also tried the \"Vinegar test\" for HPV and found that some white dots appeared on my shaft, which scabbed over. Now, for the past several months I've been experiencing constant itch and irritation, sort of itchy pins and needles feeling in my scrotum, anus and thigh areas. I've tried coconut oil, lotion, changing soaps, supplements, nothing is working! Are these possible symptoms of HPV? I've read that HPV tends to clear up on it's own, but there's lots of mixed information online and no one seems to know much about this disease. It's been a almost a year (Oct 2016 - Sept 2017) why hasn't this cleared up yet? Is there ANYTHING I can try????",
