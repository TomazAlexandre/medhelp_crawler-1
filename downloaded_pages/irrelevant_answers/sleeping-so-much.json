This sleep disorder is characterized by excessive day time sleepiness, sleep paralysis, cataplexy where the person has episodes of loss of muscle function while awake, hypnogogic hallucinations and automatic behavior. Sometimes other sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea and restless leg syndrome cause inadequate sleep leading to fatigue and daytime sleepiness.You will need to consult your primary care physician, who may schedule you for a polysomnogram (sleep test) to rule out sleep disorders and initiate appropriate therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello,I understand that sleep disorders have been ruled out and that provigil is not helping with sleepiness. What about other metabolic disorders like Hypothyroidism and Diabetes Mellitus? have they been ruled out. You can also try to keep yourself awake by engaging in activities which require alertness like puzzles, this may slowly help to overcome sleepiness voluntarily.Take Care.",
