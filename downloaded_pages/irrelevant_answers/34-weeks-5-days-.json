            "answer": "I have severe edema, marginally high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, ketones in my urine, and baby is measuring more than two weeks ahead. I'm 36 weeks and we aren't even discussing induction. There's no way a doctor will induce you at 35 weeks unless your life or your baby's life is in danger.The brain of a baby born at 35 weeks weighs only 2/3 as much as the brain of a baby born at 39 weeks. The last month is very very important.",
