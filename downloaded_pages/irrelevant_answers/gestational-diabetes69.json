            "answer": "Your ob will ask you to talk to a dietitian.\u00a0\u00a0They will come up with a diet for you to follow closely.\u00a0\u00a0They will teach you how to use a glucose machine. ( pricking your finger and testing your blood sugar ) as long as you control your diet and keep your sugar levels good then all will be good. If diet and exercise doesn't work they will send you to a diabetes doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I controlled it very well.\u00a0\u00a0This is my second pregnancy and my sugars were too high for fasting so they put me on metformin and I'm doing great. I don't have regular diabetes so I was thrown off when I was told I'd need medicine. But when I got pregnant my body decided it didn't wanna function normally. My doctor doesn't think I'll need to keep going on the meds after I deliver. If you have any questions feel free to message me. I'll help as much as I can! Good luck.: )",
