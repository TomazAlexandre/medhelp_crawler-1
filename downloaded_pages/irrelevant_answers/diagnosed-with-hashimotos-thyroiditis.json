            "answer": "What are your TSH levels? I'm a little confused. Hashimoto's might take years to totally kill your thyroid. Until it does, you tsh will keep going up and you'll need more and more hormone. Surely your doctor doesn't want to wait that long!",

So far they are telling me that there is nothing they can give me. My GP doctor recommended B12 shots for my tiredness. I am very frustrated and I am just worn out.",

I had a sonogram done and she said it was very enlarged. Now I am wairing to here back from my doctor. What do they do about a goiter?",

            "answer": "TSH levels are normal at (.3-3.0), but a goiter means that it's working overtime to make your hormone. Wow, you've got me stumped. Maybe a T3 uptake? (Another blood test) That will see if your body is absorbing the hormone.\u00a0\u00a0Hashi people are also prone to other hormone deficiencies like estrogen. I'm sorry I don't know something useful, but in the meantime, I will say extra prayers and you keep bugging either your doc or some other doc. Love...",

            "answer": "How do I know if I have an estrogen deficiency? Maybe that is why I feel so lousy. I do not understand everything about the hashimoto's thyroiditis. If I have that then why are my other levels all normal? The only thing that has ever shown up is my antibody levels. I just do not know where to go from here? I do not know what to ask my doctor to get help.",

            "answer": "The only thing you can do is keep giving them your symptoms. I tried to go into the docs with a bunch of things that I thought I knew about the disease I thought I had and that's a good way to get things missed. I also have hypoglycemia (blood sugar) and everytime I went to the doc, all my questions were about blood sugar. I finally went to the doc with a list of my symptoms in tears and he was able to look at the bigger picture. My point is, educate yourself about hashi's, but don't close the door on other issues. If you feel that the doc isn't taking you seriously, take your symptoms to another one. I've seen others on this forum caution others to make sure you get an endo who specializes in thyroids, otherwise you'll get one who specializes in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I'm luck that my gp is so good, otherwise I'd never have gotten any help.\u00a0\u00a0I'm so sorry you're feeling this way. I wish you luck!!\u00a0\u00a0P.S. Don't be afraid of antidepressants. This is a very stressful time for you, and a little help is not a bad thing.",

    "question": "I am 25 years old and I have recently been diagnose with hasimoto's thyroiditis. My levels are normal so the doctor told me there is nothing they can do for me. They said I have to continue to get bolld tests and basically wait for my immune system to destroy my thyroid before they can give me medication. In the meantime I feel terrible almost daily. I have three small children and I can not hardly play with them due to lack of energy. I get 8 to 9 hours of sleep a night and still feel exhausted. I am irratible, forgetfull, and depressed. Is there anything I can do?",
