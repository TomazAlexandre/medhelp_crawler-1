But if you have well controlled blood sugars and can prove it, you might just have a tiny bit have a chance. Your best option would be to try and contact your local senator or congressman and see if they will\u00a0\u00a0write you a recommendation letter and see if they will \"pardon\" your medical issue. The other thing you have going against you is the Air Force is that they aren't really recruiting for pilots but you still may be able to join. Sorry to burst your bubble but all you can do is try.Bp",

    "question": "I have had Diabetes since I was 3 years old and I'm 14 now. My parents have always told me that I can be whatever I want when I grow up. I've always loved planes and flying, and I've always wanted to be a pilot in the U.S. Air Force. My parents never had the heart to tell me that I cannot be a pilot in the Air Force, and I recently figured it out and was very upset. Is there any possible way that I can get around it. Or is my dream ruined?",
