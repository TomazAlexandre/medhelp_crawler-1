            "answer": "You should not need to diet or fast... . Some people try to avoid extra sugary stuff the day before.. but its only if you fail that they sometimes require that..I ate peanut butter toast before going and i passed with flying colours...\u00a0\u00a0You will either have it or you wont, eating something small and healthy before hand wont hurt it.. Plus the drink will be rough on an empty stomach.it is not so bad..\u00a0\u00a0Keep in mind that most people who have gestational diabetes are fine.. many get to just balance it with a diet change, others use insulin.. It would be the rare case to lose your baby because of it...Dont stress yourself out until you know the results..",
