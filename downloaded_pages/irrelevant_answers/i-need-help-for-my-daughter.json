            "answer": "Hi Susan.Welcome to the forum.You have to rule out Bartonelliosis.If she did not get the Bartonella henselae test yet, it should be done ASAP!She has a predisposition of\u00a0\u00a0serious complications from this possible infection,as her immune system seems to be compromised from before.High eosinophil count is consistent with some of her symptoms andher suspected Bartonelliosis infection, also known as cat scratch disease.There are other possibilities like Lyme Disease and Lupus, however, diagnosing these accurately may take years. A single negative test for Lupus is usually NOT a final determination. If you need more info pleasepost at the Lupus and Lyme disease Communities.The diagnostic criteria are complex, the presentation of these diseasespresenting a huge challenge to Doctors and patients alike, and on top of this there are many controversies with the governing health authoritiesregarding these diseases.Should you have any more questions, please post again or pm me directly.Your daughter deserves to have a better and healthier life .If we can help her take a direction towards this, then it is a blessing for all!God Bless!Niko",

    "question": "I am a mom that needs some answers regarding my daughter's health.\u00a0\u00a0She is 22, diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at age 18 (several weeks after a Hep B vaccine), and Hashimoto's 2 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Her symptoms of chronic cough, nausea, throwing up, acid reflux, hair loss, trouble concentrating, low grade fever, back pain, stiff neck, fatigue, scalp sores, HIGH EOSINOPHIL COUNT, hearing loss, etc. continue to worsen.\u00a0\u00a0I am desperate for answers. She had a test for Lupus and it was negative, but her eosinophil count was extremely high. I have no idea if this is related to her other autoimmune disorders, but I thought this was a good place to start.\u00a0\u00a0Another thing.....these symptoms began around a year ago, which was about the same time she got a cat from the humane society.\u00a0\u00a0This is her 4th cat, and she had no symptoms with the first 3. I even took the cat with me for a month, but she continued to have the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Please help",
