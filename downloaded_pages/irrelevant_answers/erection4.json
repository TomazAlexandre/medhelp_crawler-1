            "answer": "Hi,'Erectile dysfunction, sometimes called \"impotence,\" is the repeated inability to get or keep an erection firm enough for sexual intercourse. Erectile dysfunction, or ED, can be a total inability to achieve erection, an inconsistent ability to do so, or a tendency to sustain only brief erections.''The etiology of ED is usually multifactorial. Organic, physiologic, endocrine, and psychogenic factors are involved in the ability to obtain and maintain erections. In general, ED is divided into organic and psychogenic impotence, but most men with organic etiologies usually have an associated psychogenic component. ''Diseases such as diabetes, kidney disease, chronic alcoholism, multiple sclerosis, atherosclerosis, vascular disease, and neurologic disease account for about 70 percent of ED cases.Smoking, being overweight, and avoiding exercise are possible causes of ED.Also, surgery (especially radical prostate and bladder surgery for cancer) can injure nerves and arteries near the penis, causing ED. Injury to the penis, spinal cord, prostate, bladder, and pelvis can lead to ED by harming nerves, smooth muscles, arteries, and fibrous tissues of the corpora cavernosa.In addition, many common medicines blood pressure drugs, antihistamines, antidepressants, tranquilizers, appetite suppressants, and cimetidine (an ulcer drug) can produce ED as a side effect.'You could read more about this at the following links -http://www.emedicine.com/MED/topic3023.htmandhttp://kidney.niddk.nih.gov/kudiseases/pubs/impotence/index.htmLet us know if you need any other information.Regards.",
