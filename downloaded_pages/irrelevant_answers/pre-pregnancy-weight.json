But what u gain also depends on where you started, if u were considered underweight, on target or over weight. If your dr. Isn't stating you are gaining too much, then I wouldn't worry.Also, GD happens because of how ur body handles the insulin it produces while u r pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy and the baby can actually block the insulin you produce.",
