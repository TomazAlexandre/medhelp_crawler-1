There are some countries that use a different measurement for blood sugar - if you see small numbers for blood sugar just multiply to get your numbers. I'm in the U.S. and we use the same as you do.Yes, there are some great resources on the net. I'm not allowed to put them here, so I'll send you a PM.",
