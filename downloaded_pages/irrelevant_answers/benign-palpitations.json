            "answer": "I am a 44 y/o female that have a long hx of palpitations with no medicine.For the past 6 mons I have had an increase in them. Been to the ER 7 or 8 times this year with severe case\u00a0\u00a0palpitations and light headedness only to be sent home with a dx of palpitations and to f/u with PCP who put me on meds for anxiety which I stopped taking because they made me very sick.I saw a Cardiologist and had Echocardiogram/Tread mill stress/Tilt table and some labs and they were all normal.I get them worse during exercise and have to stop and it takes about 30 minutes to recover.I also get light headed along with the palpitations sometimes.I am not on any meds.No HBP, diabetes, elevated cholesterol, or any other diagnosis.I know I am not suffering from anxiety and there has been no change in my life. I am not stressed, dont take anything with caffeine.What could this be? I have no other medical problems. I also wore the monitor for 30 days-negative.Could it be hormonal? I can be laying down in bed and it will happen.Sometimes I have numbness and tingling in my left arm and left leg and foot. On several occasions, my legs felt very heavy like logs and I could barely lift them to walk. EKGS at ER have all been normal.Please shed some insight.Thank you all",

    "question": "My heart doctor dx me with benign palpitations in Feb 06, never had any heart problems before. Had all the test done, everything came back with no problems with my heart.\u00a0\u00a0Wore a holter monitor for a month. My question is how can a cardiologist determine that palpitations are benign, and not something worse?\u00a0\u00a0I am learning to live with these stupid things. I have read previous posting regarding pvc's and this site has really helped me.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much.",
