    "question": "Anyone out there with Type 1 diabetes taking Tecfidera? I have heard from a couple of people that it causes your blood sugar to go low. I'd like to know how low, and esp. if you're using an insulin pump, how much you've had to adjust it. Also when it goes low. I'll be starting Tecfidera on September 1.",
