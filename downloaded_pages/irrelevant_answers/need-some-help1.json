            "answer": "ok, since february I have been experiencing blurry vision, dry mouth especially when I wake up in the morning, receding gums, weight loss, eatting like a pig and not gaining weight, lightheadedness, dizzy, losing the moons in my fingernails and it looks like I have what they call terrys nails, constipation but when I do go it's loose stool, frequant urination, feeling weak and tired all the time even after a good nights sleep. I have been in the hospital 3 times with cbc done each time and the 2nd time my blood glu was 117 and that was taken in the morning before I ate or drank anything, think I had just a bottle of water. Those are my symptoms. Oh yea and memory loss and lack of concentration.",

            "answer": "Those symptoms certainly could be diabetes. You don't say if you are normal weight or overweight. 117 for a fasting blood sugar is considered pre-diabetes. Generally type 1's have higher numbers than that, but it could be caught early or it could be type 2. You also want to get your thyroid checked. I would start with your primary care physician and share all your symptoms and have him assess what could be going on.",

            "answer": "I'm by far not over weight. I used to weigh an average of 145-150 now I weigh 130, and I read that type 2 you have to be over weight to get it also you gain weight with type 2. My mother was diagnosed with type 2 like 4 years ago.",

            "answer": "Many type 2's are overweight, but not all. I couldn't say what type you are, you really need to have a doctor do that. 117 is definitely prediabetes, and type 1 usually comes on faster than that. But see a doctor, have an A1C done and to clarify your type he would do antibody testing (type 1 is an autoimmune disease and type 2 is not) as well as c-peptide to see how much insulin you are producing.",

            "answer": "Also puzzling. Diabetic neuropathy (numbness)\u00a0\u00a0is usually caused by consistently high numbers over a period of time which your 117 is definitely not. The only thing that would explain your symptoms if it that 117 fasting is your low point and you are having high spikes after meals. I would reduce your carb intake. But again, I strongly encourage you to be worked up by a doctor. Boards like this (and ones with a lot more experienced diabetics) can be very useful AFTER you have been diagnosed and started on treatment, but first you need to have a doctor figure out what is going on. We can theorize all we want on here, but it's all just that...theories!",
