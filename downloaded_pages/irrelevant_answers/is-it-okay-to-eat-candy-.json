            "answer": "A little bit of sugar is not going to hurt anything.\u00a0\u00a0If by \"candy\" you mean one piece a day, and you aren't also getting a lot of other sweets in your diet (such as drinking Coke all the time or eating a lot of dessert), you're doing fine.\u00a0\u00a0If, on the other hand, your diet contains a lot of sugar already, and by \"candy\" you mean a candy bar a day, that is too much.\u00a0\u00a0(Babies whose moms eat a lot of sugar when they are pregnant have been shown to be more prone to get diabetes when they are older.)Anyway, check out the calories on the candy.\u00a0\u00a0I think a Snickers bar is 250 calories by itself (one-eighth of your calories allowed for a day).\u00a0\u00a0Plan accordingly.",
