            "answer": "Do you know which drugs you will be taking? Are you going to be taking Incivek?If I were you, I would discuss my concerns with my doctor. I don't think the rash would be worse because you have diabetes. The problem you could run into if you get a very severe rash or if your doctor does not know how to treat the rash, is that you could get excoriations from scratching and these may take longer to heal due to the diabetes. However, in most cases, if the rash is treated immediately, appropriately, and aggressively with prescription strength antihistamines and steroid creams and ointments, then the rash will generally be controlled and you should not get excoriations from scratching. You may want to make sure that you will be able to get in to see a Dermatologist right away if you get a rash so that the appropriate prescription medications can be prescribed to control any rash you may get. (I used prescription Hydroxyzine 50 mg every 6 hours orally, and also topical steroids such as fluocinonide ointment for the body, clobetesol solution for the scalp, and hydrocortisone valerate for my face, all prescriptions).Not everyone gets a rash so you may not get one.Best of luck.",
