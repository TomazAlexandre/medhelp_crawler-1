            "answer": "You will get differing opinions about this. Most cardiologists would recommend avoiding another pregnancy, as the cardiomyopathy could occur again. However, women who have had peripartum cardiomyopathy, with normalization of heart function subsequently, have gotten pregnant again successfully. Still, most cardiologists would not endorse this approach.",

However, any large medical center that has cardiac transplant capabilities, as well as high-risk OB facilities, would have cardiologists who specialize in heart failure.",

    "question": "I would like to ask a question pertaining to subsequent births and cardiomyopathy. Nearly 3 years ago, my wife had a nearly uneventful pregnancy, other than a mild case of Gestational Diabetes and UTI. Following the delivery, she experienced SOB and significant swelling. She was admitted into ICU overnight and later to the OB floor and started on Lasix and Digoxin. Dx. Postpartum Cardiomyopathy. Her EF was around 22%. After 3 days in the hospital she was released home on Lasix, Digoxin, and Norvasc. Over the next few months her EF returned to normal, and within the year she was off of her Digoxin, and Norvasc and later Lasix. Her Dr. feels that because she has done so well and without complications, that there maybe a chance that with close monitoring that a subsequent pregnancy may occur. My question is, with second evaluation and opion of course, do you feel that a subsequent pregnancy would be safe?",
