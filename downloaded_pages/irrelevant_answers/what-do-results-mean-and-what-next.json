            "answer": "Thyroiditis usually has decreased vascularity w/ exception of early stages of hashimoto's thyroiditis -- check thyroid antibodies -- any thyroiditis will cause the inhomogeneous echotexture and the reactive appearing lymph nodes.\u00a0\u00a0The nodules are small, but depending on their appearance may need FNA.\u00a0\u00a0The TSH is normal and there is no urgency based on what you describe (besides wanting more answers) - so waiting 3 months is annoying but probably reasonable.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the peace of mind.\u00a0\u00a0My PCP said that I had Hashimoto's in 97, but said the antibody screen was negative.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing abnormal with my labs recently was my fasting sugar level was a little elevated.\u00a0\u00a0With a family history of diabetes, I am watching my weight and what I eat.\u00a0\u00a0Would Hashimotos cause issues with blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible to have Hashimotos and not have antibodies?\u00a0\u00a0Would increasing my meds or trying a different med help reduce the gland/nodule size?\u00a0\u00a0After 10 yrs of being on the same thyroid med, does it ever become ineffective?I had a DVT in my leg and was dx with hereditary factor V defic. last year and had to take coumadin for 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0I am now on a daily dose of aspirin. It seems the issue with my thyroid started after going off the birth control and taking the blood thinners.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts on if it all might be related?",

    "question": "32 yrs old, dx w/hypothyroidism\u00a0\u00a01997. See pcp for annual labs, taking 75mcg synthroid. Most recent labs TSH 1.62\u00a0\u00a011/2006\u00a0\u00a0and\u00a0\u00a0TSH 1.53\u00a0\u00a0Free T4 1.10 11/2005.\u00a0\u00a0Sonogram 3/97 showed mod enlargement, right lobe 5.4cm with trans 2.3cm and left lobe 4.6cm w/ trans 2.4cm generalized inhomogeneous exho-texture compatible with goiter, uptake 3hr=9.5% and 24 hr 25.7%. The past year thyroid appears to be larger and experiencing symptoms-sluggishness, pressure when swallowing, headaches, swollen glands in neck, chronic sore throat and occassional hoarseness.ENT requested US. Results: Thyroid enlarged bilat and demos hetero echotexture, multiple hypoechoic foci.\u00a0\u00a0Isthmus shows hetero echotexture.\u00a0\u00a0Right lobe- 2.4 cm APx 3cm trans x 5.3cm long, no dominant mass lesions noted Left lobe- 2.6cm AP x 2.3cm trans x 5.9cm long, hetero parenchyma noted, 2 hypoechoic thyroid nodules- one superior portion 0.7cm AP x 0.9cm trans x 1cm long and one medial nodule 0.9cm AP x 1cm trans x 0.9cm long. Multiple cervical lymph nodes normal in appearance-0.9cm AP x 1.6cm trans x 1.8cm long.\u00a0\u00a0color doppler shows increased parenchymal blood flow to thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Impression: diffusely enlarged and hetero parenchyma thyroid gland w/increased vascularity suggestive of thyroiditis. ENT suggested Endo spec, first avail. appt in 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0The ENT is sending results and requesting an earlier appt.\u00a0\u00a0Please give me your impression of the results and what you think I can expect as follow-up treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned by the delay in seeing the Endo?\u00a0\u00a0I am a little worried at this point and don't have a clue about what these results really mean other than my thyroid is larger than it was in 1997.\u00a0\u00a0I would greatly appreciate any explanation and suggestions you might have.",
