            "answer": "Did you look into Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) or have bloodwork done for the Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV)?The migraines may be a problem in and of themselves, while the drowsiness, sore throat, and low temperature could be the result of another problem--like transient thyroiditis. How long have these symptoms been ongoing? Have you seen a doctor yet? What bloodwork/test have been done thus far?",
