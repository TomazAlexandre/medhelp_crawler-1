I went back to have it re-tested and it was only 1 enzyme to high, they told me that could be cause by any medicine i was taking like tylenol.I had a hunch that i may be diatbetic, since diabetes runs in my family.\u00a0\u00a0My father is a diabetic, so i borrowed his glucose meter and tested my blood sugar right after i woke up and after i ate, and it was normal.Everyone in my family that has this condition basically has the same symptoms as myself. There is some history of mental disorders that run in the family like, Depression, and anxiety.",

I have been dealing with this all 21 years of my life, so i have absolutly no idea what it's like to live even a somewhat normal life. The last thing i want to do is commit suicide since i love life, but one person can only take so much and i've been at that breaking point for some time now.\u00a0\u00a0I've been thinking, Why should i spend my life dealing with this hell, with little hope that i will ever find out whats wrong with me. when i could very easily just OD on sleeping pills and peacefully expire, and then all my suffering will be over.",

            "answer": "You have made an important observation:\u00a0\u00a0that this occurs every time you have a job. You also say that your job is a musician and you don't have insurance.\u00a0\u00a0Three things occur to me - and they are not mutually exclusive.\u00a0\u00a0The first is something related to the ears.\u00a0\u00a0Inner ear problems can caused spacy,out of balance feelings, and since you do not have insurance, you probably have not had good ear protection made for you, which agravate the ear problems.\u00a0\u00a0Many places will test your hearing for free or next to nothing, but if you actually have problems skip the sales pitches and go to an audiologist. Smokey environments will add to the problem.. It can lead to many of your other symptoms. If not insurance, and if you have had earaches,\u00a0\u00a0use some kind of ear plugs and look up xylitol and ear infections.\u00a0\u00a0The second is allergies. which may tie into the first.\u00a0\u00a0In me, some allergies will leave me extremely fatigued and very thirsty - in fact it once led to testing in a hospital for diabites.\u00a0\u00a0Look carefully at your environment when this has occured - do you eat differently, around peanuts more, violin rosin , latex, makeup - with me it was a \"safe\" bug spray used by my employer.\u00a0\u00a0The third is anxiety - low cost treatments for this until you have insurance include breathing exercises, tai chi, meditation, something like knitting, and inositol which can be bought through many health food store.\u00a0\u00a0In research studies they used 18 gm/day, but we have found it is effective in much lower doses. Try a spoonful or capsule in the morning, and another at night, and some just before performing.\u00a0\u00a0A bonus is that it is sweet like sugar and completely safe.\u00a0\u00a0It is likely to help with the anxiety, even if there is another problem.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.The drip",

The symptoms include, Extreme fatigue, a feeling of spaciness like being in a dream feeling like nothing around you is real, A constant feeling of dehydration even after drinking large amounts of water all day long, Difficulty concentrating, Insomnia, Depression, Anxiety.When this occurs it usually lasts for long periods of time, many months.\u00a0\u00a0I have had this happen to me everytime i have ever had a job.\u00a0\u00a0When it happens i cannot function, i am forced to stay completely in the house.\u00a0\u00a0Due to the spacy feeling, im not able to talk to or be around anyone. My mother, brother, and other family members have this same condition. As far as i know (CFS) is not genetic.I have been told that i have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).\u00a0\u00a0However I do not believe i do, i have done much research and i dont have half the symptoms that are listed for CFS. After doing further research i came across a heart condition called Mitrol Valve Prolapse Syndrome (MVP).\u00a0\u00a0I have read that this condition sometimes gets diagnosed as (CFS).\u00a0\u00a0I do occasionally expierience chest pains lasting for only a few moments which feels like sharp zipping pains going through the heart.\u00a0\u00a0I also expierience some shortness of breathe. I dont quite have all the symptoms of this condition either.Im hoping that i may be able get some insight as to what may be wrong with me, Thank you.",
