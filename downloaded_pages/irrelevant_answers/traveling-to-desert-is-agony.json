            "answer": "\"Do I need to get tested again? \"Since this is a diabetes forum I'm assuming getting a follow up A1c test again is what you're asking. I say this because you went from diabetes to osteoarthritis, body pain, and finished your post on rheumatoid arthritis.If diabetes is your concern you can always test your glucose at home with a home meter. Home A1c test kits are available too but their accuracy has not been fully proven to my liking to where I can trust their results. For an A1c, I prefer going to my docs office and getting the test performed by a professional lab.",

    "question": "We\u00a0\u00a0live in Northern Nevada at 5000 feet of elevation and in high desert.\u00a0\u00a0I find I can travel to 100 feet above sea level in California, where it's moister, but that traveling to Southern Nevada (Vegas, etc) is pure agony.I have pretty well controlled diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My last A1c was 6.1 and I eat carefully and while I'm heavy, I'm losing weight. (A dress size in 2 months)I have a moderate amount of osteoarthritis in my knee, but the pain I experience with travels to the desert in the south at lower eleveation includes hands, feet, hips, knees and excrutiating.\u00a0\u00a0A soak in a hot tub often relieves it substantially.My maternal side of the family has a long history of rheumatoid arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0Do I need to get tested again?Thanks,MarvelA",
