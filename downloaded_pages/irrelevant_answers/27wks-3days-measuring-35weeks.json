            "answer": "At 28 weeks I measured up 33 weeks and I am certain about my dates as far as last period I even know the date I had unprotected sex the ONLY date & I did not have gestational dibeties. The doctors changed my due date so now I am due 3 weeks earlier then before. I'm not sure why. They said my baby was huge at 28 weeks but now they are saying he isn't, Sometimes I think the doctors don't know so they tell you anything. Good luck :)",

            "answer": "I would say that the light spotting that you had in may was either implantaion or a breakthrough bleed, which can happenalot and throw people off because they just think it was an unusually light or weird period, but all the while they're pregnant, this usually happens due to hormones, not enough to stop a small period like bleed but enough to keep the pregnancy viable :)",

    "question": "Okay ladies,\u00a0\u00a0i need some advice here!!at 25 wks i was measuring 31wks fundaly,\u00a0\u00a0they had me take the 1hr glucose and i passed with flying colors.I had my 27wk appt Friday and i was measuring 35wks fundally.I am overweight to begin with, but I have only gained 5lbs so far with this pregnancy.I switched Dr's at 12 weeks so I could deliver at the hospital closest to my house.\u00a0\u00a0Every ultrasound that I have had the baby has measured 3-4 weeks ahead but they havent changed my due date.I go in Monday morning for a growth ultrasound and the Dr is talking about changing my due date by almost 5 weeksHas this happened to anyone else??I was not sure of my LMP so the 1st dr's office did a dating ultrasound,\u00a0\u00a0I have been saying from the beginning that they it was wrong!\u00a0\u00a0I spotted for a few day's in May but it wasnt a \"normal\" period for me.\u00a0\u00a0and I am pretty sure I got my period sometime between 15th and the 20th of April. If I am right that would put me at being 31-32 weeks pregnant nowwhich I think would make more sence considering how big i am measuring.\u00a0\u00a0I know the measurements can be off by 2weeks in either directionBut to be measuring that far ahead??\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0We will know more on Monday but the more I have been thinking about it the more strange it sounds to be so far aheadThanks for reading my novelKaren",
