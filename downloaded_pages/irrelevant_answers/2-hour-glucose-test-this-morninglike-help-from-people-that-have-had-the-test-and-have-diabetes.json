    "question": "Hello everyone!I'm a 27 year old female, in good health, exercise, diet, lots water, etcMy doctor ordered a 2 hour glucose test that I took this morning. I have been having problems for several years, he thought either diabetes, MS, pinched nerve ect. I had three just normal sugar tests last summer that were normal, one had a very slight increase.Here's my question, if someone has diabetes, do they feel anything after they drink the drink? I never felt anything other than the nasty tast (I had orange flavor anything) I know I heard that if you are hypoglysimic you pass out, or get really bad, but does anything happen for diabetics. Do I need to worry about my test being positive",
