    "question": "My normal everyday vision seems ok. But in my both eyes I'm aware of yellow-blue cloudy areas.The 'clouds' seem to shimmer with little black dots. Then when l focus in to read say newspaper print I'm aware of small grey spots - two of which are v. close to my centre of vision. In my right eye the sports obscure the bottom half of the line thst I am reading. Recently I've been seeing all sorts of black, blue & white spots in both eyes which flash. These disturbances seem to react to light.\u00a0\u00a0Also I am experiencing a strange phenomenon where I see 'static' like a TV with bad reception - this particularly in poor light. I've had a dialated eye exam and the Retina etc. looks ok. I am\u00a0\u00a0diabetic and on medication. My Doc. thinks all this may just be 'cos of shifting Sugar & B.P., but it all seems so intense. I'm really anxious - anyone got any advice?",
