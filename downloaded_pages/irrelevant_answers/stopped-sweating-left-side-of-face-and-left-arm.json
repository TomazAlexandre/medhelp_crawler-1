            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well, a sympathetic-parasympatheic innervations defect can cause decreased sweating as in your case. Certain peripheral neuropathies like in diabetes, hypothyroidism, and Gullian Barre can also be responsible. Certain skin conditions causing harm or blockage to sweat glands too can cause this problem. History of burns and Sjogren\u2019s syndrome too should be\u00a0\u00a0looked into. Please consult a neurologist and a skin specialist.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
