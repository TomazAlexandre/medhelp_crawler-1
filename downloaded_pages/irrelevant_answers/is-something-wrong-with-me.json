            "answer": "You shoul go to the hospital. Get it checked out just to make sure that it doesn't get worse tone cause things can go wrong at any moment. For example... I was perfectly fine all year and then last march one night I got in the shower and my kidneys almost exploded in my abdomen. They were infected and I felt perfectly fine about 2 hours earlier. I don't want anythin bad to happen if you aren't sure what's going in. Best wishes",

    "question": "I am 16 years of age and have RSD. I have recently become very sick and my mom's a little worried because my sister has type 1 diabetes, my grandpa has heart disease, leukemia runs in my family, high blood pressure, and thyroid cancer. There's more but that's just the jist of it all. Over the past week and a half I've become sicker and sicker. I now sleep literally all day, and when I'm not I'm extremely tired. I am a very outgoing person and when I go out, I'm just not myself. My friends have even noticed that I've been throwing up a lot which I never do. Two times in this past week and a half, I have gotten ghostly white, no color in my lips, very hot, shaky, dizzy, and start throwing up and feel completely ill till I go to sleep. I'll fall asleep and sleep twenty four hours if you'll let me. I have asthma and have been doing my inhaler regualary but it's not helping. I will take three sips of my drink and feel like I just ran a marathon, completely out of breath. I have killer headaches and am very shaky. My ribs in my back hurt everytime I take a deep breath. Should I go to the hospital like my mom keeps asking me to do or will it blow over? Thanks.",
