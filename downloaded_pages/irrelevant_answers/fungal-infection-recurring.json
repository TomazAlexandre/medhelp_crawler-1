    "question": "Hi all, for the past 3 months I had recurring fungal llinfection on my lips.. I went to the doctor and did a lab exam so thats how i found out.. I was given itraconazole and clotrimazole, during the treatment everything was ok but five days after treatment stopped it came back.. The skin around my lips got itchy and sensitive and i noticed very small blisters that are transparent in color appear on the border of my lips and a few in my actual lip area... I am very worried why it is coming back despite the treatment... Has anyone experienced this before? I kept researching online and learned that diabetics tend to get fungal infection... I am worried that this is so in my case ... Please help me..",
