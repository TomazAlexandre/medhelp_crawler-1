            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Poor circulation can be one cause and should be eliminated by a duplex ultrasound or color dopplar if this has been happening repeatedly. If this is found to be the cause then conditions like diabetes, hypothyroidism, venous pooling due to varicose veins or deep nein thrombosis, and peripheral vascular disease will have to be ruled out.The other possibility is that you have compression of the spinal nerves in the lumbo-sacral spine region. This can happen due to overuse of the lower back as in work requiring too much of bending, lifting weight, fall on the back, overweight, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. Poor posture while sleeping, sitting on computers or jobs for a long time, uneven bed, exposure of back to cold air while sleeping can cause a discomfort for a few days. Please consult a neurologist. A MRI of the spine may be required.The best thing would be to consult a general practitioner or PCP and try and assess what is the cause of your problem. Then proper referral for concerned specialist can take things further and get you proper treatment. Hope this helps. Take care!",
