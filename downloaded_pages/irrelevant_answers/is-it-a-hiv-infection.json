    "question": "Dear Drs thanx for the great work you are doing. I\u2019m from India.During 2nd week of August I had sex with an unknown partner. After intercourse I saw my condom broken. During 2nd week of October I went to a prostitute and she gave me a oral sex without condom and had a safe protected intercourse with condom. Probably after two weeks, I started feeling thirsty and drunk more than 10-12 Liters of water everyday for nearly 10 days and simultaneously urinated frequently (large amounts as per the intake). And I always felt dryness in the mouth and by 8th or 9th of November I got a mild irritation on the inner side of the penis\u2019s foreskin. A very small area of the foreskin\u2019s tissue looked peeled. From next day onwards a white cheesy deposit started accumulating beneath the foreskin. I cleaned it and actually didn\u2019t worry about that. But after a few days I consulted a physician and on 11th November, 2008 I gave my blood samples for Diabetes (Fasting and Post Prandial tests) and HIV Combi by ECLIA.No diabetes was found and the HIV test was also non reactive (0.219). I was happy and applied Metrogyl dg gel cream on my penis head as per the advice of a physician. During application I felt burning sensation for a couple of times and then stopped it, instead applied coconut oil on the area. But after two days, I got 3 to 4 sores in the penis head and from then I am having mild nausea. Now for the past 4 days I feel feverish and developed a cold sore on the lower lip. During daytime I feel feverish often but during evenings the intensity of fever increases. I had paracetamol tablets only during night times for the past 3 days. Yesterday I took \u201cOfloaxacin+Tinidazole\u201d combination in the morning and evening as per a physician. But I didn\u2019t reveal the prostitutes part to him. But after taking the pills I felt headache.Right now I1)\tfeel feverish and its intensity increases during nights2)\tsometimes feel \u201cpricky\u201d pains in the penis head3)\tCheesy deposits on the foreskin4)\tHead ache (Is that because of the Oflox-Tinidazole combi drug?)5)\tFeeling bearable pain in the tonsil region.6)\tFeel tired sometimesI don\u2019t have any enlarged lymph nodes or diarrheaThough the HIV Combi test by ECLIA was non reactive\u2026 it was done more or less on the 30th day after exposure (Keeping in mind, the first exposure was approximately 90 days, can it be ruled out?). I am worried. Are these symptoms of HIV infection? Pls advise me.I am willing to donate. Pls help me.",
