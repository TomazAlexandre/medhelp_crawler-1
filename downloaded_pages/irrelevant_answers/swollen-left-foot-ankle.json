            "answer": "I too have had a swollen left foot, on and off now for over 30 years, but it had not bothered me for the last few. I do have diabetic neuropathy now, but not back then, also now a herniated L5, and on blood pressure medication AND have bout with fibromyalgia pain. I find it curious someone else reported being told Cymbalta would relieve this if sympathetic disorder. I recently got off Cymbalta (I was put on for fibromyalgia) and now I notice the swelling again! Also, swelling in my hands that I hadn't noticed before, but the left foot i just plain weird, and weirder still is the fact that so many also have this swelling only on the left foot! This has to have something to do with cardio blockage, but then again, why did the Cymbalta obviously help the problem? I would love a difinitive answer; so far just speculation! My foot doesn't hurt, only sowllen and \"puffy\" feeling, along with the tingle of nerupopathy I always have. It feels as tho' I'm wearing a cotton sock over the swollen foot. Again, simply weird!",

    "question": "I have the same problem, I am 27 years old 132 lbs and one day I just noticed I had a swollen foot/ankle. I went to several doctors and specialists and one really good specialist told me it was from injury and the foot never went back into relief mode. Basically my brain never told my foot that the pain is gone so my foot is still swollen. She said I can use steroids and sometimes it goes away or if that doesnt work then cymbalta which is an anti depressant and it does the job but I dont want to take any heavy duty meds like that for a swollen foot!This discussion is related to/posts/show/294253.",
