            "answer": "There has been encouraging results with daily Infergen (preferably twice daily) and Ribavirin. In the not to far future, there should be a pegylated version - I just don't know when, but it definitely isn't tomorrow.By all means run it past your doc and remember <i>daily</i> Infergen.God Bless!\u00a0\u00a0-Michael",

            "answer": "I too am a non responder to the peg and the RBV. I was free from 24 weeks until my first 3 month check. My viral load skyrocketed. I have had HCV 1a for the last 30 years but just found out 2 years ago. I just went back to the Doctor today (he gave me a rest)and he suggests that I go on the Infergen with RBV. I told him I wanted the summer off before starting this new treatment. I'm very leary because I don't want to lose my hair again and I don't want to itch again. The only good thing is I'll probably lose the 20 pounds that I put back on since I stopped the tx. I also have diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and I'm 48 going through menopause. Oh happy day.There doesn't seem to be much info on infergen. Does anyone out there know any info about it?",

    "question": "I am a 46 year old female, non responder to peglated interferon and rebetol, I read recently that there are studies showing that they are having a better success rate using infergen on non responders of the peglated interferon, is this true? And would or would it not be beneficial to discuss this with my doctor. I am a geno type 1a and had a dramatic drop in the viral load in the first 3 months of treatment but as soon as I went off the treatment my viral load jumped way up again.",
