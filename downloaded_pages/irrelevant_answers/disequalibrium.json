            "answer": "First of all, keep in mind that I am unable to diagnose you because I am unable to examine you, this forum is for educational purposes.From the symptoms and history that you have provided, I suspect that you are having equilibrium problems likely related to your headaches.\u00a0\u00a0When equilibrium problems arise, we first need to rule out more serious diseases such as multiple sclerosis, cerebellar strokes, inner ear problems, etc.\u00a0\u00a0You have related adequate testing for these conditions and nothing serious was found.\u00a0\u00a0You can also have significant equilibrium problems related to migraine headaches.\u00a0\u00a0To assess for this, I would suggest a migraine preventative medication, such as Elavil, Nadolol, or Topamax etc. that you take daily.\u00a0\u00a0After 3-4 weeks you will likely notice fewer headaches and an improvement in your imbalance.\u00a0\u00a0I would also recommend physical therapy (a specific program called vestibular rehab).\u00a0\u00a0Rare patients have such refractory headaches that they require IV infusions to break their headache cycle.\u00a0\u00a0If the preventaive medication does not work within one month, then I would suggest finding a neurologist/headache center that can offer IV medications (DHE protocol).\u00a0\u00a0I do not think that your weight is having a significant impact on your balance, but could lead to joint pain, diabetes, and over all worsened health.I hope this has been helpful.",

            "answer": "Have you tried Meclizine, A med. available without prescription from your pharmacist for the imbalance. It also sounds like you may also need a course of antibiotics to make certain it is not an inner ear infection, hope this helps.",

    "question": "I'm 36F.\u00a0\u00a0Having some problems that I just can't figure out.\u00a0\u00a0I have balance issues. When I'm walking I have the sensation I am going to fall backwards which causes me to lean slightly forward when I walk.\u00a0\u00a0If I don't do this I have those falling jerks.. you know when you are about to fall and you jerk fast to stop the falling.\u00a0\u00a0Also,when I walk I feel like once my foot is down..it's down.\u00a0\u00a0I can't move as freely as I could before.\u00a0\u00a0I am begining to think I have slight left sided weakness that may be causung this. I feel I have the strength but not the coordination. I have recently started with muscle twitches that are mostly in my legs and sometimes in my upper arms. They are usually large muscle groups..big twitches but painless. The disequalibrium started 11/05. I had a MRI which was -. Inner ear testing, lyme, lupus, rhematoid w/u and a baer. All neg. I recently went back to neuro and 2nd MRI done 2 wks ago was neg. I have gained some weight recently, could that make me off balance?\u00a0\u00a0Could this be some kind of spinal issue like disc/cord compression?\u00a0\u00a0I have a spot in my back with a numb sensation thorasic region to my right. I have had that since my son's birth in 2004. Could this be MS? I have a history of headaches which would be relieved by motrin.\u00a0\u00a0The h/a's have gotten more frequent and not as easily relieved.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't know what to do now.\u00a0\u00a0No orders from my neuro.Thanks in advance for your advice.",
