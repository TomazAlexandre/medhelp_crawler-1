            "answer": "Well, with a c section, you dont need to worry about the shoulders being wide. You would only worry about that if you were having a vaginal birth. As far as the breastfeeding goes, if your concerned about that i wouldnt be put asleep. They typically dont knock you out unless its medically necessary. Ive had 2 c sections and having a 3rd so although nerve racking, the epidural isnt that bad. It makes me more nervous but thats it. I would much rather be awake so i can see and hear my baby when she is born.",

    "question": "I am 39+3 with my second and I habe gestational diabetes with that the baby is usually a little larger and may habe wider ahouldera.\u00a0\u00a0The midwife is concerned my babys shoulders may get stuck (estimated weight 9lbs 1oz) I've never had a c section or epidural. I want to be fully asleep as I have a very strong fear of needles going in my back. My question is has anyine else been fully asleep and successfully breast fed after? I want to strictly breadt feed but with the diabetes she needs to nurse right away if I'm fully asleep she may have to wait a few mins. I'm freaking out paranoid right now lol",
