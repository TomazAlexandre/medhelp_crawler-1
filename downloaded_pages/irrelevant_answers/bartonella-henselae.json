            "answer": "Hi,How is your friend? How old is she? Are there other co-morbid conditions such as hypertension ,diabetes, immunocompromised and other conditions present? Bartonella henselae is responsible for a number of illnesses such as cat scratch disease,bacillary angiomatosis, bacteremia, endocarditis, and peliosis hepatis.\u00a0\u00a0Bacteremia, or bacteria in the blood,can cause blood poisoning, which, if untreated, can lead to multiple organ failure.Any illness caused by B. henselae can usually be completely cured with antibiotics as long as it is caught early enough. In your friend's case, it is best that you talk to her doctors about this because they are in the positions to gauge the severity of the complications and symptoms. The prognosis will depend on this. Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hi,The\u00a0\u00a0symptoms may be non-specific such as fever, malaise, and headache. Most cases of the disease will resolve on their own but in some others, this can lead to complications especially if there are underlying medical conditions present. It can also be overlooked such as from cat scratch ( for cat scratch disease). Stains, cultures and serologic testing can be done\u00a0\u00a0but may sometimes even be non-conclusive.
