            "answer": "I agree with the previous advice. It doesn't sound diabetes-related to me, for you don't mention any other typical symptoms of diabetes, and if you had been diabetic long enough for the nerves in your legs to be affected, you surely would have the typical symptoms of diabetes: thirst, fatigue and weight loss. Your problem could be some other neurological problem, and so I would advise you to see your doctor and make sure that you mention that this sensation happens when you sneeze, laugh, etc. so he knows what triggers the sensation. And if the nerves are OK, you may indeed need to see a podiatrist to see if something specific in the feet needs to be treated. We do wish you the very best!",

    "question": "I am a healthy 22 year old woman, I eat very healthy and exercise every day.\u00a0\u00a0I am not overweight (120 lbs.) and I have never had any serious health problems in my entire life.\u00a0\u00a0About 2 months ago I started getting a strong, painful tingling in the bottom of my feet whenever I would cough, sneeze, laugh, stretch, take a deep breath or other movements. I've checked everywhere for information about this symptom and the only answer I've had is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have no other symptoms of diabetes and am on no medications other than an oral contraceptive.\u00a0\u00a0Could there be anything else other that diabetes that could be making my feet tingle like this?\u00a0\u00a0I would really like to know before I see a physician.\u00a0\u00a0Any information about this would be great.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
