            "answer": "Hi,I have PCOS and we did the IUI process, which our 2nd full attempt was succesful. I gave birth when I was 36.\u00a0\u00a0We tried naturally for about a year before we were finally able to start the IUI process.\u00a0\u00a0I had to take Provera to start my period and we had to wait a few months for me to have 3 normal periods before starting the IUI process.\u00a0\u00a0The start of the IUI process for me was taking clomid for I think it was 4 days (labs done on day 3 and then before and after the injections) and then I moved onto to injections, then the IUI procedure and then the 2 week wait.\u00a0\u00a0I felt so good on the hormones, as if my body was balanced like it was when I was on the pill.Now, my close friend who also has pcos had success with clomid twice (she only took clomid) and for her third baby she didn't have to use anything.We choose to go the IUI route instead of just trying clomid by itself for several personal reasons but the main one being our insurance at the time covered most of the IUI process.Any questions feel free to ask.\u00a0\u00a0And much luck to you.Tara",

    "question": "Hello all, this is my first time to post. I am almost 38 and due to my diabetes, have not menstrated now for approx 2yrs although due to some weight loss this yr I have had 3 spontaneous periods. I have polycystic ovarian syndrome and do not seem to ovulate anymore. I was told that IVF or clomid would be a possibilty. I also found out that there is a likihood of having multiples.Does Clomid start a period?? I know it helps with ovulation. Just need to see if other PCOS non menstrating woman have had any success on Clomid.THANKS",
