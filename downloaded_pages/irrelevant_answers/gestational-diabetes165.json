            "answer": "They will send to a nutritionists. Depending on how high it is they'll either put u on insulin worse case scenario or they will have u monitor and right down your sugar every time u eat and review it at your appointments. With most women with GD they watch for the growth of ur child because they can become large babies. But all and all its not horrible. The three hour is more accurate u may not even fail so dont worry yet.",

I hardly failed the 3 hour test and the frustrating thing is my blood sugar levels have all been good! It was sooo overwhelming for me when they informed me of what I will be doing for the rest of my pregnancy(having a c section in 4 weeks) but it really isn't that bad! You can still eat whatever you want you just have to beore cautious! And just a tip to lower your blood sugar you can drink water and walk around or exercise.",

            "answer": "It really is only dangerous if you choose to ignore the fact that your body is in hormone crazy town and it may need help! It can lead to big babies, but it all depends on you and your body and which treatment they give you. I also have to test for ketones and have been having trouble with it and it can be treated with insulin or diet change thankfully since my numbers are within range(give or take 2) my doctor said they will probably add food! Woohoo more to eat lol what preggo doesn't love that???",

            "answer": "Trust me gd is easy. It goes away. Try having type 1 before during an after baby. Thats when ya gotta worry a lot. Just watch what you eat dont eat too many sweets right now. Make sure you exercise even just a 20minute walk in the evening helps a lot. Try to stay away from sodas too. The carbohydrates and sugars raise blood sugars a lot with gd and diabetes in general. Just try to think healthy and eat healthy and you should be fine",
