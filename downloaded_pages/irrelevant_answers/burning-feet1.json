            "answer": "Sounds like gout. When uric acid builds up in the body it crystallizes and gravity deposits it in the feet and less commonly, the joints. These sharp little crystals are can irritate to the point of visible swelling, warmth and redness. Organ meats and alcohol are common culprits. Your doctor can confirm this with a blood test to check your uric acid levels. Colchicine is a very effective medication for gout and the pyruvic acid in organic cherry juice helps the body to break down uric acid. Hope this helps. Well wishes to you!",
