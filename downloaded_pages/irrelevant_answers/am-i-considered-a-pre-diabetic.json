            "answer": "If you are using home testing device, I guess you are using different fingers everytime you took a blood sample. I was told once that taking a blood sample from the tip of the finger is not so accureate. You may want to have a professionally-managed blood test.But if your fasting glucose is above 150, that is quite high.My suggestion is to take the same test with the same constant variables provided. On the first day notice your last meal time at night and take a test in the next morning. Test you FPG and note it.Second day, eat the same meal at the same time at night. Take another test the next morning at the same hour. Write down your FPG.Do this several time, to make sure if you have constantly high FPG or it is just an occasional spike. And if you're using that home device, use the same finger.",

            "answer": "First, 7 hours is not long enough for a fasting test as it usually is 8-10 hours. One hour can make a difference. Second, does your home meter require calibration to test strips? Do the test strips have an expiration date? Can you see a doctor and get tested properly? Ask for an A1c which will average your past 2-3 months glucose levels. The results are presented in percentile [%] which when converted to eAG [estimated Average Glucose] tells you what your daily glucose was. This will tell you your status - normal, prediabetes, or diabetic.Lastly, keep in mind the FDA only requires mfg of home glucose test meters to be within \u00b120% of accuracy.",

    "question": "I tested my blood glucose today after a 7 hour fast and my reading was 155, then not a minute later it was 161, about 3-4 minutes later i was curious and tested it again, it was 168. Could stress have made it go up that many points within five minutes? Also am I prediabetic and what do i do to bring my numbers back down to normal?",
