            "answer": "Hi there!Diabetes is a disease that is diagnosed on blood sugar levels and ones response to sugar intake. Probably since your levels were \u2018controlled\u2019 on a diabetic diet, your doctor couldn\u2019t believe you actually had diabetes. I do agree with you that it wasn\u2019t correct on the part of your new doctor to completely rule out diabetes especially when you had a history. I would also support your approach for a diet control, rather than resorting to medications; \u2018unless your levels are way higher that remain uncontrolled on a diabetic diet\u2019. With a strict diet, physical exercise is beneficial and highly advised to keep the sugar levels in check. If the sugar levels get back in control with these measures, you would not require seeing a doctor, other than getting HbA1c\u2019s and follow ups for retinopathy, nephropathy and neuropathy, done once in a while.Hope this helps.Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi there!For people who have glucose intolerance and a high blood pressure, diovan is a good medication since it decreases the risk of development of type 2 diabetes. However rarely diovan may cause muscle breakdown as a side effect which may cause achy legs. I would advise getting your symptoms evaluated by your doctor for the possibility and if diagnosed as the reason, it is advised to switch to other group of medications like ACE inhibitors for blood pressure control. You may like to discuss the possibility with your doctor.Hope this was useful.Take care!",

            "answer": "Once again thank you for your input. I think it's time I looked for another Doctor. as this one, who seemed to start off well is not doing what is best for me, but what is best for the Pharmacutical companies. each time I visit him he want's to give me drugs. not actually looking at the cause and effects of the problems and consequences of too many drugs.",

            "answer": "Skipping meals, especially dinner is not a good idea, since this would lead to paradoxically increased sugar levels due to the stress hormones getting activated. Try having an light dinner with more of proteins, fruits and vegetables and plenty of fluids. Also several small meals during the day work better than few large meals, if not on medications. I hope you are exercising regularly as well in moderate amounts. If your sugar levels continue to remain this high with the changes, one might have to resort to medications. You may like to consult your doctor for the same.Hope this helps.Regards",

    "question": "What do you think of this situation. I have been a T2 diabetic for 9 years. diagnosed in Colorado. Through diet and exercise I became totally controlled, BG before eating 74 to 90 and after eating , never above 180My Dr said\" If he didn't know I was a diabetic he would swear I wasn't\" I moved to a different state, New Dr. He told me ( after Blood work) That I wasn't a diabetic and never had been. I argued with him , told him what my Dr in Co. had said... He insisted I wasn't a diabetic.... I wen off my diabetic diet... ( 6 months ago) NOW he's telling me I AM a diabetic and My blood Glucose is all out of whack. I am so angry with him. While off the diabetic diet I didn't eat like crazy but didn't monitor my BG, the way I used to. So now it's out of control. He wanted to put me on medication, I said NO I will handle this my self. I am exercising, and on a strict diet. What Else can I do? Find a New Doctor, one who will listen to me. Your thoughts on this please anyone.",
