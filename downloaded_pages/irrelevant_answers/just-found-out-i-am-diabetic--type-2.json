            "answer": "First of all, it is not the end of the world (or chocolate cake) to find that you have been diagnosed with Diabetes. I know it feels like it when you first find out and it is very frustrating as you learn more about this whole new lifestyle you are going to have. The basics of Diabetes is the same for every other non-diabetic. Try to maintain a healthy weight, watch what you eat, drink plenty of water and have a regular exercise program. If you want to indulge with a piece of chocolate cake, eat a very small amount. Enough to satisfy that chocolate craving without overindulging. Learn about carb counting so that you understand exchanges. If you eat more carbs at one time, eat less the next so it balances out in the end. You do not have to deprive yourself, that just leads you to binge on it in response. Exercise more. Most importantly, do yourself a favor and speak with a dietician or diabetes consultant. They will help you work out a diet that can include your favorite foods and the occasional dessert. Take a class, read the health pages here...get yourself informed. The more you know, the less frustrated you will feel and the less deprived. You will find that the \"new\" lifestyle is not so restricting as you initially think.",
