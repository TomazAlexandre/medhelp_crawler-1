    "question": "Hey all.\u00a0\u00a0I need a little help and some suggestions on blood work to get my GP to run on me.\u00a0\u00a0I quick rundown of my history:Early april began having paresthesias in all extremities, followed by right sided weakness two weeks later.\u00a0\u00a0Cervical neck MRI was clear as was Brain MRI.\u00a0\u00a0No B-12 deficiency or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 6-4 male, 250 lbs, with very high triglycerides and elevated cholesterol with low HDL.\u00a0\u00a0Neuro noted some slight ankle clonus bilateral (2 beats).\u00a0\u00a0No perprihreal neuropathy as per NVC and EMG.As of today, my paresthesia have improved moderately, and the right sided weakness has significantly lessened.\u00a0\u00a0However, now I seem to have shaky movements everywhere in my body, almost like I have this slight clonus everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0At certain points during the day, my ankles and arms just feel exhausted.\u00a0\u00a0No significant cognitive, bowel, urinary, or vision symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I would consider myself chronically slightly dehydrated to some degree.\u00a0\u00a0All my electrolytes are bordering on the low side during my last physical.\u00a0\u00a0Also, blood platelets have steadily risen in the past five years and are up to 390 (high limit is 415) and MCGC is 36.0 (high limit is 36.0).\u00a0\u00a0Don't know the significance of that.My neuro doesn't seem too interested in seeing me in the next six months so I figured I would visit my GP and have him take some blood and do some tests.\u00a0\u00a0Besides the major ones like Lyme and Lupus, what else might I want to have him look for?Would a scan of the T-spine be worthwhile?\u00a0\u00a0Since my symptoms are in the arms and legs, I would figure lesions in the T-spine would eliminate symptoms in the arms.Please let me know, I would like to see if my GP can rule out all the rare things.",
