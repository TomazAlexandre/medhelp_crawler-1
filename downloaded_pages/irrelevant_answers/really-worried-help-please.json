            "answer": "They have resting times when you're this early. The are also trying to figure out a scedual. I always drank something cold and watched tv laying down and my little boy would just kick and move around. Their just like us, lol. They get tired of moving around all the time too. This early on, a doctor wouldn't be counting movements or anything so I wouldn't worry. Once you're OB has you count movements then I would worry if your little one's not moving. For now though, their still trying to figure out all the moving and time frames and such. Also as you move around, you rock your baby to sleep with the sounds of you. I went though a depressed stage too. I think it's normal. Just try to relax and drink something cold, and lay down for a bit.",
