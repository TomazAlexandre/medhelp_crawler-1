            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well it could be PMR, but other causes too need to be investigated and ruled out. Unexplained aches and pains with rashes coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD/menopause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 24yr old female. Recently I started experiencing severe pain throughout my entire body (joints and muscles affected). I couldn't sit, stand, lay down or anything to ease it. I went to the clinic, and the doctor asked about some of my past history, and suggested that it may be polymyalgia rheumitica (PMR), and prescribed prednisone as a diagnostic tool. I also noticed I was running a low grade fever and took some Tylenol. (I read PMR is sometimes accompanied by low grade fevers...not sure if that's a coincidence or not....but I figured it's not a bug as I believe prednisone is an immunosuppressant and would have made it worse if it was?)The prednisone within an hour began relieving the pain. I was able to get comfortable enough to sit or lay down for awhile. After a couple days of taking the prednisone I do feel better, still have some pain in my feet and hands but very tolerable. I did have episodes over the past few years of random pain throughout my body (sometimes everywhere, or isolated), but never as severe as this past episode.After reading up on PMR, some of the symptoms fit but not many, but it expresses how unlikely it is for someone under 50 to have this. The information out there on this, is VERY limited. I was wondering if anyone has any experience with PMR? or any other suggestions about what I'm experiencing? I have a follow-up scheduled soon with my family doctor.Thanks",
