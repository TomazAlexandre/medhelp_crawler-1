            "answer": "Hi.First of all, please do try to calm down for a moment. I understand that all these symptoms have been causing you some degree of anxiety but continuing to worry about them without knowing yet what the problem is might be more detrimental to your health.Almost all of the conditions you mentioned could possibly cause your symptoms. Anxiety and stress have been known to cause somatic symptoms which do mimic symptoms of organic disorders. A pinched nerve is also a possibility especially with symptoms of pain and tingling sensations in certain parts of your body. Other conditions that can cause similar presentations include vitamin and mineral deficiencies, diabetes, thyroid disorders, multiple sclerosis, etc.If your symptoms should persist or worsen, it might be best to consult a doctor to rule out these possibilities. Additionally, you might want to consider talking to a counselor to help you deal with your anxiety and panic attacks.Hope this helps.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Well, I'm going to go with the position that anxiety and panic attacks may be caused by a problem with brain chemistry.I know of two supplements that may help with this:\u00a0\u00a0magnesium and fish oil capsules.\u00a0\u00a0You can google for anxiety, magnesium, or anxiety, fish oil,\u00a0\u00a0to find related information to back this up.This will take some effort on your part, as you have to find good products and continue to take them a couple times daily.The fish oil should be pharmaceutical quality, so that it does not contain mercury.As for the magnesium, you should know that magnesium oxide is poorly absorbed in the intestines.\u00a0\u00a0But it is cheap, so that is the form used in many multivitamins and other products.I have been using Source Naturals Ultra-Mag, which contains mag glycinate and taurinate.Wishing you the best,Carol",

    "question": "About two weeks ago I started \"supposably\" having panic attacks. I went to the ER because I thought that I was dying and/or having a heart attack. The doctor told me my heart beat and blood tests and breathing were all normal. I even went to see a cardiologist and had a 24 hour heart monitor put on and that was normal as well. Sometimes I have this weird uncomfortable minimal pain and discomfort in my left side of chest in my abdomen, and my left shoulder and left arm and left side of my back right below my shoulder. I get this tingly feeling that goes through my left side. I also sometimes get very minimal slight pains in my left side of my neck and sometimes the right side. And my muscles in my legs seem a little sore not much but they get little pains here and there. Is this anything serious? I also sometimes feel dizzy, and always tired even after sleeping very well at night. Sometimes this weird feeling goes from my left top back to my head and it feels like Im going to fall asleep im not so sure whats going on. Is this all anxiety or am I really experiencing something? Could it be a pinched nerve or a pulled muscle? what should I do?",
