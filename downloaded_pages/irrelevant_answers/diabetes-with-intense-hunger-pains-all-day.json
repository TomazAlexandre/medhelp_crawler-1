            "answer": "Sounds very much like you are eating the wrong type of foods if you are constantly having hunger pains, and as you probably already know that eating the wrong type of foods can spike up your sugar levels.Keeping blood sugar levels at the optimum level is very important.\u00a0\u00a0Too high sugar levels can create a lot of other health problems.\u00a0\u00a0Sugar levels dropping too low can send you into a hypoglycaemic state.The types of food that you should be eating are those that are slow release, like porridge, brown rice, brown bread, chicken, fish, lean meat (not fried), vegetables and fruit, yogurt, eggs.\u00a0\u00a0Protein foods like meat, eggs, nuts and some pulses are slow release energy foods.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking water or herbal teas (without sugar and milk) will also help.A brown piece of toast with peanut butter (you can now buy Organic peanut butter that contains no added sugar) will keep you going for quite a while, as will porridge (I make mine with water and eat it with fresh raspberries or blackberries/blueberries).\u00a0\u00a0Some people like to make it with milk with a pinch of salt - no added sugar.Have smaller meals with a healthy snack in between so that your sugar levels never dip too low.\u00a0\u00a0Having fish or meat with lots of vegetables like cabbage, green beans, broccoli, cauliflower will also fill you up.\u00a0\u00a0Eggs are a good choice because these are protein foods that will give you satiety and will also release energy slowly.\u00a0\u00a0The protein foods and slow energy release foods will also make you feel no so hungry so quickly.It takes our brain 20 minutes to get the message that the stomach is satisfied and full.\u00a0\u00a0So after a meal have a drink of water and see how you feel before you have some more to eat.\u00a0\u00a0Before having a meal, drink a glass of water, this will fill your stomach making you feel not so hungry.Soups made with vegetables, pulses, and pieces of meat are also a good option.Ask our doctor to refer you to a diabetic dietician who will be able to help you make good food choices.Being a diabetic doesn't mean that you have to cut out completely all the foods you like, but the fast release foods like white bread, cakes, biscuits, chocolates, sweets and fruit juices should be eaten in very small quantities.The thing also is if you are physically active then you will be able to eat more because our body will be using up the energy from food.\u00a0\u00a0Look at food as fuel which converts into energy in our body).The best appetite suppressant for diabetics is plain water.\u00a0\u00a0But don't have more than 2-3 litres per day because having too much water is just as dangerous as being dehydrated (not having enough).You can also find some good recipe ideas on the web.Best wishes.",
