    "question": "I am Cheri Cockrell, Bill's wife. I am the one who is asking the question. My husband had triple bypass surgery 3 1/2 weeks ago. I have been taking care of his incisions on his chest, his 3 chest tube holes and the incision on his leg. That\u00a0\u00a0particular incision is the problem. It starts from the groin and ends about 3inches past the knee. About 5 inches from the groin he has a 1 inch spot that drains all of the time. If you wipe it off, then you will have to dab it again within a few moments. It is the size of a small pea that accumulates. It is so much that my husband will put a bandage on it and then get his pants on. Almost immediately it will soak through the bandage and need to be changed again. I also want to say that he has been a Type 1 diabetic for 43 yrs. He is 53 now. Other problems are this: On his right hand the thumb, index finger and middle finger are numb and he is not able to write with them at all. From the wrist up to the armpit is constantly in dull pain. Secondly, His chest area on both sides of the chest incision are numb also. We have been told that this may subside, but we also have been told that the doctor could have cut a nerve to the fingers. I don't seem to get any straight answers from any of the phsycians, so that is why I am asking this online. The only answer that his doctor has given is that he may have to go back in the leg area and find out why the fatty tissue is still holding the fluid. We are worried that there are some very serious problems going on here and they are being ignored by our doctors. We are very worried that after 31/2 weeks he is still oozing fluid from the leg. Also, because he is diabetic that when he is laying down with his leg above his heart, his foot goes numb. We have also been told that later on this year he will have to go back in and have surgery on his legs. I know this is a very long letter, but there are quite a few problems that we are very worried about. I thankyou so much for taking the time to answer these questions and we will be watching for your answer. God Bless You! Cheri Cockrell",
