    "question": "I was taken into hospital recently (unrelated minor issue) where it was discovered I had a slow resting heart rate of 45 bpm (I am not a trained athlete :D) my heart rate does come up to about 60 -70 when I move around or get stressed. An ECG was normal. It was suggested I see my GP re hypothyroidism.I have struggled with my weight for many years. I have to work very hard to lose any weight but it goes on very quickly. I am constantly tired and can sleep for 12 hours + at a time if I don't set my alarm clock. I have terrible pains in my feet and ankles, I feel cold, most of the time and I am very sensitive to pain. I ache all over and am day by day losing enthusiasm to do anything (this is NOT like me).For the last 3 years I have put these symptoms down to being overweight but in the last 8 months, through strict dieting (diet club) I have lost 2 stone but feel worse, not better.I saw my GP who tested for diabetes (negative) and for hypothroidism. He only ordered a TSH, I asked him to do a FT3 & 4 but he said it wasn't necessary, a TSH would be conclusive. It came back as 3.08 which he says is perfectly normal and I just need to lose more weight.My gut feeling is telling me there is something more but my GP won't do anything else, he says I'm ok. I have looked at some lists of Hypo symptoms and I have a fair few, can anyone please advise me, I feel rubbish.",
