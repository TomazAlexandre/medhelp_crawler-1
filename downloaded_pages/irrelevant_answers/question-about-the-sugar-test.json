            "answer": "Without warning? That's odd. They usually warn you at the appointment before and tell you the food restrictions so you can prepare for it.But when again i guess the test has improved since my last pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Because i had to fast for 8 hours before that test. This time they just said nothing sweet before.",

Then today I realized that morning/afternoon I had had a pop tart, gatorade, and a fruit roll-up. And even my mom said they were supposed to warn you beforehand about the restrictions. And today I got a call saying I needed to come back for the 3 hour test. And I'm dreading it!",

    "question": "Okay so yesterday I had a regular monthly check up. And after two ultrasounds confirming that I'm now due Nov. 20th, they STILL had the wrong information in the system. So they randomly decided that I should do my sugar test since I wasn't 29 weeks, only 26. Which was fine, but I had just had a pop-tart and a lot of gatorade right before my appointment. Could that affect my test results?",
