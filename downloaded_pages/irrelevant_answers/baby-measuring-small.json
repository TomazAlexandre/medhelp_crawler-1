            "answer": "Just means your baby is measuring smaller than average that's all... its not a big deal... they just have growth charts for gestational ages and yours happens to be on the lower side of things... it means you wont be giving birth to a big baby... mine is measuring in the 42nd percentile and I have gestational diabetes... so I am very glad that she is a little on the smaller side because I dont have to freak out about hwr being too big or needing a c section as of right now",
