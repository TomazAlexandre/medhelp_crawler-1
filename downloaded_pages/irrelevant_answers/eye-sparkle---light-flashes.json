            "answer": "nervous may have a different interpretation, but my light shows are very different from floaters.\u00a0\u00a0Floaters are just blobs, sparklers are like what you see at a rock concert, lots of flashes.\u00a0\u00a0They were common when I was younger, and the diagnosis was a migraine moment without the headache.",

My right eye is proof of that.\u00a0\u00a0I see black \"bugs\" floating across my visual field, and I see green splotches alot. The vision I lost in my right eye is from plaque in the artery.\u00a0\u00a0The other problems I have I would think are connected to the problems with my blood flow and blood pressure. But then I don't know.",

            "answer": "Floating debris in the eye is very different from bright lights experienced with migraine. One is a physical object floating around, interfering with the sight, whereas migraines are to do with electrical signals which are interfered with. We have all experienced how rods and cones in the retina can become sensitised. If you stare at a fairly bright light for a minute, then look around, the light follows you. It appears everywhere you look.",

I do get a few sparkles when I shave my armpits. LOL\u00a0\u00a0I turn my head to look at the area of interest, shave and then look up. That's when I see sparks for a few seconds. Maybe it's a circulatory thing, like pins and needles if you lay on your arm.",

    "question": "I am a 27 y/o male.\u00a0\u00a0Generally healthy.\u00a0\u00a0In 2006 I had surgery to replace my leaking bicupisd aortic valve after a bout of endocarditis.\u00a0\u00a0I now have a mechanical st. jude valve.\u00a0\u00a0I take warfarin and my INR is consistently within range (2.0-3.0).Occasionally, I will see a small sparkle/pinpoint of light appear in my vision in one eye or the other.\u00a0\u00a0It will crawl/meander across the field of vision in that eye kind of like a worm and then disappear.\u00a0\u00a0It only lasts for a few seconds (maybe 5, maximum).\u00a0\u00a0I have a history of opthalmic migraines, and this is different than my typical aura symptoms and only occurs in one eye or the other.\u00a0\u00a0I never noticed anything like this before the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think there is a connection?I have been asking eye doctors about this for about 4 years and just recently one finally told me to ask my cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to see my cardiologist for my regular check up next month and I plan to bring it up with him, but I have been really worried about this lately - do you think it is cause for concern?",
