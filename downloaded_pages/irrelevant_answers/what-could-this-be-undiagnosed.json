            "answer": "Hi and sorry you have this. It looks like it could be (possibly) infected, hand eczema. Did you have small blisters at first then peeling then they swelled? If so it may be dyshidrotic eczema that got infected. Hopefully, the antibiotics will get rid of the infection in about 4-7 days and then you should see a dermatologist if you can in the mean time. They can give you a moderate steroid like Triamcinolone that you use sparingly to get rid of the peeling etc. Then try to keep you hands dry and moisturized. It is caused by a lot of things from allergy, genetics, high immune system, to irritation by some chemicals. You need to see if the dermatologist agrees that is what it is and if so rule out one by one which things are causing the irritation. I have it too. I use Cetaphil Intensive Repair hand cream. I use gloves when doing the dishes and so forth.Hope this helps.mkh9",

    "question": "I have diabetes type 2 if that matters and I have an infection on my hands and fingers, it looks like herpetic withlow but the blood tests came back negative. So it isn't herpetic withlow but no doctor knows what it is and I am getting the run around from doctor to doctor with no results or help. They put me an heavy antibiotics and antiviral drugs and nothing helps.I have taken some pictures but I'm not sure how to upload them I'll check if that's possible via PC.",
