            "answer": "The rash side effect of Lamictal can be fatal so thank goodness you are okay. I had not heard of the diabetes with Zyprexa before, I would read the fine print on your med insert for sure. I wonder what Topomax would do for you or possibly Abilify which has fewer side effects, especially in the eating department. Ya know we are unfortunately part of the pharmaceutical rat race and often times doctors have more experience with one med or another due to what the drug reps are pushing. DEFINITELY talk with your doctor about the high blood sugar and your concern for diabetes and see what they think about Abilify which is approved to treat bipolar.",

            "answer": "First zyprexa doesnt cause diabetes . the weight gain does . and it is possible to control your weight while on zyprexa. I have been on it for 7 years and at first I did gain gain weight but I have since lost all that I have gained on the zyprexa eat small 6 meals a day and exercise even if its just a brisk 30 minute walk. It will also help with the depression. No caffiene and no sugar as these both aggravate depression in bi polars.Love Venora",

I gained some weight at first on the zyprexa but am gradually getting that back off. I was slender to start with. Thanks for your thoughts.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with bipolar disorder about 7 months ago. My depressive side is much more dominant than my manic side. They firsy put me on lamictal and I wound up in the hospital with serious rashes. Now, I am on zyprexa qhich makes me want to eat everything in sight. It seems to have me syabilized but now I have read about the countess thousands of people who have gotten diabetes from taking zyprexa. I have high blood sugar anyway, so I assume I am at high risk. What should I do? Switch meds? If so, yo what? Or, stay with zyprexa? Any advice would be appreciated.",
