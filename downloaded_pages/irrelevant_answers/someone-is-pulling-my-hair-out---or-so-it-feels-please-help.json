    "question": "Hi,I'm a 29 year old healthy male. I'm experiencing very sharp pain episodes in the back of my head, 3cm to the left of center just above the top of my ear line. The pain spells feels like someone is pulling my hair out and lasts for a few seconds, then disappear. The spot where the pain was experienced, about 2cm in diameter, feels a little sensitive most of the time between these pain episodes when I apply pressure to the spot with my thumb.\u00a0\u00a0Time between these episodes range between a few minutes up to a few hours. I've been experiencing this for the past few days.Any ideas what this could be.",
