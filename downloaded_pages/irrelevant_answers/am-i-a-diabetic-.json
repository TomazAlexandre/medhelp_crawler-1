            "answer": "I agree with comment above but not 100%.By all means, control what you eat, do regular exercise,\u00a0\u00a0but if that does not work then don't hesitate to ask your doctor about taking an appropriate medicine ( For example, metformin) . I have been on insulin for 23 years and lead a near normal life. With diabetes, checking your blood sugars on a regular basis is important. Since you are from India, I would also regularly get blood pressure and cholesterol levels checked because we Indian are prone to metabolic syndrome where blood sugar, lipids and blood pressure are all elevated and leads to a number of problems.Specific diet changes 1. when it comes to rotis, do not sieve the flour. If possible add extra bran. The chapati may not look appetizing but the fiber in the bran will slow done sugar absorption2. Avoid fried foods like bhajiya or samosas3. if possible , start carbohydrate counting. You may need to buy a basic scale in order to measure raw materials going into your curries and their carbohydrate count. The net has number of sites which can help in calculation.Best of health.",

            "answer": "Mr Anjan,your fasting sugar is moderately high which puts you in pre-diabetic or diabetic range. When you say post-lunch, how many hours had passed after lunch when the sugar was checked ? I ask because I would have expected that number to be as high or higher than the fasting number. However, if the post lunch test was done after many hours with perhaps you being moderately active, then that would explain the relatively low number.Regardless of the numbers, there is no harm in following a healthy diet LOW in refined carbohydrates (examples of refined carbs include white rice, potatoes without skins white wheat flour, sugar etc). Also as I said before, get hold of information on carbohydrate counting. Also have smaller frequent meals rather than following the two big meals\u00a0\u00a0tradition common in India,.Take care.",
