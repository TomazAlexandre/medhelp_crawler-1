Her coat is shinny and silky again and her appetite is back.\u00a0\u00a0She is still drinking prenty of water, but not nearly as much as before and her urine output is back to normal.Thank you for caring enough to reply to my comment,",

    "question": "My 11 yr old (female) long hair domestic cat Mia, was a healthy (chubby) cat just 6 mo ago.\u00a0\u00a0We started noticing that she was loosing weight, but she was eating just the same and the weight loss made her more active.\u00a0\u00a0But in the last month we noticed that she drastically lost weight (12 lbs to 4) and was drinking a lot more water than usual, from a cup a day to about 5 cups a day (maybe even more), and is urinating 4 to 5 times a day a large amount. She is an indoor cat (single cat in home), no flees, and no worm segments in stool, although 5 yrs ago she had to be dewormed. She was eating the same amount of food untill a week ago, now she scarcely eats, but seems to be hungry all the time. Anyone have any thoughts?\u00a0\u00a0I love my Mia, but cannot afford to take her to the vet much less pay for treatments/lab exams, etc.( I have a child with medical needs).~Joanna",
