            "answer": "Gestational Diabetes is a result of the pregnancy, usually they don't test for it until you are 28 weeks unless you are showing sugers in your urine. For some it starts as early as 8 weeks. You will probably be given the strict diet and within 2 weeks have to start insulin if you don't get it under control. It ***** having to give needles in you belly, but it hurts less then actuallly testing your sugar. It is very importnant to get it under control because there are lots of risks to the babyI had gestational diabetes, and because i was on bedrest and not getting any activity i was on insulin (walking/exercise also helps control it), at about 36 weeks my levels started droping and within a week i was off insulin, they then set up a induction because it meant my placenta was no longer working the way it should be.After i delivered all signs of the diabetes went away, but it does mean i am at greater risk to develop diabetes later in life, same with my child. Luckily since we controlled it so well he was a normal size which is one of the many complicatins that could ariseThey also said that I may or may not get gestational diabetes with my next pregnancy as every pregnancy is different...so to your orginal post i will say that it is \"normal\" that even though your sugars were fine before, and they're not now....its just due to the pregnancy itself",
