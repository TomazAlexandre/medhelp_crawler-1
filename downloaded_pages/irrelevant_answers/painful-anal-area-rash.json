            "answer": "Hi,A yeast or a fungal infection is likely the cause. This is mainly due to the long periods spent in wet bathing suit. Fungi thrives in wet or damp places. Diagnosis would be skin scrapings of the affected lesions and viewed under the microscope. Are there other signs or symptoms present? There are plenty of over the counter antifungal medications but it would be best to have it evaluated by your doctor to rule out other causes.Keep the area clean and dry. Avoid manipulating the lesion to prevent secondary infection.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "I have a terrible anal area rash that is spreading and very uncomfortable. It is swollen and red. I have recently moved to Hawaii and am spending a lot of time in a bathing suit. I first noticed the rash soon after I was sitting in the sand/coral beach and getting alot of it stuck in my anal area. I have had yeast infections in the past in the vaginal area but do not believe it to be this. Could the coral have caused it?It has been a week now and it is spreading and getting worse.Any suggestions?",
