            "answer": "I am 36 and pregnant with my 2nd as well. My daughter will be 17 when my little man gets here. Try not to stress any about it. I look at it this way, God wouldnt give me anything I can't handle and believe me its been tough. I've been in 2 car accidents in the last month one was really bad the other not as much. I'm graduating college in 4 weeks and I've been having contractions since the last accident. The stress from you worrying is bad for baby. My point is be happy about your upcoming bundle of joy",
