Did you eat or drink anything before your appt once you woke up? I've never had to go back and do the 3 hour test but I've heard of many ladies that failed the one hour and then passed the 3 hour.",

            "answer": "Usually for the one hour test they say to eat something small before hand. I don't know you're chances on passing the three hour test bc I've never had to take it but I'm guessing if you didn't pass the one hour test your chances of passing the three hour test isn't too high. Good luck though I hope you do pass nd everything is fine. Diabetes runs in my family too so I kno how worried you are",
