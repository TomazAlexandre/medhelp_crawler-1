            "answer": "Hi!It sounds to me like you have a very common sydrome known as syndrome X or metabolic syndrome or PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0This is a syndrome in which insulin resistance (which can and often does proceed to diabetes) is associated with failure to ovulate regularly which in turn make the periods irregular.This usually SHOULD be treated some how.\u00a0\u00a0The uterus usually needs to clean itself at least once every three months to stay healthy--otherwise the lining can build up and get so thick that it start bleeding continously for weeks on end--sometimes heavy sometimes light, sometimes clotty, sometimes spotty--sound familiar?The reason I say it should be treated is that I have actually seen a case of a 27-year-old who developed cancer of the uterine lining due to years of build up of tissue in the lining.Treatment could be birth control pills (cheap at Planned Parenthood) or the depot shot (also cheap at Planned Parenthood) or some people choose to take provera every three months to cause the lining to clean off.\u00a0\u00a0Other people take medicine to help them get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0We also usually recommend--You guessed it!--weight loss.You should also be tested for diabetis and watched for that.A trip to your doctor or neighborhood nurse practitioner now might save you a lot of money and head ache down the road!Good luck!Dr B .",

    "question": "I am a 28 year old woman with irregular ongoing menstruation for 2 months, sometimes heavier than others but usually very light with minimal clotting. I am over weight, and until about 4 months ago didn't have periods at all since the age of 17 when my mother made me get a depo shot.\u00a0\u00a0 I was diagnosed with amennoreah. had the hormone pills once. Never looked into the problem again, because I have no insurance.\u00a0\u00a0Had testing for fasting labs show recently a fatty liver, not sure if that...Also, Instead of tampons, or pads, I have used a Natural Sea Sponge, could this be causing this problem?",
