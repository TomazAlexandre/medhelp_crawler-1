            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well it can be diabetic neuropathy but it looks more like TIA which is also possible in diabetes. This looks more like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Otherwise it could be due to nerve compression very high up in the cervical vertebra. Please consult a neurologist. You may need to undergo MRI of the brain or cervical spine.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
