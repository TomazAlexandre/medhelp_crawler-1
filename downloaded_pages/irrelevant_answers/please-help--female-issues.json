            "answer": "Hi:-) There is a possibility that your Mirena has Shifted. Mirena may attach to or go through the wall of the uterus and cause other problems. Kudos to you for acting fast and making an appt. I would see if you can get a earlier appt just to be on the safe side. The good thing is you're not in pain! Good luck and I hope you keep us updated on how you make out:-)",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!In all probability you are having muscle twitches. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause. Discuss with your doctor. Take care!",
