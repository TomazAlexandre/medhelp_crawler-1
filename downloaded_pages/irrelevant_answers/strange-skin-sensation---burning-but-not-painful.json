            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Generalized feeling of a burning sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. This would need a comprehensive investigation. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm experiencing a strange sensation on my skin.\u00a0\u00a0The best way I can describe it is that it feels like I have Vicks Vapor Rub on the skin, only I don't - that strange cold/warm feeling, like a burn (sort of) but not painful.\u00a0\u00a0I felt it in my chest first and it felt similar to sipping liquor, like warm burning sensation but defintely not an acid reflux sensation.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like it's in the skin, not under it, if that makes sense.\u00a0\u00a0Now I notice it on my upper arms, boths sides.\u00a0\u00a0It's not painful at all, but noticeable.\u00a0\u00a0What could be causing this?",
