    "question": "Age 65\u00a0\u00a0 5\u20198\u201d\u00a0\u00a0112 LBCan these results be skewed because of 6 months at 8,000\u2019 elevation and lack of water??I just had my annual physical here in my home state where the elevation is 500 feet above sea level.All was well last year but today the fasting lab results showed elevated Hemoglobin Levels of 10. I now have diabetes consult scheduled and am monitoring my blood sugar levels (non-fasting blood sugar was 106 at the doctor\u2019s office and 96 before supper).I just spent 6 months living at 8,000 feet above sea level and fasted for 14 hours having drunk little water during this fast.Can these results be skewed because of 6 months at 8,000\u2019 elevation and lack of water??Thank you in advance.Kamper",
