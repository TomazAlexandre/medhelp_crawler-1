    "question": "So I'm at the Drs office right now. Had to drink that sugar water stuff. It actually wasn't bad. I was told to be seen again at 10:10 and 11:10 and not to leave. Why? Do they do blood work at those times or more sugar water?\u00a0\u00a0I've seen post of the mothers to be hating the taste but not this other stuff. My mom is mad I have to be here all day cause I have work after. Said she never had to do it.",
