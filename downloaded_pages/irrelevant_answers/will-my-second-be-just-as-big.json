    "question": "My daughter (first baby) was giant at birth 10lb 12oz and my dr had no clue.Based on my belly size and the amount of fluid I lost when my water broke they estimated 7lb max. Is there any way to know if I'm in for another large baby?My OB stopped delivering babies after my first so I'm having to switch and not sure if my new OB will think to check my babies size since my belly doesn't get extra large.I'm all for doing another one vaginally just kinda want to know if I can have a correct estimate baby size so I know what to expect when pushing.",
