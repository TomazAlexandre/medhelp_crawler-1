            "answer": "Overall, I agree with kitcurious;Any cola/soda (especially diet) tends to be sweet and make us (meaning we diabetics) 'remember' sugary foods and makes us want more sweet foods, which we know just isn't good for us.\u00a0\u00a0But... I really do believe in \"moderation in all things... including moderation\" and so, if you are craving a soda (or moreso, craving something sweet and a glass of zero-carb soda will truly fulfill that craving) then yeah, go for it...\u00a0\u00a0but just please remember portion control... at least be mindful of it...In my personal experience, diet colas make me want more sweet or high-carb foods, and from this forum I think that's a pretty normal experience, so it's best to avoid them if you can; but, if you can get yourself to see them as a 'treat' and push-off any other cravings, then sure, go for it.",

Researchers have reported a correlation between diet soda and metabolic syndrome, which the Mayo Clinic describes thusly:Metabolic syndrome is a cluster of conditions that occur together, increasing your risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes.Of course, the best solution is to forego soda altogether. Diet soda is associated with obesity and metabolic syndrome. Regular soda is dense with calories and sugar. Water has none of these drawbacks.",

            "answer": "The artificial sweeteners in diet soda, particularly aspartame, carcinogenic and damage DNA. They are neurotoxic and dangerous. There is a good argument for banning them from the market.The degree of neurotoxicity and hazard is an open question.One of the problems is that it is easy for have six or seven cans of diet soda during the course of a hot day. That substantially increases the hazard. It is inexcuseable to serve diet beverages of any kind to children.It is far better to change to simple water and lemon juice for a thirst quencher.",
