            "answer": "I doubt that you are pregnant if you had sex on April 24th and then were supposed to have your period on May 1st but there is always a chance that you could have ovulate later than normal. I would definitely say take another test in a few days and see how it comes out. I don't have diabetes but there is always something the doctors can do to help you out when you are pregnant to control it. Good luck!",
