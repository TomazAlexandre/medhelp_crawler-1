            "answer": "HI there. You have a polyneuropathy which could be due to vitamin B12 deficiency,B6 deficiency, alcoholism, diabetes, uremia etc. You need to stop alcohol intake, supplement vitamins, investigate with blood tests if you have diabetes and renal function. MRI spine should also be done to look for any disc herniation causing the tingling, numbness. A detailed neurological examination for sensory, motor systems and autonomic system, the reflexes should all be checked for any associated deficits.\u00a0\u00a0I am glad that you are seeing a neurologist soon for this. Take care.",

    "question": "For about 15 days i've been experiencing numbness all over my body, plus some pins and needles. Everything my body touches it just doesn't feel the same its less sensitive. I first notice these symptoms 15 days ago after a night of heavy drinking. I've been drinking\u00a0\u00a0on the heavy side for about 2 years. So does this sound like polyneurpathy? And is it reversible with alchol abstinece and vitamins?",
