    "question": "Before I ever took an ultrasound, calculations for my due date were based off of a known conception date and known last menstrual date which put my original guessed due date at December 27/28, 2014. I know it's rare to know conception date but I do exactly. However, AFTER my first 12 week ultrasound they moved my due date back to January 10, 2015. Around 25 weeks, they moved my due date up a day to January 9, 2015. Well today at my 34 week scan, I noticed the gestational age for my baby was dated 36 weeks and she weighs in the top 10% at 5 lbs 9 ounces for a 34 week baby. The average baby at 34 weeks is between 4-5. They did not mention changing my due date though. It just seems bizarre that she is actually measuring to what my original due date was (2 weeks prior) and it hasn't been changed. Has anyone dealt with this? Or do you think I will go into labor early?",
