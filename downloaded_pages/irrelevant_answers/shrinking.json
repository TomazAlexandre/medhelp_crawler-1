            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You could be having muscle and soft tissue wasting. You need to get investigated to rule out hyperthyroidism, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, collagen diseases, and worms in stool.Also since you are gaining weight, you need to find out if you have anemia, diabetes, adrenal gland problems, and hormonal disturbances as in PCOD.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis. Take care!",

I don't take any other medicines,I have been obese for about 25 yrs which occured after I quit smoking and have gained about 5 lbs a yr, that's what I meant by I am gaining weight. My weight has stabled itself in the last few years, that's why I am concerned about the shrinking of my fingers, wrists and ankles. I guess I need to find a specialist. Thanks for your suggestions.",

    "question": "I have noticed that my fingers, wrists, and ankles are getting smaller. My fingers have gone down 2 sizes. I had to have links taken out of my bracelet, and my anklet got so loose until it fell of my foot. I have asked my doctor, but he doesn't have a clue. I have no pain in my joints, and I have gained weight in my body since this started.",
