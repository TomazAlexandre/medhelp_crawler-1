            "answer": "Just saw your message -- sorry for the delay in responding.If you search online for the word\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0-- eurolyme --\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 you will find some very helpful links.You can also try other possible search words or phrases such as-- european lyme disease --but the results from the 'eurolyme' search are enough.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors in Europe seem to have the trouble that American doctors have:\u00a0\u00a0ignorance of how widespread Lyme is, and that other infections often come along with other, separate infections.You say:\u00a0\u00a0\"Hello, unfortunatly im not feelin good for so long now, main symptoms are low grade fever and tirdness, muscle pain.\"\u00a0\u00a0That is how I felt also, before I was diagnosed with Lyme and babesiosis (one of the co-infections often carried by the Lyme ticks).\"I live in the Europe in a contrey when Lyme is very very rare,\"\u00a0\u00a0-- that is also what many doctors say about Lyme in the US.\u00a0\u00a0There is much ignorance among the medical establishment about how widespread and miserable Lyme is.\"should i ask my doctor to test me for Lyme, (Mycoplasma)\u00a0\u00a0because this is my last option.\"\u00a0\u00a0Mycoplasma and Lyme are not the same infection or disease, to my understanding.About Lyme, there are different tests, some of which are not very reliable.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, those less reliable tests are those used by many doctors.It sounds like your doctor has tested for many things, which is good to confirm that you do not have any of them.\u00a0\u00a0The remaining question, of course, is what do you have?\u00a0\u00a0When I was sick, my doctors (20 of them!) tested me for many things, and finally #20 tested me for Lyme disease.\u00a0\u00a0The test was positive for Lyme, but the doctor said I could not have Lyme because I \"did not look sick enough.\"\u00a0\u00a0End of conversation.You are not alone in dealing with doctors who do not understand Lyme.\u00a0\u00a0It is good that you have been tested to rule out other illnesses (\"Hiv, Diabetes, Thyroids, Complet CBC, Stool parasites Etc.\"), but your doctors do not seem to truly understand Lyme and how to diagnose and treat it.I just did a search online for-- eurolyme --and there were many interesting links.I encourage you to find an MD/physician who understands Lyme disease and other infections the 'Lyme' ticks often carry.\u00a0\u00a0ALL MDs believe they truly understand Lyme, but because of the confusion in the medical world, many MDs do NOT really understand.Someday the medical world will have all of this fixed, but for now, we Lyme patients much be aware that many MDs are simply wrong and ill-informed.\u00a0\u00a0Please find an MD who truly understands Lyme before agreeing that you do not have it!Try a 'eurolyme' search and see if you can find an MD near you.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know how you do, okay?\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes to you -- please let us know how you do.",
