            "answer": "No, when my levels are low there is no reaction.\u00a0\u00a0I used to get very, very sleepy when the levels were very high but even that does not happen anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I got a response from my doc and he simply lowered one of my meds.\u00a0\u00a0He also said that if the levels continue to go down he would eliminate one of them.\u00a0\u00a0I was surprised because he lowered the Glipizide and not the Glucophage!!Also, I really do not think they will be putting me on insulin, I will do whatever they indicate though, but I just do not think I need it.Anita",

    "question": "I have been taking pills for my Diabetes for years now.\u00a0\u00a0This past March I suppose I lost my mind one day and forgot I was Diabetic & ate Girls Scout Cookies for one meal and Chinese Food for dinner.\u00a0\u00a0When I took my blood level that night the first reading was 474.\u00a0\u00a0I then took all my meds waited the appropriate time and tested again.\u00a0\u00a0The meter simply said \"HI\".\u00a0\u00a0I then tested again about 10 min. later & the level was 574.\u00a0\u00a0The advice nurse at my health plan told me to get to the hospital pronto.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I had no ride. (I am not allowed to drive because of my Epilepsy)\u00a0\u00a0I waited until 4:15 am and tested again, the meter again said \"HI\".\u00a0\u00a0I felt I could not wait any longer and my neighbor gave me a ride.\u00a0\u00a0Emergency gave me 2 shots of Insulin and when I saw the Endo doctor a week later he put me on Byetta.Okay, my question is - Are there other folks on Byetta out there who are now losing their appetite??\u00a0\u00a0I find now that I must force myself to eat.\u00a0\u00a0On Friday night my blood level was 78 before I ate and 73 after (what does that mean??).\u00a0\u00a0I do not mind that the lack of eating is making me lose weight (Thank God) but I am concerned about the blood levels.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have another appointment with the Endo man until June but we do communicate by computer.So - anyone on Byetta let me know please.\u00a0\u00a0Also, is Byetta just a precursor to Insulin - the way my levels are going I really do not think I will be needing that.",
