            "answer": "It is gestational diabetes and the test is very simple. You can not eat from midnight the day before and then when you get there, they will give you a small glass of a drink similar to gatorade, you have to drink it in 5 minutes and then wait for an hour to get your blood drawn. This one is simple!",

            "answer": "Since your is at 3pm, you need to ask your Dr. when you need to stop eating. Most women do it the first thing in the morning to get it over with. If you do end up eating, your glucose will show up high just like my did (over 140) and you will have to do the 3 hour test. Imagine that. You do not eat for 3 hours and they will poke you 3 times. Call your Dr. about the time you need to stop eating. Pretty much that is it. You will have one more US sometimes in the 3rd trimester and as long as everything looks fine then you should have no more tests. You will start going to your Dr. every 2 weeks in your 3rd trim. around 34 weeks I believe.",

            "answer": "I was allowed to eat. I didn't have to fast for this one (I did mine today) but if I don't pass this one and need to do the 3 hour I have to fast. The drink DOES taste horrible. It's like REALLY REALLY sweet orange pop. See if they can have it cold for you, it isn't as bad cold. It's a styrofoam cup full. The waiting afterwards is a pain in the butt. You are not allowed to eat or drink anything during that hour. Some women I know had their drs tell them that if you can, don't eat anything for 3 hours before. Something about eating and throwing your numbers off.I would ask your dr about whether you need to fast or not because as far as I know you don't have to for the 1 hour glucose but you do for the 3 hour test.Good Luck",

            "answer": "I had my test at 28 weeks...all you have to do is drink this sugary liquid and keep it down and wait an hour to do blood work...and my dr didnt say anything about eating before the test...and mine was at 8am...I had a full breakfast that morning and also ate supper the night before with desert. And I passed it...I think if you fail the test then you have to go for the 3 hour glucose test and you cant eat after midnight the day before.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your Dr though...they will let you know.This was the second time I had the glucose test done...they did one at 7 weeks so they could compare it later on at 28 weeks and they were the same.After my 28 week appt I started going every 2 weeks and now at 36 weeks I start going every week.\u00a0\u00a0The same time I had this glucose test I also had my iron levels checked and all they did was ***** my finger.\u00a0\u00a0At my 36 week appt they did a vaginal and a group B....not too bad...not like I was expecting.\u00a0\u00a0But he hasnt dropped yet so theres not alot of pressure down there yet.I saw your having a boy too...congrats...any names picked out yet? The count down is on for me...28 more days to go!!!Dont complain about being bored.\u00a0\u00a0Wait till he stays up all night and you cant sleep then you would wish everything was boring again!",

Before i was pregnant i couldn't understand how anyone could get bored with it. but oh do i understand now. I am just ready for the next 18 weeks to pass so i can see and hold my baby boy! Any one have any ideas on getting your mind off of the fact that you are pregnant??? All the fun stuff is over until you go into labor.Some one said something about having another ultrasound in the 3rd trimester. Is that true? I thought that they only give you one at about 20 weeks??? when does the 3rd trimester start anyway?",

For some reason my dr doesn't do his till 25 rather than 20 wks. anyway, as for the glucose test. I have always had mine in the morning, no food after midnight. The drink is very sweet and it is better cold. It is like a very very sweet orange pop. Last pregnancy I failed the first test and had to do the 3 hr test which is the same only they draw your blood every hr for 3 hours after the drink. My 2nd test was fine although he did say I failed the first hr but passed the last 2. I'm due for mine at 26 weeks and I'm nervous about failing it this time...I would hate to go through the GD thing. Anyway, good luck, it will be over quickly.",

My test results came back ok too, no where near being GD so I don't think the food effects the 1 hour test too much at all, unless your already borderline. But call ahead to make sure. I know I couldn't have food after I drank the \"drink\" for that one hour. Its actually a very simple test, don't sweat it. It didn't taste wonderful but it was better than I imagined it would be too. Good luck.",
