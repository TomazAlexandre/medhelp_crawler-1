            "answer": "ALS can be difficult to diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0An MRI as well as EMG studies would be recommended if this disease is suspected.Metabolic causes can also lead to some of the symptoms you describe.\u00a0\u00a0Testing for thyroid, vitamin B12 as well as diabetes should be considered.Muscle disorders can be evaluated with a creatinine kinase and aldolase level.At this time, I suggest a neurology referral.\u00a0\u00a0If non-revealing, you can consider an orthopedic referral and/or physical therapy to evaluate and treat the muscle symptoms.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "Hi,I have suffered from extensive worry over my health from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0I notice certain things and immediately think they are a serious symptom of a serious disease.\u00a0\u00a0I usually go to the doctor once , they tell me I am fine and I gradually stop thinking about it all the time and the symptoms go away.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The\u00a0\u00a0I had to drive all day one day.\u00a0\u00a0When I returned I noticed a sharp pain off and on in my left thigh.\u00a0\u00a0I immediately thought it was sciatica pain from driving all day.\u00a0\u00a0I began to really focus on it all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I then beagan to notice an aching pain in my hamstring area.\u00a0\u00a0This progressed to a general \"nervous or weak feeling\" in my leg.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have any physical weakness as.I began to worry about ALS.\u00a0\u00a0I think about it all day all the time.\u00a0\u00a0The weak \"feeling\" has not gone away and now I have some muscle twitching in my toes and calf/shin as well as slight ache in hamstring area.\u00a0\u00a0I have been online looking up symptoms and info on ALS for days (which i know doesnt help) .\u00a0\u00a0My question is can all this anxiety make me feel symptoms of \"weakness or nervous feeling in leg\" and twitching\u00a0\u00a0even though everything is normal? This is not the first time I have worried about ALS.\u00a0\u00a0I had twitching years ago and worried the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0It didnt go away until I stopped thinking about it. I am almost 33 year old in great health.\u00a0\u00a0I lift weights 5 times a week.Sorry for the long post.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your help in advance.",
