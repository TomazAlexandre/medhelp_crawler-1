            "answer": "it sounds like you're dealing with a lot!\u00a0\u00a0i would definitely talk to your child's endocrin doctor about the symptoms first, then try your regular peds doc if they think it's not related.\u00a0\u00a0my daughter was diagnosed at age 2, 4 years ago, and i can't say that i've heard of that kind of intestinal issue in relation to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0high blood sugar will cause stomach problems but they should be situational and short-lived.\u00a0\u00a0what you're describing sounds very gastro to me.since the onset is so new, maybe there are yeast issues from blood sugars staying high before diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0excess yeast can be the culprit of many gi symptoms, but is not a widely accepted problem in the medical field, outside of an obvious external infection.\u00a0\u00a0you may have to research that online and go with your gut.\u00a0\u00a0does she have anything else to make you think it could be that?\u00a0\u00a0rashes in warm areas, oddly bad breath?\u00a0\u00a0they, along with gi issues,\u00a0\u00a0are hallmark symptoms of internal yeast overgrowth.\u00a0\u00a0just a thought.best of luck -- it gets easier!!\u00a0\u00a0:)",

            "answer": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0I am a parent of a juvenile diabetic and he too had stomach problems just after being diagnosed with this disease.\u00a0\u00a0I continued to ask his gastro dr. and finally he was diagnosed with CELIAC disease.\u00a0\u00a0It is a gluten allergy that effects the small intestines so that nutrients cannot be absorbed into the body.\u00a0\u00a0There are many gluten free products available to you today. It is important to see if this is what your daughter has because untreated can create other illnesses in the future.\u00a0\u00a0Follow up with your dr and have the blood test done.\u00a0\u00a0It will either confirm or exclude this disease for your daughter.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you well and there are great foods out there to keep her satisfied.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck.",

    "question": "My daughter was recently diagnosed with juvenile diabetes in early february. she had been experiencing\u00a0\u00a0constipation for a short while before being diagnosed, then it subsided and she had no problem going to the bathroom. however, since she's been home from the hospital since the 12th of february, she's had constipation, emptying herself about once to twice a week (but not very much), strange twitching in her stomach, loud gurgling noises, bloating and very small amounts of pain about once a week. I don't know what's causing this and would like to find out. i couldn't schedule a visit to the doctor until the ending of may and i'm worried something might happen before then.thank you, concerned mother",
