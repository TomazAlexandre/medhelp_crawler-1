    "question": "Hi everyone - I'm hoping someone can help me here.In the last year I have gotten a lot of colds - on average almost one a month (although most were at the front end of the year). Other than one of these, the symptoms have been fairly mild, last a few days and then disappear. It usually only involves the nose, but I feel very run down at the same time. I'm more than certain these are actual colds, not allergies.I have also have had a white coated tongue for just over a year (as far as I've noticed) - but a swab came back negative for thrush.My GP ran a CBC, plus liver checks, diabetes test and cholesterol. All results came back within normal ranges.I have two main concerns - should I push for tests on my immune system (igg levels etc)?I have had a full STD panel that came back negative, but am concerned that the HIV test may not be accurate if my immune system is impaired.In addition, I also have skin problems - ezcema has gotten worse this last year and I have had weird marks (a red patch on the sole of each foot) lasting a few months.Anyone have any advice? I'm a 26 year old male, and although previously prone to the odd cold, have never had a year like this. I have never had a sinus infection or any other complications.Many thanks.",
