            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Skin conditions like psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin. One strong possibility is PCOS and thyroid disease for your wife\u2019s symptoms.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly, Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope it helps. Take care and lease do keep me posted in case you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hello,These type of sounds can be due to sinus congestion. Adenoid enlargement or some respiratory disease. My advice would eb to consult an endocrinologist and a dermatologist for all these symptoms. From the symptoms it looks like an endocrine disease for which investigations like various hormone levels like thyroid hormones, FSH, LH etc will be required.I hope it helps. Take care and warm regards.",
