    "question": "I am 25 and have polycystic ovarian syndrome. I have only gotten about 3 periods in my life on my own, any other time I've gotten it was from birth control that was prescribed to me to make me get my period. I have never consistently taken the birth control. I've always taken it for a few months, then stopped. I started YAZ about 6 months ago and only lasted about 2 months on it before quitting (my face broke out, i hated the way it made me feel,etc). At my most recent Gynecology visit about 3 months ago, I told my gynecologist that I had quit taking the YAZ. She was upset and said expressed how important it is for me to have a period each month. She prescribed to another birth control to try out to see if I respond to better. She told me to at least stick with it for 3 months and if I do decide to stop taking it, to call her and let her know so we can figure out another option. It has been 3 months now and I have never even turned in my prescription or started taking the new birth control. For the last month, I have had vaginal blood spotting. It never gets on my underwear. I only see it on the toilet paper when I wipe myself. The first two weeks were very red blood, it stopped for a few days, then I would see brown blood on the toilet paper for a few days after that. It stopped again for a few days, and now I am seeing red blood again when I wipe myself. I have no pain. What could this be and should I be concerned?! (I am nervous to go to my gynecologist because will be very upset that I did not follow through with the second birth control she prescribed to me when she specifically told me how important it was to try it for at least 3 months. I am worried about being dropped as a patient)Please help!",
