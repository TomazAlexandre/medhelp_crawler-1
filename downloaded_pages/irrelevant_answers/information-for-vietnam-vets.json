            "answer": "Right on! Thanks for sharing this! It's true, any Vietnam Veteran with Type II diabetes is immediately eligible for service connected compensation!Here's the key ~ the burden of proof of active duty service is No Longer On The Veteran.But those VSO's that are state/fed (paid or sponsored by a VSO or agency) may be limited to what they can share with the Veteran... The Veteran Has To Ask specific questions, and offer specific information.If you never 'set foot' in Vietnam, you may still be eligible for AO exposure compensation.If you were loading and unloading, on Any of the docks, or were around any places where these stupid chemicals were stored, or transported, etc.All you have to do is let the VSO/claims person know that- \"you touched a leaf on a tree\" at any of the coastal regions- 'you put one foot on the dockAlso, don't ever let someone tell you that you cannot complete your claim for compensation because the Ntl. Personnel Records Center burned down in the 70's!!!That is also outdated!!! Please don't let anyone tell you that malarkey again!The laws have changed in the past several years ~ the Burden of Proof of Service is no longer on the Veteran! It's where it belongs ~ on the gov't.If you've applied for benefits, and served in Vietnam, and your claim is not progressing ~ say in the past 30 years!!! ~ you have the wrong Service Officer!Our claims on behalf of our Vietnam Veterans are being processed faster, and more efficiently ~ partly due to the fact that you're our fastes growning population of aging Veterans.I'm So Sorry that you've all been ignored all these years! If you're still enfuriated by this whole thing, try to find someone that can advodate for you! So you don't have to be around people that have previously not given a rip!!! Protect yourself from bringing up all the horrible history of how you've been treated for Decades ~ and let someone assist you!Thank You So Much For Your Service & Sacrifice ~ Peace & Respect ~ Woshi.",
