            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes currently. This is my second pregnancy and ive had it with both pregnancies. You really dont feel much except if your blood sugar is really low or really high you can get hot, sweaty, nauseated, shaky and light headed. Sometimes you may not always feel the symptoms but it is good to snacks around just in case you start to feel a little uneasy. Gestational diabetes can be quite overwhelming at the beginning but it gets easier.",

    "question": "Can you describe the symptoms you feel from gestational diabetes? The best way you can? I have my 3 hour test tomorrow. Since about 24weeks ive not felt 100% and the doc i had did not test me for GD even though im high risk and both my father and grandfather are diabetic. She just kept saying next time but woukd see me every 2 weeks and just push me out and listen to heart beat with doopler. I got rid of her and got a new doc at 28weeks and did my 1hr GD test at now 31 weeks and failed. Im so mad that the first doctor just brushed me off like that and put me even more at risk. The new doc says she should of transferred me to someone else because she cant even do VBAC delivery. She also Had wrong info on my medixal records. I went back to make her correct it and she is no longer with that office no more! What are the symptoms you have from GD?",
