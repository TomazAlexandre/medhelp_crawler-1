            "answer": "I wanted to let you know that I have exactly the same thing as you describe. I am starting to get worried. My head sweats so much with no relief. My hair is literally dripping. The sweat doesnt smell, its just sweat. I cant even have the heat on in the house when the kids are cold. I have a fan blowing on me continously when I do my make-up. I have a fan at my desk. Cool air blowing on my face and head seems to be the only thing that stops it. Have you found out anything to help with this? Please let me know. I am suffering more and more every year....Kari",
