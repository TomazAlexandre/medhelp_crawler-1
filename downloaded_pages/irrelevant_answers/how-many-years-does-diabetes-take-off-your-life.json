            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.There is no formula that says that you have diabetes, subtract x number of years from your lifespan. Diabetes is a controllable disease. By maintaining a stable blood sugar, you have the power to prevent many of the symptoms/side effects of diabetes. The lifestyle you lead is a bigger factor in overall lifespan. A healthy diet, regular exercise, and healthy lifestyle decisions can do more to extend your life than a diabetes diagnosis may do to shorten it.Cathy",
