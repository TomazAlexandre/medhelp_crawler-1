My sister had me worried that something could be wrong, but I never felt that way, I figured it was just from a horrible third pregnancy Lol I'll run it by my Dr when I next him in 2 weeks but until then I'll try to keep this belly full. Although diabetes runs in my family (we always fail the first glucose test) no one yet has had gestational diabetes, thank goodness. My grandfather is the only one who has it as of right now and it is controlled and getting better with his lifestyle!",
