            "answer": "My doctor didnt ask me if i wanted to, i dont think thats something doctors typically give you a choice on unless theres some kind of reason behind it. They want babies to stay in as long as possible. My doctor told me she is inducing me a week earlier than my due date because i have gestational diabetes unless he comes early.",

            "answer": "I work in health care. It is believed that 41 weeks should be max. You do have the right to wait as long as baby is safe. If you wait past that time they will have you do non stress tests often to check on babies health and safety.\u00a0\u00a0It has a bigger risk as your placenta matures. I agreed to being induced with my 3rd but went 9 days over with baby number 1. Both were healthy. My health care providers and I talked about my comfort levels and I was informed before talking to them. They expressed what they think and presented a case too. In the end, we both agreed. I am on baby #4, and my dr and I will decide together what is best for me and baby.",
