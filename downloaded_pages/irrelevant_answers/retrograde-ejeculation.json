            "answer": "Dear Moin77,Retrograde ejaculation is a condition that typically occurs along with conditions such as diabetes or multiple sclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0This can also occur after surgeries such as transurethral resection of the prostate or retroperitoneal lymph node dissections for testicular cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Success rates as high as 40% have been achieved in clinical studies using either alpha agonist agents such as Sudafed or Phenylpropanolamine or the antidepressant Imipramine to treat retrograde ejaculation associated with diabetes or following retroperitoneal lymph node dissection.In your specific case, you may benefit from a different agent such as Imipramine.\u00a0\u00a0However, if your retrograde ejaculation was truly caused by trauma from a catheter, you may have a physical blockage of the semen flow from the vas deferens as it exits into the urethra via the ejaculatory ducts.\u00a0\u00a0If a blockage exists, this would most likely appear on an ultrasound exam as a grossly enlarged vas deferens.\u00a0\u00a0This could possibly be relieved by a transurethral resection of the ejaculatory ducts.\u00a0\u00a0Remember that I have not completed a thorough history and physical exam on you, and there is no substitute for a complete exam by a skilled urologist.This information is provided for general medical educational purposes only.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult your physician for diagnostic and treatment options pertaining to your specific medical condition.\u00a0\u00a0More individualized care is available at the Henry Ford Hospital and its satellites (1 800 653-6568).Sincerely,HFHS M.D.-BL",
