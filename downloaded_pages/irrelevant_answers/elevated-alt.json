            "answer": "An MRI, or CT scan\u00a0\u00a0would give the Dr. a fairly good idea of the liver.The one that they say is best is the biopsy. I've had all three.\u00a0\u00a0I know it sounds scarry, I've had 2 biopsys\u00a0\u00a0in one month (they missed the liver on the first one) the second one was done with a guided ultra sound. Even though I had that experience I'm glad to know . The procedure is very quick , one day out patient. Recovery is minimal ,discomfort for the first two days. Then the waiting begins for results. Unvortunatelly they found out to late for me I have Cryptogenic liver disease. Which went unnoticed for many years. So don't wait to long, Good Luck",

            "answer": "My a1c was 6.4 and my doctor says that is too high.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think 6.7 means that your diabetes is in control.\u00a0\u00a0I am a retired RN, diabetes was not my specialty, but after reading much about it, I have to agree with my Dr.If you are checking your blood glucose levels, and you're getting anything higher than 150 after eating, that is too high.",

    "question": "A year ago, my doctor gave me Lescol/Fluvastatin to take because I am a high risk for heart disease due to genetics and diabetes. At that time my Lipids were within normal range. After a month, ALT/AST results were very elevated.and medication was discontinued. Since then, I've gone through ultrasound, HiDa Scan and finally diagnose of fatty liver. The Gastroenterologist recommended Liver Biopsy to check for liver damage. This is a scary procedure and I wanted to know if there are other alternative procedure/processes. Also, is there something I can do or treaments I can receive to treat this problem. I weight 122 lbs, and 5'4 tall. I take Glucophage XR, Januvia, Glipizide ER, Avapro (to prevent kidney damage, not hypertensive), Calcium with Vit D, Fish oil, Loratidine (hives as needed) and Zantac.I walk, exercise and watch what I eat. My diabetes is under control with an A1c of 6.7. I would appreciate any suggestions or advise you can give me. Thank you.",
