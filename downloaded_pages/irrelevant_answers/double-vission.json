            "answer": "My uncle has diabetes really bad. I think that is type II? The only time I have had my blood sugar levels tested is when I was pregnant. With my last baby (he is 20 month now) the test showed it was a little high. My Dr. said I was border line. and he just watched me more closly. Do I have a higher chance of diabetes because of my uncle and that test coming out a little high? Or is it with pregnancy a completly a different issue, because I'm not pregnant right now.Is this something that should be checked now, or can I wait till next week?Thanks for the link, I will check it out.",

    "question": "I posted yesterday about not feeling well. I feel sick to my stomach all the time, especialy when I haven't eaten anything. I'm peeing all the time, even when I haven't had a lot to drink. I'm going about every 30 min. I have headaches, and no energy.And this moring I woke up and I'm seeing double. I have to strain my eyes to see normal. It's not completly double, it's like half, like everything has a shadow. It's really starting to give me a headache. Does anybody know what this could be? Is it serious? Can this be just nothing? I'm starting to get really nervous. My body just doesn't feel right. I'm going in on Tuesday to get some blood drawn, but I was hoping that some of you could give me some ideas as to what this could be.",
