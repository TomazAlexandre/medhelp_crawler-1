            "answer": "A dietician or nutritionist should be able to help you; or you can check your local yellow pages for weight loss specialists, but be careful - you don't want to get someone using such things as hcg, etc because those don't work.",

            "answer": "Yes, I'm sure a bariatric doctor would be able to help you, but might be more likely to push for surgery, since that's their specialty.Actually, a good primary care physician could most likely help you, as well. Plus there are a lot of different weight loss clinics around, most run by doctors, though I don't know if your insurance covers that type of doctor.HCG is a hormone produced by pregnant women that many weight loss doctors are providing to their patients, mostly in shot form, for weight loss. The HCG program includes a diet that consists of only 500 calories/day, so it's not really the HCG that causes the weight loss, it's the drastic cut in calories, which is very bad for you.What have you tried so far, to lose weight?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe if you stick around, we can help you.Have you had your thyroid tested to make sure you aren't hypothyroid, which causes weight gain/inability to lose.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, insulin resistance and PCOS, both make it very difficult to lose weight.",

Insuracne covers doctors, but I doubt it will cover weight loss clinics. Certoanly wont conver nutritionist/dietician.",

I will defintiely keep in touch with you about the weight issue ..I have no history whatsoever of ovarian diseases. It was never an issue.My weight gain is due to my anxiety leading to emotional eating, and binging in the evenings and nights. I went to see my family Doc the other day, he put me back on Wellbutrin XL .. and I beleive that particular depressant in the past has helped me lose weight and feel better by lowering my anxiety level .",
