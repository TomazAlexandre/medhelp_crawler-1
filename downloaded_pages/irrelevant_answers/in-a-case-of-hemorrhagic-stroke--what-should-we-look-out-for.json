To prevent any recurrence of stroke, it is important to identify her stroke risk factors, regular follow-up with her attending physician and adopting a healthy lifestyle which includes controlling high blood pressure, controlling diabetes, maintaining a healthy weight, healthy diet, exercising regularly, and intake of preventive medications prescribed.

    "question": "Hello Doctor,My 45 year old mother had a hemorrhagic stroke 21 months ago. The whole of her left hand side was paralyzed and apparently the stroke was caused as an artery burst in the center of her brain. She had a very speedy recovery from her stroke and her tests are also coming normal. My question is that to avoid another stroke, what precautions should we take and what should we look out for?Thanks.",
