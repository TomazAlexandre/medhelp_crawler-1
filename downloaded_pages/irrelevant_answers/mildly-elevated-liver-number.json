            "answer": "dear lynnc,i would recommend that you take milk thistle to help control the liver enzymes.also cut back on meat and salt both of which can raise blood pressure and are hard on the liver.eat more fruits and veggies.coq10 can be a good supplement but can give people the jitters.coq10 is a good antioxidant but you may opt for a lower dose.try taking melatonin at night.start off with 3mg.if you wake up groggy cut it back to adjust to your tolerance.do not take st.john's wort if you are taking warafin and digoxin and do not take it if taking mao inhibitors.",
