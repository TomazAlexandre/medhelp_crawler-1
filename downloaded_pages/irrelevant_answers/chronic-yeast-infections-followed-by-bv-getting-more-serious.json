            "answer": "As I understand it the biggest cause for yeast infections is actually taking the anti-biotics themselves. When they kill the bad bacteria that are causing the BV, they also kill the good Bacteria in the Vagina. The sugar thing is probably also a problem because high blood sugars increase the sugar level in the Vagina so people like diabetics probably have a big problem with it. Though after looking at a lot of information online I dont really know of any way to prevent an antibiotic-induced yeast infection. I think that you just have to treat it once it starts. It might be other things like Douching, wearing tight clothes or not wiping the right way front to back etc. You could try wearing cotton underwear as I've heard even small things like that can be a help. Maybe if you talked to your doctor about it he could work out a treatment and prevention plan to stop this from happening. Good luck with it and I hope you're well soon =)",

            "answer": "i had a BV before, and my doctor gave me metronidazole for 1 week it was a suppository and it worked, but she told me that it may cause yeast infection cause the antibiotic that she gave me will kill even the good bacteria on my vagina, and\u00a0\u00a0it did, after the BV smelly discharge was taken care of, the itching followed, and some heavy discharge up to now, but the itching were just mild and at the outside, and not during intercourse, so i suppose its ok and it will go away on its own, what i experienced is just like what you have only in reverse... i'm concerned with what you said that you've tried all the natural medication which can rid of yeast infection but it didnt work? even the acidophilus that can bring back the natural bacteria that lives in our vagina to prevent or lessen the possibilities of catching infection did nothing? well then, maybe, you have to consider asking you're family if you have a history of diabetes, or better yet get a blood/sugar count coz this can cause recurrent yeast infection, coz yeast loves to dwell in people with high sugar levels...i wish you well...goodluck...and please consult a different doctor if the first one can't give you the help that you needed...",

    "question": "I'm 47 and healthy. I do not take the pill, have one sexual partner, no STDs. Never had any sign of herpes. I get Chronic yeast infections (for about a year) that respond nicely to Diflucan. (Latex condoms immediately trigger yeast infections in me; I use non-latex now.) Unfortunately, as soon as the yeast infection clears up, it's followed immediately by a bacterial infection. Sometimes there's blood in the discharge. This has been going on for about a year now. I take Flagyl for the BVs.Unsweetened cranberry juice, yogurt, acidophilous pills, tea tree oil, garlic, etc. do not work for me. I have tried every natural remedy (some have made things a hundred times worse) and am at the end of my rope with this.Most recent yeast infection was the worst (symptoms came after eating a lot of sugar the day before). Swollen, red, bumpy labia, itchy beyond belief, painful intercourse. Went to the doctor, confirmed yeast. Took Diflucan, two doses 48 hours apart, then four days later smelly BV discharge. Vagina still swollen and itchy as with the yeast, but less pronounced. Does anyone experience this? What can I do? I prefer natural, if possible.",
