            "answer": "Hi, your symptoms are suggestive of paresthesia of limb. It can be due to nerve compression as seen in carpal tunnel syndrome. This occurs due to increased pressure on the nerve secondary to hereditary, hypothyroidism, obesity etc. The other possibilities are diabetes, vitamin B5 and B12 deficiency and fibromyalgia.Sometimes surgical decompression may be required. A course of vitamin B12 and other B group vitamins can help to alleviate the symptoms. I suggest you to consult a neurologist and get evaluated in detail to rule out the cause and take appropriate treatment.As for sudden wakefulness can be a part of Panic attacks that are something acute or sudden and are characterized by the sudden onset of intense apprehension, fear or terror, and by the abrupt development of Chest pain or discomfort, shortness of breath, palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate and other symptoms.This is common during such circumstances esp. with the family conditions, stress and responsibilities. You need a suggestion therapy and few medications to alleviate the panic reactions. You need to talk freely with closed ones like family or friends. Go for morning walk and relaxation therapy I would suggest you to consult psychiatrist and discuss your problems. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "For the past 2 night, I have had numbness and tingling in my left arm. It feels like it's asleep, and I often awake thinking I've been laying on my arm for too long. And right when I feel like I am about to fall asleep, I have this JOLT that wakes me up suddenly (like when u wake up from a nightmare).My heart feels likes it is beating a little too fast. And even though my body and eyes are extremely tired, the rest of my body feels so strange.I am only 22, very active, not under any stress right now. I don't know why this is happening. Please help!The few people I have asked said it sounds like anxiety, but I don't really know why that would happen when there's nothing really going on in my life.",
