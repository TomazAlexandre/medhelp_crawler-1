            "answer": "hi buddy,due to your active lifestyle, i can think in terms of cartilage damage, chondromalacaie or meniscus injury. No other things fit into the criteria.\u00a0\u00a0MRI will be required for you due to young age and very active life style. the problem with x-ray is that , it shows bone problems only. But other stuffs if knee, it fails to visualize.regards",

            "answer": "I don't really have anything helpful to say; I too have been experiencing sharp pains in my right knee. Like a sharp electric pain.The pains aren't usually often (though there have been several today) and occur when the knee is completely stationary, at rest. I can bear the pain but it's intense enough to force me to cry out.I'm sure I wouldn't be able to reproduce it for the doctor either.I keep looking around for clues - someone suggested \"neuralgia\" - some kind of nerve pain? Maybe connected with diabetes or B12 deficiency or fibromyalgia or some kind of auto-immune disorder?For myself I have to say that some kind of nerve pain sounds like a good description, it doesn't feel like it's in a muscle or tendon.",

    "question": "I have posted my problem a couple times but i haven't gotten a response. I am 33 yrs old, male taekwondo instructor. Iam 5' 8'' and weigh approx 200lbs. within the last 3 weeks i have been getting short but extremely intense stabs of pain in my left knee. The pain originates just to the right of the place where docs usually tap to check reflex action. The pain feels like a jolt of lightning almost and last from 5 to 30 secs. It comes on very suddenly and stops the same way. went to the doctor twice. First he gave me Voltarin forte to take as he could not cause the pain himself during his examination of me knee. The second time (two hours ago) he still cannot produce the pain himself but gave me a cortisone shot and sent me for xray and if that doesnt help then MRI. The pain usually occurs while my leg is at rest 9sitting or lying down) and doesnt seem to be triggered by movement. for the first time though today it has happened a few times while walking today but it has also increased in frequency. please please hypothisize on what it may be because the pain is completely unbearable when i happens.",
