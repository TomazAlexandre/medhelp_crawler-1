            "answer": "I have done research on this, because they thought that my cat had it (I actually have it).\u00a0\u00a0They use the same meds as people use-inhalers that dilate the bronchial tubes with a special contraption that allows it to go over kitty's muzzle.\u00a0\u00a0Prednisone does work great, but the side effects can be very bad-diabetes and a suppressed immune system which will make kitty more vulnerable to infections.\u00a0\u00a0I personally use an INHALED steroid which are much less likely to cause those problems-I'm not sure if these are available to cats or not.\u00a0\u00a0I'd definitely ask the vet about that-it would control your kitty's symptoms and make him/her a much happier kitty!Good luck, and please let me know if they have the inhaled steroids for cats!!!!!",

            "answer": "Hi there...a lot of veterinarians have issues with long term usage of steroids in dogs or cats.\u00a0\u00a0 There is the possibility that continued use of prednisone can cause overactive adrenal glands resulting in too much cortisol in the body (this is one of the body's natural steroids).Since steroids suppress the immune system, llike zodiacqueen has mentioned, chronic recurrent infections can occur.\u00a0\u00a0Other signs are increased drinking and urination, voracious appetite, hair loss, and enlarged belly.The good news is that these signs are more common in dogs than cats, but some veterinarians are just reluctant to take the chance with long term use of steroids.Check out www.aerokat.com to see a version of a feline \"inhaler\"I hope this helps!Tomcat",
