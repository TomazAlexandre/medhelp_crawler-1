            "answer": "Retinal detachments require surgery. However, the type of surgery depends on many factors. You may not necessarily need a scleral buckle. The detachment maybe corrected w/ just a vitrectomy and gas injection. This decision is really up to you & your doctor. There are NO eye drops or other medications that cure a detached retina.If the retina has a small tear you may just need a bit of laser treatment to seal the tear. Laser isn't painful and can be done in a doctor's office.FYI, for more info search the forums and also google retinal detachment.",

    "question": "I am 64 years old, hypertensive but have no diabetes. Back in 2005 I underwent catarct surgey in my right eye.A year later I experienced Retinal Detachment in the same eye. I then had the Scleral Buckling procedure done. Last week I had catarct surgery in my left eye. Now I am recovering post surgery and\u00a0\u00a0I feel the left eye is a lot clearer than the right eye, as the latter has a perpetual blur but has reasonable vision,Now i can read with my right eye without glasses, but cannot read with the left eye without glasses.Distance vision is good in the left eye, but not so in the right eye.Further I also am aware that I am potential candidate for Retinal Detachment in the Left eye. My question is that with adequate precaution and timely action in the event of any signs or symptoms of Retinal Detachment, can the Scleral Buckling be avoided and the repair work be done by application of necessary eye drops and medication. Needless to say the the Scleral Buckling is a painful procedure with prolonged post opeartive discomfort.Look forward to your response.George VargisBangalore. South India.",
