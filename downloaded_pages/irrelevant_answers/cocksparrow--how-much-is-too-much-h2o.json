CS is pretty knowledgeable in all this so waiting for the answer :)As for the dry mouth, YUK taste, metal/chemical taste, etc. , it just goes with tx and don't think 200 gallons of water helps it (tho, yes, you soooo feel it when you drink too little), but that drove me crazy. Couldn't chew enough gum, mints, brush teeth enough! Found lemon drops helped a lot and were 'tasty' even on nausea days.Give them a try.LL",

            "answer": "I'm wondering the same thing myself.I don't start tx till April 8th, but GI Dr. gave me a list of things to do i.e exercise, take multi-vitamin, vitamin E pill, and drink atleast 1 GALLON OF WATER OR JUICE A DAY.This sounds excessive to me. I can drink that much in the summer while working outside all day, but I'll have to force myself to drink that much otherwise.",

            "answer": "Dont really know the answer to this, other than any drug that is water soluable can be diluted if you drink too much water.I just dont like the advice to drink heaps of water, because there is a flip side.What gets tricky is what is too much water.Drinking 2-3 Liters (2-3 quarts roughly. Cant be bothered doing the conversion) is different if you are drinking it in Florida in the middle of summer compared to drinking the same amount in New York in Winter.One could be too much and one not enough.So My advice would be to listen to your body and drink when thirsty but err on the side of less. Just dont go crazy with it, or you may well be flushing all them nasty/lovely drug away.Just a thoughtCS",

But I aint got it. Well dont think i do.That said I dont think the above helped during Tx. As Tx didnt work for me at least.Might be idea to get you Dr to calculate your Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR)Fasting Plama Insulin and Glucose are what used to work it out.All the BestCS",
