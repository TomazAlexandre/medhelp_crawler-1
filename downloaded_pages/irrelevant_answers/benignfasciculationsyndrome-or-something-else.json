            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, stress and anxiety can be a cause. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies or vascular pathologies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Nerve conduction studies should be done. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. There are many other causes of nerve disorder causing pins and needles including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis and G B Syndrome (not possible in your case at all) are two other possibilities. Nerve infections as in Lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Especially get sleep studies done. Take care!",

The hadaches went away last December 10.. So last December 20, 2010 i had this muscle twitching.. It started in my left Quads and now it has spread all over the body.. including my abdominals and deltoids.. i also had this pins and needles feeling in my left arm and leg and burning sensation on my left arm.. the burning sensation and pins and needles disappeared a week ago but my muscles are always twitching... My aunt is a doctor and she says all these symptoms are just stress related and caused by anxiety.. am i just being paranoid or is this something to worry about?",
