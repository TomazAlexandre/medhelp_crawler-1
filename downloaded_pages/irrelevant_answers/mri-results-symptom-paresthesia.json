            "answer": "Hello.The neurologist will be asking you about any other symptoms apart from the ones you mentioned here. Your blood pressure will be checked for hypertension.The choroid fissure cyst is an accidental finding. It is not responsible for any symptoms.The MRI findings will have to be correlated with the clinical examination and history. These findings might also be normal according to your age. Can you mention your age ?Regards",

            "answer": "Hello.The MRI findings can be permanent if infarction has occurred at the site. Your Neurologist is suspecting a blood circulation cause. You should do follow up MRI, may be after a few months, as per his advice. The microangiopathy may resolve, but the damage done by it remains permanent.The vomiting of bulimia nervosa is different from that if an increased ICP. The former is a self induced vomiting, whereas the later is caused by the raised ICP and you can not have a control on it. Raised ICP is not the case with you.The microangiopathy can have a number of causes, from infections to auto-immune diseases. Your Neurologist is in the best position to diagnose. Diabetes is a cause. Do you have your sugars normal ? Did you ever have any blood sugar problems ?Regards",
