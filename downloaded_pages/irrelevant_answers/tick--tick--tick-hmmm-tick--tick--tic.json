Who knows.In the meantime, I'm counting the days. (As I promised myself I wouldn't this month.. yeah, right.):)So, are you both planning on testing before AF is expected, or after?-Heather",

            "answer": "Hey Chloe,We are around the same cycle...I have a bunch of funny things happening(feels like my period is going to start any minute now, my boobs hurt and I have been getting some wicked headaches...The best thing I can suggest is to try to forget about it.\u00a0\u00a0I know you are anxious but if you think about it too much, you will start to see symptoms that are not there and you may convince yourself that you are pg.\u00a0\u00a0If you do that then you will be super disappointed if the hpt comes back negative.\u00a0\u00a0If you set your mind on something else and take the test next week (after not overthinking it) and it comes back + you will be even more surprized than if you had expected it to come back +.Sorry, pretty long winded, Heather...my suggestion, DON'T watch 'A Baby Story'\u00a0\u00a0It'll just drive you nuts!!Kazoo",
