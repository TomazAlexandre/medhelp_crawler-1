    "question": "Hello, I am very concerned about my mother. She suffered a small scratch on the side of her left leg (side of calf) from my father's big toenail while sleeping, back in December of 2015. Treating it as a normal scratch she applied Bacitracin and a Bandaid. The scratch was not healing, so eventually she did have to see a doctor, who then sent her to a wound clinic, and she has been going back and forth from the wound clinic and her regular doctor since January of 2016. Gels and patches have been applied, biopsies have been performed. The last biopsy found that she had a Staph infection, and she was given antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0The wound at this time is getting larger -- it started out the size of a quarter and redness is wrapping around her leg. She is 74, and has Type 2 Diabetes. Blood tests and other tests have confirmed that her blood flow is fine. She will be seeing a vascular doctor this Monday, but I would appreciate more information as this all seems to be taking so long. She has always had the best immune system.",
