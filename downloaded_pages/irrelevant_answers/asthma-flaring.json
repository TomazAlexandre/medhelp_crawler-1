            "answer": "The shortness of breath is due to the anemia that we get...it is DREADFUL and just walking a few feet can seem impossible. I remember that feeling well.It's not \"wheezing\" it's more like your lungs being just too tired to do the breathing.Have you had a CBC to check where your hemoglobin stands? That number is CRUCIAL to keep an eye on during treatment.",

When I got to undetectable at week 12 blood sugar normalized and taken off insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Today, 6 months post tx, sugar in normal ranges A1c about 6.3 and no insulin. Funny thing is I relapsed.\u00a0\u00a0Hard to make sense out of hcv.\u00a0\u00a0Although I expect that if I was to staff off tx sugar would go wonky again.\u00a0\u00a0But I expect to go back to tx in a couple of months.\u00a0\u00a0There is a connecttion between diabetes and hcv, moreso with more liver damage",

This is wierd, but it also felt like the pads of my feet, behind the toes, was swollen too, but it was not visibly noticeable - just a strange feeling. Resolved after tx a couple of months. Originally though it was due to diabetes and blood sugar probalem",
