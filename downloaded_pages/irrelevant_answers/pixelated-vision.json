            "answer": "I didn't realise this condition would be so prevalent but I will post again my pixelated vision here because I want to highlight that this seems to be very common and there is no clear information about why or what it is.I've had speckled, pixelated vision since I was 12 years old in both eyes (I'm 33). I have no idea what the cause is / was. Everything I see day and night is like watching a tv with low resolution, I used to look at the night sky a lot when I was younger, now when I do this I just see millions of dots (orangy in colour flaring). It's not a big deal in the sense that it hasn't changed my life in any significant way. It is pronounced though and I visited an opthamologist recently since I was concerned that it has got worse. The opthamologist I visited found nothing wrong with the eye and along with my optician looked at me as if I was making it up - which is pretty frustrating, I've never had any other health issues. Can anyone shed (non-speckled) light please.",

    "question": "I am 56 tears old and have never had any vision problems other than needing reading glasses beginning in my mid forties.This past year however I have had on three or four occasions the disturbing occurance of pixelated vision.It seems to affect the lower outer edge of my sight spectrum.Both eyes are affected.It does not seem to be a problem with my eyes per sey; that is, if I cover the left\u00a0\u00a0eye, the identicle problem pixelated patern is in the opened right eye and vice versa when the right eye is covered and the left eye opened the same pixelated patern is there.This makes me think the optic nerve and/or the section of the brain responsible for vision are somehow chemicaly or phisically being disturbed or preasured.Has anyone else experianced this problem and had it diagnosed to their satisfaction ?I do not have health insurance and would very much like to know if this is a degenerative condition and what are the dangers, risks etc..",
