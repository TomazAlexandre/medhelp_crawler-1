            "answer": "I just had my gestational diabetes checked last week ... I don't think you messed your results up ... I called and asked an OB/GYN nurse if I should fast and she told me that you don't have to starve for the one hour test, just don't eat or drink anything after you drink the sugar drink. I ate breakfast that morning and my test was fine. good luck!!",

            "answer": "I had icecream the night before my 9am test and I failed it. Then at the 3 hour test the nurse said it was from the sweets I had the night before. So if you do fail it don't worry it's probably a false alarm. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Ugh I did that too. They sent me home with a list of things I couldn't have, and starch was on that list.Well ofcoarse my dumba$$ didn't know at the time that corn was a starch, and pigged out on corn on the cob that my grams had broughten home from the market!!! LOLNeedless to say I failed my 1 hr and hadda go to the 3 hr. I passed that one by the skin of my teeth. I was suspected to have GD with my daughter but went without prenatal care most of my pregnancy with her because Texas Medicaid are the biggest pains in my a$$ EVER!!! And we didn't have a perminent home at the time either.With this pregnancy it did be better to just fast after midnight before my test and I passed my 1hr.But ofcoarse my life is out to get me and I was labeled with mild hypertention.It never ends for me. It really never does. lolJust one thing after the other. JUST when I think I'm fine, I gatta deal with something else. lol",
