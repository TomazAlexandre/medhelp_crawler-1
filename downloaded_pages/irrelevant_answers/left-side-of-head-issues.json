            "answer": "Hi,What you describe is most probably an ear infection and it requires prompt consultation with an ENT specialist. Long use of headsets could have caused it. Is there any discharge or buzzing in your ear? What is important is the ENT specialist needs to rule out any perforation of the eardrum or tympanic membrane. You would be prescribed antibiotics, painkillers and ear drops. Dont worry the chances that this is a tumour or aneurysm are minimal.",

    "question": "I work in a call center environment. We use headsets to talk to customers. About 3 months after i started there i started having problems with the left side of my head. Mainly where the headset rests on my head. I have been having numbing of the left side of the face. Some times it is sensitive when touched like it hurts a little bit. Also it seems like i can hear myself breathing a lot in that ear as well. Like when i swallow i can clear that ear very well and the other ear just seems fine. Lately it is starting to bother me and make me very nervous. Could this be a brain tumor or an anerysm?",
