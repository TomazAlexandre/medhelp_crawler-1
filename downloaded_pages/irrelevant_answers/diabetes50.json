            "answer": "It could be nerve related especially if your blood sugar is not under control. Hopefully you can see your dr and change your medications to help you. There is a medication called Lyrica that can help nerve pain. You have to start taking it gradually, and increase dosage slowly. Doctors will usually start you out with samples to see if it will help you. It can cause you to gain weight tho. I had to stop taking it because of that, as I need to lose weight not gain it. Good luck, and ask your dr.",
