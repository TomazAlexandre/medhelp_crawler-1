            "answer": "That sounds like a low-blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't say if you took some glucose when that happened to you.I have felt like that a few times in my life when my blood sugar has gone pretty low.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diabetic for 27 years and usually do not get lows like that.Or just a thought, do you think it could have been a panic attack?\u00a0\u00a0I have never had one myself--but maybe you could research that.\u00a0\u00a0Are you under a lot of stress?\u00a0\u00a0I would maybe try and think exactly what you ate before the incident and what was happening before the episode happened maybe that will bring you some insight to why it happened.",

            "answer": "Sometimes if our glucose levels get low, especially if the body is stressed enough to produce adrenalin, the liver dumps some stored emergency sugars to try to help us. This could have caused your glucose levels to rise after a severe drop and therefore bring you back to 114 by the time you tested.Another possibility... you don't say when this happened, or how long after a meal, but it is also possible that your insulin worked too quickly while digesting some food, and brought you too low briefly while the food was following the insulin. I have had this happen before, and you feel pretty awful until the food digests to catch up with the insulin. I find that timing sometimes is as important as dosage when it comes to insulin.So those are just two other physical possibilities that I thought I would throw into the suggestion bowl. I hope it was just a low that resolved itself and not panic attacks recurring.",
