I had a strict diet :( no sugars. Yes I'm not going to lie its hard if you are used to eating sweets. I had to be put in meds to lower my sugar level. I hope everything goes good for you. From the bottom of my heart I do hope you don't have gestational diabetes. Let me know how everything goes :) good luck!!",
