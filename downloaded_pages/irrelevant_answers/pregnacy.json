            "answer": "Being a diabetic person should not have any effect on your ability to get pregnant, but it is very important to have those glucose levels under extremely good control while pregnant. Most doctors seem to nowadays want their patients to have extremely good a1c test numbers even before getting pregnant. And to keep those numbers great during the entire pregnancy.The reason is that diabetic women have a slightly greater than normal chance of miscarriages or of birth defects if glucose levels are high. The first few weeks and the very end of the pregnancy are considered the very most important for great glucose control -- the first weeks because the fetus is developing the most at that time, and we don't want anything to go wrong with him or her; and the last part of the pregnancy because high glucose levels can damage the placenta and cause it to not nourish that large baby enough, resulting in loss of the baby near the end of the pregnancy.Now, most of us do just fine. The problems are the rarity, but we do have to be very careful. I had two very healthy babies, and many diabetic women I know have also had very healthy babies. I wish you the same.",
