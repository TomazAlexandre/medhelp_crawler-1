            "answer": "Hello and welcome,I cannot confirm anything without a clinical examination. It may be possible that you have been developing yeast infection in between your buttocks. Yeast infection is common in the skin folds. It is common in people with frequent UTIs and diabetes mellitus. Contact dermatitis is another possibility. In psoriasis the skin appears red, moist and shiny. There is itching and it may split and crack. If this sensitive area is irritated by scratching, it can become infected. Try to avoid scratching it. Your problem has been recurring I will advise you to get it seen by a dermatologist. That will definitely help. Do keep us posted on how you are doing.Take care and regards!",

            "answer": "I have a skin issue that ''sounds\" like psoriasis, BUT it doesn't get the ''flakes''/scales I have heard described/seen. The skin is thick..about a 5\" x 9\" area, and around the main area I have a raised ''border'' of thick skin. It is EXTREMELY painful and tender. I do scratch and even 'gouge' off patched from pencil eraser size to the size of a dime. Some do NOT bleed, others bleed profusely with a very dark blood, I have had these 'flares' last 1-3+ years! It\u00a0\u00a0LOOKS like a fungal infection, has OUTBREAKS like Lichen Planus,, and THICK ITCHY sores like Psoriasis . I notice painful ''nodes/nodules\" , which I gouge off/remove. I am in Pain Mgmt., and was wondering if Hyper Sensitivity Vasculitis may be the issue???\u00a0\u00a0I have seen a Dermatologist , who called it Lichen Planus and treated me with Lidocaine ointment and \"Avo Cream', while my PCP prescribed antibiotics on a daily basis.I also am one of the 2% of people who have Shingles that gets ''reoccurring'' Shingles!!I am a mess and want answers!!!\u00a0\u00a0 I hurt every day/night!!\u00a0\u00a0I have to take narcotic pain meds , which makes it hard to Dx other health issues I have that are also painful.I have IDD/Immune Deficiency Disorder too, so antibiotics of all sorts are always 'on board', along with ativirals and the pain medications. Having Fibromyalgia and AS/Anklosing Sponditis, .PLEASE HELPMy PCP/Primary care doctors tongue tied as to what this really is!!",
