            "answer": "This is a diabetes board. Do you have a question about diabetes? I don't know what you mean by \"blood urea\". Is there any chance you mean blood glucose also known as blood sugar? If so some questions that come to mind would be:Has your father been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes?
