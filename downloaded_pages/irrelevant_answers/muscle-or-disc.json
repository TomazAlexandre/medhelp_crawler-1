            "answer": "Hi, how old are you and any history of diabetes or hypertension. Your symptoms are quite suggestive of sciatica but conditions like kidney disorders (stones, renal colic), prostate pathology and mesenteric infarction should also be ruled out.It can\u2019t be injured muscle as pain won\u2019t last of so long, blood test CPK can be done as this test is quite suggestive of myopathy. Was nerve conduction studies were done by neurologist?",

            "answer": "Thanks for your response.\u00a0\u00a0I am 39 and had a full blood workup and prostate exam last year, plus CT Scan and MRI the year previous, all came back negative for the possibilities you mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0Nerve conduction study was not done by the neurologist.Other than this pain, I am in quite good health...although it has significantly reduced my level of activity.\u00a0\u00a0I have been also presuming that it is sciatica and am beginning another attempt at proceeding through the process of evaluation by a doctor...including physical therapy, pain medication, MRI, X-ray, CT scan, etc....\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to investigate the other possibility I mentioned in my original post.I really appreciate your suggestions.-Tom",

    "question": "Four a little over 4 years I have been experiencing chronic and progressively more severe pain in my right abdomen, right lower back, and the length of my right leg.\u00a0\u00a0The obvious conclusion has been that is is likely sciatica due to a herniated disc.\u00a0\u00a0However, an MRI has proven to show that although I do have a slight herniation of the disc between L5 and S1 but my neurologist at the time stated that it was minor and should not have been causing the pain I was describing.\u00a0\u00a0I am now living overseas and there are language barriers which are reducing my ability to effectively communicate my situation to health professionals in my area.The question I have been pondering is whether or not it is possible for an injured muscle (e.g., a torn or strained gluteus, iliopsoas, and/or a lower back muscle) to become inflamed enough to mimic the symptoms of sciatica due to the inflammation of the area causing pressure on the sciatic nerve.\u00a0\u00a0If this is the case, how could I specifically conclude or eliminate that as the source of my pain?",
