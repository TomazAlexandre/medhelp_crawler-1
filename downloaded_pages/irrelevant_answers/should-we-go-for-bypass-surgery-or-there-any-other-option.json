            "answer": "The American College of Cardiology have guidelines to follow.\u00a0\u00a0Medication is appropriate for CAD if there is relief from any angina (indicates the coronary arteries dilate sufficiently to provide oxygenated blood to the heart cells).Almost always an occlusion less than 70% doesn't require intervention or medication.If medication (some people can't tolerate) does not provide sufficient supply and there is angina, then a stent would be appropriate.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes a stent isn't an option due to location of the lesion, size, and an emergency.\u00a0\u00a0Then CABG (bypass)..QUOTE: \".The area of the LAD shows 80% discrete stenosis at its ostium.... and LCx: shows plaque at its ostium...\"\u00a0\u00a0may be a location that can't be stented.\u00a0\u00a0The LAD and LCx branch off the main coronary artery, and at the junction (the ostium of LAD and LCx) would be difficult to stent as stenting one vessel crowds out the lumen of the other vessel.\u00a0\u00a0I don't believe the technology provides a \"Y\" stent!?The other lesions should not be a problem and with proper diet, exercise, lipid levels controlled, etc. there may not be any progression with medication.\u00a0\u00a0I have a totally blocked LAD (collateral vessels provide a natural bypass) and LCx is 72% blocked.\u00a0\u00a0I have been successfully treated for 5 years with medication and feel well.Talk to a non-inverventional cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0CABG should be the last resort.",

            "answer": "Risks are higher fior individuals with following:Age -- patients over 70 are at a slightly higher risk for complicationsGender -- women have a slightly higher riskHaving another serious medical condition (such as diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, kidney disease, or lung disease)Previous heart surgery -- puts a person at a higher riskPossible risks include: Blood clots; Death (very small risk); Heart attackSternal wound infection (this complication most often occurs with obesity, diabetes, or having had previous CABG); Stroke (the risk is greatest in those over 70).About a third of patients have \"post-pericardiotomy syndrome\" a few days to 6 months after surgery. The symptoms of this syndrome are fever and chest pain. It can be treated with medication. The surgery site in the chest or the graft site (if the graft was from the leg or arm) can be itchy, sore, numb, or bruised. Some people report memory loss and loss of mental clarity or \"fuzzy thinking\" after CABG.",
