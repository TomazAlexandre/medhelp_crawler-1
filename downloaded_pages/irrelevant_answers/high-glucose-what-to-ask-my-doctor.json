            "answer": "Serum Insulin was \"9\". Normal is <17.-----------Unrelated: Platelets: \"161\" which is similar to pre-treatment. I would have thought platelets would rise post treatment due to a healing liver. Anyone notice any changes in platelets one way or the other from pre to post treatment?",

            "answer": "hi jim,my platelets went down on treatment, from 348 to 200.i know they'll take at least six mnoths to get back to normal.In your case, we know it took more than 20 YEARS for your platelets to get from near 300 to 160s.\u00a0\u00a0So, common sense says that it will take YEARS for them to get anywhere near that level.\u00a0\u00a0(when damage takes that long, reversal must take at least half as long, right?)",

I'm one year post treatment now so expected my platelets to rise based on what I think might be some fibrotic reversal. I'll mention to my liver specialist next month but his answer to most of these questions is \"that's normal, don't worry\" sort of what I tell you most of the time :)-- Jim",

However, this has nothing to do with SVR, I think it might have to do with bleeding. Volatern will not compromise your SVR in any way. Not to worry. As to Aloe Vera gel, never heard it could compromise SVR. I've tried it for my stomach inflammation but haven't noticed anything positive or negative. How long does it take to work. I've been using the liquid, not the gel per say. Health food store guy said they're similar.",

            "answer": "I don't know much about serum insulin. I assume that if your serum insulin is normal or high and your glucose is also high that means you are insulin resistant. You are producing enough insulin but it is ineffective or less effective than it should be. Since your BG is not really elevated much I wouldn't think that you have an insulin resistance issue. But, that's just off the top and I could be way off. I don't think that your BG is anything to lose sleep over - I'd just watch it and my diet and exercise. Mike",

            "answer": "My experience has been that my platelet count never got very far above low normal with the exception of right after my motorcycle accident. I was on drugs that cautioned about platelet drop yet mine went from 140 - 150,000 into the 240,000 range. My PCP said that can occur after severe trauma and that mine would get back to my \"normal\" in a month or 2. That's exactly what happened. You're normal so I wouldn't worry about it. I think as we age a high platelet count might not be all that good - I'm thinking stroke possibility. If my clotting time is good that's all I care about.I would watch my carb intake with a glucose reading like yours. You know everything I could say about exercise and carbohydrates. They say wine can decrease blood sugar and I think I may have seen that in my situation. But, I am diabetic so hypoglycemia can and does rear it's head from time to time. I also wonder about reefer's affect on blood sugar - does it lower it?\u00a0\u00a0I tend to believe that it may. Am I getting into real trouble here Jim? I really don't care if I am. These are things that have occurred to me and there isn't a lot of information about either of these agents and their impact on blood sugar -in particular reefer and glucose. I wonder why that is. I'd be careful if I were you Jim and I'd be happy that I treated successfully before these negative predictors surfaced - if, in fact, they are. I think that is one factor that isn't stressed enough when deciding whether to treat - the negative predictors associated with aging. Mike",

            "answer": "I ain't no gluco-ologist, but I really don't think your numbers are that out of line at all. Slight, occasional variations outside of defined norms usually aren't terribly meaningful in of themselves from my learnins'. Type II diabetics can have numbers soaring way, way above a mere 100 or 104. And what about that A1C blood sugar history test (or whatever they call it), did you get that done?\u00a0\u00a0And like Flguy says, the fasting time is important. You say you fasted between 10AM and 1PM? That's not a long fast, usually when I'm told to fast prior to a blood draw they tell me at least 8 hours is required. This is usually orchestrated by having the last meal before going to bed, and then get up and go straight to the hospital in the morning without breakfast (with a growling stomach). Do you recall what you typically ate prior to getting your blood draws? Starchy and sugary foods prior to the draws could also elevate the glucose a bit above normal. Also, I think it's normal for most people to lose at least a little of their insulin sensitivity as they get older (as you probably know insulin is how your body internally regulates sugar levels). Especially in those that have experienced a long history of liver disease (even if it's now resolved). I pretty much expect to eventually develop some type of insulin insensitivity, or outright type II diantes later in life due to my infection with HCV (even if I SVR soon). My dad developed type II diabetes in his mid-50's (he completely manages it with diet and exercise today though), so there is a genetic component too. Anyone in your direct family have any form of blood sugar problems or diabetes?",
