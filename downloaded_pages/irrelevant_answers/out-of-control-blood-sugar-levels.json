            "answer": "Yes, please go back to the hospital. This level is terribly high.It would seem that he needs to be on insulin already if he can't control his sugars on oral meds.If you have to wait to see a doctor, you need to cut out the carbs until he can be seen.Lower carb diet actually works well to help control blood sugars.Educate yourself and your husband.\u00a0\u00a0It is a steep learning curve, but it can be done.",

            "answer": "High glucose levels are proven to lead to major health complications - cardio unrest to neurothapy to amputation - especially levels above 300 which are considered very dangerous. One cannot eat whatever they want and expect diabetes medication to perform miracles. They are taken to help/assist the patient gain control, helping those who make lifestyle changes with proper diabetes nutrition, daily physical exercise, and maintaining proper weight.I agree, go back to the hospital and ask for insulin. Read up and educate both yourself and your husband on how and when to use it, especially on dosage times.",
