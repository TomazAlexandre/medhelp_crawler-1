            "answer": "Caffiene is what effects your baby. I dont know any specifics, but the things we are told not to eat have negative effects such as mental retardation. So I just steer clear as much as possible. Breastfeesing is healthier for both mom and baby. You will shed any weight faster while bf and it's proben to be extremely beneficial to baby. Cloth diapers are cheaper in the long run. I personally am not going to use them due to my lack of wanting to clean poop off of them and carry poop around in my bag.",

            "answer": "I'm due in July too. Well I prefer the healthy route if yu crave sweet drink juice in stead of soda the only soda o drink once in a while is ginerale. From a Dr point breast feeding is more healthier to help the baby get all the antibodies from the mother but after a while from what my friends told it gets fustrating as they get older, they drink more and sometimes dnt have enough milk or it hurts really bad from them sucking on ya nipples some much. I plan to beast feed at least the first 3mo. I thought about cloth but it is expensive and very time consuming to clean and keep on top of to make sure yu dnt run out. To kill time and buying lots of soap disposal diaper are best and pampers brand is made of cotton so that the close you'll get to cloth.",

            "answer": "I have heard if you drink a lot of caffeine that one cup a day wont hurt but its after that. So sometimes i still enjoy a cup of coffee here and there. And breastfeeding is def better for both mom and baby.\u00a0\u00a0It actually lowers your risk in getting breast cancer and such. I disagree that it is so time consuming depending on the baby. I know mine ate for 5-10 minutes and was done but there were stories from friends that their baby ate for hours. So it depends. And the older they get the easier im still breastfeeding my 14 month old once a day.",
