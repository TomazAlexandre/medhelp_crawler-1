            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If a scab forms and falls off on and off, then what you have is probably a non healing ulcer. This can be a venous ulcer on a varicose vein or any other ulcer that does not heal well due to either poor blood supply or underlying diabetes. Wounds heal slower in diabetics or smokers or alcoholics who have been drinking for a long time. So these have to be ruled out.Hence the origin of the ulcer has to be determined. Duplex ultrasound of the calf done to rule out varicose veins and atherosclerosis and blood sugar tested.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Take care!",

    "question": "About 7 years ago, I got a scab on my calf. I don't remember how it got there. It went away after about 5 months, but left a scar... Since then the \"scar\" falls off about every couple years and takes a long time to heal. I don't have insurance, and I was just wondering if this has happened to anyone else, and if you know what it is? I have never heard of a scar falling off and scabbing over repeatedly like this.",
