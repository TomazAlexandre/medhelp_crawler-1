    "question": "Last August I was diagnosed with a tumour on the pituitary gland:prolactinoma.I've been taking bromocriptine since then and one of the side effects (as far as I understand it)is to reduce blood pressure. The dose I'm on now is 15mg, reduced from 20mg.I have to take care when standing up,as I might feel dizzy, and my hands and feet to go white and dead unless I take great care to keep warm at all times.I have other symptoms as well: complete lack of appetite (I've lost 12lbs since I began the treatment), tiredness and a very pale face.I also have night-sweats and very disturbed sleep pattern.My question is this: could ALL my symptoms possibly be related to the low blood pressure, or should I worry about other possible reasons? By the way, I've had a blood test recently which suggests that the production of prolactin has reduced, therefore that the tumour has done likewise.",
