            "answer": "Hi, Shiba.\u00a0\u00a0I have some experience with animals.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds to me like the seizures he had in the past were diabetes-related, and you now have that part under control.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin can cause above-average thirst, thus the frequent urination, and (on a side note) weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Being hospitalized causes a certain amount of stress for all animals kept there.\u00a0\u00a0It's good that you are trying to get him to eat.\u00a0\u00a0If he continues not to eat and the doctor is concerned, liquid food can be given through a tube put down his throat (that is not as awful as it sounds.\u00a0\u00a0Another term for this would be 'force feeding'.\u00a0\u00a0I was a vet tech for 8 years, and saw how animals react to being in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The first day, they are usually restless, but then they calm down and warm up to the people who care for them, once they realize that they are not going to be hurt.\u00a0\u00a0Strange thing is this: you love him and want to see him, just as much as he does, and that is great.\u00a0\u00a0BUT I have seen that visits from owners that do not result in getting to go home results in a new bout of stress one the owner leaves.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep this in mind.\u00a0\u00a0If you want to bring special foods for the nurses to try, you can drop it off at the front desk.\u00a0\u00a0Also having something that you have worn against your skin and not washed is comforting for animals: just ask the hospital staff NOT to wash it, unless it becomes very soiled, then you bring another one for him.\u00a0\u00a0Blessings and prayers for you both - Blu",

    "question": "I have a 15 year old Shiba Inu who has suffered from seizures in the past.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, he was on anti-biotics, anti-inflammatory, a stomach ailment, and a pain killer for what looked like open wounds on his paws.\u00a0\u00a0The pills have side effects unfortunately and about a week ago, he was diagnosed as a diabetic with high keotone numbers, +2, and high glucose levels.For the past 3 days, he has received fluids and insulin shots at the animal hospital.\u00a0\u00a0He came home with a pic in his front leg so they could hook him up to an iv the next day.\u00a0\u00a0Today, I took off of work because my family and I want to see if some of the effects he's been suffering from are caused from anxiety of being in a cage and at the vets when he never usually is caged up.It seems, almost like clockwork, he wakes up every 3-4 hours and starts whining and pacing.\u00a0\u00a0I put him outside and he pees.\u00a0\u00a0He has also gone #2, however he doesn't eat much more than peanut butter right now and I am going to try to get him to eat some chicken/turkey/cheese later today.He's been eating lots of ice chips, drinking water, and urinating a lot.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to see him eat.\u00a0\u00a0The vet said with his glucose #'s around 400, that another week and a half of in house treatment may stabilize the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The good news is that the keotone numbers are just trace amounts now and his other blood work looks fairly normal.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor gave us a liquid syringe of a substance we have to shake well and then put in his mouth to calm his stomach.The most cause of concern is that I want him to eat and how he wakes up every 3-4 hours almost crying/whining and pacing then he'll settle back in and be content as can be.\u00a0\u00a0What is going on with my little buddy?",
