            "answer": "you know copy, I think we need a disclaimer in here for the metformin only for certain patients.\u00a0\u00a0The more I read about the drug the more concerned I got for myself as a patient.The reason was that at stage 4, and with allergy to lactose, the chances for lactid acidosis do go up.In general, I think most patients would benefit from adding the metformin during tx. The main contraindication would be impaired flow already existing in the liver, and then the issue become more of a connundrum due to the fact that any acidosis adds to fibrosis whereas normally the liver would benefit from the lower insulin, it won't if LA kicks in.I should add this is rare however, and not an issue for many people.Since my absorption of any lactate was already an issue I had to opt out of the metformin solution.I choose instead to go first with byetta, then victoza due to dosing issue.These drugs more closely resemble the chemistry that slows digestion in nature, and do work to lower BS.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately they also seem to cause more thyroid issues, and I have succoumbed to having a parathyroid adenoma, although proving this was a result of these drugs is questionable. I began having the \"shakes\" while on RIBA/INF and before adding them, so the liklihood is that the chemo may have set this in motion....(riba is carcinogenic as well).In any case, I think for stage 1 and 2 folks the addition make impeccable sense, but less so in stage 3, and little in stage 4. Just my opinion, and especially is lactose metabolism is also an issue.It's always great news to find drugs that benefit us, and do a better job than previous methods, but we have to inform ourselves fully as to their strengths and weaknesses.This is especially true with the newer solutions, just check out the Avandia fiasco to know how true that is.Unfortunately newer is not necessarily better and for this reason I think Metformin is a safer bet for most people, at least the research and the long track record are there to help us decide with enough information to make things less of a gamble.and yes, the parathyroid gland comes out in 2 days!!\u00a0\u00a0Yippeee!!!!!!!eemb",
