            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Inadequate oxygenation can produce symptoms of breathlessness, as the body tries in an effort to compensate for the decreased oxygen supply. The breathlessness could be due to cardiac or lung disorders. Breathlessness on exertion could be due to the decreased lung function. Again in cardiac disorders the heart is unable to pump the blood adequately, more so when subjected to stress like exercise. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. Breathlessness in sleep could also be due to sleep disorders like obstructive sleep apnea.After an EKG or a treadmill test your doctor may have asked for an agiogram to rule out a cardiac cause for the symptoms. He may even ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation. A sleep study may help rule out obstructive sleep apnea.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
