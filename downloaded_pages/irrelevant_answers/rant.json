    "question": "I'm so fed up with my boyfriend lately. He's usually the most caring and understanding person in the world. We currently live with his mum and it's an absolute nightmare. Iv managed to save up and get us a place to move into at theend of the month. He seemed really pleased that we would be a family unit. But since we found out we are moving he's been erratic. Spending all his money on bike or car parts and today he vandalised one of our living room units in storage so his bike could stand on the plywood. We can't afford new units!I had to go to hospital today for emergency blood tests and doctors believe I might have gestational diabetes. He hasn't asked how I or his baby are and of it went ok. My blood pressure is sky high because of stress and he just doesn't listen. He's taking what's left of our money to go to a car show tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I'm so confused and down. Sorry for the essay.",
