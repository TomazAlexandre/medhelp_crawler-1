            "answer": "Hi,You do have a higher risk give your family history but you are doing some very good things to start heading this off at the pass--you are slender, trying to exercise and hopefully eating a healthy diet. Not smoking is also a good idea.Your symptoms may not have anything to do with diabetes but the best way to find out is to have a 2-hour glucose challenge test done. This will not only tell you if you have diabetes but also milder forms of glucose handling problems like Impaired Glucose Tolerance (which is also associated with diabetes later in life).In the meantime try to increase your exercise to 30-45 minutes five times a week of at least a brisk walk.\u00a0\u00a0Cutting sweets is always a good idea, as well as saturated fats. You do not need to restrict carbohydrates, just be sure to have a balanced diet with lots of fiber, veggies and fruit.Hope this helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "Also, in regard to your blood sugar testing--if you wish to do so, you can purchase a simple meter from the drug store and start checking in the morning before eating and definitely when you have any symptoms that concern you(shakiness, drowsiness).\u00a0\u00a0The best way to know for sure is to simply check!",

    "question": "My dad's mother was diagnosed Type 2 shortly before she passed away several years ago, then my uncle (blood relative (also passed away), and my dad just about 4 years ago after suffering a heart attack. (Grandma passed away from general organ failure - I'm pretty sure it wasn't a diabetes related death and my uncle had been a bed-ridden patient for nearly 20 years and obese).\u00a0\u00a0I've got a sneaky suspicion that I will one day be Type 2, but should I monitor my own blood sugar?I'm generally in good health, BMI about 23, and I'm trying to exercise more, about 20 mins each day.\u00a0\u00a0Something is better than nothing!\u00a0\u00a0I did get a bunch of blood work done after dad had his bypass, but the Dr. said everything was fine.\u00a0\u00a0I do fit some of the symptoms, the tiredness - esp. after sugar/carbs - crankiness when I don't eat and then extreme tiredness when I pass hunger.\u00a0\u00a0Going to the bath room / drinking, well, I am trying to drink more liquids, mostly water, so I don't think its because I'm thirsty.",
