    "question": "I have had a problem sleeping with the air any colder than 82 to 85 degrees. It needs to be this hot or I can't get to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0My body needs a fan at the high temps but my throat and lungs need the extreme heat.Besides not sleeping ,I get very sick. First my throat and then my chest gets congested .\u00a0\u00a0I just did a sleep test and they seem puzzled that I didn't fall asleep at 69 degrees and that I needed it 85 degrees but I was very hot without a fan so it still kept me up.I can't find anything on this and have wondered why I have so much problem with only my throat and chest needing the heat while the rest of my body needs a fan for lower temps .",
