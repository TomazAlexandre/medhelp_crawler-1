    "question": "Hi all,I am a female who about 6 months ago had sex with a condom on several occasions with a man whom I've known for a while.\u00a0\u00a0On at least two occasions I noticed in between while rubbing the water based lube on his condom that it was moving as I rubbed it on, I had to hold one end so that it would not slide too far.\u00a0\u00a0At the time I didn't know to exchange it out for a new one anyhow I am unsure of his status and wondered what are the risks. Also I noticed that he was not holding the condom when he pulled out and it never slipped off or tore, and at the time of removal the condom was snug on or close to the base, but this has truly worried me for monthsI\u00a0\u00a0Primarily because he is very promiscous and has used drugs not intravenous though.\u00a0\u00a0Please tell me what you think the risks are if he had HIV.",
