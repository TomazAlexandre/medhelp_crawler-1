            "answer": "I agree with the above. If your doctor isn't worried, you don't need to be either.Just keep taking your pre-natals. Andi think at this time in your pregnancy you're supposed to add a calcium supplement since the baby's bones are hardening. If you don't get enough calcium, the baby will take calcium from your bones.Lastly, with diabetes, I think you're supposed to keep your weight down. So the fact that you have only gained a modest amount of weight recently might be a good indication to your doctor. All my friends who had gestational diabetes had to watch what they ate very carefully and they barely gained any weight during the pregnancy.",
