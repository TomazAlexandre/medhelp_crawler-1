            "answer": "Hi!Well yes, narrow stool along with constipation and diarrhea can be symptoms of colon cancer. However, you can also get loose stools if you use a stool softener. So, yes, colonoscopy is warranted. However, you must also rule out other causes of chronic constipation.Apart from colon cancer, chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders such as colitis, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. Please discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

The Colorectal surgeon said I have a twisty colon in 2 spots and recommends diet changes with more fiber, more water and to follow up if problems persist.
