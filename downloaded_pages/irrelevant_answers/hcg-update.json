            "answer": "I feel exactly the same way. It was a little worse earlier on in my pregnancy (I'm 13 weeks), but I still notice it. I try to keep stuff around that is low in calories and fat. My favorites have been pretzels, fruit snacks, graham crackers... Really anything I can eat a little bit of, just to keep my blood sugar up, really, really kept me from getting sick.I haven't ever gotten sick during the day, because I am good at controlling it, only in the mornings, because I just can't eat right when I get up.And I have stayed at about the same weight. I lost a couple pounds in the first 6 or 7 weeks, and I have slowly gained them back, so I am still right around my pre-pregnancy weight. Just as long as you still keep an eye on your portions and don't over-do it, I think you'll be fine.Good luck, and congrats!!",
