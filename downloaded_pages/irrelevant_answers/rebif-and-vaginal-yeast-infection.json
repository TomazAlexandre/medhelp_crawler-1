            "answer": "I was on Rebif successfully for about 7 years and all of the sudden, I was getting yeast infection-like symptoms. This went on for 7 months. I went to 3 different doctors, multiple appointments and they kept telling me, &quot;You are fine.&quot;\u00a0\u00a0I was tested for everything and they could not figure it out. It ended up being the Rebif. I did notice a jelly like discharge or thin clear discharge but it had never bothered me. Then it started burning. I stopped the Rebif and went back to normal. I did have one actual yeast infection since -it seems this whole process really threw off the chemistry of my vaginal area. Talk to your MS doc. Perhaps stopping and giving yourself a break may help. I&#39;ve been stable and may never go back on any medication after this experience. Trying to treat it with the Wahls Protocol.",
