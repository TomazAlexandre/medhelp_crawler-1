            "answer": "Since you have gd the baby might be a lot when its born so you would have to get a cesarean. If you go at 38 weeks the baby will be fully developed and not weigh as much so this way you can have a vaginal birth. But go with your gut, if you feel something isn't right i would talk to her about it",
