            "answer": "I wish I could be of more assistance. Without knowing the type of doctor your little girl is seeing, what he/she suspects, I can only suggest you see a Pediatric Endocrinologist, some one who specializes with the Endocrine System where diabetes is better understood.There's a lot of missing information in your post making it difficult to answer. You failed to mention what \"some tests show good signs and other not so good.\" are, their results, what they gave your daughter for the glucose test, how much, what each hour test results were, and why they monitored for 5 hours when normal glucose testing for adults\u00a0\u00a0is 1, 2 and 3 hours. And, how much is \"trace of Ketone\"? From a swab, or urine sample.",

    "question": "My 17 month old child has had a series of test ran to determine if some of the symptoms that I noticed may determine if she had diabetes. Her A1c came back at 6.4 (recommended 6.0), glucose 80, and it showed that she had a trace of Ketone in her urine. This is confusing to me because a 5 hour glucose test was performed and there was only one hour where her levels went out of range to 128. I am not sure what to do next because some tests show good signs and other not so good. Is there a doctor out here that can clarify this for me?This discussion is related to/posts/show/644779.",
