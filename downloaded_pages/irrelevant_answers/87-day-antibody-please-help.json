            "answer": "87 days is conclusive no matter what situation ? And no matter what type of antibody test was used ? Also you can say for sure that I can continue to try to conceive a child with my wife. Btw does dry peeling skin on hands have anything to do with hiv ? I'm sorry for the follow up questions I was doing so well where I was once so nervous but for some reason it had crepped back in",

    "question": "hi i had a relativly low risk encounter condom break with african american csw, only exposed for mere seconds. had a total of 4 antibody tests done 4,6,8 and 87 days. the 4 and 6 were rapid one was oral fluid one was finger prick. the 8 and 87 day ones were lab based done through quest diagnostic. All came back negative after my 87 day negative i did not give hiv another thought for months now as i have passed the 6 month since time of event it has slowly creeped back into my mind. i cant seem to shake the feeling that i should test again. i have begun having unproctected sex with my wife again as we are trying to concieve. please can anyone give me there opinion on wheither i should go back take a final 6 plus month test. Is it ever really neccessary is 87 days conclusive, i have no idea what type of antibody test it was meaning what generation i know for sure it wasnt 4th. i also was just diagnosed with diabetes. and have had strange tingling fingers and feet recently as well as a strange almost thrush looking tounge. now i am not a doctor so i dont assume it is trush but i am going to my gp to get an opinion on it. the same gp who at 87 days told me that i must move past it. any insight would be greatly appeciated ? i'd especially like if teak, nursegirl, joggen or lizzie some of the more experienced board members could comment. thanks paul",
