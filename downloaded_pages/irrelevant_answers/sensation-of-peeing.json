            "answer": "Hi,There\u2019s a possibility of a stone in the urinary tract which is causing these symptoms of what we call tenesmus, in which there\u2019s an uncontrollable urge to urinate but when one goes to the washroom only a few drops actually come out or none at all. For the same, I\u2019ll suggest getting an ultrasound or rather CT-IVU to rule out the presence of a stone disease. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "Hi,A stone in the urinary bladder can give rise to such symptoms of recurrent urge to urinate especially at night as the stone tends to irritate the bladder wall making the patient visit the toilet again & again. You don\u2019t need to take any medication right now and get yourself evaluated. Please get a urine analysis, urine specific gravity & Blood sugar also done as other common causes like diabetes mellitus & diabetes inspidus also need to be ruled out. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
