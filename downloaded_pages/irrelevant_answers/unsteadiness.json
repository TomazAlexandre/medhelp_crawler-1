            "answer": "I also have a hx of migraine plus the little lesions you mention. This is called small vessel disease. Migraine, diabetes and hypertension can put you at risk for this. Yes, unsteadiness can be the result of these lesions, because they are in fact very tiny strokes.",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 42 year old female with a history of migraine headaches with aura.\u00a0\u00a0Lately, i've been having episodes of unsteadiness which I am not sure if it could be related to the migraines or something other.\u00a0\u00a0It happens probably a couple of times a day and feels like I am tipping over, but I am not. It lasts a couple of seconds.\u00a0\u00a0It also feels like someone is pushing down on me.\u00a0\u00a0I get this when I do not have a migraine.\u00a0\u00a0I usually get migraines 2-3 times a month.\u00a0\u00a0I had an MRI last year which revealed lesions on the white matter of the brain, which is probably related to migraine activity.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think these lesions could be causing this symptom or any thoughts of what may be?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
