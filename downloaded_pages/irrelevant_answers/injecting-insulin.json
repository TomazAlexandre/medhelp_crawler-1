            "answer": "In short - nothing.Basically what happened is that the syringe hit a blood vessel on the way in or out and that burst.\u00a0\u00a0No big deal.\u00a0\u00a0It will happen occassionally with any shot not just insulin.\u00a0\u00a0No harm will be done.\u00a0\u00a0This is fairly normal.",
