            "answer": "Hi,Was there confirmatory test or culture done? Onychomycosis or tinea unguium is a fungal infection of the nail bed, matrix or plate. Toenails are affected more often than fingernails and occurs primarily in adults, most commonly after 60 years of age. Treatment for a fungal nail infection includes using medications, taking steps to prevent the infection from returning, and removing the affected nail. However, treatment does not work for 20% to 25% of people with the condition. It is important to confirm the diagnosis of onychomycosis\u00a0\u00a0by potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation, culture or histology. Culture reports often identify multiple organisms, including possibly nonpathogenic molds, and treatment should be directed at the organisms most likely to be causative.To improve treatment outcomes and prevent recurrence,\u00a0\u00a0the following may help:\u00a0\u00a0wear dry cotton socks and change them often; choose breathable footwear; protect feet in shared bathing areas; keep feet dry throughout the day; recognize and treat tinea pedis; avoid injuring the nail, and maintain and improve chronic health conditions such as diabetes control and\u00a0\u00a0smoking cessation.
