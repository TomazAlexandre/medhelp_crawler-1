            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!First of all since you have widespread fungal infection and get tired easily you must be sure that you do not have diabetes. If fasting and two hour after food blood samples show normal results, get a glucose tolerance test done. Get your kidney function tested too.Systemic fungal infection is possible such as Candidiasis, Aspergillosis, Histoplasmosis, Blastomycosis, and Coccidioidomycosis. However these are seen in immunocompromised patients such as those on chemotherapy, dialysis, renal dysfunction, HIV, or other STDs. Rarely this is seen in healthy individuals. Sandwich ELISA for circulating galactomannan and Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for diagnosis of Candida infections and even unusual species are used for diagnosis.Yeast infection or thrush is at times very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks along with local application of antifungal cream. There are many types of antifungals available. Take an OTC antifungal with a combination of two or more anti fungals. Use both oral and local application. In your case both partners need to be treated. Test for diabetes and other STDs as presence of either or both can make it difficult to treat the fungal infection. Various reasons for recurrent fungal infection is incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, co-existing dermatitis, diabetes and low immunity. Please discuss with a dermatologist and an internal medicine specialist and take the full course of treatment preferably with a combination of antifungals to prevent resistance.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Some of these symptoms could be associated with accutane. Don't blame your parents/doctor. They did what they thought was right for u at the time. Blaming won't help u get better. Have u seen a dermatologist....they would know how to help some of the accutane side effect. (Dry eyes/skin/muscle aches +pain/stomach symptoms/fatigue/spaciness). I assume u r not taking this now. The yeast infection will go back and forth between u and your girlfriend unless u both get treated on the same day(s) and don't have sex till the treatment is successful in both of u. It sounds like your immune system is depressed as u have fungal infection in several places on your body Mouth/groin/hair and a possible urinary infection. Did any of your blood tests show anything. I would NOT give up on your doctor. If u r not happy with the way they are handling things go to a new doctor, taking all your results with u. I don't think u have a systemic fungal infection, but u most certainly need further evaluation. Your girlfriend also needs evaluation, to ensure she actually has a fungal infection and not something else. I really hope this can be solved for u and I hope someone else replies to u that has had something like this and gotten well again",

    "question": "Hi everyone,I realize this got a bit long, but I wanted to list as much as possible. This is really serious and I need some help/advice on what to try next.I was on accutane for a year when I was 16. Since that time I have had nothing but problems. I was always healthy, and still try to do the things I love to do like hockey, but I'm getting to a point where I cannot keep living like this. It just keeps getting worse. I am now 22 and things have been getting a lot worse for the last 3 years. I have been to a countless amount of doctors, and I have gotten absolutely nowhere.My symptoms seem to just be adding on by the year. It started with what was like sand in my hair. I was at the beach for a few weeks and thought it was just sand. After a bunch of showers I started to realize it wasn't sand.I have had horrible back pain in my lower back, as well as times where my entire back just goes out.About 3 years ago my girlfriend got a yeast infection, and I showed no signs of that. I started to have stomache pains, diareha, gas, britel finger nails, rough hair. I then went out drinking and the next morning had my first hangover. I threw up lots and it was bad. After that I started to get really bloated. Like a ridiculous amount of bloating. My groin would get really itchy if I would do anything. I started getting ridiculously thirsty when I would wake up and had very bad breath (I never had bad breath before this). My eyes like glue shut when I wake up as well. I would rub them and it wouldn't go away for about 30 minutes. They almost always burn if I get water in them. Most days I just need to go back to bed and all through my sleeps I need to wake up and chug water (I was tested for diabetes-negative).Then I started to get really really tired all of the time. Then I started to have a lot of pain in my joints where I never had any pain. I noticed this lots at hockey. My back has just been a constant mess since and I barely do anything but sleep now pretty much.I then started to notice that my tongue was like white. It never was like this before and it's not like anyone elses that I know. It is just like all white and bumpy at the back.Now the last 2 months I went to an outdoor concert, and at the end of the day I felt like my inner thighs/groin had razor blades on them. I got home and had a pretty bad rash. I tried some basic stuff like penaten and it kind of went away a bit, but remained pretty itchy/sore if I did anything. Then I got an infection in my wisdom tooth and took antibiotics for that. Within days I had oral thrush, and the sore itchyness in groin was back 10x worse with red rash and red raised spots. Looks like jock itch.Now you have no idea how frustrated I am. I feel like if I had more energy (to even get out of bed most days) I would sue Accutane to have some money to figure out what is wrong with me! I'm very angry that my doctor got me on it, and that my parents didn't say no. My doctor seems absolutely clueless whenever I see her, and I go sometimes like 6 months where I try to just deal with things because it is that pointless to talk to her. I have had countless tests including blood work, std tests, cystoscopy, ultrasounds, etc.The thing that brings me to internal yeast infection is that my girlfriend started to experience a really bad pain during sex whenever we did it and discharge. She has tried a bunch of treatments for that, but from my understanding, even if she cleared that up, I would be giving it back to her if I had it. That has been constant since all of this got bad for me.So I have no idea what to do. I'm not really out of shape, I just feel horrible all of the time. I'm always cloudy and when all of this started I couldn't feel anything for a while. I remember complaining lots to my parents that I just felt so out of it. everything is a fog, and it makes it really hard to do anything. The worst has to be the jock itch right now and the dryness of mouth/eyes. My eyes also hurt on the computer now and that's not good because I am a web developer and that's what I do for a living!Is there anyone out there that has experienced anything like this? Is there something I can try? Should I try to get my doctor to look for yeast? She doesn't seem to want to, and it looks like systemic yeast infections they don't consider real?? I have every symptom of it, and I only got onto that when I realized that jock itch is a yeast infection.This message is just getting too long to talk more of my symptoms.Here is a quick list (there are more):- Jock Itch- Whiteish Tongue- Oral Thrush- Hair Dandruf (sand like- sometimes looks like dried blood)- Rough Hair (used to be smooth)- puffy red penis hole - meatus (Urologist said it's normal, but it looks like my **** had a stroke and I didn't have this before all of this crap)- bad breath- Stomache Bloating- gas- sore stomache, sometimes stabbing pain- constipation & diareha. Never seems to be just normal- Fatigue (extreme & especially after eating)- out of it (spacey)- tired & thirsty after eating- Always Thirsty- Extreme dryness in eyes and mouth/throat when I wake up- Blurry sore eyes morning- Sore eyes (reading, comp, etc.)- Back pain (Sometimes really serious pain for weeks at a time)- Cloudy Urine (smells bad as well. Almost like rawting eggs mixed with metal)- Ocasional burning urine- Joint/muscle pain/fatigue- I get drunk extremely easy. 200lb guy and somedays I can be drunk off of 1.5 beers.Hopefully I get some response. I have no idea what to do now. I just want to feel good again. I honestly forget how that feels!Thanks for your time. I hope someone here can help me.",
