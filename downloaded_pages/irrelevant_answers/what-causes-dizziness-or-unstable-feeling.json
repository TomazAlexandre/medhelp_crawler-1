            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dizziness and unstableness that occurs due to standing up could be due to postural or orthostatic hypotension. The blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
