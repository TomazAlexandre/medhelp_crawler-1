            "answer": "Infection would be the most common condition that needs to be ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0A urinalysis as well as a prostate exam would help with this.If there continues to be pain and discomfort, you can consider a cystoscopy - which is a scope that can comprehensively evaluate the lower GI tract.Incontinence can also be caused by diseases like diabetes and thyroid disorders.\u00a0\u00a0Appropriate lab tests should be considered to rule this out.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "I am having pain just before I urinate and during urinationand it stops after urination completion.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is NOTa burning pain.\u00a0\u00a0It is located just above the penis area.It is a moderate pain but uncomfortable. I have beenincontinent for 40 years. When it started, an urologistdiagnosed it as neuropathy and said the bladder underwentlots of spasms while he observed.\u00a0\u00a0He offered to cut something, but I declined.\u00a0\u00a0Pain went away but incontinencehas stayed with me.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am getting the pain again.I am guessing it is in my bladder (but I do not know).I am also having a lot of flatulence (unsual for me), andwonder if the two could be related.\u00a0\u00a0I told my familydoctor about the discomfort some time ago.\u00a0\u00a0He said hewould do nothing at that time.\u00a0\u00a0Gradually the pain/discomfort occuring before and during urination went away.Now it is back and has stayed for over a month, varyingin the level of discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0Anti gas herbs do not\u00a0\u00a0help.I am tempted to call an urologist and get his opinion.Has anyone else had a symptom like mine?\u00a0\u00a0Do\u00a0\u00a0a lot ofmen in their 70's have this kind of problem?\u00a0\u00a0Are there herbsthat do work?I respectfully await your answer.",
