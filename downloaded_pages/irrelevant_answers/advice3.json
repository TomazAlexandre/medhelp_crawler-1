            "answer": "From your description, it is not absolutely clear that your symptoms are related to your heart. Sometimes an MI can result in a reduction in your heart function that can lead to heart failure. Some of the symptoms of heart failure are swelling in your legs, shortness of breath, abdominal fullness and bloating. The scan you describe only mentions a mild reduction in the systolic function of your heart. It would be inportant to see your doctor soon in order to make sure that your are not having heart failure symptoms of congestion and fluid overload. You doctor will also be able to investigate other possible causes of your symptoms",
