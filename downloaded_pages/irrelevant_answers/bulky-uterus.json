            "answer": "Hi!If you were to read a medical text on the subject, it would probably advise an endometrial biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0This would certainly be the safest approach.\u00a0\u00a0If you had no risk factors for endometrial cancer ( esp. obesity/diabetes/family history, etc), and if you prefered, I might consider treating with Provera or Prometrium for 14 days and then repeating the ultrasound scan.\u00a0\u00a0I am also assuming here that you have not ever had 12 months in a row with no menstrual period ( that is the definition of menopause, and post-menopausal bleeding always warrants a biopsy!).There are a couple of methods to control peri-menopausal irregular bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0If you are a non-smoker, oral contraceptives can be used.\u00a0\u00a0Hormone replacement therapy can be used also.\u00a0\u00a0Some women prefer to take progesterone every 1-3 months as needed. The Mirena IUD is very nice in some cases like this.\u00a0\u00a0OR an endometrial ablation can be a dream come true!I would also recommend (if you were my patient) a follow up ultrasound in 6 months to re-evaluate the uterine size.\u00a0\u00a0It is a bit above normal, but nothing to get alarmed about if it is stable.Hope this helps!Dr B",
