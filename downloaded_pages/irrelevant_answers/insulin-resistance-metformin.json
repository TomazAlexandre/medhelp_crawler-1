            "answer": "The test is called a glucose fasting test, and yes, you can ABSOLUTELY have insulin resistance and NOT have diabetes or PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0My friend lives near Philadelphia and has some of the best doctors in the country (I wish I had her doctors!) and that is her situation so I believe them.\u00a0\u00a0Now if it were the doctors I've been dealing with around here, I wouldn't necessarily buy it! ;o)As far as the metformin - are you overweight?\u00a0\u00a0I think partly the metformin can help with the weight loss, and with insulin resistance it can be controlled by changing your diet, as well as losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0I'm no doctor, but I do think it's possible to ultimately go off the metformin once you achieve a healthy weight and learn how to eat properly to help the prevent the problem.Now that I think of it, my friend is not on metformin.\u00a0\u00a0She just sees a nutritionist and is on a strict diet, and exercises A LOT.\u00a0\u00a0She was by no means overweight when she was diagnosed, but she said she has also lost weight.",

Is there a test that can be done to determine whether or not you are insulin resistant?\u00a0\u00a0Can you have insulin resistance alone, and not have PCOS or diabetes or anything else?What does Metformin do (is it to combat insulin resistance)?\u00a0\u00a0Once on Metformin, can you eventually stop taking it once your hormones and weight and everything are under control, or will your body go back to being out of whack?I didn't really get the opporunity to ask my Dr. these questions because she simply telephoned with my blood test results and prescribed the Met.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have a follow-up visit with her until the end of June.",
