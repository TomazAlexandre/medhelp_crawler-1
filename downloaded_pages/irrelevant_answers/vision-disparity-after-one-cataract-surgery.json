    "question": "I was detected to have PSCC in both eyes in the year 2002 when I was merely 32 years old, the doc said it was a dot cataract. From the year 2008, I began to see halos around the light, a vague cloudiness during the night, poor depth perception during the night, being troubled by the glare of incoming headlights and a fall of visual acuity. I had been myopic all my life, with -8.5 power distance and about -7 power reading vision with correctional glasses. I had got my right eye operated on January 13, 2012. The doc said my distance vision in the right operated eye was 0 and reading vision will require a +2 correction. Since I want to be sure about the visual outcome in the operated eye, I asked the doctor to bring parity in two eyes and he prescribed me to wear a -7.5 contact lens in the left unoperated eye (its visual acuity with glasses was 20/40). Should I get the left eye operated sooner rather than later? I have somehow a feeling that I chose to get my right eye operated sooner, and going by the progress of the cataract could wait for at least another five years. Now with contact lens in one eye and with one operated eye the visual outcome is not satisfactory. I am just 42 with demanding visual needs. I need a sharp and pure reading vision. An aspheric toric monofocal lens has been put in my right eye. I don't have diabetes, no other eye condition apart from the fact that my myopia was quasi-degenerative in nature, never had steroids as medicne. I am a smoker and used to long hours of reading and computer exposure. Please suggest, should I get my left eye operated any soon? With two eyes operated just at the age of 42, would there be any lifelong restriction/inhibition put on me, as I am intensely active as a biker, teacher, reviewer and as a traveller requiring to carry luggage?",
