    "question": "Male 45 UK (100 kilo) currently dieting. Family history of Diabetes.Currently no DX, awaiting MRI appointment. My MS??? type symptoms for your thought.I would be grateful for your thoughts on my symptoms and if in your opinions they suggest MS.I am overweight and have been since giving up smoking 5 years ago but i am now on a strict diet and exercise program. I mention this as i am not sure if it has a connection and i am aware that being overweight can cause numbness in the legs. However these symptoms did start well before the weight gain and are not confined to my legs. I also have suspicions that my weight could be caused by my metabolic rate, see thyroid post from me.Approx. 12 years ago i developed a small patch just above my right knee that went sort of numb. Both legs are now equally affected and are permanently like this.\u00a0\u00a0This small patch has developed into a larger patch and now stretches from my knee upwards about 10\"\u00a0\u00a0on front and outer sides of legs. I would describe it more as a loss of sensation. I also get occasional tingling, burning and a feeling of rippling. I have no problem walking but i do have muscle aches in the legs or cramps as though i have run a marathon, these are worse after sitting for a time. The burning and rippling can occur at any time, resting or otherwise. The other problem i have is with my hands/arms. I am an artist and am constantly using my hands and have muscle aches in these areas. Depending on the size of the item i am holding i get pains in my fingers if the item is small or wrists and forearms if bigger. These pains happen approx. 75% of the time. Things like carving a joint of meat are painful or repetitive tasks. As an example last week i needed to tear a small strip off about 20 greetings cards to create a jagged edge and this was causing pain to my fingers.Other things which come and go are headaches, ringing in ear with loud music, and what i can only describe as awkward hand writing as though it is not a natural thing to do. Also the occasional loss of concentration, but maybe thats just me. I stupid thing i find lately is typing errors on such basic words and having to think occasionally how to spell some words.My google search indicated Diabetes or MS. I have recently tested negative for Diabetes. I was hoping these issues were down to weight gain or trapped nerves but with problems in both arms and legs i guess that is unlikely.Thanks\u00a0\u00a0in advance for any comment, any advice appreciated",
