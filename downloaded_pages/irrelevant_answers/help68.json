            "answer": "I always get dizzy & feel super weak during my pregnancies. I'm feeling like that today actually :( i pass out a lot too. It's not a stomach bug girl. Your midwife is completely wrong. It's your blood sugar level. Even if you passed your glucose test & don't have diabetes your blood level fluctuates very quickly during pregnancy so you have to eat. After I eat I always feel better. Drink some fruit juice because it has sugar & is more healthy than sodas or koolaid. & eat something like a salad with boiled eggs chopped in it if you find it hard to eat anything. I know when I get like that I lose my appetite & only eat in small portions.",
