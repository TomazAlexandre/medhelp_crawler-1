They are an amazing group of supportive people with the same problem, and they have learned through strict diet low-carb high-fat, not only can they control her diabetes that they can really lower their numbers and get their A-1 C back where it belongs.

    "question": "Recently I was in the hospital for sepsis and cellulitis and we found as expected that my Type 2 was not under control. Three new meds for me later (hadn't been on meds in years) my fasting sugars were 70-100 and before meals were 85-100 and before bed was a bit higher at 120-170. The couple nights on higher end I got a VERY SMALL dose of insulin but it was only a couple times. Came home and so far in the first three days lowest sugar has been 112 but getting up to 146 before meals. I don't understand when I am eating the exact same things I had in the hospital. Literally I am buying almost the exact same stuff. I was getting bags of antibiotics but no extra fluid help. Any suggestions. I am trying to get established with a doctor. When I am eating here at home was told to stick to 4 carb units per meal but rarely have I gon over two or three.",
