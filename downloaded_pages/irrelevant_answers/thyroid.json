            "answer": "Tough question but here is what I would do, beings he's willing to keep very close tabs on you (that's a good thing!), I would stick with him for now. After you have labs drawn here soon, will you personally be visiting him?If so, I would ask him at what point would he consider it worth treating (A TSH of what)? A guess here, but I'm thinking he's waiting for you to just fall outside the range hence wanting to test you so frequently.",

He's not looking at the TSH to treat though, he's looking at the T4.He put me on a week of steroids last month to try and reduce the antibodies. After the treatment, I felt great and the labs came back in the right range.\u00a0\u00a0Up til then the TSH was borderline high but the t3 and t4 were normal.\u00a0\u00a0Then 2 weeks ago, i crashed. Now I have even less energy.",

            "answer": "My understanding of the Ts is little. Most of what I see posted, is Free Ts. From the sounds of it, you don't have a bad doctor.He does think you have a problem but at this point, he's not comfortable to give you medication. Is my guess and guess as well, that he thinks you will be moving into the zone he'd be comfortable with treating. I would hang tough and stick with him for a-while.",

            "answer": "i think he is a great dr and at the appt today, he was placing more stress on the symptoms than the test results.What i don't understand is that all of these other post have high antibodies and they are automatically placed on Thyroid meds. I am just trying to make sense of it all.",

            "answer": "Most stories I hear, is that a doctor will not treat unless your TSH is out of range, no matter you have antibodies or not. Some doctors do. Take for example Dr. Mark Lupo in the thyroid forum. With elevated antibodies and TSH of 3.0 (I think I recall he mentioning a TSH of 2.5 +) that he considers treatment worthwhile. That said, I think he is the exception, not the rule.I think you have a good doctor and would be reluctant to search for another at this point. Unfortunately, I think when it comes to this condition-there are more lousy doctors than there are good.",

            "answer": "For what it's worth, I do think you need treatment. My hope is, that your doctor will initiate it soon. My feeling is, he very well might.Your first experience is very common, unfortunately. It was also mine.As for antibodies, yours are high. It is apparent that your antibodies are attacking your thyroid. No question. I'd wager that the 184 was your TgAb and 1000 was your TPO.That said, treatement for hypothyroid or hashimoto's hypothyroid is the same. The only thing I have heard reported to reduce TPO (it is thought) is Selenium. However, there is current discussion about Selenium thought to be tied into diabetes.",

            "answer": "As i said earlier, pending the results from today's test, at the very least he is going to consult a specialist to see if I need to be seen by someone other than him. He is very concerned about the symptoms, and the anitbodies suggests that i will be fully hypo soon if i am not now.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, there is no discernable inflammation, either to the touch, or with an ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0everything is on the border now, and that is what is frustrating.That being said, diabetes runns in my family, and I would rather avoid that.",
