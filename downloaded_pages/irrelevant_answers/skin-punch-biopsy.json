            "answer": "Well, depends on if you're talking about a lumbar puncture, or a needle biopsy of another part of your body.\u00a0\u00a0Please elaborate on which one they're going to do, and where, so you can get proper feedback from us.\u00a0\u00a0But I can tell you that if they're doing a needle biopsy of, say, your thigh, it won't hurt any more than a regular shot.\u00a0\u00a0Just focus on how the results are going to lead to proper treatment and thus relief from the problems you have now.\u00a0\u00a0And you can always ask for a tranquilizer just before the procedure, if they'll allow it, to keep you calm about the whole situation.",

            "answer": "I had a skin punch done for autonomic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Didn't hurt at all when it was done.\u00a0\u00a0The three spots were a little sore the next day, and then about a week later they were itchy as the scabs started to come off.\u00a0\u00a0Eash spot was maybe a quarter inch circle.\u00a0\u00a0The only surprise for me was that I couldn't get the spots wet for 24 hours, so don't let the day before be the day you decide not to bother with a shower :)",

    "question": "Has anybody had a skin punch skin biopsy done? I have to have one done next month, what is it like?Does it hurt? The doctor said it won't hurt becuase of the local anesthesia but I'd like to hear from somone who has actually had it done. Thankyou. They are doing this to take a look at my nerves to try to figure out whether my autonomic neuropathy is genetic or from something else. They already know it not from diabetes so they are trying to find another cause.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 22yr old female.",
