            "answer": "Legalities do take time but are well worth it if you win...where I live the prison system learned the hard way by leaving addicts to themselves and a few dead bodies later became convinced to try another approach. Methadone is now given in small but effective doses to the addict using a tapering method while monitoring for additional health concerns. The court here does not consider it frivolous to listen to anyone with a legitimate request. And to anwser your question, they should dispense legitmate prescriptions to anyone who needs them, but again, I would call ahead to the specific jail to make sure.",

All~I know the jail gives little to no meds for detox but do you think the methadone clinics try to brain wash people into a 6 mos - 1 yr taper before quiting even if that person was on methadone for only 3 to 9 mos and wants to get off. For an addict to hear they will need a yr long taper is music to some ears and easy to convince people to stay on that long. But i read alot of people get off after 3 mos -12mos without a long detox at all or none at all and they are fine physical but go through the same mental ****. Is there some here who quit early or c/t off methadone without alot of problems?",

Does the jail allow you your methadone or other meds, ie. heart meds etc. I had a friend who got into his 2nd DUI and wrecked his truck and bumped his head and the ER gave him 12 of the\u00a0\u00a05-500 lortabs and i went and filled them and brought them to jail and he was given 1 every 4 hrs as prescribed. Just wondered how others made out mostly with Methadone",
