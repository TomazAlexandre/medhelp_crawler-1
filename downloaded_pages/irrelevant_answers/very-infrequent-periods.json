            "answer": "Sounds like you could have polycystic ovarian sydrome (PCOS).\u00a0\u00a0Especially as you are getting pimples and growing more hair (hyperandrogenism).\u00a0\u00a0Have you also had an increase in weight?\u00a0\u00a0Not ovulating and an absence of periods is also a sign of PCOS.This is something that needs to be treated.\u00a0\u00a0You are at increased risk of insulin resistance and type II diabetes as well as other metabolic disorders.Your treatment will depend on what your symptoms are.\u00a0\u00a0Whether it's just that you aren't ovulating or there are more.\u00a0\u00a0It will probably be hormonal treatment, whether that be the pill or something else.It's something to discuss with your doctor and if your doctor doesn't want to talk to you about this, get a second opinion.",

    "question": "Hi there, I will get right to the point and give you my symptoms:I will have a period and then miss 3-5 months before having another, I do not get any PMS symptoms.I seem to be getting a lot of pimples and my facial hair is becoming an issue (never has before).My libido is way down and my boobs are out growing my bra, the rest of my body has stayed the same.I spoke to my doctor and he offhandedly told me to get on birth control, how will this fix my problem?I had a child 3 years ago and that is when this all began, my question is what is the cause of all this and is there a solution which does not put me on birth control (I do not plan on getting pregnant but am weary about what the pill does to you). Also am I causing harm to my body by not having regular cycles?Thanks in advanceLacy",
