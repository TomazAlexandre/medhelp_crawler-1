    "question": "I constantly suffer from a very uncomfortable, not always painful, bladder infection. If I need to go, I need to go now. It feels as though the muscles are cramping when I do go too. I went to my GP and he did a dipstick test which showed a very bad infection, which he said was in the kidneys and the bladder. I've been suffering for w few years and I've taken broad spectrum antibiotics, but it didn't fully clear the infection. I drink plenty of water and Citro Soda, but nothing has seemed to help. I have also heard of Pelvic Floor Syndrome, which was a suggested ailment, but then the test shouldn't have shwowed and infection.Any suggestions on treatment and what it might be?",
