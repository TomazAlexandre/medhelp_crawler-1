            "answer": "I'm not sure where the jittery feeling is coming from, although I've felt that when I've been anxious. But I also get the heart palpitations. They're called PVC's or Preventricle Contractions, which is a skipped beat or an extra beat. They're fairly common and lot's of people get them and can live with them just fine. You do want to watch how many you're getting a day. Have you done a stress test on the treadmill or a nuclear stress test? This would show if you're having PVC's. Ask if you an wear the holter (heart moniter) for 24 hours. This would measure how many PVC's you're having a day. You can just put it on and go about your business. Then the doctor can tell if you are getting too many or not. Another thing they look for is if you have two skipped beats or more at a time. That's when it gets more concerning.I'm not sure about the other symptoms. You're too young for menopause, I would think. Have you had your thyroid tested? That would be my next step if I were you.I wish you well. I hope you find out soon what's going on so you can feel better. Take care.April",
