            "answer": "I think you are 100% on the money bapper, when you say you want to \"learn how to be a diabetic.\" If you feel your doctor isn't giving you the support you need to learn how to manage your diabetes, then you are right and you need to seek a different doctor, nurse practitioner or diabetic educator. You need someone to help you find the diet and exercise regime that works for you; we are all different, some people prefer to follow a set diet with mealplans and menus, Others (like me) prefer general guidelines that I can follow and find what works best for me. I find it surprising your doctor would put you on medication and not ask you to test your blood sugars and then follow up to see how you are doing. Do you have insurance? You might want to check and see if it covers the cost of test strips and lancets. Also you don't really need to use a new lancet each time you test, you can re-use them as long as they do the job. I buy very few lancets.In addition to finding a practitioner who will give you more guidance, I suggest you do some learning on your own. Read those pamphlets you were given. Read the info on here or other reputable websites. Get an up to date book from the library if you have to.It does sound like you have some other issues besides the diabetes but most of us do and you want to have a healthcare professional who will help you see the big picture. Being tired all the time is no fun. You don't say how your glucose is now but if it isn't under control that could be part of the problem.",
