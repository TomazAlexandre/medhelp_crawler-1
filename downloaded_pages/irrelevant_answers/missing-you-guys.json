    "question": "Missing you guys! Just referred someone over here and got me thinking I should drop by and say hello. I'm almost 16 weeks pregnant now (almost halfway there--- almost!). I am weighing in at 187 lbs so I've gained 10 lbs so far. Not the most fun part but I'm trying to not focus on the weight issues; focusing on baking a healthy bun. Obviously I don't want to gain too much, too fast, because then I put myself at risk for gestational diabetes and pre eclampsia and all those ugly things.So just missing you all! I hope everyone is doing well and is losing/maintaining weight!",
