            "answer": "Hi RSLendon,First I would like to tell you that I am not a medical professional, so my input/advice is solely based on personal experience and knowledge and is not in place of advice from a physician.My son, now 9-1/2 was dagnosed with type 1 diabetes at the age of 3.\u00a0\u00a0My sister was diagnosed 8 yrs. ago at the age of 24.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed before my son, so we had some info. on symptoms and knew something was wrong right away.When someone is diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, there blood sugar would be higher than the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0High blood sugar symptoms include:- hunger (increased appetite)- extreme thirst- frequent urination (as well as large amounts)- fatigue / drowsiness- blurred visionMy son was asking for drinks at a rate where I could barely keep up. He was a 3 yr. old that was telling me, fill my cup up, up, all the way up, and then he would guzzle it down and beg for more.\u00a0\u00a0Also, he was urinating so much that I could not potty train him.There are people who do NOT have diabetes, but have Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)\u00a0\u00a0Here in quotes is some info. I found while searching the key phrase: extreme sugar cravings (It is lengthy , but might be helpful to you and your son)\"hypoglycemia is low blood sugar, and it is increasingly prevalent in our society. Hypoglycemia can cause an array of symptoms, including spaciness, fatigue, mood changes, PMS, sugar craving, headaches, difficulty focusing the eyes, tremors, temperamental outbursts, depression, excessive sweating, hot flashes, palpitations, cold extremities, abdominal pain, and panic attacks.If you have any of these symptoms, the next time you go to a doctor, try asking him or her if the symptoms you experience could be due to hypoglycemia. You may provoke a bemused or annoyed look, or perhaps your doctor will, in fact, suggest a glucose tolerance test. Don't bother. Glucose tolerance tests, as performed conventionally, are not designed to detect hypoglycemia until or unless it has reached a very extreme level.The truth is that hypoglycemia is far more prevalent than we're led to believe. Studies show that even in its full-blown form it is often misdiagnosed. Consider this example: In one study, of thirty-nine patients who had tumors in the pancreas, a condition causing profound hypoglycemia, eight were first diagnosed with epilepsy or neurosis! Detection and diagnosis of hypoglycemia can lead to treatment that can totally correct this condition. Even if the symptoms are vague and seemingly subjective (which makes most doctors want to shy away from this diagnosis), if you're the one experiencing them, they can destroy the quality of your life.\"You will notice that sugar cravings is a symptom that is listed.My son had symptoms of high blood sugar for approx. 2 wks and when I realized something was not right, I took him to his pediatrician and said I wanted him tested for diabetes and explained the extreme thirst, etc. and he said that some young kids ask for a lot to drink for attention.\u00a0\u00a0I said, I know my son and this is not for attention.\u00a0\u00a0Well, they did test him by taking a urine sample and keytones were present and he was then admitted to the hospital for a 3 day stay.\u00a0\u00a0When admitted his blood sugar was 545.I would make another appt. for your son and bring up hypoglycemia and honestly, if you are not happy with your son's physician, get a 2nd opinion.I agree with your concern that something is going on since he has these Intense sugar cravings.\u00a0\u00a0I do believe that if it was diabetes causing this, he would have other symptoms such as the ones I listed in regards to High Blood Sugar and I have not yet read anywhere that sugar cravings fall in the high blood sugar category.\u00a0\u00a0I would lean towards hypoglycemia, but as I mentioned, I am not a medical professional, so there could be something else triggering these cravings.\u00a0\u00a0You definitely need to talk again with your physician.\u00a0\u00a0(2nd opinions are good!)Please keep us posted and make an appt. with a physician soon!You will have other volunteers that are VERY knowledgeable comment in regards to your question and I know they will have helpful input to add.Take care and post again when you have more info.",

            "answer": "Well, I'm no doctor, but if he's craving sugar he's not diabetic. He would be losing more weight that 2 pounds, and he would urinate frequently and be extremely thirsty.But I'm 99.9% positive that its not diabetes. (I'm a diabetic by the way)But just so you understand, Diabetes doesn't work like that. When you are diabetic, your pancreas produces no insulin. No insulin means higher blood sugar levels. You would crave sugar if your blood sugar was low.",

    "question": "My 12 year old son recently lost 5 pounds and was tired and complained of headaches and fatigue. His pediatrician tested his urine which was fine and he said diabetes would show in the urine test.Over the last two months, he has gained back three pounds and has less headaches and fatigue but now has intense sugar cravings. It was so bad that his teacher called me from school because she found out he was pouring sugar into his water bottles and bringing them to school to drink during the day. He literally CRAVES soda, which I don't allow him to drink much of. We also caught him putting sugar into the icecube tray and adding it to his water. Is this just him acting like a kid or should I be concerned of an underlying problem such as diabetes?",
