            "answer": "Are you sure it couldn't be PID? It causes chronic pelvic pain. What other symptoms do you have? These are just some of the symptoms of PCOS, anxiety, baldness or thinning hair, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, depression, type 2 diabetes, genetics, heart problems, increased hair growth (hirsuitism), infertility, menstruation (periods), obesity, ovarian cysts, pelvic pain, pregnancy, skin problems, sleep disorders, and weight gain.What tests were you given to prove that you have PCOS? ANy cysts on the ovaries? Are your hormones out of balance?I don't think I ever gotten actual pain from my PCOS. I use to get a ton of menstrul cramps in my ovaries and uterus area, but I think thats different from what you have. PCOS is different in every woman, so just because I don't have your symptoms doesn't mean I don't have PCOS.",

            "answer": "First, when i was first diagnosed one of the questions my doctor asked about was if I had pelvic pain. It is a symptom of PCOS. You need to find an endocrinologiost or an OBGYN who knows more about this than your currents doctors. Don't give up. I have had it since 2003 (atleast that is when I was diagnosed) and am still doing research. You are your biggest advocate.",

    "question": "I need some help, I have pelvic pain a lot and the doctors say that's not a symptom, PCOS doesn't cause pain. AM I crazy? Does anyone have pain from this? Also, I'm taking Metformin, is anyone on that and if so has anyone gotten pregnant? How long were you on it? I've been pregnant twice and lost both of them within 6 weeks. I've tried for 4 years to have a baby, and 5 years before and only got pregnant twice and losing both. What can I do to get pregnant? What can I ask my doctor about? I'm so unsure about this and could really use some help, please!",
