            "answer": "Hi ready2Bdone. Nice to see you post ! :) You have done a very good job with your taper Congrats !! I do not think I will be breaking the rules to say it would be good to start putting more time between dosages.. get some Imodium on board and make sure you are drinking a lot of fluids a sports drink would be good Help to replace electrolytes. sorry to read of your diabetes being clean thou will give you a better opportunity to deal with it. my bp went down a lil when I got clean and my life became so much more enjoyable.. Keep yourself occupied and make a quit date on your calender.. Keep a positive attitude and a I can do spirit. You and your children deserve so much more the the haze of addiction.. lesa",

            "answer": "Hell of a way to loose weight !! You sound like you have a positive attitude about the whole thing. this is good :) They have sports drinks that have less sugar look for these but definitely push the water.. no soda :( I love Dr. Pepper so I know how difficult that can be. I started a garden last year and have one this year. I have liver and kidney disease so it became important to me to eat healthier my garden also occupies time and this is always a good thing ! You have done good on bringing down your diabetic reading !! Keep up the good work :) try to keep the time between dosing the same Like if you go 6 hours wait another six until you no longer feel wd then make it longer.. repeat till you are down to 1 then go for it !! The lack of sleep will effect you most I suspect as it is essential but it does not last forever.. Thank you for the Congrats ! :) I can not wait till you are on this side either :))",

    "question": "trying to get all the support i can. i have been using off and on for several years due to a dew surgeries. at first it started out here and there. i could do with or without them though i loved taking them. few years down the road i wasnt even taking that many and\u00a0\u00a0one night didnt have any at all and woke up tossing and turning along with diarrhea. took me awhile to figure out what was wrong but once i did i popped a lorcet and all was better. happened again a bit later. had no idea how addicting these things were. i started out with vicodin 5mg and at my worst lorcet 10mg 15-20 a day. enough was enough. i was always chasing that high and very rarely achieving it. over the last few months i have started tapering down in attempt to quit. did the taper method since having a few mild wd and then finding these boards and realizing they get much worse. scared me to death. i have several other health problems. depression, high blood pressure and recently dx diabetes. i have 2 eleven year olds and they need their mom. the past 2 weeks i have taken 4 10mg a day. and yesterday i went to 3 mg. 1 in the morning 1/2 a pill 4 hours later then another 1/2 4 hours after that 1 more pill before bed. the thing is i was always taking them every 4 hours. so anytime i try to go more than 4 hours my stomach starts making these horrible noises, blurred vision and then the diarrhea starts. 2 months ago i did this (was taking 8 pills a day) and was up to taking them every every 7 hours instead of 4. i had so much watery diarrhea ( to the point i couldnt even hold it) i ended up in the er severely dehydrated very low potassium. diarrhea vomiting and my 19 year old had to help me walk in the er. so needless to say i am scared to death! btw the er visit was when i found out i was a diabetic so at least something good came out of it i guess. anywho sorry to be so long winded. im just trying to do this as carefully as possible. in between drs so i cant go to them for help. i plan on staying at 3 a day for a few days and instead of every 4 hours try to go to every 5 hours. any help at all would be greatly appreciated because now that im down so low im not sure how to go to the next step.",
