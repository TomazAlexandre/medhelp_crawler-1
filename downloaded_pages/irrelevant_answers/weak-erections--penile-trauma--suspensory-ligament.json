            "answer": "It is difficult to give suggestions over the internet without examination.It is possible that an anatomic abnormality can be leading to the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The urologist who performed your surgery would have a better idea.Repeating imaging with an ultrasound, or an MRI can give more information as to the cause, with Peyronies being possible.Metabolic causes like thyroid disease can lead to some of the symptoms, and should be tested for.As for psychological causes, you can attribute the cause to this if the tests remain negative.I would obtain another opinion, preferably at a major academic medical center.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "Hi,I am 26 y.o. bisexual. I have a problem regarding masturbation and anal ******* and i dont know if its a form of erectile dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime i masturbate or ****, the first few minutes of masturbating/******* seems very well, i get normal erections and i can be as hard as i can get.\u00a0\u00a0But everytime i am nearing to come, i get so excited and i put pressure much on my hands and feet as they become so stiff, but i am surprised why my penis just becomes partially erect and therefore i can no longer fulfill my ******* since it becomes soft. And to the case of masturbating, i find it unfulfilling having to ejaculate with a soft penis when at the course of my masturbation, i had perfectly normal erection. Please help!",

    "question": "My ex-girlfriend & I never had sex but what we did do was press/rub my penis against her vagina/pelvic bone for stimulation.I broke up with her a few weeks before my problem started.I hadn't masturbated in days so I had a very strong erection. I was masturbating & when I ejaculated I pressed the penis downwards to get the semen into the toilet bowl. Before I lost the erection I did same all over again. Since then I've had the following symptoms:- very weak erections- only get an erection when I touch it- loose at base- penis curved to the left, didn't before the traumaI use cialis to have sex with new girlfriend but erections are still not very strong.Urologist sent me for tests:- Doppler Ultrasound, ruled out peyronies & venous leak- Blood test, no diabetesI found an article that detailed a similar case to my own:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/urology/messages/31847.htmlDamage to the Penile Suspensory Ligament is caused by forced downward pressure & the symptoms are the same as my own. Dr Ralph in London can repair this.I flew to London for a consultation & he was willing to correct this.When Dr Ralph examined me in the operating theatre he realised that the PSL was not damaged. He straightened my penis using the Nesbit plication technique & told me not to masturbate for 6 wks.",
