            "answer": "Thanks for responding luxejess93! My situation is very similar to yours. But when I went into the dr at 32 weeks he told me not to lose anymore weight and unfortunately I am. I have lost five pounds since my 4pound gain at 28 weeks. I am 33+3 and at 28weeks I found out I was borderline gestational diabetic. So I have been watching what I eat. I have been eating healthy already but now I have completely cut out all the little sugar I had allowed my self. I do have a strong family line of diabetes, so I know it is something you don't play around with! I think it is exciting that we are both almost done!!!",

    "question": "Have any of you lost weight during your last trimester? If so was baby okay? I have been losing about a pound a week for the past three weeks. I am not meaning to, it is just happening. This is my third pregnancy and I have not had this issue before with the others.",
