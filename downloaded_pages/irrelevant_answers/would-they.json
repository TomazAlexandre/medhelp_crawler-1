            "answer": "Perhaps you were iron deficient did they tell you ?\u00a0\u00a0So you are saying they denied letting you donate blood? THey wouldn't tell you why they wouldn't let you donate? Or are they testing another sample for something? I wasn't quite clear in what you said. They may just be repeating something and not know the results yet. It may not mean you have something....thanks,mkh9",

            "answer": "Hi I also wanted to mention have you ever been rejected before? It is possible that they saw that you had a health problem or medicine that they don't allow. I googled red cross donation rules and clicked on conditions and it has a lot of conditions you can't have such as diabetes, infection, high white blood cell count, TB,\u00a0\u00a0cold , flu, travel to some places. it might be easier for you to look at their website. I wouldn't worry at this point as they have so many criteria that it doesn't mean you have the scary stuff like hepatitis, HIV , west nile virus etc.\u00a0\u00a0Take a look and let me know what you think.mkh9",
