            "answer": "Hi Linda, I'm not an expert by any means but with CKD it's usually the opposite, cats become really anorexic, it becomes a real challenge to get keep them eating. I wonder if the dietary change the Vet made was to drastic in protein restrictions? If a cat isn't getting enough protein they become ravenous...I've seen this first hand when one of mine was on a certain food that was supposed to be of high quality....even his coat color changed. Spent a lot of money on tests that all came back normal, so Vet suggested a new brand of food....he changed back to himself overnight almostI know with CKD Vets suggest a lower protein diet, perhaps the one your feeding is just too low?Talk to your Vet first but I would really try adding a small amount of another diet to the one he's on...one that list meat as the FIRST ingredientGood luck dear boy we wish you all the best xoxo",

    "question": "Our 15 year old cat was diagnosed with kidney failure a while back, and other than a change of food the vet didn't seem to think there was anything else that could be done.\u00a0\u00a0He now is so very hungry ALL the time, non stop, and I was wondering if that is just another symptom, or if he probably has another health issue on top of the kidney disease",
