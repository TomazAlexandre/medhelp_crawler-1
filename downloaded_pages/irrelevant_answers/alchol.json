            "answer": "Namaste,I agree with everything cattalina had to say, but I'll give you some additional information which may make you reconsider your use of alcohol.Alcohol can affect your body in the following ways:Alcohol increases the acid in your stomach. The irritating effects of alcohol may cause gastritis (inflammation of the lining of the stomach), pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas), or a peptic ulcer (a raw area in the lining of the stomach or intestines).Alcohol can also damage your small intestine and keep it from absorbing nutrients.Alcohol can keep you from getting deep sleep, which may mean a less restful night's sleep. Also, drinking alcohol can make insomnia worse. Although it may help you go to sleep, when the drink wears off you may wake up earlier. You may also wake up more often to urinate.Alcohol can cause gout because it can keep your body from getting rid of uric acid. Gout is a buildup of uric acid that causes inflammation in your joints.Drinking too much alcohol puts you at higher risk for cancer of the pancreas, mouth, tongue, and throat. This risk is even greater if you also use tobacco products.Alcohol may cause liver cancer, fatty liver, hepatitis, cirrhosis, and other liver disease.Drinking too much alcohol makes you lose protein, minerals, and vitamins. Alcohol affects thiamine (vitamin B-1) in particular. Your nerves, muscles, heart, and brain need thiamine to work normally. Lack of thiamine can cause problems with short-term memory, eye movement, walking, cramps, numbness, tingling, and weakness in your legs and hands.Drinking too much alcohol also may be part of what causes high blood pressure and strokes. Alcohol can lead to heart muscle disease or heart failure.Alcohol can also cause:increased blood sugar levels, which makes diabetes worseinteractions with medicinesworsening of most other medical problems (heart disease, kidney disease, circulation problems)injuries from falls and other accidents.Enough said. By the way, I'm an alcoholic with over 6 years sobriety, so I know a little about what I'm saying.Michael(Jikan)Michael(Jikan)",
