            "answer": "I'm familiar with type 1 diabetes. My brother was diagnosed as a baby & my son was diagnosed at age 7. I would think that with both type 1 & type 2 that you have to watch your carbs & not just your sugars. A lot of fruits & vegetables have carbs. It's easy to get a nutrition book at a book store, to keep on hand, that tells what foods have the amounts of carbs it them; some even show restaurant info. They are handy! Your children might be at greater risk to get diabetes since you have it, but not a for sure thing. I have two sons, one has it & one doesn't. I don't have it & neither do my other siblings.",
