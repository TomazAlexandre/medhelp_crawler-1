    "question": "I have been suffering from recurrent abscesses on my face since April 2009.I have had no less than 4 HIV antibody lab tests till yesterday.All of these tests have yielded nothing.I have also had a urine test for diabetes which has yielded nothing.My risk factor was from when I visited a prostitute in a dingy joburg flat (Saturday night).I only had condom protected oral sex performed on me.However I dozed of in her bed and when I awoke the condom had been removed.Now I was quite worried by this because on Thursday morning I suffered painful urine discharge.I also had a full std panel -which came back negative.I am constantly being harassed at work for this recurrence of septic sores and am now worried I may have a immune deficiency or special problem that causes HIV to remain undetectable.",
