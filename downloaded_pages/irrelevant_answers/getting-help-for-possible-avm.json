    "question": "Hello,I have had a problem with a specific type of chronic pain and parathesia for over a decade. We thought for a while that I had MS, but 4 neurologists said it is not MS, although I cannot have an MRI due to severe claustrophobia. Recently I have developed some severe and frightening symptoms. I have had 3 attacks of SEVERE PAIN in my right arm and the third was my lower back, hip and right leg. The pain and numbness lasts for several months and then dissipates gradually until it is gone. This time with my leg the numbness is still present in my right leg from my foot to my knee.I was watching Mystery Diagnosis and the lady from New Mexico that founded angiomaalliance.org had very similar symptoms to what I am experiencing.I belong to Kaiser and I feel that I have a hard time finding someone to take me seriously. Every time I have gone to see a neurologist they act like I'm nuts, or that I'm just trying to \"get attention\". This is most frustrating as it could not be further from the truth. I am now a 52 year old grandmother, and I don't need that kind of attetion, but I do need to find out what is wrong before it kills me. Can you give me some advice? Oh and I am also a type 2 diabetic, that cannot take insulin as I had a life threatening reaction to it. I really don't want this thing to happen again, I'm terrified of it now. Thank You",
