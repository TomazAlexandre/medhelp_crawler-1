            "answer": "Hi!An angiography will be more diagnostic than than a MRI for a blood vessel clot. Also clots can be mobile\u2014ie they may move from one place to another. This mobile clot is very dangerous as it can lodge in lung, brain, and heart.Yes, so all this can be connected. You need to get examined for precursors of clots like diabetes, dyslipidemia, thyroid disorders, high blood pressure, hyperviscosity syndromes where the blood is thick (eg: leukemias, polycythemia, and the myeloproliferative disorders) etc.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your cardiologist for primary examination followed by proper tests and treatment. Take care!",
