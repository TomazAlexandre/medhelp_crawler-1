            "answer": "It is difficult to say without evaluation.If prophyria is suspected, the testing is done via a 24-hr urine sample.Urinary ALA, PBG, and porphyrin concentrations are normally obtained.If the disease continues to be suspected, further testing can be done with an erythrocyte enzyme assay.If the symptoms continue, you can consider a referral to a hematologist to discuss these tests.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.www.kevinmd.com",

            "answer": "Thanks.\u00a0\u00a0My primary care physician is unconcerned and feels the condition is too rare for me to have, yet doesn't know why I am having the current problem. She says there are too many wierd syndromes and rare diseases for any doctor to keep up with. My hepatologist also says I can't possibly have it because it is rare. I plan to see if Mayo may take in me in the liver transplant dept for at least a review and better dx, given all the complications and my continuing poor health and unexplained symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to know is porphyria is something dangerous, something that it is of benefit for my doctors to know if I have and whether it would make a difference in my treatment?",
