            "answer": "There are a ton of reasons that he could be sleeping too much: it could be anything from depression to a hypothyroid disorder/endocrine inbalance, to rarer conditions. First thing I would do is ask him if he has any ideas why he sleeps so much and ask him if he's been upset about anything lately or hasn't felt like getting out of bed, if everything makes him bored, etc. the regular depression screening questions. If he's deemed a happy sleepy kid then he does need to go to the doc to get a battery of blood tests that they give anyone who has a symptom that could be many things: There's 5 or 6 different panels and up to 10 or 15 things that some of the panels test for. It seems like a lot but it's simple. If there are no answers there, he should prob. have a sleep study done - a lot of clinics (insurance pays) come to your house now so he won't have to sleep overnight in a hospital. If he is overweght there is a greater chance it may be sleep apnea.BTW I am not a dr or have any medical training. I am just someone who has had an undiagnosed sleep disorder for over 3 years and has come to know too much about all these things:) Hope it helped a bit. Jamie",
