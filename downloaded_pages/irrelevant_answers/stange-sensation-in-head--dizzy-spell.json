    "question": "I have had over the past year perhaps three or four episodes as follows; strange sensation on the right side of my head, just above temple, feels like pressure more than pain, seems to make me dizzy fore 3-5 seconds, then gradually subsides, This will sound strange, but if feels like a ripple in the pond should fee, with the center of the circle just above my temple. The sensation emanates, and then passes, all in about 10-30 seconds. Once this happened when I was driving and was quite concerning, had to pull over and let it pass. It really is painful, as much as disorienting.I am abouy twenty lbs overweight, have had no history of seizures, no epilepsy, no diabetes, no hypertension. Had EKG at my 40 yr checkup, which was 5 years ago, and they were normal.Any thoughts?",
