            "answer": "Hello,there is not an easy conversion between unit syringes and cc syringes and you have a very high risk of overdosing (= dangerous).If you are in US you might be able to buy some unit syringes over the counter at wall mart chemist or another chemist.It is very important that you control your blood sugar well.Although it is not widely discussed, it is possible to reuse insulin syringes providing:-1. You do not touch anything against the needle (except your skin when your actually injecting)2. Cover the needle immediately after use.3. If you are using a vial insulin, you need to inject air into the vial (using a clean syringe).\u00a0\u00a0The used syringe will be the one that takes out insulin only.4. Do not use the same syringe for different types of insulin.5.\u00a0\u00a0The needle can be reused several times (or even more - proving you follow the guidelines - though it will become blunt after a few uses and that may be the time to replace it).",
