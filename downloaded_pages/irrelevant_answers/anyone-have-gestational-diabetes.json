            "answer": "I was diagnosed but don't have to take insulin...sorry! I will say I cried for hours after finding out and at the time I was 9 weeks. It is hard to hear that you have it but I would wonder if you can get yourself off the insulin at some point? If you change your diet and exercise routine, is it possible to come off the shots? I would ask your dr. It was the scariest thing I heard at the time of diagnosis but how I am 34 weeks and although it stinks to have it, I have gotten used to it and I have ended up having a very healthy pregnancy other than the GD! I hope all goes well! Just remember it should go away and the diet/exercise/shots are for your health and for your baby's health!!!! Cry but try not to dwell you can do it!!!!",

            "answer": "Thanks for the info and for the encouragement! Problem is that I have exercised during 2nd and 3rd trimester. I was setting a goal for 10 miles of cardio a week. Some weeks were better than others but I've been trying! I wasnt over weight pre pregnancy? I haven't ate everything in site either and have made healthy food choices fir the most part. However I ate lots of carbs which I think is why I have GD. I ate lots of cereal and fruit! I'm trying to deal with the news but it will take sometime getting used to the shots and checking blood sugar. I know my baby girl is worth every pain I'll endure!",

            "answer": "Eating carb isn't the reason you have GD. It cause by hormones secreted by your placenta. Now of course you have to watch carbs. The hardest part for me is fruits! I still eat fruit for snack but I add a bit of cheese or nut to have protein that help slow down sugar increase in blood and keep hunger at bay. I still hate the shot but I don't take 15 min to decide to do it anymore.",
