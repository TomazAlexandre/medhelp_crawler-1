            "answer": "They are absolutely wrong in saying that hypoglycemia cannot cause seizures. A very severe low like the one your son had CAN indeed cause seizures. And those seizures stop as soon as the blood sugar levels are normalized. Usually, some twitching of muscles, sometimes shaking hands, sometimes twitch to face, happens first, so watch for those symptoms. I would suggest that you look very carefully at his diet, avoiding all high-glycemic index foods and caffeine. Keep some small juice boxes or cans handy wherever you are, and if he complains of headache, fatigue, or if he seems cold for no reason, you may want to offer some juice to bring sugar levels up. If I were you, I would ask to be referred to a juvenile diabetes specialist, who can tell you first-hand that seizures can be caused by severe hypoglycemia. No, he does not sound like he is diabetic, but severe hypoglycemia can be just as scary for parents to deal with.",
