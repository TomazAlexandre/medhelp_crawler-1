            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Your symptoms seem to be related to stress and sleep deprivation. I would suggest you to take a mild tranqulizer to soothe yourself. At the same time nerve compression in the cervical region, cervical spondylitis, and peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes and B12 deficiency need to be ruled out.I would also suggest you take a multivitamin supplement and make sure you maintain your fluid intake and eat on time.Take care!",
