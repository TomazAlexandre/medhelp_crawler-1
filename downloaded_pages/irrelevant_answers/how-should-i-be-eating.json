    "question": "I just found out that I'm pregnant on Tuesday and apparently I'm 4 weeks along. I haven't had the morning sickness or Breast tenderness or any other real symptoms of pregnancy other than fatigue. I don't have much of an appetite but this is kind of normal since I've been working from home for the past few months and I haven't been very active. I want to make sure that I'm eating healthy and enough food even though I'm not feeling hungry. I know I'm overweight 5'5 187 lbs so I want to be as healthy as possible now that I know I'm having a baby. Any tips on what kind of eating habits I should be practicing now?",
