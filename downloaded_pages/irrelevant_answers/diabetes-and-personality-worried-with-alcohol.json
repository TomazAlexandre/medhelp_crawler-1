            "answer": "Hello,You are a good friend to be concerned about your friend's husband, but if she is in denial like you say, you might not be able to do anything.....I hate to say that, but she is the wife, so she is going to have to realize it if there is a problem.Also, I do not mean this in a rude way, but alcoholics are never \"recovered\" although I understood what you meant.\u00a0\u00a0He was or is in recovery, but could have gone back to it.So, he is a recovering alcoholic and a type 2 diabetic who is also dealing with depression.My son is living with type 1, so I am not the one who knows how this feels, I do, however, know about alcoholism and depression.\u00a0\u00a0They often go hand in hand.\u00a0\u00a0Even being an alcoholic who is not drinking, but is unhappy, depressed and not being treated for depression (whether it be medication or counseling or both) can cause someone to have severe mood swings.\u00a0\u00a0I know this first hand.\u00a0\u00a0Also, high blood sugar can definitely cause irritability.I am unfamiliar with type 2 and what the meal plan looks like.\u00a0\u00a0Unless you are seeing his blood sugar results, you do not know if his blood sugar is out of control or not.If a recovering alcoholic wants to drink bad enough and does not seek help, I think eventually he or she will.\u00a0\u00a0I think the person has to get to the point where he/she likes him/herself better sober than drunk.Your situaion is a very tough one because if you express your concerns to your friend and she is in denial, she might get upset with you.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry I do not have a complete answer for you.\u00a0\u00a0I think you will receive other helpful comments.Good luckSS",

    "question": "I am afraid for my friend.\u00a0\u00a0He husband used to be an alcoholic and now he is recovered.\u00a0\u00a0He had pancreas problems also.\u00a0\u00a0Now he is a diabetic that only takes pills.\u00a0\u00a0He does not eat well or watch his sugar intake even though my friend tells me his sugar level is fine.\u00a0\u00a0Recently he had been acting very strange.\u00a0\u00a0He kinda spaces out and then he will start talking and get very irrate.\u00a0\u00a0He is very depressed.\u00a0\u00a0Last week he talked about drinking again.\u00a0\u00a0I think he is drinking again and my friend is in denial.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone who had diabetes and not eat well go into a kinda Dr. Jeckyl Dr. Hyde phase?\u00a0\u00a0I really need some advice.\u00a0\u00a0What can I do to help her.",
