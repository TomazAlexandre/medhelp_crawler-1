            "answer": "I am obviously not a doctor but it sounds VERY serious. I am going to at first go with sinus blockage but since they keep treating you for that then maybe that's not what it is. But, then again it could be a really bad infection. My second guess would be a tumor or a cyst. Like I said, I am NOT a doctor and I really don't know a whole lot about headaches but I'd be getting it checked out and demand a CT scan or something. Please go see a doctor.... I don't want to scare you but if it's that bad for you then you should demand some xrays.Another thing.. do you have glasses?? Maybe that could be a cause. Or stress.. I know when I am stressed out to no end I get really bad headaches. I have also heard that diabetes can cause headaches and vision problems.",
