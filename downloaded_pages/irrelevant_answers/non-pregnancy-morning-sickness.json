            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This is generally due to severe acidity or GERD. Several medications are available to control this. Hiatal hernia of the stomach into the diaphragm too can present this way. At times diabetes too has this type of presentation.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Over the counter antacids should solve your problem to some extent. Omeprazole too is a good drug for this. Please discuss this with your doctor and see what he thinks about it. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
