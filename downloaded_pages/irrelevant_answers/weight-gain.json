            "answer": "I think Christie has some good poinbts, but remember now is not the time to diet or skip meals. As far as actual pregnancy weight (not counting the 20lbs of water put on in the last 2 weeks) I gained 25, not counting the 20 I lost in the 4th month. I was lucky that by my 10day post pardum checkup I had lost all the weight, 45 lbs total including the water. Brestfeeding really helped. Funny thing was I didn't gain an ounce in my entire second trimester, so don't stress yet. If you are neither under or over weight, 25-35 llbs is normal.If you were to tell us you had 50lbs already, I would be concerned. But don't stress too much and don't let people freak you out, if you are concerned, talk to your doctor.Andrea",

My metabolism seems to have really, really slowed down as I've always been small naturally. With my first daughter (now 12) I gained 50 lbs. and lost it all within a month or two...Everybody's body reacts differently to pregnancy and there is a wide range of what a \"normal\" weight gain is.",

            "answer": "I didn't do well when I had the boys. I gained way too much, about 50 with both. It was really hard to get it off. At one point with my second, I gained 10lbs in one month. My doc shook his head at me. He wasn't inpressed at all. I was starving all the time. I think that is from the boys, they demand more food I swear. I am back to my normal weight now but I would never let myself do that again. It's too hard to get it off and I nursed too. Now that I am older it would be twice as hard to get thin again. The key is to drink tons of water. It is so healthy for you and keeps the weight down. But it does make you hugry more often, does for me anyway.Have a great day everyone.",

            "answer": "Pros & Cons of Weight Gain during Pregnancyby Jackie Lapetino, RNC, BSNThe amount of weight a woman should gain during her pregnancy has long been an issue for discussion. There are many different viewpoints; some physicians feel that the optimum weight for a woman should be as little as 15 pounds, while others suggest 40 pounds is appropriate. They contend that if too much weight is gained during pregnancy, the baby will be too large and a difficult delivery will result. Other physicians feel it is important to have a pregnant woman follow an unrestricted diet - after all, she is \"eating for two.\" Given these two views, what should a pregnant woman really do?The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists recommends a weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds during a nine-month pregnancy. Women who are underweight should gain a little more, whereas women who are substantially overweight should only gain approximately 20 pounds. It is imperative, however, that women be careful to eat nutritious foods so that they receive adequate nutrients for the baby and themselves as well.For most women, putting on extra weight is no problem. The focus should be, however, not to gain an excessive amount but gain only what is really necessary for a healthy pregnancy and a healthy infant. If too much weight is gained, multiple physical problems can result, causing excessive discomfort in a woman's back and legs from the added burden of carrying those extra pounds. The extra weight can also result in elevated blood pressure and an overload of work on a pregnant woman's heart. This can lead to dangerous situations both for the mother and baby. Finally, all of those extra pounds can result in a more difficult labor and delivery, and after the baby is born they are much more difficult to lose!Women who are advised to gain only 20 pounds during their pregnancy need to closely monitor their diets, ensuring that their calories come from nutritious foods, not from \"empty calorie\" groups. If an unborn infant does not receive adequate nutrition from the mother, that infant will not be able to develop normally. All of the infant's organs need to receive adequate nutrition to develop and grow, and these can only be received from the mother.Whatever weight gain your physician or care-giver has deemed desirable for you during your pregnancy, your diet should include foods that:",

            "answer": "Absolutely you shouldn't be on a severe diet when pregnant, and I am sorry if you all took my advice to be such.I am just saying, to watch and be careful.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors for the most part gloss over the importance of nutrition during pregnancy--after all, there is no expensive test or procedure they can charge for!It pays to be careful and not exceed 30-35# overall.\u00a0\u00a0If you have already exceeded that and it is still fairly early in the pregnancy, there is nothing you can do but try to be more careful, and try to increase your activity level.Doctors can't always tell by feeling and measuring whether your baby is getting too large.\u00a0\u00a0 Even ultrasound in the last trimester is notoriously inaccurate for that.\u00a0\u00a0A large weight gain puts you at risk for a macrosomic infant, a higher risk of GIP (gestational diabetes), PIH (pregnancy induced hypertension), as well as having to lose the weight after delivery.All I meant is that pregnancy isn't the time to let loose and eat all you want.\u00a0\u00a0Moderation in everything, and healthy choices.\u00a0\u00a0I think we can all agree with that.",

    "question": "Hi again all..I'm now at 21.5 weeks now with my first, and I've already gained 20 lbs. (I'm 23 years old and my pre-pregnancy weight was normal.)Over the past week, my belly has really grown quite a bit!.. I'm not eating any differently, really. I've always enjoyed sweets, and I do give into that craving at least once a day (but I was that way before pregnancy).I don't exercise as much as I should, but again, I've been that way for the past few years.Should I be worried? I still have about 4.5 months to go and I'm already really close to the reccommended weight gain- Yiikes!Thank you,-Heather",
