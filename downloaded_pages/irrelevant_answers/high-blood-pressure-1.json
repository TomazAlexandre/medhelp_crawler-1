    "question": "So the last few weeks when I go to the doctor my blood pressure is high (can hit 160/110) so each time he sends me to l&d blood work is normal and the last visit was the only visit without protein in my urine. He said he could induce me on Tuesday which would make me 36+4. At last visit baby was measuring 7.7 lbs. I have also lost my mucus plug. I also have gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My question is would u be ok woth inducing this early. I am afraid to make the wrong decision.\u00a0\u00a0My last visit which was Thursday he said he would give me the choice but not so sure of my next visit which is Tues.",
