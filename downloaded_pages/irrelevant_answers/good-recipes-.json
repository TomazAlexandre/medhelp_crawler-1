            "answer": "For ideas go to:http://www.atkins.com/Recipes.aspxhttp://www.diabetes.org/food-and-fitness/?loc=GlobalNavFFAvoid foods made with white flour [breads, crackers], starchy foods like white rice and potatoes, pasta [Dreamfields brand has only 5% digestible carbs], as these elevate blood sugars rapidly. Instead, eat whole grains, vegetables, fish, lean poultry [remove the skin] and lean meats. Eat fruits with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose [fruit sugar]. Understand the difference between Simple and Complex carbs. Although carbs elevate blood sugars your body needs carbs for energy. Going to low can create health issues besides making your sweat smell like ammonia. Good luck -",
