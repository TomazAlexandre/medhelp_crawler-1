            "answer": "Hi, my name is claire. My story starts march 2007 when i became pregnant to my partner. We were over the moon and really excited at the thought of our little one being born. due date was the 10th of December. my pregnancy was text book until i went for the twelve weeks glucose tolerence test in which i was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which is not uncommon in pregnancy. Still all went well. Because i had developed diabetes though i now had to watch my sugar intake, so i was sent to see the diabetic nurse to monitor my progress in the pregnany. Course now all the sugary products had to be got rid of as i was put on insulin three times a day to control my blood sugar levels, and of course i had to have more scans in my pregnancy than was usual. This is to watch for signs of the baby growing too large. My liver was also tested, which was fine to start with, so no worries at all. The scans always showed a healthy normal baby slowly growing and all was well.Slowly over the months i started to replace the sugar in my diet with low sugar products, and Canderel in my tea. Day in and day out i ate what i was told was good for both me and my baby and so i thought everything was going to be fine. After about 6 months of pregnany and the many tests that i had to have, something started to change. My liver was slowly getting high readings in the tests they did on me, firstly the reading were slightly raised, then a month after, they raised a little more. Nobody was worried though as they say it is very common for this to happen in mid to late pregnany, and all seemed to be going well with our baby.It was three days before they decided to induce me for our baby to be born 2 weeks before his due date. they said they dont like the pregnancy going full term just in case the baby starts to get too big with all the extra insulin floating about in the blood stream. so i prepared myself for a delivery the thursday of late november 2007. On the monday before that date though, our baby stopped moving and we became very worried. we got ourself up the the hospital as quickly as we could. I was rushed into theatre for an emergency cesarian.Our son was born on the 26th of november 2007, he was rushed into the intensive care unit for monitoring after they had realised that he had been badly compromised before he was born. These things happen sometimes and we accepted that, although we were very puzzled after what seemed like a text book pregnancy to why things had gone so wrong. The doctors themselves expressed confusion to what had happened. our sons blood chemistry was haywire and he started fitting more or less straight away and was very poorly at one point. They didnt really know what could have happened. things started to become more clear though as they examined the placenta and umbilical cord. It had developed blood clots, and in the final few days, one clot had broken away to partly block our son's life line to his mums placenta. Still we just put it down to one of those things, even though it has become clear now that our son's development will be effected by what happened. We just accepted it as bad luck.our son is now 4 month old and doing ok. The health issue is now with me. since He was born my liver reading were expected to return to normal, not only have they not, but have become even worse. I recently had a liver test done after a post natal examination caused concern over the reading. The gamma part of the test is the one that shows intake of substances that the body cannot deal with. Usually it is excessive alcohol or drugs that cause this part of the liver test to be high. A normal alcoholic will have a reading of 4 to 6 time the normal level. My reading for the gamma is a massive 10 times what it should be. I have been asked twice now by medical staff if i am a alcoholic and when i tell them that i am tee total and have been for years, they look at me with dismay and cant work out why my readings are so high. It wasnt until the doctor said. (this is something in your life style that is causing this, and usually to have reading so high you would have to be a raging alcoholic.. something you are doing is causing your liver to work hard as if its being poisoned like an alcoholic.) To this i was shocked because i know i dont drink, do drugs, medication or otherwise. my diet is still good and yes i dont even take sugar. this is when it hit me, the only difference in my life is the sugar free stuff i am eating and putting in my tea. Aspartame in all of these things. I decided to investigate and was shocked by my finding. i even saw a headline that said \"ASPARTAME THE THALIDOMIDE OF THE 90'S\" and we all know what that did to unborn babies.The liver is your chemical factory, not only does it process toxins out of your blood stream but it also makes chemicals that help our bodies to function properly. One of those funtions is to regulate blood and clotting control. my liver started to go wrong as soon as i started to take artificial sweetners, not only in my tea in the form of canderel, but also in other food stuff like angel delight and sugar free chewing gum. This is the only thing in my diet that has changed, intake of Aspartame. i am under no doubt that this is the culprit to why my system is still being poisoned and maybe the link to why our son was so badly compromised. We went to see the specialist yesterday over our son and got the results from the MRI scan. The damage to his brain because of what happened we were told by the doctor, is highly likely to cause celebral palsy. This from a normal healthy pregnancy, scans which consistently showed a healthy baby.Of course i am now off the horrible Aspartame poison and have been for almost a week. all i can do is hope and pray that the damage it had caused me is not permanent and that when i go and see the liver specialist my readings will start to fall and i dont have to have a liver biopsy. I guess at this point you may be wondering what massive intake i must have been taking to cause such problems for my health. well here is a run down to the amount i was taking. i'll let you decide if it's seems like a massive amount.On average i would have 6 to 8 cups of\u00a0\u00a0tea with two canderel in each cup.For treats i would have sugar free angel delight maybe twice a weeks.I would chew sugar free gum for a while in the day.then there are the bits that do add up. Like sugar free or reduced sugar sauces like ketchup and salad cream. Its also in options chocolate drinks i had at bed time, and in some cereal that is supposed to be low in sugar.I never drink fizzy pop like cans of coke or other flavours, but it is in dilute fruit cordial which i drunk through the summer months.Not a massive amount as you can see, but the things with Aspartame, its accumlative, it builds up and stores in your system and tissue, slowly eating away at you. A time bomb waiting to go off.I do urge all of you who read this to watch the food labels and if it says ASPARTAME to throw it in the bin, dont give it to your children, and please if you are pregnant dont even think of taking anything with this substance in it. It could be responsible for hurting not only you, but your unborn baby......ClaireI also had migraines when ingesting this stuff, fuzzy lights,headache and vision blurryiness...never had a migraine in my life before until i started sugar free and low sugar due to my diabetes.",

            "answer": "From one of the many links (see below) on Google about aspartame side effects.Aspartame Side EffectsThe components of aspartame can lead to a number of health problems, as you have read. Side effects can occur gradually, can be immediate, or can be acute reactions. According to Lendon Smith, M.D. there is an enormous population suffering from side effects associated with aspartame, yet have no idea why drugs, supplements and herbs don\u2019t relieve their symptoms. Then, there are users who don\u2019t \u2018appear\u2019 to suffer immediate reactions at all. Even these individuals are susceptible to the long-term damage caused by excitatory amino acids, phenylalanine, methanol, and DKP.Adverse reactions and side effects of aspartame include:Eyeblindness in one or both eyesdecreased vision and/or other eye problems such as: blurring, bright flashes, squiggly lines, tunnel vision, decreased night visionpain in one or both eyesdecreased tearstrouble with contact lensesbulging eyesEartinnitus - ringing or buzzing soundsevere intolerance of noisemarked hearing impairmentNeurologicepileptic seizuresheadaches, migraines and (some severe)dizziness, unsteadiness, bothconfusion, memory loss, bothsevere drowsiness and sleepinessparesthesia or numbness of the limbssevere slurring of speechsevere hyperactivity and restless legsatypical facial painsevere tremorsPsychological/Psychiatricsevere depressionirritabilityaggressionanxietypersonality changesinsomniaphobiasChestpalpitations, tachycardiashortness of breathrecent high blood pressureGastrointestinalnauseadiarrhea, sometimes with blood in stoolsabdominal painpain when swallowingSkin and Allergiesitching without a rashlip and mouth reactionshivesaggravated respiratory allergies such as asthmaEndocrine and Metabolicloss of control of diabetesmenstrual changesmarked thinning or loss of hairmarked weight lossgradual weight gainaggravated low blood sugar (hypoglycemia)severe PMSOtherfrequency of voiding and burning during urinationexcessive thirst, fluid retention, leg swelling, and bloatingincreased susceptibility to infectionAdditional Symptoms of Aspartame Toxicity include the most critical symptoms of alldeathirreversible brain damagebirth defects, including mental retardationpeptic ulcersaspartame addiction and increased craving for sweetshyperactivity in childrensevere depressionaggressive behaviorsuicidal tendenciesAspartame may trigger, mimic, or cause the following illnesses:Chronic Fatigue SyndromeEpstein-BarrPost-Polio SyndromeLyme DiseaseGrave\u2019s DiseaseMeniere\u2019s DiseaseAlzheimer\u2019s DiseaseALSEpilepsyMultiple Sclerosis (MS)EMSHypothyroidismMercury sensitivity from Amalgam fillingsFibromyalgiaLupusnon-HodgkinsLymphomaAttention Deficit Disorder (ADD)These are not allergies or sensitivities, but diseases and disease syndromes. Aspartame poisoning is commonly misdiagnosed because aspartame symptoms mock textbook \u2018disease\u2019 symptoms, such as Grave\u2019s Disease.Aspartame changes the ratio of amino acids in the blood, blocking or lowering the levels of serotonin, tyrosine, dopamine, norepinephrine, and adrenaline. Therefore, it is typical that aspartame symptoms cannot be detected in lab tests and on x-rays. Textbook disorders and diseases may actually be a toxic load as a result of aspartame poisoning.Ever gone to the doctor with real, physical symptoms, but he/she can\u2019t find the cause? Well, it\u2019s probably your diet, your environment, or both.Aspartame is the common denominator for over 92 different health symptoms at the root of modern disease. The Aspartame Detoxification Program demonstrates the most effective way to reverse disease symptoms is removing the underlying cause - aspartame.I counsel aspartame victims worldwide and have witnessed nine out of 10 clients restore their health by following the Aspartame Detoxification Program. Begin with detoxifying your body of all residual chemical toxins from aspartame's chemical make up of phenylalanine, aspartic acid and methanol and their toxic by-products, and see if any adverse health symptoms remain. Try the Aspartame Detoxification Program, and within 30 days your symptoms should disappear.",

            "answer": "Jim, I hope you are still taking aspartame. It's the ignorance of people like you that makes these products sell on the market.If you have never taken it, then I'd suggest you keep your opinions to yourself, and allow others to see what a harmful chemical this is.For your information you can't trust the government, and yes, most people will do anything for money---including and especially the government. Apparently you don't realize the power of 'power and politics'.The proof of the pudding is in the eating my friend.They tested lab rats for dental caries, now the test, instead of progressing up the animal chain before making it to humans, have miraculously skipped all those steps and finds itself on supermarket shelves along with 'real' food.Aspartame is not a food; it is a chemical and a poison.I bet they would not feed that to animals",
