    "question": "Hello! I'm a 28 year old female and have had a few incidents now where I almost completely pass out. Most recently was last week at work. The right side of my face became all numb. I thought I was going to be sick and then I collapsed. After, I couldn't speak properly or be coherent and could barely walk. I went to the hospital the next day and all my blood tests came back OK (for anemia, diabetes, pregnancy, etc. They also checked my blood pressure.)Since then, and most recently last night, I have episodes where I am very nauseous, my forearms, hands and legs get numb, I lose all strenght and become light-headed or dizzy. I don't get headaches but really feel like Im about to pass out.Also, I have glandes/lumps that are coming out behind my right ear, on the right side of my neck and groin (right side also). Sometimes, my some of my fingers and toes become completely white/yellow and numb. It's very scary!!!!I eat well, have no reason to be stressed and usually active, but since last week, Im always tired, have no energy and Im losing weight. What in the world could this be? Help!!",
