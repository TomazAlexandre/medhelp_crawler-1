            "answer": "If I was your doctor, I would get a stress test and maybe a ct angio to rule out two things: coronary artery disease and aortic aneurysm. Your symptoms of squeezing in the chest and lightheadedness would be worrisome for coronary artery disease, but I don't know your risk factors (age, cholesterol, blood pressure, family history, smoking, diabetes) but it would be prudent to ask your physician to check those out.",

    "question": "In Nov. I had pain in my left shoulder blade. It was followed by my hands getting tingly when I put my head back...if I put head forward, the tingling went away (figured it was a pinched nerve).\u00a0\u00a0Then I started getting suddenly\u00a0\u00a0hot and then having a light headed feeling (no dizziness) when i was sitting down.\u00a0\u00a0When I stood up and moved aroundd it would stop. One day last week I had a feeling of pressure on my chest (sternum area) and that night in bed, got very light headed and uncomfortable in the chest area.\u00a0\u00a0In the morning I got dizzy when I got up.\u00a0\u00a0 Now I'm having feelings at night that sort of feel like \"lightheadedness' but all over my body.My EKG looked good, wore a heart monitor for two days and nothing looked out of the ordinary.\u00a0\u00a0They have checked my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking Xanax cause my familiy doctor keep saying it's anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it is....I have nothing going on in my life to make me anxious.\u00a0\u00a0Life is good except for these strange symptoms.",
