            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This could be due to very dry skin. Itch starts first and scratching can cause welts to appear. Applying a good moisturizer will help. It could also be due to urticaria. In this case you need to rule out the cause for the hives or urticaria. Urticaria is usually triggered by allergens, such as drugs, foods, insect bites, inhaled substances, in response to sunlight, cold, heat, stress, exercise, or a viral infection. Other common allergens are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, or cosmetics. Food allergies like to gluten, lactose, sea food, and alcohol etc too should be looked into.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be due to new soap, talcum powder, clothes etc. Since you experienced an itch, just go over these possibilities in your mind. Something may strike you. In many cases, hives clear up themselves and don\u2019t require diagnosis or treatment. However if they persists you may need to see a specialist called an allergist to determine what is causing the reaction.Some liver problems and gall stones too can cause generalized itch. If you have symptoms at tip of fingers and dry skin then you need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition. Menopause in females is another reason for this. Low estrogens are supposed to be the cause.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your dermatologist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
