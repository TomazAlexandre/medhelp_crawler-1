            "answer": "I had a stress test, blood work, EKg's basically every test. All my test passed. They just wanted to do an Angiogram to see if there were any problems. That is when they found the blockages. My Dr,s were shocked to find them. I had 1 stent put in, and an Angioplasty in the other due to I need a 2 mm stent that is drug eluding, but it is currently not availiable. In the mean time, I am having pains in between the shoulder blades, which I was told is due to where the angioplasty was done. They want to repeat the Angiogram to see how things are. I am worried this may cause tissue damage,etc.I will need a angiogram done when the stent is availiable so is it benificial to have one now if there is no treatment to fix the problem now?",
