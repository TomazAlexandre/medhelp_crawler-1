            "answer": "100 is in fact in the normal range you should be fine on your blood sugars. I would check your fasting blood sugar if you are concerned. I have type 2 diabetes and was insulin dependant with both of my pregnancies. If your fasting is above 110 then I would be concerned as it should range between 80-100 after meals for a pregnant diabetic should not be above 130",
