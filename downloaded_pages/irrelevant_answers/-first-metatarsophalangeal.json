            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?I feel there is some post-operative complication like Malunion or non-union or an Infection/Osteomyletis.Did they do an x-ray after the surgery? Have they done x-ray now? If so, what is the report like?Do you suffer from diabetes?I think you should be started on pain killers.A definite re-evaluation of the case is needed by same orthopaedician or may be a re view consultation. Imaging has to be planned.They should be doing blood test like Complete blood count and sugar test to rule out any infection or diabetes.Physiotherapist needs to be involved, to start early physical therapy.Keep me informed about further line of management and about your discussion with the surgeon.Bye.",
