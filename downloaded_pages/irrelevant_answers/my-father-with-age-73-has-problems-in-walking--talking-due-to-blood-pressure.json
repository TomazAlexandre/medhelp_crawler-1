            "answer": "Have the doctors made any attempt to determine the cause of the low blood pressure?I have had problems with low blood pressure, including dizziness/light headedness.\u00a0\u00a0From my understanding, there can be many causes of low blood pressure, and failure of blood to get to the brain:I'm no medical expert.\u00a0\u00a0But from researching the issue for my own health, it seems like the cause could be neurological (autonomic failure - the part of the central nervous system that controls blood pressure is not working properly), it could be a problem with the blood vessels in the legs (vein incompetence), it could be anemia, it could be a cardiac problem, it could be dehydration, diabetes, adrenal gland disorder, kidney failure, gastrointestinal issues, or a bunch of other things.\u00a0\u00a0Have you checked with the doctors to see if they can at least determine the CAUSE of the low blood pressure?It seems like they could be doing some blood work or studies to figure it out, so they could figure out how to treat the low blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, you could try the \"short term\" fix that my doctors gave me:\u00a0\u00a0make sure he drinks plenty of fluids (this helps to raise the blood pressure some), and he could also try compression socks (these would compress his calf muscles, and hopefully get more blood going up to his brain).\u00a0\u00a0My doctors also recommended that I eat more salt in my diet, but I don't know if that would be something for your dad or not.\u00a0\u00a0Increased salt is dangerous for some people with certain health conditions.If all else fails, maybe you could consider taking him to a diagnostic hospital, like Mayo Clinic?\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.",
