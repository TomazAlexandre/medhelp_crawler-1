            "answer": "Hello,These tingling sensations that you are having are called parasthesias.Inner ear diseases like labrynthitis and Meniere\u2019s disease are common causes of these parsathesias.Labyrinthitis is an inflammatory disorder of the inner ear or labyrinth. Clinically, this condition produces disturbances of balance and hearing to varying degrees and may affect one or both ears.Meniere\u2019s disease is a disorder of the inner ear that can affect hearing and balance. It is characterized by episodes of dizziness and tinnitus and progressive hearing loss, usually in one ear.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%A9ni%C3%A8re's_diseaseI feel that you need to consult an ENT surgeon and discuss these possibilities with him.Other causes of parasthesias are injury to the back or spinal cord, Lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis, underactive thyroid,Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 or malnutrition.These also have to be ruled out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have had an inner ear infection for the past 3 weeks. I have been treated with antibiotics both orally and by shot. The ear is still not well. During this time I have developed a tingly/numb sensation in my hands, feet, legs and sometimes it feels like all over my body. I've explained this to the Dr. and they swear it's a pinched nerve but it's the oddest feeling I've ever had. It makes me feel absolutely crazy. Last week my husband took me to the ER and they said I was having anxiety attacks and hyperventilating which was causing the tingling, I've tried bag breathing, it doesn't help. I don't think that is what is wrong. As I sit here and type my feet are doing it now. When I was on prednisone, it didn't do it, but since coming off, it's started again. I have an appt with an ENT on Tuesday of next week as the fluid behind my ear is not getting any better. Has anyone else dealt with anything like this? Am I truly losing my mind?",
