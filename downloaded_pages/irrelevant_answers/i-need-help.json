            "answer": "Hi,I think you should discuss with your neurologist as to what exactly was the abnormality in your EEG. Also please get a blood sugar test done to rule out diabetes and an Xray of neck and back to rule out nerve compression. Take up some stretching exercises of limbs and take a vitamin B12 supplement. Hope it helps!",

            "answer": "I have been checked for diabetes and that came back fine. also when I did talk to my neurologist he said that the abnormality could have just been from a migrane because when the test was taken, all of my symptoms were already gone. He does want me to get another one the next time it starts up again though. I am just wondering what other people may think I should talk to my neurologist about. or what someone else thinks it might be.",

            "answer": "Hi,In that case i think that the tingling sensation that you are experiencing on your face is due to migraine. Symptoms of migraine vary from person to person and tingling face is one of them. Please discuss this with your neurologist.",

            "answer": "lol I have also done what you have mentioned above ( talking to my nero about migranes) and he thinks that it is a possibility, but I don't agree. and my reasoning for this is that I have been feeling this tingling all over my body now. almost everyday I feel it in my arms, legs, back, neck, shoulder, and every other place imaginable. its just the first time I have ever had this problem, it started with my face. and my face gets the worst of it but the tingling in the rest of my body has been getting worse. and it scares me. but thank you for putting up with reading my prob and replying. if you think of anything else let me know cuz i need help.",

    "question": "I need help figuring out what this might be.last May I started feeling tingling in my left eye which then spread to my whole face. over a period of seven days it got so bad that my eyes could not open without hard lifting. no I did not have swelling but it was tingling really bad. my lips could move and so could my eyebrows and when I touched my face with my hand I could still feel it ok. when this happened I went and had a CT scan and an MRI. but both came back fine. then after seven days it went away. well four months after that, I had another attack. except this time it got worse. it started out over my whole face, down the front and back of my head, and down my neck and through my left shoulder and halfway down that arm. that scared me so my parents and I went to see a neurologist who said I was perfectly fine. well, that scared me even more so I went and saw a different one. I also had an MRA and an EEG and the MRA came back fine but the EEG, my new neurologist said had a small abnormality in it. but by the time I had taken the EEG, my symptoms were gone, so he doesn't know what it was from. He hasn't seen me at my worst so he doesnt exactly know what he is dealing with. now I am starting to feel this tingling over my whole back and in my arms and legs along with in my face. it feels like it is gettting more intense and I can feel warmth now too. I havn't told my parents about happening right now because they are so stressed out that they think that it is because of emotional stress. but the problem is, I know im not emotionally stressed. please tell me what you think it could be so that I can talk to my neurologist and see what he thinks.by the way, its not that bad right now, and the neurologist that I am seeing is about a three hour drive away so it makes it hard to go and see him every time this happens. Being only 16, its kinda hard for me to deal with this. both of the neurologists i've been to say that they know for a fact its not MS and nothing came up on any of my tests except for the unknown abnormality in the EEG.",
