            "answer": "I am sorry to hear about your mothers condition.You are right when you say that she had none of the \"traditional\" risk factors of stroke like smoking, hypertension, diabetes, obesity etc.However, you must realize that she had two very serious pre-disposing conditions namely cancer and immobility.This deadly combination leads to what is called \"hyper-coaguable\" state: ie the blood has a high chance of clotting within the blood vessel leading to \"ischemic\" type of stroke.This is likely what happened to your mother.",

    "question": "My mother was diagnosed with ovarian cancer 13 months ago. Surgery revealed the cancer was wrapped around her intestines (stage 3). The surgeons attempted to remove what they could. Two days later she was readmitted to the hospital. Her intestine had been perforated during surgery and she was defacating in her stomach. One week later, following many complications, she was intubated in ICU. Sometime during her stay nurses noted that she was not moving her left side. Turns out she suffered a stroke... sometime. Because of her condition a CT was never done. My question? What kind of stroke do you think it was? Mom was 60. Healthy weight. Walked daily. Never had hypertension. Did not drink, smoke etc. Essentially, not a candidate for a stroke. The left side of her body is immobile; her speech is barely audible; her short and long term memory has been affected; she is highly emotionaly - cries all the time and doesn't follow convesation long. Hope that information helps in diagnosing the type of stroke. Thank you for your time.",
