            "answer": "I was BEYOND sick at my 3 hour test.\u00a0\u00a0I was nauseous, dizzy and just wanted to throw up.\u00a0\u00a0It's a combination of the fasting and that drink.\u00a0\u00a0The girl taking my blood kept saying I was handling it REALLY well compared to most women that come through for the test.\u00a0\u00a0Really well? I had to be helped into and out of the blood draw room for my last draw because I could barely stand!\u00a0\u00a0But my tests came back totally normal, so no, the symptoms you are experiencing, are not a sign you have it... It's a sign that the test is awful and makes us all sick.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "I eat the same, rawtil4, high carb fruit eater.\u00a0\u00a0I am also thinking this test is going to make me so ill! I'm taking the three hour test because I'm moving very soon and don't have a new midwife yet so the current midwife wants to be totally sure and skip the one hour. While she hasn't said much other than one comment on my \"low protein\" diet, I think she is skeptical about my carb/fructose intake.\u00a0\u00a0Ugh!! I really wanted to skip this test. Solidarity!!",

    "question": "Today I am in the lab to have my blood drawn to see if I have gestational diabetes. My baby is measuring huge so my midwife had me skip right to the three hour test, instead of taking the one hour test. I am a super conscious eater, I eat raw till 4 and a healthy vegan dinner after 4. So I am not used to having sugar like this. I get lots of sugar with my fruit but that has fiber and after fasting for this test ans drinking that drink, I feel terrible. I almost threw it up and I am super light headed... are those signs that I will have it?\u00a0\u00a0How did the test make you ladies feel?",
