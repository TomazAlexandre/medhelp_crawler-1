            "answer": "I AGREE WITH JAYBAY. YOU DEFINETLY NEED TO GET HER TO A VET ASAP!!! MY BICHON FRISE WAS ACTING THE SAME WAY. TURNS OUT SHE HAD SUGAR DIABETES! SHE NOW TAKES INSULIN SHOTS TWICE A DAY AND NOW WE HAVE OUR LOVABLE LIVELY DOG BACK. NOT THAT YOUR DOG WILL HAVE SAME THING, BUT THAT JUST SHOWS HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO A VET. MINE COULD'VE DIE FROM EITHER GOING INT SHOCK OR DYING FROM HAVING A SEIZURE OR GOING INT CONVULSIONS. PLUS IT GAVE HIM BACK HIS QUALITY OF LIFE. I WISH YOU WELL AND YOUR PET. IF THE VET CAN'T FIND A DIAGNOSIS ASK HIM TO DO A GLUCOSE LEVEL. GOOD LUCK! WOULD LOVE TO KNOW HOW SHE'S DOING.",
