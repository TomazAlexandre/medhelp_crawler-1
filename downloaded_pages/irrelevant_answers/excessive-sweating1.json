            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you work out a lot and lose important electrolytes and water, you must replenish them. Take citrus fruits like orange, take a banana a day, drink lemonade with a pinch of salt, and it would also be useful to take oral rehydration solution from time to time. This will also prevent heat stroke. If this does not help, consult your PCP to rule out thyroid issues and diabetes. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 49 yr. old remodeler living in Clearwater, FL. I work outside alot. I sweat buckets every day. I try to replenish with water & gatorade. Some days I don't feel I am getting rehydrated enough. I feel sluggish & when I get home, all of my muscles and joints ache & I normally have a headache. My question is: Is there anything I should be doing different or do I have another problem?Thank You, SEB",
