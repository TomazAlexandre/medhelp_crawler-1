            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. Lower back problems are hardly genetic, however it is more common due to obesity, inappropriate posture etc. I would recommend getting your MRI done of back to rule out the pinched nerve in spine problems. Additionally, get your blood tests like blood sugar, CBC done to rule out medical conditions like diabetes and anemia that may have same clinical presentations. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I am a healthy 41 yrs male. I had been regulary doing 30-40 minutes of brisk walking in the gym and recently added weight training in this regime. For last 3 days, I feel tingling at the tip of the finger (next to thumb) of my right toe, in the morning.....5-10 minutes after I wake up. This lasts for a few minutes. Also I had been ocassionally experiencing mild pain in the lower back, once I wake up, for last few months. (Earlier I attributed this to wrong sleeping position).My father had severe problem of L4-L5 pressing the spinal cord and pain in lower leg & feet. He was operated 5 years ago and is better, though not completely cured.Is my problem similar? Is this genetic? Is this related to weight training, as quite a few of my friends suffered similar problem like my father's while doing excessive gym. Do I need to see the doctoer right away or is this too ealry?Thanks for the professional advise on this.",
