            "answer": "Hello,Without examination, confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but it can be contact dermatitis, rash due to friction rub,folliculitis,cysts or molluscum contagiosum(multiple, small, dome-shaped papules, often with a central depression or plug).Apply warm compresses, Neosporin ointment and calamine lotion and avoid messing with it.You\u00a0\u00a0can take anti-inflammatory pain killers like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. If the lumps persist then it will be best to get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
