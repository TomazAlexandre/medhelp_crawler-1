            "answer": "Welcome to the Weight Loss & Dieting Community; we are so pleased to have you joining us and hope you will continue your journey here.There are many people who support a high protein, low carbohydrate diet, and I, too, have opted for that type of program.\u00a0\u00a0However, I also eat fruits and vegetables in smaller quantities, thus providing my body with a nutritional balance.I am concerned that the diet you are describing is so restrictive that you may be denying your body of the nutritional benefits of fruits, vegetables, minerals and fiber.\u00a0\u00a0In doing so, you may actually be harming yourself.May I suggest a few things for your consideration?Please consider eating a balanced diet, higher in protein and complex carbohydrates, but also inclusive of fruits, vegetables, healthy fats (olive oil, nuts) and low-fat dairy.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, you may want to consider seeing your physician for a checkup and some routine bloodwork, specifically a chem panel with electrolytes and blood sugar to check for diabetes.Once you have implemented this for a week or so, please consider implementing moderate exercise 3-4 times a week.\u00a0\u00a0Since you have not been exercising, start slowly by walking and then gradually add some additional exercises (cardio, strength, stretching) to your regimen.Your muscles can waste away without proper nutrition and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I urge you to consider joining us here where you can gain more information and support as you lose weight and transition to a healthier lifestyle.Best wishes ..Ranae",

            "answer": "I'm with Ranae, I'd suggest first that you talk to your dr and maybe get some blood work done.\u00a0\u00a0Then remember that your body needs all the different food groups and without them all you could most likely be doing more harm than good.In addition, it's important to incorporate exercise into any attempt at better health.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a great advocate of walking.\u00a0\u00a0Start slowly and work up a bit each day, then add other types of exercise.Good luck and hope to see you here often.",
