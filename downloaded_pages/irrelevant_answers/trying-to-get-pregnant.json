            "answer": "hi!\u00a0\u00a0You sound like you are doing everything you are supposed to do, except relax!\u00a0\u00a0I was 31 when my husband and I started to try to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0My doctors-endocronologist and ob-gyn both told me to get as healthy as possible.\u00a0\u00a0I ate right, watched my numbers, quit smoking(yes, I too had bad habits and my blood sugars were not always so good)and lost 10 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0I took pre-natal vitamins too.\u00a0\u00a0My ob-gyn told me it could take up to 2 years to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't.\u00a0\u00a0With my first child it took 2 months and with my second it took about the same.\u00a0\u00a0I have friends that it took a year and they are not diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why some get pregnant quickly and others don't.I did go on-line and found a site to help me understand when I was ovulating.\u00a0\u00a0Did you try that? I cannot remember which site it was, but I know there are many.\u00a0\u00a0 It explains the best times to try and it helps you figure out your cycle(counting from the first day of your period to find out when you are most likely ovulating) Maybe you could talk to your ob-gyn so he/she might explain more, give you more info, because I can't remember!\u00a0\u00a0or like I said do your own research.My advice is to try and not stress either-I know it is easier said than done.\u00a0\u00a0I was four years older than you when I got pregnant and I got worried because when I turned 30, my doctor(ob-gyn) told me I better start seriously thinking about what I was going to do if I wanted children.\u00a0\u00a0I did and we got our plan in action. I just wanted you to know that it will happen and you do have time.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 35 and have two beautiful, healthy children!\u00a0\u00a0I am glad I did what the doctors suggested.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.",

            "answer": "There really are reasons for all the care... diabetic women have a slightly greater chance of birth defects or of losing the baby near the end of the pregnancy (I will explain), so the really good control before and during pregnancy is not only to ensure the woman's health, but also the health of the baby. During the first few weeks of pregnancy, a great amount of fetus development is happening, and high blood sugars mean that things can go wrong. This is why it is important to have that ideal glucose level as the NORM before getting pregnant. When you get pregnant, your hormones will change, and glucose levels may rise as hormones that are more insulin-resistant increase. So the ideal is to make your habit that great glucose control that gives the near 6 a1c level before getting pregnant so you have some room for error before the baby is damaged. And at the end of pregnancy, the placenta can lose nutrition from tiny blood vessels if glucose control is poor (high glucose levels damage small blood vessels) -- if this happens, the pregnant woman can lose her baby after carrying it safely for most of the pregnancy. So extra care is taken to ensure good glucose control at that time also.When the glucose control is kept tight during this time, most women do just fine, and the actual percentages of healthy babies is almost the same as for healthier women. Many women say that their glucose control is the best in their lives at this time, and many also keep that tight control after their children are born, therefore improving their own chances of a long and complication-free life. I was one of these women, and I am now a healthy grandma with two grown healthy children. It is worth the effort you put into it, believe me. I am without complications, and other than having to test my glucose and take insulin to cover the carbs I eat, I feel that I am in much better condition than many of my overweight peers. Keep your future in mind when you start to feel weary of all the work. It becomes second nature in time, and the results are fabulous good health.I wish you the very best.",
