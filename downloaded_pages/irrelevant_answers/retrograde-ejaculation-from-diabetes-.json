            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!If the cause of retrograde ejaculation is any medicine, then stopping the medicine will cure it. If the cause is neuropathy due to diabetes affecting the bladder neck muscles then also it can be cured by certain medications and by keeping diabetes under control. The medicines used for treating this are also used for various other conditions and can be safely taken by a person having diabetes. However if treating the nerve damage is beyond the scope of medicines, then artificial insemination can be tried by recovering the sperms from the bladder of your husband after he ejaculates.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "What kind of medication can help him? Is there anything over the counter that is safe to try that we can try? If so what would be your recommended amount and time period to take a day?Also, I have looked up the information about artificial insemination. Hypothetically speaking, how much do you think those would cost without insurance? If with insurance, is there any insurance here in California that you know of would cover that? We just want to get an idea of how much it would cost to do a procedure like that. My husband has insurance I currently am not on his insurance yet, would that create a conflict with a cost?Again, thank you so much for your support and advice, this means alot to both of us. We are hoping to have a child and our worst fear is our dream not coming true.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!Let us not jump to IVF immediately. Retrograde ejaculation benefits from drugs a number of times. I cannot provide you with details of insurance. As far as I know most insurances do not cover IVF. I would sincerely advise you to consult an urologist and take the medication accordingly. Over the counter drugs are there. But as you know, this is not something as simple as a cold or flu. Hence the money spent on a specialist will definitely bring results. Your husband has insurance so you should ideally not face any problem while under treatment for retrograde ejaculation.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi I am speaking on behalf of my husband. He is diabetic and is only 24 years old. We have been trying to conceive a child for awhile now and for a good 10 months he has been able to orgasm, but no semen is showing at all (dry climax).\u00a0\u00a0His doctor believes he has retrograde ejaculation and we're still waiting for our next appointment. I have heard it is treatable by medication or by surgery. Surgery is our last resort, but is it still possible that medication will help treat him even though hes gone so long with this issue? Are these medications healthy for diabetics? And how effective and how long does it take for these medications to take some effect?",
