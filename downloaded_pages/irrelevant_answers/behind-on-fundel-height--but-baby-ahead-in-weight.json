            "answer": "I think anytime babies get under the 10th percentile, doctors worry! 45th is not bad at all.And the problem with fundal height measurements is that each doctor measures from a different starting point (some above the pubic bone, some at the bottom of it). And each woman's belly will be a different shape and size at different weeks. So long as the ultrasound showed a healthy baby, I wouldn't worry about fundal measurements!",

    "question": "I am measuring 2 weeks behind on my fundal height but at my biophysical scan the baby's estimated weight (and i know it's only a guess) puts him a week ahead of where he should be. They are keeping an eye beause of my insulin controlled gestational diabetes so baby has potentinal to get big, but my sugars are under control and at 31 weeks my baby was measuring in the 45th precentile so i wasn't to worried but now i am",
