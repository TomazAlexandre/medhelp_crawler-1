            "answer": "I am so sorry to hear that you got such news, but it's not the end of the world.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes on my 40th birthday.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 57.\u00a0\u00a0I totally understand the feelings you are having.Most of the symptoms you describe COULD be caused by your blood sugar levels being off.\u00a0\u00a0The pain in your ribs and in your back, needs to be looked at by a doctor.I found that the most important part of bringing my blood sugar levels down, was losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0I have been overweight most of my life.\u00a0\u00a0I went from being insulin dependent to just a pill every day, to control my levels.\u00a0\u00a0That was after I lost 125 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0I have kept 100 pounds off.I am a sweets lover, so to satisfy my sweet tooth, I found sugarless dessert products at the grocery store.\u00a0\u00a0I also found that not eating breads, pasta, alot of cereals, etc., also helped to keep my levels down.\u00a0\u00a0(Carbohydrates are a no-no, if your levels are too high.)\u00a0\u00a0You can eat them in very small amounts, but you have to be careful how much you consume in one day.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you already know all of this.You CAN live an active and healthy life, it just takes discipline, when you have diabetes.Please let a doctor know about your rib pain.I wish you the very best.Heatherfrom the MS Forum",
