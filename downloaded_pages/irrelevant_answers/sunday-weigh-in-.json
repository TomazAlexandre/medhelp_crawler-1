            "answer": "Whoa there --- there's nothing to be ashamed of.\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever considered that once in a while, you might need to \"splurge\" a bit in order to not feel deprived?No, you, of all people are not a quitter --- you've done such an excellent job and I'm thinking that something just isn't right for you.Are you no longer taking med for your diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Are your blood sugars staying in line?What kinds of things have you been eating?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you need to add a bit more complex carbs or something that might make you feel more satisfied?Usually when *I* get into a \"hungry\" mode -- a bowl of whole grain pasta with some chopped fresh tomatoes, a bit of sesame oil, sea salt and freshly ground pepper will fix me right up!!\u00a0\u00a0Yep, it's got more calories than I should eat, but the whole grains are good, sesame oil is one of the \"good for you\" fats that can be very satisfying and of course fresh tomatoes are pretty much \"free\", calorie wise; add a small piece of grilled chicken breast and a piece of fruit -- works for me every time....I can enjoy the meal and because I'm satisfied, I don't feel deprived OR like I need to keep on eating....You can come up with your own \"feel good meal\" based on what's available to you...Don't give up and don't feel badly -- just try to move on........and, I'm here for you, so please, let me know if there's something I can do to help.",

            "answer": "Thanks Barb, the doctor took me off my meds 3 weeks ago to see if i can control my sugars with diet alone, so far so good, but at the same time i stopped losing weight,I know for the last 2 days i havent been eating right, it dosent seem to matter what i eat, i just want more, I would put it down to emotional eating but that is something i have never done if i'm emotional then i go off my food normally,I have felt demotivated for a while and the scales not moving did'nt help,well i prayed for them to move just a pound so i could get back on track, well they did just the wrong way, next time i will need to specify they have to go down not up, be carefull what you ask for it might just happen,lol,Well I have had my 2 days of bingeing now its time to get back on track,I'm not good at following my own advice, I know how kind i would be to someone else in my situation, its just hard to do it myself,",

    "question": "Okay - hope everyone will forgive me -- I had to get up early this morning and make an hour and 1/2 trip to take care of my 90 yr old aunt, so I haven't been able to get on the computer until now...........Anyway, we're starting another week and of course, the weigh in --- I'm steady with last week.\u00a0\u00a0Didn't get off my duff and lose anything, but at least I'm holding steady.Not sure how this coming week is going to go -- I will be working 4 ten hour days instead of my usual 5 eight hour days.......I will be getting up to get ready for work at least 30 min earlier, which will put it at about 3:00 am (yeah, middle of the night)........That means I will be in bed long before dark, even though it gets dark early these days!!\u00a0\u00a0Ugh................So, I'm wondering how everyone else is doing; will your schedule(s) change much with the Holidays?Wishing everyone a HAPPY, SUCCESSFUL WEEK............",
