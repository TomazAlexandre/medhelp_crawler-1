I asked if you tried Baylor, as in Baylor Medical Center in Dallas, TX. Your bio states Arlington, TX so this would be the nearest teaching hospital in your area. Teaching hospitals are where the experts teach and practice medicine including leading specialist in spinal therapy and pain management. Yes, I'm aware of spinal issues and pain management and my reason to refer you to Baylor, and not some homeopathic remedy such as acupuncture.Acupuncture will not resolve nerve pain issues caused by skeletal problems, period. You're better off with an electric stimulation machine. In closing, to lash out by saying \"I'll check out the o0ther forums, BYe!\" is inappropriate. You really need to check your negative attitude if you wish any doctor to assist you.",
