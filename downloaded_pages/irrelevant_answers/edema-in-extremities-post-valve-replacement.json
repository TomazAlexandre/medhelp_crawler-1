            "answer": "It sounds like your doctors ruled out the possibility of heart failure due to valve malfunction and blood clots in the legs.\u00a0\u00a0Were any of your lower extremity veins taken out during surgery for a possible bypass surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If so, this could potentially explain the lower extremity swelling, which will resolve over time.\u00a0\u00a0If not, I would make sure that the kidney and liver functions are normal.\u00a0\u00a0This can be done with a simple blood test, and may have already been done.\u00a0\u00a0If, there are no identifiable causes, I would then suggest that this is post-operative edema and treat it conservatively with diuretics (as you are) and support stockings which can be ordered by your doctor or obtained over the counter at a local pharmacy.",

            "answer": "My husband had this problem and they had him wear the elastic support stockings, which did the trick, and he only wore them for about a month. It's not good to have this blood pooling in your ankles, push your doctors for answers, especially since it is getting worse. Stop the diuretics, they are of no use with this.\u00a0\u00a0The pooling of blood increases your risk of embolism, so make them address this issue.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck!",

            "answer": "I am living with something similar but in the left leg only.\u00a0\u00a0I had a Doppler study of the veins which was negative for blood clots.\u00a0\u00a0That test was followed by a 3 phase bone scan which found no fracture, no infection, no evidence of charcot arthropathy (do not look this up; the pictures will give you nightmares).\u00a0\u00a0It was concluded that I have venous insufficiency (pooling of blood in left foot).I was instructed to elevate my foot above heart level twice a day for 20-30 minutes and place an ice bag on it, and wear a tube grip (tight sock) daily.Although I am a CHF patient, it was first believed that the foot condition was a by-product of diabetes which I am also afflicted with, thanks to the medications I've been given.\u00a0\u00a0The final diagnosis in my case doesn't feel right but I've nothing else to go on for now.",

    "question": "I had an aortic valve replacement on April 14th.\u00a0\u00a0About a month afterward I developed severe edema in my right foot and now it's in both feet and lower legs.\u00a0\u00a0What could be causing this, and how can it be remedied?\u00a0\u00a0I've been taking diuretics daily for over a month with no visible improvement.\u00a0\u00a0Neither my cardiologist nor internist has an explanation.\u00a0\u00a0They have tested me and ruled out fluid in lungs and blood clots.Thank you.",
