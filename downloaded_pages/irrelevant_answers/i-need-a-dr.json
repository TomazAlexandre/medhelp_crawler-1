    "question": "I need to find a dr., I live in Cleveland, Tenn. My fibromyalgia pain is unreal. Right now, I can take a loratab, xanax, and a soma, and I can still be in bed crying. I don't want to go on disablity, I am a nail tech and getting ready to go back to work. I have taken a few months off. I feel so bad today, and hurt so bad, just the thought of going back to work scares me.\u00a0\u00a0Is there something new out there that can help me cope with the pain? I can't take antidepressants, they seem to do the exact opposite of what they are supposed to do. I need a good doctor, can anyone help put in in the right direction finding someone to treat this????\u00a0\u00a0Please help,\u00a0\u00a0thanks,\u00a0\u00a0 LIZ",
