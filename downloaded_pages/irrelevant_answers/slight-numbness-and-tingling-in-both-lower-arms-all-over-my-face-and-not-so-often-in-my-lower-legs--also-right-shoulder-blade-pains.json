            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is important to rule out peripheral neuropathy in your case. B12 deficiency, nerve damage, and diabetes can result in peripheral neuropathy which can cause tingling numbness in hands and feet.It is also important to undergo a CT scan or MRI of spine to rule out herniated discs. MRI of brain will help rule out causes like stroke and MS.Please get yourself evaluated as early as possible by a clinician. Take care!",
