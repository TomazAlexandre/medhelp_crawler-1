    "question": "I am not sure if what I'm doing is normal or not, but I could not find any eating disorder type to fit it in. Sometimes I can't stop thinking about a food I want, and I get so obsessed with it that I go on searching for pictures of it on google images. I also cannot stop eating food if it is there, even after I know I have had enough. Although I have learned to control myself, I know that I won't stop eating until the point of bursting, I don't know why my stomach never tells my brain to stop. Is this weird? My family and friends think I don't gain weight because I exercise or have a high metabolism, and they tell me I should let go once in awhile and eat without counting calories, but I know that if I let go I will never stop, and can even eat a whole chocolate cake, a tray of lasagna, and a large pizza in one sitting. Somebody please help and tell me if there's something wrong with me, and if there is what is it because I have searched all disorders but don't fit into any! I was not always like this, when I was little I was a picky eater and would stop after being full, and was skinny. After the age of 11 I started to eat more and from then on it was like my stomach was a bottomless pit. I am turning 18 now and it has been a year and a half since I've been watching what I eat and controlling myself. Please help me, is this normal, or not????",
