(:when i had the surgery this time last week, my NS did the bone trimming, the dura patch, all that jazz, and he had to shrink my right tonsil.now after surgery i am always feeling this sensation of fluid or something like that (tingling, tickly, etc) running down the right side of my neck. is that normal?i've been having a family member look at the incision a few times a day to make sure it is looking normal, not swollen, red, infected or anything and they say it is looking good.",
