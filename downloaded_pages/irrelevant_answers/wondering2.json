            "answer": "Hello,not it is not normal.\u00a0\u00a0You need to be on medication for diabetes / possibly even insulin.Your blood sugars range from 8 (144) - 17 (306) and are normally 12 (216).\u00a0\u00a0These are dangerously high. Particularly considering that normal blood sugars are never above around 7 (fasting < 5.2), and 2 hours post eating < 6.6).What you are describing is diabetic neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Without treating blood sugar to bring it down it will get worse an other complciations will also develop.\u00a0\u00a0However it is reversible with reducing your blood sugars back to normal.Your dr. should not just be monitoring he should be treating. Please go back and see him immediately.Please read the book: Diabetes Solution - Dr. Richard Bernstein.You can alsoi help yourself by losing weight, exercising daily, and eating low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0However, with sugars this high you will also need medications.let us know how you go.Aside from meds, which are necessary with blood sugars this high.",
