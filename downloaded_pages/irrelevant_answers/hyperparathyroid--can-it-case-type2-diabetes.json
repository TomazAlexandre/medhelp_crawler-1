Been running high calcium serum for a few years and been sickly for the past year. Irregular heart beats, etc. Endo doc also told me last month that I'm a the beginnings of diabetes. HUH? Then I took a stress test May 30th and found out I had a heart attack. HUH???? To tell you the truth, I really feel that parathyroidism can cause a LOT of bad things.Go to www.parathyroid.com and read all about it. They are a parathyroid clinic in Tampa Florida. Eventhough they have loads of info on their site, I've read a lot on blogs about dispointed patients.",

It will also cause HPT, diabetes, PCOS, etc, etc..It's USUALLY an inherited problem, but not always...something that helped me (although, I got some really weird looks from the Drs at first), I began packing a binder with copies of all my labs, test results, medical histories, and medications with me to Dr appointments...At one point, I had 10 different Drs I was interacting with, and I just couldn't keep everything straight...Turns out, it was a good thing I did..I became my own advocate by doing so, even if I didn't completely understand the tests results...I actually had to refuse to leave my GP's office, until she agreed to do a PTH test on me..It was 3X higher than it was supposed to be...It's called medical PRACTICE for a reason...~Melinda",

(Kinda comparable to swerving off the rail track of an oncoming freight train!)I was able to have the mini surgery, which took 1/2 hr operation...But too, I had an extensive workup, and such a positive Sestamibi scan (nuclear scan for parathyroid tumors) that it left little doubt that I had no thyroid or other parathyroid involvement.)a year later, my scar is barely visible (Dr did an EXCELLENT) job.
