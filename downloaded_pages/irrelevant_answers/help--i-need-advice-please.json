Same with my sisters baby. Our babies are 2 days apart. It took her 2 days to have hers. So don't stress :) Odds are good!",

            "answer": "I'd ask the teacher. usually if they have classes other days, you can take your final that day. like if your class ends on a thurs and he has a mon class, you can take it a few days early to be safe. Or maybe you can do it after your final class prior to that( a week early). A lot of professors are understanding if you ask ahead of time. If they say no early enough, i'd see if i could find the same class online or take it next semester, because you don't want a 0 because you're giving birth and you don't want to be giving birth and worrying about how you're missing your final.",
