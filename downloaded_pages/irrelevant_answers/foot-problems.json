    "question": "I am experiencing tinglingling and numbness in the toes and bottom of the feet? This started years ago amd was a common complaint of fellow worker who worked for WalMart and stood and walked for hours each day on concrete titled floor. I wrote it off as probably caused from my work situation. It has progressively gotten worse and I have heard that it could be related to other problems such as PVS and diabetes. I recently have a medical examination and had a EKG and blood work which did not show high sugar, What is the most likely cause of this tingling and numbness and is it possible to improve the health to my feet?",
