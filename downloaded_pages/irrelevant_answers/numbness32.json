            "answer": "Well, your post said your heart test came out normal.\u00a0\u00a0Also, normally heart problems will not affect the legs, just the upper body in the chest, neck, or arm, or all three.\u00a0\u00a0I might add that you should NOT be carrying ANYthing in that left hand or arm until it gets straight!!!\u00a0\u00a0Plus, the fact that your arm feels tired sometimes means it's really not up to the job of doing anything.\u00a0\u00a0This also suggests that somehow or other your left arm has got strained up somehow.\u00a0\u00a0I remember one time when traveling with a heavy pocketbook, that arm got really sore, so even tho you don't have a sore neck or shoulder, that doesn't necessarily mean you don't have some muscle strain there.\u00a0\u00a0I never have to carry anything these days, so I wonder, you should consider not carrying anything in or using that arm for anything for a while and see if it makes a difference.\u00a0\u00a0If you have to, put it in a sling to prevent yourself from using it accidentally.\u00a0\u00a0And of course any exercise you do that could strain that arm, quit doing it until it gets to feeling better.As to what else it might be, now that you seem to feel it in your left leg and foot, this suggests perhaps diabetes, then.\u00a0\u00a0A physician can do some bloodwork to check your sugars.\u00a0\u00a0See, diabetics get swelling in their extremities, and this will make especially their legs and feet hurt as a result, their blood circulation is not good, you see, and so their legs start to get numb, and this is actually a rather serious problem, I'm sure you've heard of diabetics whose feet start to turn black?\u00a0\u00a0This is because their sugars and glucose levels are off and this causes poor circulation on account of swelling, and by golly they'll wind up losing some toes if they get black enough.\u00a0\u00a0So, since you feel it in your legs now, you should go see a doc.Then again, could be you have been over-using that arm for something, like carrying a guitar case, or habitually picking up a stack of papers from a copy machine, or doing some running for exercise and you managed to lose your balance on the left side and didn't think too much about it, or lifted weights as usual and for whatever reason (like if you're getting older) you cannot lift what you used to, there are a lot of reasons for someone to feel strange in their left side extremities on account of doing too much with that side of the body or injurying that side for some reason.You've also had a CT scan, so that rules out something in the brain, assuming they did a full-body scan.\u00a0\u00a0I hope something in this group of thoughts rings a bell.\u00a0\u00a0And I hope you will consider visiting a regular doc and having some bloodwork done, plus he can doublecheck your heart situation, altho I do not think that goes into the feet.\u00a0\u00a0Also, one more thing just came to mind, if you recently started using new shoes, quit wearing those and go back to your old ones for a while and see if it makes any difference.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted and keep asking questions as you need to.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry I cannot pinpoint precisely what is going on, but that's why I list so many possibilities for you, so SOMEthing will make some sense to you.",

            "answer": "Persistent numbness is not normal. If you haven't told your doctor that you have experienced it in both your hands and feet, you should. Pinched nerves can cause numbness, but if you have felt it in both hands and feet, that points the possibility that the problem is coming from your central nervous system. A CT scan does not fully rule out a problem with the brain. I would ask for an MRI if I were you, in order to rule out neurological diseases such as MS.Start logging your symptoms on paper so that you have something to give to your doctor when you see him/her that will help to solve the mystery. This may be a minor issue that will go away, but it is something that a doctor should look into to be sure.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. I can understand your anxieties. Numbness in the arm could be related to a pinched nerve from compression anywhere down the route from exiting at the spinal cord level to the innervation in the arm.\u00a0\u00a0The cause could be degenerative disc disease or disc hernaition due to sudden lifting of a heavy weight or other direct neck trauma. An MRI complete spine would help localize the cause since you have numbness in the feet also. You could be suffering from sciatica. If you have numbness in the hand too, carpal tunnel syndrome needs to be ruled out. Systemic illnesses like hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus, and alcoholic neuropathy should be looked for though these affect both the limbs together. A detailed investigation should be made for multiple sclerosis since limb numbness could be a part of the many MS related symptoms along with the specific diagnostic criteria. Consult a neurologist soon as possible. Wishing you all the best.",
