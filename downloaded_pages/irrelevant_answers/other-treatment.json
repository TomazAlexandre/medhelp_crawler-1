            "answer": "Please don't type in all Caps, that is akin to shouting on the Internet.You should get a second opinion from another doctor at another hospital. Its highly unusual to diagnose foot amputation one day after toes were amputated. Something is not right with this surgeon's diagnosis.",

            "answer": "I have to agree that is odd to have such a diagnosis so soon.\u00a0\u00a0Unless the flesh is already to the point of dying because of lack of circulation I wouldn't think they'd amputate te foot too.\u00a0\u00a0I would also think the doctor could assess the situation and tell before any surgery how quickly the problem might progress to the foot or the leg.\u00a0\u00a0So, if you can I would look into a second opinion.As for treatments I know there are medications that help with circulation, but at the amputation point the toes are probably not receiving enough blod to keep the flesh alive so the medications would not do anything for that.\u00a0\u00a0So, basically all you can do with treatment is to use ot to prevent any further circulation problems, but it has to be done with good control of blood sugar, taking care of the skin, some form of exercise to the legs with whatever medications or herbal remedies you might be using.Anyway, good luck.\u00a0\u00a0I hope things begin to improve for your mother.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure amputation is a hard thing to have to face :(",

            "answer": "Dear Dot.Calm and Laceybugg77,Sorry about the caps, that is a work thing.Thanks for all your advice, we will for sure look into a second opinion. I live in the Caribbean,where there is a high number of people with Diabetes. So the majority of the time the doctors just choose to amputate,without looking into any treatments first. My mom is a lively person that loves to dance and move about on her own, amputating her foot will surely dampen her spirits and maybe even put her in a depression.Again, thanks for the advice, I will keep you posted on what is happening.Peggy",

THE DOCTOR IS SAYING SHE HAS NO BLOOD FLOW IN HER FOOT AND NOW ABOUT A DAY AFTER AMPUTATING THE TOES SUGGESTS THAT HE WILL NEED TO AMPUTATE HER FOOT NOW ALSO.IS THERE ANY OTHER WAY TO GO ABOUT TREATING THIS WITHOUT AMPUTATING HER FOOT.\u00a0\u00a0WE ARE IN URGENT NEED OF A SECOND OPINION OR SOME OTHER FORM OF TREATMENT TO AVOID FOOT AMPUTATION.PEGGY",
