            "answer": "Biophysical profile is an ultrasound basically and a stress test they do on the baby? My Dr. didn't tell me much about it. So I'm really not sure just reading up on it today onlinehttp://www.emedicine.com/radio/topic758.htm#section~IntroductionIn my situation all I was told is that,,,, yesterday at my ultrasound visit the Dr said the baby had a slightly irregular heartbeat and her kidneys were producing more urine than she could put out. Which these things were probably caused by my sugars being bad and me having gestational diabetes. She did the 1hr glucose to see what that was at. She said I need to be on a strict diet no antihistamines no sugars and no caffiene. She told me that the biophysical was just to check the babies heart and lungs, fluids, things like that. Just to see exactly what was going on with the baby for me not to worry. Well now I'm worried from what I read it could be serious depending on the results.I've read some posts where girls are like well its no big deal they just check the baby thats it..........well they were mainly 30weeks+ and close to or past their due dates. I'm just at 27 weeks, and my appointment isn't until next week so I'm worried if something is wrong with the baby's heartbeat. To me its sinking in like this can be serious but I don't know if thats normal for woman with gestational diabetes or what?! Thats why I am asking to try and get some feedback on the situation, from woman who know or have had a similar experience,,,, anything would really help!",

            "answer": "A Biophysical is a special ultrasound that tests the health of the baby and the placent. It usually is done with a NST (non-stress test) which is a fetal heartrate tracing. What an NST looks for is fetal heartrate accelerations with fetal movement. A reactive NST (a 20 minute tracing with at least 2 accelerations 15\u00a0\u00a0beats above baseline lasting 15 seconds or more) will get you 2 points towards the biophysical. the ultrasound portion can get you up to 8 points. There are certain things the ultrasound tech looks for in a biophysical such as fetal movement, fetal breathing, fluid volume, etc. (I can't remember all of them off the top of my head right now!) a 10 out of 10 is the best you can get. (8 from US and 2 from NST) It just gives the Doc an idea of how healthy and happy the baby is doing in there. Based on the results the doctor may say, everything is great, no worries or they may repeat the test later to make sure things stay good or don't get worse. If you have a low score they may consider delivery because based on the current conditions for baby it may be better to be out that in. I hope that answers you question on what a biophysical is. If you have a low score your Doc might refer you to a neonatologist for further evaluation. Not everyone needs a biophysical or NST, but if you and your baby have certain risk factors it is just a good way to let the Doctor know how well things are going!",
