            "answer": "Metformin is a diabetic medication. If it helps you with ovulation it is only because it is controlling and regulating the rest of your body. But it does not directly affect fertility.I had PCOS and was taking Metformin (I did not have insulin resistance but took it for the PCOS anyway). Losing weight is most likely the main reason I was able to regulate and start ovulating again.",

            "answer": "I also have been trying to concieve for almost a year and have had issues with ovulation. I was perviously on the Depo shot for 6 years and after going of the shot did not have a period for 14 months. My doctor gave me progestrone to kick start my period and ovulation. everything was back to normal until 2 months ago when I started having my period every 2 !/2 weeks. My doctor has not prescribed me metformin to help regulate my periods and promote ovulation. I am not diabetic, but I am overweight and that doesn't help either so I am going to work on that too. Hopefully this will help. Good luck to you.",
