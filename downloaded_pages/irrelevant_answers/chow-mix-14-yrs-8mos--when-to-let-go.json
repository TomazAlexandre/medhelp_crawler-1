            "answer": "It sounds to me as if she still has some life yet to live since she still has a good quality of life, is not incontinent, is finds pleasure in eating, and her walks.\u00a0\u00a0Blindness, and eye issues should not even be part of the consideration.When her quality of life becomes negligible, if she starts to be in pain and refuses to eat, than it may be time.",

            "answer": "Hi Debbie, I feel the same way as Dr Cheng.Her quality of life is what you have to consider, like pain, unable to be physical such as walking,eating,going out to relieve herself. Animals can adjust to blindness.One of my dogs is blind, has diabetes,arthiritis, but takes meds and has done well about 5 1/2 yrs with diabetes. He is old, but one day he looks really bad and lays around, think he is going to pass. Give him his shot, he starts hopping around like he is a puppy. He is funny. He isn't suffering so there is no reason to put him to sleep. He is a tough little fella.Enjoy your baby as long as she is not in pain or wasting away. I would put something over where she bumps her head to protect it. If you move furniture around it will confuse her. That is something you need to be aware of. RJ",

    "question": "Yes, our wonderful Chow-mix is almost 15, blind 2yrs from gluacoma & lense subluxation, doesn't hear well and bumps into most everything although she's been in the same house for her entire life. Our Vets & staff have treated her for her entire life and are as attached as we are. So I don't know if they are too close to be objective. She is a lot of work to maintain but we can't say that it's time to say goodbye to her when she so enjoys her walks, meals and naps. She has a doggy door/yard and goes in and out as needed. The question comes up because we're looking at another eye procedure to drain fluid off one of her eyes (last time was 6mos ago) and we will need to kennel her at the Vet for a trip in a couple of weeks (that's not a problem as she thinks it's here 2nd home).\u00a0\u00a0She does have a growth above one eye that bleeds and swells from time to time because of bumping into things. Do we wait until she has a bigger health issue, letting her live out her old years in love and comfort or would we be doing her a favor by putting her to sleep?",
