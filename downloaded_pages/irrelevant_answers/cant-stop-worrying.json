            "answer": "Hi I am 42 and I am 17 weeks pregnant with my 5th child. I wasn't on high risk until I found out I had Gestational Diabetes and High Blood Pressure. Being of a mature age doesn't mean your high risk. I did the screening for Downs and my numbers were good enough not to follow through with amnio. Good luck.",

            "answer": "I am 41 and 18 weeks pregnant. Baby is due Nov 15, a month before I turn 42. So far, this has been a very easy pregnancy. No morning sickness, BP excellent, no trouble with blood sugar.I think as mature moms, part of what causes us to worry is that we are more aware of what CAN go wrong. We have heard that older women are at higher risk for certain things...The fact is, women our age have been having babies for centuries. Both of my grandmothers and at least one of my great grandmothers gave birth in their 40's. One of my grandmother's did so at HOME (great grandma too). All healthy, no complications.Yes, statistically there is a higher probability that we will have an issue...but we also have (hopefully) mature coping skills, solid support systems and a whole lot of wisdom on our side to help us through :)",

            "answer": "I had a healthy amazing little boy at 40 (actually, 1 week before 41).With any pregnancy there are risks.\u00a0\u00a0There are always things that can go wrong, but the wonderful thing is they rarely do.\u00a0\u00a0As Christine said so well, women have been doing this a long time, and as you can see from this site, still are.\u00a0\u00a0I think the biggest complication in having babies over 40 is the ability to actually get pregnant (fertility declines over 35). And you got that part just fine!!!\u00a0\u00a0The reality is that yes, we have a slightly elevated risk of miscarriage and chromosomnal abnormalities.\u00a0\u00a0Still, most of the time things are fine.Whether or not to have amnio is a very personal decision.\u00a0\u00a0I personally did choose to and many others choose not to.\u00a0\u00a0No right or wrong here.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of things to ask yourself.Why do you want the info (not a judgemental question, everyone has their own reasons).\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to know in order to be prepared...I don't deal well with surprises.\u00a0\u00a0Others want to know as they would choose to terminate. Again, no judgement and no right or wrong.\u00a0\u00a0It's personal.Another thing to ask yourself is if you are comfortable with the risk associate with it. App. 1 in 400 pregnancies will have complications due to amnio, resulting in a loss of the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Do your research and talk to your Dr.\u00a0\u00a0I was comfortable with the risk, but asked an awful lot of questions beforehand, and made sure I was having it done at a clinic that I felt really good about.Congrats on your pregnancy!\u00a0\u00a0And remember...every single pregnant women worries...just about different things.\u00a0\u00a0Your not alone.",
