            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of nausea is acidity. Take omeprazole and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. Please discuss this with your GP or PCP.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
