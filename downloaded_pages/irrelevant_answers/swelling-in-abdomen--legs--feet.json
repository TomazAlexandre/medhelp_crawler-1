            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Usually conditions of heart, kidney, liver or low protein or severe anemia cause both ankles and legs to swell and swelling can go up to the lower abdomen. Hence you will need to get heart function assessed by ECHO and EKG, get kidney and liver function tests done and get a complete blood picture for anemia. Low sodium in blood, hypothyroidism and malabsorption syndromes causing low protein in blood have to be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
