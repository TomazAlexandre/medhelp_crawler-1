    "question": "For the last year and a half, maybe 2 years the skin between my eyebrows & eyelids has been very swollen. I have taken water pills, put tea bags & cucumber slices on my eyes, and have even put Preparation H on and nothing has helped. I have also cut down on my salt intake. My doctor has told me to take 2 doses of Zyrtec per day to see if it will help the swelling, but Zyrtec makes me drowsy and I do not take it because I drive pretty much everyday and don't want to get too drowsy while I'm operating a vehicle! I have hypothyroidism & type 2 diabetes, and I think that may be part of the reason why my eyes have been so swollen. I have allergies as well, but they are mild. I have been to 2 other doctors and they have also told me to take allergy pills, or water pills. What else can I try? Please help!!",
