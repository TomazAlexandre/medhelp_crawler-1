            "answer": "Hi,The main initial investigation for diagnosis of angina is a 12-lead electrocardiograph (ECG), which provides information on rhythm, presence of heart block, previous myocardial infarction, myocardial hypertrophy and ischemia. The exercise stress test provides an objective non-invasive measure of a patient\u2019s cardiovascular capacity. Thallium scan with the use of radio nuclides enhances the non-invasive detection of CHD or coronary artery disease. Coronary angiography is an invasive investigation employed to demonstrate the presence or absence of CHD.Also you should continue with the treatment and try to eliminate the risk factors for angina like cigarette-smoking status, hyper-lipidaemia, hypertension, diabetes mellitus and obesity.Consult your Doctor.The answer is based on information provided. Exact advice is not possible without a proper examination and investigations. You are requested to consult your Doctor. Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "Ive been getting chest tightness/pain while exercising and was sent for stress exercise test. I didnt get the pain while doing this and the test was fine, nothing showing. I was put on ramipril as my bp was high. I was also given a glyceryl trinitrate spray to use when I got the pain and before exercise, now this stops the pain and tightness. I was recently put on amlodipine and stopped my ramipril. Now since starting the amlodipine I no longer get the chest pain.Im wondering if this could mean I do have angina and what further test should I ask for to confirm? Thanks Heather",
