            "answer": "That is a lot of water! I think if you are actually drinking 32 oz every hour the whole day then yes that is too much. I would just be curious if you have diabetes or problems with your kidneys as I know those can cause excessive thirst, but I am not a Dr. so don't quote me. Ask your OB and see what they have to say.",

            "answer": "Certain medications can also cause extreme thirst and dry mouth, but 32 oz of water an hour is too much. In a 12 hour time span that's almost 400 oz's of water, far over what it should be. Limit the amount of water you're drinking for now, and contact your doctor.",

            "answer": "Is it actually the feeling of being thirsty or just having a dry mouth? If your mouth is feeling dry try sucking on a hard candy or swishing your mouth out with water or mouthwash. If you feel like you are dehydrated unless you drink that much water that warrants a visit with the doc. As coffeebuzz said that can be an indicator of many different issues including diabetes or kidney issues to name a few. How often are you using the bathroom? Does it seem like the same amount is coming out that went in? It's always best to have these things checked on early so you can get it under control and you and baby can have a healthy pregnancy.",

            "answer": "Yes, that's great but in the meantime please be careful. If your salt levels drop too low because of the amount of water you're consuming, it could lead to serious health issues. It can even in extreme cases be fatal. You can google \"water intoxication\" or hyponatremia to read about this; I remember a case where a woman was taking part in a radio contest to see who could drink the most water, and she ended up dying. The average person will never have this issue because we simply don't drink enough, but it is possible to drink too much water. If you really can't make it to Jan. 11th, don't be afraid to go to the ER and have them figure out what's going on with you. Better safe than sorry, both for you and for your baby. Take care.",

            "answer": "I have to agree with Mamabear on this...I would not wait until the 11th. You need to have your kidneys, livers, and insulin levels tested ASAP, just in case something's going on that needs treatment....any of these having problems could be bad for baby, too, and water toxicity is not a joke and I do think that you may be pushing it with how much you are consuming.Please speak to a doctor sooner than the 11th...or try to curb your fluid intake and make sure you're taking vitamins to replenish what the water will be flushing from your system.",

            "answer": "If it were me, tomorrow morning I would call my OB and stress how much I needed to get in right away, that you're really concerned about this. If they absolutely could not fit me in - they usually do in serious cases, they've rearranged everything during severe asthma issues with me to fit me in immediately - I would call my regular doctor and try to get in to see her tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0And if that failed, I'd walk into the nearest ER asap. I don't want to panic you or worry you overmuch, but your body is telling you something and especially because you're pregnant it's important that you listen. I really wouldn't want anything to happen to you while you wait for that appointment. January 11th seems a long way off. If it's something minor, well then it's no big deal, but if it's big then you'll be happy that you went right away.",
