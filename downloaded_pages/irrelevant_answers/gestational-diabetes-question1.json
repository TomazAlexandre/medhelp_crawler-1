            "answer": "Which test was it that you had done? If it was the 1hr usually they'll just have you do the 3hr. If your 1hr was high enough sometimes they'll skip it but in that case they'd usually bring you in sooner.... In any case if your headaches aren't going away regardless of what you do, you should be checked. It is not stupid to go to the ER, that's what they are there for. If you don't feel like going there you could also maybe see if you have an urgent care center in your area?",

Can that be linked to a blood sugar issue? I just want to no if I should just go to the ER. I've tried Tylenol, drinking water, caffeine, a little extra sleep... nothing even subdues it a little bit...",
