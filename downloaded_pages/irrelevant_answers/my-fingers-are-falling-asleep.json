            "answer": "\"About every week my left thigh becomes all of a sudden numb and tingly.\u00a0\u00a0What should I do?\"You must make lifestyle changes to your nutrition/diet, if overweight lose the fat, and perform 30 minutes of physical daily exercise. Read other threads on this forum for additional advice. You are a few steps away from having one or more of your limbs [hands, foot, leg] amputated. If you feel this will not happen to you use Google search on \"diabetic neuropathy symptoms\" to see if you fit into this nasty box. Good luck",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with diabetes type 2 a few years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Last year my vision was blurred and my glucose was in the 500s, so they put me on Victoza.\u00a0\u00a0It worked like a charm, felt better right away.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am in the \"donut-hole\" in my insurance and so it now costs $400\u00a0\u00a0whereas before it was $40. So naturally I had to stop using it and just use the Metformin. I have exhausted my resources for getting free samples of Victoza from my diabetes educator.\u00a0\u00a0Now every morning my fingers on both of my hands are so asleep and stiff that I cannot use them.\u00a0\u00a0Throughout the day it gets better but still tingles.\u00a0\u00a0About every week my left thigh becomes all of a sudden numb and tingly.\u00a0\u00a0What should I do?\u00a0\u00a0I checked my glucose is normal. What are these symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0I am 50 years old.Thank you,Angela",
