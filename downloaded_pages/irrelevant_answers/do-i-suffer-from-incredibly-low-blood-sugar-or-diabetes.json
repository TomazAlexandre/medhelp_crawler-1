            "answer": "One more thing... a good friend of mine discovered that he was having hypoglycemic episodes after playing racquetball, and he tried everything. Finally he discovered sort of by accident that the chromium in a new batch of vitamins his wife had asked him to take was the source of his problem. He stumbled across this when doing some reading. Apparently, chromium can affect some people's blood sugar levels. So if you take vitamins, do look to see if chromium is one of the ingredients. Seems like a long shot, but my friend's situation\u00a0\u00a0seemed interesting enough to pass along. He is fine now that he stopped those particular vitamins.",

    "question": "Hi. I am a 22 yr old female and I don't know what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0I am very active (cross country runner and tennis player), I workout 4-5 days a week, am 140 lbs at 6'0\" .\u00a0\u00a0For the last 8-10 months I have had the same pattern, although it's progressively gotten worse:If I don't eat first thing in the morning then I get unbelievably nauseous, shaky, irratable, and sometimes feel like I may pass out.\u00a0\u00a0I also get this way throughout the day between meals as well as after working out.\u00a0\u00a0I always try to eat a spoonful of Peanut butter before running but that doesn't always solve the problem, and I must always eat within a few minutes of my return from a workout or i get pale, shaky, clammy, and incredibly sick.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes if I get this way in the afternoon, i'll drink some OJ or a cup of diluted gatorade and that will normally have a positive affect.THen, if i eat something too high in sugar (cookie, soda, lemonade, ice cream---even in small moderation) or too many carbs,\u00a0\u00a0I get the same way: very ill-feeling, shaky, clammy, hot, and i have to lay down.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like i will either vomit or pass out.My dad is diabetic as is my grandfather.\u00a0\u00a0I just wonder if maybe I am in the pre-diabetic stages or do I have low blood sugar or even a high metabolism?Do you have any inclination of what may be causing this or what I can do to avoid/minimize these daily episodes?",
