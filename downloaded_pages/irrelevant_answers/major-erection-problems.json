            "answer": "Hi,More than your sexual problem, you seem to be having some serious health issue, losing\u00a0\u00a038 pounds in a month with out any reason is not a joke. You need to consult a physician and get a general health check up done immediately. Probably a complete blood test will show what may be affecting your health. Check for both blood pressure and blood glucose as these are most probable causes. It may also\u00a0\u00a0be due to stress or some other deficiency.You should not wait for the insurance to be available since an early diagnosis would help you to get back your health at much less cost and time frame.Good luck,Solace",
