            "answer": "Well, even though it has not happened to me, I can certainly tell you about it since one of my closest friends had it. She was diagnosed with GD and went on a diet. She only ate salads and meat, chicken or fish (moderately). No juice or fruits (just berries), only a special milk and yogurt people with diabetes, and lots of water. They told her that the baby was bigger than normal and that she had to do this. Well, she went on this diet, but failed to get rid of her diabetes. We have heard awful stories about babies and GD; but she went on to giving birth to a healthy, beautiful baby girl. I remember, just days before her due date she went in for an u/s. The doctor told her that the baby\u2019s weight was 11 lbs if I remember correctly \u2013 too big and blah blah blah. When her baby was born she weighed 7 lbs and 4 oz. Are u/s even accurate? No.\u00a0\u00a0Her baby does not have low blood sugar or anything related to that GD her mom was diagnosed with.I would eat healthy and avoid sugar as much as possible to be on the safe side. I believe working out in moderation helps. Sorry to hear you were diagnosed with GD. But don\u2019t stress too much. I am certain your baby will come to this world strong and healthy and will keep my fingers crossed.",

            "answer": "Well all I eat is salad and fresh veggies and chicken, turkey, and once or twice a month red meat. I do not like sweets nor drink juice as it hurts my insides from having severe acid reflux with a hiatal hernia. I drink alot of water and milk and herbal tea with a small amount of honey. I do eat alot of frozen and fresh fruits but more berries then cantalope and no red grapes as they do make me sick, I know they have higher amounts of sugar. I don't eat refined sugar nor fried foods, or pastas unless they are made with whole garin wheat flour. So if I do have it I have no clue what doet would help me! My OB said that I already am eating good enough and should not have it, this being my high risk OB. I am was checking my sugar becasue I had low blood suagr on the past and wanted to make sure it did not go to low during my pregnancy and it has been fine, around 86-90 first thing in the morning, the same before meals and around 110-117 an hour after meals. So this would be a shock if I have it!I am hopeing that \"smjemkg\" is right and that it will be fine and was a fluke or something.",

            "answer": "they never tested me for anemia then, that test was over a month ago and I avhe been to the OB 2x since then. Maybe they were calling to let me know it was OK, thrying to think positive! I watched some videos on your tube about it and saw this one of a baby that his mom had it and hers was boarderline and was controled by diet, he was 4 weeks early and had trouble breathing and was very sick in the hospital for a long time:( Poor little guy! Like woman have said on here \"Do not read the net\", I guess this goes for videos also! Can't wait till morning to call the OB! It is almost 3:00am and I still can not sleep over this!",

The 1 hr doesn't tell you that you HAVE GD it tells you if you have a higher risk.\u00a0\u00a0If it comes back high, they'll want to do a 3 hr test.\u00a0\u00a0If you arent' familiar with that one I can tell you more about it.",

            "answer": "thanks:) Yeah this is my 5th pregnancy so I have had the three hour before becasue where I used to lvoe all the dr's said that the screening was wrong most of the itme and just did not do it. I really do nto want to have the three hour though. I got s o sick from just the one hour. I do not handle sweet stuff at all and tried to throw it up several times. I also would have to fast for the 3hr and I have severe acid reflux with a hiatal hernia that makes it were I can not drink something without eating something to keep it down and have to eat tums like crazy when I go any length of time without eating as the acids get bad up in my esphogus. So I goy my results and they were 152 and that is high so on Friday I will talk to my dr about charting what I eat and use my glucose meter, I have from being hypoglycemic in the past and see if he is fine with that. I had been testing off and on and it never came back over 115 an hour after meals so this is confusing why it was so high. I think if I did take the 3hr it would be ok like yours!!! We shall see whta the OB says",

    "question": "I missed a call from my OB today and had my 1 hr test yesterday. Thinking it might of came back bad and is why they called me:( My baby is measuring very big since early on (around 7-8 weeks) I have never had sugar in the urine and I eat right and organic so if it is bad I am worried how I will be able to control it. I read on the net it can cause still birth and babies to have diabetes! I am scared! I was over weight when I got pregnant but still have only gained 7lbs and I will be 27 weeks on Wednesday. I already measure to be 40 weeks along too. So I would realyl like to hear form toher woman who have had GD. Also from ones who ate right and did NOT eat sweets and refined sugars and such. I have monitored my sugar off and on since I got pregnant as I have a history of being hypoglysemic and my sugar ahs always been good so if I have it I am just shocked and thinking really the only reason is my weight. I am also on progesterone and read some studies that progesterone speeds things and can casue GD> has anyone heard of this??? I am on shots and was told and read many studies that it has no side effects to mother or baby! I read the studies on March of Dimes and AAOG. Please any insite!!!",
