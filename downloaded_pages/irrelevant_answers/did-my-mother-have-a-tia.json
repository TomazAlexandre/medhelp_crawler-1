    "question": "HiThis happened barely 2 hours ago. My mother is 58 & has hypertension. There is also a history of adult onset diabetes on the maternal side of my family. My mother though is not diabetic.She was lying on the floor of our living room (in Pakistan families live jointly) & got up to go to the kitchen. Once there she experienced a sudden spell of extreme dizziness & loss of balance. I was there in the kitchen alongside so I gave her support as soon as she complained & brought her to her room & lay her down on her bed.She had extreme sweating & her pulse went down to 62 bpm.I must mention here that my mum is a medical doctor & a very good clinician. Her diagnosis is always spot on & she examined herself with her steth & said she had a TIA though she didn't experience any loss of control on one side or numbness.Her symptoms disappeared within a few minutes & I gave her about 100 mg ( 2 50 mg tabs) of water soluble aspirin immediately.She is sleeping now & she refused to let me take her to an ER.I'm worried sick & since she didn't exhibit any other symptom apart from extreme dizziness, whether she did have TNI or was it something else possibly.I would appreciate it if the community leader could get a Dr to take a look at my post.I forgot to mention that it is the exam cycle in Pakistani med schools nowadays & she had been checking papers from 12pm-6pm at the university where she is a professor.Please help me out here as I'm worried sick & would like to know what I can do to help her besides taking her to the hospital in the morning. Any precautions, prophylaxis etc?ThanksA very worried son.",
