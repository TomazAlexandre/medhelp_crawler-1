            "answer": "Haven't had it but there will be tons of info if you Google \"low carb diets\". If you could completely cut all sugar and basically all grains and not overdo your fruit intake, you would be eating a perfect diet for GD. (and a really awesomely healthy diet in general!) but at the very least you need to cut your sugar intake down to almost nothing (and don't let yourself drink your sugar - fruit juice is filled with sug, soda is of course, Gatorade, basically any drink that tastes sweet is high in sug), you need to monitor your carb intake - starchy foods like potatoes, corn, and beans are high - carb and grains are high carb so they need to be limited. Fruit is also high carb, though it's better for you than sugar or grains. Your main diet should consist of high protien, high fat, and vegetables. Meat, eggs, nuts, any veggie, coconut oil, good butter, good dairy.\u00a0\u00a0With the rise in Paleo eating going on there are TONS of blogs with recipes that will fit right in to what you need.",

            "answer": "Against All Grain by Danielle Walker.\u00a0\u00a0I would check out that book.\u00a0\u00a0Its like $20 on Amazon.\u00a0\u00a0My sister is doing this for a new healthy lifestyle and I am going to start it after baby, I am 40 weeks 4 days so I figure I will figure it all out after lol.\u00a0\u00a0But my sister has been doing this and it has done wonders for her.\u00a0\u00a0She doesn't have GD and neither do I but we have things like irritable bowel, arthritis and other problems that this type of eating also helps with. Oh and if you do this and are going to cook with Coconut flour and have a Costco near you, you can get a 4 lb bag for $7 and its organic. Good luck!",

            "answer": "I second Against All Grain. She has a blog as well that you can Google for and she's got tons of recipes on there. Something I did around the thirty- five week mark was the Twenty - one Day Sugar Detox. You should Google that as well. It's tough but it's a great Jumpstart to good diet and there are modifications for pregnant women. I have had way less of a love affair with sugar after doing that! GD is sucky to have but it might just be a great thing for you as a whole because the way you have to eat is actually great for your body period! I did the 21day sugar detox partially because I was close to having GD, although I tested under the limit. It got me going!",

            "answer": "I DO have it. Not ALL grains are bad... but yeah I cut alot of pasta and breads... etc. I still have a bagel once a week or ill have a small amount of mashed potates or noodles with dinner and my levels will be fine. Every body is different so what one person can eat and still have their levels be fine might not work for you. I can do a bagel for breakfast but I cant do oatmeal or certain cereals. Dont be hard on ur self when you do have a higher number... you just gotta figure out hii ow ur body reacts to what! I foundb out I had/have GD at 28weeks and im now 37! Its a little over whelming at first but once you grt in the groove of everything and knowing ur body its a breeze! Good luck! :)",
