            "answer": "Honestly u dont have to its just recommended u can sign ur self out at any time. So if u feel comfortable with leaving after 24hrs than do so. (As long as u had no problems with delivery at all than u should definitely stay) but i did not feel comfortable being in hospital for the 2 days i was with my first but had to be since i had diabetes and my son had to be monitored for 24hrs in special care unit.My 2nd baby i stayed over night only because i had her at 6pm so u have to stay for at least 6-8 hrs so they can check baby do blood work etc. So i left the next day. Although if its ur first baby u would probably want all the helo u can get anyway and learn everything u need to care for a baby (bath,change,swaddle, breastfeeding,sleeping position etc) so take advantage =) i am currently 38+4 weeks eagerly awaiting my 3rd and will get out as quick as possible i feel most comfortable at home and plus i have 2 other children to look after so not much relaxing for me lol congrats and goodluck =)",
