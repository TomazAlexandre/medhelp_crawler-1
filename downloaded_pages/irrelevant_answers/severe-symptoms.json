            "answer": "Hi,I think one of the things that should be checked soon is for a pheochromocytoma, which is a catecholamine secreting tumor, somewhat rare but can cause some of the symptoms you suggested including the blood pressure variations.\u00a0\u00a0This work up is best done by an endocrinologist so if you are not yet under the care of a specialist I suggest a referral soon and get this work-up underway.Take care.",

    "question": "Hello, I doubt this is diabetes related but I am in severe distress I hope you can offer some insight please.I'm a 30 year old male..Before I became ill I was outgoing with many friends, never a medical complaint in my life until age 27. Definately not a \"psychiatric\" person.But, 3 years ago I began having severe daily headaches. extensive negative neurological workup negative. I also have chronic recurring gastritis and other areas of mysterious inflammation refractory to treatments. At least with all that I knew I was going to live.But, 4 months ago I started feeling chronically lightheaded, and my chest wall felt heavy all the time. I feel abnormal throbbing pressure in my chest and side laying in different positions. Progressively, the lightheaded feeling became worse to the point to where I am having very severe episodes where I am so lightheaded I don't know whether I'm dreaming or not, I get very very weak, my bowels feel like they sink and get loose, and my chest feels hollow, sinking and cold.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing sets this off, it \"just happens\" whether in the peace and quite of home or on the road.Usually, eating a meal will help the symptoms to a degree (i think the more carbs the more it helps, im not sure), BUT my glucose has always been absolutely normal when this happens. Sometimes my BP gets elevated by as much as 50-70 systolic higher than my normal of 115/70. On that note, through the day, I can often have my BP measured 3 times in a row and get wildy variable readings like 105/60, 140/88, and 120/70.I SERIOUSLY THINK I'M GOING TO DIE IF SOMEONE DOESN'T FIGURE THIS OUT, PLEASE OFFER ME WHAT YOU KNOW?",
