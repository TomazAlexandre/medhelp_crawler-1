            "answer": "Go get your thyroid checked. I was diagnosed if February with hashimoto's disease. I have hair loss, concentration problems, dry skin, carpal tunnel, fatigue, trouble adjusting my body to hot or cold, ect and I am on the low end of the disease. Left untreated it can cause serious health problems. I would suggest re-posting this on the thyroid forum to see what they say. You may not want to get tested but I am sure you don't want a more serious disease either. Here are a couple of links that you should read.http://www.suite101.com/content/the-truth-about-hashimotos-disease-a123858http://www.healthyadvice.com/thyroid-disease-disorders/hypothyroidism-topic-overviewThe best thing to do is ask people who have had problems with their thyroid and can understand it better than me. I hope what ever the cause that you get better soon. Thank you for your service to our country, good luck and God bless.Sissie",

            "answer": "If it's not a thyroid problem you might want to look into chronic fatigue syndrome.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/chronic-fatigue-syndrome/DS00395/DSECTION=symptomsI was diagnosed when I was 15. I have on going battles with this. My doctor thinks it is onset when i get very sick (swine flu set it off in 2009 and still battling it). It always lasts what seems like forever but somewhere in the vicinity of 6 months to a year where i just never feel not sleepy.No cure but helps understand why I'm always so sleepy.Good luck. I hope everything works out for you and gets better.",

            "answer": "Mmmh !\u00a0\u00a0I have also been cold all my life, very active and yet want to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Have you thought that you may have just have overdone things for so long that your adrenals are finished!!! Hence aches pains and tiredness. The allergy compounds this, and anxiety increases the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Try asking for a tranquilliser regimen for only one a week to bring down the anxiety without getting hooked on them. Once you are not so highly anxious you can look at your depression states and start dealing with that and your addiction to Mountain Dew.\u00a0\u00a0Relax you are you and your don't have to try so hard!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You could be suffering from obstructive sleep apnea since childhood. You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. You need to consult a sleep specialist and get this investigated.Extreme fatigue could be due to hormonal imbalance of PCOD, anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 Postviral fatigue syndrome is another possibility. Persisting EBV infection or mono can also be the cause. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Take care!",

    "question": "Sorry this is going to be long, but I have no clue if these problems are one problem or many related problems or many unrelated problems and whether this has been a long term issue or whether I am reading to much into it.The primary issue is Fatigue. I am tired a good deal of the time, regardless of the amount I sleep. I can get 4 hours of sleep, 8 hours of sleep, or 14 hours of sleep and still wake up feeling grogy and the grogy feeling does not wear off. At the end of my workday, regardless of how much I slept the night before, I am barely able to keep my eyes open. When awake, I have short periods of wakefulness and energy that only last a few hours. Occasionally, I have longer spans of energy that last enough to keep me going 20 hours, but these are rare (and getting rarer). Along with the fatigue, I have allergy-like symptoms (sinus congestion, runny or stuffed up nose, sinus headaches, sneezing, coughing, sore throat every morning, eyes go from dry to runny and itchy), I feel cold unless being warmed by an active heating source, wrapped up in covers, or performing high intensity physical training. My blood pressure is lower than for most people (usually 95-105/50-60), my heart rate is around 80, my temperature runs lower than normal (97F).I am 34 years old, female, and 126 lbs and 5'1\" tall. I am in the Army, so I get a decent amount of physical activity and score well (275 or better) on the Army Physical Fitness Test. My electronic scale says my body fat is at 24%, calipers say my BF is at 22%, and the Army's taping method says I'm at 37%. This is probably due to my strange body shape as I am white with a black lady's caboose. Lately I have not gotten as much structured physical fitness (working out) but have been moving around more at work. My weight is very stable, I neither gain or loose more than two pounds. Other than the sinus pressure, the only pain I experience is from unrelated Schuermann's disease (back pain) and normal soreness associated with physical training. Running in the dust (I'm in Iraq) does irritate my throat and increase bouts of coughing. Some other health issues that may be related: hair loss, irritability, homicidal fantasies, spider veins, varicose veins in feet, extremities always cold, slight depression due to separation from wonderful husband, fluctuating appetite, soft stools, feet and hands go numb easily, knee joints burn when I sit for long (10+ hours) periods of time, cannot pay attention to more than one thing \"tunnel vision\" when concentrating). The fatigue problem has been most my life, but has been more pronounced the last 2-1/2 years, and has been extreme the last 4 months. My allergies may have been lifelong but kicked into overdrive while living in Wiesbaden Germany 2-1/2 years ago. I have always been cold.Family History:Father's family - severe dementia, Parkinson'sFather - 70 and in very good health, no issuesBrother - HyperthyroidismSister - unknown, I suspect her of hypochondriaMother - Deceased at 64, died during open heart surgery for valve blockage, High Blood Pressure, Too many platelets in blood, several strokes, calcified heart due to rheumatic fever (why her surgery failed), High stressMother's family - high blood pressure, strokes, diabetesPersonal History - have always been \"sleepy\" type even as small child, wake naturally to urinate then go right back to bed, stays awake later at night, pulled several \"all nighters\" and a few \"all weekers\" in college, only refreshing sleep was as a child I would sleep in the car on summer mornings and one time in Kuwait when the power (hence the AC) went out and I slept for 20 hours straight; have always been colder than everyone else, long johns go on in Oct and come off in Apr; have a high metabolism (have suspected hyperthyroidism) that has only slowed slightly in the past two years; had frequent colds as a child (may have been allergies); never had the flu till I joined the Army; chicken pox at age 10; only undiagnosed illness was at age 22 - had spell where I was weak with uncontrollable shaking for about half an hour, felt very weak for few days after with no appetite for a week; addicted to Mountain Dew, drink 4-6 cans a day, only thing that makes me feel awake other than something exciting to do that day, have massive withdrawal symptoms comparable to those of a heroin addict and further withdrawal causes shutdown of mental functioning (only got through basic training because no one paid attention to me while I was on KP); diet is normally decent with lots of home cooked meals with fresh veggies, meat from hunting/local farmers, a few boxed or canned items, fruit, homemade breads and pastries, real butter NOT margarine, olive oil, and fresh fruit. Current diet of ramen or horrid DFAC food.I switch back and forth between Claritin (24Hr) and Allegra-D (12Hr). The Claritin makes me less grogy, the Allegra makes my already low BP and temp drop even more. I can't really tell which works better, and neither seem to work as well as sleeping in a hot car. The only other prescription I'm on is Depoprovera and otherwise I take ibuprofen and tylenol as needed. I have had no tests or blood work because things like diabetes and thyroid problems will get me kicked out of the Army and I still have 12 years before I retire.",
