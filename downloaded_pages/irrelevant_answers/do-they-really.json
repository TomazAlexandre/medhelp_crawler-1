            "answer": "I had gestational diabetes with my 3rd pregnancy, my son was not huge (7lbs 13oz) he was 4 days early and came on his own. Having GD was not horrible, I thought so at first and thought I did something wrong, but honestly it ended up being just an adjustment. Better portion control, eating healthier and I didnt gain as much as I did with my first 2. Now I'm on my 4th and last pregnancy and no GD this time (38wks6days). You will be ok;-) Best Wishes!!",

I know I have to alot to change and its all for her and will be totally worth it I'm just scared on how to change 25 years of eating habits. I feel like at 38 weeks she's safer out then in but I want her to come on her own I don't want more stress on her if that makes sense.",

            "answer": "It makes complete sense;-) changing eating habits is hard, I know, and paying attention to all the carbs is frustrating too. I actually learned a lot though;-) but u r right, it's what's best for your baby. My suggestion is using measuring cups to help and finding all the freebies you like (I think carrots was one, can't remember) and snacking on those things so u don't feel like your starving. If u have any questions don't hesitate to inbox me;-) I also ended up needing to give myself insulin shots, but it was all worth it in the end;-) take care!!",
