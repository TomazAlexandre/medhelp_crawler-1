            "answer": "Yes, I am aware of the studies being conducted in reference the genetic link and environmental link of developing Type 1 Diabetes and trying to prevent the onset. I have also looked into these studies since my daughter was diagnosed. These studies are being done all over the country. These studies are fairly new and need to continue for several more years before any conclusive evidence can be found.I have also read about and gone to a seminar in reference to the research on starting non-symptomatic people related to the diabetic with insulin in hopes of not developing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Here again\u00a0\u00a0the research has no t been done long enough to prove that it prevents the onset of diabetes.Unfortunately I have not heard, read or seen anything that would prevent or minimize the onset of diabetes Type 1.In reference to the cousins that are overweight, they should try to reduce their size as obesity can lead to type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The risk of type 2 can be greatly reduced by weight loss and proper diet.\u00a0\u00a0I would have them consult their doctor as to a healthy ways for them to reduce their risk of developing type 2 diabetes.For more information about research\u00a0\u00a0follow the JDRF links to research. Hopefully once they find a cure for diabetes they will find a way to prevent anyone wlse from developing it.If we can be aof any further assistance please feel free to\u00a0\u00a0contact us again.",

    "question": "My children have Type 1 diabetes on both sides of the family (maternal grandmother 40++ years) and paternal grandfather ~ 8 years).\u00a0\u00a0Many years ago my mother-in-law investigated what should/could be done for \"preventing\" diabetes in our children.\u00a0\u00a0At that time one course of action was to begin low-dose insulin shots PRIOR to any symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I essentially ignored that advice.\u00a0\u00a0To date there are no symptoms in any of our children (20, 15 and 12) and they are each in excellent physical shape and condition, and eat extremely well-balanced meals.Are you aware of that study and course of action, and what has been the outcome?\u00a0\u00a0Also, just because our children are in great physical condition, is there anything else we can do to prevent/minimize onset of Type 1?There are obese cousins in the family as well, but they have only one known genetic link, their paternal grandmother.\u00a0\u00a0Should they do anything different?Thank you,",
