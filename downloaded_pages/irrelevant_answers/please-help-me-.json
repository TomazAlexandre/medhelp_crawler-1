            "answer": "Hello.You could be having the autonomic neuropathy due to diabetes. If diabetes is not controlled adequately, autonomic neuropathy develops. Diabetics are also found to have a lower mean pressure of the anal sphincter. Anal sphincter is nothing but certain group of muscles which control the anal opening.You need to undergo certain tests including nerve testing to diagnose the cause and the extent of the problem. Treatment modalities include medication, biofeedback, exercise of the anal muscles and surgery.Please consult a neurologist and an endocrinologist.Regards",
