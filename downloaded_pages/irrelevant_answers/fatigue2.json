            "answer": "Yes. Like everyone complaing about heaviness or discomfort on chest, all the test came back negative. My doctor tested me for diabetes, thyroid, kidney and liver functions.The condition gets worse when I eat eggs. I do experience this even though I do not eat eggs or food containing eggs. My doctor suggested doing sleep study, but my insurance will not cover the test and I am not sure that is the case. It does not happen everyday. My doctor is not extremely concerned about this, but it is a big concern for me. I do not think this is normal. I am not sure whether I am allerugic to other foods and/or some things accumulate in my system.",
