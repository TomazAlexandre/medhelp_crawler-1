            "answer": "Typical HIV sufferer,I don't agree with that doctor at all because HIV is never diagnosed or suggested by symptoms,only an HIV test at 4 weeks to 3 months will tell you if you have HIV and besides you never had an HIV risk in the first place.You need to continue to work with a medical professional until you establish what's wrong but it has nothing to do with HIV and if I were you I would change doctors.Thrush is very common when taking antibiotics or even if you use the wrong soap,etc.I really believe you were given terrible advice.",

            "answer": "I would suggest to get very serious with your nutrition. Something that I find is a good gauge is a Palaeolithic (stone age diet, caveman diet, paleodiet, etc) approach, as you will be eliminating many things, i.e. especially sugar, wheat and milk -- try that for at least one month.",

            "answer": "Thank you! As much as I kept telling myself that, I needed to hear it from someone else. It was an ER doctor, so no - I will not be returning there again. I can appreciate GU medicine is not their forte, but there was no need to scare me like that in my opinion.",

    "question": "Hello everyone.I'm looking for some advice and clarity as I feel terrified after visiting ER.I am a 27 year old man. I'm very slightly overweight, I smoke 20 a day and yes, there is a big history of diabetes in my family.I have had recurring NSU and thrush for a number of months. My sexual health clinic keep testing me for everything and it's never come back as Gonorrhrea or Chlamydia, just NSU. I get given azith or a dose of doxy and it seems to clear up - then returns again. My only sexual encounters in between these \"flare ups\" are unprotected receptive oral sex from different partners.At one stage, the NSU detected progressed to a full UTI and as the azith for NSU had failed, they treated me with doxy and it cleared it up.I also developed - out of the blue - pneumonia before Xmas and according to my sexual health advisor the subsequent thrush was as a result of the antibiotics given to me for the pneumonia.NOW, I have had NUMEROUS blood tests and I do NOT have HIV, not that I have ever really put myself in a high-risk situation for catching it anyway.However, last few days very raw and painful skin on my penis and inflamed glans, but no discharge and no real pain while peeing - so I think it's another UTI and I go to ER. I also began to notice VERY OCCASIONAL sharp stabbing pain behind my testicals and pain in my abdomen, especially on one side.Doctor there has completely freaked me out!Number 1 my urine didn't show any signs of anything. After hearing my history, he has said I have presented at least 5 signs of a typical HIV sufferer and has advised me immediately to go for more testing. Apart from the fact, I KNOW I don't have it - I have had 3 HIV tests since first UTI incident last September and one since pneumonia - to hear this type of thing from a professional has me now terrified. Especially given he said that thrush and a UTI is SUCH an uncommon thing for man of my age. My sexual health advisor had me under the impression these were actually more common in men than many thought.I accept my immune system is very low at the minute - poor food, lack of sleep, smoking etc. They keep testing my blood for diabetes and again, nothing out of the ordinary.Yes, I will follow this up with my sexual health clinic.But in the meantime I need to hear from someone that my symptoms can be down to a poor immune system - AND that a poor immune system is possible in a man of my age - for the very reasons I've listed above, not just a HIV sufferer.An HIV test is an incredibly traumatic thing for me, especially given the wait. And the fact that I know - aside from receptive oral sex, which carries little to no risk - I am VERY careful with my sexual health.Can anyone advise?",
