            "answer": "How are you? How is your mother-in-law? Does she have diabetes? Chronic kidney or chronic renal disease, is a progressive loss of renal function over a period of months or years through five stages. The most common causes of CKD are diabetic nephropathy, hypertension, and glomerulonephritis.

Abdominal ultrasound is commonly performed, wherein kidneys with CKD are usually smaller\u00a0\u00a0than normal kidneys.
