I hope you find this forum as helpful as I have.Some times of the day are slower than others, but keep checking back if you don't get many answers right away.\u00a0\u00a0I still haven't figured out when is the most busy time on the forum.\u00a0\u00a0I think it varies from day to day.I think this is the place to help you find some answers or at least learn some more questions to ask your doctors, and how to prepare for a doctor's visit so that you get the most out of it.Have you checked out our Health Pages at the upper right hand corner of this page?Wishing you well,Kathy",

I really want to welcome you to our forum.\u00a0\u00a0No matter what this is, or is not, you will find friendship, compassion, support, solid information and genuine kindness all given from our hearts.Thank you for coming our way.\u00a0\u00a0Looking forward to getting to know you.Be well,SL",

            "answer": "Yes when I have head pressure, I get very scared and my heart rate goes up. Now after the MRI, I am actually slightly better anxiety wise.I kept going to my doctor with my head pressure, dizziness and some 4-5 months ago I was standing and I felt loss of balance. At that time I did not worry about it much but it all started coming back and I told the doctor about it. He did some blood tests for liver, kidney, cbc which were normal. I had gestational diabetes during both my pregnencies, so I do check my sugar level every year and they have been normal. When I went again with the head pressure complaint and occasional riging in my ears, doctor said we will start with MRI and here am I. I have two sons 71/2 and 21/2 years old. I worry about them now but they are also my source of inspiration to get better. I have a wonderful husband, always optimistic and supports me.Thanks for all the e-mails. It makes me feel better to share my thoughts with you all.-Kavi",

The head pressure did not go and I feel dizzy sometimes. I had an MRi done on June 2nd. The results were ..There are a couple of periventricular and subcortical signal abnormalities. Demyelibating disease could not be excluded. Alternatively this may represent chronic ischemic white matter changes. There is no acute infarct. Could this be MS or something else? Please let me know.",
