            "answer": "My doc also switched me to dilaudid for back and joint pain as it is less addictive than oxycodone, no acetaminophen like T3's and has minimal effect on the liver.\u00a0\u00a0Here in Canada acetaminophen is acceptable up to 4 g/day with a healthy liver. At 650mg every 4 hr you are getting roughly 3.25 g/day so I would definitely switch to the dilaudid.\u00a0\u00a0All in all less is better for your liver anyway.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to explore alternate therapies for your sciatic pain such as massage, acupuncture, nerve block etc.\u00a0\u00a0Every little bit helps to protect your liver until you find out where you are with stage and extent of damage.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Hep C. No genotype yet. I am currently taking\u00a0\u00a02 Norco 10/325 every four hours for cyatica nerve pain. Now my doctor wanted to change due to the acetamenaphine. He is talking about dilaudid which I have taken in the past. My question is, Does anyone else out there have chronic back pain, and if so, what are you taking as pain medication that works and wont have adverse effects on my liver? Thanks for your help in advance!!",
