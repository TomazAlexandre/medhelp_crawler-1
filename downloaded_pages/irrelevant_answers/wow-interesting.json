            "answer": "I think you should see a kineasyologist.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you could have candida, and they will be able to pick this up, and treat you.\u00a0\u00a0GP's wont be able to test for this.\u00a0\u00a0The kineasyologist will muscle test your body to pick up if your deficient in anything, and if you are having a reaction to any foods or anything else your coming into contact with.\u00a0\u00a0Basically, your body tells them what is going on with it.\u00a0\u00a0Candida is very common, especially if you have ever taken antibiotics for anything.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is it is a very nasty condition to have, and very common to have.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms are not just thrush!\u00a0\u00a0In fact you can have it and not have thrush.\u00a0\u00a0Depression, irritability, foggy head, headaches, concentration problems, PMT/S, etc etc etc.\u00a0\u00a0What happens in candida is that your body is producing too much Oestrogen that your liver cannot process.\u00a0\u00a0Another symptom is mucas on the stools, and anus discharge could therefore be connected this.Also, try dabbing TCP (diluted) on your anus. Any infection, can produce puss and smell, and could be helped by this.Alternatively, sexually transmitted disease tests should rule that side of things out!",
