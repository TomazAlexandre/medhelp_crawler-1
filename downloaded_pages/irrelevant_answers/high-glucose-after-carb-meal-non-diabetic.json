            "answer": "\"Is the less than 180 for non diabetics too?\"Doesn't matter, its the same for everyone.Best time to test is 2-3 hours after a meal. You're getting a false positive testing 1 hour after as your glucose hasn't plateaued. Its not wrong to do, just too soon.\"I wonder why it would be high in only the morning after I eat...lot of stress...morning anxiety.\"Four common causes for high glucose are:1. The foods you eat2. Not enough exercise3. DehydrationAnd, in your case...4. Stress - When your stress level goes up, it sends a signal to your body that initiates that 'fight or flight' syndrome which causes your glucose level to go up, as your body prepares to expend extra energy. Try to lasso your stress level, it will not only keep your glucose from rising unexpectedly, but also make you feel better.",
