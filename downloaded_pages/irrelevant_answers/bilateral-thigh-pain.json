I did have a back injury 4 years ago and 2 years ago, out of nowhere, I tore my right thigh muscle. The thigh pain as gotten increasingly worse over the last two months and I know I should see a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to check out the internet first, when I came across this forum.\u00a0\u00a0I will be watching for any comments.",

I suffered from terrible headaches for the last 4 years, but this is my first really bad bout of symptoms elsewhere on my body.\u00a0\u00a0I have had tingling in my limbs, itchy skin, twitches, vision problems and other minor symptoms, but this is pretty scary for me to think I may not be able to walk one morning.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.It sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of leg blood vessels), deep vein thrombosis or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "I have been experiencing pain in both of my upper thighs. It does not seem to be an issue when just walking around but when trying to get up from a sitting position and walking up or down stairs there is pain in both upper legs. In addition there are times at night that I am unable to sleep because the pain is pulsating in both legs. This is very uncomfortable. I am not sure what the cause of this. I have been walking a mile to a mile and half atleast every other day. Again the pain is not bothersome with just walking.",
