            "answer": "I'm glad to hear you're getting a second opinion. Your current Dr may very well be right with your diagnosis but it never hurts to get that second opinion.There are treatments for PSOS, if that is what indeed you have. Getting a hysterectomy is a major operation and a Dr will only do the surgery if everything else has been tried first. I had the surgery myself and it did not take away my anxiety.It sounds like you've had a lot of stress going on in your life. Are you in therapy? If not I highly recommend it. There are also medications to help with your anxiety.",

            "answer": "Your story sounds similar to mine. Doctors kept telling me that I was just having panic attacks and brushed me off for a long time. Since having my daughter 9 months ago...all hell has broke loose with my mind and body. I have gone through every test available and been given the thumbs up...yet I am crippled with crazy symptoms and panic. Recently, a doctor suggested that I look into getting my hormones checked out. He said an imbalance may very well be the culprit. I will be doing that in the near future. I have already seen a GYN and had testing done with them, but it seems that it is related to an adrenal imbalance. The symptoms match perfectly. I am looking into natural remedies because I would rather not subject myself to any side effects...I already have enough symptoms and don't want to add to the list. I don't know if any of this is helpful to you, but thought it may be something you might want to look into. You never know, it could be simply fixed and your suffering would be over. Good luck.",

I was never tested for pcos, just told I have it because I was showing signs of menopause and too much testosterone.

I just don't feel like my anxiety is mental . I feel like it only comes during hormonal changes. Like the first time I remember having one I was on BC for first time. Then I had them off and on and I stopped BC and got pregnant,\u00a0\u00a0lost the baby and immediately got pregnant again. I had anxiety until\u00a0\u00a0I started zoloft between my miscarriage and 2 pregnancy. Then after he was born I had it a little. Until he was like 3 months old. After that I don't remember any major ones until my 3rd pregnancy after I had her. Since she's been born in 2010, I developed hypothyroidism,\u00a0\u00a0and supposedly pcos,\u00a0\u00a0and I've had maybe 6 ones since she's been here. The last 3 I remember were trying to regulate my period with BC again ... trying to get off zoloft,\u00a0\u00a0and this first period on metformin .",
