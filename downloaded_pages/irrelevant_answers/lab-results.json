The results of the study revealed that the low serum 25-OHD concentration in patients with hemochromatosis is directly related to the extent of iron loading and it is improved by venesection therapy. Venesection therapy is removal of excess iron.\u00a0\u00a0About 450ml of blood is removed once a week until the iron stores are in the low normal range, as determined by the serum ferritin concentration. This may take 6 to 12 months and then done approximately every 3 months to maintain the serum ferritin between 50 and 100ug/L.When iron levels are high, it can accumulates in the body and eventually lead to serious problems such as:* arthritis* liver disease, including an enlarged liver, cirrhosis, cancer, and liver failure* damage to the pancreas, possibly causing diabetes* heart abnormalities, such as irregular heart rhythms or congestive heart failure* impotence* early menopause* abnormal pigmentation of the skin, making it look gray or bronze* thyroid deficiency* damage to the adrenal glandsIron overload >>>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_overloadHaemochromatosis >>>http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/hemochromatosis/Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in hereditary hemochromatosis: relation to iron status >>>http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3838288",
