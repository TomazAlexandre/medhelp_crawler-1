            "answer": "Hi Kumar,I am not a doctor, therefore I cannot answer your question in any scientific/medical terms. Your best bet would be to check with a doctor or peruse professional medical literature to find more specific explanations.My understanding of insulin resistance is narrowed down to the basic concept, which is that in insulin resistance patients the muscle, fat and liver cells don't use insulin properly causing excess glucose to bulid up in the blood. However, I can't explain the intricate workings of this condition. Maybe someone else on this forum can help answer your question in more detail. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Thanks.\u00a0\u00a0Possibilty of vascular wall inflammation due to visceraladiposity, glycated substances, unsaturated fats etc. , decreases in capillary densities (vaso obliteration), decreased movments due to obesity are bit indicative on internests in some scattered studies. Glucose and some other substances as sodium are hygroscopic and may attract water in blod lowering blood tonicity. Probably as such, cells of vascular walls may swell and effect transcapillary movements. Athrosclerosis,\u00a0\u00a0of arteries,lipids depositions etc. may also have such impact.Are we sure that resistance of glucose intake by cells or insulin resistance is a normal physiological disorder to avoid excesses/toxicities to cells or a defect/pathology?",

    "question": "Hello,Insulin resistanc is a common condition along with diabetes type2. I want to know, can it be possible that target tissues get lower amount of insulin due to some resistance caused by vascular wall inflammation or decreased in capillary densities?",
