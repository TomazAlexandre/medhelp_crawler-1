            "answer": "Go to a different vet and get a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0I have never heard of a vet who would just say \"I don't know what that is, you need to put him to sleep.\"\u00a0\u00a0Anyone who would make a diagnosis like that doesn't need to be in practice.\u00a0\u00a0As much as you love your cat, you owe it to him to take him to someone who is at least going to make the effort to figure out what is going on with him.\u00a0\u00a0It could be something simple.If I had to guess at what it could be, it sounds to me like your kitty is producing an overload of porphyrins.\u00a0\u00a0Porphyrins are secreted at times of stress as reddish brown goopy \"tears\" and around the nose, and it sounds to me like this might be what is going on with your kitty.\u00a0\u00a0Only a visit to the vet will tell for sure, but the one you went to should definitely be crossed off the list of competent veterinarians in your area.Please let us know what happens.Ghilly",

            "answer": "I totally back Ghilly!!\u00a0\u00a0This makes me soooo dang mad when vets tell ya to put an animal to sleep because the animal is old.\u00a0\u00a0They think the problem is not worth investigating.\u00a0\u00a0The vets that are that lazy and ignorant should be the ones to be put to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0LOLGet a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0I would tell the vet at the very beginning of the appointment that you don't want to waste your money if they're just gonna tell you to put your cat to sleep without investigating.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not kidding tell them this before you put out the money.\u00a0\u00a0You might find a problem that's fixable and you could get a few more years with your baby.I did have a similar thing happen with one of my cats-he had the brown junk around his nose and eyes, too.\u00a0\u00a0I would just wipe it everyday and realized that it was old caked up soft food that he didn't wash off.\u00a0\u00a0My cat was eating and drinking.\u00a0\u00a0So, that could be part of your cats problem that he's just not washing his face.\u00a0\u00a0Since he's not eating, this is worth looking into.The problems worth looking into with older kitties are-kidney disease (urine and blood work), thyroid disease, diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Or, it might be an infection.I would request an x-ray, full blood work that looks at full blood count w/ liver and kidney panel, thyroid (blood test) and diabetes (blood).\u00a0\u00a0Also, get his teeth looked at.\u00a0\u00a0This is important with older kitties, if one or more teeth are bad the cat won't eat.With these tests, I am pretty sure that you'll get some, if not all, your answers.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure that the brown gel gook is old food.\u00a0\u00a0I am glad that you did not listen to that idiot of a vet that told you to just put the cat down.\u00a0\u00a0He was an insensitive jerk!!Please keep us posted and we will keep you and kitty in our prayers.",

    "question": "Scooters my 16 year old cat has gotten this brown gel like stuff around his eyes and his mouth and it really stinks. We took him to the vet and he said that he has never seen anything like this before and that they should put him down. I mean I know he is old and everything, but if there is any possible way to fix it I would love it I have had him since I was 4 years old he really means a lot to me. The last week or so he hasn't really been eating or drinking and he sleeps all dayand the only time he gets up really is to move positions. He really hasn't meowed in his life until now and its now really a meow its like a cry. Do you have any advice or help for me?",
