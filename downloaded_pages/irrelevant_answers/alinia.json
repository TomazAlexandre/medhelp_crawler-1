            "answer": "Sorry to hear that standard treatment did not work for you.\u00a0\u00a0Alinia is available in the US by prescription only, and it not 'standard of care' for treating hepatitis c, so whether or not you can start again with Alinia added would depend on whether or not you could find a physician agreeable to prescribing it 'off-label' for you. You might find some useful information here:http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/580934Certainly worth a discussion with your hepatologist/GI or whoever your treatment physician is.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to you.hrsepwrguy:Alinia is not part the cocktails most people are referring to when we talk about \"Triple\" therapy (DAA+Riba+Inf); it's actually an anti-protozoic medication approved for use to treat certain organisms that can cause diarrhea, is actually not currently 'approved' by the FDA for standard hcv treatment.",
