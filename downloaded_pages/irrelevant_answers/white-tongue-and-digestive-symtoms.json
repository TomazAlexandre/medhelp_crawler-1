    "question": "For the last 7\u00a0\u00a0months I have developed a number of bizarre symptoms that I cant seem to shake.\u00a0\u00a0I am usually a healthy guy and rarely get sick.In August, I developed what I think was a sinus infection coupled with digestive issues (multiple loose bowel movements every morning) within about 10 days the sinus symtoms cleared up (without antibiotics), but the digestive symtoms stayed.I also developed a white coating on my tongue that seemed to get worse with sugar. When I avoid sugar my tongue clears up and digestive symtoms slightly lessen but don't disappear.I have a loud gurgling stomach, increased belching and flatulance (although not a huge amount). My mouth symtoms also include dry/slightly sore mouth and some white mucusy strings on the back of my throat.So far all blood tests and the stool sample are normal. Negative H-Pylori, negative, negative thyroid issues, negative diabetes. Slightly high bilirubin. Also a swab culture on my tongue was negative for fungus.I'll finally be getting in to see a GI in a few weeks, but I could really use some advice about what this might be. It's ruining my life.",
