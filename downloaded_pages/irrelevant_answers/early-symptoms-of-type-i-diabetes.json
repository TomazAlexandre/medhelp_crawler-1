            "answer": "As you may know, we're not physicians here but are folks with considerable experience with Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Do check out anything you read here with your pediatrician or a specialist.Type 1 does usually show up rather quickly, but that doesn't mean there aren't possible markers ahead of that dx.Slowed growth and hair loss are not among the symptoms usually indicating Type1.\u00a0\u00a0The usual symptoms include excessive thirst, weight loss (related to getting more skinny rather than slowed growth in stature), frequent urination and sometimes lethargy, irritability.What you describe may be related to other hormones including thyroid or pituitary.\u00a0\u00a0This info from NIH describes hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone):http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/000353.htmIt is not uncommon for folks with Type 1 to also have thyroid issues since they're both endocrine glands that can be attacked by an overactive immune system.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 and some forms of hypothyroidism are auto-immune diseases.Seek out a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0YOu don't give your daughter's age, but I'm assuming she's still quite young.\u00a0\u00a0Whaqtever is the cause, you are giving her the best chance of successful treatment by pushing the docs 'til you get a proper diagnosis & treatment plan.\u00a0\u00a0Trust your instincts ...\u00a0\u00a0Good luck & please do check in again for more comments and with an update when you have one.",

    "question": "Does Type I diabetes always present with a rapid onset in a child or are there cases where the patient has a history of symptoms that could indicate developing problems?\u00a0\u00a0My daughter had always been in the 95 percentile for growth and two years ago had slipped to the 75th.\u00a0\u00a0Her hair recently started falling out and I took her to her MD and she is now in the 50th percentile.\u00a0\u00a0Although primarily healthy, when she gets sick she runs high fevers (105) and had fever of unknown origin twice at 4 and 6.\u00a0\u00a0Although never diagnosed with it, I would say she has hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0We are having blood tests done but if anyone has any info/experiences to share I would appreciate it.",
