            "answer": "I can totally relate to your symptoms except for the numbness or fullness in your arm. I have had all the tests as well all come back normal. I admit not knowing whats going on is the hardest part. I have gone from being able to multi-task while multi tasking to not remembering what month it is and signing my maiden name on a check when I've been married for 12 years!! Math problems, forget it I now carry a calculator with me and a note pad because i must write everything down immediately or 5 min. later I will totally forget.My Neuro thought it was temporal lobe seizures, however all testing has proven that theory wrong. I am now going to see an endocrinologist for further thyroid testing as well as more sugar testing. I do have thyroid goiters ( non cancerous) but all lab work is normal. My theory is it's either my thyroid or lyme disease, thyroid probs. can definately be related to lyme disease. Both can be a clinical diagnosis based on symptoms, but it's important to have the right Dr..Check out these links- maybe they can give you another avenue to look downhttp://www.canlyme.com/patsymptoms.htmlhttp://www.lymenet.com/www.stopthethyroidmadness.com",

            "answer": "I'd also like to add that I never thought I was depressed or anxious in anyway, but after speaking with my dr. she put me on a trial of an anti depressant only 5mg. per day. She knew that not having a diagnosis for more 9 months had completely worn me down.I took it because at this point I'm frustrated!! I must admit after 5 days I did feel a little improvement. Now I'm not saying i'm cured or that depression was a primary diagnosis I am saying that instead of getting angry that I make mistakes or forget something important - I now longer get down on myself, call myself names etc. I move on quicker and attempt to focus on something else. It's not easy and every day is a struggle, it just eases the way i handle the struggle. So in short anxiety and depression can add and magnify things whether we believe it or not. Sometimes we need a little help so that we can find a true diagnosis. So if you must try an anti-deppressant than go ahead, it does NOT have to be permanent.Good Luck and best wishes- hope you find what is wrong! keep us posted on your progress!",

            "answer": "Hi after reading a few of your symptoms. I was diagnosied with gastroparesis (slow stomach emptying) 3 years ago, but then I started experiencing other really weird feelings in my body, which doctors kept saying were psychosomatic or menopause, as every blood test done showed nothing. I finally figured it out myself after overseeing one test that came back with a blood sugar level of 2. I believe the levels should be between 5-11 in australia. When I questioned the doctor he said it was because I was fasting, however it was not, I had this test done 2 hours after eating lunch. I do not have diabetes. I have low blood sugars, that fluctuate all the time, one minute I would be perfectly fine and the next minute, like a light switch went on and a sensation that I could not explain apart from saying bizarre would creep through my body, I'd feel faint, tingling lips, dizziness, confusion, strangest feeling in head (thought stroke) very frightening, I would almost pass out, weakness, heart ponding, this would keep coming and going. I would then instinctively drink a can of lemonade or eat something very sweet, which seemed to make me feel a lot better, however after 2-3 hours I would experience these attacks again and sometimes even worse, as now I believe when the blood sugar raised with the sweets it would then a few hours later plumpite again as I was not eating anything to sustain a balanced level - so I was peaking. I then started to wake at night calling out in my sleep then experiencing the same dreaded feelings. I have now started eating every 2-3 hours and lighter meals (heavy meals still play havic with me). I have been relatively attack free except for 4 months, which is the first for 3 years, If I do experience attacks I instantly eat 6 jelly beans which pushes my blood sugar levels ups and eat a piece of wholemeal grain bread, as when the levels drop, they only drop half way and then meet the food I have eating, so seem to even out. I had been living this nightmare every day for 3 years - I can't tell you the relief I feel know there was actually something wrong with me.....hope this can help you...but please make sure you keep seeing your doctor.and leave no stone unturned..sometimes\u00a0\u00a0there are several reasons for these symptoms, don't give up...they kept wanting to stick me on antidepressants but I wouldn't as i new there was something physically wrong - listen to your body and try and break up the different symptoms.1 check are you menopausal (you are neve to young)as out of balance hormones are horrific.2. Thyoid similar to menopause symptoms.3. Maybe your low blood sugars aren't regulated - we can still experience unstable blood sugars.best of luck",

    "question": "For a little over a year I have been having trouble with confusion that seems to be increasing.\u00a0\u00a0I have never not known my name etc., but my surroundings look unfamiliar and recall only small bits of what happened days ago.\u00a0\u00a0If I do recall it seems it was months or years ago. I also get odd pressures and pains/burning in my head, have blurry vision at times, swaying sensations, get tingling in my face, and a numb or full feeling in my face and left arm. I also get weak, shaky, nausea, lightheaded,palpitations, occasional tremors.I have had 2 CT scans, and MRI/MRA of the head and cervical spine, EEG, ENG, EMG, extensive blood work, separate MRI of the brain....all negative.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had negative echocardiogram and holter/event monitors. I don't know what else could be done or where to go. I am concerned that something is being missed, all the while it seems to be getting worse. I am 29 years old.Any suggestions would be appreciated.",
