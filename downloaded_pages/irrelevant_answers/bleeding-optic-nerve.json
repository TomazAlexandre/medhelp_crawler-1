            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Any bleeding behind the optic nerve is serious as it can damage the nerve and cause subsequent loss of sight.The causes can include trauma, diabetes, high BP, high pressure in eye etc. If this is detected on routine exam, it may not have impending seriousness, but needs to be immediately controlled. Minor bleeds heal. Major ones need to be drained. Please consult an eye surgeon immediately. Take care!",
