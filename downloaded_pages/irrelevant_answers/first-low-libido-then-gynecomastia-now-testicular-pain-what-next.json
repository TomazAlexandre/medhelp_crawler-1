    "question": "Hi,I'm a 49 year old male. Last year I developed gynecomastia on my left side; the year before that my sex drive started to plummet for the first time; my erections are now weak and intercourse is therefore brief; my total testosterone about three months ago was a flat 300; I still have no sex drive and now some e.d.; i suspect that on those rare occasions (once every few months) I do have sex, I sometimes have dry orgasm; and for the past two days my left testicle started paining me and swelling somewhat.Clearly I need to see/change my doctor. But tell me: What are the possibilities here?Puzzled",
