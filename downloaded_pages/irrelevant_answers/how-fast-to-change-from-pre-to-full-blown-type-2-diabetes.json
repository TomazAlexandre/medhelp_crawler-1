Poke around for there is a section on prediabetes prevention.As far as \"how long should I wait to see dr about pain/tingle/numbness in arm/leg/foot\". You should see a doctor asap. You didn't mention whether you were administered any cardio tests during your ER visit. I would expect the minimum of a treadmill test with a cardiologist present to rule out any heart issues. Diabetes would be the least of my immediate concerns until this is ruled out.Good luck and good health.",

            "answer": "Yes! You do need to worry!!! I was diagnosed with pre-diabetes for about 3 years, then slipped to diabets. My book sugards fluctuate,\u00a0\u00a0the highest 168, and lows around 98. Weight is also an issue, but before my husband passed away, he was diagnosed as pre-diabetic, and only weighed 139lbs. It's how your body process, or doesn't, the carbohydrates and sugars you eat. I lost 40 lbs after his death, and I have more trouble keeping stable than when I was extremely overweight. Stess,, anxiety, depression, can all contribute to diabetes and controlling it. Good luck, and work on it. Daily\u00a0\u00a0figer sticks are no fun!",
