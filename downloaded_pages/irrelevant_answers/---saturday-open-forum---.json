That would scare the **** out of me just packing up and leaving the countryGood for youBlondie-- Exciting time, I would say build\u00a0\u00a0and you can make it whatever way you like it but I guess you would have to evaluate your finances,etc....Debra maine--When I tested it was from the begining of the meal, I phoned the doctor and asked because it does make a big difference with your sugars. 10-15 min difference If I took it after I ate it was always down. Start of the meals sometimes I was over depends what I ate. I think I was only over once with spagetti, I only ate a bit but I didnt calculate in the sauce!!! AHHHHEveryone--Hope you have a good day and DONT forget the bunny comes tonight",
