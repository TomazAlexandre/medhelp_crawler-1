    "question": "OK so at about 12am I think I might have taken an extra 24 unit shot of lantus, meaning I think i might have 48 units of the stuff floating around me rather than my usual 24. It has been 2 1/2 hrs nw and I dont feel low but I am still extremely worried. How bad is it if I did do this and would I necessarily know by now if I did? I really cant remember if I did it twice or not but im really scared that I did and 24 extra units seems bad. Suggestions please.",
