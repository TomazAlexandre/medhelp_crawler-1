            "answer": "Hi there, if u are not eating it's no wonder why u can't focus. Not eating will throw your BS's all off. Diabetes is a disease that can be controlled or it will control u. Everyone knows Type 2 diabetes is something U can change. And your O energy could be from not eating and you might have to high BS or Low. And u said your Cholestol was odd? Are u yellow from the beliruin being to high. What is the cause of this? Do u have heptic problems? And if u lost hope, remember u arenot alonewith this disease millions have it and itswhat we do with it that make a big difference. And one last thought, if your liver is having high biliubin your BS will be all out of wack. i think u might need a new dr. I don't know one that would just say u have bilirubin spelling into your blood stream and not find out why and not help u.....",

    "question": "I have been recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, I'm 36 years old, quite healthy, definatley not over weight and I get this gift bestowed upon me. I must say when I first was told i was Diabetec I thought I was being handed a death sentence. The old, my feet would fall off, my kidneys would fail and I would die hooked up to a dialasis machine. But things have come a long way. My problem is I have lost hope, I don't take care of myself, i rarley eat, it takes everything I got in me to get outta bed in the morning to goto work to support my family. I am always so tired, i have zero energy, lack of intrest in nothing, I have the attention span of a nat and my short term memory is just messed up. I'm in the IT Field (Information technology) I get paid for what I know and what i cans olve and there have been times i can't remember something that is bred into me. I don't know what to do. All i want to do is sleep, it's affecting my family, my job and my life. Any input would be greatly apprecited.Thanks for your time.",
