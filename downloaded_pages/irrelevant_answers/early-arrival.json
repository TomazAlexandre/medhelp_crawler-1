    "question": "Due date originally May 10th. Aja Renae born 4/13/2016. Went to work on the 12th, then felt extreme sciatic pain & pressure under my belly. I called my doctor since I had an appointment anyway. They told me to cone in early. I get checked out & have not yet dilated. The pain sibsides but they wanted to monitor the babies heartbeat since I was recently diagnosed with gestational diabetes. I was told after over an hour the baby was OK but I had to go to the hospital for more monitoring since my sugar was a little high. Once at the hospital after a few more hours, I was admitted for overnight. The monitoring continued, then I was told by my doctor the heartbeat was to up & down. Only other choice to avoid complications was for an emergency c-section. So unprepared for everything that happened but so blessed & thankful my beautiful baby is here & OK. No longer a May baby, but alive & well. So in love with her!!!",
