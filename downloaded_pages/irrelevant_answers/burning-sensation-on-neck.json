            "answer": "My skin will sometimes feel as if it is burnt, but only if I touched it. I chalked it up to stress. I never went to the doctor about it, but noticed that when this happens, it is usually when there is an elevated amount of stress in my life. Hope all turns out ok for you. My \"burnt areas\" was usually on my torso or arms. Eventually it went away! Comes and goes with stress.",

            "answer": "I was tested for diabetes cause one night I was on my computer and then all of the sudden, my head like fell and when I looked back up The room was spinning, and my arms were tingling from my elbows down. I had a really bad headache for 8 days preceeding that, that any over the counter meds would not even remotely help. After that episode, the headache finally went away.I thought I had some kind of stroke but, the doc said no. That if I had a stroke, then only one of my arms would have been tingling. My headache was at the base of my neck(where the neck connects to the head), slightly to the right, and the pain radiated from there.They never could tell me what happened to me that night. I still have no idea what all that was about.",
