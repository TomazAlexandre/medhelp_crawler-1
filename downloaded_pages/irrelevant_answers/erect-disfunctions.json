            "answer": "hi,Long-standing diabetes can cause erectile dysfunction even if blood sugar control has been good.An evaluation by a urologist will help identify the exact area of the deficit and will help to initiate measures to manage the problem.If the problem is vascular, as is the case in systemic diseases, corrective measures can include phosphodiesterase inhibitors, such as sildenafil (Viagra), tadalafil (Cialis), etc.). These can be prescribed by your doctor after an evaluation including physical and laboratory exams.Additionally, men with diabetes can develop varying degrees of hypogonadism which can result in testosterone levels being lower than usual. This can be determined on hormone assay and decisions regarding replacement can also be explored.Some drugs can cause retrograde ejaculation where the semen does not flow out at orgasm. Structural abnormalities of the prostate can also cause this problem.You will need to consult a urologist for a detailed examination and based on the results, intervention can be undertaken. Given the advances in medical science, it is unlikely that you will have to deal with this as a problem for the rest of your life.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.regards,",
