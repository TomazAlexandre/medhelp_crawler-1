            "answer": "Hi Jaded. Yeah, I have heard that you can get muscle spasms in your chest...is that true? I do get occasional chest pain (and I have an INSANE family history of heart attacks/diabetes/strokes, etc.), but I don't worry about it too much because it doesn't happen often and it's just little pangs of pain if that makes sense.Labellacandie, I would definitely ask your doctor just to be sure, because the heart isn't anything you want to mess around with.Flower",

            "answer": "Hello and Welcome to the Pain Management Forum. I am sorry to hear about your unusual pain but glad that you found us and took the time to post.You are young enough that it should not be cardiac related. However one should never assume that because you are not fifty or more that you could not have a problem with your heart. Females present differently than males however \"pinching\" pain is rarely associated with an MI (Myocardial infarct).Several thoughts come to mind but remember I am not a physician or an expert. A pinching pain is usually related to the chest wall itself rather than the heart. Stress or anxiety can cause this pain. Is it associated with other symptoms such as shortness or breath or perspiring?Another thought is costochondritis which is the inflammation of the cartilage between the ribs. This will usually resolve in four to six weeks but there are exceptions.As much as we all hate to so this I encourage you to make an appointment with your PCP and have a good clinical evaluation. He/she will probably order an EKG and check the blood levels of your cardiac enzymes. An echocardiogram is always a good tool to evaluate the structure and function of your heart.As suggested above it could be muscle spasms but only a physician can give you a correct diagnosis. I know these symptoms can be frightening. I am sorry for that. And remember that anxiety can increase our pain, actually any pain.You are always welcome here but you might also want to post on our Heart Disease Forum. You can locate it by clicking on the word Forums on the upper left hand side of this page. The forums are listed in alphabetical order. They may have better suggestions than we do as they are geared more towards heart issues.Please let us know how you are doing and what you discover when you consult you physician. Feel free to ask additional questions and participate in our forum. You are always welcome to join us.Best of Luck to You,~Tuck",

    "question": "It may not be anything at all. Just curious and wonder if im the only one. Every now and then I have a certain feeling in my chest but don't quite know how to describe it. I can try by saying that it feels some what like a pinch. Yes like someone would be pinching me but a long pinch that would last several minutes and again its on the middle of my chest but more towards the left. Have any ideas? It maybe just be othing to worry about, just though i'd ask, thank you.",
