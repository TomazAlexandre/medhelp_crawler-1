            "answer": "You drink a really sweet drink that the doc gives you. They give it to you then you wait an hr an they test your blood to see if you have diabetes. Even if you didn't have diabetes before you got pregnant some woman get it while being pregnant then it goes away after giving birth..\u00a0\u00a0An your doc should give it to you when you're around 28wks.\u00a0\u00a0That's when I got it.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of women say the drink tastes nasty an made them feel sick, but it didn't do that to me. I chose the fruit punch an I liked it, didn't think it was that bad an it didn't make me sick at all.\u00a0\u00a0 Oh yea an if you fail the first test you have to go back an do a 3hr test.",

            "answer": "I had to do a 3 hour glucose test because when my sugar tested around 10-12 weeks it came back high. Mainly because I ate that morning (Im pretty sure thats why my sugar was a little high) and I didnt know I was getting blood work done at my Ob/Gyn appt. The thought of possibly having gestational diabetes was scary and stressful. I did the 3 hour glucose and I had to drink a sugar drink within 5mins and get blood drawn every hour. My results came back great and I dont have diabetes.",
