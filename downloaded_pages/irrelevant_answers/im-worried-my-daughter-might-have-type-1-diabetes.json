    "question": "My usually happy and healthy 11 year old daughter the past 2 weeks has been very sick. It started out like the stomach flu, she threw up and was tired a lot. After a few days she started getting extremely thirsty all the time and urinating very frequently. She's also noticeably lost weight yet it seems like she's eating more. She's just not been acting the way she normally does even when she's sick, some days she's been very weak and a couple day ago I smelled sweetness on her breath. I am terrified that she might have type 1 diabetes but my ex who she was staying with when this began thinks I'm being ridiculous so I've withheld taking her to the doctor. Should I be worried??",
