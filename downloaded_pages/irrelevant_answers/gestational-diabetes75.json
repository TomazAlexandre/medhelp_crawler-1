And a 9 lb baby feels the same as pushi g out a 6 lb baby trust me I've done both.",

    "question": "Hi ladies I'm currently 34 weeks pregnant with my first and I have gestational diabetes. The doctor has told me that my baby is 6lbs!! But I've still got another month to go!!! He said that my baby could be born of around 9-10lbs. My baby is still breached and the doctor is afraid he won't fix it self because he almost doesn't have enough room in there.\u00a0\u00a0Has any of you ever gotten diabetes with your pregnancy? If so when you had you baby how much did it weight? How about a breached baby?",
