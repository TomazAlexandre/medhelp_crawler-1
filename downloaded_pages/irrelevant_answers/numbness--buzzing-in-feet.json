            "answer": "Stress does not cause neuropathy, but during an illness such as pneumonia (or any porlonged illness) there are various stressors on the body such as decreased nutrition, decreased activity, etc which can contribute to the development of a neuropathy. Neuropathy just means peripheral nerve damage - which can be very mild and reversible (usually when only the lining of the\u00a0\u00a0nerve is damaged) to severe (when a part of the nerve may die and not recover). Recovery can take up to one year, although startes within weeks of reversal of the stressors. Sometimes this is called 'critical illness polyneuropathy'. There may be some residual symptoms - the sensory nerves in the feet are among the most susceptible to damage as they are the longest distance from their source of nutrition/origin close to the spinal cord. Hence there may be some intermittent or fluctuating sensory symptoms in these areas. It does not rule out another cause like a pinched nerve, but it si a possibility.Good luck",

            "answer": "Hi Guys, This may or may not seem rediculous to you, but I have a suggestion for you both. I have had similar problems to you with the buzzing and burning plus a whole lot of other symptoms I won't go into. As yet I am undiagnosed as my MRI was clear. But my Neurologist had one possible diagnosis and that was Hyperventilation. Apparently when the brain gets too much oxygen, it can cause all sorts of weird symptoms - estecially buzzing extremities and neuropathys. One cause of this can be stress, but in both your cases, I wonder if the pnuemonia could have kicked it off - given it would have been hard to breath and maybe you over compensated and began to breathe too much. Its just a thought - I'm no doctor, but I started to wonder where things like post sex and exercise exasperations where happening for you. Its been ruled out for me, if anything, I don't breathe enough. It'll be interesting to see what the neuro says.Good luck.",
