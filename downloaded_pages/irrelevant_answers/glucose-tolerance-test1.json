            "answer": "Yuk! That stuff is disgusting I hated having to drink that. The first time I had to drink it I cried, lbs! I didn't pass so I had to do it a second time, which was even worse because you have to drink more. I had gestational diabetes during my first pregnancy, but not the second. This is my 3rd pregnancy and I told my doctor I'm not excited about drinking that \"deathly\" sugar lol! So I was advised I could bring in a 16oz bottle of 100% real juice and if I could drink that in 5mins,that would suffice instead of drinking that sugar poison. Lol! Just glad they came up with a new method.",
