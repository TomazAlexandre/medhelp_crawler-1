            "answer": "my dog of 11 years showed signs of diabetes and cushions at the same time. a big white lab named Stoney . he is on trilostane and\u00a0\u00a0has improved alot. cushions is not something you want to mess around with. i give him ice water and keep him cool. you will also need to have him tested for his cortisols levels while on trilostane. i assuming he was tested before he was put on it. make sure he dose not have diabetes it is hard to tell the difference sometimes.",

            "answer": "She panted a lot but I wouldn' say it was laboured.\u00a0\u00a0She also seems to be a bit unsteady.Trilostane really scares me from what I have been reading as side effects.\u00a0\u00a0Also, my vet did not tell me to have the cortisone levels checked.\u00a0\u00a0I only found out about that from reading the package insert.\u00a0\u00a0Not very happy about that.One vet in the clinic thinks she should not be on it because the high cortisone levels help with the pain. My little one also has cancer and I am thinking that they figure she is goind to die anyway.We just want to keep her comfortable and as happy as she can be with all of this going on.I am at a point where I don't know which way to go.",

            "answer": "Your poor girl definately has a lot going on, and you must be going nuts trying to help her.\u00a0\u00a0Our vet also didn't suggest having the cortisone levels checked, we had to call him and suggest a recheck.\u00a0\u00a0After that she had to be put on Prednisone, which didn't go over very well with her.\u00a0\u00a0I definately would not return to the clueless vet, either take another one in the clinic or go somewhere else, where you are confident they are making the right decisions for your dog, and not just guessing.\u00a0\u00a0Other than shots, I will never return to our dogs vet for anything serious, I have no confidence in him .\u00a0\u00a0Were you told what would happen if you didn't put your dog on the Trilostane?\u00a0\u00a0Try to stay calm in front of her and make each day as enjoyable for her as possible, rides in the car, sitting outside with her in the grass, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you can find a vet that can give you his/her honest opinion of what they think your next step should be, I wish you much luck.",
