            "answer": "It sounds like he has a naval infection.\u00a0\u00a0This can be caused by wearing tight jeans, rubbing of the area, improper cleaning, piercings, swimming/ bathing in dirty water, or anything that causes dirt or little air to get into the naval.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0It is not recommended that ointments be used because it actually can keep the area moist making it worse.\u00a0\u00a0Tell him to keep the area clean using soap and water, ensure it is rinsed and dried well.\u00a0\u00a0When washing and drying it would be better to not scrub or rub the area hard because this too can make the problem worse.\u00a0\u00a0If he starts having pain, a fever, or the drainage becomes foul smelling he needs to see his doctor because he will probably need some antibiotics to heal it up.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Bleeding from umbilicus or navel or belly button could be due to fistula, boil, infection or in women due to endometriosis. Umbilical fistulas are narrow tubes connecting the outer skin with anything inside like intestine, mesentry etc. Boils in the umbilicus can also burst and release blood and pus.\u00a0\u00a0In rare cases it could be Meckel\u2019s diverticulum.\u00a0\u00a0Do consult your doctor. A swab test of the sticky discharge should be done and culture and sensitivity tested to start appropriate treatment. Diabetes should be tested for as this may cause infection to linger. At times colored X-rays are taken after injecting dye to know if there is a fistula.You can treat this by applying a warm cloth to the area. This encourages the pus to come to the surface and drain. Once the boil has drained, the area should be washed with antibacterial soap and an antibacterial cream applied and kept dry, bandaged and sterile.\u00a0\u00a0However, the possibility of sinus should be ruled out. Take care!",
