            "answer": "Hi. I was induced as well but it was at 40 weeks. I was nervous at first. Basically, you check into the hospital and they start giving you small amounts of pitocin**spellcheck starts contractions for you. As the hours rolled by they increased the dosage little by little. I checked in about 7pm. The next morning, 6am they turned the dose all the way up and started manually dialating me. After about 30 minutes of the contractions (because they have to let the contractions mature first), I was given an epidural. I started pushing at 1:35pm and had him at 1:51pm. It wasn't a bad experience at all.",

            "answer": "Well,if you are scheduled to have an induced labor,it is because it is necessary.i had my first born through the same.i would say it was easy for me,because it was my first time & I was expecting worse.i didn't use epdro to manage the pain . my advice is, don't be scared, be positive & all will be fine. Remember to be calm . breath through your mouth in and out . don't scream, because you need to save that energy for pushing . it will be well!",

            "answer": "@bsBritney23, I'm 37 weeks, I'll be 39 weeks whenever they induce me. And same, she didn't say anything about me needing to be induced until just now - even after my GD diagnosis, we had been planning on a natural birth so this threw me for a loop.@Patriciaaa02, ditto! I wanted him to come on his own, even embraced the idea that he'd be overdue; I was prepared for that. This, though I feel like I should be ecstatic, I'm not. I've heard and read about way too much horror stories about how induction is not only super hard on your body but that they often can lead to emergency c-sections, and I had wanted to avoid that at all costs! I'm not liking this and feeling like my wishes are basically being disregarded, especially as my midwife didn't even give me a valid reason for why she wanted to induce me.@HzAngel, thank you for your input! Did they induce you and then send you home to labor, or did they admit you into the hospital to monitor you? And that's basically what I was told with our LO, that it would either be very difficult for me to conceive even with medical intervention if I managed to successfully carry a many at all. There's so many thoughts going through my head right now!",

    "question": "So ironically after posting a long, venting post on here today at my weekly checkup my midwife informed me that due to my gestational diabetes that she was going to schedule me to be induced in the 26th. I'm terrified of this, I never wanted to be induced, and frankly don't understand why it's necessary if my baby isn't showing any signs of distreas in the womb, but I feel like she isn't giving me much of a choice... Is it advisable to ask the other attending physician if he thinks it will be necessary, and if it is, are there any other Mommies who have undergone the induction process that can give me an idea what to expect?",
