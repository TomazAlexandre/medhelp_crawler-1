Of course we do it for the babies but that doesn't make it any funner. My family had a barbecue last night and I couldn't eat any of it because of the buns. So i had an omelette. I might be bitter. Haha is your baby measuring big at all?",

            "answer": "I'm 36 weeks with GD and on insulin. I struggled for awhile trying to find a diet that worked for me. I too was always hungry and sometimes I still feel like that. My issue was I would intake the amount of carbs and do all the right portions and my blood sugar readings would be of the charts but when I would eat a regular meal like before I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes my blood sugars were fine. Like today I had a baconator from Wendy's with fries and soda and when I took my reading two hours later it was 101 while I can eat a 1/4 cup of rice, chicken, and a whole can of greens beans and it will sometimes be over 120. It's strange so my doctors have kind of given me the red light to eat bigger meals that it know won't affect my blood sugars but still recommend that I take my insulin for dinner and the other insulin before bedtime. I feel like I have the strangest case of gestational diabetes. When you ladies did your glucose level test what we're your results? Mine was 190 after consuming 100th of pure sugar I believe.",

I have gestational diabetes so my diet is really strict and it's making me so mad because for the last couple days I've been soooo hungry even after I eat. And I swear if I have to eat one more piece of chicken because it's \"high in protein and good for me\" I'm gonna lose it, all I want is a giant bowl of Mac and cheese lol. Any other ladies going through this? What do I do to quit being so hungry? It's like food is all that's on my mind lol.",
