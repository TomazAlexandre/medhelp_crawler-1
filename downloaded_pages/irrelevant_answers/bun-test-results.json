            "answer": "Hi adezmom!\u00a0\u00a0I am a volunteer, not a medical professional, so any information passed on to you should be verified & discussed with your Father's healthcare team.I checked out a terrific website and found out some information that I believe you will find useful.\u00a0\u00a0Please refer to http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/analytes/bun/test.html for some answers to your question.I, thankfully, do not have any personal experience with this area of diabetes, but hope that others out there who do, will share their knowledge with you.From the information that you have stated, it looks like you are doing the right thing by inquiring further into what the results mean for your Dad.\u00a0\u00a0Have you posed this question to his endocrinologist?\u00a0\u00a0Has he been maintaining better control of his blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0It can be challenging, but better bg's mean better overall health.\u00a0\u00a0If you need help with that, please let us know and good luck with your Dad!",
