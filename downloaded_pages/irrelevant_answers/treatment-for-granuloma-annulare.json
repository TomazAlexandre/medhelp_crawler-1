    "question": "I have been diagnosed with Granuloma Annulare.\u00a0\u00a0I first noticed it as a couple of small lumps in my groin.\u00a0\u00a0It began to spread and become larger red lumps.\u00a0\u00a0My dermatologist did a biopsy of one of the sites which confirmed this diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0He prescribed Dexometasone cream twice daily which has done absolutely no good.\u00a0\u00a0The condition has spread all over the back and sided of both legs, from the knees up, down my sides, and on my back.\u00a0\u00a0When I sit my legs burn like fire.\u00a0\u00a0I have absolutely no energy.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, I too have a dog that I have had for 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0Not long after we got him I contracted a staph infection on my right leg--out of the blue--had to have surgery twice and was placed on a high-powered antibiotic.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if this could have been the start of the problem I am now having.This discussion is related to/posts/show/240138.",
