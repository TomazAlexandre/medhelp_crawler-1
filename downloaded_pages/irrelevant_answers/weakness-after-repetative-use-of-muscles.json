            "answer": "I would also be interested in knowing if you received a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I have had extreme muscle fatigue in my upper arms with minor use that started suddenly last year. This is just another symptom of an ongoing neuromuscular problem over the last 8 years. The only test that is positive is a muscle biopsy, but the doctors aren't sure what disease it is.Thank you.",

            "answer": "Hi,Is there weakness in a particular set of muscles or in general?This weakness could be a result of nutritional deficiency, fatigue, fibromyalgia, dehydration, hormonal disorder or lack of potassium to name a few. Please increase the intake of fluid and electrolytes and see if it makes you feel any better till you get to see your neurologist. Do keep us posted!",

            "answer": "For me I think I can rule out fibromyalgia as I am only 21. I eat all the time. Vegetables, fruits, including bananas (potassium)...nothing out of the ordinary so I can't see anything being wrong with my bodies nutrients. This is my 2nd month since I've stopped the pill...but I haven't heard much about muscle weakness/fatigue as a side-effect. For me it all started last month in June. I had a hot flash all of a sudden but no fever. The next day I had a dull ache in my stomach (or that area anyways not sure if it was my stomach) for about 5 days. This went away and after I was left with a new set of symptoms. My arms and legs would get tired more easily and I'd always feel the need to flex my muscles. Even when my legs would be idle and not moving I'd feel as though they felt very light and floaty like they wouldn't hold me up if I stood, but they do. They look fine and work fine but don't feel fine. I feel like my fingers tingle much more often that they used to along with my feet. Some days they feel weak, somedays they'll be more on the sore side like how you'd feel if you did a work out the day before. The other day it was the muscle right under my buttocks that was sore....I did nothing to bring this on. It's so strange I am at a loss of what it could be. Not diabetes, I dont have any other symptoms of being thirsty of urinating frequently. I'm thinking maybe thyroid...by I'm not overweight at all in fact I am 5'4 and 105 lbs even though I can eat like a horse. None of it is enough to be debilitating or noticeable to others but I can feel it and it bothers me. If anyone has insight let me know pleaaase i'd love to get an idea before I get it checked out (i never have time to book apts).",

    "question": "I am having problems with my muscular endurance.\u00a0\u00a0I can do anything once but if I do something as simple as hold a phone up to my ear for longer than five minutes my bicep gets weak and sore.\u00a0\u00a0It is a repetitive problem.\u00a0\u00a0I have been healthy all of my life and very active until about six months ago when this started.\u00a0\u00a0The problem comes and goes with varying degrees of fatigue, sometimes only the muscles used and sometimes my whole body gets fatigued.What possible problems can cause this?\u00a0\u00a0I am going to my neurologist friday and want to know what to ask him.\u00a0\u00a0I have had an EMG and MRI and both looked good.\u00a0\u00a0What should he test for?Thanks,",
