            "answer": "Dear MollyMc,Thank you so much for reaching out to this forum. It can be very hard to deal with a negative report on a possible complication, especially, when you have maintained good control. LRS had such a great comment. While I am a mom with a son with diabetes, who has a different complication, I know we have come along way with research. I do understand your frustration, but as LRS said, there is a big difference between kidney failure and possible damage. The website she suggested was very helpful to me. I have learned, through my son's comlications,that nothing is impossible. Knowledge is power and it seems you already know this. Please know that you are not alone and while I can't speak with more specific information on this particular issue, others will. Try to keep your chin up and please keep in contact.Best of Luck,dm",

            "answer": "Sorry, for my delay in getting a response to you, but I needed to do some research on this question as I said earlier that this was not an area of expertise for me.\u00a0\u00a0I put out some feelers to several people in the medical world and though they can't speak directly to your question about changing your dosages, they did offer this:\"Unfortunately, the reality re: Type 1 is that tight control does not protect everyone from complications -- it is, simply, the option we have to reduce risk.\u00a0\u00a0Other things we know/believe reduce risk include taking a baby aspirin per day, lowering cholesterol (including taking statin drugs), taking ACEinhibitors, and possibly taking supplements of thiamine (benfothiamine), Omega-3 fatty acids (fish oil), anti-oxidants (Vit E, beta carotene, etc). However, in those people most at risk -- because of genetic predisposition or other factors-- bad outcomes still happen, and they, tragically, happen young.\"It is our hope that others will come to the forum and offer additional insight into this all too real problem facing ALL type 1's.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for coming to the forum . . . we hope you'll return often to learn more as well as to share withall how you are doing.\u00a0\u00a0All the best!",

    "question": "I am 32 years old and have been a Type I diabetic for 17 years. I have been in really tight control for the last 6 years or more with hemaglobin A1c's ranging from 5.8 to 6.5. I have recently been spilling microalbumin in my urine.\u00a0\u00a0At my last three endocrinologist appointments my microalbumin levels have been 70, 50, and 53, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0Four months ago my endocrinologist put me on lisinopril 5mg for kidney protection.\u00a0\u00a0He would like to increase my dose but cannot because my blood pressure is borderline low as it is.\u00a0\u00a0I am really scared about what this all means for the future health of myself and my kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0I am interested in any information available abouth the long term implications of this (specifically, the time frame of progression), how commonly this occurs, can it reverse, and any other information/advice.\u00a0\u00a0I don't understand why this is happening now when I have been tightly controlled for this long.\u00a0\u00a0I thought tight control would slow progression or reverse and complications.\u00a0\u00a0I would greatly appreciate any information you have as well as any words of encouragement.Sincerely,MollyMc",
