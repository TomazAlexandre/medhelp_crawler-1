            "answer": "You didn't say what your sugar levels were that the doctor was responding to. Did he officially diagnose you as pre-diabetic? Diabetic? Yes, losing weight in addition to eating well and exercising can help control blood sugars in someone who is pre-diabetic. But in order to really know what is going on with you you need to test. I suggest buying a glucose meter and testing at least a couple times a week fasting and two hours after food. If you feel light headed and dizzy when you are almost due to eat it could be hypoglycemia which is part of diabetes.",

            "answer": "I'm also a bit curious why you are posting this in the Type 1 rather than Type 2 forum. Which type of diabetes did your doctor tell you you had? Type 2 can be controlled with diet, exercise and weight loss, at least for awhile. Type 1 cannot; you need insulin because you aren't producing enough yourself. Makes a big difference!",
