Sometimes the Lasix prescription is not enough and the person needs to be hospitalized for IV Lasix to get all the water off.\u00a0\u00a0Water buildup is dangerous, but dehydration is dangerous also and can be life threatening.\u00a0\u00a0You need to know the signs of dehydration.\u00a0\u00a0Wrinkled fingers, cherry red lips, white gums, dry gums.\u00a0\u00a0Does he also take potassium supplement?\u00a0\u00a0Potassium is needed for the heart to beat.\u00a0\u00a0Lasix removes Potassium and there needs to be a replacement of the Potassium lost.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that he does not put on a pound a day, which can mean water buildup.\u00a0\u00a0He should be weighing himself daily.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!You got some good advice from Encephalomalacia. Take your husband\u2019s weight daily to see if the weight is increasing. If he lies down for long periods, check the tail bone point for edema (dependent edema). The edema may not reach his ankles. If he is on laxis talk to the nutritionist about his diet plan. You can probably add a banana to his diet daily if he does not have diabetes or maybe an orange or alternate between banana and orange.Hope these tips help. If symptoms persist consult your cardiac specialist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My husband has had many things with his heart, currently on defibrillator #5 for VF.\u00a0\u00a0My question really is about the Lasix related to the water surrounding the heart.\u00a0\u00a0He says if his ankles and legs don't show water buildup he doesn't take the pills, but I'm wondering if this is the only way that water buildup around the heart can be detected, shouldn't he be taking the pills anyway? He has felt 'dry' at times and urinating excessive and felt to stop at times, please advise.. mamaj",
