            "answer": "How come these doctors didn't know that interferon can cause glucose spikes? ( I know of one other person who has presented with diabetes after only 2 or 3 weeks of shots.)\u00a0\u00a0Conversely, insulin resistance (fairly common in HCV patients) can impair rseponse to IFN and riba, so you definitely want to get this one under control.See <a href=http://www.natap.org/2005/HCV/033005__01.htm>Insulin Resistance Impairs Response to IFN/RBV</a>And here's a quote from the Projects in Knowledge/Education Initiative in Gastroenterology \"Care and Counsel II Side Effects Management Handbook\"\u00a0\u00a0(posted on the web):\"Acute treatment with interferon alfa results in an increase in counter-regulatory hormones as well as a hypermetabolic response, leading to insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0These effects are dose dependent and decrease over time.\"",

            "answer": "i developed diabetes with sugars ranging from 300-570 after becoming infected with hepatitis C at 38 years of age. I do have a family history of diabetes but not a strong one. There is enough evidence in the literature to strongly suggest that diabetes can develop after hep C infection alone and also with IFN treatment. The fact that your husband has been repeatedly hospitalized for DKA is a reflection of the care he has been receiving from his primary medical doctors. You may want his diabetes to be managed by a board-certified endocrinologist or diabetic specialist (somebody who is knowledgeable of all the cutting-edge research in diabetes). I am on the medtronic insulin pump which delivers insulin continuously rather than the traditional shots people get. I am certain that better control can be achieved with more intensive insulin therapy. Wish you and your husband the best.",

            "answer": "I developed insulin dependant diabetes either from Hep C and cirrhosis or the 3 Tx's I have been on, or both.I used to have a problem maitaining stability when I was just taking orals but got much better results when I went to full time insulin, although I did spaend a night in the hospital last week after going low (~10) and passing out. Nothing like waking up and being surronded by the FD EMT's! For many a 10 would mean a coma but I can tolerate the highs and lows fairly well. I was taken of glyburide and metformin and put on glipizide also.The biggest thing that has helped me with both the Hep C and diabetes (besides a good diet) is going to the gym every day and doing a good cardio workout of 45 minutes and 750 calories an an elliptical machine.I used to feel like crap and had NO energy and got winded so easily until I did. It took me awhile to get into it as the LAST thing I wanted to do was anythinh physical. Since I have been doing it for about two years now, I feel soooo much better than I had in such a long time. Anytime I miss more than a few days, I get to feeling crappy again. Besides feeling physically better, it has improved my mental outlook as well. I used to be prone to depression and the 'poor me' syndrome. That has greatly improved and people tell me I inspire them with my positive outlook on life given all the obstacles I am facing. I have dropped 60 pounds (260 to 200) and got back a lot of the muscle mass that was wasting away. I had an angiogram and and the pressures inside my heart measured two weeks ago as part of a liver pre-transplant workup and the cardiologist said my heart is in as good a shape as when I was born (hope it WAS good when I was born!) I don't need a transplant right now and am not listed but I am starting triple Tx in February and my Hepa is worried it could cause my liver to fail, so she is covering the bases beforehandDon't know if this would work for anyone else and like they say, talk to your doctor first, but I swear by my workout! My last HgA1c was 6.9 which is a little high, but not too bad. I also have varices and take propranolol to slow my heart rate so I can't work out as hard as I like.My other secret to a happy life is to get the paper every morning and check the obituaries and if I don't see my name there I know that it'll be a good day!!! Oh yeah, right after that, I turn it all over to God and know that He is the one really in charge.Good luck to you and your husband, Merry Christmas and keep up the good fight and have faith that between the two of you, you will get it worked out. He is sooo lucky to have you to help him!God bless,Chris",
