            "answer": "I don't want to scare you, but as soon as I read your post, my father came to mind! He had the very same problem. He had every test run on him from a stroke to lung cancer, but nothing! He started to get worse and worse. After a year went by, he was bed ridden, skin and bones, falling apart before my eyes! Finally, one day a doctor who actually knew what he was doing diagnosed my dad with lymphoma!! They were going to start chemo on him the next day, but he passed away that very day. He was in perfect health until his thumb went numb for no reason whatsoever! I just wanted you to be aware of the fact that if your doctor cannot find anything wrong with your nerves or muscles, please mention my story to him! Good luck, and God bless!",

            "answer": "That's an outrageous post above and you really should just ignore it.\u00a0\u00a0A numb thumb is merely pressure on a nerve - probably the ulnar - and it can be trapped somewhere in the arm (sometimes the elbow, sometimes further up).\u00a0\u00a0Physiotherapy and anti-inflammatories often do the trick - if not, a simple operation can free the nerve.Best of luck and do tell your GP that you would be happier to have the problem sorted out sooner rather than later.",

I am just trying to warn people that something as simple as a numb thumb may not be that simple, that is all. And I did say that chances are a numb thumb would not turn out to be cancer, but if I didn't post my father's story and it turned out that a numb thumb WAS cancer, then by God, I am glad that I posted my comments!",
