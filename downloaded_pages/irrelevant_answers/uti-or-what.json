            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Well, diabetes does delay healing and infection. Since your vagina is also swollen you can also be having some STD\u2014is there a possibility? Also along with antibiotic you would need things like apple cider and vitamin C to combat irritation and itching. Take the course\u00a0\u00a0for at least 5 days for full effect.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
