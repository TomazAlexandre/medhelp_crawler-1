    "question": "I am newly diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes. I used an old meter from Precision Neo and my numbers were around 130 no higher than 158. My endocrinologist gave me a One Touch and my numbers are at 174 all week. Mornings are 130 or 113. Either my new meter is more sensitive, or I'm struggling..I'm very thirsty and my fingers are numb. I've walked and I eat a good diet. I meet a nutritionist on Tuesday. I stick to a low carb and high protein diet. I do enjoy fresh fruit. Not excessive though. Not sure how to bring my sugar down.",
