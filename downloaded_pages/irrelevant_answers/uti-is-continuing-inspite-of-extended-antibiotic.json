            "answer": "Hello,Recurrent urine infections could be due to various reasons. Most common cause is stones in kidney which is blocking urine pathway. Other causes are changing sexual partners frequently, pregnancy, diabetes and of course childhood infections. The urine can also be due to retention of urine anywhere in its flow due to obstruction. The obstruction can be due to abnormality of structures since birth, stones or diseases like tumors. So you should get a ultrasound, CT scan done and also some urine and blood tests.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your detailed response. I have had ultrasound and CT scan, but nothinghas turned up in these tests which suggest UTI. Also, I am not sexually active.The urologist in California has suggested that the only other option is to do a scope test,which I am hesitating since it involves sending a tube with camera through the penis.The urologist himself seems baffled.For me, the UTI is not severe, no pains, but I am affraid that it might just reappear in a bad way.",
