            "answer": "\"Do you know if there is any coorelation between high platelets and axillary adenopathy???\"Not that I'm aware of. Honestly.... I think you need a second opinion from another physician and espeically since you are still having symptoms ! I can tell you that increased platelets are seen sometimes in people who have acute infections, cancer, splenectomy (still have your spleen?), polycythemia vera, myeloproliferative disorders, chronic inflammation (RA, etc) and chronic granulocytic or myelogenous leukemia.",
