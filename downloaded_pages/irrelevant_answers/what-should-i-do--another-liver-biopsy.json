            "answer": "Yeah, get another biopsy...It will give you an understanding of whats going on inside your body.As far as ALT's, now sure why your Dr would stop treatment because he said it was not lowering them. I went 48 of tx without my ALT's ever normalizing or lowering. Mine actually elevated right when I went on tx, and remained that way until I discontinued tx. The meds themselves caused the elevation, and the rise in ALT's.. I am 10 months post tx now, and SVR..I'd ask for biopsy, genotype, and definately viral load.. Find out where you are right now, so you know how to proceed in the future...",

            "answer": "Hi there, I agree with the others. You definatly need a new biopsy. You just never know the stage your liver is in, until you have the biopsy. My liver enzymes were alt52 and ast38. I never had liver pains or any symptoms. I am a 42 yr female and I found out I have cirrhosis. I say this not to scare you but so that you understand the importance of the biopsy. I would have never known cause I felt wonderful.Good luck and God Bless",
