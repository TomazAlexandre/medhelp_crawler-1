            "answer": "Hi.Numbness in this area of the body may be explained by problems with the nerves, or problems with the blood supply or circulation.\u00a0\u00a0While these are more common in patients with diabetes or other metabolic disorders, it can happen to every one.Tests to determine nerve status would include NCV (nerve conduction velocity), and the blood supply can be tested using angiograms or doppler studies.I suggest that these options be discussed with her doctors.Regards and God bless.",
