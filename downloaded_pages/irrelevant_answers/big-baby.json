            "answer": "My daughter was 8lb9oz at 40+6 and my son was measuring 6lb3oz at 34 weeks and measuring 9lb as of yesterday at 40+2. My doc is still fine with having a vaginal delivery. Ultrasounds can be off as well, so I would go ahead with a vaginal delivery anyway and take your chances. I had a friend told at 36 weeks her baby was 6lbs and 4 weeks later she was born at just over 6lbs so there's no way she didn't gain much weight the last few weeks. If you're really worried just try to avoid sugar and lots of carbs, eat healthy, and stay as active as possible. You can get the doctor to induce early too rather than get a c section. Lots of options.",

            "answer": "My biggest baby was 9lbs 14.7ozs and he was induced 3 wks early with no gestational diabetes. He was in NICU for one week which is protocol for babys of his weight. They suspected he may have diabetes but it was negative. This time around my Dr is recommending a c section. He feels this baby may even be larger then him. Which this is baby nmbr 7 and last baby, and after reading the risks of naturally birthing a larger baby, I have decided to go ahead with the c section because I will also be getting a tubal. I will b having my babygirl July 7th at 9:30am. I would definitely weigh out the risk of natural birth vs c section. My niece was born weighing 8lbs 8ozs and her left shoulder was dislocated from her collar bone and it has caused permanent damage and she has to get physical therapy. Good luck to ypu and your baby. On a side note, my lil fat boy was very large but definitely the easiest baby by far. Very happy, healthy and so adorable.",

    "question": "so I've been to docs several times n each time I'm being told he gonna be big. I'm being monitored by 2 diff doc at diff offices. Each time I get a sono the tech asks how much was ur biggest baby? I've passed my sugar test also.. I just went to doc yesterday I'm 33w tomorrow and he is almost 6pds. They r sendn me on the 7th to get the nst test done that monitors his movements which he moves all the time. My reg OB says if I wait till due date of 8/19 he might be too big to pass thru n I might need emergency c-section which I don't want. She has his head n belly measures 35w. I also go for a consult on the 11th to discuss inducing me and when. I asked doc what she think his weight would be and she said min 9pds or more if I go til due date smh. Im trying to stay calm but idk what I shld do all my other kids were natural n I want this to be too. My biggest was 8pd 2oz with np. Could they weight be wrong??? Anyone else going thru this?",
