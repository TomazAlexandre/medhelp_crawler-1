            "answer": "Firstly, do have sympathy because I can tell you from experience that bypass surgery isvery painful. In fact, when I woke from the surgery my first thoughts were \"what have I done, I can't handle this pain\".After about a week the pain lessens a lot but still hurts like mad to move the upper part of the body. I had pains turning over in my sleep for the first year and the pains were enough to wake me up, sometimes with a loud cracking sound.Lots of strange sensations will be felt during healing, including some stabbing pains which lead a patient to believe they are having heart problems again. It is simply the nerves in the chest knitting back together.The most important activity to begin with is breathing exercises. Simply breathing in as far as one can, then holding it for about 4 seconds before exhaling. This has to be repeated about once an hour to get the chest/lungs stretching.",
