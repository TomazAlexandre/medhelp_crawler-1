            "answer": "Dear Molly,The major identified risk factors for occlusive coronary artery disease (CAD)are: increasing age, male sex, hypertension, smoking, diabetes, family history of CAD and high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0As the number of risk factors an individual has increases so does their risk for developing CAD.\u00a0\u00a0However, these risk factors do not identify everyone and there are many people who will develop CAD who do not have any known risk factors.The risk for reoccurence in individuals with CAD is high but can be reduced with proper management.\u00a0\u00a0Once an individual does have coronary stenosis it should be managed as a \"full-blown\" case with appropriate diet, exercise and medications.\u00a0\u00a0 Many people go on to lead healthy and happy lives after the diagnosis of CAD has been made.",

            "answer": "I had the exact same problem 3 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was shocked when the Doctor told me I had premature CAD (after the cath) - I also had a perfect history including passing a stress test and a thalium scan and no buildup in my arteries.When he did the cath, he was shocked to find a 95% occlusion in my LAD (also known as the \"widow-maker!)\u00a0\u00a0I did not suffer any heart damage fortunately but I did have several bouts with re-stenosis.What symptoms did you have?\u00a0\u00a0Does your Doctor have you on any meds?\u00a0\u00a0The only thing I take is a very low dose of Zocor.\u00a0\u00a0My numbers were always very good, etc. etc.Hang in there and just consider yourself normal - I think the whole episode was just a weird happening which I hope never repeats itself!",

    "question": "I am a 48 yr old perimenopausal female who recently underwent a cardiac cath & stent placement for a 95% occluded proximal LAD.\u00a0\u00a0I have no immediate family history of cardiac problems & the cath showed no other signs of coronary artery disease.\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist was unable to tell me why this lesion occurred but is treating me as if I had full-blown CAD.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any theories as to why this happened & what my chances are for a reoccurrence somewhere else?",
