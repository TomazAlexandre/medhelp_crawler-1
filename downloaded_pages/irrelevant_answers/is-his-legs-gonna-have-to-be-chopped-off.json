            "answer": "The redness and swelling is from poor circulation. The doc would have a better handle on whether or not his legs will get cut off. This would be a last resort--they would try to increase the circulation to that area first. It is important that your father is seen by his doc on a regular basis and that he addresses the swelling and redness. This can also be helped by medication and if the problems are kept in check, he would not have to lose a limb.",
