            "answer": "Thank you very much for posting this.\u00a0\u00a0I found it incredibly helpful.There were some very do-able suggestions in the article, to lower insulin resistance.Here is one part I found especially helpful and easy to do:\" In particular, a late evening snack is reported not only to improve glucose intolerance[81-84], but also to suppress hepa\u00adtocar\u00adcinogenesis in cirrhotic patients[85].\"Taking a zinc supplement and getting some Branch chain amino acids in a whey protein shake has often been repeated as helpful to cirrhotics and this article is saying it helps fight insulin resistance.Coffee consumption was also mentioned as helpful for fasting glucose numbers.It also explained that insulin resistance can start showing up rather early in the HCV process, not necessarily just appropriate for later stages.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to be the virus itself causing the insulin resistance not just an inherited tendency towards diabetes.Every little bit surely helps and many of these suggestions are cheap and easy to implement. There is so much with this disease that feels out of your control that I find it exciting to find some controllable factors.Thanks again,Ev",
