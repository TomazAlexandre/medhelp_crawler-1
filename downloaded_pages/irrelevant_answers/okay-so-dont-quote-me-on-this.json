            "answer": "It certainly couldn't hurt to get tested for diabetes due to your symptoms. Do you have it in your family? It could, by the way, be Type 1 or it could be Type 2 which has become more common in young people. Actually frequent vaginal infections is another of the (lesser known) symptoms of diabetes. So I think it's great you are looking into it and willing to ask your doctor to do a test! It's always better to know if you have something and diabetes can be managed. If you don't have it, then you know that too! Let us know what happens.",

            "answer": "I'm going to the doctors tomorrow (Or very soon) and they're gonna check it all out. If I don't have it (fingers crossed? :D) that will be very pleasing to know, but if I do I think, because of an assignment I had to do once has made me more aware of what happens with diabetes and things such as that, I'm not going to be shock-horror scare athough it could be a bit of\u00a0\u00a0moment like that. I'll comment back soon letting you know whether or not it is or if it is something else :)",

    "question": "IF I have diabetes (I haven't been tested/diagnosed) I thought to put it here, I'm 13 so it may be juvenile. So recently I have had a large urge to drink (and urinate because of the drinks) but my eating habits have changed dramatically. I eat alot less now (I'm partly thankful) and I'm usually just thirsty. I have studied a bit about Diabetes and know a bit of the basic things you need to know and that go me curious... I'm a bit chubby and currently around 1.6m tall. And these weird drinking/eating changes have worried me, currently I am not involved in much phsical things (But I am considering joining the Air Force Cadets). I also have had some slow heaing wounds (May be irrelevent), I have experienced nausea, drowsiness/tiredness, fatigue, dizziness quite frequently. Also I have had a really itchy vagina. My mum bought me some cream and it started to work but now isn't effective. So she got me a different type of cream (fingers crossed this one works). Back to the point. Should I be as concerned as I am? Do you think it is something to consider, or do you just think I'm head-over-heels at the moment.Also the new cream says under \"Seek medical advice before using if: You are diabetic...\" and a few more. :SThanks for your time :) If you have any similar experiences like mine please leave a comment even if you haven't it would be a little help for me<3",
