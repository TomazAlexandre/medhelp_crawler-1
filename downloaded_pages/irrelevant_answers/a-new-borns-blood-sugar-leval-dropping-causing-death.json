            "answer": "As a type 1 diabetic mom, I know that even though poor diabetic control can harm a developing baby, the mother's glucose reading and the baby's glucose reading are two separate entities entirely. The baby has his own circulatory system and his own glucose regulatory system. So if the baby had a dangerously low sugar level, this would probably not have anything to do with the mother's sugar levels.",

            "answer": "My DW has been diagnosed with GD about a month ago.She is taking insulin shots to keep sugar low.Here is what we learned about sugar and its effect on mom and baby.How do high blood sugar levels cause problems? When extra sugar is in your blood, the baby is \"fed\" extra sugar, too. All this excess sugar can make the baby too big and fat. Delivery of big babies is harder on mom and baby.Because your baby is getting extra sugar, your baby's pancreas makes extra insulin. After birth, it's hard for the baby to stop putting out extra insulin. The baby must be watched over and treated if the blood sugar level drops too low.There is wealth of information on net. Above para are from www.diabetes.org and is in sync with what our Dr. told us.Hope this helps.",
