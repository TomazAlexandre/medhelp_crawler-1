I would mention the thirst to your Doc, they may want to add a fasting blood sugar to your initial blood work since you'll be going for blood anyway.

I also had dark urine the whole time with #2. Well, turns out a lot of women expecting twins experience those symptoms!! Maybe post that question in the multiples forum for fun??? I never had them while pregnant with my dd. I didn't have GD with either pregnancy either. Hmmm. Not saying this is a diagnosis so please don't skewer me anyone reading this! It still could be something else though or just pregnancy in general. Don't worry, the OB checks your urine more than you ever thought possible LOL!Congrats again Amanda!~t",
