            "answer": "Hello, considering the majority of your tests have came back in normal range, I would try not to worry for now as Stress/Anxiety can alter your perception and make things worse. Take it easy until you have more tests done. If everything is inconclusive, maybe a full body MRI will ease your mind. Hope this helps, best regards.",

    "question": "Hi there,My name's Ciro and I'm 22 years old. I've been feeling very sick lately. However, despite the fact that everything seem in the parameters, (except for a high blood pressure: 159/90) that didn't change my status. I'll try to explain as clear as possible all of my symptoms. I feel extrem body heat, I've been urinating quite a lot recently(even though, that could be casued by the drinking lots of water!) sometimes I feel weak (and that makes me think of some kind of Diabetes) and everytime after I eat (exactly in digestion time) my head starts to hurt very much. I'm going to be very honest here, I've been feeling down and demotivated over the past three months, and of course, really stressed out! I'm going thruought the USCIS process, and I've completely changed my life after I got married. I can't hide that we've been throught a lot of problems, and we still are in a lot of problems. So between my wife's depression, and all the problems surrounding me, I think I felt defeated. However, I don't feel claiming that my sickness belongs from my stress and problems, (altough it could be, since I'm not an expert) I strongly believe that there's something wrong inside me. I've been running tests over tests (like Siphilis, HIV and all the possible diseases belonging from sex or blood), however, nothing came out. I do have all of my vaccinations and shots, and I do a lot of sports and exercise. (still a little overweight, even though one couldn't tell) This Wednesday I have an appointment to run some other tests like; Glucouse, Hemoglobin, and a Wellness profile, that checks your Cholesterol, and Kidney & Liver function. However, if nothing pops out, I'll still be walking into the dark, please somebody helps me to understand.",
