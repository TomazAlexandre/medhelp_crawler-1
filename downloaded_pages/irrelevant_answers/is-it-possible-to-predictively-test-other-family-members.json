            "answer": "i am not a doctor but if i were i might know more about this. But i've never heard of any predictive test for diabetes. If there is any it would be a regular blood sugar test and might only help predict if the test were performed right before the symptoms would have started on their own. Because the symptoms of Type 1 don't start showing until at least 80% of the beta cells that make insulin have been destroyed.It would certainly be nice if there were a test to predict that diabetes was making it's move. Part of the problem i see is that during the last twenty years they have made some awesome strides in diabetes care, many that were nonexistant when i first became diabetic over thirty years ago. And i think with the big moves forward in the care we are starting to feel that they should also be making moves on predicting diabetes getting closer to a cure. Well, i'm not trying to pessimistic but i think that research in these two areas is still a long ways off from fruition.But as a long time diabetic, i'd give almost anything for a cure. What an extraordinary feeling that would be to go to the corner store and buy a Hershey Chocolate bar and eat it and not feel guilty about it.But i think they are trying to see if there may be somethings that might signal impending diabetes. This would be beneficial to a way they are already using with newly diagnosed diabetics, by controlling their diet and use of insulin, they are trying to get what few Bete cells that may be left might be kept alive longer through means like that and give the body it's\u00a0\u00a0normal control longer. This is why every research house going has their own areas of study and may help bring relief in different forms than are available now.i must stop or else i'll write you a novel and you'll only read it when you need to get to sleep.never stop looking forward, bret",

            "answer": "Have you had your son tested for the GAD antibodies? If he tests positive, there is a good chance that he will become T1. There is not much you can do about it. But you will have been forwarned. A lot of work is being done on preserving beta cells. And the sooner you know they are under attack, the better you will be able to respond.In answer to your second question, the Americans test blood sugar in milligrams per 100 mls. 1 mmol/l is equal to 18 ml/dl.Cheers,Mark",

            "answer": "This article deals with predicting T1 Diabets :http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/3/623This is an excerpt :\"The authors conclude that teens with at least two de fined autoantibodies, i.e., antibodies to insulin, the 65-kDa isoform of GAD, and/or to the protein tyrosine phosphatase-related IA-2/islet cell autoantibody (ICA)-512 molecule, are characterized by a high risk of progression to overt diabetes, and that a screening strategy based on the analysis of insulin autoantibodies and GAD and IA-2 antibodies is highly successful in the assessment of type 1 diabetes risk in adolescents.\"Testing positive for the antibodies appears to be a strong predictor for the onset of T1, especially whre an immediate-family members already has it. And the sooner intervention can be started, the more successful preservation of beta cells is likely to be.It is of interest to me as I have T1 and my 17 year old daughter was diagnosed with it a month ago. We also have a 19 year old daughter. It would be good to know if she is also at risk. But she is a bit freaked out at the moment and is refusing to have the antibody tests done ...Cheers,Mark",

    "question": "I have noticed on this forum that some people have commented that they have had family members pre tested for Type 1.My son is 3rd generation Type 1 (his father and grandfather and uncle are also type 1).\u00a0\u00a0He is now 10 (diagnosed at 7).\u00a0\u00a0I have a son who is now 11 who so far is clear from diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I test his blood sugar every few weeks or if he's ill, but I would like to know whether there is a test that will tell us whether he is likely to become diabetic.We are taking part in various genetic studies here in the UK, but nobody has mentioned a predictive test to us.Any info would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0And if anyone could explain the difference in blood sugar readings between the Uk and US, it would help me and others understand some of the postings.\u00a0\u00a0In the Uk we measure in mmol, so a good sugar reading would be between 4 and 6, and a high one over 10.",
