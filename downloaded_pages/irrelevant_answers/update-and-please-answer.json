You might post on the Forum where questions are answered by the Cleveland Clinic Physicians. Whether your Grandmother chooses to have treatment or not is entirely up to her. She should discuss any concerns about her treatment in depth with her Oncologist.",

    "question": "Hello,I am very thankful for this site and have learned alot.\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother was diagnosed with Invasive Ductal Carcinoma in Nov 07.\u00a0\u00a0They removed the lump and it had clear margins, but was Grade 3 Nuclear grade 8.\u00a0\u00a0They said at that time it was Stage 1, no lymph node involvement and no Metastatic.well she decided not to do any further treatments after having the lump removed. She was afraid to lose her hair with any treatment.In April of 08 she discovered a lump under her arm, and last week had it removed, and the week before that a PET was done.the lump came back as being Metastatic Carcinoma, the PET scan showed the following results...2.4 x 1.2 cm soft tissue mass in left axilla/left chest wall with mean and maximum metabolic activities.this most likely represents metastatic malignancy.Increased glucose metabolism within bilateral humeral heads as well as in the cervical, thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine and in the sternum.\u00a0\u00a0Bony metastases can present within this appearance.Small focus of increased glucose metabolism along the inferomedial margin of the left kidney most likely in the left adrenal gland.. This focus represents mean and maximal metabolic activities of approximately 2.5 and 11.5 SUV, respectively.\u00a0\u00a0Metastatic malignancy in this location could present with this appearance.What exactly does this all mean? And they are wanting to treat her (if she will) with Tykerb and or Xeloda.I have read about Xeloda and am really nervous as she has a heart condition, diabetes, she is on blood thinner warafin, and she is Polythycemia Vera. (Not sure of the spelling).What stage would she be in? And if she chooses not to have treatments can she live years and years without it? Or do you think as I do she will not survive till the end of the year?Thank You for your responses.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/292005\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/292005</a>.",
