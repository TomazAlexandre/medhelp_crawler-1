Test your BG 1 hour after eating that will tell you how your body handles carbohydrates.\u00a0\u00a0Its carbohydrates (carbs) that raise BG not fat.\u00a0\u00a0some of your symptoms sound like neropathy.\u00a0\u00a0if you can reduce your carbs till your BG stays under 140. if you cant do that then you may need more drugs.Metforman takes 6 to 8 weeks to build up in your system, it does NOT work as you think where you take it at meals for the meal.\u00a0\u00a0You take it at meals so you take it with food.",

            "answer": "First of all, calm down.\u00a0\u00a0Worrying sick over the symptoms you mentioned does NOT help anything.\u00a0\u00a0Stress only causes problems.\u00a0\u00a0You can do this...calm down. Take this experience as a lesson learned.\u00a0\u00a0You cannot take a vacation from diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You must watch what you eat at all times.\u00a0\u00a0Or else, you will pay for it.Your message provides some possible clues of what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0First, you said you were able to maintain good blood sugar numbers, but then ate whatever for 3 months, and then things went haywire.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like your body produced a great deal of inflammation and diabetic symptoms during the 3 months of abuse, and now you are paying for it.\u00a0\u00a0Don't think you can reverse the damage over a day or two.\u00a0\u00a0Give your body a couple of weeks at least show signs of recovery.\u00a0\u00a0 You admittedly stated that you abused it for 3 months...so I really don't think ALS is your problem.\u00a0\u00a0It is more likely your body is recovering from the abuse, making the diabetic condition worse.Pay attention to what Diabetes86 wrote.\u00a0\u00a0It's the carbohydrates that cause problems in your diabetes diet.\u00a0\u00a0Eating low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet will give you a really good fighting chance to get back to better health relatively quickly. Google LCHF diet, and you will find sufficient doctors and other resources behind what you should be eating, and if you happen to be vegetarian, there is also versions of LCHF diet to accommodate this. It doesn't make sense for one with diabetes to consume carbohydrate, and then take medication to reduce the impact of the ingested carbo.\u00a0\u00a0So, the logical conclusion is don't eat the carbo to begin with.So...in conclusion....calm down.\u00a0\u00a0The abuse your body experienced is likely reacting to it now.\u00a0\u00a0Get your diet set right to help your body recover quickly.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugar is out of control from the abuse, it rises and dives, and you can experience things like the shakes (low blood sugar periods), and during the cyclical period, you can experience high thirst and hunger, too.\u00a0\u00a0Eat LCHF to help get it under control.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",
