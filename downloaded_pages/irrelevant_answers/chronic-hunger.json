            "answer": "First of all I should identify the fact that I'm not a certified nutritionist but a 65-yr-old woman from a fat family who has had to watch herself forever in order not to get type 2 diabetes like my siblings and deceased parents--I should say, all but one of my siblings and he's Down Syndrome and lives in a facility where his food is prepared for him and monitored.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 5'8 and 160 pounds, and I have to really work at keeping it there.\u00a0\u00a0 I've done it at various times with TOPS, Weight Watchers and Nutrisystem (no, I'm not a shill.)\u00a0\u00a0All these programs give you suggestions, like using a smaller plate, not keeping junk in the house (I'm religious about that), etc. etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard them all.\u00a0\u00a0To make matters worse, my husband is slender, though almost to my delight he's growing a pot!Here's my take:\u00a0\u00a0when you started starving yourself down to 600 calories, your body rebelled.\u00a0\u00a0It wanted and needed more food.\u00a0\u00a0It's like your body is making up for what it missed and more, almost like a teenager who's been kept too restricted and now she's at college and going nuts.The teen, and your body, need at least some discipline.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe a return to a few weeks of Weight Watchers wouldn't be too bad, just to get back on track.\u00a0\u00a0Eating the nuts (or a spoonful of peanut butter) a half hour before meals is an excellent suggestion.\u00a0\u00a0Also, cut out the diet soda.\u00a0\u00a0Diet soda can actually kick up your appetite.\u00a0\u00a0What I've found helpful is to have a midmorning and midafternoon snack of either a cup of warm skim milk or lite vanilla soy with either a teaspoon of decaf or Postum (not as gross as it may sound after you sprinkle cinnamon and add a little artificual sweetener) or a non-fat yoghurt smoothie with frozen berries (no sugar).\u00a0\u00a0 At night I have a apple while I watch TV.\u00a0\u00a0It's funny how after awhile your body starts to crave the apple!\u00a0\u00a0And I used to crave a beer!All those things help, but the bottom line is always control.\u00a0\u00a0 Nobody wants to admit it, but I've learned it though hard experience.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I'm out of control and gain 5 or 10 pounds and believe me, it takes lots of will power to walk by the scores of delicious places to buy food in my neighborhood (I live in downtown Chicago and you should SEE what's walking distance from my house!)\u00a0\u00a0But I want knees that don't hurt, the ability to go on a hike without huffing and puffing, and above all.............no diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You can do it!",

            "answer": "It is great that you lost 150lbs and you were trying to lose more. You need to eat sufficient amount of calories for your body to maintain itself and it is recommend never going below 1200 calories. Below 1200 runs the risk of having malnutrition. From the weight you stated, you seem to need to loss more weight. I suggest you go back to Weight Watchers where you will have a support group and eat healthy. Set small weight goals (1/2lb \u2013 1lb a week) and loss the weight slowly. The slower you loss the weight, easier it is to maintain the lost weight, and adapt to the new healthy life change. You can do it. You did it before with much success and you can do it again. Best of luck.",

    "question": "I have lost a total of 150 lbs since July of 2005 on Weight Watchers.\u00a0\u00a0While trying to lose the last 30 lbs, I began to develop dangerous eating habits including limiting my caloric intake to around 600 calories a day.\u00a0\u00a0I ran 5 miles every day, 7 days a week.\u00a0\u00a0I was starving myself.\u00a0\u00a0But when I got to my goal weight, I then began binging uncontrolibly and sought therapy for exercise bulimia/anorexia.\u00a0\u00a0I have since left Weight Watchers and am tying to heal my metoblism by listening to hunger cues: eating when I'm hungry and stopping when I am full.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is that I am CONSTANTLY HUNGRY.\u00a0\u00a0I feel hunger, in my stomach, all the time, even after I eat (about 10 min. later).\u00a0\u00a0I have gained bacy 30 lbs of the 150 I lost.\u00a0\u00a0Someone please tell me I am not crazy.\u00a0\u00a0The binges have ceased. I still work out (mostly cardio) for 1-2 hrs, 5 days a week.",
