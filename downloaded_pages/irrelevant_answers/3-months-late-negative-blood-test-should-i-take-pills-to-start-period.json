            "answer": "The progesterone is fine. I'm 9 weeks now and when I was 6 weeks I was given progesterone to insert and to take orally to ensure that the embryo stayed put. So that's ok. Hope you get the sonogram done soon. That can clear the air on whether you're pregnant or not. You will definitely see the fetus at 3 months if you're pregnant. Good luck.",

    "question": "1). I have NEVER had an irregular period2). I have no cysts - I was just checked in March3). Abnormal EKG - had one 2 years ago that was normal & have been vegetarian since -- doubt there is anything wrong. I have read that some women have an abnormal EKG while pregnant.4). Abnormal Pap Smear - Waiting for testing on this issue, but OBGYN said 90% of the time it is HPV, but it does not stop your period. I have heard that some women have an abnormal pap if they are pregnant.5). Blood test to check for hormone imbalances, thyroid, diabetes, and everything under the sun -- all negative.7). I am now allergic to milk-- I have never had a problem with milk in my diet till now.6). Progesterone-- Dr. says it is okay to take this medicine even if I may by pregnant, but says right on the bottle to not take it if you may be pregnant.Should I take these pills or not?? I called the doctor and told her I would not take this pills until I know for sure that I am not pregnant. I want an ultrasound first before I begin taking these pills. My sister did not know she was pregnant until 6 months. I am at a loss at this point. Any advice???I have read that some women do not test with blood or urine test at all and I am worried that if I take these it may cause a birth defect if I do. Doctors seem to look at women as if we all fit into this one bubble and you do not receive individual care.",
