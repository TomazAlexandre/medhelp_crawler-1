            "answer": "Your doctor would suspect Hashimoto's thyroiditis even with negative antibody levels as you have type 1 diabetes. And since you have high vitamin B12 serum another suspect is autoimmune pernicious anaemia (see study below on this*). This may nor may not be the case but it is something to consider since these autoimmune diseases are genetically linked. I found an article on causes of reverse T3 and insulin dependant diabetes is a listed cause of elevated RT3.***\"Most patients with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis have measurable antibodies in the blood, with ~90% of patients having positive TPO antibodies and ~50% of patients having positive thyroglobulin antibodies. About 5 % of patients with a diagnosis of Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis based on clinical grounds or by ultrasound appearance have no measurable thyroid antibodies.\" - Patients with Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis and negative thyroid antibodies have a milder form of the disease - Clinical Thyroidology for the Public > Vol 7 Issue 9 > Vol 7 Issue 9 p.10-11***\"Other causes of reverse T3 dominance include: leptin resistance, inflammation (NF kappa-B), dieting, nutrient difficiencies such as low iron, selenium, zinc, chromium, Vit B6 and B12, Vit D and iodine, Low testosterone, low human growth hormone, Insulin dependent Diabetes, Pain, Stress, environmental toxins, Free radical load, Hemorrhagic shock, Liver disease, Kidney disease, Severe or systemic illness, severe injury, Surgery, Toxic metal exposure.\" - Custom Medicine - Reverse T3 Dominance***The following info is from the book \"The Everything Guide To Thyroid Disease\" by Theodore C. Friedman, MD, PhD and Winnie Yu Scherer:\"Although the majority of people with Hashimoto's will not develop any other disorders, it's important to know what some of these autoimmune conditions are in case you do start to experience symptoms. Keep in mind, too, that you may be more likely to develop Hashimoto's if you have one of these other conditions.Type 1 diabetesPernicious AnaemiaAddison's DiseaseVitiligoCeliac DiseaseAlopecia AretaSystematic Lupus Erthematosus (SLE)Rheumatoid ArthritisSjogren's SyndromeInflammatory Bowel DiseaseMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\"****Excerpt from The New England Journal Of Medicine - Spurious Elevations of Vitamin B12 with Pernicious Anemia:\"Within a 3-week period, two women, 46 and 48 years of age, presented with peripheral neuropathy and associated pancytopenia with macrocytic anemia. Clinical suspicion for pernicious anemia was high, but vitamin B12 levels were 1644 pg per milliliter (1228 pmol per liter) and 1321 pg per milliliter (975 pmol per liter), respectively (reference range, 246 to 1320 pg per milliliter [181 to 974 pmol per liter]).On subsequent bone-marrow evaluation, specimens from both patients showed profound megaloblastic features. Additional findings on laboratory tests included elevated levels of homocysteine and methylmalonic acid combined with detection of intrinsic factor\u2013blocking antibodies and antiparietal-cell antibodies, which further supported the diagnosis of pernicious anemia.\"***This is my info I found online from various sources that I put together...Increased vitamin B12 serum may be due to:* Supplementing with vitamin B12/high dietary intake of vitamin B12* Active (functional) vitamin B12 deficiency* MTHFR genetic defect* Polycythaemia Rubra Vera* Leukaemia:- Chronic myelogenous leukaemia aka chronic granulocytic leukaemia- Acute myeloblastic leukaemia- Acute promyelocytic leukaemia* Hypereosinophilic syndrome* Myelosclerosis* Carcinomatosis* Liver disease:- Acute hepatitis- Cirrhosis- Chronic liver disease- Hepatic coma* Non-leukaemic leucocytosis* Chloral Hydrate",

I'm wondering what my next steps should be. I would love some guidance.More info that might be helpful:1. Was supplementing with a multi B and B 12 vitamin. Have cut that back since high B12 result;2.. Have an appt with an integrative Dr (instead of my regular endo), to address thyroid, as I'm concerned over endo's handling of thyroid. Since last result, cut my Tirosint to 75 (since I had some left over from before Dr. increased me to 88 a long time ago);3. Diet/lifestyle is healthy: exercise, don't drink, eat real unprocessed foods, and due to T1 diabetes--low carb. (I did read that low carbing can cause lower T3, but not sure of extent.) Prior to T! diagnosis, was a bit underweight (5'5\" at 104lb). With insulin I've climbed to 112.Thank you!",

No?My endo sent me an email ( in response to my latest labs) which said: \"take the Cytomel\". There was no further instruction. I'm not comfortable with that. And at this point I'm now questioning whether I need any thyroid med at all. The labs from 2012 and most recent do NOT show elevated hashimotos antibodies.Red Star and Barb135: Thank you both for responses and for the info and sources. (I will look for that video.)My experience with T1 and low carbing does allow me to take a lesser amount of insulin, particularly meal time bolus. I feel safer operating this way, as I have found it difficult to consistently correctly cover meal time carbs. Even with the identical meal on two different days, and the identical amount of insulin, I can have pretty different results, depending on factors i do know about--such as exercise, and factors only my body knows about!",

As this progresses, you may have some hypo symptoms you notice along the way, but they should subside as your body readjusts.\u00a0\u00a0If symptoms should become intolerable, I would go in and test everything at that time.\u00a0\u00a0If everything goes okay, then in about 4 weeks with no thyroid med, it would be good to re-test everything and determine your new levels.",

This is what I needed to hear & where I was headed--slowly lessening the Tirosint over time to see if my thyroid can rebound and function independently without meds.I have decided to find a new endo, and am kicking myself for not doing more research when he first prescribed thyroid meds. In hindsight, I guess I just accepted his advice, thinking that because of my autoimmunity diabetes I probably had autoimmune hashi's as well.Today REALLY confirmed the need for me to lose him as my Dr.! Here's the story:\u00a0\u00a0I had recently sent him a message informing him that I had (on my own) lowered my dose of Tirosint from 88 to 75 given my recent results. As I said in an earlier post, he wrote back: \"take the cytomel\". Then today, I got a call from his office nurse that he had called me in a prescription for and wants me to take the cytomel 5 and Tirosint 112! What??!! Why would he UP my T4 med to 112??Needless to say, I will not be following this advice..I'm so thankful for this community, as I was feeling so confused about direction.Are you familiar with best protocol for attempting to wean off of thyroid meds? Would love your opinion as to:1. How long to stay on current Tirosint 75 (decreased from 88) before making another decrease; and2. Amount by which to decrease per each adjustmentI do realize that I may not feel great during the adjustment periods, but am at least willing to give my natural thyroid a shot and just react according to how it (labs + feeling) plays out.Thank you again, and any help on weaning protocol would be very appreciated!",
