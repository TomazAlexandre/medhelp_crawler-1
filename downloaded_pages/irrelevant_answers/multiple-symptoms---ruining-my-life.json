    "question": "I have all these symptoms that come on like an attack (some are always present now) it has been getting graduall worse for the last year. The one thing that makes them come on very strong is exercise. I have fallen down before shaking on the floor after exercise.1. Ringing in my ears (that's putting it lightly, it's more like screeching so loud I can barely hear anything else)2. Sharp chest pains - can be on right or left side3. Pains moving around my extremeties (arms, legs)4. sensations like electrical shocks in my feet5. My lips, feet and tongue go numb6. Nausea7. Dizziness8. Vision blurs and darkens9. weird chemical taste in my mouth10. Headaches11. Rapid heart rate12. Trouble breathingEKG, eeg, stress test, mri, xrays, and cat scan all showed nothing.Doctors say it's probably anxiety.anxiety meds do nothing for me.The ringing in my ears is always there. It is the one constant thing. These attacks I get on a daily basis now, they usually last 6 hours or longer.I'm having a hard time believing it is just anxiety.I have COPD and type 2 diabetes.Looking for suggestions on things to check that are not anxiety related.",
