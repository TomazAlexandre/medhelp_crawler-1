            "answer": "Hello,Loss of libido is very commonly found in women and mostly the cause is psychological in nature. It can be due to stress and anxiety or relationship problems with your partner. Talk to your husband for the psychological support. If you are having any stress, then this psychological support will help. A healthy affectionate communication with the partner helps in decreasing anxiety and stress.However if there is no stress and anxiety then the physical causes need to be ruled out. These include anemia, diabetes and hormonal imbalance.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "It's not your fault, it's due to a low amount of estrogen. Perhaps you should try watching some porn (don't act like you haven't done it before) sometimes all you need is a little visual stimulation. If that's not working then perhaps talk to the gyno about it. I was having issues with low libido as well and it turns out my body wasn't producing enough estrogen so now I take estrogen supplements on top of birth control and my sex drive is back. I hope everything works out well! Best of luck!",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 25 year old mother of a 4 year old. I have been single and not sexually active for about 5 months. I haven't had sex or masturbated in those months. I still have no physical interest in sex. I'm attracted to men and desire sex, but I have little or no physical drive. I have struggled with a low sex drive for some time and I worry that it will carry into my next relationship. Are there any simple things I can do to boost it? I eat healthy (mostly paleo) and am pretty fit. What am I doing wrong?",
