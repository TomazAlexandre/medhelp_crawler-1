            "answer": "That is an interesting problem.\u00a0\u00a0I can't tell you what to do with your medication, but there are several things I would do I was managing a similar problem with one of my own patients.1. It depends on how low your blood pressure is dropping and if you are having symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If a patient was having symptoms from low blood pressure, I would decrease the dose of medication or stop it all together.2. If the blood pressure before starting blood pressure medications was greater than 140/90 and now it is significantly lower (like an upper number less than 110 and lower number less than 70-75), I would consider decreasing the dose to Amlodac to once daily.\u00a0\u00a0Amoldac could be taken once a day anyway, so changing to once a day is unlikely to do any harm.Make sure you contact your doctor when you get home.\u00a0\u00a0I hope my hypothetical scenario helps.\u00a0\u00a0Enjoy your trip and thanks for posting.",
