            "answer": "I'm sorry. I've also gained about 26 lbs but my midwife isn't upset because I can't walk or anything to counter my weight she just asked me to be more conscience about the foods I eat. I feel bad about how much I gained and it is depressing to me but I don't know what to do.",

            "answer": "I am going through the same thing. I'm 30 wks and the nurse and midwife are giving me crap about my weight. I've gained 33lbs total. They even just assumed all I'm eating is junk food and I haven't touched junk food since I found out I was pregnant. My Dr on the other hand tells me that I'm fine and that we are just having a big baby. The midwife even assumed I had gestational diabetes. What a B****!! My Dr said not to listen to them anymore.. and if she was concerned she would tell me herself. As long as my baby is healthy I really don't care about a few more pounds. It will all come off in the end!! Don't be insecure about anything. This is supposed to be a beautiful experience, so don't let anyone take that away from you!! Eat healthy and exercise if you can and go from there. I wish you all the best!! Good luck!!",

    "question": "I'm 26 weeks and I have gained 27 lbs one of the doctors in the practice asked me what I'm going to do about my excessive weight gain that I'm on track to gain 50 plus lbs by the end. My other doctors weren't concerned. I already felt bad now I just want to cry.",
