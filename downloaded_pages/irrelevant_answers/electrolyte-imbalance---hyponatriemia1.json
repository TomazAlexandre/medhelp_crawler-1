            "answer": "Hello V,Welcome to the Caregivers Forum. I am not an expert but I have some concerns about your post.The normal range for blood sodium levels in the USA is 135 to 145 milliequivalents per liter (mEq/L). His sodium is not significantly low.No one should be drinking salt in there water. This is VERY dangerous given his history of CHF. This will cause fluid to build up in his tissues, including those around his heart and lings. Unless this has been prescribed by a physician please stop this practice immediately!!!He is probably being prescribed a diuretic which will decrease his potassium and sodium levels. K+ replacements can bring up these levels. Please talk to his PCP or seek another opinion. My heart goes out to both of you.Best of Luck to You and your Dad.Please Take Care,~Tuck",
