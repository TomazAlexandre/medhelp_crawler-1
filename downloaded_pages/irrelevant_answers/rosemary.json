Benign and transient proteinuria(protein in the urine) may be experienced after vigorous exercises or in the presence of underlying infections associated with fever. You have mentioned that your son is very active. Does he engage in sports and other vigorous activities? This may partly explain the condition.A repeat urinalysis may be done to determine if the proteinuria is persistent. A 24 hour urine sample collection may be obtained to quantify urine protein levels. A complete assessment may be needed to rule out other possible causes like a glomerular (involvement of kidney units) disease. Blood tests for cholesterol levels, fasting blood sugar and determination of blood pressure levels to rule out hypertension may be necessary.A repeat urinalysis may be called for and management may take from there.",
