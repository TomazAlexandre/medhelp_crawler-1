    "question": "Im 29 weeks, just about 30 in a cpl more days and im feeling fat! Ive gained about 17 lbs so far and this is my first baby. Im 5.10 and weighed 165 lbs before pregnancy and my doc told me not to gain more then 25. Im actually still quite shocked she said only 25 considering my weight was appropriate for my height. So the stress of going over that with still about 10 weeks to go is annoying. Any other ladies sharing the same feelings??? Im sure theres lots!",
