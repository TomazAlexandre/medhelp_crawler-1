            "answer": "Hi there. The causes of burning sensation in leg could be diabetes, vitamin deficiencies, exercise, sciatica, deep vein thrombosis etc. Diabetics are often afflicted with diabetic neuropathies, which attack the nerves of body. Feet, hands and legs may experience pain, numbness and burning sensation and is seen in longstanding diabetes. Vitamin B 12 is responsible for proper functioning of nervous system and brain. This aids in metabolism and produces energy. This deficiency causes dizziness and tingling in hands, legs and feet. Over vigorous exercise can cause tingling due to lactic acid accumulation. Sciatica is characterized by shooting pain starting in the buttock and travels down to the knee accompanied by a burning sensation. Deep vein thrombosis can cause swelling, pain, redness and burning. You need to consult a neurologist for detailed evaluation of your symptoms and certain investigations to direct the therapy as per the diagnosis. Hope this helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "Came to the internet for help. My left leg feels like it is on fire. This has been going on for 4 months now. when it first started my leg and foot felt like it was freezing. I even put a heat pad on my leg but no matter how hot the heat pad it still felt cold. Now it feels like someone has a match burning my leg. It burns all the time day and night. The blood veins in my left leg stick up. when compared to the other leg you cant see the veins in my right leg at all. I have had no injuries. Went to the doctor 4 months ago and she put me on gabapentin. This does not seem to help at all but I take it at night and it helps me sleep. All this started right before I turned 50. When Im up on my leg a lot driving or mowing. The pain gets so bad I could cry. The burning is in my thigh all the way down to my foot. my foot feels cold at times. behind my knee seems to swell and hurt. Somebody help me please",
