            "answer": "It can be normal depending on the type of twins u have and ur health. Are ypurs fraternal or identical?. Fraternal twins usually go the longest because they have their own sac and placenta. Identical can be tricky depending on if they share a placenta or embrionic sac which can cause them to grow slower and get more cramped up which causes the need for an early delivery.",
