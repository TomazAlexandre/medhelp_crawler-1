            "answer": "I agree with JDRF-Team-gg that only your physician can determine the cause of the leg cramps. If your glucose levels have been high for several weeks while you were ill, some of your body's chemical balances may have been upset and you probably are deficient in some minerals. A blood test may help your doctor determine how to treat the leg cramps. As an aside, leg cramps are not really a typical symptom of high glucose.",

            "answer": "Hello,I'm another volunteer, also not a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with both GG & SGG.You can expect your doctor to evaluate things like potassium, magnesium & calcium levels in your blood because low levels can be a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes meds or other conditions can cause changes in levels, as has been pointed out already.\u00a0\u00a0Your doc may also do some testing of your kidney functioning to be sure that organ is properly processing wastes and minerals.Any physical symptom taht starts or appears when we we're sick and/or experiencing elevated blood sugars can also be \"just\" a response to the physical stress of those imbalances.Even tho' it's sort of a \"holiday weekend\" here in the US, it's worth a call to your doc (or his/her on-call support) to discuss specifics.\u00a0\u00a0No need to spend too many sleepless nights due to cramps or worry about them.Good luck and please do let us know what you find out.",
