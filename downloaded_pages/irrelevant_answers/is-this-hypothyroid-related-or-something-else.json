            "answer": "Well last Tuesday i visited my new doctor, she said she would do the blood tests but since i had been diagnosed with hypothyroidism 2 years prior she went ahead and gave me Levothyroxine 50. Monday of this week she called me and said she tested my T2 and T3 levels and said my thyroid levels were fine and that i needed to stop taking the levothyroxine so i didn't take it yesterday. She never gave me the detailed results on the blood test she just said the levels for those 2 tests were in the higher norm.",

    "question": "Today i was riding in the car with my fiance when i started feeling weak and shaky, then i started feeling pretty nauseous and at the same time that this is going on my neck starts feeling tingly and numb and so does the lower part of my face and i noticed on the bottom right side of my neck theres a swollen spot. Also i felt mentally sluggish and tired. This all lasted about 30-35 minutes then went away for a little bit then it hit again but was less severe and lasted half as long.. about 10-15 minutes. Now i feel ok but my neck is sore in that spot, i have a headache and feel tired. Is this thyroid related or something else? I've never experienced this before. Also i'm currently not taking thyroid medicine because i'm waiting on blood tests by a new dr i'm seeing. Was diagnosed 2 years ago with hypothyroidism.",
