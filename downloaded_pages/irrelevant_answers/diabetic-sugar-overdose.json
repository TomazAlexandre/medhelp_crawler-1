            "answer": "My guess is you were experiencing a combination of effects from your illness, antibiotics and the sugar overload. However, I think you really need to examine your diabetes management. Do you test? If not, you should, and you would get a frightening glimpse of just how high all the **** you ate drove you. You make it sound as though you had no choice but eat and drink all that sugar! You had water available to you for thirst so why drink three regular sodas? As for the large peanut butter cookies, not much can be said. As a diabetic I strongly suggest if you are going to be out for a period of time with no access to healthy snacks, you carry your own. Your health, not your golf game, should be your priority. It will be hard to play golf if you have your legs amputated due to diabetic complications.",

    "question": "I was playing golf this past Saturday in very hot and humid conditions and the golf course only had snack or junk food to eat. I drank three regular sodas, (generally I drink diet) and I also ate six large peanut butter cookies. I tried to keep drinking water but I also was trying to keep up my energy. When I got back to my brother's house I started having severe stomach cramps, and later that evening I started feeling like I was having a cold sweat. I had just taken a round of antibiotics for bronchitis which I still have. I am feeling better the abdominal soreness has easied up, but I am still having some bloating but I do feel better after resting. Can this be a symptom of consuming too much sugar while playing golf, or could the antibiotics be causing this pain? Thanks",
