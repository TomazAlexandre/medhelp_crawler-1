            "answer": "Okay, well I am only a teen, I don't have diabetes. But, diabetes does affect your sugars, and I am taking that you mean MS as in Multiple Sclerosis. MS does attack the CNS, not the pancreas. Multiple sclerosis should not make it harder to control your sugar levels, your MS medicines may. Immunosuppressants can cause sugar levels to spiral sometimes, yet this medicine can help with both diseases. You may have a third-hand problem going on. You may need to switch meds.",

    "question": "Does anyone have type 1 diabetes and notice that MS affects their blood sugars? For example has it med it harder for you to control, or does it start to go crazy before or during a flare? I am trying to see if maybe there is a pattern... If you feel that it does affect your sugars if you don't mind sharing how it does I would really appreciate it!",
