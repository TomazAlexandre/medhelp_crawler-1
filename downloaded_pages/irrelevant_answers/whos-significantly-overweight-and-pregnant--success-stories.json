I mean, it's obviously best to lose weight if you're overweight, but it's not critical in carrying a healthy baby to term. hang in there.",

            "answer": "Let me just say i am very overweight and i have had no problems concieving. I got pregnant with my three year old son six months off bc. I am now 29 wks pregnant with number 2. The first time i tried to get pregnant it wasn't really that hard. Second time we weren't even trying. I think it really depends on your body, but especially in today's society there are alot of obese people out there who still reproduce. I also have a friend who is overweight and got pregnant on the first try. Keep your head up I think\u00a0\u00a0you'll be just fine. It would probly help you chances to lose weight but i wouldn't say it's the determining factor of not becoming pregnant.",

I am about 40-50 and conceived either 1st or 2nd month trying 3 times. 2nd PG ended in m/c though :(Of course it's best to get down to an ideal weight prior to conceiving to limit complications when pregnant like GD, higher risk of c-section, etc.Lots of baby dust to you*************",

            "answer": "I was 40lbs overweight when I started out (I am only 5ft so that makes me obese(nasty word!)). I am 35 weeks now and the pregnancy has been a dream, I have gained about 20lbs, but no diabetes or anything, not even a stretch mark. I am just starting to feel like I am about to pop though and have had a bit of swelling in the last week. I already have one child who was born 8 weeks early but that was nothing to do with my weight and although I weighed less when I started that one it was much worse than this, I had back problems, severe heartburn that I needed medicating for and got loads of stretch marks. Every pregnancy is different and it I think the most important thing is being healthy and active during the pregnancy regardless of what your starting weight is.",
