            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your hands, feet, arms, or legs. This feeling of tingling sensations that you are having are called Paresthesia.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome,transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out. Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.The purple bruises that you are having on your legs may be due to leakage of blood from small capillaries of the legs. Anemia and deficiency of vitamins C, K, B12, or folic acid are the common causesof such kind of symptoms.Try taking iron tablets and multivitamins for some days and see if the symptoms improve.Other causes may be lupus,bone marrow disorders or liver disorders.Pls discuss these with your doctor.In case you need m ore information then pls post us.",
