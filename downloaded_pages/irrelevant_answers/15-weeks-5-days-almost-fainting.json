            "answer": "Have you eaten enough today? Drank enough water? Sometimes if you've not had enough food or drink your blood sugar levels can drop way down and cause you to feel faint. Another cause - especially in pregnancy can low iron levels making you slightly anaemic. Maybe an idea to call you doctor and have them check your blood and see if that's the case, it's simply fixed by putting you on iron supplements.",

            "answer": "Dizziness is a common symptom early in the second trimester.\u00a0\u00a0You're body is creating and pumping more blood, about half as much more, to support your pregnancy. Much of that blood is being circulated to your lower abdomen and away from your head. I've felt dizzy during wks 12-14, mainly after standing for a few hours at a time, it's best to sit down, drink water or juice, eat a snack and rest for about 10 minutes before resuming. If the severe dizziness continues for several weeks more, it's best to contact your doctor. (Tests for gestational diabetes doesn't occur until after 20 wks when it's more prevalent.) congrats on your pregnancy!",
