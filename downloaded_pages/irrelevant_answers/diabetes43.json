            "answer": "First thing you need have on hand is a home glucose test meter. The only way you're going to know how the foods you consumed affected your glucose [blood sugar] levels is by testing, testing, and more testing. Times to test are;fasting - first thing in morning b4 having any food or colored liquids [plain water is OK]. This will tell you how much stored sugar your liver is dumping during sleep hours. Normal levels are 60/70 - 99 mg/dl or 3.33/3.88 - 5.5 mmol/lpreprandial - before a meal to get a baseline measurementpostprandial - 2-3 hours after a meal when sugars from foods have plateaued in your blood stream. For diabetics, the postprandial levels goal is <141 mg/dl [7.83 mmol/l], optimum <121 mg/dl [6.72 mmol/l]As t2 diabetic you must make lifestyle changes by eating proper and healthy foods, maintain proper body weight, and exercise 30 minutes daily. Doing all three will help control and manage your glucose levels. Along with avoiding sugary foods a low to no carb diet plan is recommended for t2 diabetics. Carbs to t2 diabetics are the same as sugar - elevates our glucose [blood sugar] above and beyond acceptable levels. A very good place to look for low carb recipes is the Atkins [diet] web sitehttp://tinyurl.com/atkins-recipes . Replace sugar with artificial sweeteners such as Splenda or Stevia. Also, avoid starchy foods like potatoes, rice, and any foods made with white flour - white bread, crackers, pasta/noodles - as these turn quickly into sugar after eating.Post back if you have further questions. Good luck",

            "answer": "Excellent advice above. I have had success limiting carbs to 60 per meal. This not only keeps the readings in non-diabetic territory but leads to significant weight loss; 60 lbs in my case over 12 months.",
