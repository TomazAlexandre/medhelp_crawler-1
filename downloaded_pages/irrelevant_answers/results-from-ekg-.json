            "answer": "Dear DoctorMy 7 year old son, has diabetes mellitus, hypercalcuria, bowel problems, kidney stones, twisted ureters, and see's colours and shapes etc.\u00a0\u00a0He also suffers from odd heart rhthyms at times.\u00a0\u00a0He has tacycarida, and missed heart beats, but the worrying symtom, is when he does the exercise tolerance test, half of his p waves are upside down.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor has said he thinks he has a rogue heartbeat, which takes over every now and then, but that it is not a problem.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned, because my son suffers symptoms of dizzyness, fatigue, feels hot, and see's double, yet, the doctor thinks it's not related.\u00a0\u00a0 (it isn't related to his diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0I am sure it is his heart, as often has symtoms after stress.\u00a0\u00a0I have been told they can burn the extra heart beat, or put in a pace maker.\u00a0\u00a0What is your advice.\u00a0\u00a0Your help would be greatly appreciated.",
