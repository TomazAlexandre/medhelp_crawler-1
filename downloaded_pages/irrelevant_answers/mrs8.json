            "answer": "Are you overweight, diabetic, on any medicines or supplements? It could be fluid retention,Have you seen your doctor? when sitting or lying down have your legs elevated.Edema usually affects the feet, ankles and lower legs, and also impacts any other part of the body, resulting in systemic symptoms.Edema occurs when tiny blood vessels in your body (capillaries) leak fluid. This leakage can result from damage to or increased pressure in the capillaries, or from lowered levels of serum albumin, a protein in your blood. When your body senses the capillaries are leaking, your kidneys begin to retain more sodium and water than normal to compensate for the lost fluid from your blood vessels. This increases the amount of fluid circulating through your body, which causes the capillaries to leak more. The fluid from the capillaries leaks into the surrounding tissue, causing the tissue to swell.Mild cases of edema may result from:Sitting or staying in one position for too long, Eating too much salty food, Premenstrual signs and symptoms, Pregnancy, which can cause swelling in your hands, feet and face from excess fluid retentionEdema can be a side effect of some medications, including: Drugs that open blood vessels (vasodilators), Calcium channel blockers, Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, EstrogensCertain diabetes medicationsIn some cases, however, edema may be a sign of a more serious underlying medical condition. Diseases and conditions that may cause edema include:Congestive heart failure. When one or both of your heart's lower chambers loses its ability to pump blood effectively\u00a0\u00a0as happens in congestive heart failure\u00a0\u00a0the blood can back up in your legs, ankles and feet, causing edema.Cirrhosis. This disease causes scarring of your liver, which interferes with liver function, causing changes in the hormones and chemicals that regulate fluids in your body, as well as increasing pressure within the large blood vessel (portal vein) that carries blood from your intestine, spleen and pancreas into your liver. These problems can result in fluid accumulating in your legs and your abdominal cavity.I suggest you see your doctor A.S.A.P.",
