            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What your suffer from is probably a vasovagal syncope or a vasovagal attack. The complex group of symptoms is mediated by the vagus nerve. This nerve is irritated by prolonged standing, standing up suddenly, stress, pain, hunger, dehydration, intense emotion etc. Hence laughing out too loud can cause this. A tilt table test, holter monitor, echocardiogram etc are done for confirmed diagnosis.What you have can also be postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required.Discuss this with your doctor and get investigated accordingly.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "I was at work last friday in my workshop just after lunch and all of a sudden overcome by a feeling of passing out.i didn't but sat down and thought it would pass,but everytime i got up after got the same feeling and went by ambulance to hospital. gave me blood tests and e.c.g but came back fine. but every alternate day i get the same bad episode.ringing in the left ear, foggy headed,dizzy and disorientated i look at my arms when i move them and it seems like i am not controlling them.i was a social smoker and a bit of a binge drinker at the weekends but have quit both for now.but i also cycle 10 miles to work and 10 miles home again and have been doing this distance for near enough 15 years.must say i have an awful lot of sympathy for the people that have been suffering for years.any input would be appreciated!",
