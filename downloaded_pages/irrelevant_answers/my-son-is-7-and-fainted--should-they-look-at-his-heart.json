            "answer": "Yes, I would ask to see a pediatric electrophysiologist (heart rhythm specialist). Any child who passes out should have a cardiac assessment. Don't let doctors sluff this off as nothing. It very well could be nothing but it needs to be checked out. Have them manually assess his QT interval on the ECG.",

    "question": "My son is 7 years old he passes out about 2 weeks ago while getting a haircut.\u00a0\u00a0This happened one other time two years ago at school in the lunch line.\u00a0\u00a0When it happened the first time I was told not to worry it was probably an isolated incident, or maybe he just needed to eat or drink.\u00a0\u00a0I have epilepsy, so that was considered but again they said if it only happens once no worries.\u00a0\u00a0Well this time it happened on a Sat. He had plenty to eat and drink, so I think we can rule that out.\u00a0\u00a0When this happens he says he feels fuzzy first, he passes out for abut 10 seconds, his eyes stay open but roll.\u00a0\u00a0The most recent time he fainted he tried to throw up afterword,\u00a0\u00a0It has been two weeks and he has not shown any signs of being sick ( no fever vomiting all blood tests normal) .\u00a0\u00a0The first time they did an EEG that came back normal, but he did not fall asleep and we had a hard time getting him to sit still. Now, my doctor is referring him to a neurologist, who cant see him until Feb, again Im told not to worry.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned that because I am epileptic even with no family history of it,\u00a0\u00a0they are jumping too that conclusion too quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I read that the heart should be looked at witch has never bee done,\u00a0\u00a0I am not schedualed too see my doctor again should I ask them to look at his heart?",
