It's a lot safer than asprin (where thousands bleed to death every year from it).JCH MD",

            "answer": "Thank you doctor - that's reassuring to know that Restasis is helping so many people, including your wife and friends.\u00a0\u00a0I am also postmenopausal, so I'm sure that's also contributing to the dry eyes, especially since having to stop the HRT cold turkey in May.\u00a0\u00a0I will definitely give Restasis a try.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again for your input!",

            "answer": "Be very patient. Don't expect much help for 4 months but after that it often gets better for up to a year.Also Omega Fish oil is helpful. If you try that get the ENTERIC COATED FISH OIL\u00a0\u00a0Just take one with your evening meal for two weeks to let you stomach get use to it. Then add a second one with breakfast. 2/day is enough for most people but if you have high cholesterol, a family history of heart attack of stroke then 3 day (1 with breakfast and two with dinner) are better. Also helps dry skin, hair, mouth, nasal passages and vaginal canal)\u00a0\u00a0If you have ultra delicate stomach freeze the fish oil capsultes and take frozen.JCH MD",

            "answer": "Yes, I do take ******* Omega Guard which is a full spectrum of seven Omega-3's including DHA and EPA.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that there have been many studies on the benefits of Omega Fish oil on the eyes and body as a whole, so I started using it sometime ago.\u00a0\u00a0I'll continue with that and give the Restasis a good try.\u00a0\u00a0I have no risk factors such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes or obesity, so I think your suggestion of 2 a day is fine.\u00a0\u00a0That's a great idea about freezing them to ease any stomach upset!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again for all of your help and suggestions!",
