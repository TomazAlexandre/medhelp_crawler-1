            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Prolonged high blood sugar can cause diabetic ketosis and dizziness. The dizziness could also be due to compression of spinal nerves in the cervical region. It can also be due to anemia and periodic drops in blood sugar. Please consult a diabetes specialist and first get the sugar levels under control. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
