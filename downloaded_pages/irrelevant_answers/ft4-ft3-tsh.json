            "answer": "This is a patient to patient forum, not a doctor forum. What help do you need? Get the TSI tests for Graves disease to see if that is what is causing this. If not Graves, then a workup on the pituitary gland to make sure there is no pituitary issue causing this. A good endo should be able to help you with this. Make sure the endo specializes in thyroid, not just diabetes. My endo sees 75 percent thyroid patients. Make sure the endo is willing to test and treat FT4/FT3 levels.If you do indeed have Graves, then the endo will present you with some choices, such as monitoring the condition and giving you meds to slow your heart rate, killing the over-active thyroid gland with RAI or removing the thyroid gland. With no thyroid gland, you will need to take thryoid hormone for the rest of your life. Make sure the doctor is testing and treating your FT3 in regards to prescribing thryoid hormone. Some doctors will only give their patients synthetic T4 drugs, leaving their FT3 levels too low.McMillianNelson, a member on this forum is treating his Graves through a strict diet - no surgery or RAI. You may want to message him and ask about his treatment.:) Tamra",
