            "answer": "Hi Bella,How are you feeling?I am sorry to say but all patients who presents with such symptoms I tell them that pain, tingling and numbness are signs of neuropathy. Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy).This can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.I think in your case it appears to be due to nerve compression due any spinal disc pathology at cervical level.I think you should be doing an MRI study to see for any pathology involved.You should be consulting a neurologist and an orthopaedician at earliest.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",
