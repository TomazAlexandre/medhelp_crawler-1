            "answer": "here is what rosiglitazone does on hbv by henancing PPARgammahttp://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20430009here is the way bitter melon increases PPARgammahttp://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/13/1761.asphttp://www.mendeley.com/research/dietary-seed-oil-rich-conjugated-linolenic-acid-bitter-melon-inhibits-azoxymethaneinduced-rat-colon-carcinogenesis-through-elevation-colonic-ppargamma-expression-alteration-lipid-composition/http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15170673so maybe they target hbv the same way, bitter melon is reported to have mild universal antiviral activity and influence on immune system probably due to PPARgammaat this point we should find the safe high dose of bitter melon with activity on hbv, if there is some.or in other words try to get the same potency of rosiglitazone with bitter melon which\u00a0\u00a0should have less sides of rosiglitazoneabout bitter melon sides there is little said and at correct doses it is free of relevant sides, do you know if it has some chanthou?i have seen sides like coma on a child due to hypo effect but in a small bangladesh study using high dose injected in patients but i guess that's just rubish because there were no doses, number of patients, nothing",

The results of the present study provide new insight into the pathogenesis of HBV infection underlying the deregulation of components of the insulin signaling framework and chronic hepatic metabolic changes.bitter melon might help stop these insulin impairment, it is bad the study cannot link hbx protein with its immune suppressing properties because we know that insulin suppresses hbsag in vitro and that hbx is not a part of hbv virus but it is secreted to impair insulin, block interferon and suppress immune system.what happens if we block or lower hbx influence on insulin by bitter melon or diabetes 2 drugs in vivo?probably no studies in vivo, we only know hbsag, hbvnda lowers in vitro",
