            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having burning in my legs for about 6 weeks. It seemed to start as tingling shortly after a course of cipro.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to a rheumy and a neuro next week.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really scared.\u00a0\u00a0I guess it is probably a small fiber neuropathy and every time I look up causes of that I get scared.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have diabetes or STD's.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure that I will need to go for tons of tests again.Sometimes the burning seems to be worse when sitting or when my clothes rub my skin.\u00a0\u00a0Also, sometimes being really warm, like when I am under the covers at night seems to bother me.If you find anything out, please let me know.\u00a0\u00a0I will let you know if I get any info also.Good luck",

            "answer": "Hi,I think you are having Peripheral neuropathy (PN).Peripheral neuropathy refers to a peripheral nerve disorder of any cause. Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy); pathology may be axonal or demyelinating.Lower back strain and nerve entrapment at the exit from the spine can cause similar symptoms.I appreciate your idea of meeting neurologist. I think you should be asking for imaging study of lower back and electro-diagnostic studies as well.Keep me informed.Bye.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the ideas.\u00a0\u00a0I did hurt my mid back and possibly my lower back late last summer on a four-wheeler.\u00a0\u00a0I hit an unexpected bump while in the process of returning to a sitting position from a standing position.\u00a0\u00a0I felt a surge though my entire spine like I jammed it.\u00a0\u00a0I was having back pain for months.\u00a0\u00a0My dr. didn't seem to care so I blew it off and probably shouldn't have.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have had an mri of my neck showing degenerative arthritis and all dics buldging.\u00a0\u00a0I am 29 years old.I have been seeing a chiro.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be causing more harm than good? I have noticed that when he tries to pop my lower back I get an itching sensation that spreads out from my spine.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I get then this when bending over also.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be related?Thanks again for you post.\u00a0\u00a0I am a very anxious person and talking about it seems to help.\u00a0\u00a0This forum has been a comfort to me.I will let you know how it goes.",

    "question": "Im visiting an allergist soon, but I have prolonged burning feelings on my legs and sometimes my chest.\u00a0\u00a0All of this began after having sexual relations with a past partner.\u00a0\u00a0I had these feelings for nearly two years and they just went away.\u00a0\u00a0For 5 months it was gone this late 2007, but I recently had sexual relations with a new partner. For the 5 months that it was gone, I ate, drank, and did whatever without thinking since perhaps I have sensitive skin, maybe I shouldn't swim or eat this or drink that.\u00a0\u00a0 STD checks came back negative and I show no visible symptoms.Some people told me to check to see if I have Diabetes or some form of NueroPathy that is affecting my nerves.\u00a0\u00a0The burning is about a 4-5/10 and it varies depending on creams I use.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering what to make of all this since its something I never had before and it is quite a nuisance to have. Thanks.",
