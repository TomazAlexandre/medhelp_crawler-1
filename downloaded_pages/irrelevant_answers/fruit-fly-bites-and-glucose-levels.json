            "answer": "Try controlling and managing your unknown glucose levels better. If your skin is sweet fruity smelling and you have full-blown, uncorrected diabetes it can lead to ketoacidosis [DKA], the body has little or no insulin. DKA if left untreated can lead to diabetic coma or death. If your levels are within acceptable ranges you need to get blood work performed as there are a number of disorders which can cause a fruity/sweet smell on the skin. Good luck",
