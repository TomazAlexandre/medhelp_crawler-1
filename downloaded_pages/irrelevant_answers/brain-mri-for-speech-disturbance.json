            "answer": "I'm not sure what you mean by 'speech without the thoughts'It seems like you are a fairly healthy 61 year old, congratulationsthe findings of small lesions as described on MRI are usually due to high blood pressure, hardening of the arteries, migraine or rarer causes like demyelinating disease, or vascultis. They are realtively common in your age group and are usually asymptomatic. If severe enough they could potentially cause urinary or speech problems (a spastic dysarthria) termed pseudobulbar palsy - I do not know how severe they are in your case without seeing the MRIthere is no indication for aspirin unless you have already ha a stroke or had more stroke risk factors like diabetesGood luck",
