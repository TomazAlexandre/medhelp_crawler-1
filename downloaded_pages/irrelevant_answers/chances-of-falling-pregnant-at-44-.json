            "answer": "Hi there,I may be able to confirm whether she can conceive or not only after a complete clinical examination and work up. As a woman ages a woman\u2019s egg supply and quality decreases and eggs which remain are likely to have chromosomal problems .This increases the risk for miscarriage and birth defects. The chances of pregnancy complications like high blood pressure and diabetes are high. There are increased chances of delivering a low-birth-weight or preterm baby. But this may not happen with all pregnancies. If your girlfriend wants to get pregnant she should see a gynecologist for examination and queries. Do keep me posted.Best luck and regards!",
