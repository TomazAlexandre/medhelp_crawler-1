            "answer": "Here's is what I think, and I'm using that term loosely, answers to your question.Diabetes occurs when a person's pancreas produces little or no insulin or when the body rejects the insulin that's produced.Now, there is insulin resistance. If you have insulin resistance, your muscle, fat, and liver cells do not use insulin properly. The pancreas tries to keep up with the demand for insulin by producing more. Eventually, the pancreas cannot keep up with the body's need for insulin, and excess glucose builds up in the bloodstream. Many people with insulin resistance have high levels of blood glucose and high levels of insulin circulating in their blood at the same time.Perhaps if you could clarify what it is you are looking for we could answer this topic in much greater detail.",
