            "answer": "What I see in your post is that apparently your doctor saw a slight abnormality with your thyroid to place you on meds.What's going on with that now? Were there additional tests done to see where your function is? Any antibody tests done?\u00a0\u00a0Was there any possibility of Diebeties?I can't tell how old you are? Could you be in any female hormone distress? I see you had Cushing's tested - What were those cortisol levels?Your med Resperdol can affect thyroid function and alter the TSH labs too. So taking a stab at that with little info - maybe your meds could be affecting you too.What is your doctor saying?",

            "answer": "What were the actual results from any blood tests that have been done?\u00a0\u00a0Don't accept from your doc that it was \"normal\".\u00a0\u00a0That is the most overused word in the thyroid world.\u00a0\u00a0You need to get a copy of the results from your doctor and evaluate them yourself, with maybe a little help from forum members, to see if they ran the right tests and where the results fall within their very broad ranges.\u00a0\u00a0I also suggest that you check your temperature several times a day for several days and compare the average to the optimal of 98.6.\u00a0\u00a0Temperatures below that level are an indication of low metabolism/ low thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, I ran across some info awhile back that indicated that edema can be the result of long term untreated hypothyroidism.",

    "question": "I watch the TV show \"Mystery Diagnones\" and hope they will find my solution.\u00a0\u00a0I have always had irregualr menstral cycles, dry thin hair, weak nails, and depression.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to conceive about 10 years ago and had no response to fertility meds.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing they could ever find wrong was a very low level of prolactin and progesterone.\u00a0\u00a0I accepted my childless fate, but started mental heath meds (resperdal and lexapro) to combat my depression.\u00a0\u00a0One of the side effects of risperdal is increase in prolactin so amazingly my prolactin is back to normal, but I am still the poster child for irregular periods.\u00a0\u00a0I have had my thyroid tested dozens of times with normal results but a resent trip to the hospital yeilded a boarderline low reading so I was placed on .05 of synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained about 175 pounds in 4 years even though I eat very normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have edema in EVERY part of my body and have no stamina for exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I have had an MRI to rule out a patuitary tumor, an ekg to rule out pulimary disease etc, a sonogram to rule out poly-cystic syndrome, and I have seen a kidney specialist and do not have cushings (98% function to all organs and no protein spill).\u00a0\u00a0I have been on max doses of lots of different diaretics, but they have NO affect on me.\u00a0\u00a0I am always thirsty and drink lots of fluids but urinate only a few times a day.\u00a0\u00a0I find it so hard to get arround that I am now unemployed, and uninsured, so have been unable to persue a diagnones. So I am taking things into my own hands and am entering the information super-highway.\u00a0\u00a0Can you please give me some advice?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe an endocronologist, Mayo clinic, gastic bipas, -- where do I start from here?",
