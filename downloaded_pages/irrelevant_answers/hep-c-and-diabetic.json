Just did what I always did/do take my meds and try to watch what I eat. I will say there was period while treating that I craved sweets and gave in more then I should have.What drives me nuts is that it seems to me that my diabetes is caused by having hep c and was hopping that if I knocked the dragon out of me the diabetes would follow.
