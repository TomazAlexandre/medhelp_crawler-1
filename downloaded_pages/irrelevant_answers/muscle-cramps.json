But she needs to do something immediately. Letting this go is a death sentence. Sorry to sound harsh, but this is so important. Please get her help immediately. Take her to ER if necessary.",

            "answer": "Getting a answer to a post depends largely on how the post was worded and/or question asked. It seems you care deeply for your sister. Bravo. One belief I have is called free medication to the poor. Pharmaceuticals many times provide free medication to those who can't afford to get it the normal way. For example; Life Scan provides free blood glucose testing systems to those who qualify as a diabetic. They sent me a new UltraMini in January just by asking. I also asked for extra test strips and lancets. Got boxes of both within days.To go about obtaining free meds she will need a letter from her doctor stating that she is a diabetic and in need of insulin - how much and how often. You or sister need to search the web for insulin producing companies such as Novohttp://tinyurl.com/2uw2qe . Contact them and ask if they have program available for people such as your sister. They advertise that they want to conquer diabetes so put them on the spot. I would email All of them.As LLWB suggested you also can contact social services for assistance. The first thing diabetics lose are their limbs. The description of your sisters toe says she's on her way to losing a foot and/or a leg SOON.Get on the web and search. Send emails. Make phone calls. Do it now.",
