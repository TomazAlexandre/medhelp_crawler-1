            "answer": "Thank you for your reply........I am getting both hypo and hyper symptoms.....My older sister was diagnosed with Hahsimoto and my mom is Hypo and my identical twin was Hyper.....and on meds but not no more.I am not on medication and my doctor said she could either make me a specialist appointment or not ?\u00a0\u00a0 I am not sure ?\u00a0\u00a0 I will ask her for that specialist appointment in the middle of October when I see her.I think we checked my Alt levels again because they were really high last time....although they did go lower......I think the weight gain has caused this elevation.\u00a0\u00a0I gained 10 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0I also had a myometomy on January 31, 2014 to remove fibroids.\u00a0\u00a0 I am now 155 pounds and 5 foot 4inches tall.",

            "answer": "Some symptoms can apply to either/both hyper and hypo; can you please be specific as to which symptoms you have, so we can sort them out and determine where you actually stand.\u00a0\u00a0I see that one of them would have been weight gain (the 10 pounds - which would be a hypo symptom).I did notice that you have another thread going, so I'll have to go read that, as well and try to get all your information and the comments into one, so everything is together.",
