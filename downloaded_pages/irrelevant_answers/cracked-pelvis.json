            "answer": "Hi deb160, how are you and how is your mother doing? Hope she is fine and without pain? Can you please provide more details regarding the fall and the immediate care that was provided to her? Did a orthopedic doctor examine her and were the x-rays taken? At her age, fracture is common and it has to be ruled out first? Rest is absolute and if fracture is ruled out she can move little bit. I suggest you to keep a day care nurse, who can take care of her personal needs and activities without having been straining too much. If going to toilet is too disturbing, she can be given a urinary bag to empty frequently. If not yet seen a doctor, take her for orthopedic consultation. Hope she recovers soon. Take care and share your thoughts.",

            "answer": "HiI feel sorry for your mother.From what you write it appears to be a closed fracture of the pelvis. Did the doctor mention if it was stable or unstable? It is important to know this because unstable fracture is a more severe form of fracture.Healing can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months as the recovery depends upon the dietary status of the patient and the severity of the fracture. Also it could be delayed if your mother has other conditions such as diabetes, calcium deficiency, hypertension etc. Flying after prolonged bed rest increases chances of deep vein thrombosis and embolism; you should discuss these with your doctor prior to air travel.I hope that your mother gets well soon.Regards.",
