            "answer": "I had a similar condition and did 3 months of colon cleansing and my skin is 90% healed. The skin on out the outside indicate what is going on internally. During the cleanse I lost 25lbs because when you're detoxing you are not hungry. Once I understood I had a toxic colon and got into the cleansing with herbs and colonics I felt better and better each month, my energy came back. I am getting to do the liver cleanse which you do after the colon is healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Detox is very difficult, many emotions from childhood came up for me, it was the end of my suffering to well worth it. A good website to check out is www.************.\u00a0\u00a0Try to inspire your wife to cleanse, take colon cleaning herbs and go for colonics, she will never look back.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Generalized feeling of a burning sensation can be due to dry skin, hyperthyroid states, liver or gall bladder dysfunction, peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes or decreased sweating as in Sjogren\u2019s syndrome. This would need a comprehensive investigation.Dry skin is the commonest cause of generalized itching. Applying a moisturizer and using only soaps that are gentle on the skin is helpful in this case. Hypothyroidism too causes dry skin. Please get your thyroid function checked. It could also be due to overuse of AC and heaters.\u00a0\u00a0If you have blisters at tip of fingers and dry skin then you need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition.Generalized itching can be due to allergy. Common allergens are pollen, mold, dust, pet dander, synthetic fiber, food, cosmetics (powders, soaps, shampoos\u2014see if anything was recently changed) or drugs. Food allergies like to gluten, lactose, sea food, and alcohol etc too should be looked into.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be due to new soap, talcum powder, clothes etc. She must get an allergy test done, either a skin test or RAST, to know what you are allergic to. Fungal infections like tinea corporis and tinea cruris too cause whole body itching along with genital itching. Liver problems too can cause generalized itching.Menopause is another reason for this. Low estrogens are supposed to be the cause. Try a diet rich in estrogens. Hormone replacement therapy can also help a few. PCOD and hormone imbalance too can be a cause.Since I cannot examine your wife and know other related conditions she may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "My wife has suffered from a chronic skin condition for over ten years that causes her to become itchy and red over her entire body and if she does not take antihistamines regularly (every 2 days) she experiences an intense burning sensation along with the symptoms already mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0Around the same time this skin condition developed, she also noticed sores on her face.\u00a0\u00a0These sores would quickly appear and then weep a honey colored fluid and then eventually clear up.\u00a0\u00a0Over the past ten years she has various outbreaks on her face and has managed her other condition with antihistamines.\u00a0\u00a0But no doctor or dermatologist has been able to provide her with any real diagnosis.One doctor diagnosed her with Dermato graphism which refers to her skin's response to touch.\u00a0\u00a0It leaves a red mark and if scratched, swells up temporarily.\u00a0\u00a0This happens all of the time, but when she has an episode (usually after 3 days of not taking antihistamines) it happens all over her body even without touch.\u00a0\u00a0After seeing four dermatologists she has basically been told to keep taking antihistamines, but is that a satisfactory conclusion?For one, is there a long term risk of constant antihistamine use?\u00a0\u00a0And since they never identified a cause, or a correlation with the facial sores we both feel dissatisfied.It would seem that the sores and the itchy burning skin are related.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sounds like a particular condition?\u00a0\u00a0Any input on this would be much appreciated.",
