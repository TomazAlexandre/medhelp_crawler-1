            "answer": "Well, since adverse side effect are the main cause of discontinuing chemotherapy, was that the case there? Because of the neuropathy?Then you'd zero in on what particular chemo was used and see its reputation for causing neuropathy. If there was pre-exisitng diabetes, that maybe could have contributed.There are the usual drugs but also a vitamin supplement approach, that I think was developed out of M D Anderson Cancer Center in Texas (which centered around B6 if I recall correctly).",

            "answer": "There are 2 approaches that I know:- use of prescription drugs such as are used for epilepsy, etc (eg, Neurontin)- use of the supplements as mentioned, which might not be as powerful but won't have the side effects that the drugs doSince there are so many diabetics, and diabetes causes neuropathy (though via a different mechanism), research there is leading the way. I'd meant to ask if your Pt had pre-exisiting diabetes, which might account for the quick development of the possible neuropathy. Also, the corticosteroids (like prednisone and dexamethasone) that are sometimes given during chemo also can lead to diabetes if the Pt does not eat correctly. Corticosteroids increase insulin resistance and so lead to elevated serum glucose.",
