            "answer": "It is a test for gestational diabetes. I don't know about false positives because it will actual give your glucose level. The drink is interesting. It's tastes like the syrup they put in pop (soda) without the carbonation. They usually refridgerate it so it's nice and cold. You have to drink it within 10-15 minutes and then they'll draw your blood an hour later!",

            "answer": "It may sound wierd but I thought the drink was good. It was like a flat orange soda. They draw your blood and thats it... The results take a day or two but its easy... If you fail the 1 hour glucose they will schudle you a 3 hour test. If you pass the 1 hour then you should be good.",

            "answer": "There's no false positives, it is what it is.\u00a0\u00a0Like the others said, you drink the drink, go back in an hour (oh yeah, pee in a cup before you drink) and have bloodwork drawn......It's not that bad.....I've done the 1 hour twice already and the 3 hour once......The 3 hour is rough..but 1 hours are no biggy!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "There is no positive or negative.\u00a0\u00a0Your blood will be checked to see how much glucose is in it.\u00a0\u00a0If it's under a certain level you're fine if it's over a certain level they will want you to come back for a 2 or 3 hours glucose.\u00a0\u00a0That will be part of determining if you have gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I think there IS a high rate of \"failing\" the 1 hr....I've heard many other women, and myself with 3 different preg. fail the 1 hr and have to do the 3 hr.\u00a0\u00a0Two of my times my 3 hr came back fine.\u00a0\u00a0This time it came back that i'm borderline diabetic so I was just instructed to watch my starch and sugar intake.",
