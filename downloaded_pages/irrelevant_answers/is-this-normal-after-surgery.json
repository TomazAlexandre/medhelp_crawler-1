            "answer": "Kimmi, When my son had his craniopharyngioma removed (also \"up the nose\") he was given a large dose of an antibiotic, Cephtrioxone, immediately before, and I think even during the operation (in his IV). This led to an overgrowth of Clostridia Difficile bacteria and by the third day after surgery he was very sick, lethargic and had severe diarrhea. Luckily he was still in the hospital.I think you should call your mother's doctor and ask about getting blood tests done for C. Diff toxins and other infection. Watch for the diarrhea.My son slept a lot when he came home eight days after surgery, but I assumed he was making up for lost sleep, since he was woken or disturbed in hospital every 4 hours for blood draws and vital signs. He said he just needed to sleep. (I think his longest stretch was 11 hours.However, 20 hours is excessive and will cause dehydration. I think this alone could cause your mom to feel confused and \"out of it\", and she should not be allowed to sleep this long.Ask the doctor about taking her off the morphine. My son used no pain killer after surgery. He said he didn't need it and refused to take anything for pain.I hope your mom feels better very soon. Call the doctor asap.Enzy",

She needs to get these in an IV if you can't get her to take them, so she should be back in the hospital in this case for sure. She MUST take these medications!",

            "answer": "Hi-I would call her doctor now or take her to the ER.If she seems out of it like that, she might have a sinus infection or even meningitis. Take her temperature. You can also see if there is pressure on her face (sinuses). By now she should be up and about more. Could be that the pain meds are too strong also.Horselip",

Must drink a few gallons a day to keep up with what I pee out. At night I take a medication called DDAVP that helps me to retain fluid so that I can sleep through the night. But I also have to weigh myself every morning. If I gain over 3# I have to ease up on the drinking. If I lose 3#, I have to take the medication or up my fluid intake. It is a very tricky condition. My thirst mechanism in intact so I do get thirsty when I need fluids. The highest my sodium ever went was 151 and I was quite dehydrated. At first is was very hard. But now four years later, I've got the drill down. And yes, DI can kill you because of the huge fluid shifts from being over or under hydrated.Horslip",

It may be a lot on you to take full-time classes and take care of a sick mother at the same time.Once your mom gets stable, things will get easier, but as I know (I am panhypopituitary and take everything but for DI currently), stable is only as good as not getting a cold, etc. so stable can change rapidly. Get a medic-alert bracelet for her, and make sure her meds are regulated and she and people around her know what to do.",

Talk to the pharmacist and/or doctor about how to arrange the medications (like if she needs calcium it should not be with thyroid etc.) as some have to be without food, with food etc. and slot them with in the boxes. I ignore the morning, afternoon etc, as I need with food, without etc LOL but the point is with the medications all laid out, you can see what she has taken, what she has not and it is easier.That is another idea.",
