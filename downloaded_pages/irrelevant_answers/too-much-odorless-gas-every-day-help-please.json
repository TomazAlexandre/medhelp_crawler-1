            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Do you pass stools normally? Collection of gas exclusively in the right upper quadrant can happen if there is a local colon pathology, like an obstruction. Hope diabetes has been ruled out. Diabetes can cause autonomic neuropathy and affect the digestive system, leading to problems with digestion and elimination. It can also cause slower motility of the intestinal tract leading to gas formation. If other conditions are ruled out, your symptoms can be due to irritable bowel syndrome. Discuss these options with your doctor when you happen to meet him next time.In the meantime, begin with good lifestyle measures to control your symptoms. Exercise regularly. Take frequent small meals. Avoid those foods which are high in oil content. Eliminate alcohol, stop smoking and avoid caffeinated beverages and spicy food.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
