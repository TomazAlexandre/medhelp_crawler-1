            "answer": "Obviously we cannot diagnose your Mom's problems, has her GYN examined her for polyps in the uterus, that can cause excess bleeding, and anemia.Has her GYN done a transvaginal ultrasound and a CA125 blood test? That could\u00a0\u00a0probably rule out OVCA and the doctor could check her female organs. Have Mom tell her GYN she'd like those tests done.I assume that she's seeing an internist for her other problems, the spot on her lung, the emphysema, diabetes, anemia and abnormal mammogram.You and she really need to sit down with her doctors, and get her health issues attended to, she needs coordination of her doctors, and her issues.I understand that you're scared for your Mom, but you both need to be more aggressive with her doctors, and get her back to good health,Good luck to her, and keep us posted.JaneJane",

            "answer": "The abnormal, erratic and sometimes heavy bleeding reminds me of my peri-menopause days (actually years). I just felt awful at times, not myself at all. But it was the big shift in hormones going on. Your Mom is around the right age.You're right that a pap smear will not show ovarian problems. I agree with Jane that your Mom should keep a list of what she's been told about the various test results and then start asking more questions. Find out exactly what the spot on the lung is about, a follow up mammogram is not unusual if she's still young enough to have fairly dense breast tissue (I went through that up until a year ago when my boobettes finally deflated LOL), and a TVUS would be excellent to get a good look at her ovaries and uterus. Fibroids in the uterus can cause wacky periods too.",

            "answer": "Yes, I think they told her that she should get an ultrasound test or something like that. I'm just afraid for her.The pulmonologist told her that the spot on lung was not cancerous and that it was caused by the emphysema. She was supposed to be getting treatment for it, but then she found out that the doctor had prescribed the wrong medicine, which made her get worse, and she hasn't gone back since.I asked her if she thought she had cancer, and she said, \"No, I DON'T have cancer\" and laughed at me. It gets me mad, because she never takes her health seriously.",

            "answer": "Hon she make take her health seriously, but cancer is something that all of us think only happens to someone else. I am glad she is going in to have other tests run. Of course we cannot tell you if it is cancer or not, but it is good her Dr is following up. I hope that all turns out well for her.Chris",

    "question": "My mom (she's 49) recently went to a gynecologist because she was having problems with her period. She either got it too often (at one point she was getting it like every week) or got it not often enough (she wuld have to wait months). She would also bleed very heavily sometimes, like she would have to wear two pads so that blood wouldn't go through her pants.Lately, it seems to be kind of regular, and she hasn't been bleeding as heavily.The doctor did a Pap smear test on her and told her that she didn't have cancer. But from what I understand, Pap tests are for cervical cancer, not ovarian. The doctor still didn't think that what she was describing was normal, so she had my mom do a mammogram (I don't get how it's related), and today she got a letter saying that there was something in the exam that called for further evaluation and that she should get more tests done.I've been looking up some of the symptoms for Ovarian Cancer, and she does have a few of them, like abdominal pain at times, and a while ago, she used to complain about pain around her appendix area, which I think is near the pelvis, right?But I don't know if the abdominal pain is due to that or some bacteria that doctors told her she had a while ago. She went months ago to check for colon cancer, and they told her she had a really bad bacteria and they made her take this medicine that was so strong that she can't take it again for two years.She was also having breathing problems and they took a chest x-ray. They found a spot on her lung, but they told her that it was because she was developing emphysema.I'm really scared for her. :(\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what I would do if she had it.My mom also lives under immense amount of stress (more than most people) so I don't know what role this plays in problems with her period. She also has diabetes and anemia.Help?",
