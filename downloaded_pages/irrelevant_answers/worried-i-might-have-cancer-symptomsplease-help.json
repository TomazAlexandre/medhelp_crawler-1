            "answer": "The fact that you have PCOS actually means that you have a decreased probability of having ovca.\u00a0\u00a0 Do make an appointment with your doctor. Your symptoms do need a proper study by a doctor, and if you have not already done so, then I suggest seeking the medical advice of a endocrinologist as well as a gynocologist.",

    "question": "I am 29 years old, I have had endometriosis and PCOS for around 3 years now. 4 laparoscopic surgies, ovarian drilling, partial hysterectomy, and so on....recently my hair has been falling out, especially after showering. Hair is always coming out when I brush it or run my fingers through it. Also, I have been real tired all the time as well as having cramp like pain. I also felt somwthing by my right ovary that feels like a small hard pebble and hurts when i touch it. Does this mean my ovarian cysts have come back again? I just had surgery for ovarian drilling this past April. Should I be concerned about cancer?",
