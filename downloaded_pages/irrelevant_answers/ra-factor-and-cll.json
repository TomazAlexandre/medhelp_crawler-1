    "question": "I am a 50 year old woman with CLL, diabetes and COPD., My CLL is considered indolent.Stage 1-2 . Over the last 5 months I have steadily developed increased pain and stiffness symetricly in my hips and elbows. Sometimes in my hands too. It has become debilitating. My RA level has come back very, very high.\u00a0\u00a0and I'm now on painkillers daily. Is this a sign my CLL is transforming into something more aggressive? Or a new thing ? I should mention I had been on prednisone for 12 years prior for the COPD. Off them now, taking advair.This discussion is related to/posts/show/227232.",
