    "question": "For 2 weeks I have been experiencing constant numbness which started in my feet and the next day continued into my legs, stomach, back, lower arms and hands. I have been to 7 doctors now, they tell me it's anxiety or they simply don't know what to say and tell me it's a medical mystery. My blood tests are negative and I have been tested for everything from diabetes to HIV. Vitamin levels are good too. This whole thing is making me crazy. My extremities are so tired after a day's work and it's effecting my sleep, and mental state too. I have been given sleep aid, and a very small dose of an anti depressant, nothing helps with the tingling though. I'm fatigued trying to figure this out, and am searching for any and all medical advice I can find. Thank you for taking the time to read this and any advice you can offer :)",
