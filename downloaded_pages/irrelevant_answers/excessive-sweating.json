            "answer": "It is difficult to say for certain what is causing your symptom. Sweating is one of the major symptoms of menopause. It is good that you have been checked for diabetes. If you are in menopause now,\u00a0\u00a0your thyroid needs might change since your estrogen is lower. Talk with your doctor about rechecking your thyroid levels.If your doctor is unable to find a cause, you could discuss with him/her about taking a short course of estrogen. If the symptoms go away, it would explain that they are due to menopause. If they do not, it would mean that further evaluation is needed.Machelle M. Seibel, MD",
