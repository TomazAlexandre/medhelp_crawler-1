            "answer": "Hi, motility disorders can cause the symptoms described by you. Motility disorders are functional disorders. Medications to promote motility may help in emptying the intestines by promoting motility. Medications to control acid levels and to promote motility will help with this condition. Diabetes mellitus can cause autonomic neuropathy and consequent slower motility of the intestinal tract. Hope this has been ruled out. Follow up with your doctor. Regards.",

            "answer": "Hi, diabetes has not been ruled out, and now that you mentioned it i made blood and urine test prior to h pylori treatment and sugar levels where normal only thing that stood out was ketones in urine.Ultrasound of abdomen and liver tests where ok.And the doctor said that excess ketones was due to diet that i had because of diet on which i had been due to gastritis.Also i must say i have sometimes blurred vision and weakness.Urination is i think normal, but wen i go to sleep i urinate and the again after cca 1hrs i need to go again and that's it.What other checkups do you recommend??And to clarify i don't have any heartburn and constipation.My bowel movements are normal(once in morning after waking up) and the stool is most of the time soft and normal color.I am mostly concerned because my weight loss.Any suggestion is welcome.Thanks,",
