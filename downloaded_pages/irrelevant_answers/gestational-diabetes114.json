            "answer": "Did you fail the 1 hour test or did you fail the 3 hour? I had GD with my last pregnancy and no matter how hard we tried to control it with diet, I ended up needing to go on insulin injections. Not fun but we do what we have to do for our babies, right?Did the doctors tell you if you'll need insulin? Are you checking your own blood sugar? The first step is obviously for you to start following a diabetes diet which, like jifnif explained, is low carb and high protein.I think it would help us help you if you were a little more explicit with your situation.",
