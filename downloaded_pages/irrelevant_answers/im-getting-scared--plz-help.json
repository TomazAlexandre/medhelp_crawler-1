    "question": "somthing i forgot to mention is i get really light headed when i stand up, its like all the blood is rushing to my head or something and my vision will usually go out of focus for a few seconds. it doesnt matter whether i was laying down or sitting before that (though its worse if i was laying down), and with that feeling i also tend to fall or i have to grab hold of something before i do. it only lasts a few seconds to a minute but its really annoying me.another thing yesterday i was walking through the grocery store with my mom (i had probably been walking 15-20minutes) and i felt like i had run a marathon. i was short of breath, my heart was pounding, and i stopped at one of those blood pressure machines and it was 138/88 and my pulse was 134. i used to run all the time and it scares me when that happens because it makes me think i have something more serious going on. i was also in pain at the time but it only ever feels like that when im in pain so bad i just want to scream, but it was no where near it that time it was more like the normal pain im starting to get more used too. a few times that its happened i felt like i was going to faint. one time that it happened i guess it looked that i was going to because some lady came up and asked me if i was ok or if i needed help. and right now ive been laying on the couch for the past 2 hours or so but my hearts pounding and my pulse is 129.im\u00a0\u00a0scared because what if i do pass out the next time it happens and theres no one around. ive asked my mom to schedule a doctors appt. but im not sure when i can get in and the doctors so far have said my high blood pressure and pulse are related to the pain im in but i think its something more.please help mechryssa",
