            "answer": "Just one more comment to add to what has already been written. Most endocrinologists will put a diabetic patient who uses insulin on a sliding scale of insulin, depending on what the blood glucose is when you test before a meal. The ideal is of course for glucose levels to be in the \"normal\" before meal range of between something like 70-126 (different doctors use slightly different numbers, but this is pretty typical). But we can't always have the ideal numbers -- if we DID, we wouldn't be diabetic! If glucose levels are higher than this, most patients are told to take a little extra insulin to lower the levels, and usually this is done by using a mathematical formula that is specific for YOU and your needs (the formulas vary from person to person). So you do need to ask your endocrinologist to work this out for you.So the idea is to adjust the insulin dose in order to try to reach that ideal range as often as possible throughout the day.",
