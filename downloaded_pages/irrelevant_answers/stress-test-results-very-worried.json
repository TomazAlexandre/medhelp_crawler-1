            "answer": "Two things, first and most important, STOP SMOKING! Congrats on being smoke free for a week, it must be tough. Secondly, don't panic, take the nuclear stress test and see what the results are. These tests are 85 - 90% accurate and will identify any areas of possible blockages. Until then, don't stress out, it will only make it worse.Based on the description, it sounds like the test revealed a change in your EKG under stress, most likely an ST Segment Depression. There are many causes for this. It could be something as simple as a lead that was not placed properly. I would just wait for the test, if your doctor had any immediate concerns you would already have had the test, just try to relax. (easier said than done!)Good luck,Jon",

    "question": "Im a 32 year old male. Diagnosed with type 1 Diabetes a year & a half ago (good glucose control)Im not over weight.Good cholesterol.My heart does skip (PVCs) but so does my Mothers, Fathers, & Brothers. (Been that way since i was a teen)Smoker for 18 years (half a pack to 1 pack a day)Have been watching diet & walking 3-5 times a week since being diagnosed with Diabetes.Had some chest pain 6 months ago, went to hospital, Bloodwork was normal and doctor said it was pulled muscle but since im a diabetic he set up an appointment for a stress test.The last 6 months ive been experiencing alot of pain in my left arm, i have a office job and i tend to lean over on my left elbow all day while on computer, i believe this to be the reason for my pain!I did mt Treadmill stress test last week, got my heart rate to my target, finished the test without any pain. (took approx 10-15 mins)However, the Heart doctor informed me that twice there was a \"Depression\" in my heart and said that the test was \"inconclusive\". He has set up an appointment for me to have a \"Cardiolite Stress test\" (Im waiting for that appointment)I am very nervous about this, what is the chances that there is something wrong with my heart?? What should i expect.Also, since the stress test (6 days ago) i havent had a cigarette. Im noticing that my resting heart rate is between 55-67 (once i noticed it was 51)Is this heart rate too low?? should i be concerned??",
