            "answer": "Hi!Usually pain after FUTH persists for 48-72 hours and subsides with pain killers. Repeated incisions are the cause of pain. After one and half years, if the pain and numbness is persisting, then this could be due to a bad case of dandruff or due to poor blood supply or damage to nerve endings. Diabetes and hypothyroidism too could be the cause. First consult a skin specialist to treat the dandruff and consult your doctor regarding blood tests for diabetes and thyroid. If your pain persists even after dandruff is treated and there is no diabetes or thyroid disorder, then you will need to consult a neurologist. You may or may not need CT scan or MRI.Since you probably work on computers, the pain and numbness can also be due to pinched nerves in the neck. Use a hard bed to sleep. Avoid a pillow. Roll a towel and place it under your neck while sleeping on the back and between head and shoulder when lying on the side. Initially this will be uncomfortable but with time the acupressure may work. Use an analgesic cream or spray in the neck and upper back. If this helps relieve the pain then consult your neurologist too along with the skin specialist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for sparing time and responding to my query.\u00a0\u00a0It is\u00a0\u00a0definitely helpful to get remedy for it.The dandruff wasn't earlier and is only started after transplant. As I mentioned that I had transplant using both the types but, pain and numbness is in the crown part where the FUHT was used and not in the front part where FUE was used so the only thing that I can conclude is the operation as part of FUHT has caused something.Earlier this year, I had blood tests and no diabetes or hypothyroidism was detected. Though, as per your suggestion I'll get it done again.I'm also using hard bed on ground from past 2 years.I'll visit the doctor with whom I got transplant done and if there treatment doesn't helps then will look for some neurologist.Thanks again,Abhishek",

            "answer": "Hi Abhishek, have you got it consulted again? What they said? How do you feel now? It might be because of the procedure fault. See, I have a suggestion. When you go in search for hair transplant clinics, make sure that you hire a good clinic. Don't let your body parts get harmed from any treatments. I have known man patients who are completely satisfied with the hair loss treatment they have undergone. Seager Medical Group at Toronto, Ontario is one of the good clinics which I know. Anyway, get well soon. Keep posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hello,Yes, I had consulted the doctor and they mentioned that, post surgery this kind of issues are expected but my concern was how long, as it has been 2 years now.Doctor mentions that we just take a strip out from back of your head and it doesn't affect main nerves. But since, part of body was taken out some small nerves will take time to get repaired/join back.Though pain in not that severe but, i can easily feel it since my job is to sit with cool mind and do coding for software application. It requires lot of concentration and focus which, I'm not able to post treatment.As I mentioned that, I had FUE (non invasive) & FUHT (Invasive). I'm satisfied with FUE and hairs are still growing normally without any pain to that part whereas, crown area where I had FUHT, hairs had fallen again.I always had a thought to avoid any kind of operation that effects body parts but, agreed to FUHT as doctors mentioned that, pain would not last longer than 4-5 months and it will gradually decrease. Every time I take small amount of headache/pain killer medicine such as combiflame\\paracetamol\\crocin I feel sleepy which again effects my productivity in office.I did had comparison and details of doctor's credentials and was satisfied as both doctors running clinic were certified plastic surgeons.Thanks\\Abhishek",

    "question": "Hello,My Self Abhishek, 31 years old. I had hair transplant in Jan. 2012, using FUHT (Follicular Unit Hair Transplant) method\u00a0\u00a0 where a strip of hair is taken out from back of head and then hairs from that strips are inserted into the bald area on the head.It was told to me that, the pain/rashes/numbness after this surgery will go after 4-5 months but, still after 1.5 years\u00a0\u00a0I'm having pain/Numbness and dandruff.My query is:Can Neurologist\u00a0\u00a0help here to identify the problem as it is related to head surgery?Can there be a possibility that stitching after taking the string at back of head was not done properly causing issues?Would I be needing CT Scan to get some details and thereafter prescribed remedies?Since, I'm a Software professional so it is bothering me a lot as I'm not able to concentrate properly in my work. Having some pain killers gets me into dizziness and sleep and moreover, I can't take pain killers even of lower power on daily basis.Had I been into any other professional where lot of logical thinking and concentration is not required then, It wouldn't have bothered me much.Thanks in advance for considering my query.Regards\\Abhishek",
