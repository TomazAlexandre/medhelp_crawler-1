            "answer": "Actually, a tiny infant could react strongly to an adult's glipizide meds, but how quickly is really the question you are asking. 45 minutes after ingestion seems to be plenty of time for the medicine to start lowering his glucose levels. His non-fasting glucose seems very normal. I would guess that his reaction was indeed just that: a reaction to the glipizide.But his dad could certainly occasionally do a random glucose test on the little guy if he thinks his son is showing any symptoms of either hypoglycemia or diabetes. An occasional random glucose test could clear up any fears fairly quickly, but do remember that normal, healthy people have glucose levels that change throughout the day.",

            "answer": "HELP!!!\u00a0\u00a0I have two teenaged boys ages 13 and almost 15 who are overweight.\u00a0\u00a0My oldest who is almost 15 is pre-diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0My husband is a newly diagnosed diabetic and has it under control with Byetta and diet.\u00a0\u00a0I have 4 other children ages 5 to 12 that are very thin.\u00a0\u00a0For the last 3 years, we have done the following to try and help their weight.\u00a0\u00a0Going to the gym before school 3-5 times a week - inlcuding a regular \"boot camp class\" and running at least a mile every time we go. Enrolling in sports. Snow skiing almost every Saturday and Holiday for the last 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0Summer boating - wakeboarding, skiing - at least once a week.\u00a0\u00a0As far as diet.\u00a0\u00a0We eat only 100% whole grains.\u00a0\u00a0I grind my own wheat and make a lot from scratch w/ no sugar or salt - pancakes, waffles, biscuits, pizza...\u00a0\u00a0I have never kept junk food or soda in the house although they get it at school, family functions, activities, & such more than I think should be legal.\u00a0\u00a0We have a dessert as a family probably once a month at the most.\u00a0\u00a0I don't keep snack foods in the house except for fruit although I catch the kids making a piece of toast every once in a while.\u00a0\u00a0Generally there is not a lot of snacking going on in our home.\u00a0\u00a0Our portions I would say is the one thing that might be a little high but I don't think outrageous.\u00a0\u00a0An example of a dinner meal for our family of 8 would be a 9x13 pan of some sort casserole with a salad and vegie.\u00a0\u00a0There is usually no left-overs.\u00a0\u00a0An example at breakfast would be 2-3 small/medium whole wheat pancakes w/ light syrup and no butter.\u00a0\u00a0For lunches at school believe it or not and I can check this online, 70% of the time they get salad and breadsticks. (i know the breadsticks aren't great)\u00a0\u00a0This may be a little high in portions - I am not sure.\u00a0\u00a0Snacking at our house is very minimal.\u00a0\u00a0Ok... we are not 100% perfect on this - when we go out I will order the kids a pizza.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes we take the kids to a buffet, and occasionally mac-n-chees is just way to easy to pass up.\u00a0\u00a0But for the most part - 80 -90% of the time we are pretty diligent.\u00a0\u00a0My boys last year went off sugar for 6 months and of course lost nothing on their BMI - but for the first time didn't gain anything either.\u00a0\u00a0No progress - just stayed the same.With all of this, they just keep gaining.\u00a0\u00a0My oldest is the most active and he had grown 4 inches in the last 3 years and has gained over 40 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0(he has not hit his growth spurt yet as verified by the doc)\u00a0\u00a0He is 5'4 and weighs 165. His BMI borders on obese now.\u00a0\u00a0My 13 year old is at 5'0 and weighs about 130.\u00a0\u00a0He has gained 15 pounds in the last year.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what else to do!\u00a0\u00a0I think there are some definite medical issues here.\u00a0\u00a0I think that with the insulin resistance that their cells are not accepting the energy effectively and it is mostly being stored as fat.\u00a0\u00a0On my study of Insulin Resistance, a calorie can become more than a calorie.I have been to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0They tell me it is input as opposed to output.\u00a0\u00a0They keep turning it back on me.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what else I can do.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why they keep gaining.\u00a0\u00a0I feel that there are factors beyond my control.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor won't even consider medication.\u00a0\u00a0Is there medication that would help them process sugars correclty?\u00a0\u00a0Doesn't it make sense that if your body can't process correctly that you NEED help losing weight?I feel really desperate!\u00a0\u00a0Wouldn't something like Metphormin or Byetta be great for anyone who is insulin resistant or pre-diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0Any advice on what I can do to help my boys or if there is something that I am not doing right or at all that I can try.\u00a0\u00a0I am at a complete loss!",

    "question": "Recently my 19 month old grandson got a hold of his dad's glipizide and chewed up 1- 1 1/2 tablets, they got most of the second one out of his mouth.\u00a0\u00a0took him to the hospital where they immediately ran serum glucose levels, which came out to 47.\u00a0\u00a0this was within 45 min. of the ingestion.\u00a0\u00a0they started a glucose drip and fed him graham crackers and gator aide and monitored him overnight.\u00a0\u00a0My question is .....could it be his glucose level was already low secondary to a developing diabetes type I or can that medicine act that quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I think we may have stumbled on to something accidently.\u00a0\u00a0I checked his nonfasting glucose level just now and it was 121.Any ideas?",
