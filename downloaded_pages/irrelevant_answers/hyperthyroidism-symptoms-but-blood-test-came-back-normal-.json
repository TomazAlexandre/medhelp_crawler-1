            "answer": "My premature grey hair was from vitamin B12 deficiency (in my case due to autoimmune pernicious anaemia) which reversed when I corrected my B12 deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0I also have vitiligo, Hashimoto's thyroiditis and alopecia areta.There was a time I was VERY hyperthyroid but my labs were showing hypo because I was in a state of Hashitoxicosis (Graves antibodies in this particular instance\u00a0\u00a0since leakage symptoms of Hashimoto's thyroiditis is mild in comparison - you can check the link below on another answer of mine about Hashitoxicosis). The only lab showed I was hyperthyroid at the time was the thyroglobulin serum test (which was high due to being hyperthyroid).http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Thyroid-Disorders/Hashitoxicosis/show/2719050Excerpt from Bel Mara Health - Vitiligo linked to simultaneously existing autoimmune diseases...\"Vitiligo, an autoimmune skin condition, is linked to simultaneously existing autoimmune diseases. Researchers from St. Luke\u2019s-Roosevelt Hospital Center created a questionnaire to be answered by children and adults who had vitiligo to determine other coexisting autoimmune diseases, which may appear along vitiligo.Based on the survey results, the most common vitiligo-associated autoimmune diseases (VAAD) were hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism, rheumatoid arthritis, pernicious anemia, type 2 diabetes, alopecia areata, psoriasis, chronic urticaria, type 1 diabetes, ulcerative colitis, celiac disease, Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s syndrome, Raynaud\u2019s disease, lupus, sarcoid, Crohn\u2019s disease, dermatitis herpetiformis, Addison\u2019s disease, and multiple sclerosis.In an alternative study conducted by researcher Iltefat Hamzavi, other VAAD found in the participants of his study also included linear morphea, Guilllain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and myasthenia gravis, along with the conditions listed in the previous study.\"",

    "question": "Hi, I had a blood test last week to determine what might be causing anxiety that I've had for 7+ years. One of the things they said they test for is thyroid disorders, and while looking for information I noticed that along with anxiety, a lot of other problems I've had for a long time match the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.This includes constant fatigue, inability to put on weight, thin skin, heat sensitivity, shortness of breath, muscle weakness, heart palpitations, eyes that water excessively, lump in throat, as well as premature graying of some pubic hair and a few eyelashes and vitiligo (only on one section of my body), both of which are linked with hyperthyroidism.The blood test came back normal, but is it possible that for some reason I could have hyperthyroidism anyway, or could it be some other condition with similar symptoms?",
