            "answer": "Hi--I'm not a physician or a nurse and don't know the statistics and specifics.But I do know that a year ago, my Dad, who just turned 84, had his aortic valve replaced, triple bypass, and a portion of his aorta removed due to a transthoracic aneurysm. They did all this in one surgery which lasted I think about 4 hours.He made it through the surgery (though recovery was a bit slower than what was expected because he waited too long to have the surgery and his diabetes was a bit of a problem), and today he is as sassy as ever!Good luck.",
