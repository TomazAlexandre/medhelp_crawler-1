            "answer": "Oh heck yes!! It takes a while to get into your system properly. It actually took about 4 weeks to start working. I had really bad nerve pain from type 1 diabetes and I honestly thought I was going to suffer forever. For the first 3 weeks on lyrica. I felt so yucky! I was exhausted, no appetite, dizzy, fragile basically. the only reason why I didn't give up on it was because I had tried so many things that I had to just hang in there. You'll be crappy for a couple of weeks but the effects do wear off. It worked for me!",

    "question": "I am taking 75mg of lyrica I tried it ages ago I felt like it didn't work on my pain and the side effects were bad I was sleepy, confused, foggy, forgetful, drunk like + more so I stopped taking it. Now that my bulging disc's have turned into herniated disc's I'm in a lot of pain so I got out lyrica again to try and got the same effects during the day I didn't like it. I took it last night and got the same side effects again but my pain has improved quite a bit. Should I keep trying it or just go to my ddoctors",
