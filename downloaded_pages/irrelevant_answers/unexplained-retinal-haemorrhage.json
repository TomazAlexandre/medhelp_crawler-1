    "question": "I'm a healthy male of 26.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not hugely active but I have no physical health problems, and I'm a healthy weight for my height (BMI of 19).\u00a0\u00a0Last Thursday evening I noticed a small black spot in the peripheral vision of my right eye: in the bottom right corner.\u00a0\u00a0It was present on Friday, and on Saturday I saw an optomerist.\u00a0\u00a0He gave me a full exam and took photographs of the back of my eye using new technology.\u00a0\u00a0The photos were very healthy and my eyesight was very good (only a prescription of -0.25 for sphere and cylinder on both eyes).When he dilated my pupils with drops and used an ophthalmoscope he was able to see a small retinal haemorrhage in the area I'd described.\u00a0\u00a0He told me he wasn't overly worried, but couldn't give a reason as to why it happened.\u00a0\u00a0He said it could just be \"one of those things\".\u00a0\u00a0He referred me to a specialist eye clinic, and I went there today.Two doctors examined my eye and although they could see the haemorrhage - leakage from which is already starting to be reabsorbed - but neither could give me a reason as to why it might have happened.\u00a0\u00a0The more experienced dr found it very strange that this would have happened spontaneously and without any trauma.\u00a0\u00a0They told me they weren't overly worried and sent me away.What could cause something like this to happen? From reading online, it would seem that common causes are either high blood pressure (which they checked, and was fine), diabetes, and trauma.\u00a0\u00a0I saw my family doctor this afternoon who also wasn't worried, given my age and general health; but she did agree to a diabetes test.\u00a0\u00a0She didn't think it was likely I have diabetes, given that I'm displaying no other symptoms.I'm reluctant to dismiss this as \"one of those things\" because I'm worried it's caused by something underlying.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
