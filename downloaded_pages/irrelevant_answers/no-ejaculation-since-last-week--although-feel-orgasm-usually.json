    "question": "Hello, I am writing becasue I am concerned about a problem whihc started a few days ago. Firstly, I am a 22 year old male.I masturbate daily, and engage in sexual intercourse weekly.\u00a0\u00a0Until about 7 days ago I had no problems.For the last 7 days my penis seems somewhat dead, although I can still achieve an errection it does not seem as strong.\u00a0\u00a0Also I find it harder to obtain an errection.\u00a0\u00a0When I get an errection going, I have been experiencing dry orgasm's meaning that I am unable to ejaculate.\u00a0\u00a0WHile masturbating I notice that the pre-ejaculate is still present.\u00a0\u00a0I read a lot about this and believe it can be regrograde ejaculation, however I haven not really noticed a change in the color of my urine.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, I have been having some pain on the right lower abdomen, slightly above the groin area.\u00a0\u00a0The pain seems dull and not strong.I have visited my family doctor twice since and he believes it might be a groin pull or another injury while lifting weights at the gym.\u00a0\u00a0he did a urine sample which came out normal.\u00a0\u00a0I talked to him about the ejaculation issue, he said he believes ill be fine in a month and hasn't even heard of retrograde ejaculation.\u00a0\u00a0However im still worried since I am very young and do not want sexual problems at such an early age.IN the past everytime i had an orgasm i would ejaculate.\u00a0\u00a0However in teh past 4 months there have been about 3 times where I didnt, ejaculate but I always ejaculated the next time I masturbated.\u00a0\u00a0HOwever the last 7 days I have been completely unable to ejaculate.My question is, do you think I should seek immediate help for this particular issue, or do u think my fmaily doctor is right, with a rest for about a month he says ill be okay.",
