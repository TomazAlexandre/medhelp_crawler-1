            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Hope these tips help. Take care!",

    "question": "Some days I feel okay but most of the time I feel really tired and have no energy, I also get a lot of headaches and feel nauseous most of the time. I take multivitamins and am also on anti depressants but I don't think either of those would be making me feel sick because I have been taking them for a long time. I'm just not sure what could be causing me to feel like this? any ideas?",
