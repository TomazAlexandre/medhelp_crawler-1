            "answer": "Hi,I agree that some of your symptoms may be coming from your anxiety/anti-depressant medications, but also from elevated blood sugars. Most people have those symptoms related to their diabetes when sugars are very high, often above 300. The best way to find out is to begin testing yourself. Start with a fasting check before you eat in the mornings, and 1-2 hours after you eat. Definitely check it when you are having blurred vision. If the numbers are high(above 140) speak with your doctor. If they are above 200, you should contact your doctor urgently.Take care.",

The blurred vision might also be from the Anxiety pills, have u read the pamplet that comes with the med's and red the side affects? And if your GP is refusing u diabetic test like A1C's or glucose test, buy your own Glucose monitor, Walmart has a brand that is cheap and in some places the One Touch ultra have been on sale, I just got the mini colored one for 14.99. Ask your dr, to give u a precription for the strip it will save u alot of money. And then test yourself and see if your BS is higher than normal\u00a0\u00a0when u have these symptom. I'm not a doctor but I am betting its your Med's. And yes to the question of stress can cause BS to rise higher, and can make u urinate more too. But check it from the Dr or yourself...",

    "question": "I am a confirmed pre diabetic male, overweight, (grandmother , mother and brother ), I recently went through a very high stress level and subequently lost a significant amount of weight , blurred vision. I have been on a heavy thirst binge, frequent urination. I read where stress can trigger early on set symptoms, But is a certain blood sugar level required to link these symptoms or can stress make them kick in earlier as described ? My GP is refusing to link these symptoms due to pre diabetic sugar levels\u00a0\u00a0and I am clearly living the symptoms . I am also on Anti depressants and anti anxiety medicines. Do they effect as well?",
