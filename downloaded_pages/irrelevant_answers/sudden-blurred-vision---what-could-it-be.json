    "question": "Hi,I am not sure if this is the correct forum in which to post my question/symptoms, but I will try anyway. In the last 2 days, I have suddenly gained blurred vision. If I look at things far away, I can see things fairly ok. But anything within a couple of feet suddenly become blurred and it is a real effort just to see.Prior to this, although I wore corrective lenses for a weak eye muscle, I have had really good vision.I am thinking that it could be connected to the fact that I was outside in the sun for about 6 hours on Saturday. I wore sunglasses, but I am wondering if they were not very good and I could have sustained some eye damage because of it.What do you think this could be?",
