            "answer": "I have gestational diabetes\u00a0\u00a0it's scary but if u do have it ur Dr's will watch u very closely I'm 34 weeks as soon as I found out at 28 wks I had to see an endocrinologist for my sugar they gave me a meter to monitor my sugar levels I also had to go see a dietician so I could learn what would spike my sugar and how much of what is ok .. I'm also on metformin 850 2 times a day I have to call my endocrinologist every 2 weeks to report my numbers so if my sugar is getting higher he can adjust my meds since 32wks I see my OB wkly for ultra sounds and non stress tests. It can Increase ur risks but when you work w ur Dr's to keep ur sugar levels and diet under control ur risks are then just as high as anyone else's. Also there's lots of ppl that fail the 1hr and pass the 3 good luck momma try not to stress",

I was borderline w my first so they couldn't say I had it so I didn't watch my diet or anything when he was born he had extremely low blood sugar and they had to monitor him closely. . Fingers crossed my baby doesn't have that problem this time since I'm being monitored. . Other wise I think everything will be ok",
