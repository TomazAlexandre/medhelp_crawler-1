            "answer": "Most doctors recommend that type 1 diabetics drink only small amounts, and the amount that I read is most often 1 drink. The problem is not only that it lowers glucose but also that alcohol affects the liver's ability to respond to low glucose. So if you happen to drop low after drinking, your body is less able to release its stores of emergency sugars to help you avoid serious hypoglycemia. If you have had enough alcohol that you are unable to notice that you are low or rationally treat hypoglycemia, you can have severe problems. Any lows are thought by people around you to just be the effects of alcohol and you can be left to sleep it off, going into unconsciousness.",

            "answer": "I frankly would not use alcohol to lower a high level... unlike a precise dose of insulin, you can't predict exactly what will happen. I have personally been in touch with too many young adults and teens suffering with awful complications like gastroparesis and diabetic cataracts -- yes, already happening in their teens and early 20's -- to think that it is ever OK to let a high level remain high. It is SO important to lower it as soon as you discover the high level, and I can't stress that enough! I have had these people write to me (through the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) and say that they would give ANYTHING to be able to go back and re-do their control now to prevent the complications.So if you decide to drink, make sure you have friends around you who AREN'T drunk who know what to do if you go low, and don't wait to see if the alcohol is going to lower the sugar levels. Correct first, and then drink very carefully if you must drink. Test often while drinking and make sure you never lose the ability to make the decision about whether you need insulin or sugar. It's tough, I know, but so important that you keep your facilities about you and the glucose levels under control. Years later, when you are free of complications and your doctors are wondering how you turned out to be so fortunate, you will be so glad you didn't completely give your brain up to have a fun evening.I know from personal experience that this is true. Never, ever give up your own responsibility for your health, not for anything. If you choose to drink, do it smartly and in moderation, for your nerves and eyes and kidneys are essential to a quality life. You can have fun, but you must take full charge of your health.I don't mean to preach. I really don't. All I am advocating is to keep your senses clear. I think we must do that at all times. Never, ever leave a high reading high, thinking to correct it later.",
