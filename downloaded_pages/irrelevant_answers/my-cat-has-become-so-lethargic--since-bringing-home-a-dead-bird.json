            "answer": "Hi Kniki,My cat brought back 2 mice & a bird- Its was alive & flapping round the house (don't worry we took it to a rescue centre!).We realised that, that the days she bought them back she didn't have her bell on..!We said to her no but still stroked her to say thank you... Because it\u2019s a gift & in cat world they are showing that they can provide for you too.!!Since then she has brought back gloves, painting roller & sponges.!!!I think it\u2019s just a little faze...Good luck..!!",

            "answer": "My mom's cat just passed away after being lethargic for only a day.\u00a0\u00a0I've done a little research and it seems that it could be due to liver failure.\u00a0\u00a0One place I read it could be leukemia.\u00a0\u00a0But wherever I looked, it was something serious and the cat only lived a few days.\u00a0\u00a0I also saw a neighbor's cat with diabetes, which left untreated could also lead to death after a few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The best thing to do is take him to the vet, unless he's really old and ready to pass.",

    "question": "My cat bought home a dead bird yesterday, the third one in a week. He has become very slow and lethargic.. I don't want to take him to the vets, because i am constantly there. In his five years he has been treated for abscess's. A flat foot, from a collision.. Also a split tongue, from god only knows..He is generally a lively, impatient cat, but now he is very wary about his footing..How can i stop him eating birds? and should i take him for yet another visit, to the vets?",
