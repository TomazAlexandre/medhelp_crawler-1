            "answer": "You have been Type II (I assume) for 13 years and your disease may have progressed. I'm assuing that at one time your management was working better? On the other hand your comment about not \"getting what you're measuring and exactly how what you eat affects my level\" makes me wonder if you have not learned diabetes management. You most certainly need to learn about carb counting and how food affects your blood sugar by trying different foods and then testing two hours later.You say you are on Lantus (basal insulin). If your numbers are consistently high after eating you are likely needing to go on a basal/bolus regimen and learn how to develop an insulin: carb ratio to suit your mealtime (bolus) dose to what you eat. John Walsh's book Using Insulin is excellent. 80 is not a low blood sugar but if you are used to being high then it can feel like it is.",

            "answer": "Zoelula gave you some excellent advice. I would add that there are a number of mid & upper body exercises you can do that would help you burn off some those carbs. Please try and see an exercise specialist or physical therapy advisor. Any amount of exercise, especially after meals will help.I will also share a little piece of advice that I got from a diabetes specialist many years ago. He said to \"eat the fruit don't drink the fruit juice\" and he referred me to a food nutrionist to help me establish a good diabetic diet.Good Luck,troytroy",
