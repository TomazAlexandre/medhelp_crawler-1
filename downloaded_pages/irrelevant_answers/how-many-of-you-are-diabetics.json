            "answer": "Hi Im Phyllis and my husband recently had a stroke and he is Type 2. His on Lantus.He had his stroke on June 13 and it had effected his speech only and has a little swelling in his brain. He got discharged on the 26 of June but 2 nights ago I had rushed him to the hospital he had mild chest pains but it disappered when we got there. They did more tests and may have found a partial blockage in a artery that is in his lower heart. So we are seeing a cardiology on Monday....It is a scary feeling he is only 43 years old. Hope to hear from you soon. And can you tell me what were you feeling the time of your TIA and how do you feel today.",
