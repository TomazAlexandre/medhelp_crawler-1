            "answer": "You've stumped ME on this one. Usually if you are both treated, the problem is resolved. Why this happens ONLY after oral is the real mystery. Do the doctors not have ANY idea why this may be?Has your b/f seen a urologist to determine if HE has an infection that is resistant to the antibiotics? Have you both had oral cultures done to see what grows?Have you ever JUST had oral sex so you know for absolute certain the infection has to be spread orally? How about kissing with no sex?I wish there was a specialist I could recommend you both talk with, but I honestly don't know who that would be. I'd start with your OB/GYN......if he/she can't figure it out, I'm guessing they will know where to send you.I wish you the best..........must be a real drag!PeaceGreenlydia",
