            "answer": "\"SOULD\u00a0\u00a0i be concerned with this one high reading\"Absolutely. Read carefully ALL nutrition labels. Look for hidden sugars such as carb sugars which are listed as grams. Every 7 grams equals one HEAPING Tablespoon of refined sugar. For example, if you used bottled spaghetti sauce it could contain as much as 40 grams of carb sugar plus 4 grams of sugar per serving. This would equate to 6.25 Tablespoons of sugar per serving! Some wheat pasta are high in carbs and/or contain added sugar to enhance the flavor. At first glance wheat pasta may look good and sound good but if the nutrition label says otherwise it is harming you.\"are these #s good enough to stay off the meds.\"If your preprandial is 80-90 that is normal. However, the foods you're eating are jacking up your levels. This is where you need to focus your lifestyle change. Levels of 130-140 postprandial for non-diabetic is high, and levels of plus 200 for anyone is causing you harm.If you need direction on foods to avoids and which foods to concentrate on they have been posted numerous times on the Diabetes - Adult Type II forum, or you can send me a PM.",

    "question": "After my last post I have been taking my bs readings before dinner and 2 hours after dinner, they been running in the 80s to mid 90s before and 130 to 140 after. I think this seems in target range, but today before dinner it was 86 and 2 hours later it was 210, never this high before. I did have a nice helping of whole wheat noodles with spag sauce and a small slice\u00a0\u00a0of bread. Was it the meal. SOULD\u00a0\u00a0i be concerned with this one high reading, are these #s good enough to stay off the meds. thanks for your help, I am still learning.",
