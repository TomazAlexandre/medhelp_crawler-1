            "answer": "My endo doesn't test T3, T4, or anything else but TSH, so don't know my T3 number!!!! My last TSH test was 1, but I'm still having hypo symtoms, though symptoms are milder than when my tsh high. I'm wondering if it's possible that I also need T3 med, not just synthroid (T4). Is it possible to have a TSH of 1 and be deficient in T3???? I don't even know\u00a0\u00a0why my endo. doesn't think it's worth testing T3. He basically said my TSH was normal now, come back in 6 months. Time to find a new endo!!! I'm wondering if I have a T3 problem, because w/ TSH at 1, I'm still having hypo symtoms. I have hashimotos hypothyroid. All my other labs and normal. Any thoughts? (thanks!)",

            "answer": "Thyroid medications are not a 100 percent cure all.\u00a0\u00a0However, once levels are back to normal and stable for a while you should expect most of your symptoms to subside. The ones that are left might be from other health conditions that have the same symptoms a thyroid symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Or, you just might have to treat each symptom separately and from thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it takes time to heal once levels are normal and stable, depending on how long you were with thyroid condition before being diagnosed and how severe your thyroid condition.The FTs should be checked at least once in a while.Diagnosed with Hashi by antibodies or by the FTs.A TSH of 1 is recommended level. I wish mine was that good.",

            "answer": "Thanks!! In the past year I have been examined by: neurologist, orthopedist, ophthalmologist, Ob/gyn, endocrinologist and primary care MD, etc. and I've taken NUMEROUS blood tests, exams, scans, films, etc and none of these doctors or tests ever finds anything wrong w/ me except hashimotos hypothyroid!!!!! I've been told that I do NOT have diabetes, lyme, lupus, rheum disorder, no lesions, no back/disc problems, etc. -- About 3 weeks ago my TSH came back at 1. I was shocked because I still have lots of symptoms and NOTHING else can ever be found to be the cause!!!\u00a0\u00a0I don't have a stressful life (besides coping w/ my new thyroid illness and symptoms), I eat well, take vitamins, exercise and get plenty of sleep, and I'm only 40, so I'm at a loss as to WHY I still have heart palps, constipation (I eat lots of fiber and now MOST take metamucil, endo told hypo causes constip. - but w/ TSH of 1, I'm not really hypo any more....right?), I have tingling in my feet, I developed carpal tunnel shortly after hypo dx (even though none of my hand/writs activities have changed). Endo kept telling me I'd feel better at TSH of 1. I do feel an improvement, but I also still have LOTS of the same symptoms!! Now I'm wondering if I'll always feel this way!\u00a0\u00a0--My Endo NEVER tested T3 and said that he only treats by TSH number!! I know I need to find a new endo, But I'm wondering if it's possible to have a bad/low/out of whack T3 reading when TSH is at 1????\u00a0\u00a0Is that even possible???",
