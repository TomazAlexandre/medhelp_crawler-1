            "answer": "Sorry to read about your shocks. Here is a group dealing specifically with being zapped by the defibrillator, http://www.zaplife.org/.Here is my experience:I was fitted with the device 4 months ago. A month later the device gave me 13 shocks in a\u00a0\u00a0space of\u00a0\u00a03-5 minutes. I was fully awake and helpless but since this happened in a public place, I was able to call an ambulance.immediately. I have been OK since then except for the device being recalled by the manufacturer !! Currently I\u00a0\u00a0am working ,driving 100 miles a day daily and also dealing with severe diabetes, mild heart failure and thyroid disorder.I would advice you to try to put this incident behind you otherwise it will be difficult to lead a \"normal\" life. Please schedule an appointment with your electrophysiologist. who\u00a0\u00a0can reprogram your device if you had an \"inappropriate\" shock.Good luck",

            "answer": "Hang in there. My advice\u00a0\u00a0is try to lead a normal life as much as you can but never get complacent. Do take your medications on time.My EP originally prescribed a low dose of B-blocker which may have contributed to 13 shocks. Now he has drastically increased the dose The consequence of that is that I don't get signals when I am low on sugar (hypoglycemia). Previously I used to feel edgy when blood glucose went low but now the b-blockers keep me relaxed all the time. My solution to get around that problem (potentially life threatening)\u00a0\u00a0is to do more frequent blood glucose testing even in the miiddle of the night.Thanks.",

    "question": "Is their a support group I can turn to for my fear of my defib going off again.\u00a0\u00a0It has discharged twice in 6 months, each time in excess of 30 joles.\u00a0\u00a0They were extremely painful and disturbing.\u00a0\u00a0Now I find it impossible to sleep or to be in a quiet place, all I hear and think about is my heartbeats and when is it going to shock me again.\u00a0\u00a0I have had congestive heart failure, a heart attack and was shot in 1980.\u00a0\u00a0I have been through a lot but nothing has bothered me like my last shock.\u00a0\u00a0I need to discuss this with someone that has had this terrible experience.Thank you,Smitty",
