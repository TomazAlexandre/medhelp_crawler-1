            "answer": "My bottle of Humolag has 10ml--which means there are 500 units of insulin in the bottle.\u00a0\u00a01ml=100 units of insulin. This is written on the bottle, maybe if you take a good look at the bottle it could help.\u00a0\u00a0 I am a little unclear as to why you don't know amount of insulin per day, so I am not sure if I answered your question.\u00a0\u00a0I give myself about 21 units of insulin per day--13 units of Lantus and a sliding scale of Humalog between 6-10 units--depending on how many carbohydrates I have eaten--So, it takes me about 2-3 months to use a bottle of Humalog and the Lantus would take longer, but I must open a new bottle every month for consistency issues.\u00a0\u00a0Does that help?",
