            "answer": "Hello,Yes insulin can cause itching of the body. Insulin injection not only can cause an itchy small, hard red area at the injection site but a\u00a0\u00a0generalized allergy to insulin causes rashes and itchy skin over other parts of the body. Usually, this disappears by itself. If the itching continues, then other insulins that you are not allergic to can be tried.I feel that if you are having itcy parts of the skin after insulin use,then it is necessary to discuss it with your endocrinologist.Hope it helps.Take care and regards.",
