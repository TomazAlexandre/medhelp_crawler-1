    "question": "I had my HIV antibodies test done today and i will go in 3 or 4 days to get the results. It is now 8 weeks post exposure{protected vaginal sex but at some point condom slipped off} since then here is a list of my symptoms. Exactly one month after exposure i had sore throat, diarrhea, nausea,fatigue. I had to go to the hospital for that. 2 weeks later my acid reflux flared up for the first time after 4 years, extreme fatigue, generalized itching with no rash, inability to sweat, burning sensations in feet and arms. I tested for diabetes,thyroid, and liver disease and all came back normal. However my blood count showed low hemoglobin and low hemotacrit. Doctor said blood test will show what is the cause of my anemia. It was my only sexual encounter in my life and if i could i would take it back. PLEASE WISH ME LUCK AS I GET MY RESULTS IN 3 TO 4 DAYS. P.S. IS IT POSSIBLE TO GET RESULTS IN 3 DAYS? I ASKED GIRL IF SHE HAD ANY STDS AND SHE SAID NO. I HAVENT SPOKEN TO HER SINCE.",
