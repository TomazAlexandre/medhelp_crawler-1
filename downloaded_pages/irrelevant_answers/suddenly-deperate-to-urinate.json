            "answer": "Hello,Most bladder control problems happen when muscles are too weak or too active. If bladder muscles become too active, you may feel a strong urge to go to the bathroom when you have little urine in your bladder. This is urge incontinence or overactive bladder. There are other causes of incontinence, such as prostate problems and nerve damage. Treatment depends on the type of problem you have and what best fits your lifestyle.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply.I don;t think it is prostate or urge incontinence though. The bladder was full, when I urinated there was more than 500 ml so I really did need to urinate rather than the sensation of needing to alone. The fact that the urine was completely clear also made me think something had gone wrong with my electrolytes perhaps.I have had kidney stones twice, both times passed in a day or so. I've had ultrasound kidney scan and x ray and am told there are no moe stones. Last occurance was in 2007.",

            "answer": "Hello,Other causes which need to be ruled out are diabetes, glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diuretic drugs and pregnancy.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography , pregnancy blood test, thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "On occasion (twice in 6 months) I have found nyself absolutely deperate to urinate after just having been. This happened today, I emptied my bladder no problem but by the time I got to work (15 mons away) I was absolutely desperate. The urine was completely clear and lots of it.I had to go to the loo a few more times this morning then everything settled down. At the same time as this I started getting palpitations and wondered if there is some sort of connection.I did not drink any alcohol for several days, didnt drink any coffee or caffeine drinks, just fizzy water. My weight is 4 lb less tonight than it was this morning too.Does anyone have any ideas what could have caused this and how to avoid it happening again.",
