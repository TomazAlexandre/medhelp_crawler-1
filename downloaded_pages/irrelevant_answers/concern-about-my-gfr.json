            "answer": "Hi!A single estimated glomerular filtration rate (e-GFR) reading is of not much significance. Normal GFR is around 100 mL/min/1.73 m2.\u00a0\u00a0GFR lower than 100 persisting for 3 months is considered as chronic kidney disease (CKD). If you have diabetes, keep it under strict control. Eat healthy. Drink 6-8 glasses of water every day and exercise. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
