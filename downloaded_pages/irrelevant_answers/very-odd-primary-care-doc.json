            "answer": "Some primary care doctors are not comfortable prescribing anything when someone is pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I had a primary care that would not order an ultrasound of my heart when I was pregnant with my last baby.\u00a0\u00a0At the time, my insurance restrictions made it impossible for my OB-GYN to order the test.\u00a0\u00a0It was very frustrating, and as soon as my insurance changed, I switched to a new primary care.Talk to your OB-GYN ASAP.\u00a0\u00a0You need to make sure your diabetes is under control.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to him/her about the rash as well.\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy can cause a lot of weird things to happen to our bodies!!!If you're not happy with your primary care doctor, start looking for a new one.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that she's uncomfortable with prescribing things while your pregnant is somewhat understandable but her sarcasm in stating \"that's why they get paid the big bucks,\" is unprofessional and unnecessary.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe she was trying to be funny but I don't find it amusing.To me, my primary care doctor is the most important doctor in my life.\u00a0\u00a0She's the one that knows what's going on with everything and is the one that I trust.\u00a0\u00a0She sees the big picture.\u00a0\u00a0You want someone who you are confident in and handles things when she can and refers out when she can't.Best of luck and let us know what happened.\u00a0\u00a0You also may want to post in the pregnancy forum and/or in the diabetes forum to get more responses.",

            "answer": "I seen my ob/gyn today and she was wondering the same thing as me.. WTH? She said that she was wrong, that a primary is supposed to be the one prescribing the diabetic supplies but she said don't worry she would give me everything I needed. She also said that it is supposed to be a team, which is what made perfect sense. A team of people helping me get through the pregnancy, controlling sugars, and chronic pain. Luckily I have the BEST and caring ob/gyn around these parts and I would gladly sacrifice a primary for this woman she really is a good woman. She makes me feel so good about having good sugars and even told me that I am strong and doing a great job. My high risk Dr usually tells me things like \"140 is too high!!\" or \"the baby will come out too big and have problems!!\" lol I know it is forthe best but man, I am glad I have a Dr that uplifts me when the other Drs are giving me the ugly truth lol I am gonig to stick with my ob/gyn as my primary until I have the baby and then go get another primary Dr. That lady was a witch, I couldn't believe she actually said.. \"Go get the scripts from them, they get paid the big bucks\"... I feel bad for whomever she cares for on a regular basis. I will be getting the RF test done next week. I had labs done today to see my A1C levels and liver screening or something. Thanks for the insight all!",

    "question": "I went to see a Dr today because I am Diabetic. I just switched insurances and it was the first time being see in this clinic and by this Dr. She told me that she would not prescribe me my Insulin, test strips, syringes, or anything else because I am 6 months pregnant and it is my ob/gyn that is suppsed to be doing that. WTH???? I never in my life ever heard of that is this normal? She told me I shouldn't be seeing her for my Diabetes and to be seen by the ob/gyn to manage it.. Should I go to another Dr?? I asked her to test me for the Rheumatoid factor and also a liver test because I was getting weird rashes that I know wasn't puppps and she said no, I need to do all that with my ob/gyn that's why they get paid the \"big bucks\". I felt really helpless and wanted to cry.. why would she do this?",
