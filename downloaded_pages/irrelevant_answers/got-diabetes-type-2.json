            "answer": "Many of us with hepatitis C, even those of us who are cured, are dealing with type 2 diabetes. Losing weight and eating low carb is very helpful. My doctor put me on metformin which dropped my fasting blood sugar closer to normal range. But the thing that helped the most was cutting way down on carbs and losing 10 pounds. My A1C went from 6.0 to 5.6.",

            "answer": "Bobbie, you did not mention your BMI. I looked up your profile and don't see your weight but I noticed weight management and weight reduction surgery among your interests. Usually, when extra weight is a factor, the reason for type 2 diabetes is high levels of free fatty acids and triglycerides in the blood (they interfere with glucose absorption in muscle cells).The only sure way to lower the levels of fatty acids and triglycerides in the blood is to get rid of excess body fat. Then muscle cells will be able to feed on glucose unimpeded and this will lead to its lower level in the blood.",
