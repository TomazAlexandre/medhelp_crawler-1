    "question": "I have gestational diabetes and was sent for an ultrasound to check on the size of my baby. I was told at my last scan (28w) that he was bigger than average. Today's scan showed he is roughly about 5lb 9oz (give or take 400gs just incase). How spot on were all your birth weights compared to the doctors estimates?? I'm currently 36weeks.",
