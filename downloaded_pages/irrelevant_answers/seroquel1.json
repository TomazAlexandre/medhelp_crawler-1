            "answer": "Hi everyone. I am quitting seroquel, and I was wondering if you could help me. I was put on 1200 mg's nightly dose; for about a year. I am currently taking 600 mg nightly; trying to taper off this medication so i can regain my ability to feel emotions again. I feel like a zombie. In the beginning it helped me by stabilizing my mood, and helping me sleep.\u00a0I discovered that the numbing affect, and other side affects like weight gain, and acid reflux was something I don't like at all. I want to be natural, and healthy. I am concerned with the diabetes threat also. I was hoping to transcend medications; and only do vitamins, good diet, exercise, etc..Questions:1) How long does my brain take to feel emotions again after I stop this medication ? I am wondering if being on it for such a long time has permanently affected my brains ability to return to natural functionality. Any insight you can give based on your experience would be very helpful.2) Can a person's dopamine, and serotonin receptors become unblocked after quitting ? How long does the detox take ?Thanks everyone for your input.",

            "answer": "Hi and welcome! This is a really old thread (from 2007!) that you are posting on, so these folks are probably not around anymore. If you go to the top of the page and hit the orange 'post a question' link you can tell your story and start your own thread. It will help you to get more responses and hopefully the answers and support you need. I don't have any personal experience with Seroquel, but I do know a little about it, especially the notorious side effects. How long have you been taking this med, and what was it prescribed for? Also, are you working with your doctor to taper off?",
