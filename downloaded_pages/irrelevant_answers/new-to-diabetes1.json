            "answer": "Diabetes type 2 is reversible.\u00a0\u00a0You will be given two choices, either continue increasing dosage of medication to control your blood sugar, from a few pills a day to one day injecting yourself with insulin, or you can adopt a way of eating that will naturally keep your blood sugar low and steady and ween yourself off medications completely.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, big pharma would rather keep you on the increasing meds journey, but reversing and cancelling type 2 diabetes is very possible, I have done it myself.\u00a0\u00a0Today is a cross roads for you, it's your choice....do you want to allow your diabetes to progress, or do you want to cancel it.Adopting a diet called LCHF will help cancel your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This is a low carb, moderate protein and high fats (from natural sources) diet which will help you control blood sugar and satisfy your hunger (and eliminate diabetes from your life).\u00a0\u00a0Eliminate all starchy stuff, like all grains, pasta, bread, rice, potatoes, beans, and eliminate sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Eat non starchy veg frequently, while limiting fruits to occasional treats.\u00a0\u00a0Don't\u00a0\u00a0drink fruit juice-it's just liquid sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Don't be shy with good fats (avocado, grass fed butter, olive oil, nuts, etc), and stay away from fake fats like margarine.\u00a0\u00a0Opt for high omega 3 fats, like salmon, avocado, butter, and stay away from omega 6 fats ( sun flower, grape seed, etc).\u00a0\u00a0High omega 6 fats cause inflammation in body and promotes diabetic conditions/symptoms as well as causing pain in joints.\u00a0\u00a0At every meal, eat non starchy veg with meat/fish/eggs, and don't be shy with fats (butter, olive oil, bacon, avocado, etc).\u00a0\u00a0Stay away from sugar and low fat or no fat processed foods. Eat whole foods as much as possible, and not the processed stuff.\u00a0\u00a0Eat full fat dairy, and stay away from low fat or no fat dairy.\u00a0\u00a0Don't eat low fat or no fat yogurt, as it has same effect as candy in your body.\u00a0\u00a0You will be amazed how well this way of eating will stabilize your blood sugar and remove diabetic condition.Try it for one week...you will be amazed at the results. You will see your blood sugar go down and stay down naturally.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hello,with blood sugars that high, I hope you have been tested for type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If oral meds do not bring your blood sugars down then you will need insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin always works, but oral meds can only work if your pancreas is still working.You are going to need to learn a lot about diabetes and it's management.\u00a0\u00a0low carb diet,, exercise, weight management will all go a long way to helping control sugars.\u00a0\u00a0oral meds and or insulin will likely also be required.Know that normal blood sugars are typically < 140 at all times.\u00a0\u00a0Fasting blood sugar should be < 95.\u00a0\u00a0It is very important that you get your sugars down as close to normal as you can.Please ask questions, if we can help.",
