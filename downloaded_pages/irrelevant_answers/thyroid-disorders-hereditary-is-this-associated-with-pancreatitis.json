    "question": "Okay, I was wondering because a friend of mine has shown symptoms of hyperthyroidism, after I had done some research, and I plan on urging them to get this checked out. I also know that this person's father has pancreatitis. I read that thyroid disorders can be hereditary. Do you think that this has anything to do with the possible hyperthyroidism, the association between pancreatitis and thyroid disorders? I can't find much about it. And are thyroid disorders linked with diabetes? Is pancreatitis linked with diabetes as well?Thank you for your time, I appreciate it.",
