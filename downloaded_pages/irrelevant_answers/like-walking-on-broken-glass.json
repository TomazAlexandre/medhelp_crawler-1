            "answer": "I know what you are feeling,it's called Peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0It means that the coating on the nerves of your feet is being destroyed and this causes the nerves to flare in pain.\u00a0\u00a0The numbness is part of all this.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds ridiculous that you have both pain and numbness doesn't it.\u00a0\u00a0I have PN, mine is inherited and not from Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It is very common to have Peripheral neuropathy if you are Diabetic,in fact it was a commercial describing the kinds of pain that clued me into my own problem.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor doesn't know about PN, ask him for a referral to a neurologist or an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Either one would be able to help you.\u00a0\u00a0I have a GP who is very knowledgeable so you can't ever tell.\u00a0\u00a0If one drug doesn't work there are others.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that you find a good doctor.",
