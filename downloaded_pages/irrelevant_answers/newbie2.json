            "answer": "First of all, make sure the endocrinologist specializes in thyroids - most only deal with diabetes.There is a lot of controversy about Armour on this site.\u00a0\u00a0Many who swear by it, some who refuse to take it.\u00a0\u00a0Personally I have found that a synthetic levothyroxine (Synthroid) works best for me.\u00a0\u00a0I have met some doctors who don't like prescribing desiccated thyroid for many reasons (fear of consistence between batches; fear of zoonotic diseases, etc.)\u00a0\u00a0 It's something that you will have to discuss with your endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0 I'd suggest that you research all of the options so you have some good information to discuss.\u00a0\u00a0I've found that if you go in prepared the doctor will understand that you are taking this seriously and (perhaps) they can't just brush you off.\u00a0\u00a0:-)All the diet, exercise, and supplements won't help your thyroid function return to normal.Good luck with all of this.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing to be scared about - you're just taking charge of your health.",

            "answer": "I see why you are fearful. Utah has a solid point. Synthetic Synthyoid - Generic or Armour.\u00a0\u00a0When I first required medication I never even knew there was so many choices. I went on the most prescribed drug choice Synthroid. I was on it for over 4 years. It wasn't right for me - or the doctors I had at the time weren't following me close enough. I am not sure.Recently I had to start all over. I found a new doctor who is a MD only. After 4 years of feeling completely \"off\" I suggested trying Armour. He agreed which is very rare. Most doctors choose the synthetic over desiccated. 2months and the Armour has given me back some of what I had.I suppose : Make sure you are comfortable with your doctor. Make sure he/she is intrested in helping you - and again in agreement with Utah, make sure your doctor gets the whole thyroid thing.Go on the meds - which ever one. You won't know what works best for you until you try. You'll know when you start feeling better after a while - but be patient. It takes a long time to understand and get balanced. I know how you feel about the whole med thing. I never had any Rx until this. It depresses you at first - but you have to get past that and look at it as your way to feeling better.You asked about what you should not agree to. I suppose no one has that answer for you at this time because nothing has been suggested yet except taking medication. Right? Your best bet is to go to your appointment, see what your doctors says, and if your confused - check back here.Everyone gets scared when a new chapter like this opens up. I wish you the best and stay in touch. Many here are very knowledgeable and can answer some questions as they come up.",

    "question": "I'll be meeting with an Endocrenologist for the first time as soon as my OB/GYN sends in the referral.\u00a0\u00a0I'm scared.\u00a0\u00a0It seems so many Drs still think 5.0 is the high side of normal and are reluctant to try Armour.\u00a0\u00a0 Of course, I have no idea what my Dr will be like, but I want to be prepared.\u00a0\u00a0I have all the symptoms except my nails, hair, and skin are uneffected.\u00a0\u00a0Fatigue, foggy head, depression, cold, constipation, etc...I have.\u00a0\u00a0My lastest TSH was 7.6.\u00a0\u00a0I've had high TSH for a few years, but am just now dealing with the fact that I can't tackle this through diet, exercise, supplements, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I've probably waited too long, but I really didn't want to have to go on meds.\u00a0\u00a0I'm tired of being tired, so I'm giving in.\u00a0\u00a0What should I be sure to ask my Dr. and what should I absolutely not agree to.",
