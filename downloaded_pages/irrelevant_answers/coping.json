            "answer": "I totally agree with the answer you were given. We hope he does not have diabetes, but it is smart to not ignore symptoms and to get checked. It is such an easy disease to diagnose, and compared to many, it is easy to live with. Yes, there are the daily needs to check blood sugar and to eat properly, but the result can be a very long, healthy life. You are wise to try to educate yourself. This really IS the first step. If he turns out to have type 1 diabetes, contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (www.jdrg.org) for information: they would be happy to send you printed materials, or you can download info from their website. If type 2 diabetes is the issue, you will find more appropriate info on the American Diabetes Association's website at www.ada.org",
