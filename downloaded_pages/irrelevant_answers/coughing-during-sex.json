    "question": "My problem is similar to the previous poster. I am 68 yrs old with the usual middle age problems. Controlled diabetes, controlled high blood pressure, acid reflux and heart disease. I went to the doctor with this problem 2 years ago. He order a stress test which I failed. 4 stents later I was pronounced cured. Unfortunately, this symptom persists. As I near orgasm it feels as though I am getting fluid in my lungs and begin coughing up very thin clear mucus. This can continue for up to 1/2 hr. My breathing is fine but it is a very unpleasaant experience. My GP is stumped. I have found that if I sit up rather than being on my back, the reaction is greatly reduced. I havw suspected that it has something to do with the vagus nerve because I now pass my stress test and have always been able to do cardio stress stuff without a problem. Seeing as how the previous poster's note is 10 yrs old I thought I'd check and see if there has been any progress in this area.This discussion is related to/posts/show/870242.",
