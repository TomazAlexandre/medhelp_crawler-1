            "answer": "Hello Arkylady,You are a good soul to be caring for your mother; please also take care of yourself!Small juice boxes are easy to keep with you, in a pocket or purse, and they keep a long time. Those little Juicy Juice apple-juice boxes, designed for preschoolers, are perfect. When my daughter gets low, she typically starts with juice or some Coke, and then \"backs it up\" with a little something to eat, so her sugar won't dive back down after a quick juice burst. A small granola bar or a few crackers works.Please consider seeing an endocrinologist/diabetes specialist as soon as possible. He or she should be able to help you get better control of your blood sugar, and can give you specific advice about what your goal blood sugars should be before going to sleep at night.Good luck and take care.",

    "question": "I am having problems keeping my blood sugar levels under control. I care for my 80 year old mother who has Alzheimer's and am often very stressed and it goes up. My levels are more often too high but on occasion drop too low when I don't eat properly or am overly active. I woke up one night to go to the restroom and actually fell out in the floor. I could not get up. I was extremely weak and dizzy, nauseated and felt and acted like someone extremely drunk. I couldn't even hold my head up. This was before my Mom's disease progressed and she went to a neighbor's for help.She and I are usually alone and she can no longer use the phone or remember people. If I pass out and it is some time before help arrives am I in danger of dieing or having a stroke? I have found that when my sugar is too low I usually sleep very sound. I am afraid I will not wake up or will awaken but can't get help. If I fall like beofre I couldn't even get to the phone, much less dial it. What can I do? I keep orange juice on hand but might not be able to get to it. Is there anything easy to use that I could carry with me? I am never thinking clearly at these times and usually don't realize my sugar is low before it becomes a problem. I would appreciate anyone's suggestions.",
