            "answer": "It is highly likely that you have a fungal infection called Thrush.You can buy an antifungal cream specifically for the genital area from the pharmacy without a prescription (Canesten in the UK), the pharmacist can advise you which product to buy if you are in a different country.You can also purchase without prescription from the pharmacist a one dose oral capsule called Fluconazole, this costs \u00a310 in the UK without a prescription.The doctor can prescribe prescriptions for these too.As a home remedy you can apply natural set yogurt to your washed and gently dried area.\u00a0\u00a0It does help to relieve any soreness and itching and also helps to relieve inflammation.\u00a0\u00a0Do not use soaps or shower gels.\u00a0\u00a0Only use non perfumed gentle soaps.\u00a0\u00a0Soaps dry out the skin and change the pH balance of the skin aggravating it further.Only wear cotton underwear and use non biological washing detergents and fabric softeners suitable for delicate skin.Your partner may need to be treated too.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes there is itching, sometimes soreness.\u00a0\u00a0Some men sometimes get no symptoms at all.Ensure that you have a well balanced diet.\u00a0\u00a0If you do have diabetes, make sure that your sugar levels are well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0Cut down on sugary foods and drink.\u00a0\u00a0If you use antibiotics that too can encourage yeast overgrowth.As bobdylan1958 says, use lubrication.\u00a0\u00a0You can buy KY jelly or different makes and use it on yourself and also on your partner.I would not recommend applying antiseptic cream to your genital area.Best wishes.",
