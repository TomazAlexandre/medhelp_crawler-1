            "answer": "I thought bipaps were used for sleep apnea because of the breathing problem. Do they actually use them for my type of sleep disorder? If so, how does it help it? The recommendation on my sleep study was elavil, which gave me terrible nightmares. Now I take ambien, but I can only take it occasionally because my short term memory became almost nonexistent when I took it daily.Thank you so much for your recommendations! After it taking 3 sleep studies to get this info. my neuro has dropped the ball. I am going to get a new neuro. and go forward with this.",

    "question": "Dear Dr,I have a couple of questions:On the sleep study questionaire is asks about waking up an hour after falling asleep screaming (or something of the sort). I, often, wake about that time because of a nightmare by calling for help or for my husband.\u00a0\u00a0What significance does that have?This question may not have an answer, but... I am falling apart it seems. I am 40+ female and\u00a0\u00a0I exercise (except these 5 wks rheum. put a stop to it). I have so many conditions that have been diagnosed in the past few years and I was wondering if there is any connection. Here is my lovely list:Mitral Valve Prolapse, Mitral Regurgitation, Tricuspid Regurg., Inappropriate Sinus Tachycardia, Neurocardiogenic Syncope (near fainting), Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Raynaud",
