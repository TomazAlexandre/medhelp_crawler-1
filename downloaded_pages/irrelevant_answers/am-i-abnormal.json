    "question": "My symptoms seem different than everyone else's. I mean, I am not edgy, jumpy. I mean, I am constantly moving, sometimes pacing, but more because of boredom than anything else. The thing is, my anxiety stems from how I feel, my body sensations, like dizziness, head fogginess, extreme blankets of fatigue, etc. I am not anxious if I feel great, but only get anxious when my body does these weird things. Does that make sense? I mean, I am not shy anymore, I used to be, love being around people, family, doing things, but I cannot get my body to move the way I used to, it is a struggle and I feel like **** most days, which makes me just want to stay home. I am more symptomatic around my cycle, about days 1-10 or so then okay in between. I do not like to drive because of the way I feel. I am so frustrated. I was getting better with therapy, but I seem to be going back now.",
