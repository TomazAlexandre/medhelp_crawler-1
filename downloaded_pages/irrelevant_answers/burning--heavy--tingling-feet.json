            "answer": "PD is correct. MS doesn't usually present bilaterally. I'm living proof that id can present bilaterally :-)My first symptom was bilateral foot numbness. I couldn't feel either foot. It happened over 20 years ago. During my DX process 2 years ago we pieced together my history. The feet numbness thing was my initial MS relapse.As to your burning feet, that can be neuropathic pain cause by MS. It could be lots of other things as well. But again, I'm living proof that burning feet can be related to MS. I take daily meds to ward of the burning feet :-)Kyle",

            "answer": "Thanks for responses, Pastor Dan and Kyle. I am sorry to hear you have constant problems with burning feet, Kyle. To answer PD's questions: definitely not sunburn. They were burning nonstop in any position, from soccer game at around 2pm, and still this morning when I woke up, although were better when I actually got up. I wondered if this was a result of cooler morning air? Now at my desk, I'm feeling discomfort in my feet, although not as intense as yesterday. What else could cause this?It's really bugging me.",

    "question": "I haven't had any problems with any kind of symptoms since June. Now, with air conditioning off, after my son's soccer game where I was sitting out in 80 + temps, both of my feet started to burn then, and have continued since then. I am totally in limboland, waiting for a second brain mri after first showed four \"white spots\" and I just don't know what to think. I run, I am fit, I don't have diabetes or heart or circulation problems, I'm 43, and I can't figure out why my feet would do this. I don't think I have MS, but this kind of thing really makes me worry. I know you're all not doctors, but does that sound in any way familiar to you????????? So far, neurologist keeps telling me MS doesn't cause bilateral symptoms. But burning in both feet is only bilateral symptom - I've had others on one side.",
