It's a euthanasia site (the home service we used), but don't let that upset you, just read the Dr's article on \"Quality of Life\".\u00a0\u00a0It was immensely helpful to me.\u00a0\u00a0Just know if you do have to make the decision, you are doing it because you love Ruby so much.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, I will pray for for improvement.I hope this will be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Hugs to you.http://www.homepeteuthanasia.com/end-of-life-care/quality-of-life",

Do make sure you visit her at least once a day---she needs to hear your voice and feel your presence. Pet and stroke her as much as you can---Love is a great healer.She MUST know you are still there.Good Luck and please keep us posted, K?CML",

I'm not sure how long to give her hoping for an improvement neurologically, and I'm wondering if anyone else has a cat with this problem, and did it improve.\u00a0\u00a0I told the vet we have to give her at least a week, and she agreed, but there hasn't been any improvement yet and I'm not sure if I'm doing the right thing.",
