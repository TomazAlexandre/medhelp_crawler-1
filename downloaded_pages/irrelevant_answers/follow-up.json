            "answer": "I don't know but I have the exact same thing and cannot figure out what it is... theres a number of different things right now though that least me to believe its infection, but the chills are not being caused by any sort of fever my highest temp was also 98.8 ish and my lowest was like freakin 96.4... my temp keeps moving around wierdly and quickly, I mean I'm using a ear themonitor but it usually doesn't do this. (often times my temperature has always be in the 98 97 range and would maybe go to 99 cuz I'd leave it in my ear to long or something).I'm so cold right now I should have goose bumps, and I've noticed I feel colder in my lower legs (feet when shoes are off, and sweaty with socks and shoes on) hands are kind of always clammy but still colder, they're cold and sweaty.I started feeling sick monday last week after sleeping in the basement, I felt weak with some minor muscle aches nothing severe, tired and always had the chills, I got some diarhea and also felt naucious even like I was holding down throw up but it wouldn't come out unless I were to force it up it was a wierd feeling.It got better when I started sleeping more and trying to eat healthy foods, also I visited a friend at college (I was feeling better) but then I got up there and ended up getting a headache and feeling bad again (it sort of went away when I ate more though like it was a hunger head ache cuz I neglected eating cuz of the long drive). Felt better after eating, and we partied that night (yea yea leave me alone). I won't say I was really drunk but like, the next morning I felt completely fine.I just still had minor chills, so I wore warm clothing and felt fine. Continued to feel better, then I got home and now I feel like off again, chills are getting worse, I just want the chills to go away, my temp is still lingering around 96/97 and is easily swayed (if I wear warm clothing it goes up to 98.8 ish) I'm probably gonna go stand outside for a bit (with a coat on and stuff so I at least feel warm) then take my temp again to see what it says, if it drops below 96 I'm gonna consult a doctor.Another odd thing was that when I was in the car no matter what I did with the thermostat in the car, I still had the chills even when I had the car set to like 76 degrees and I could feel my self sweating, it felt comfortable, but as soon as I turned it off it felt cold again.It feels like my body is sort of not controling its temperature very well and is being easily swayed by slight temperature changes in my enviroment. I snowboard and I know when I should be shivering, wearing like 4 layers with a jacket in 38 degree weather, I don't shiver, so something is wrong with me.So far my main suspect culprit is Diabetes (food seems to be effecting it somewhat and my Grandpa had it) other than that I've read about Lyme's Discease Lupus Tuberculosis and a few others.I'd also like to point out, that the wierd throwup but no throw up feeling happened earlier once before, and I couldn't sleep because I thought I was going to throw up while asleep, so I kind of helped it out I guess... I also had chills then too, but it went away after so idk whats going on.Another thing to take note of, my sister recently got over something, but she spiked a fever at like 102 or something, they thought she had strep, and they said it was some infection, but wernt entirely sure (I think idk, maybe my dad just doesnt remember). I'd also like to say coughing is another symptom but I smoke so its sort of hard to tell because I feel like I'm always coughing.Another suspect which is sort of embarassing though is Bolimia (sp?) mainly because I only felt chills like this once before after my girlfriend broke up with me and my body physically refused to hold down food, I felt sick cold chills and couldn't sleep for days on end, I thought it eventually went away, but now I'm questioning the possibility of a mental health problem too.My first suspect is going to be Diabetes though and if this doesnt go away I'll get tested for it.",

            "answer": "Interestingly enough, I read somewhere that B Vitamin Deficiency can cause the chills or something like that, but its not usually likely. I think that was what I had, but theres a number of other reasons you can get the chills with no fever, and I read somewhere even some viruses can do this.The reason I felt better after going to my friends college is because I always drink alot of water and vitamin drinks with B vitamins (cures my hangover) and ironically enough also made my chills go away, I got back home and wasn't drinking those drinks anymore so it came back... I drank 2 vitamin water Revives today and I feel so much better, less chills, I think all of my symtoms are related to vitamin deficiency actually, my temperature moving around, probably just normal, I was getting paranoid.How ever I still feel tired a lot, getting some headaches too, and this cough (different form my normal cough I get from my smoking) so I may still go for a check up of somekind soon, I have a feeling I just have a cold though and the lack of vitamins in my diet wasn't helping.",
