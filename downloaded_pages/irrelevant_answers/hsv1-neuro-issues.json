            "answer": "most adults will test + for hsv1 however only 20-40% of them ever get obvious cold sores to know that they have the virus orally.no reason to think that you have anything other than hsv1 orally. your symptoms you are having aren't due to hsv1 either.if you were never tested for herpes before this, no way to know if you contracted hsv1 when you were a wee lad, from the very first person you kissed or from kissing someone within the last few months.are you getting help with your anxiety issues?grace",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply Grace.My anxiety is being caused by something. It isn't merely anxiety for anxiety's sake so I'm actively seeking out the answer.Unfortunately I'm having to do most of the foot work myself since most doctors are too eager to prescribe anti-anxiety medication (which doesn't work for me) and aren't willing to find the cause.Thus far I've been able to rule out thyroid issues, diabetes, and brain tumors but now I'm searching into dormant causes since it appears to come in waves.Seeing as how herpes has 'flare ups' that was my next option to check into and I was quite worried when my test results came back positive.I'm off to the doctor's office today to find out about allergens and speak with them more about what I need to do going forward knowing I have hsv1.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with HSV type 1 with an IgG test result of 4.32 (flag HIGH).I'm a 29 year old male who has never showed signs of cold sores or any blisters. I've had to deal with anxiety issues and panic disorder since becoming sexually active when I was 21.My recent positive test for type 1 has me EXTREMELY concerned right now because for the past 2 weeks I have had headaches, extreme changes in consciousness, dizziness, and irritability. I tested negative for type 2.The clinic is closed today but first thing tomorrow morning I was going to go in for an allergy test even though I do not have sinus inflammation or drainage but I thought my neuro issues may be due to some allergen.After discovering today that I have type 1 I've read about Herpes Encephalitis and now I'm extremely concerned and wondering if I need to look into this further.Any help would be greatly appreciated.",
