            "answer": "You should be in optimal health before ttc, But if you are going to be trying very soon, you should lose the weight before you are in the process of trying...Dieting while pregnant/or trying is a no no...You typically gain any where from 25-45 lbs. or more during pregnancy, and some women have a very difficult time losing that baby weight after..In your case, based on what you have described as your weight history, It seems like it would be better for your own health reasons to get everything together now, and not when you are unable to, being pregnant. After all, carrying around a baby is not easy, even for those in optimal health, and proper weight...And it is espescialy important to eat healthy when you are pregnant, because your growing baby is living off of what you put into your own body..So take care of you health/weightnow, and you and your future baby will benefit.

            "answer": "Take it from a woman who's been there.\u00a0\u00a0I was 265lbs when I got pregnant with my first daughter, pregnancy went great only gained 25lbs and lost it the first week after giving birth.\u00a0\u00a0No complication from birthWith my second daughter I was 293 and only gained 32lbs and agin lost it the first week after giving birth and then another 80 in the first year.\u00a0\u00a0NO complications from birth.Yes, would it help if you lost some weight before getting pregnant, probably, but if your OBGYN isn't concerned then I say why wait.The two biggest complications you can get when pregnant and being overweight is pre-eclampsia and gestional diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But if you and your doctor keep a close eye out, you should be fine.Good Luck!",

    "question": "Just a quick question.\u00a0\u00a0DH and I are planning to TTC in the VERY near future and I am trying to get all my ducks in a row. I am 5'10 and weigh 235lbs. When I was 21 I started bc and I have had a really hard time with my weight.\u00a0\u00a0I used to could just drop the pounds.\u00a0\u00a0I know as you get older your body changes. But I've gone from 174lbs to 235lbs in 6 years and I can not lose it.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 26 and I've had tests done and my metabolism, etc. are perfect. That's why I think it's the bc.\u00a0\u00a0But, of course, my dr. tends to say it's not.\u00a0\u00a0But that is a whole other story.\u00a0\u00a0My mom has been telling me that I need to lose some lbs. before I TTC and get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a concern?\u00a0\u00a0My OBGYN has never told me I need to lose weight to get pregnant. Should I lose some weight, or do you think everything will be fine and I can work on it after the baby?",
