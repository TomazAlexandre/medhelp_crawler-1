            "answer": "I do watch what I eat. The diabetes makes sure that I do that. I have cut my snacks to more healthy snacks, I snack on veggies during the day, I have cut my pastas to measured amounts according to carb counts..my breads and potatos. Juices I drink very seldom because of the sugar content. And this may sound weird, but my back is starting to hurt from the weight of my belly...sheesh.",

I have done all I know to do. Ive never had a weight problem til now. Is T3 something I need?",

She didnt check my T3 because the medicine I am on is T4....which is converted to T3. She said the TSH test is the most sensitive measurement. What the.....?I also asked her if taking the brand Synthroid would be better than the generic Levothyroxine...all she said was...she thought it would be fine if I tried the brand..and did I want her to write me a script for it.

Hands and feet stay cold, cant sleep, extreme weight gain (20lbs over 6 mo.) in the upper part of my tummy, headaches, extremely dry skin, memory lapses,constipation. My Dr. says my numbers are normal. I have asked her about the T3 test she says I dont need it because I am not on T3 meds. I have asked my Diabetes Dr. to change my meds. I want to go back on Metformin instead of the insulin because NOW I understand what it takes with the pill form, before I didnt. Neither wants to do anything. Should I change Drs? Mt GP says: eat less, exercise. He just thinks I am lazy. I have already fired him....what next?",

She said try this.....What is the difference in Synthroid and Levothyroxine?\u00a0\u00a0Which is what I was on immediately following my thyroid removal in Aug of 08.Are they not the same thing? I am just not understanding why my Dr. wont test anything else. I am currently looking for a new Endo Dr. I just cant keep going on this way...it is frustrating to say the least. Anything I eat seems to make me have constipation. I have this mid belly thing going on which is just disgusting.....that was not there prior to thyroid surgery.....and no matter what I do..no one listens...or is the bulge going away.",

    "question": "I guess I should start by saying I am new here..and I have this dilemna. I feel like **** all the time. Dry, patchy scaly skin, headaches, I dont sleep very well, I am tired all the time not near the energy I had before the surgery. I have almost lost all of my sex drive. I get hot then cold, and it seems like I am forgetting things...even at my job..and that cannot happen. I got my T4 free results: 1.4\u00a0\u00a0 TSH 0.434. Dr. says normal. the numbers are normal....but why am I gaining weight (20 pounds). It seems like\u00a0\u00a0daily. And why do I\u00a0\u00a0feel the way I feel if everything is normal? I have had a hysterectomy 17 yrs ago, that would explain some bloating maybe, and all the weight I gain is right in the middle of my belly...I am starting to look 5 months preggers....This is so NOT fun. Being that I had my thyroid removed 8 months ago, I am currently on Levothyroxine\u00a0\u00a0(0.125 mg). I also have\u00a0\u00a0type 2 diabetes, insulin dependent. I take 35 units of Lantus at night. I take Novolog on a sliding scale using 2 units per carb. My blood sugars are in control. I take Lisinopril 40mg. I take Amlodipine 5 mg.\u00a0\u00a0I have gained weight and cannot lose any. It is as if I have a tube in my belly pumping air in. I do treadmill , ablounge and pilates 4 days a week. I have even changed the way I eat because of this weight issue.",
