            "answer": "Thank you for visiting the Family Practice ForumLets do some math.12 beers at 150 calories/beer = 1800 calories/day6 weeks is 42 days or a total of 1800 X 42 = 75,600 caloriesNow, to lose ONE POUND, you need to cut 3500 calories, so 75600/3500 = 21 pounds.What I am saying is that if you drank 12 beers/day and now cut that entirely out of your diet, and made no other changes, it would not be surprising that you may lose over 20 pounds in that six week period.Of course you most likely do drink other beverages which contain calories and therefore, your weight loss may not be as great as 21 pounds, but to answer your question YES! it is quite possible that cutting all that beer ( and all those calories )out of your diet, resulted in this 13 pound weight loss. By the way ... GOOD FOR YOU!Now, I do need to mention that there are other causes for weight loss which include diabetes and hypothyroidism. I don't SUSPECT that this is the case here, but a blood test at the doctor's office to rule out these conditions would be in order.I hope this helps!",

            "answer": "I would just like to point out that I believe the information you've provided at the end of your reply to the fellow above - concerning other possible reasons for weight loss...you mentioned diabetes and hypothyroidism - is inaccurate.I have hypothyroidism, and it in fact makes it MORE difficult for a person to lose weight, and therefore makes \"unexplainable\" weight GAIN sometimes occur (unexplainable until you pinpoint the condition, that is). The same goes with diabetes; it often is the reason behind uncalled for weight gain, which is why so many people who suffer from diabetes tend to have issues with keeping their weight down.My point is, I think what you meant to type there was \"hyPERthyroidism\" and not hypothyroidism like you have stated. False information can be damaging. Please, be careful to state the facts!!!",

    "question": "6 weeks ago I was diagnosed with a fatty liver after a sonogram and blood work. At the time I was drinking 10 or 12 beers a day.\u00a0\u00a0I have quit completely in these last six weeks. I was given the sonogram because I was having URQ pain which comes and goes and still am having these mild pains.. Upper and lower GI scopes were negative. In this 6 week period I have lost 13 pounds. I have a strong appetite still.\u00a0\u00a0I am eating a little less on purpose though because I am 6 foot 2 inches and weigh 236 pounds now.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible to lose weight this fast by just stopping this much beer drinking and slightly cutting back on food consumption? Even though I want to lose weight I am a little concerned about this fast weight loss.",
