            "answer": "I haven't personally but as long as you take care of yourself, exercise, eat well, cute back on sugars and startches you should be fine :-) as for vag delivery this is my opinion bc I disagree with doctors on this but with gd they get induction and csection happy bc omg your baby could possibly weigh a pound more than normal. So I would talk to your doctor and see what their thoughts and usual course of action with gd patients and stress that you want to try a natural birth. Also just a bit of info a baby is not considered 'big' until 9lbs14 oz. My mil had a 9.14 and my mother had a 10.3 and neither of them had gd. Lol good luck huny I Joe all guess we'll for you! :-)",

So if I eat a carby meal, I go for a 10 to 15 minutes walk at a brisk pace. It helps to bring my numbers down. My morning ones are always low because of the pill.my baby is healthy and kicking and rolling so it's not as bad as you might fear.",
