            "answer": "Hi and Welcome,Get screened for diabetes properly with a glucose tolerance test will be your first step.\u00a0\u00a0You should also be screened for thryoid problems which can be an issue.Being overweight can contribute to the heat intollerance.\u00a0\u00a0Tell your doctor your symptoms and concerns and get treated.In the meantime stay as active as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Things can sometimes happen very fast in MS, but often it happens slowly..... but then, you're not diagnosed with MS and chances are this can be explained by other things.Keep logging in here and let us know how you go with your PCP.\u00a0\u00a0Others here are also very supportive and will give you good feedback.Before you see your dr. try to make a list of your symptoms and also when you noticed they started.\u00a0\u00a0It you want to post it here people can give you more feedback.Take care.Sally",

Do you have unquenchable thirst that goes along with the frequent urinating?\u00a0\u00a0Emg's are very useful for showing the damage and it can be from different types of disease.Yes please keep us updated on what you find out.Jazzy",

            "answer": "Hi, there.\u00a0\u00a0It's been a while since I started this thread, and I've had every test BUT a glucose tolerance.\u00a0\u00a0To answer jazzy's question, no, I do not have unquenchable thirst.\u00a0\u00a0I've lost a little weight since then, and I'm handling stairs better.\u00a0\u00a0I've been dx with transverse myelitis.\u00a0\u00a0I have two or three lesions in my spinal cord (different machines and radiologists) and some punctate ones in my brain.\u00a0\u00a0The brain ones might be from all the years of high blood pressure, although it's been treated all along.\u00a0\u00a0My LP showed inflammation in the spinal fluid, but no raised iGg index or o-bands.\u00a0\u00a0The EMG says it's not peripheral, and of course, the spinal cord MRI says it's central.\u00a0\u00a0I've had the tinglies go almost completely away, then come back for a week or so a couple of times.\u00a0\u00a0I visit the neurologist again in October.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I've also had a normal VEP.My reading on the punctate paraventricular white matter brain lesions says glucose intolerance or prediabetes can cause them, as well as high blood pressure and high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0So only time will tell if they're vascular or MS, but coupled with the spinal ones and the return of symptoms, guess which way I think it's going to go.\u00a0\u00a0I've gotten a bit dizzy when out in the heat, but I haven't given it a real good challenge yet this year.The sleep study shows I have very mild sleep apnea when on my side, but pretty bad on my back.\u00a0\u00a0I only slept on my back because the guy told me to, so I'm not too concerned about that.\u00a0\u00a0With high blood pressure, the doc thinks the mild one is worth treating, but I'm not willing to go the CPAP or tissue-trimming route without losing the rest of the weight first, and of course, getting the MS possibility settled.It was after the normal EMG that my doctor started the MRI and MS route.How's your fasting glucose, and do you have other diabetes-like symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0The people on this forum are awesome about explaining anything and everything.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to both of us, indeed.Holly",

Maybe I should ask for a GTT because of the possible ischemic cause of the punctate WMLs?As for hemoglobin, I can't lay hands on a complete lab report right now, but it hasn't ever been mentioned as abnormal.Now if it's Mary Kay, she just hasn't had it done yet, but it's scheduled.\u00a0\u00a0And her do-it-yourself fasting glucose is pretty high at 135.Keeping track of all of us is a little like herding cats, don't you think?\u00a0\u00a0Cats with beans in their ears?Holly",

Father was a type II diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I have a BMI of 31.\u00a0\u00a0One of my sons was nearly 10 pounds at birth.\u00a0\u00a0I walk half an hour most days.\u00a0\u00a0Can walk on a flat surface forever (as long as it's cool), but one flight of stairs gets me winded.\u00a0\u00a0Don't smoke or drink.Lousy family history for heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0Recent\u00a0\u00a0nuclear stress test\u00a0\u00a0was fine.\u00a0\u00a0High blood pressure controlled by medicine, and Zocor for cholesterol.Frequent urination, including 4-5 times at night.\u00a0\u00a0Had a UTI in September, my second ever.Two months ago, the skin on one side of my stomach got numb and tingly.\u00a0\u00a0I chalked it up to a long plane ride and jeans digging in my waist, but it hasn't gone away.\u00a0\u00a0A week later, all my fingers and toes started getting the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0It's constant, but I notice it especially after a hot bath, or at night in bed.I've only had a fasting glucose > 100 once, but\u00a0\u00a0<110.\u00a0\u00a0Most recent was 98.\u00a0\u00a0Never had a glucose tolerance test.Scheduled for a sleep study and EMG next week, appt with PCP right after Christmas for results.\u00a0\u00a0EMG sounds scary because of the diseases that get linked to it on searches, like ALS.\u00a0\u00a0My physical therapist SisInLaw says sounds like MS, but muscles and nerves are her bag.\u00a0\u00a0The fatigue, heat sensitivity, paresthesia, frequent urination, and dizzy spells kind of go along with that, too.\u00a0\u00a0Don\u2019t have muscle weakness, but feet cramp often, and I get stabby feelings in them sometimes.Dr. Ramsetty on the Type II Diabetes board says it is unlikely I have diabetic neuropathy, but to ask for a glucose tolerance test anyway and maybe referral to a neurologist. Great. Am I going to get bad news in a couple of weeks?\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like MS (or worse) to you? Thanks.",
