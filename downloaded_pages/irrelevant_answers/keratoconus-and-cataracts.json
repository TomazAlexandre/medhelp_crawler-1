            "answer": "Why is Crosslinking not an option? I would need to personally evaluate your eyes to see what is your best or all of your options, but surgery may not be your only option. Gas Perm contact lens may slow down or treat Keratoconus somewhat.Best wishes,Timothy D. McGarity, Medical Doctor, Ophthalmologist",

            "answer": "One thing to try is to slow down the cataract growth as much as possible.Although many cataracts are the result of factors beyond your control, you should be sure to protect your eyes from UV light (wear UV-protective sunglasses when outside), try to prevent diabetes or keep it under control, use caution when prescribed steroid-based medications (injected or inhaled), be aware statins may promote cataract development (use them if you need to, but be aware of the possible link).\u00a0\u00a0That sort of thing.Use the internet to research causes of cataract and do what you can to help keep them from getting worse as long as you can.I hope crosslinking will become an option for you in the future.\u00a0\u00a0My optometrist described it as a 'game changer' for keratoconus patients.",

My Doc wants to implant INTACS and replace my lenses with artificial lenses. Crosslinking is not an option atm.My question: Is it common to have both Keratoconus and cataracts together, and is surgery my only option?Will I go blind if I opt out of surgery?",
