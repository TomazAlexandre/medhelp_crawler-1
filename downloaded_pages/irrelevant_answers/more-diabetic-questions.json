You see, I took the glucose fasting test and it came out low, then 2 hours later I drank a glucola and my sugar level went up high. My symptoms currently are sore throat, muscle weakness, chronic fatigue, increase of acne, face paleness, and it takes longer for my bruises to heal up. No I don't smoke, I drank beer once in a while BEFORE, but I was never an alcoholic. Doctor saids it's pre-diabetes. Does it sound right to you, or does it sound like someting else?",
