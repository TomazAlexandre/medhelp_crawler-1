High levels are bad news!\u00a0\u00a0A good article on this is \"Homocysteine the Silent Killer\" - Squidoo.

They look like a cigarette and even have nicotine (that's the reason you can't give up smoking - more addictive than heroin!) but it doesn't contain the cancer causing agents. So you can lower the nicotine cartridges over time until you quit. You can smoke e-cigs indoors as it is a water vapour not toxic second hand smoke. Johnny Depp was smoking an e-cig in the movie The Tourist. A bit of trivia. :)",
