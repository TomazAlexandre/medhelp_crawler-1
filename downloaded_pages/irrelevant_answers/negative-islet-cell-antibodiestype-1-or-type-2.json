I have an apt to see my doc in the beginning of feb and will also discuss this with him, but I am just trying to make some sense of my test results.",

            "answer": "I think it odd that nobody has asked you whether you are overweight. If so, you may be able to help your diabetes greatly by losing weight. Fat cells are insulin-resistant cells, and this is a simple explanation of why type 2 diabetes tends to strike people who have excess body fat. Anyway, even though you have been diagnosed as type 1, if you need to lose a few pounds, I would urge you to do so. Weight loss can be all that is needed to help some of these diabetics control their diabetes. Many doctors classify their type 2 diabetics as type 1 if they need insulin instead of an oral medication to stimulate the pancreas or to help the body use its insulin better. So sometimes the label can be somewhat misleading.I believe that the person who wrote to suggest a C-peptide level test to see exactly what your pancreas is producing has a good suggestion, if you truly feel you want to know whether your pancreas is working or not.The other writers who mention the \"honeymoon phase\" are absolutely correct. In the cases of most diabetics, the pancreas eventually completely gives up the ghost if they are type 1 diabetics. However, there are a few of us that I know about (myself being one) who seem to still secret some insulin of our own many years after diagnosis (35 years after diagnosis, in my case). So you have good news if there is indeed no immune system revolt destroying your beta cells right now. You may be one of the fortunate ones who will have a slightly easier time maintaining good control if some of your beta cells continue to thrive and help you out.One last thought that you might find helpful.. there seem to be 3 different ages when many people seem to be diagnosed. Those three ages are: 1) infancy or early childhood,2) at about the age of the onset of puberty,3) and early 20's such as yourself.Obviously, if you truly are wondering if you should be on insulin or on an oral medication (assuming that you were not given oral medications to start off with), for this would be the real difference in treatment between a type 1 or type 2 diagnosis, then DO seek a second opinion.",

    "question": "I am 22 years old and was diagnosed a little over a year ago as a type 1 based on my age, weight, symptoms, etc.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugar was about 600 that morning, my a1c was 9.6% and I lost about 8-10 pounds 2-3 weeks before my diagnosis.I rececently had my blood screened to determine whether I have islet cell anti-bodies which would confirm that I am indeed a type 1 (I don't need all that much insulin and occasionally can go a few hours with my pump suspended without my blood sugars skyrocketing) and it came back negative. Is it possible that I am a type 2 and perhaps will no longer be dependent on insulin once my pancreas recovers from this \"phase\"?",
