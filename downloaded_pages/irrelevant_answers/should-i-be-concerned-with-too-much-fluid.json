            "answer": "I had a ton of extra amniotic fluid with my youngest son. It can mean several things, such as birth defects, diabetes and high blood pressure. It also allows baby to move more freely in the womb so having a breech baby is also a very high possibility. The baby can go from head down position to breech almost instantly, so having a vaginal birth they need to monitor baby's position almost constantly.I do not see how they think you have to much amniotic fluid if you are measuring correctly. I measured 45 weeks with my son at delivery even though I had him 2 weeks early.I dont think there is anything to worry about in general, I always carry a lot of amniotic fluid with all my pregnancies, and all my children turned out 100% fine, I was also able to have a vaginal delivery with all of them.They could possible reduce the amount of fluid, but beings you are so far along it is probably unlikely.",
