By about 7months he was back in the normal hight weight brackets. Except for his head it remains in the 97%. He has no health problems at all. At 20 months he has only had a couple of minor viruses.",

            "answer": "at all my u/s my DD was measuring large. I failed my 1 hr glucouse but passed my 3hr, I didnt have GD although my doctor and all the u/s techs claimed I must have. Baby have tons of fluid too. I had my final u/s at 37 weeks and my DD was measuring almost 10 lbs. She was born 2 days later weighing 7 lbs 6 oz. Perfect health. She does have a very large head but so do all my boys (measuring 95% and above) so I dont know if that influanced the u/s in any way.\u00a0\u00a0U/s can oviously be off but even if yours isnt , a big baby doesnt mean there is a problem or even a problem to deliver as I know many woman that have vaginally deliverd 10 lb babies. So dont automaticly opt for a csection because your afraid of babies size. Thats just my 2 cents.Also is this your first baby?? If it isnt and your last baby was average size I wouldnt think this one would be off but much. Also were you or your DH large babies?? Maybe that is an influencing factor as to why your baby is measuring so large??Best of luck!",
