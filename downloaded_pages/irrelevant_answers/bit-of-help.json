            "answer": "Dear Friends,I have very much enjoyed my time on Medhelp and have learned from you even while hosting our Ask-A-Doctor forum for Diabetes. Sadly I am leaving the Medhelp community as my own practice has become busier and time constraints have proved quite challenging. So from April 7th 2008 I will be officially away from Medhelp, but you can still find me at our practice website www.endocrinehelp.com, so please drop me a\u00a0\u00a0line if you wish. Most likely a new physician will be hosting the Diabetes forum for Medhelp in the future, so please continue to check in with the Medhelp community.All the best to you and blessings for the future,Sincerely,Anita Ramsetty,MD",

            "answer": "Hi Mat:\u00a0\u00a0:o)I don\u2019t know if you are still around or if you got an answer to your question.I\u2019ve just put a bit in.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that it helps ya.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry, also a bit preachy.Diabetes is a hard disease for anyone, freaking frustrating and scary sometimes certainly for Teens/Young Adults since you are in the peer-pressure group.\u00a0\u00a0Been there, done that.\u00a0\u00a0And Diabetes is not your fault.You are here asking, so that puts you a step ahead of others and shows that you are interested in your health.\u00a0\u00a0Way to be.1st.\u00a0\u00a0Your health is way more important than playing soccer.\u00a0\u00a0If you lose a leg or your eye sight from uncontrolled blood sugars, soccer won\u2019t be a choice and it won\u2019t help you.\u00a0\u00a0If you are working full-time then you must get sick-leave, time off for appointments(you\u2019ll need a note from your Dr.) and vacation time.\u00a0\u00a0If you work part-time there\u2019s more time. especially when you are a Diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I\u2019ll have to short-form it for space.2nd.\u00a0\u00a0Test soon after getting up before consuming anything to see what your sugar is. Take your shots (fast-acting 10 minutes before you have your breakfast, then try and test 2 hours after you\u2019ve eaten your first bite of food. Do this before and after each meal and again before bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0Also\u00a0\u00a0if you feel weird: TEST.\u00a0\u00a0If you are ill, drink lots of liquids(preferably sugar-less or low sugar drinks) and TEST often, especially if you have a fever.3rd.\u00a0\u00a0If you don\u2019t know how to count carbohydrates then learn it from your Dietician(get a referral from your Dr.)(Endo preferably)who you will be seeing since you have all this spare time. ;o)\u00a0\u00a0Carbs get stored in your body and is turned into glucose which your liver shoots out if you get lows.Carbs are in most foods especially junk food, pastries, potatoes, corn, peas, pasta/sauce, white rice white bread, white buns(whole wheat/brown is usually less)pizza.\u00a0\u00a0Pasta, pizza, chinese food(terrible for blood-sugars) stays in your system longer so it keeps your sugars higher longer or can make a spike a few hours later.If you don\u2019t read food labels on packages, learn to.\u00a0\u00a0It goes hand in hand with carb counting.\u00a0\u00a0You also need to know how much Insulin to take for how many carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin to carb ratio.\u00a0\u00a0It varies Person-to-Person, just as food does.\u00a0\u00a0Usually 45 carbs per meal and 15 carbs per each snack(usually 3 a day).\u00a0\u00a0Eat in moderation.\u00a0\u00a0Have one potato not the whole bag.\u00a0\u00a0Meats and most cheeses are very low carb or carb-free.\u00a0\u00a0Look at the label. Do not eat junk food or a lot of food before bed.\u00a0\u00a0Meats, cheeses on 4-6 crackers, peanut butter on a slice of brown bread, etc. will do.4th. If you are over-weight, try your Best to lose some.\u00a0\u00a0It will help you to take less Insulin and will open more cells for Insulin to go into. Losing weight is also better for your heart, joints and your health all around.5th.\u00a0\u00a0Since you are on Lantus maybe it would be better for you to split it am and pm.,if you find it is not working for you.\u00a0\u00a0Most do.\u00a0\u00a0Your Dr. has to tell you in what division though and how much.\u00a0\u00a0It takes a few days to change over.\u00a0\u00a0It should not be totally switched in one day. I take 12 units when I get up and 10 units 12 hours later but then I am a small female and I don\u2019t eat much. Lantus doesn\u2019t work for 24 hours as they claim.\u00a0\u00a0More like 20 -22 hours.6th.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking alcohol, you must know that that is not recommended for a Diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0It takes your sugar up then drops you fast usually when you are asleep, and sometimes into a seizure if you drink on an empty stomach.\u00a0\u00a0If you must drink, 2 drinks per day for a Guy and 1 drink a day for a Gal is recommended.\u00a0\u00a0If you must drink more, then also have a meal before you drink so it will absorb most of it.\u00a0\u00a0A drunk brain does not think or care about testing sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you test and correct your sugars.7th.\u00a0\u00a0Get your blood tested(A1c-shows your average blood sugar for 3 months)and your other should-know tests, about twice a year, so you know what number you are trying to work for. A good A1c goal is 6.5 or less.8th.\u00a0\u00a0Drink your 6-8 glasses of water a day.\u00a0\u00a0It keeps you hydrated, flushes your kidneys, rids your blood of some sugar and toxins, etc.There\u2019s always more but that will do for now.Joannie961*Type 1 for 40 years*If you take the time to learn it, it will get easier to keep that Monster in a cage.

    "question": "Hello, my name is mat. I have had type 1 diabetes since i was 5 and am just coming into the last stages of my teenage years (im 19 this year, 14th year with diabetes), When i was younger my parents had my diabetes under great control, but then i started to take care of it all independantly around the age of 13. Since then i found my control hasnt been the greatest and im the first to admit that my care was a little reckless (eating junk, not checking bgls, experimenting with alcohol etc) which has developed into some habits. This is my second year living away from home and i wish to get my life in order, starting with my diabetes. I realise that i will have it for life and wish to live happy and healthy for as long as possible. Do you have any suggestions or ideas on how i can change my ways and get my control back? I eat pretty healthy now and exercise alot but my levels seem to be all over the place still. I am on 25units of novorapid before breakfast, lunch and afternoon tea and 45units of lantus before i go to bed. Im having troubles getting to a diabetes specialist as i have very little time due to work and soccer taking up almost every day.Any ideas or thoughts about everything or anything?Thankyou,Mat",
