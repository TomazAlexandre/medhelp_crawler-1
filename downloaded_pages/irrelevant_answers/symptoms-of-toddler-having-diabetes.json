            "answer": "sugar will end up in the urin, not in the poo. But I agree that it sounds like she has a gut problem, maybe a bad bacteria or even fungus. These are hard to test for, so the only advice I have is google scd diet and pecanbread.com, read through their advice, and think about if you want to give this special gut healing diet a try.",

            "answer": "Hello,you may need to have her tested for celiac.\u00a0\u00a0This needs a gluten free diet, nt just a wheat free diet (not the same).\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like gut issues, definitely.\u00a0\u00a0Many with celiac also need to go dairy free - if this is her problem.Her Dr. can test her for blood sugar both fasting and HBA1C should be tested.\u00a0\u00a0If either show cause for concern, further testing can then be carried out.",

    "question": "My 22 month old girl, is progressing in every way expected - talking, learning, growing, weight is likely above average, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Since she was 8 months old her she has been getting progressive dry skin patches (eczema on feet, knees and elbows) Along with recurrent yeast infections that will only disappear with medication and reappear when cream is stopped.\u00a0\u00a0Her bowel movements have always been of a mash potato consistency, that is normal for an infant should this still be happening at almost 2 years old?\u00a0\u00a0I just thought it was an indication she was getting a good amount of fiber.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be a sign of too much sugar in the stool?I'm wondering if she has type 1 Diabetes.Daycare agrees she drinks a lot (always has her cup), but not necessary excess, same with the urination (7 to 10 diaper changes a day).\u00a0\u00a0Daycare does not think she has as much energy as some other kid's she has watched over the years however is that just a personality trait.As this age is hard to tell if she is hungry or if needs a sugar boost.\u00a0\u00a0i don't know how to test if she has blurry vision.We have tried removing lactose and wheat from her diet, and no improvement was seen.\u00a0\u00a0plus I followed the rules of introducing foods so i don't think this is an allergy.I did test her sugar a few hours after eating and it was 6.8 (about 120) but that is a random, one time prior to bed reading.",
