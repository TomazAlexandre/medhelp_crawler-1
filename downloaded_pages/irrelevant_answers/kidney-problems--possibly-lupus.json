            "answer": "We fully expected the kidney failure (yes, it is diagnosed by a nephrologist) to be from the diabetes. After the examination and all, he said he really does not think this has anything at all to do with it. He believes it is something else.",

    "question": "I was not sure what topis area this was, but here it goes. I am the 23 year old type I diabetic mother of a 10 month old baby boy. I have been spilling protein in my urine since i was 14 years old and my endocrinologist sent me to a nephrologist today. The nephrologist said that he does not think my kidney failure is due to my diabetes or to the pregnancy. he thinks it may be from some \"other\" disease. Anyone experienced this or have any ideas?? I am terrified. He named a couple diseases that it might be, and only two i can remember....lupus and Hep C. I believe i was tested for Hep C when i had my son, so i dont think that is a possibility. Please help. Thanks",
