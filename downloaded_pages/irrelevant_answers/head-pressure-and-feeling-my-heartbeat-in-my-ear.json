            "answer": "Have you had your blood pressure checked? And I don't mean just once or twice at the DR. You should keep a log of your BP's for 2 weeks and then let the DR see what happens, you should go to the fire department and have them check it once every day! Your symptoms sound like it could be related to your blood pressure. Don't feel afraid to ask Fire department to check it that is what they are there for...I know because I worked in the ER for 3 years!",
