My older sister also has it and so does my friend. We're all overweight. My sister's dermatologist said it's just from being overweight and it could be a sign of onset diabetes. That's freaky. Is there a way to actually get rid of it? I dunno. I just scrub it really hard with soap in the shower and it helps dim the coloration but it continues to get darker anyway.",

            "answer": "Hi. I have the same problem, and just this morning I went to my dermatologist and (slightly) figured out what it is.I'm 16 years old and and also over weight.Last time I went with my derm she said it was some type of yeast infection, but now it's related to diabetes.The patches of brown spots started on my bra line then traveled straight down to above my belly button. It also spread to under my underarms, it's forming on my neck, and I have a cluster on the right side of my waist. I saw some on my thighs a while ago and I have little clusters of about five spots around my back. I've also noticed a little dot near the inside of my elbow, which means it's spreading AGAIN.I started off with a couple little spots and now they are just clusters.After I'm done showering or if my skin is moist I can rub the patches and make some of the dead skin come off, but my skin gets really red from all the rubbing I have to do to see just a little bit of progress.This morning my dermatologist told me that my spots, irregular mesturation, and excessive facial hair are all likned to my mom having diabetes. (Yes, I happen to have all those problems.) My mom doesnt undestand how though, since she didnt have diabetes when I was born.I cant really recall what the name of the problem was but she did give me some things that could help.One of them was ZNP bar, a soap bar that can reduce the sight of sebborheic dermatitis. (It also helps with dandruff since it's an all-over soap bar.)The other prescrition was Extina Foam which also treats Seb- Der. It's light, foamy and not sticky when you apply it. I got a sample this morning and already tried it on. I just have to see what the results will be.I'm sure it's not Sebborheic Dermatitis though, because I've seen pictures of was Seb- Der looks like and it looks much more severe than what I have.I'm a little discouraged that they may not work because I'm sure I dont have Seb- Der, but I want to keep my hopes up.I also got a blood test done and will be called to see if it's something worse or if I'll need to take a pill that can help with my brown clusters.I hope this helped you and good luck to you all with finding something that can treat what we all have.",

            "answer": "Hello,I am 24 years old. I have always had an ongoing struggle with yeast/fungal related issues since i was a very small child. I was a little on the chunky side when i went through puberty, and as i began wearing bra's, i noticed that my sweat would actually dye fabric a pinkish color. my sister also had this strange problem. We did not have healthcare for a long time, until after i had become about 16-17 i had leveled out in my weight, and was somewhat on the thin side, i was able to go to the doctor. By this time i had started to develop strange brown spotting between my breasts. when i would scratch at them in the shower, they seemed to have a lot of dead skin that would come off. They were not spreading at this time, and i was curious as to what they were... it was almost as if i had gotten a strange uneven blotchy tan just in my cleavage area. The doctor told me she thought it was possibly related to diabetes, and scheduled me for a series of blood tests. They diagnosed me as pre-diabetic. So, i figured i would just have to live with it, and hope i didn't become diabetic as i got older.3-4 years later, I became pregnant, and regained healthcare. I had them test me for Diabetes, because i informed them that i had been diagnosed as pre-diabetic when i was younger...they tested, and came up negative. They said I wasn't even pre-diabetic. I told my doctor about the brown spots between my breasts, and he said to use selson blue on it, that it was a yeast thing... so i did. which made some sense to me, since when i was a kid i had problems with yeast/fungal things. It would burn slightly and made it flake some, but it did not go away. I then lost health coverage again.Now, 3 years later I have noticed it is spreading... i now have a trail of it going down my belly, almost to my belly button. My husband does not have it, nor my 3 year old daughter...so i do not think it is contagious.Now I am pregnant again..and health coverage again! so, i am going to re-attempt figuring out what exactly this thing is. I looked at the images of Acanthosis Nigricans, and they do seem to be an extreme version of whati have, however i began getting them when i was thin, not fat. AND i was diagnosed as pre-diabetic, but am now not even pre-diabetic... i don't understand!! i see a pattern between myself and all the people on here, but no one seems to understand WHY we really have it, or HOW to get rid of it. good luck to all, and perhaps i have been a little help to someone else by telling my personal experience.",

            "answer": "the spots are a fungal infection from spores in the air. starting from a spot that grows bigger, eventually spreading in small clusters all over. including on your head if you find it to be itchy at times. you need an anti fungal cream called miconazole cream with hydroquartizone. you will need a large supply of the stuff if it has spread in many places over the body as they only come in the tiniest tubes and run out in a day or two. as for having it on the head and body, there is a body wash over the counter that comes about 4 sachets per packet and is about 30dollars over the counter. you will probably need both topical remedies, as this fungal infection is soo hard to get rid of and doctors are so difficult in prescribing more than 3 tubes of it. the brown armpits is Acanthosis Nigricans. notice you also have slighty dark fingertips below your nail? or any creases in your body are slighty brown, use a mirror and look at the back of your neck to check and see if it is slightly brown. the fungal infection has a bit to do with being over weight as well as you tend to sweat more and.",

            "answer": "the spots will eventually seep water under them when they get irritated by some soaps and perfumes etc, when they get red and itcy like this they are very uncomfortable, and require the anti fungal cream asap, and also it is contagious, if you share clothes with your firends etc, untill you get rid of the spots, and make sure all of your clothing is washed daily and completely dried, as this is part of the cause of this condition, and living in damp homes often makes the spots worse and more irritated.miconazole cream Hand hydroquartizone will help, daktozin is also an anti fungal cream for babys and nappy rash associated with fungal infections, if you have some lying around the house use it and you will see as this has the hydroquartizone in it as well as buying micreme or Tinea Resolve will do the same trick.",

I was told to use Selsun Blue, it did nothing. It continued to gradually grow larger. I have/had(?) Endometrios and was seeing a doctor a couple of times a month and always tried to get the skin thing addressed as well. (2fer) I was always told it was a fungus and to use Dial soap. Then around 30, I began to get big, red itchy dry patches all over my stomach. At that time I was jogging 5 miles a day and was right about perfect weight for my frame. Again, not diabetes and this time, the reddish brown itchy spots seemed to be heat sensitive. Then at 34, after a suicide attempt (NOT due to the weird itchy spots!!) I decided toget serious about treatment for my Bi-Polar Disorder. A month after being on Lithium, the splotches were GONE! I'm 36 now, still on my Lithium (no more suicide attempts so far) and living itchy splotch freeeee!!!!",
