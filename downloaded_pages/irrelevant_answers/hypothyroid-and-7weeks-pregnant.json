            "answer": "Hi!Since you have been taking levothyroxine, your thyroid function may have been under control. Hence you conceived without any problems. Now since you are pregnant, it is very important to keep the thyroid hormones under control because a disturbed thyroid can disturb the level of pregnancy hormones. Mothers are strong human beings! I know you will find the courage to get tested for thyroid function and other related tests like diabetes, iron and hemoglobin, progesterone levels etc. Many women with hypothyroidism have given births to healthy babies with the right treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in touch with your Obs and Gyn and follow instructions carefully. God willing, you will soon be the mother of another healthy baby! Take care!",

            "answer": "Good news! Went for my blood test today. The first attempt they could get a vein, so they tried the other arm.. went fine, the nurse was amazing. I felt really proud of myself as had in effect been through it twice and didn't pass out! And then to top it all off I went for my first midwife appointment and had to have bloods taken there too! Three in one day and stayed conscious throughout! Treated myself to a new skirt on the way home by way of a reward! You are right we mums are made of strong stuff! Thank you for your kind and encouraging words. xxx",

    "question": "I was diagnosed Hypothyroid 4 years ago but have since been rubbish at getting checked and taking meds. Mostly because, believe it or not, I hate blood tests! I would rather do 13 hours of labour than one blood test. I have a healthy daughter age 6 and am now 7 weeks pg. I have a test scheduled for next week and have been religiously taking Levothyroxine for past week or so. Worried I may be too late. We had no problem conceiving and I have been feeling fine even with meds on and off in the past years. Have just started reading up on Hypo and pregnancy and getting really anxious...any words of encouragement welcome!",
