            "answer": "Hello umobile98!\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you've come to the Forum in search of answers to assist your husband in taking the best care of himself possible.\u00a0\u00a0I hope I can provide you with some answers and I know you'll probably get lots of additional suggestions as this topic is one that concerns everyone affected by diabetes, especially at the beginning.\u00a0\u00a0I want to let you know that none of us here are medical professionals ~ we are parents and spouses of type 1's or type 1's themselves.\u00a0\u00a0I am the mother of a now 18 year old son, so I can offer you suggestions from my personal experiences of the past 7 years of living with this disease.First, I'm happy to hear you'll be seeing the doctor tomorrow ~ is he an endocrinologist?\u00a0\u00a0That's a doctor who specailizes in diabetes, and is preferable, as he should be up-to-date on current diabetes management more so than say, a general practicianer.\u00a0\u00a0Your education classes will most likely answer your questions regarding meal planning, etc., but I can provide you with some initial suggestions.You mentioned your husband has been put on a 75 carb/meal diet ~ that should be enough to fill him up if he's balancing those carbs with enough fat and protein.\u00a0\u00a0The fat and protein allow the carbs \"to stay with\" him longer and will allow better asorption of his insulin.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't mention what kind of insulin routine he's on and that definitely will make a difference in how his meal plan is structured. Some insulins require a VERY strict timing, as well as quantity of carbohydrate intake.\u00a0\u00a0There is a newer insulin regimin called Lantus which doesn't require a person using it to eat at prescribed times as does the other long-acting insulins.\u00a0\u00a0For a person using Lantus, they would take that injection 1 or 2 times each day to cover their basal rate of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Then when they eat, they calculate how many carbs they'll be consuming and given an insulin-to-carb ratio provided by their doctor, they would deliver the proper amount of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0My son for example takes 1 unit of fast acting insulin (Novolog in his case) for each 15 grams of carbs he consumes. Theoretically, when you are carb-counting such as my son, you can eat as many carbs as you want as long as you \"cover\" them with insulin.One thing that was most helpful to us, especially at the beginning, was getting a Carb Counting book, one for fresh foods, packaged foods, etc. that you would purchase in the grocery store and then another one used for dining out.\u00a0\u00a0There's one that covers most of the major fast food chains as well as some of the\u00a0\u00a0larger eat-in restaurants.\u00a0\u00a0These can be most helpful as you learn to 'guesstimate', which I promise you will learn to do!I wanted to give you an example of what a 75 carb dinner might look like.1-1/2 C. spaghetti with 1/2 C. sauce\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a060 gr.1 dinner roll\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 15 gr.3 meat balls (\u00a0\u00a01 oz. ea. )\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0 gr.Salad with oil/vinegar dressing\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0 gr.At your doctor visit, as if they have a nutritionist/dietician who you and your husband can work with to plan out some meals.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure others will come and offer their own suggestions, but bottom line it takes some learning and working with the doctor to figure out the best insulin to carb ratio for your husband.Best of luck and let us know how you all are progressing!",

            "answer": "Yes to everything that JHG has posted.Also, it's not uncommon that we diabetics feel hungry when our blood sugars are not yet under control.\u00a0\u00a0Until we get our blood sugars back into more normal ranges, our cells are, literally, starving.\u00a0\u00a0The weight loss you hubby has experienced is the result of his cells having been starving for a while.Probably you were given blood test meter & strips so your hubby can begin to recognize patterns of how he feels relative to his blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Encourage him to drink plenty of water or other non-sugary, non-caffeinated beverages with & between meals.\u00a0\u00a0Often we think we're hungry, when really we're thirsty.Adding protein & fats to his meals and including them in snacks is great, as JHG has explained.\u00a0\u00a0Once your hubby gets his insulin routine and blood sugars under good control, and once he understands how his particular system responds to life (stress, exercise, illness, food, etc.) he can pretty much eat what he wants.\u00a0\u00a0I say \"pretty much,\" because none of us would be healthy -- diabetic or not -- on a fast food, high fat, sugary meal plan.\u00a0\u00a0However, if hubby's food interests are reasonable, a good Certified DIabetes Educator (working as part of your diabetes team with your endo) will be able to teach you how to incorporate the foods & beverages he likes into the new way of eating.There's lots to learn, do be patient.\u00a0\u00a0While an a1c is very high, it *could* be worse.\u00a0\u00a0My experience is that folks who embrace what we need to do to FEEL good, will also naturally lower our a1cs.\u00a0\u00a0It takes time, however.\u00a0\u00a0And it takes time for our bodies to FEEL GOOD at good numbers -- after enduring life at high numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Feeling good at good numbers will come gradually as he experiences more good numbers on a regular basis.There are plenty of stresses on you, now, too.\u00a0\u00a0Hubby is fortunate to have your involvement and your concern.\u00a0\u00a0He may not always *like* it, however ;-)\u00a0\u00a0especially when his blood sugars are not good.\u00a0\u00a0Try to be patient with him and yourself ... this disease requires \"marathon\" skills; not \"sprint\" skills, so keep the long-term in mind.Good luck!",

    "question": "My husband is a newly diagnosed Type 1 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0He just got out of the hospital with ketoacidosis and had an HA1C of 12.1.\u00a0\u00a0His sugars ranged from 160 - 380.\u00a0\u00a0We had this checked 6 months ago and everything came out \"normal.\"\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, he is now on insulin, but we are having a hard time figuring out the whole diet thing.\u00a0\u00a0He has been put on a 75 carb/meal diet.\u00a0\u00a0He is 6'3\" and weighed 150 lbs at the hospital, so he actually needs to put on weight.\u00a0\u00a0He is eating the carbs appropriately, but is still hungry.\u00a0\u00a0What can he eat and still stay within the diet.\u00a0\u00a0Can he have more meat or vegetables????\u00a0\u00a0Can he have a snack?\u00a0\u00a0And what about all this sugar free stuff - it still has carbs??\u00a0\u00a0We're so confused!\u00a0\u00a0We're going to the doctor tomorrow and are going to the education classes as soon as we can, but I wanted to get some advice from some of you who have dealt with this for a while.\u00a0\u00a0My dad's a Type 2 diabetic, but this is so different with the insulin shots and such.\u00a0\u00a0My husband's under the impression that as long as he's taking the shots, he can pretty much eat what he wants.....but I know this is probably not right.\u00a0\u00a0I just hate to see him hungry when he doesn't need to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0UGH!!!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any advice.",
