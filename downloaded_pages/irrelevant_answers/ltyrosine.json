            "answer": "Hi tooter! I think the best thing to do is call your doctor and ask which specific meds you need to stop. Usually they just want you to stop blood thinners like aspirin, coumadin, and plavix. This is to prevent excess bleeding during surgery. Usually you need to take your blood pressure, heart and diabetic medicine. You do not take insulin or diabetes pills on the day of the surgery when you are not eating after midnight. DO take the BP with a small sip of water.\u00a0\u00a0Call your doctor tomorrow ok honey! God bless.",

    "question": "My surgery is the 16th. As you know you have to stop all meds and supplements a week before. I was wondering if it would hurt to try l tyrosine? How long does it stay in your body? I've got to do something about my depression.\u00a0\u00a0That's one of the reasons why I took the pills long after they quit working.",
