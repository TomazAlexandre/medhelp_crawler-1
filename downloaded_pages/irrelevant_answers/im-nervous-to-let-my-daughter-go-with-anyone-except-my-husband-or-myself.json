            "answer": "I just read your post about your concerns over your daughter. I think this is totally normal for the first year or so. I too am diabetic and was diagnosed at the age of 15. I am now 39. I have lead a very healthy lifestyle and always managed to maintain myself well. However there have been times when I have not been able to prevent hypos and have haad to have some sort of intervention from a parent or friend. So in actual fact you being nervous will probably be a lifetime thing. She is your daughter and you are going to always want to know she is fine and OK. My mother and I had to at the age of 18 or so make decisions about how I was gonna attend uni away from home without being a danger to myself and also without causing her too much agony. We simply made the arrangement that every morning I would call her a 8am and if I didnt she called my university warden to let themself into my room and check on me. I would also then call her in the evening around 5ish and then finally at 10pm. Sounds a lot but it certainly kept me safe and well at uni. My pals all knew what to do in the event of me taking a hypo. I guess you learn so much more as you get older and your daughter will find that she gets to know exactly what the early symptoms of a hypo are.In short, you are right to worry at the moment but as long as your daughter monitors her blood glucose levels well and always has a sugary drink like lucozade on her she will be fine. I suppose to some extent my mother went of the rails with the checking up on me and as a result I have a somewhat hemmed in life. Even at the age of 39 today, I still call my parents each morning at 8am and last thing at night!!!! Hope this helps.How old is your daughter and is she coping well with her condition?Britgirl477",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 11my mom normally let me go out.....she just made sure I was able to call and get in touch with her in case something went wrongYou never said how old your daughter was in your post If shes younger like 11-12 yeah I could proably understand your situation. When she starts getting older like 13-15she is going to want to go out more most likely with her friends (this is only natural)If she is going to go out out just\u00a0\u00a0make sure she has all of the supplies she needs to take care of her diabetes including something for low blood sugar.make her get into the habbit of packinmg all this before she leaves......Also since this has been a big concern for you\u00a0\u00a0you should search for a support group forParents of daibetes in your area",

    "question": "I have been feeling a lot of anxiety over letting my daughter go anywhere without my husband or myself for the last eight months since she was diagnosed. All of her grandparents went to the training classes to learn what to do to care for her but the majority of them are scared to care for her at all and the one grandparent that does take initiative to want to take her places by herself really makes me nervous. I don't know if this is just me or if a lot of other parents have this same sort of paralyzing anxiety. Everyone tells me it's not that big of a deal and that I should learn to let go but I don't feel ready. I have let my daughter go with her grandmother without me for overnight trips and I have such extreme anxiety that it ruins the break for me and my husband. Should I follow my gut here or \"Learn to let go?\"",
