            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The symptoms of chest pain can be due to the old pain coming up\u2014this could have been costochondritis (inflammation of the joint between rib and sternum). The other possibility is withdrawal symptoms due to quitting smoking. This also precipitates gastritis which can add to your existing chest pain. The whole body pain, joint pains, fatigue, paresthesia (feeling a cold back) can all be due to withdrawal os smoking.However you also need to rule out diabetes and hypothyroidism.Hope this helps. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 33 female who quit smoking 4 days ago. I smoked for 16 years (on and off as I had 2 pregnancy and did not smoke during pregnancy). I smoked approximately 10-12 cigs a day (give or take). Shortly after my 2nd son was born (he must of been about 3 or 4 months old) I started getting these chest pains. They would only occur when I did certain movements. Otherwise I did not feel it. The pain went away (not even sure when) but recently they have come back. This time I attempted to stretch, poke etc... nothing worked to make it go away. All I think I have done is hurt myself more and now I have shoulder pain, some back pain (all on the right side, same as the chest pain). I do have a bit of shortness of breath but I think it is mostly brought on by anxiety as when I am not thinking about my breathing I am fine - it is only when I start panicking or think about breathing does the shortness of breath seem to appear. Today I also experienced a cold back when I got up. I thought I was going crazy. Not sure if this is related to quitting smoking or the chest pain. Any help would be great...",
