            "answer": "Unfortunately you can't make him take care of himself.\u00a0\u00a0Ask him why he doesn't want to grow old with you?\u00a0\u00a0Then you can say his actions show that he doesn't and maybe this will give him a new perpsective on things.\u00a0\u00a0Then just back off, so long as YOU are worrying about his health he won't!\u00a0\u00a0Some people are just this way, and he will notice when you stop worrying.\u00a0\u00a0Tell him he's a big boy and has choices to make, either to take care of himself and live a long life with you or not.\u00a0\u00a0Put it all on him and I think you will see a change.\u00a0\u00a0I know this is difficult to do, but I had to do this with my husband and his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0When I stopped worrying and nagging him, he started taking good care of himself because it was now in his hands.\u00a0\u00a0You'll make yourself sick worrying over him when he doesn't care enough to help himself!\u00a0\u00a0Just back off and leave him to think about things, but don't tell him this is what you're doing. I don't feel his nipple is related to his diabetes, he needs to see his doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Again, let it be, you can't help someone who doesn't want to be helped.\u00a0\u00a0He is being selfish in making you worry so much about him, and he may not want to hear about it, but I'll bet when his body starts talking.....he'll listen! Tell him this, and that you are done worrying yourself sick when he isn't trying to help himself.\u00a0\u00a0Then let it go!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and take care.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your responce,it is greatly appreciated.This morning he was in the kitchen and he went to throw away an empty insulin tube and he just shook,he come back and said that he can't hold on to anything anymore.I did however tell him that this was from his dabetis and that it was nerve damage.He never said a word. He has been really quiet today,yesterday he had a very bad headache which made him sick to his stomach all day.about 17 yrs ago he had a car accident and there are some vertibras that are not in good shape they told him at the time that there was a 50/50 chance that he would never walk again if he was operated on and he said that he wasn't having Surgery.So now he sleeps on the sofa,in his lazy boy chair sometimes in his office chair and very few times in the bed because he gets really bad Headaches,and now he is dealing with Diabetis.He told me that his father had the same problem with his nipple being sore and swollen and that there was a substance like milk that came out,I have worked in the medical field some and I have never heard of this froma man,only women with mastitis. He is not very happy these days and its because if his health and you are right in saying to just let him think about things on his own, I have shown not to care to much and he just wil say yournot the same as before. Egyptian women Baby their men,me on the other hand will to a point but he has to help himself first.",

            "answer": "\"why his Urine is frothy?,like he was a soda bottle and you shook him up\"Frothy urine can be due to albumin spilling into the urine. Albumin is a protein like egg whites - you whip egg whites and they get frothy - if you spill albumin into you urine, when you pee it froths. Some people just do this but in a person with diabetes you have to first check to see if they are getting kidney complications.He needs to go see his doctor for a complete workup.And, I agree with mammo - an adult has to take responsibility for own care. But, you might want to go ahead and make the appointment with his physician and tell him to go and go now. Be sure the physician is aware he needs to be seen very soon - diabetic, headaches, and frothy urine with possible infection.\u00a0\u00a0(Men have breast tissue too - just not as much as women - and can have the same problems with breasts. Just don't hear about it as much.)",
