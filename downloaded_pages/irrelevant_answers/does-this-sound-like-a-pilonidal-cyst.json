            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!What you have is probably just a boil or abscess. This can also make the area very tender and painful and if you squeeze it there will be pus. However, it could also be pilonidal sinus.You probably know that Pilonidal sinus are known for their recurrence. It is necessary to keep the area free of hair and infection. Laser pilation of hair in adjoining area is also necessary along with the surgery to close the sinus. If you are a smoker, you need to stop smoking to facilitate healing. Also check if you have diabetes. This could be the cause for low grade infection resulting in recurrence.Rarely the sinus affects the spine and causes neurological symptoms.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult a doctor and please do not ignore it further. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi there,I am a 22 year old male, physically ft (work in the armed forces), and healthy.I have been experiencing tenderness towards the top of my butt crack. This evening I checked it again and the 'bump' (for better want of a word) had become white - similar to that of a ***** pimple - but remained relatively small in size. It then leaked a large amount of off white puss which smelt foul. It is still tender to sit.I have put off visiting the med centre as this may result in my adverse consequenes in relation to my employment. I am planning to go to a local doctor asap.Do these symptoms suggest a potential pilonidal cyst? What are the long term potential adverse health outcomes in regards to mobility and physical strength/fitness?Thank you.",
