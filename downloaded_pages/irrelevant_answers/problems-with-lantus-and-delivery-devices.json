Check them out and also check for others responses to your post.\u00a0\u00a0I would most definitely speak to your endocrinologist after doing some research and I am certain that between the two of you can come up with a regime that works well for you.Best of luck!",

            "answer": "I use Lantus cartridges in a Humalog pen. And it works perfectly. For me, a major benefit of switching from NPH to Lantus has been\u00a0\u00a0the reduced variability in action. And delivery via the Humalog pen appears to be very consistent.Mark",

    "question": "I want to find out if you are having problems with consistent dose delivery using an Aventis Optipen plus or an Owen Mumford Autompen or stability of the insulin once out of the fridgeAlso have any of you contacted the manufacturers - Sanofi Aventis or Owen Mumford about this?I have been on insulin for nearly 38 years and am lucky enough to have no complications so believe I have managed my control pretty well.\u00a0\u00a0However since starting to use Lantus (and I was one of the first users in the UK) I have stopped having real problems with hypos but have had great problems with consistency of delivery.\u00a0\u00a0 I want to find out whether this is just me (and I do not think so) and how many other diabetics are having similar problems and what they are doing about it.I look forward to hearing your thoughtsThank youDiana",
