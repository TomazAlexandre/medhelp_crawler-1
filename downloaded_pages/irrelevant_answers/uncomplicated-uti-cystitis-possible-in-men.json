            "answer": "To answer your questions:1) It is possible for prostatitis to present with an enlarged prostate.\u00a0\u00a0However, this may not always be the case, as the DRE is not a terribly sensitve test.2) Yes, it can be possible for a man to have an uncomplicated UTI.\u00a0\u00a0However, this is relatively uncommon and things like STDs and prostatitis should be ruled out.3) It is possible to have kidney stones without symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It can be located anywhere along the urinary tract, depending on how far it has been excreted.4) A worsening of the immune system can certainly cause you to be more susceptible to a UTI.5) I would certainly discuss these issues with a urologist.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "I am a male, 44 years old, non-smoker (quit 10 years ago), normal height/weight.Three evenings ago, I had the sudden onset of these symptoms:- VERY frequent urination, often with little volume- sensation that bladder never voided completely- painful, burning feeling in urethra when urinating- sensation of sligh pressure between anus and penisOther details:- no fever (brief, slight fever yesterday, but the temperature where I live was 100 degrees and I have no air conditioning). No fever this morning.- slight ache in the lower left back - more on the side of my waist than where the kidneys are located (I know where they are)- no nausea or vomitingI visited my Dr. promptly the morning after the symptoms started. I suspected UTI, and after describing symptoms, so did he.He:- examined all around my abdomen and pubic area (no discomfort felt)- examined my back, especially where the ribs meet the spine (no discomfort felt)- did a DRE - prostate not enlarged (I had a DRE in my physical five months ago, which was also normal, and my PSA was around 1.0)- sent me for urinalysis and blood test (kidney function and diabetes) - results not yet available- prescribed 1000mg CIPRO daily (10 days) + Uristat for three daysHaving tried to read up as much as possible on UTIs, I note that this far more common in women than men. Many sources of information state that if a man presents with UTI, then it is almost always \"complicated\" and other tests should be performed.My questions are:1) would prostatitis result in an enlarged prostate that would be noticeable with DRE?2) is it possible for a man to have an uncomplicated UTI (like cystitis) that resolves with antibiotics, requiring no further investigation?3) My Dr. suggested the possibility of kidney stones (my father had them) but I feel no sharp pains. Can you have kidney stones without feeling them? Where are they most likely to be located in the urinary tract?4) I have been averaging 4-5 hours sleep a night for many months as my wife and I have young twins. Could chronic sleep deprivation and subsequent consequences on the immune system be a sound reason for developing a UTI?5) Is referral to a urologist essential if this resolves? Or only if it recurs?It's been 48 hours since I started taking the meds, and my urinary frequency is down, and the burning sensation is lessened. I feel better, but not 100%. I expect in a couple of more days I will be feeling a lot better. I have been resting at home the past few days.Thank you in advance for your help.",
