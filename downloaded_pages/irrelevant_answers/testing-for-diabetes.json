It can often help to keep notes for a while on how you're feeling at different times of day, your activity levels, foods, stresses, emotions, etc.\u00a0\u00a0We can use that info with our docs to help identify patterns that they can help us interpret and/or treat.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Yes, a complete random blood test would surely have shown high glucose levels, for glucose counts are one of the most common things tested in random non-specific bloodwork. Do continue to talk to your doctor, though, about symptoms that aren't normal, and be specific about what they are.",
