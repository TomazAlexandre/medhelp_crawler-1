            "answer": "Personally...i would skip. My appts were unevetful even with cervix checks. You know when and when not to go to the hospital if your in labor. Yes its nice to know there is progress but its not crucial or anything, also if you havent done gbs test then theyll probably do that soon",

    "question": "Im 37+2 so I have started my weekly appointments, i go every Thursday and this Thursday ill be 37+4. Thing is, i don't think I will be able to make it bc my car had some problems so I had to get that fixed bc I didn't wanna be carless if I can go into labor any day..so I will not have the money to pay for the appointment until Saturday but they won't open Saturday or sunday until monday, and I dont see a point in rescheduling for monday and then go again next Thursday which is three days later, so I dont know if I should just wait until next Thursday And skip this weeks appointment but im scared to not go and miss something.. I dont know what to do here, theres really only one person I could borrow the money from until Saturday but I dont wanna ask him (my younger brother) so im wondering what would you guys do?",
