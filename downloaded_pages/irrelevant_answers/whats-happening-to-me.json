            "answer": "Sounds a lot like a UTI to me. It is very common to have this kind of problem,\u00a0\u00a0especially if you just recently started having sex. You absolutely need to see a doctor for antibiotics. If you are in college, try the campus health clinic.\u00a0\u00a0If not, and you are scared to tell your parents,\u00a0\u00a0schedule an appointment for a physical or some other reason.",

    "question": "I have started to have a horrible stench to my urine. So bad that it is embarrassing to use the restroom in public or even at my home. It's horribly terrible! It smells like rotten eggs or something. I have also started to not be able to hold my urine for any time at all when i feel it i have to go then or it feels like I might well **** myself. I don't know what it could be. I did some online research, says stop drinking juices so water was the only choice and that's not working. I'm scared. I'm young just turned 18 and I believe that my body has gone through enough changes. I have been able to talk to my mom about the rest but this one just seems abnormal and I'm scared she'll think it's something like STDs or something(i do not have STDs). So if there is any explanation to any of this i would be so thankful.This discussion is related to/posts/Urogynecology/bad-smelling-urine/show/280145.",
