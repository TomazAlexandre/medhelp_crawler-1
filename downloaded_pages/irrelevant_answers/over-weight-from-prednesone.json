            "answer": "I have successfully lost 35 lbs in 5 months while on pred and with limited mobility (ie little to no movement and no exercise) with the low carb/low fat dukan diet.\u00a0\u00a0I also eat 6 very small snack-size meals per day to keep me full all day rather than 3 larger meals.\u00a0\u00a0Check with your doc first before doing it and make sure you drink the recommended amount of water if not more since the first 2 phases can be harder on the kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0Slow going with no exercise and working against the pred, but at least my weight is going in the right direction so I will take it. :)",
