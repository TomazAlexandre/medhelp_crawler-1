Try having activities that keep your mind busy, like reading, decorating the babys room... and keep smiling, your mind will think you are happy and it will make you feel a bit happier.",

    "question": "ftm and 31 weeks 4 days. Lately, I have been feeling very very lonely. Guess its mostly due to the hormones but my mother in law and husband are doing their best to frustrate me. Both of them make me feel terribly lonely and left out. I have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes. But none of them seem to be bothered about my health or my emotions. Feeling like a non existent person in my own house. :(I try thinking about the baby and reminding myself that its just another few weeks. But sometimes none of those efforts help.It will be great help if any of you could suggest some ways to stay positive for the next 8 weeks until i meet my baby! Really looking for some advice..",
