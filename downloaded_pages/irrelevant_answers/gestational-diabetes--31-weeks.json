I used a pen injection at night.\u00a0\u00a0It was not painful.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor continued to increase my amount up until delivery.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting numbers were always high.\u00a0\u00a0The good part of it all was the added monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0Extra ultrasounds to monitor her size meant I saw her often.\u00a0\u00a0I also had NST twice a week which meant hearing her heartbeat more often.\u00a0\u00a0She did great throughout the pregnancy!!\u00a0\u00a0I was also to be induced early to ensure she wasn't too big but she came on her own.\u00a0\u00a0The nurses/doctors monitored her blood sugars for the first 12 hours after birth but she had no problems.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and let me now if you need more information.",

            "answer": "Hi,I also had diabetes during my pregnancy with my daughter.\u00a0\u00a0I was on insulin from about 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter was fine and born at 38 weeks (naturally) and weighed 7 lbs and 3 oz.Now I am trying to have another baby and am on insulin already.Your risk of developing diabetes in the future is quite high so this can also be an advance warning that you'll need to manage your blood sugars carefully from now on, even if you get off insulin after the pregnancy.Actually, insulin makes things a lot easier to manage than just with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Be very strict about monitoring and try to eat lower carb.\u00a0\u00a0Control your blood sugar well and your baby will be fine.You can PM me if you want some more information or have more questions, or else reply to this thread, which i'll add to my wathc list..",

            "answer": "Thanks for the wonderful information ladies! I have to do one injection at night because my fasting numbers are too high. The rest of my numbers throughout the day have been fine and easily maintained with my diet. I do miss all those carbs and sugars ~ especially at the very end of the pregnancy but I will do whatever is best for my little girl!!Thanks again for all the insight!xxoo",

    "question": "Hey ladies! I hope everyone is feeling/doing good!!!I am 31 weeks and was recently diagnoised with Gestational Diabetes. I have been unable to control it with diet only so I start on insulin injections today.\u00a0\u00a0I am very disappointed that I will have to be insulin dependent. This whole thing has been very stressful and overwhelming. Just curious if anyone else is going through this as well. Any advice or encouragement would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!! xxoo",
