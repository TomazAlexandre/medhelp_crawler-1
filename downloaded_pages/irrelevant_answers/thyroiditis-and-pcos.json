            "answer": "Well, it sounds like you've been through the wringer already.\u00a0\u00a0Nice to meet you.\u00a0\u00a0I am the one Cheryl was talking about.I have not thyroid thanks to Graves' Disease, PCOS, diabetes and a host of other illnesses that don't matter much to this.\u00a0\u00a0You are not crazy, these are horrible diseases one at a time, much less all together.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately they tend to run that way.For PCOS they usually like you on a strong BCP.\u00a0\u00a0They put me on a mild one b/c of my age and past history of smoking plus all my other illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0Am also on Metformin, 500mg 2X daily.\u00a0\u00a0The Metformin has taken care of most of the PCOS symtoms.\u00a0\u00a0I only have to shave my face every couple of weeks now :-P the acne has gotten better and the hair loss has seemed to stop.\u00a0\u00a0The hairloss is from the thyroid and insulin resistance.You didn't give your thyroid levels and I would be really interested to see them with their ranges.\u00a0\u00a0Don't trust a dr when they say they're \"normal\".\u00a0\u00a0Their idea and mine are 2 completely different things.When you go for your pap you need to also have an intra-vaginal ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0Fun, huh?\u00a0\u00a0Not too bad.\u00a0\u00a0To see how bad the cysts are and to make sure none of them look suspicious.Have been doing some research in the last 2 weeks about the levo and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Levothyroxine can give you diabetes and should not be taken with Metformin and some other drugs I can't really remember right now.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on levo for many years now and believe it is the reason I am such a bad diabetic at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your endo about this.\u00a0\u00a0Also wouldn't hurt to consult your pharmacist.\u00a0\u00a0That's what I'm going to do.\u00a0\u00a0Don't have an endo anymore.\u00a0\u00a0Kinda like your PCP.Also talk to the gyn about endometriosis.\u00a0\u00a0Am going to a new gyno(had it out with the last one and fired him) on the 9th about possible endometriosis.\u00a0\u00a0When you read up on it lots and lots of autoimmune--AI--patients have it.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid sites tell you the endome is b/c of the AI thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0Go to the endome site and they will tell you that it comes first thus causing the AI thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a06 of 1, 1/2 dozen the other.\u00a0\u00a0Ask about it.Would DEFINITELY have the lymph node and chest problem ultrasounded (?)\u00a0\u00a0That sounds weird. lolThe main thing with all these drs is to stand your ground and never let them tell you how it's going to be.\u00a0\u00a0You are so young and have a lot of life and you want it to be the best it can be, so fight hard for good health and don't let them bully you around.\u00a0\u00a0Took me a lot of years to get to this point.\u00a0\u00a0Fight until you find drs you can get along with and will work together for your health.Good luck and if there's anything I have left out or if you have any questions just let me know.\u00a0\u00a0You may have to PM me, b/c I don't get over here as much as I'd like to now.Dac",

Have you tried them?\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned about having diabetes ( i am pre-diabetic), and am really sorry to hear you have to struggle with that as well, as i have watched a few women in my family deal with that. If taking levothyroxine is instigating the diabetes situation , i would like to avoid it.My thyroid levels are all over the place.\u00a0\u00a0Up down up down. Anyways, they are around 4 right now, so the endo increased the levo--i had blood work done about 2.5 months ago, and am due back in about another 1.5 months.\u00a0\u00a0The endo said that she wants my TSH around 1.I have been told by a previous gyn that i may have endometriosis, so i\u00a0\u00a0will def. talk to them when i go for my pap at the end of april.I know a lot of women in our situation struggle with weight, and that controlling your weight will help with symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Easier said than done.\u00a0\u00a0I have heard low carb and/or vegan is the way to go--with lots of exercise mixed in.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know anyone that can attest to this lifestyle?I'll just leave it at that for now.\u00a0\u00a0Could go on forever!\u00a0\u00a0From one girl to another, I seriously hope you are able to manage all of these health issues as best as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you both!BTW,\u00a0\u00a0would my posts better suit another message board?Gem",

    "question": "Hi,I have been diagnosed with Hypothyroidism due to hashimoto's thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0I usually see a nurse practitioner at the endocrinology specialists office. She seems to be controlling my TSH (bloods tests include free T4 and TSH, and she orders a comprehensive metabolic panel) pretty well, as I feel much better in that respect.\u00a0\u00a0At my last visit, she had tested my hormone levels and told me that she thinks I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (I have elevated testosterone levels, was losing hair despite having my thyroid levels being maintained at a normal level, skin darkening, abdominal pain, insulin resistance, acne, heavy periods/irregular periods, etc..).\u00a0\u00a0I am going to see a OBGYN within the next three weeks for a routine pap.\u00a0\u00a0I was told by the nurse practitioner that I should also take my blood work with me to show the gynecologist when I get my pap, so that he can recommend an oral contraceptive that better suits a person with pcos.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, I am taking Ortho Tri Cyclen Lo to regulate testosterone, Metformin for Insulin resistance and levothyroxine for Hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0With that said, I have never had a thyroid ultrasound, and have had a hard, fixed right supraclavicular lymph node for about 8 months.\u00a0\u00a0It is about the size of a pea, and I have been told that it is not considered enlarged.\u00a0\u00a0All the doctor's I have seen (pcp, endo, gastroentorologist), have said they will keep an eye on it.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having pain in my throat, above and around my thyroid for the past year and a half, back pain and crackling and popping noises in my upper chest that happen at various times through out the day.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't hurt, but it feels like there is some sort of pressure release--it doesn't seem like it is originating from my back bones or my sternum.\u00a0\u00a0I don't find it difficult to breath, but do feel as if my heart jumps every so often, and randomly feel like fainting during aerobic exercise.\u00a0\u00a0After all of that, I have two questions:A.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think I should have an ultrasound of my thyroid and the node?B.\u00a0\u00a0Should I have the chest thing checked out?I haven't felt well for the past two years and am finally feeling better.\u00a0\u00a0The reason I want to have these things checked is because I would like to prevent any more problems in the future. I have had an overwhelming amount of symptoms from the hypothyroidism and pcos, and a few side affects from the medications.\u00a0\u00a0This led to a bad experience with my Primary care physician.\u00a0\u00a0She made me feel as if wash being a hypochondriac. I am happy to have finally found out what is happening with my body, thanks to my endo.\u00a0\u00a0However, I am still concerned about the node and my chest.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid to bring up my true concerns with my endo and my gyno, for fear of them just brushing me off like my primary care physician had done.\u00a0\u00a0it is very frustrating.Thanks for you help,gemtonic",
