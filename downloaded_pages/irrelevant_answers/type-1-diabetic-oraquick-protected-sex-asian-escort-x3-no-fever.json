    "question": "My 3 exposures were all last year, the most recent was in mid October and all of them entailed protected oral (receptive) and protected sex.\u00a0\u00a0The condoms did not break in any of these instances.\u00a0\u00a0At 12 weeks (since last incident) I had an Oraquick Advanced done which was negative.\u00a0\u00a0I have however been experiencing unusual symptoms for me which have been going on for a while.\u00a0\u00a0It started off with a terrible sore throat, now that has mostly gone away.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have a very red unsore throat, still white tonsils, sweaty hands and feet and soreness under my right arm and jaw also burning in left hand. I am not sure if it is involved with lymph nodes or not.1) I do finger stick tests for diabetes, is it possible that when I removed the condom with my hand I may have had her virginal fluid enter my skin through one of these recent finger stick sites?2) When I preformed the Oraquick Advanced test he gave me instructions after I had already swiped my inside cheek, then he told me to get my gums.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried that I did not perform the test correctly.\u00a0\u00a0Is it true that the Oraquick Advanced internal control will let you know if a correct mucosal trasnduate sample is not added?3) Lastly is it possible that because I have diabetes (type 1) last H1AC was 7.6 (not so good) and that I balance my own thyroid (with syntrhtoid) that I may be a late converter?\u00a0\u00a0I am really sorry if I repeated any question others may have asked or if I am crazy for being worried.\u00a0\u00a0I can't control my concern at this point, it seems to control me.",
