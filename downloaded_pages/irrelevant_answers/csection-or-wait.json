Unfortunately if nothing is happening by next wk, I would go for the Section as much as you don't want it. This way you won't miss any of your family events and won't have any trouble with delivery. I hear moat inductions end up in c section anyway",

A doc told me that my son was breech and offered c-section in a way that sounded like he was expecting me to be like \"yay, yes please\" and I yelled at him to turn him even if it hurt me etc. If it were me and it stays safe I'd wait until Monday. I've heard that nipple stimulation has been proven to help but I've always been induced so I don't know from personal experience.",

I could wait and see if I labor on my own but then theres a chance he will be too big and still need a Csection.my last ultrasound was about 2weeks ago and he was around 6lb 5oz but the Dr thinks he may now be around 8lb. I've only gained about 1 1/2 lb since then so Idk if they will check again or just try to push for the Csection",

            "answer": "I was asked today if I wanted a c-section also, I have no problem with my pregnancy the only thing is im not dilated, so I understand where your coming from. did you ask your doctor what the risks are if you wait another week if you have diabetes? And Did your doctor check the baby's weight through an ultrasound or just an estimated guess?? because my doctor told me that even if she guesses its not always right. I understand that your trying to avoid a c-section because believe me I am going to the same thing!!! but my advise is maybe just wait and see if the baby wants to come out naturally, and even if he is bigger and you have to get a c-section just be thankful that his healthy! I decided to wait and I'm leaving everything in God's hands. so hopefully you can decide on whatever decision you think would be best for you and the baby:) good luck!",

She delivered my last baby and I really like her but it just seemed like the other Dr that I have been discussing the whole vbac plan with has been so much more supportive. I'm due April 4 and she basically said if I'm not dilated Monday (3/30) we should set up a Csection date and that we can do it either Tues or Wed of that week. I won't even be 40 weeks yet, so it just felt to me that she didn't think I could do it and just wanted to do it the quicker way. Idk",

She tried to force a finger into my cervix but she couldn't but maybe things will change between now and Thursday. I doubt it. Very disappointed about this but I'll get over it.

My Dr gave me the option to have a Csection either Tuesday or Wednesday next week if I haven't dilated as of Monday. I wanted to attempt a vbac, but was told unless I dilate she can't start pitocin or break my water. i dont want to wait too long because I have gestational diabetes and he will just get bigger.Idk what I should do. I don't want to miss Easter with NYC kids and my youngest has his 1st bday on the 8th. What would u do if in this situation?",
