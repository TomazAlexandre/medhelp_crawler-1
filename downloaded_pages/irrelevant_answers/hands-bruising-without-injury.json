            "answer": "I Agree with \"liyswanl\" you need to see a doc and get some blood ran, My guess is that you have weak vains and they are breaking causing the bruising. This can be caused by many things but one of them is just a simple Diet change or like a one a day vitamin, Others are not so nice and could lead to not normal bleeding, like in your guts or stomach and may go without being known witch could lead to vary bad ends.See your Doc and have them test your blood as soon as you can that's my advice.David M.",

            "answer": "Hi! If the bruising disappeared while you were off from work, then in all probability you have contact dermatitis due to something that your hand touches. Wear gloves during work and see if it helps. If still you get bruises then it can be due to fragile capillaries and you may need to test for diabetes and thyroid disorders. Take care!",

    "question": "I work on an assembly line in a plant so I use my hands constantly....my hands don't really hurt more than would be expected, but they are getting covered in big dark ugly bruises...I haven't hit them on anything, so I was wondering if just the repetition can cause bruising? Should I get looked at? I don't really like doctors or their prices, so I would rather not unless it is absolutely necessary...but the bruising has my husband worried...I was out of work for almost 2 weeks and then I returned to work this week and the bruising occurs...there are 2 large bruises on my left hand one right above my wrist and another right below my index finger, the bruises are very dark and sore...my right hand only has light bruising starting at my thumb area and stretching over to right under my middle finger...As I said this area has only light bruising but is swollen more so than the left hand...Anyway any answers will be appreciated. Thank you all.",
