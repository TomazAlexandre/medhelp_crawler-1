            "answer": "hi eleanorrose - so sorry that this dropped to page 2 so fast.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't see your question until tonight.If it were me, I would avoid the chiropractor until you know for sure what you are dealing with.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been able to see a specialist? the types of symptoms you have described could be neurological and seeing a neurologist would be in order.The way you describe the feelings moving all over, takes it out of the probably MS typical symptoms, but only a neurologist can make that final determination.stay in touch - but please don't get your neck/spine manipulated until you know what is going on .best, Lulu",
