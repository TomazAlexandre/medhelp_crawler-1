            "answer": "During September, I also had incidents where I'd wake up cold and sweating and I'd be very pale, extremely hungry and dehydrated. I weighed myself previously before I fell asleep and woke up like that and I somehow lost 3~4 lbs during that 4 hour period. This happened only three times but I remember being really tired, dazed, weak, sweating, and cold.",

    "question": "I've had these symptoms, ones that started early September:-Extremely Thirsty-Had to pee a lot-Really tired.By November:-I don't feel as thirsty, although I don't realize I'm dehydrated until it's too the point of me not being able to swallow.-Headaches/flushed skin/fevers after I eat-Sometimes I get really hot feeling after I eat as well-Stomach aches-Pain in upper stomach usually-extremely tired no matter how much I sleep-I pee a little bit less-Foamy urine/ It has bubbles in it and before it didn't (I don't eat a lot of protein).-I've been eating more and my weight seems to be going down slowly-Vision is getting worse-Leg cramps even when I just sit down,-Tingly/stinging hands and feet-Really hungry lately-Lower back pain-really slow healing cuts-Extremely weak, I get tired after walking up stairs and I cannot exercise at all. Before September though I was a really really strong athlete and I worked out daily and was always energetic.In September I've been tested for mono, diabetes, anemia, kidney failure and a whole bunch of other things.All turned out negative.My friend tests my blood sugar and during September it was usually pretty low, 3.5~4.1. This is before I eat, now it's gotten up to 6.7 before I eat.I don't know if this is important, but my blood has lost its metallic taste, although I'm not anemic or anything.There was a few other incidents in which I would get extremely hot, thirsty, and tired, during this time I also had a light sweet taste in my mouth even when I didn't eat. This happened twice. And when I had a cut just a few days ago, the blood tasted similar to that sweet taste I had in my mouth.My doctors think it's all psychological and I'm being sent to a psychiatrist, and they also believe that a brain tumor might be a problem as well. Although I don't believe I have one, because of all the other problems.I'm a 15 year old female, 16 in April, I'm average weight, I eat healthy, no excessive sugar or junkfoods.Although I feel worse after eating highcarbohydrates and sometimes the occasional high sugar food, although it's usually from some fruits.",
