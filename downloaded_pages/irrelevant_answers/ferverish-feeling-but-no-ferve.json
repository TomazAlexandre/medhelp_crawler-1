            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Post viral fatigue syndrome is probably what you have and this is a very common disorder after viral infections. Also there are no magic pills for it. This can be treated patiently with exercise, good diet, work out plans and multivitamins. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables and proteins should be taken along with a multi vitamin supplement. Eat 5-7 small regular meals every day. Drink plenty of water. Do deep breathing exercises.Feverish feeling is also noticed in anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, dehydration, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",
