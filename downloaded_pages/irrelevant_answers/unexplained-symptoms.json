    "question": "Hi,I've been suffering from an array of unexplained but possibly connected symptoms for about three years now.I have a severe case of scoliosis and about three years ago the rods the used to stabilize my spine became severely infected and had to be removed in an emergency surgery. I was diagnosed with a possible bone infection and spent six months on drugs, included six weeks using a pic line. The drug I was on caused me to develop severe anemia, which I was treated for. But I have experience mild levels of anemia my entire life.Ever since this incident I have been experiencing increasingly worsening symptoms. I am constantly thirsty, it doesn't matter how much water I drink I can't get any relief. Sometimes if I drink pop or a flavored drink that is very cold I can get temporary relief, but it's never for very long. My mouth sometimes feels like its burning or dry. When the thrist goes on long enough I can develop headaches, I'm unable to think clearly and my intestines feel like they are being tied in knots.I also get severe constipation and may not have a bowel movement for a week, and even then I have to take some sort of laxative to get any relief. Even after that, I still feel like I have to go and feel bloated often.Even though I haven't noticed much increased urination even with the increased fluids I take in, when I went to see my primary care physician she tested me for every form of diabetes in the book, all of the tests came back negative. A regular blook work up showed a lower level of white blood cells, but nothing she was concerned about and the rest of the blood work up seemed within normal range. She then suggested hypothyroidism, but the test for this also came back negative. She is stumped and has run out of explanations, and I'm nearing my breaking point and was wondering if you had any ideas.Thanks for everything!",
