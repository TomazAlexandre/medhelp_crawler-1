            "answer": "Your post doesn't provide clear information on what tests your girlfriend had, needs, or is waiting on. Perhaps you can answer some questions in order to make things clearer so we can help you better.\"we are still waiting for further blood test results\"What does \"further blood test results\" mean? Do you mean your girlfriend already had blood test done and why she \"has been told she has diabetes\"? Or, other test were performed but you haven't seen the results yet?If you/her were told \"she has too much sugar and her body is not using it\", it's probably why she is \"suffering from dizziness and numbness in hands skight headache.\" Since the glucose test results were kept a secret we can only assume high glucose levels is causing serious side effects.The more she learns and understands this disease, the better she will be in diabetes control management.

            "answer": "Hi,while waiting for the blood test results and the medications, your girlfriend can start to watch her portion sizes of food she consumes, especially the carbohydrates--which turns into sugar in the body.\u00a0\u00a0Carbohydrates includes grain products (rice, pasta, bread, anything that's made out of flour), juice/regular pop (recommended to completely stay out of these), fruits, milk, yogurt, potatoes, corns, etc.\u00a0\u00a0She should have more vegetables (half of a plate each meal), for the meat (quarter of a plate), grain products are also quarter of a plate.Another thing that your girlfriend can work on is to exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise is considered a free treatment because it makes the cells more sensitive to the insulin ( Insulin is a hormone that acts as a key to the cells, so the sugar can go in==>tranform into energy).\u00a0\u00a0She should do some cardiac workouts such as walking/running, and also resistances training..weight liftings etc.\u00a0\u00a0A combination of these two is more effectively in decreased the blood sugars compared to doing just one.\u00a0\u00a0However, if she doesn't exercise, then she should start slow like start 15 minutes/day and increase from there.The last thing she can do is the monitor her blood sugars, so she has an idea of how high her blood sugars are.\u00a0\u00a0Also the blood tests only provides an idea/average.\u00a0\u00a0her testing results would give a picture of how her sugars are like at a specific time.\u00a0\u00a0Blood sugar before meal should be 4-7mmol/L; 2 hours after meal should be 5-10mmol/L.What you can do is to support her and be her exercise buddy/coach.\u00a0\u00a0So you can make sure she is doing everything she can and also motivates her.When her blood sugar comes down, the numbness and headache should go away, as these are symptoms of high blood sugar.Good luck!",

            "answer": "Best thing a person can do when told they are Diabetic is to contact the local Hospital or Health Department and get signed up for their Diabetes Education class. I learned So much from those classes and they gave me the books to bring home with me.I also read a lot about it online toohttp://www.diabetes.com/http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/intro/index.htmhttp://www.diabetes.org/type-2-diabetes.jsphttp://www.mayoclinic.com/health/type-2-diabetes/DS00585Hope this helpsWhen I was diagnosed i was told to keep my carbs limited to 20 to 25 for a meal and 15 for a snack.Of course the class also taught me about portion control and healthy eatingDrinking lots of waterThe class is the best thing i can advise They let Significant others attend with them too. There is usually a support group in town as wellDo a google search for Diabetes Support groups and add your city and state in the google searchThis is also a good way to locate diabetes education classes in your city",
