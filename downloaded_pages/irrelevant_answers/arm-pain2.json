            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels ( or blood vessel spasms occur due to cold weather/medical condition that block blood flow to the fingers, toes, nose and ears),\u00a0\u00a0excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here in terms of your other associated symptoms like migraine. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "I am a 38 y/o woman with my left arm that has been hurting from the shoulder to the fingertips and been getting worse over the past few weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The whole arm hurts if I lay on my left side too long and it gets very cold, sometimes the hand will look pale.\u00a0\u00a0The pain seems to be centered underneath my upper arm, just below the armpit.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't really seem to be numb, but feels heavy a lot of the time.\u00a0\u00a0Twelve years ago, I dislocated the elbow on that arm and was told I had a pinched nerve in my elbow but that only made my two little fingers go to sleep on occassion.I am wondering if this is a neurological problem or a circulatory one?I do have severe migraines and wondered if this was another symptom of migraine?",
