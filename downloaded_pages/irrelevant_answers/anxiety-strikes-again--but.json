            "answer": "From what I have been told by a gastro doctor,the only time to worry about you stools is when they are very dark in colour as this could indicate a blood content in them.So I think you are ok.Your regularity concern is unfounded as that can be quite normal,and be related to how much fibre you eat and how much exercise you do.I very much doubt your liver\u00a0\u00a0has any problems.What you eat and the medication you take can influence colour and texture of the stools.So try not to worry about it.If you were bleeding from the rectum then I would be concerned!!We anxiety sufferers unfortunately tend to notice every little discrepancy in our bodies as being something serious.If you are still concerned see your doctor.but I realy think you are OK.By answering you I have taken your past posts into account and thats important, because it shows that like most of us here,you suffer from health anxiety.For evidence of this read my most recent post.Best regards,Dimi.",

            "answer": "thanks i appreciate it. yeah im seeing my doctor this week for a follow up for the anxiety issue but ill bring this up just to see what she thinks as well.\u00a0\u00a0I'd say i eat a lot of fiber, way more than normal.\u00a0\u00a0In my food, I would say I have 6 slices of wheat bread throughout the day and i have a bowl of oatmeal every morning, which is all high in fiber im sure, correct?\u00a0\u00a0As far as when you say it can also be about how much exercise I do, could a lot or not enough exercise cause this? I exercise 5 times a week which I know is a good amount so if that could possibly cause this stool then the high fiber diet and frequent exercise may have caused this.",

            "answer": "I don't think your stools are a problem, the problem is usually when they are black which could indicate internal problems, and yes medicine can change colors.But is sounds like part of your anxiety is constant worry about medical problems. Are you seeing a therapist who can help you with the\" awfulizing\" you are doing. I can relate. A good\u00a0\u00a0cognative therapist can help with the stuff, to help you put things in perspective",

    "question": "This time, something strange is going on.. for the past few weeks, my stool has been a light brown, kinda pale in color.\u00a0\u00a0I go number two about twice a day which seems a bit odd.\u00a0\u00a0Could my anxiety meds cause this? I noticed the strange stool color around the time i started taking the meds, i take sertraline by the way.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be a real health related issue with my liver?\u00a0\u00a0It's wierd because i dont have any other symptoms except for stomach aches maybe once or twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0If you have read my past posts on here, you might remember the diseases i thought ive had such as HIV, lung cancer, brain tumor, diabetes, etc, so try not to take any of the past into account.",
