            "answer": "Hello.If it is only the left foot that is problematic, you should consider some lower spine problem. A pinched nerve in the lower back can lead to weakness of the muscle that elevate the foot while walking.Do you have any other symptoms ? Was there any back injury ?Are you a diabetic ? Does your left foot have sensations ?Regards",

            "answer": "Thanks for the quick reply. I do have pain in the back, generally from the lower thoracic to the lumbar areas. I am able to walk on my toes and heels equally, but this exacerbates the pain in the back. My reflexes are normal including at the knee and ankle. Babinski reflex is normal. Occassionally, there will be a brief numb-like sensation in the left foot, but when I touch the foot I can feel the touch of a feather, pin, etc. Sometime, the sole of the left foot gets tingly. During my physical in the summer my fasting glucose was 104 mg/dL and AIC at 6%, which they said was okay, so I don't think I have diabetes. I do not recall a specific back injury. My coordination and motor skills seem fine. Interestingly, the arch on the left foot has somewhat collapsed over the past few months. Does this help any?",

            "answer": "Hello.Well, it seems you do not have symptoms due to a possible diabetic neuropathy. But there is certainly a neuropathy, which has caused to loss of arch.Can you get Electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction study (NCS) done ? These two will be helpful in finding out if you have some nerve problem.Regards",

            "answer": "Well, I had the EMG/NCV today, which was normal. According to what I've read, some of the possibilites are stroke, diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, parkinson's, ms, and hyperpronation. I have had recent blood tests for diabetes and stroke. If someone has a stroke, it's hard to miss right. I mean, I would know it, right. Any advice?",

A stroke will usually have other more distinct features associated.Since the EMG has come back normal, a peripheral nerve disorder also does not seem to be the cause. Can you ask for a muscle biopsy ?Regards",

            "answer": "Chances are you have what is commonly called \"drop foor\" and the cause is nerve compression secondary to disc deterioration in the lumbar region. You have textbook symptoms. I see no point in a muscle biopsy at this point, unless you are a masochist and enjoy pain and discomfor to pay for sins in a previous life. . What you need is an MRI , prefarably with dye contrast (not a CAT scan) and not an x-ray of the lumbar vertabrae. Often a protcedure called a laminectomy is considered. You need to get this done because if it goes on too long the condition may be permanant.",

            "answer": "As I reported, my EMG/NCV is normal. A lumbar MRI has now been found to be normal. I just learned that some people have had sciatic nerve injury including drop foot after\u00a0\u00a0receiving gluteal intramuscular injection. Well, I had a few injections (RIG) in my hips/back of my hips in August 2005. Could my symptoms be a sciatic nerve injury despite the normal test results? Note that my EMG/NCV is normal and I can walk on my toes and heels all around and across the room, but my left foot arch has somewhat collapsed so that it hyperpronates when walking. If so, is there anything that can be done now? Some people have a procedure to try to free the nerve, but usually this is done right away. I'm not sure if the sciatic nerve was injured, or maybe could scar tissue have formed in the gluteal area that is pressing on the nerve?",

            "answer": "Hello.The possibility of a sciatic nerve injury looks distant as the nerve conduction is normal. It would have shown up in the NCS.Do you have the foot drop only on walking? The lumbar MRI is also normal. This helps us to rule out cord compression and sciatic or any other nerve injury.Do you have toe foot drop only on walking? Does it come while you are sitting or lying down?Regards",

While walking, it seems like the push off phase on my left foot is not as strong, which may be causing the occassional drag and limp. While seated, I can move my foot against resistance (doctor's hand) in all directions with good strength, so the weak link may be the dorsiflexors, from what I have read tonight about feet. I just tried an arch support shoe insert, which seems to give support when standing, but doesn't really help the walking.\u00a0\u00a0What do you think? Thank you once again.",

The ankle is lifted up, and the foot is lightly pressed from the soles. It is usually a sign of upper motor neuron loss.The lumbar spine MIR does appear to be the culprit.Regards",

It is getting worse. Just today at the mall, the front of my left shoe kept catching on the ground. I have to make a conscious effort to avoid tripping. Once again, I appreciate all of your help.",
