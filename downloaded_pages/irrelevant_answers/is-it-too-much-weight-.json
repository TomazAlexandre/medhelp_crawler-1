            "answer": "I'm in the same boat. On my 24th week check up some how I gained 10lbs in that month. I just weighed myself for the first time (at hone) since the visit and I have stayed the same. So far on here (my weight tracker) I have gained 24lbs since the beginning of my pregnancy. My dr. didn't want me to gain no more than 15-20lbs during the pregnancy. Anyhow I can't say if its to much but I'm in the same boat as you. I just hope my GD test comes out okay when I take it next Monday.Just remember to eat veggies and fruits. I'm finding hard to do so because they get quite boring...and drink lots of water and if that gives you heart burn go for non-fat (skim) milk.",

I'm on the thinner side so I', allowed to gain up until 19 kgs, I gained 15-16 kg during my first pregnancy and lost it all after 9 months. With this pregnancy, I am turned off more foods so that might explain why I have gained less weight (plus running around after a toddler and having alot of stress!).",

I know that starting overweight, high blood pressure, and heat diabetes are all reasons to try to not gain as much. But otherwise my midwife just says to eat as healthy as I can ans take my supplements (I,m anemic so that's especially important for me)",
