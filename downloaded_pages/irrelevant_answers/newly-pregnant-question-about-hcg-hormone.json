            "answer": "Im still trying to wrap my head around it. All my dr's said IVF was the only way it could happen. I didnt have that kind of money so we tried iui with Clomid with one dr, then when that didn't work and that Dr refused to try less expensive approaches we moved to a new Dr. He was willing to try Femara and ovidrel since I don't ovulate on my own. First cycle resulted in two cysts which I had surgery to remove at the end of January. While in surgery, the dr found stage one endometriosis which he removed. Aftrr healing,\u00a0\u00a0we jumped into round two of Femara 150 mg, ovidrel and timed intercourse plus preseed to help out and it worked!!",

    "question": "After 8 yrs of trying and a diagnosis of PCOS and diminished ovarian reserve I finally got pregnant. Two positive urine tests and two positive blood tests confirmed. Hcg was 20 on Saturday\u00a0\u00a0and only 32 on Monday. Saturday started bleeding but hcg levels are increasing. I have one more blood test tomorrow to see if the numbers are increasing like they should. Has anyone had low numbers and had a normal pregnancy??? The first positive urine test was literally an hour before the blood test was done also.Any info will help. Hoping for a miracle finally.",
