            "answer": "Have you gotten a gastric emptying exam? You might want to ask for one of these to be done, since it sounds like gastroparesis could be a very real possibility, especially considering your barium swallow test results. (Also, GP tends to affect women more than men, often after child-birth. The mistake some doctors make is to assume that it's only a side-effect of diabetes, yet at least 30% of cases are idiopathic.) Has your doctor mentioned Reglan or Domperidone as possible medications?Good luck.",

            "answer": "The problem here is that the hiatal hernia would show up in both the barium swallow and the endoscopy. The only indication is the noted stomach motility issue with the barium swallow. (The ulcers would also indicate that there's some type of acid stagnancy issue in the absence of H. Pylori.)",
