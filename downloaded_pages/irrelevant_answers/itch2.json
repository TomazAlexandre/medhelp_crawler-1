    "question": "well this terrible itching all over my body continues. had two lots of antihistamines and cream which eases it slightly but not curing it . my body is a mass of scars and two weeks ago I had a weeks course of antibiotics because I had a red swollen leg caused by the scratching. My partner says my back has a yellow tinge to it. Now I have little water blisters appearing on my legs. can anybody through light on what could by wrong. I am type2 diabetic [and have been for 15years] with reasonable levels and the doctor is satisfied with that. I also take a tablet for recent albuminium in urine but the itching started before I started on them. I also have been having lucentis injections in the eye recently.",
