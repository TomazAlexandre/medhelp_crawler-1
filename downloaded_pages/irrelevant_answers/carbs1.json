            "answer": "Sounds like you may be eating low carb and high protein, which is a mistake and can cause a surge of blood sugar via a process called gluconeogenesis.. This is a process of your body creating sugar from the protein you ingest.\u00a0\u00a0It happens when you eat very high protein with little fat and low carb.\u00a0\u00a0Try to not go over 1 gram protein per pound of lean body mass.\u00a0\u00a0For example, a person who weighs 150 lbs should limit to 150 grams protein per day.\u00a0\u00a0Also do not shy away from healthy fats, like olive oil, avocado, grass fed butter, nuts, full fat yogurt, etc.\u00a0\u00a0many people make the mistake of removing fats from their low carb diet, which then causes gluconeogenesis. The trick is eating low carb with moderate protein and balance of calories from healthy fats.",
