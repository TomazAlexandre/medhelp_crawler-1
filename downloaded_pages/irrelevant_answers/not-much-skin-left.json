            "answer": "\"Cannot get glucose to level out either.\"What are you doing to control your levels? Following and eating a diabetic diet, performing daily 30-60 min exercise, and maintaining normal body weight? Medication alone will not control your glucose levels, doing all the aforementioned helps greatly.Also, since you are HCV positive when was the last time you had a liver biopsy and an liver panel [LFT's] tests? You want to verify the health of your liver and ensure it is not depositing bile salts under the skin which can cause one to scratch an itch to no end. Good luck",

            "answer": "Like WaveRider says get your LFT's and a biopsy done.If you can, get referred to a hepatologist (liver specialist) or have your Dr's treat you for ALL your ills. You may want to look into treating it as they are now getting cure rates approaching 90%!!!I have HCV (Hepatitis C Virus)\u00a0\u00a0and diabetes caused by the HCV but don't have the itching (yet). The medical term is pruritus if you want to research more. Here is a link to a great HCV sitehttp://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/factsheets_pdf/pruritus.pdfThe best thing I ever did for myself is working out. I used to feel like I was dying and didn't want to do anything. Now I work out most days and slowly worked myself up to a pretty tough workout. Slowly is the key word here otherwise you get too sore and never want to start again :o)One last piece of advice: be kind to your liver - NO alcohol if you can and get help with it if you need. I sure did and yesterday was 16 years since I last tasted alcohol and it is the only reason I am here to write this todayGood Luck and Happy Thanksgiving,Chris",

            "answer": "The Dr. does not know why I cannot get my glucose levels under control. I do not partake of overly large amounts of sugars or carbs. I exercise daily for 30 min. to 1 hour, mostly housework and walking. Strenuous workouts are out of the question. I do not drink alcohol and since I have cirrhosis from the HCV I have a GI Dr. following the liver. I have been told that the bile ducts are functioning normally as well. LFT's are normal. I am asking them, the VA, for a liver biopsy but so far they have not scheduled it. Thanks for writing, I appreciate the response.",

            "answer": "\"The Dr. does not know why I cannot get my glucose levels under control. I do not partake of overly large amounts of sugars or carbs.\"One shouldn't consume any sugars, refined or in foods. Read ingredient labels carefully. Sugars listed under carbohydrate are in grams, where every 7 grams equals one heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar. Pay attention to hidden sugars; corn syrup, cane syrup, dextrose, and so on. Then, limit your carb intake. Carbs will elevate your glucose levels like sugar.\"I have been told that the bile ducts are functioning normally as well.\"A GI doctor is not a liver specialist, an Hepatologist is. You have a legal right to have copies of all your lab work by request. Check your Alkaline Phosphatase test result. If the level increases it usually indicates bile duct issues.If the VA does not have a Radiologist on staff to perform the biopsy or a Pathologist to analyze the biopsy tissue sample you will get a run around. If so, push to see if they have a \"sister\" program with a local hospital that has those two doctors. A biopsy is the only way you're going to know your livers Stage and Grade.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the information. I'll repost when I can get the biopsy results back and keep an eye on the sugars. There is also the evil Sugar Alcohol which these companies use which really gets me going so I watch for that as well. Going to start a low carb diet next week and see what happens. I guess it is all up to the individual since the Drs. are not there beyond giving advice. Thanks again.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Type II diabetes in 2006 but most likely dates back to 1998 when Hep-C was discovered. Recently I have been on 30 units of Lantus and a sliding scale for the Humalog. The issue at hand is the intense itching which has been getting increasingly worse over the past year. At first I could not determine where it might be related to as I also had to have my thyroid removed due to cancer (yeah, I'm pretty messed up). Since the Drs. are more concerned about everything else I have been doing my own trials and discovered that if my glucose is high or too low the itching becomes unbearable from head to toe. Anyone out there hear of anything like this? Cannot sleep, concentrate or even go out in public itching like this. Thank you for taking the time to read this.P.S. - Cannot get glucose to level out either.",
