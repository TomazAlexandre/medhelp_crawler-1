            "answer": "First of all, relax, stop with being anxious and scared, continue with being proactive\u00a0\u00a0and the diagnosis will be known soon.Thank you for providing additional information. The reason I asked is the possibility of a diffused hypermelanosis (including yours) to be hereditary or aquired; to be liked with pathology of one or more endocrine glands or caused by use of certain oral medications; related to prior inflammatory process and/or friction; etc.\u00a0\u00a0Acantosis nigricans is a possible diagnosis too (paraneopalstic form has to be excluded).Diagnostically, it is recommended to investigate endocrinopathies (such as\u00a0\u00a0hyperandrogenism, insulin resistance & hyperinsulinemia, hyperthyroidism, adrenal pathology, etc.) and to evaluate the\u00a0\u00a0state of mucous membranes and mucocutaneous borders.\u00a0\u00a0You could have those results even prior to your visit to a dermatologist who will then be able to correlate those data with clinical findings and establish final diagnosis.Wishing You Optimal Health,Dr. Jasmina Jankicevic",

    "question": "Hello Doctor,I am a 27 year old lean asian indian woman. Over the past year I started to notice darkened skin along my neck which seems to be growing. Similarly, I also noticed pigmentation under my breasts and inside my inner left thigh. However, these pigmentations are more spotty, thicker, raised and much darker than the ones around my neck. The ones around my neck looks more like patches of dark brown than spots and are not very raised. None of these pigmentations itch much, only occasionally. I had my physician run blood tests for me to see if it could be diabetes but every thing was clear including glucose levels. She did not however do a specific insulin resistance test since she said that the imbalance would have showed up in the normal blood tests and that I was too thin\u00a0\u00a0to have diabetes. She also said that the cortisol level was normal so she ruled out addisons. Now I am very worried. I am not even sure if this is infact acanthosis nigricans since it does not cover the back of my neck or underarms and its much more spotty. Could this be anything else? Can I send some pictures so you could get a better idea? (I will add the spots on my thigh to my profile).I have not been able to get an appointment with the dermatologist till Jan next year. I cannot wait that long since I am very anxious and fearing the worst. Any help will be appreciated.",
