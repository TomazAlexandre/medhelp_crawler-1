    "question": "I'm not looking for a diagnosis, I'm going through testing to figure out what's going on, but wanted to see if any of this sounds familiar to anyone.Back in 2004 at age 37, I woke up with horrible left flank pain; frequent urination 40-60 times daily 8-10 times nightly; extreme fatigue \u201cflu \u2013 like feeling\u201d; peripheral edema; my dr did tests...everything from urinalysis, cultures to IVP; to US; nothing was found except severe endometriosis & adenomyosis both female related. This just hit me out of the blue and I had never had any type of pain and no kidney stones were found.Since then, my urinalysis and cultures have shown things like WBC Leukocyetes 1-2++, Urobilogen (0.2), Trace Ketones, until a couple of months ago.I complained I was still having symptoms and very frequent urination after all these years so my primary started running tests. My tests showed Epithelial cells 10-20, WBC 2++ (20-40); Tr Ketones and Bacteria \u2013 Moderate but there was no infection in the cultures they ran.I then had to do another test which showed my protein was 30 mg/dl so she sent me for a 24 hr urinalysis, which I'm doing today as well as a host of other tests.Starting this test, I knew I urinated more than the normal 1500-1600 mL per 24 hours, but I was shocked to find in less than 5 hours time I was over 1100 ML.I've had just about every blood test there is possible and everything is fine except my A1c is .2 higher than it should be. I just had 14 vials drawn Monday from my Rheumatologist to find out if I have anything Auto Immune going on but haven't heard back, so that's probably all clear also.Since 2002, my Creatinine has been 1.0 -1.2 and my BUN 13-20\u00a0\u00a0NKF says my efgr would be 69; one test will be higher then next test lower.Any ideas what could cause this if I've had all these tests done and my kidneys work fine?add'l info - BP used to be 90/60 or less until a few months ago when it went to 189/140 for no reason; it has stayed between 130/90 - 189/140 since and no diabetes but my father did have diabetes and Lymphoma.",
