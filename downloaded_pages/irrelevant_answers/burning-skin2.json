            "answer": "Hi Justduff,I am so sorry to hear about your unusual situation. It must be horribly uncomfortable. I assume you have no skin rash or discolorations.The fact that your physician is using Gabapentin leads me to believe that he/she is also thinking this is a neurological condition. Nerve pain can be very difficult to treat successfully. I don't have Fibro - I have nerve damage due to injuries.We all react differently to different medications.\" Average\" doses of Gabapentin did nothing for my pain. It's normal to increase the dose until you do have some SX (symptom) relief. Unfortunately the side effects increase significantly as you increase the dose.Lyrica is a very similar - and often more effective medication. It works best for me. That doesn't mean that Gabapentin won't work for you. I just offer this information for your consideration.I assume they have not found a reason for your burning skin sensation. Have you sought second and third opinions? Have you seen both dermatologists and neurologist? If not I would consult both specialty - and again several until I found a reason. Not knowing what is the cause of our pain can be more than frustrating.I have heard of internal Shingles. Sometimes shingles can invade the nerves inside the body and cause other symptoms. Has that been considered?I'm far from a specialist in this area - or any area. Please take all of our information and suggestions as just that, suggestions. Even though some of us have a medical background there are no physicians in this forum.I hope something we have said has been of help. Please let us know how you are doing. I'll look forward to hearing more from you. If you have additional questions please feel free to ask. Good luck my friend in pain.Take Care,~Tuck",

    "question": "I have had burning skin, in several places, all over my body. It feels like I've been badly burned. it gets worse as the day progresses. I have tried topical treatments, but the pain is on the inside, therefore topicals have no effect.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to specialists, had several blood tests, now my doctor is starting to experiment on me with the popular drugs for fibromyalgia. Gabbapentin, Lyrica, etc. I am taking Horizant (which is Gabbapentin), and I am going to give it a few weeks to see if it helps. At this point, I would do anything to get relief. Does anyone know of other treatments for my affliction?",
