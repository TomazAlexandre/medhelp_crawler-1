            "answer": "Hello,from your results, you may be having early thyroid problem.\u00a0\u00a0The T4 is low.Ideally your doctor would conduct antibody testing.\u00a0\u00a0You should have your thyroid monitored regularly now (I would recommend every 6 months), and testing should include TSH, FT3, FT4.Your HBa1c is on the high side (though not enough to get you diagnosed as diabetic) - if you compare it to truely normal a1c, which should be in the low to mid 4s.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor were proactive he would order a glucose tolerance test.\u00a0\u00a0This may develop into overt diabetes with time.Are you overweight / normal weight?\u00a0\u00a0Are you phsyically active?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any family history of diabetes (type 1 or type 2). Was this feeling of being unwell triggered by any event?\u00a0\u00a0An illness?\u00a0\u00a0Vaccinations? Period of particular stress?For the meantime, please focus on eating a lower carb diet (no softdrinks, fruit juices, limit rice, bread, pasta, etc), and exercising regularly.\u00a0\u00a0I would be treating myself as if I had diabetes already (in terms of diet and exercise with this A1c).I do beleive this is something that should be watched closely.Hope you feel better soon.",
