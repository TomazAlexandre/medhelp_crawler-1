I was prescribed to do OGTT that's with 10 hours of fasting and they will draw blood from me and they will make me drink 75 ml of glucose fluid and then draw blood from me in two hours and again they will draw blood after 1 hour. Is that what you did? If not then what did you do? I think it will be helpful if you could tell me I'm so stressed coz I'm amemic and really worried about drawing excess blood as I get my blood count and thyroxin tested regularly\u00a0\u00a0:/",
