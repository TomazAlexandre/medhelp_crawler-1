Rather than provide hearsay, I urge you to go to the official\u00a0\u00a0United States Government FDA website, which has a comprehensive list of side effects. There are known instances of increased heart rate, so your information is incorrect., Some people are more likely to experience changes from this medication. There is evidence that in some cases ther heartrsate may be increased so you have to compare and contrast the heartrate before and after the medication. Increased heartrate means increased blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Like everything else, medications involve a risk-benefit evaluation..",
