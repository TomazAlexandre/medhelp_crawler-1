    "question": "Hey there. I'm pretty new to med help website. Thought I would try and post on here to see if anyone had any suggestions or ideas.I'm a 23 year old female. Still pretty young. I started having stomach issues when i was 18. i got an endoscopy done, and they found irritation in lining of stomach and esophogus. I got put on Nexium, which didn't help much. I got heavy fullness after eating like 2 bites, and horrible Nauesa.Just within the last year. I've started getting stomach problems again, only this time the nauesa was from eating\u00a0\u00a0everything from crackers, to anything...I noticed over past year i've lost a lot of weight, while maintaing a healthy/full meal intake.\u00a0\u00a0Im 5\" usually weighing in around 100-105 everytime the doc has taken my weight. Now im down to 86-87 pounds :(.. Keep in mind im naturally little, (korean), but still 86 is way to low for what my normal weight is kept around.\u00a0\u00a0As well this time around I've had blood in my stools off and on for the past year.I went to the gastro doctor last week, and she did a \"behind\" exam.. and found no hemroids, or fissures... So far I've gotten a blood test for celiac disease, i got a gastric empty study done last week, and am scheduled for a colonoscopy january 4th, which i've never had one before either..a lil bit nervous.My main concerns is the weight loss,\u00a0\u00a0and blood in stool... its a brighter red. Blood is on toilet paper and in stool. As well the nauesa... it interfers with life sometimes. Last week I had this episode that lasted 45 minutes. Out of nowhere i started getting dizzy, and my body started getting cold, like the feeling of an IV running through your arm... and was heavily nauseas.Anyone have any ideas or have been going through the same symptoms i have??? It seems most times i go to the doc its hard for them to diagnos... but im hoping and crossing fingers they have answers for me.Thanks again!!Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays",
