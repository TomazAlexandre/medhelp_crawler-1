            "answer": "Hi! I know what you are going thru! Your father probably as a condition called hepatic encephalopathy which is a consequence of his cirrhosis. Have you seen the ammonia levels on his last analysis? it's probably real high! You have to restrain the proteins in his diet! does he eat meat? if he does so, he has to stop it. Replace it for fish and be sure that the lactulose is working, I mean be sure that he goes to the bathroom at least once every day.",

            "answer": "His ammonia levels are normal and he does have more than 3 bowel movements a day. He also has Diabetes so having too many Carbs is not good for him. We tell him to slow down on the proteins, but he refusses to listen to us. I feel bad because I really want to help him and I feel like he is acting mean because of the disease, but when someone does't want your help what do you do?Thank you for the adviseCarrie29",

    "question": "My father has stage 4 cirrhosis of the liver due to Hepatitis C and drug and alcohol abuse. My mother and I are trying to care for him, but his mental condition seems to be deteriating exponentially. He is on Lactulose and a drug called Xifaxan to help with the mental issues. He wont go to bed and stays up 18 hours a day. He can't concentrate on any one activity to completion. He gets so distracted that he can remember to go to the bathroom and has an accident. He wont take his meds when we ask him to. He is verbally abusive (which is unlike his usual docile personality). He wont give up his keys to his car, and I'm scared he will get into an accident. And yesterday I found him in the bathroom putting deoderant on his ears. I don't know what to do for him to make him better or what care I could get for him. I feel like we are caring for a seven year old with adult rights. I have looked over the internet and found no information on people with this desease having this bad of mental problems. I was wondering if anyone out there is experiencing the same problems. Please help, I feel lost, alone, and on the verge of a breakdown.Carrie29",
