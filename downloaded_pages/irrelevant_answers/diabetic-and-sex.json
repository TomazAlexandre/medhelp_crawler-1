            "answer": "Hi im jackie and its nice to meet you and i have been dealing with diabetes since i was 13 and it could be the soap but the major cause of this is the diabetes and i get yeast infections constanctly its because of the sugars in your urine when you use the bathroom come out and the tiny sugar molecules get on your skin on your vaginal area that is what causes the itch and what i use in the shower down there in warm water and baby wash for that area because it very sensitive and your vaginal area gets dry this is due to the diabetes and you should always use lube and it helps a lot and its not painful but when you have irritation down there never has sex during that time let that area heal for about a week and i use monistat for seven days and drink lots of water and some cranberry juice and if doesn't help go see your doctor.",

            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor treated you with fungal cream and it worked, that is likely the cause.\u00a0\u00a0:>)\u00a0\u00a0What can happen with a man and wife is that actually, he can retain the yeast or infection (if this was a bacterial infection which green discharge and bad smell indicate mixed with a yeast or fungal infection which is a common combination) and pass it back to the woman.\u00a0\u00a0I would think it is more that than anything to do with the diabetes.I'd personally go back to your doctor and explain this.\u00a0\u00a0There is a pill you can take for yeast that he may also prescribe for your husband at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0So, then both of you are treated for it.\u00a0\u00a0But you'll need a doctor to tell you if this is going on.\u00a0\u00a0best of luck to you.",

    "question": "My partner is a diabetic, think type 2 but might be type 1. He loses wheight heavily due to the diabetic and we are still learning about it all as he was reacently diagnosed. I have always used dove soap but chainged to LUX for 2 months. We have moved from a dry hot area to a humid extremele hot area. Two months before the move I started with an itchy irreation in my genetailia area. The irreations would be les during my period but start up again after sex with my partner. I changed back to dove thinking it might be the soap. It became worse and a green discharge with strong fish smell started to come out.\u00a0\u00a0Sex became painfull and I am dry during sex.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor advised me to stay on dove soap and gave me a vagina invection cream which stopped it.\u00a0\u00a0But after syptoms is clear and there is no irritation it would reappear after a few sex sessions with my partner.\u00a0\u00a0I have never before had any invection or problem with smelly or coloured discharge.\u00a0\u00a0I am 35, about 55 kilograms and never had any children. My partners penis will also become irretated, slightly sensative and itchy. Is it possible that the discharge from my partner, being a diabetic, might be the cause to the invection? Or could it be a number of other aspects? Any advise on how to prevent it?",
