            "answer": "Hi there,Your asking if your blood test results could indicate MS, and the answer would be no, because there hasn't been any blood test connections found, well apart from Vit D but that's basically been connected to everything and the kitchen sink and it's meaning is very very unclear eg Australian statistics are 1 in 3 of the population have low vit D, that's millions but our MS stats are only 10's of thousands approx 0.01% of the population, so how strong a connection could it really be?These results from my understanding, could potentially be indicating that your dealing with the MS mimics though, possibly Lupus if positive ANA, TSH but if you look up each of your low results, various issues are mentioned eg liver, kidney, heart, pituitary, thyroid, pancreatic, vit deficientcy's, diet, diabetes etc.These results are definitely indicating there's a problem, further testing may be necessary before you get the right answers, your doctor will now have a better idea of what's going on with you, so hang in there!Cheers.........JJ",
