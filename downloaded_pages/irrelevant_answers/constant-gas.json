            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are some bacteria in the gut that produce hydrogen sulfide gas. This gas has a smell of rotten eggs. Most of this gas comes from sulfites a person consumes, which is a part of all preservatives. Sulfites are present in all juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough.If you have been taking these things in a good amount, then cut down the intake. Also take a lactobacillus preparation and yoghurt with your meals (you are already doing this). In all probability the smell will go. If it persists, then talk to your doctor. Get your self tested for hypothyroidism and diabetes as this slows down the gut. Food allergies too could be a cause.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,I am 25 years old but have chronic gas problem. It occurs when i have to sit for long time say about an hour or so as a result, I have to got toilet again an again just to relieve myself. Doesn't occur to much when i am at my home (because I normally don't sit too long in the house). Pudin hara capsules or pro-biotic drinks do tend to provide temporary relief but its gone when I eat something over them.Another observation is that I am unaware of the foul smell but others seem to get that. Is my nose now used to all these smell or what?Please help as this is ruining my social life.",
