            "answer": "hi it sounds to me like you may be suffering with depressin again alot of my family members suffer depression and so have i. The good thing is you have spotted it early and the best thiNg for you to do is get more exercise, meet up with that friend you haven't seen for agees and have a good giggle! being around ppl you care about and who care about you is always a good remedy! but dont feel like you need them that makes ya worse lol! depression suffering is alot about self help but thats my view personally others may have diffrent views, think to your self that today is a new day and smile wen you wake up and if thers things in your life that dont make you happy change them, life is far tooo short to worry about things alot of things are out f our control actually id say most! you need to come round to a more posotive way of thinking my favourite saying is it will come out in the wash lol my circumstances were diffrent to yours but your symptoms sound exactly the same hope this helps and if all else fails just see your g.p they can be very ubderstanding you know x advicewanted",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, it could be depression. However to nail this diagnosis certain other conditions causing similar symptoms have to be ruled out first. Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems.If you are also over weight, check out for diabetes and hypothyroidism. Another possibility is sleep disturbances. You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "For the past couple of months I have been feeling tired. At first it was like just not having enough sleep or exercising too much, now it almost physical every morning; it take a great effort just to get up and my eyes feel very heavy. I am now not sleeping properly, waking every few hours, not eating properly (loss of appetite one day to eating almost all day the next), crying for no reson and just out of the blue and what feels like slight heart palpitations. I did have a medical scare early on in the year, where my doctors think a virus attacked my bllod, causing neutropenia for a few months.I have had a severe illness in the past and last time I felt like this they diagnosed me with depression. My family has a history of it as well. I am just wondering could it be this again? Seeing as my body was thrown chemically out of whack?",
