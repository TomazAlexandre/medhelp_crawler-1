            "answer": "I had numbness from vitamin B12 deficiency. This deficiency is easy to misdiagnose as doctors don't routinely test for it and labs are too low in most countries which miss a deficiency state. I would recommend sublingual (under the tongue) B12 to see if you improve. Not treating B12 deficiency can result in permanent nerve damage.",

            "answer": "Yes, you can get numbness and tingling from Vitamin B complex deficiency.I was treated with that, it didn't work, so they put me on antidepressants for 6 months, that didn't work.\u00a0\u00a0I had a kidney stone that was pressing on nerves causing pins and needles and numbness in my feet.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. said it wasn't their fault the misdiagnosed me because I did not have the typical text book symptoms of having a kidney stone.Not treating B12 deficiency can also make the memory worse.\u00a0\u00a0It has been recorded that older people with dementia and alzheimers are lacking in the vitamin.\u00a0\u00a0A deficiency in B12 has other symptoms too even causing MS (I have a book on this).I have read that a good indictor of lack of B12 is having no moons on your fingernails, the thumb being the last moon to disappar.I did take the sublinguals for quite a while and did feel better all round, but the moons that had disappeared on some of my fingers never did return.Some countries have a high threshhold for lack of B12.\u00a0\u00a0In the UK the level of B12 is much lower for example than in Japan.I would recommend taking them, but a doctor can\u00a0\u00a0take a blood test for this.",
