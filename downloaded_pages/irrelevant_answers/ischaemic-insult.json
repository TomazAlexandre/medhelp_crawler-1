These changes are mainly seen in diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines.Regarding the sinuses you have chronic sinusitis affecting mainly the maxillary sinuses behind your cheek bones. Please consult your doctors regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
