            "answer": "Hi,This is a condition called balanitis.Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis. Lack of aeration and irritation because of smegma and discharge surrounding the glans penis causes inflammation and edema.More common in uncircumcised males.It is usually caused by poor hygiene in uncircumcised men. The inflammation can be due to infection, harsh soaps, or failure to properly rinse soap off while bathing.One common organism associated with balanitis is a yeast known as Candida albicans.\u00a0\u00a0Balanitis may occur because of excessive growth of Candida, due to moisture and warmth under the foreskin.It can be treated by applying Miconazole, an anti-fungal medication.Most cases of balanitis can be controlled with medicated creams and good hygiene.Inflammation has many possible causes, including irritation by environmental substances, physical trauma, and infection by a wide variety of pathogens, including bacteria, virus, or fungus\u2014each of which require a particular treatment.Retract the foreskin daily and soak in warm water to clean penis and foreskin. Apply bacitracin (not Neosporin) for pediatric patients if bacterial infection is suspected.Apply topical clotrimazole for adult men with probable candidal balanitis.If the symptoms persist, you would need to consult your doctor.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

    "question": "I have type 2 diabetes which is controlled with medication. my problem is, i have developed a rash under my foreskin that has persisted for more than 4 months. it causes the foreskin to shrink around the head of my penis and a rash appears under the foreskin and on the head of the penis. it itches terribly and when i pull the skin back to clean;\u00a0\u00a0the foreskin splits to the point of bleeding. my physician prescribed Diflucan( which worked years ago) but no longer has any effect. i have tried monistat 1 thinking it might be a yeast infection, but has little effect! likewise, i have tried a triple antibiotic and no effect. i have heard that the diabetes may be the cause of the infection. i don't want to go through circumsion, but it seems like my only option. any ideas of what this might be?",
