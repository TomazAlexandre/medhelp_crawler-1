            "answer": "Im sorry. I had a regular appt on May 14th and I thought it was going to end up badly too, and guess what, it did. I was admitted for possible preeclampsia that day and they discovered I do have it after the results came back from a 24 hour protein check. I have been in the hospital since that day, and wont be going home until I have my baby at 37 weeks. They are planning to induce on June 18th (at 37 weeks) and my original due date is July 9th. By then I will have been stuck here a whopping 36 days plus the recovery time after i deliver. Hopefully your due date is before mine that way if they keep you until you deliver it wont be as long. Its torture being here all day and night, and its especially bad when ALL of the doctors in the WHOLE PRACTICE have learned your name and room number from seeing you so much. Plus they have me on complete bed rest with \"bathroom privileges only.\" Who knew going to the bathroom was a privilege! Good luck and try to take care of yourself in the mean time bc hospitals are no fun, especially when there is no going home anytime in your near future.",
