I don't know about you, but for regular check ups they just get my weight, blood pressure, fetal hr and ask me if I am fine... and I am. So far I've gained 15 pounds (I will be 26 weeks tomorrow) and they would like me to gain more weight. The baby moves, but it is gently movements, I've not experienced the real painful kicks yet. :) what about you?",
