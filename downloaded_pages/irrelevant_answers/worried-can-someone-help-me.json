            "answer": "the reason why Casey22 mentioned those questions is that she is concerned with you having Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). patients with PCOS usually have less periods, tend to be overweight, and have heavy body hair. PCOS umbrellas a large spectrum of problems related to irregular periods. so some people may not have obvious physical symptoms but still suffer from it. a simple blood test can reveal your hormone levels. essentially, your body doesn't build up enough progesterone to ovulate and thus form a normal period.while PCOS is common and can easily be a fist suspect, many other problems can occur. it's hard to tell what's wrong with you from your description. information including your age, health condition (i.e. sexual activeness, STD history, diabetes, mental health ect.) can also help a lot. certainly, you don't have to reveal these details here but they do matter when you see a doctor. if you are still a teen or in your early 20s, you can have irregular periods and it is normal. as other kind people have said here, it can result from other problems.my recommendation is, of course, to see professionals soon. meanwhile, no matter what you do, DO NOT PANIC. it doesn't sound like a pregnancy to me personally. even if you had a tubal pregnancy, you should not have had your period. a few tips can help in the LONG RUN:1) chart your basic body temperature every morning. this measure can help you monitor your ovulation. if you ovulate, you will have a period. if not, go to see a doctor right away.2) record exact dates of your periods: beginning and end. if you spot, record it. if you have abnormal discharge (amount, color, texture, odor ect.), record them as well. it's like writing a journal of yourself. soon you'll see if there is a pattern of irregularity or this is only a one-time encounter.3) it's standard to go through blood tests. doctors may also recommend a brain MRI to decide if you have a benign tumor behind nose to imbalance hormone levels (this kind of tumor cannot become malignant). ultra sounds may also be done. a vaginal ultra sound test can decide if you have PCOS because it can help see the structure of your ovaries. in short, be informed and prepared.4) do not be surprised that doctors find nothing. i know some women never have 12 periods per year. it's just the way they are.many women take it for granted to have a 28-day cycle. in fact, the cycle can be easily disturbed by so many things. as i said, do not panic. find a trustworthy doctor whom you can trust. bring your journal and questions to him/her. take care and good luck :-)",
