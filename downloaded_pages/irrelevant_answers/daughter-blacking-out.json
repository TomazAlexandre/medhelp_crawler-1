    "question": "My daughter is 13 and we have been trying to find out for 3 years why she keeps having blackouts. We have had blood tests, EKG's, stress tests, you name it. We can't get an answer that helps. We have heard increase her salt intake, increase her fluid intake, increase her protein. The offical was syncope, but its getting so bad that shes falling to her knees. Shes perfect height 5.7\u00a0\u00a0120 pds. We have an appt with a neuro but 60 plus days out. She also has horrible sleep, always waking up, constant disturbed sleep. We have set for a sleep study also 30 days out. What possible could this be? We just keep getting pushed from one doc to another. I'm terrified she is going to collaspe and hurt herself. Any recommendations appreciated.",
