            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Since your NCV and EMG tests have not been normal there is a strong possibility that you are suffering from peripheral neuropathy. This can occur due to diabetes or B12 deficiency. Have these tests been done in your case?Viral illness can result in chronic fatigue syndrome which is characterized by generalized aches and pains and myopathy.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chronic_fatigue_syndromeTake care!",

            "answer": "I have been diagnosed with both peripheral neuropathy & myopathy by my neurologist.I am not sure if I have been tested for diabetes (I have had several blood test....Would that show in a CBC?)I was tested for vitamin deficiency and my counts are all normal.\u00a0\u00a0(Vitamin B & D)Since I was diagnosed with gastroparesis in March and the neuropathy in June, my doctors have idicated to me that they are related to one another and could have been caused by each other.\u00a0\u00a0I am looking for a connection between the two.I appreciate the effort to throw in names like \"Chronic Fatigue\", however, I feel my problems are much deeper than this \"symptom diagnosis\".\u00a0\u00a0No doubt I am weak and tired, but I can't help but think that is from what is actually going on in my body and not a syndrome.Any help you have with true diagnosis that are related to my stomch & nerve symptoms would be extremly helpful.Thank you for your quick response.",

    "question": "I am a 28yr old female currently suffering from Gastroparesis, Peripheral Neuropathy, Myopathy.My Gastroparesis was diagnosed in March 2008 with symptoms beginning in Jan. 08Peripheral Neuropathy & Myopathy were diagnosed in Sept. 2008. with symptoms beginning in June 2008.Symptoms started as numbness in fingers and toes, but has now progressed to aches and pains all over my arms and legs.\u00a0\u00a0The pain varies from stabbing, cramping, muscle pain, joint pain, numbness, etc.I have even experienced episodes to which I thought something was scratching my leg, only to lift up my pant leg and realize nothing is there.I am currently under the care of a Neurologist, Cardiologit, GI specialist, and primary doctor.\u00a0\u00a0They have all aknowleged my symptoms and have come up with the diagnosis I have so far (listed above), but seem clueless as to what to do next.I have under gone a battery of test ranging from MRI's, CT, Tilt Table test, Camera Endoscopy, and countless amounts of bloodwork - all to which have came back ok.Part of my problem is that my doctors have never told me what they were actually testing for with each test, only that the results were negative, so I have no idea what has been \"ruled out\" at this point (other than the research I have done on my own with some of the results I have in hand)The only test thus far that have shown anything are the NCV/EMG performed by the Neuro doc - and the Gastic Emptying exam.I do have swollen lymph nodes that have been labled as \"reactive\" - biopsied twice.I am not on any medications to help with the pain and symptoms of the neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I am hoping that is coming with my next doctor visit, but I do hesitate to just start taking pain pills and prefer to have an alternative.My questions is\u00a0\u00a0- Does anyone else suffer from these same symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Has your doctors had any luck with a diagnosis?\u00a0\u00a0Suggestions?It has been suggested to me that a virus could cause these symptoms, however, I do not recall being sick prior to the onset of this illness.\u00a0\u00a0Any idea as to what types of viruses could cause such symptoms?(I did have viral meningitis in 2003, but can't find any research to support that it would cause any long term effects)Thanks -",
