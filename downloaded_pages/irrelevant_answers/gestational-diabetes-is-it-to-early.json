            "answer": "Diabetes runs in my family as well and I've had problems with blood sugar randomly through out my life, I had symptoms of passing out, I'd eat and become exhausted and feel like I hadn't slept in days. That's how I actually found out I pregnant. I passed my glucose test on the first try, it was actually on the low end of average. The passing out lasted all through my pregnancy, it did get quite a bit better after I found out I had low iron and started taking iron supplements daily. Sorry it's so long :)",
