            "answer": "While I personally can neither speak for or against the use of online pharmacies, the reality is that they are becoming very popular among U.S. buyers becuase of the money that can be saved. Here is a web site that discusses some of the pros and cons of using online pharmacies:http://www.expertlaw.com/library/pubarticles/online_pharmacy.htmlNow, that being said, I can point you perhaps to some help. Please take the time to go to the website of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and send an e-mail requesting assistance in this area. The JDRF staff has experts who have all sorts of information for folks like you to help with either insurance possibilities or aid with the expense of the medications. After you send your e-mail, you will be contacted by one of the staff who specializes in this area. It is better to discuss this type of thing one-on-one rather than on a public forum such as this, for some questions may have to be asked concerning personal income, eligability for state-sponsored aid, etc.If any others out there DO successfully save money by using online pharmacies, we would love to hear feedback.",

            "answer": "Before posting the first answer, I sent an e-mail to the JDRF staffer who usually answers questions about financial help in treating diabetes. I received the following answer, which includes some good suggestions:\"I would recommend that he contact his doctor and see if the doctor is familiar with an online pharmacy and could recommend one. (Your doctor may also have medication samples to offer you, which can ease the expense of purchasing supplies a tiny bit.) There are pharmaceutical assistance programs offered directly by some drug companies for people with diabetes who have little or no insurance to help offset the cost of supplies or prescription medications.\u00a0\u00a0The Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association has information on such programs; you can view this info at:http://www.phrma.orgor call 1-800-762-4636\"",
