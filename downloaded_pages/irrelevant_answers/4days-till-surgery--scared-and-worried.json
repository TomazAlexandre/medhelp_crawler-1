            "answer": "My mom had one lobe removed 13 years ago. She's 75 now and has more energy than me! I flew down from college to stay with her after surgery. Within a week she was back to her usual self, cooking and cleaning for everyone.Yes, she does take Synthroid every morning on a full glass of water. Nothing else to drink or eat for an hour. I do it, too. It's a lifestyle change, but you will get used to it. Most doctors prescribe Synthroid, a synthetic T4 drug, but know that you have options. Sometimes, you might still feel tired and you will need to get your FT3 levels checked. If they are on the low side of normal, then you could benefit from adding a T3 drug to the mix like Cytomel. Some people don't do well on the synthetic Synthroid and Cytomel and they need the natural drugs like Nature Thyroid.Just remember that you have options. A GOOD endo who specializes in thyroid, NOT DIABETES, will treat your FT3/FT4 levels, not just TSH. Your endo should be open-minded to trying natural drugs if the synthetics have side-effects.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "You will do great.You may or may not need medication, not everyone who has half their thyroid removed does. My sister did not need any, still does not after 30+ yrs.I had a TT done so I need it. I did not have any issues related to surgery when I got it done. I stayed longer than usual but for other reasons, not surgery per say related. I don't even recall being sore after two days. No problems with voice either.I did not have any issues with the scar, you don't even know it is there.I do agree with TamraW, get an Endo who specializes in thyroid, NOT diabetes. I personally have my PCP handle my lab work and dosage, and I only go see an Endo when I feel that I need to.Good luck, you will do just fine.",

            "answer": "Hi .Hope all goes well for you on thursday,im sure it will.Ive just had a right lobectomy done 10 weeks ago, and it went well, it was my second thyroid surgery, and after two weeks off rest i felt fine. I put bio-oil on the scar and its very faint now, have some nice ice lollies,or ice pops for the first few days, they help with the throat,I have to take thyroxine, because i had a sub-total 11years ago for graves.and now i had a nodule over my trachea on the bit of right thyroid tissue that was left.I only spent one night in hospital,woke up with no drain, and no stitches, i had my scar stitched inside then glued, it was a tremendous job, compared to my first surgery.Just take things easy, and dont go lifting anything heavy.Im wishing you well for thursday, and who knows, you might be one off the lucky ones who dont need thyroxine, as some people dont need meds after a lobectomy, fingers crossed.",
