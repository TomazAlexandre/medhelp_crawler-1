Its so hard to be bigger when your pregnant. Last week I had an appointment and the stupid nurse practioner spent the whole visit telling me that I'm GOING to to have gestational diabetes because I'm fat so I should only drink water and have only lean meats and veggies... no starches or carbs at all. It broke my heart because I eat really well and actually lost 60 lbs between my pregnancies and she made me feel like all that work meant ****!!! I feel your pain. Good luck and I hope he comes soon and naturally for you :-)",

    "question": "My doctor says Im 4 days behind where I am so she doesnt share my concern. 4 days is small I know so it's not a huge deal ..She said I it feels like the cervix \"may have softened and thinned out\" may have?! May have!!?????! Is it or is it not?! I am racing the clock here because my hospital doesnt induce after youve had a c section. My boy already measures in the 90th percentile at over 8lbs. (My last was 9lb 5oz). I measure 41 weeks today! The longer I wait,the bigger this baby gets and the likelyhood of my vbac goes down!I am stressing hardcore.Also,later today I have an anethesia consult for if I end up needing a c section (1 csection,1 vbac...this is the tie breaker). Apparently I am so fat that I need to go in and talk to these people about the trouble with fatness and anethesia!I am 5ft 8 and heavily pregnant 260lbs. I was 220-230 before getting pregnant, I honestly cant remember. I am a little pissed off about being told Im \"class 2 obese\" when I dont even wear plus size! Im a tall,busty,solid woman! Ughhh! Yes I could stand to lose a few lbs but sheeeesh!Anyone else needed to do this?Sorry, It feels like I have no patience for anything right now! More rant than question lol",
