    "question": "My scan is clean.\u00a0\u00a0There is no recurrence and no sign of anything to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0: )\u00a0\u00a0Yay.For those of you who do not know me...I found out in Feb 09 that I had thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0two weeks later I had my thyroid out in my first ever surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Why start out small after all.\u00a0\u00a0I had found the folks here at med help and OMG...they got me thru the worse time.\u00a0\u00a0I rec'd encouragement and learned things.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I felt like I was learning more than what my drs knew at the time.\u00a0\u00a0It took three drs to even get the correct diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0But long story...well....long... I just had the nastiest year of my life and didn't even realize until summer this year, that I actually missed out on a lot of life during those months.\u00a0\u00a0I was tired and pretty much just took every day one day at a time and just continued to put one foot in front of the other.\u00a0\u00a0I did start to feel some better along about Oct.\u00a0\u00a0My meds were right at that time and in Nov I actually lost 8 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0(only 100 left to go) Then everything just sort of stopped again.\u00a0\u00a0I felt better but wasn't really putting much effort forth.About a month ago, I was diagnosed very early with diabetes. JEEEZ what's next right?\u00a0\u00a0I am attempting to control it with my diet. Lower carbs than I ate before and I have lost 30 lbs. I FEEL GREAT.There is life after thyroidectomy.\u00a0\u00a0It took me a year and a half.\u00a0\u00a0I will have another scan probably in another year and I will be edgy and gritchy for the week that I have to wait for the results.\u00a0\u00a0But today is a good day.Thanks again to all my friends.\u00a0\u00a0For now, I am clear.\u00a0\u00a0I was going to say normal, but well, that just means so many things that I will never be.\u00a0\u00a0LOL\u00a0\u00a0Have a great night everyone.",
