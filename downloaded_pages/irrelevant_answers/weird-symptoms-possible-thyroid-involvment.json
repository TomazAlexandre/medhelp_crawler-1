            "answer": "Thyroid symptoms are so nonspecific and share many symptoms with other health issues.With your thrist have you been checked for diabetis?Your thyroid levels are on the low hypo side probably in Labs reference range. However it is suggested to have thyroid/levels checked yearly, and with yours being on the hypo side I'd have them done, if not again.ANA ab: Postive 2X's ANTI rnp positive,\u00a0\u00a0is generally used to test for autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus, commonly known as SLE or lupus. A positive test is suggestive of the disease.I am not a doctor and what little knoweledge I do have is with thyroid issues due to being thyroid myself.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry I can't answer to your other Labs.Before thyroid diseases were discovered, people with thyroid issues were put in the loony bin.Good Luck!",

            "answer": "First of all, ANA positive with speckled pattern pretty much means an autoimmune desease.\u00a0\u00a0Speckled pattern is very non-specific, meaning it does not point to a specific disease, but there is definately something going on.\u00a0\u00a0I am one of those people and am just starting to go through all the testing, that will point to possibly which disease it is.\u00a0\u00a0Autoimmune diseases are not easy to pinpoint.\u00a0\u00a0As for your thrist, diabetes come to mind before anything else, but that is pretty easy to rule in or out.\u00a0\u00a0My dad is an insulin dependent diabetic and before he was diagnosed, he could not quench his thirst no matter what, and lost all kinds of weight, among other things, but they ruled it diabetes as soon as they checked his blood, as his level was over 400.\u00a0\u00a0Graves disease (thyroid) can also cause excessive sweating, and that in turn, could cause the thirst.\u00a0\u00a0My puzzle pieces are slowly starting to come together.\u00a0\u00a0Since my dad is diabetic and that is an autoimmune disease, I am not starting to figure out that this genetic flaw of mine is most likely coming from my dad, even though I do not have diabetes at this time.\u00a0\u00a0I am just hoping that all my symptoms aren't pointing to my eventually getting it.\u00a0\u00a0It is starting to look likely to me though.\u00a0\u00a0Hope I have helped you!!!",

    "question": "Hi there,I'm wondering if I may have a thyroid issue or somethingelse weird.\u00a0\u00a0I am turning to the internet because I reallydon't know what else to do.\u00a0\u00a0I have lab results from about 2 years ago on the thyroid and some other stuff. I have waited to go back to the DR because last time I was there I was basically told that I had mental issues.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, I was very upset.So, anyway, here are the \"weird symtpoms\".\u00a0\u00a0 Bad Migraines, menorrhagia-I literally hemmoraged a week ago and wound up @ the ER, SEVERE, constant fatigue, tachycardia-am on cardiazem for it, periods of bracycardia, weight gain (I was super thin all my life untill 3 years ago, rare spells of complete weakness (My BP goes sky high, my HR goes high, and I shake badly.) I am thirsty all of the time-I probably drink over 2 gallons of water a day!, I have a major \"excessive saliva issue\", anxiety-am on zoloft & small amounts of clonazepam to control it.Here are the blood tests-they are old-but the only thing I have got.-TSH: 1.24 mcu/ml-FT4: 0.8 ng/ml-M-MONO for the past 4 & 1/2 Yrs has come up positive. 12.2-12.6 (tested 3X's)-ANTI rnp has tested positive 2X's in 3 yrs. Level @ 2.04,2nd level can't figure out.-ANA ab: Postive 2X's. I can't figure what the levels R onthis one.\u00a0\u00a0The lab report says it's \"speckled\".Can anyone tell me what might be going on?\u00a0\u00a0I am really tired of feeling crappy all of the time.\u00a0\u00a0If this is in my head & I'm just nuts-how do I get rid off feeling like this?Thank you & God Bless!",
