            "answer": "If you have gestational diabetes that means you ate will probably be sent to a specialist to talk to a dietitian so they can get you sugar levels in control. There is not necessarily anything wrong with your baby, but if you don't control it it can possibly cause the baby to have issues and can cause them to get bigger than necessary. It really isn't a huge deal, a lot of women get it. Just listen to your doctor and everything should be fine. There is a possibility that yiu will have to deliver early if your sugar levels cannot be controlled.",
