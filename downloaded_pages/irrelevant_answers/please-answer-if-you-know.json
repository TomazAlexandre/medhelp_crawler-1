With that said, don't let that dissuade you from losing weight, keeping on top of your blood sugar all the time, and exercising as much as possible; because whilst there may be some damage done from prior poor control, you still have the power to stop further damage.",

            "answer": "Hello,Metformin can deplete B vitamins.\u00a0\u00a0B vitamins are essential to nerve health.\u00a0\u00a0So if you are taking metformin, then you should consider supplementing with B Vitamins.However, there is a confounding factor in that many people who are taking metformin are still walking around with very\u00a0\u00a0high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Very high blood sugars cause serious damage to nerves.\u00a0\u00a0So what do you blame?\u00a0\u00a0The metformin, or the high blood sugars?Neuropathy is reversible with normalization of blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Normal blood sugars should be in the range of 70-120 for the vast majority of the time.If you cannot achieve normal blood sugars with diet (low carb, moderate protein, high healthy fats), and exercise, and oral meds, then one should drop the oral meds and use insulin to achieve excellent control.Recovery from neuropathy even with normal blood sugars takes a long time.\u00a0\u00a0Nerves grow very slowly.\u00a0\u00a0Recovery time is 6 - 18 months of consistent excellent control.\u00a0\u00a0Also during the recovery period the pain may initially get worse (due to the pain of the regrowing nerves).\u00a0\u00a0I have read some accounts of people who did recover from neuropathy and they all said they noticed a really difference at 6 - 9 months.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "super sally ive been reading through the post and I see you believe. why do you say this \"Neuropathy is reversible with normalization of blood sugars\". I want to believe believe also but everything I read says once it starts there is no reversing could you explain why you think this is true so I can have a better understanding.I bought r-lipotic acid which made my vision blurry and supplements called tangy tangerine after the supplement I think my nerves got worse first time I felt pain as before that they were only hypersensitive and omega 3 do you think there is something else I should be doing or could be doing?",

            "answer": "You can get the book Diabetes Solutions by Dr. Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0He has personally reversed diabetic neuropathy and also helped in many of his patients.\u00a0\u00a0Not just neuropathy, many other complications of diabetes (though not all) can be reversed by normalizing blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Normal is 70 - 120 range.I am also on a patient to patient forum called **********.\u00a0\u00a0They also have many people who managed to reverse neuropathy by truly normalizing blood sugars.You have nothing to lose, if it works (except your neuropathy and risks of other complications). It will take effort though.\u00a0\u00a0You will have to learn more about managing diabetes and how to control your blood sugars and then you will need to be consistent.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I'm wondering if I lose weight and get my diabetes under control with this stop the neuropathy in my feet and legs I can also feel it in my hands?\u00a0\u00a0its mild now but I don't want it getting better I hear stories all the time about people losing there life and legs to this disease.I have been looking over the internet and today got a lot of organic veggies in R-lipoic Acid that I see is given in Europe but not in usa I guess because they cant patent vitamins here. I will start working out tomorrow as my muscle tone has decreased especially in my legs. I want to try and to do the most I can, not to just avoid the pain but to regenerate the bad nerves if possible.I had bells palsy once and those nerves that had once paralyzed my face got corrected I'm hoping this will also do the trick especially if I lose weight now at 367. what do you think about this",
