            "answer": "Hello.You have to see how these symptoms are affecting your day to day work. B12 deficiency is a good option to rule out. But the twitching could be a part of the Benign Fasciculation Syndrome. It is know to increase with anxiety and stress.Also, you need to rule out diabetes as a cause of a possible peripheral neuropathy. Diabetic neuropathy typically starts with fingertips and toes.Multiple sclerosis is a very distant possibility. But again MS can have all known symptoms. Your worry about MS will itself increase the twitching in the muscles.You should get yourself assessed by a Neurologist and get any further tests if necessary.Keep me posted.Regards",

    "question": "Hi, doc.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 29 and recently started having weird symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0They are mostly in my hands (very tips) and feet.\u00a0\u00a0It's tingling and occasional stabbing sensation, and at times itching sensation. It also feels like there \"ants crawling under my skin\".\u00a0\u00a0 It seems to be under the skin and I don't have any sensory changes.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms happen when I'm still or at night when I'm in bed.\u00a0\u00a0Actually, they mostly happen at night.\u00a0\u00a0They are getting worse as I can't sleep at night because of these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The nighttime is just like nightmare to me.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I noticed I started having muscle twitches/fasciculations at night, mostly in my calves and thighs.\u00a0\u00a0I don't seem to have any weakness, though.\u00a0\u00a0What can this be?\u00a0\u00a0I'm so concerned.\u00a0\u00a0I've researched B12 deficiency, MS, peripheral nerve hyper excitability. Can you please give me a piece of advice?",
