            "answer": "I've had three inductions. None of mine took as long as yours. Was you already dilated when they started or did they use a cervix softener to prepare you for the induction?\u00a0\u00a0My first one I was already dilated 2 cm but my other two they had me come in the night before and put in this thing that is on a tampon like string and it has a medicine to soften the cervix then the next morning they take it out and start the pitocen. If your cervix doesn't fully soften it can cause the labor to be much harder and increases your bleeding risk. Talk to your doctor and discuss your concerns about your last induction and see if there is anything more they can do to prevent it from happening again.",

            "answer": "My first induction was horrible too. Second pregnancy, I had to be induced. New doctor, new hospital..\u00a0\u00a0I told them my horror story and they made it a point to make me comfortable. My second induction was a million times better. Now I'm on my third pregnancy and most likely will be induced again. I really hope it goes smoothly again. Talk to your doctor so she can work out a better induction this time.",

            "answer": "I am pregnant w #5 now. I have been induced each time w the pitocin drip, and each time have had a shorter and eaaier labor/delivery.\u00a0\u00a0I typically dialate to 2-3cm then stay there until induced. My Dr has said this will most likely be an induction as well\u00a0\u00a0given my history. The epidural makes the induction go a lot faster and smoother I.have found. Best wishes!",
