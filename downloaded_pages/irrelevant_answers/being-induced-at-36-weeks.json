But as long as she is an optimal weight and is able to breathe and function on her own, I don't think they'll put her in the NICU. They may have her there if they feel it's best,\u00a0\u00a0but there's no reason to fret over something. I'd be too excited to worry about it. My due date is December 19th. Good luck.",

My first was born at 35wks due to the same thing and only required 1wk nicu for breathing, feeding and jaundice, but it really depends on the baby. We are delivering at a particular hospital because we are expecting to need some nicu. Good luck!",
