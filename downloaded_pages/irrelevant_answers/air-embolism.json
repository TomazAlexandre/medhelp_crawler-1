Go back to the top of this page and click on Forums, scroll down to \"Ask a Doctor\", Cardiovascular Disease forum and post there. Call the hospital and get the name & phone number of the attending surgeon. Call his/her office first thing in the morning. I'm sure they will be glad to answer all your questions and concerns as he/she is the best and only person to discuss your mother's health with.",

    "question": "Hi, I am not sure where I should post this question but it's somehow related to diabetes.My 65 year old mother was injecting insulin when she had forgotten to fill the syringe with the drug and had accidently injected about 18 units (1/2cc syringe) of air into her tummy. Will this amount cause air embolism?I have already called a doctor and he asked me not to worry but I am still worried and hope to seek second opinions here.Thanks in advance!",
