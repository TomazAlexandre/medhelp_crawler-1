            "answer": "I think I read somewhere that the contrast agents are iodine rich and can cause temporary hyperthyroid symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0These will go away when the excess iodine is out of your system.So adding more iodine would make your symptoms worse.",

            "answer": "I have read that now, and I felt terrible for the two days after the iodine supplement, so I stopped it. The hyper symptoms and the goiter didn't show up until maybe 6 mons. after the CT scan. The nerve pain in my feet started the day after, and is still going on. I found this today.\"Lymphocytic thyroiditis - This condition most likely is autoimmune in nature. Patients develop an autoimmune goiter and permanent hypothyroidism more often than they do with the painful form of subacute thyroiditis.\u2022\tCertain drug exposures relating to excess iodine and cytokines may cause this form of silent thyroiditis.Pain in lymphocytic thyroiditis - The thyroid pain can be extreme. Nonsteroidal medications are administered. Avoid high-dose aspirin because, in some circumstances, aspirin can competitively displace thyroid hormone from its binding protein and increase the free, or bioactive, fraction of thyroid hormone, which can make patients feel more thyrotoxic. In extreme cases, stronger pain medications, including narcotic analgesics, are indicated for a brief period of 2-3 weeks. In the most extreme cases, high-dose steroids (eg, prednisone 40-60 mg qd) must be administered. The high-dose steroids rapidly and dramatically decrease the pain and thyroid swelling, but the natural course of thyrotoxicosis and pain (ie, 4-6 wk) is not altered, and the glucocorticoid treatment must be continued for this period.Peripheral manifestations of thyrotoxicosis - Patients often find great relief from tachycardia, palpitations, anxiety, and tremor with beta-blocker therapy. Propranolol is generally recommended because of its CNS effects. The patient usually titrates the dose depending on the symptoms. Exercise caution with the initial dose; patients may become hypotensive, because they are often dehydrated from the decrease in oral intake of fluids and increased perspiration from thyrotoxicosisAvoiding high-dose iodine supplements, such as those found in seaweed tablets, during and after an episode of subacute thyroiditis is important. Inflammation appears to prevent the thyroid from escaping the iodine-induced Wolff-Chaikoff suppression of thyroid hormone synthesis. These patients are likely to become hypothyroid when ingesting large amounts of iodineNo limitation in activity is necessary, but patients may experience tachycardia with exercise. Good hydration and beta-blocker therapy should allow patients with subacute thyroiditis \u2013 caused thyrotoxicosis to exercise normally.Medical treatment for subacute thyroiditis is supportive in general. Thyrotoxicosis can be extreme but temporary (eg, 6-8 wk). The subsequent hypothyroid phase is usually mild and lasts 2-4 months. Therapy is directed toward reducing the signs and symptoms of the hyperthyroidism with beta blockers or iodine agents. Pain is treated with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents (NSAIDs). Rarely, high-dose steroids and narcotic analgesic agents are used for extremely painful or recurrent life-threatening hyperthyroidism.Anti-inflammatory agents are administered to patients with painful subacute thyroiditis. Patients should avoid high-dose aspirin because it can increase free thyroid hormone levels by displacing thyroid hormone from its protein binding sites. Narcotic analgesics can be administered if the pain is extreme and prevents oral hydration. Rarely, high-dose steroids (eg, prednisone 40-60 mg PO qd for 4-6 wk) may be used to decrease the pain, if necessary.Ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) DOC for patients with mild to moderate pain. Inhibits inflammatory reactions and pain by decreasing prostaglandin synthesis.\"http://books.google.com/books?id=AZUUGrp6yUgC&pg=RA1-PA303&lpg=RA1-PA303&dq=thyrotoxicosis+caused+by+radioactive&source=bl&ots=K2x6voKV6b&sig=EW2PEIL-5I-CisH961JPUqWwca8&hl=en&ei=v5iGSs2kEs37tge7jtnnDA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=5#v=onepage&q=&f=true",

    "question": "Hello everyone --my T4 was 1.09,\u00a0\u00a0(0.8-2.2)my TSH 0.535, (0.46-4.70)I don't have my T3, (forgot to keep a copy) but it was 2. something w/in normal range,had a ultra sound needle aspirated biopsy of fluid cystic and solid nodules, no cancer cells in the nodules.The goiter from the multiple nodules is effecting my swallow. I choke at night if I sleep on my back.I went to an environmental Dr. because I think my trouble is cause by a reaction to CT scan contrast Isoview.He put me on Ioderol-- iodine/iodide 12.5mg and for 2 days I thought I was going to die. Symptoms are low grade fever 100.3, chills then sweats, aching all over, pounding heart, headache, the shakes (these come and go)\u00a0\u00a0increased frequency of bowels, excessive thirst puffiness under my eyes and swollen knuckles.I have started a new career and am having trouble getting through the day. I have an appointment at Duke Sept 2. with an endocrinologist, but that is 3 weeks away.Do I have sub-acute thyroditis, and what do you do for it?Thank you for all your support and feed back.Thank you, thank you, thank you",
