    "question": "find it hard to get and keep and erection. Its a lot of work to get it up and once its up i have to keep stimulating it if i stop for a few seconds it starts to go soft again. This started when i was 18. I couldnt get it up when trying to have sex with a couple of girls and i havent had sex since because of this. the same thing happens with masturbation. I have to do it for at least 30 mins othewrwise i dont ejaculate anything or just a tiny drop. Also lately when i ejaculate the semen just flows out like water. Its thin and watery as well not thick like normal.I used to get strong ejaculations where it shoots out up to my stomach or chest but now most of the time it just flows out. Its really upseting me. Also as soon as i ejaculate i go soft. Just a couple of seconds after. I dont drink or smoke or use drugs. Also i am not overweight. I know this is not normal for someone my age. Thanks for any help.",
