            "answer": "You should be concerned now. Please see your doctor, preferably an Endocrinologist, a doctor specializing in diabetes, asap.Your morning fasting [89 mg/dl] is within normal ranges of 60/70 to 99 mg/dl, yet your postprandial [2-3 hrs after meal] is often considered diabetic normal. Some doctors say this is normal while others contend that a normal person would return to normal fasting levels. Testing your glucose should be handled as such:OGTT [Oral Glucose Tolerance Test] - You will be given a sugary substance then tested at different intervals to see how well your body handles the excess sugar.A1c test - will provide a mean glucose measurement. The test result is in % [percentile]. The optimum max range is 5% [99 mg/dl] even though some set high a value of 7% [154 mg/dl], which to me contradicts normal fasting ranges of 60/70-99 mg/dl.Also test for Thyroid dysfunction. A TSH [Thyroid Stimulating Hormone] test will check the release of T3 and T4 hormones by your pituitary gland. A malfunctioning thyroid will disrupt insulin production causing your glucose levels to be erratic.Then you mention \"I have very high \"highs\" and very low \"lows\" complete with blurred vision, shaking, anxiety, and constant urination.\" but failed to tell us when these very highs and very lows occurred. Tell the endo when these occur as it will help determine your treatment. Also, these extreme swings are dangerous to your overall health and should be addressed properly. Good luck",

    "question": "Is blood glucose reading of 139 ok two hours after eating? I've just begun self-testing and I've had three readings of 88 (afternoon, no food), 89 (morning before eating or drinking), and 139 (two hours after eating). My mother's family has Type I diabetes (8 out of 11 total) and my father developed Type II before he died. I'm concerned because I have very high \"highs\" and very low \"lows\" complete with blurred vision, shaking, anxiety, and constant urination. These symptoms seem to have crept up on me quite quickly - I've always had to consume a lot of sugar to keep myself going, but suddenly it seems that no amount is enough. I force myself to eat even when I'm not hungry just to keep the symptoms at bay. And I've lost weight recently although I've eaten much more sugar and carbs than in the past.How long should I continue to self-monitor at home before taking the information to my doctor? I can't really afford to be diagnosed with anything serious right now so I'm trying to control things at home, but the extremes are almost too much to bear!How often do you test, and at what point should I be truly concerned?Thanks for your information.",
