            "answer": "You've heard the song,\"The knee bone's connected to the thigh bone...?\" it sounds like this may be what's going on...If the foundation of a house isn't sturdy, the rest of the house will show strain in it's structure...The same with the human body...if you have unsupported arches, your ankle, knees, hips, and low back will try to compensate...As the strain worsens, they will start complaining...and in your low back, nerves will began to get pinched as the disks compress from excess weight hanging off the front of your body...(For every 5 lbs of excess weight we have on our belly, it puts 20 lbs of pressure on our low backs...), thus explaining scrotal pain too...So, things you can do...Wear supportive shoes, keep working on getting to an optimum weight, and just get up and move (even if it's slowly) for 30 min a day...Being diabetic, this is especially important...Don't be surprised if, when you are able to get to a healthier weight, your diabetes resolves itself...Good luck! May you feel better soon!",
