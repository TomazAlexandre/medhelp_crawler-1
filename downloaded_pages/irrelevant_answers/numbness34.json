            "answer": "DEAR ADELE -Thanks for your questions.\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to go back to your doctor and let him or her know that you are still not feeling well.\u00a0\u00a0At the very least a thorough physical exam as well as a few laboratory tests might identify a treatable condiiton\u00a0\u00a0- or, if normal, reassure you that your body is o.k.Numbness is a vague sympton - and without seeing you myself - I really cannot make a diagnosis. But, again\u00a0\u00a0- a thorough exam, some laboratory tests (including tests for iron, sugar), and even an Xray or CAT scan might be considered as part of your workup.\u00a0\u00a0Also - a careful diet history might be useful - i.e., are you eating healthy and on a regular basis?\u00a0\u00a0At the very least - treating an anemia, if still present, might make you feel better. But DO seek medical attention if the numbness persists.Your doctor might want you to see a Neurologist - to be thorough.Good luck - Dr. Vinton.",

    "question": "I'm an 18 year old college sophmore.\u00a0\u00a0I've been trying for days to post my question in the neurology section, however I have been unsuccessful.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry to bother you outside of your specialty. The problem is that both of my little toes have gone numb constantly for the last three days.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my health center and they knew about as much about this problem as I do...nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I am over-weight, 5'5\", white, female.\u00a0\u00a0I am really concerned about this problem.\u00a0\u00a0I have some other symptoms but I don't know if they are related or not.\u00a0\u00a0I am always thirsty, I'm anemic, and I get dizzy really easily.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for taking the time to read this and I appologize again for applying my question to the wrong doctors.\u00a0\u00a0If you can forward this to someone with more information, I would appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0Adelle",
