            "answer": "I have diabetic since a teen (luck of genetics because im not over weight and live activly) im 33weeks pregnant with my second. With pre existing diabetes I had no choice but to go on insulin when I found out I am pregnant. 5 shots a day and check blood sugar 8 times a day I feel like a pin cushion!\u00a0\u00a0I feel for you guys with gestational diabetes, I already knew what I was doing when I got pregnant this is all new to you guys. The only thing I can tell you is take it very seriously, fallow a strict diet and exercise regularly. Its very important diabetes can cause heart problems in your baby and also you want the diabetes to go away after pregnancy. Do what the doctor tells you. Get it under control now because once the third trimester starts its ten times harder to control. Educate yourself as much as possible.",
