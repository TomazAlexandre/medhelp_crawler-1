            "answer": "Hi there,Do you have any other symptoms besides the diabetes. I know many of us are on Metformin including myself because we have pcos which causes diabetes and insulin resistance so we take the Met to control the insulin resistance even without diabetes.Reason I am stating this is because pcos causes extreme hair loss.",

            "answer": "I have been on 1000 mg of metformin for about 1 year. Are you taking any other meds? I started taking Topamax 6 months ago and started noticing hair loss the past couple of months.I looked up side effects for all my meds and found Topamax lists hair loss as a side effect so I have stopped taking it. Hair loss can also be due to stress, I didn't notice any hair loss until I had been on the Topamax for a while so I'm almost certain it was the Topamax. Good luck to you.",

I&#39;ve been on 1000 mg/day since late February and my hair has been falling out like crazy! I&#39;m distraught about how thin it has gotten and stopped taking Metformin cold turkey as of this week.
