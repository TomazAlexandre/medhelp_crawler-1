    "question": "Ok so, two days ago I was sitting at my computer, I had a sudden mood change and started sweating, even though it was 75 in the house, I felt kind of hot and cold at the same time (cold sweats I assume). I felt very weak, shakey, and kind of out of it; The feeling you get when you have too much caffeine, minus my alertness. So I stopped and went to bathroom to take a shower and calm myself down because I felt very scared. I've had problems with anxiety and depression for the past 6 years but this goes beyond anxiety. I feel very spacey and lightheaded and i get weak like i'm going to pass out. I've had absolutely no appetite and when I do get one the second I see food or get any i feel like I wanna throw it back up. I don't though. I sometimes feel a little better when I do get food though.Also my stool has been very water and its not diahrrea, its just in small pieces and I get the urge to defecate more often now also.I've been going through alot of stress too lately. Its nothing new to me, i'm used to stress, trust me.I've also tried to stop drinking lately, I've been drinking every night for the past 4 months, probably an equivalent of 7 - 8 beers and liquor over a time span of about 6 - 8 hours of alcohol consumption per night.My mom has diabetes, so I'm not sure if that could be it too =/I do get anxious but I can keep under control, which is why i don't think these are panic attacks. I know what they feel like. I do get anxious but its more me being concerned about feeling the way I do. If anyone has any suggestions as to what this may be, I'd appreciate your input\u00a0\u00a0=)",
