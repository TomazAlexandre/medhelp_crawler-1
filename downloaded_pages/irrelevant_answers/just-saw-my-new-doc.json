            "answer": "Your requests are quite reasonable and rational.There may be a missing piece (meaning insurance coverage).If you like her, ask if insurance is the issue. I suspect that is so. Otherwise I would find another physician to be my primary care. You should have a full blood panel (including D3) at least once every other year.",

            "answer": "I went to a GP for panic disorder and the first thing they did was CBC and thyroid test to make sure that it wasn't my thyroid out of wack.Go to a different doctor or go to a clinic it is faster and they usually do whatever you want. It is a doctors job to be though and check everything. Maybe this doctor just assumes its the anxiety talking. I hate doctors like that they never help",

            "answer": "Hello,I would certainly see another doctor. You are paying her to help you, this is NOT right. Your requests for these tests is very sensible, I can't understand why she would not want to let you have them, after all, the money is\u00a0\u00a0not out of her pocket.",

    "question": "Hey guys. Ok maybe it's just me but tell me if I'm wrong. I went to see my new doctor today who took over my old one. Now she is very nice, very thorough, asks lots of questions etc.. she asked me my main symptoms. I told her all of them . We also talked about my anxiety and health anxiety. My main concern is checking to see that none of my physical complaints have a medical cause behind them. So I asked to please check for thyroid, b12, iron , diabetes, etc... she didn't want to hear it. All she said was she is checking a cbc. I dont need anything done. It's my anxiety. Well what if it isn't. What if diabetes is the cause, or thyroid.. Couldn't she get into trouble for saying no_! How do I get these things checked????",
