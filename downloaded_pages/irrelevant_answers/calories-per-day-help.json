            "answer": "Definitely not good for you, but the calorie intake is just a guideline. If you have a very active lifestyle and job then obviously you will need more. For example I walk between 1.5 and 3 miles, 6 days a week. Sometimes I walk more than that. So I should probably be eating a little more than I do. Regardless I am slowly gaining and baby is healthy. But please don't double your calorie intake. And don't forget about all the empty calories that are in chocolate, fizzy drinks, sweets and crisps. Try to fill up on carbs and protein.",
