            "answer": "We aren't doctors sadly.\u00a0\u00a0So us giving you advice on what other things it could be is going to be extremely limited.Lets talk about a few things.\u00a0\u00a0Your exposure was low risk (as you were told by Vance in STD's which I know he won't steer you wrong).\u00a0\u00a0The fact that it happened but the condom was replaced is a low risk.\u00a0\u00a0Even unprotected oral sex is considered low risk.5 week tests are soon for HSV testing.\u00a0\u00a0Between 2-4 weeks 50% will show positive.\u00a0\u00a0Something to remember is that it being negative means there is a odd in your favor of not having HSV.\u00a0\u00a0Typically those with a first HSV infection typically seroconvert (the process to which anitbodies are found/detected) is a little sooner then those with previous HSV infections.So lets do the word math if you will.Risks:\u00a0\u00a0Condom protected encounter: Low Risk for Herpes.Unprotected oral sex (for a few seconds): Low Risk for HerpesNo lesisions/Blisters: No direct sign of Herpes infection to which youa re looking out for.5 week negative test which can be a 50/50: Adds to the ensuring the low risk encounter.Several providers who have examined you and feel nothing is herpes related: Adds to making the low risk encounter and being HSV negative even stronger.Overall you don't have much to worry about and spending time on worry isn't going to help.\u00a0\u00a0If you have Herpes which I doubt you even have then I am sure your doctors would have thought your sores were more serious.\u00a0\u00a0They didn't.If I may share a personal story... I had unprotected oral sex (gave and recieived.) my encounter is a low risk encounter.\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after the encouter I got a fungal infection.\u00a0\u00a0Which led to two yeast pustules on the forskin.\u00a0\u00a0Talk about freak out mode.\u00a0\u00a0I had at least 3 provider tell me it wasn't herpes.\u00a0\u00a0I had a sore I showed to an NP and she though HSV.\u00a0\u00a0She ordered a HSV IgG test.\u00a0\u00a0It was 9 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Guess what the test came back as?\u00a0\u00a0Negative.\u00a0\u00a0I had another bump just this week show up.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my dermatologist who looked me over from head to toe (had some bumps in the sides of my lips I was curious about).\u00a0\u00a0Guess what he told me today.\u00a0\u00a0Besides that he saw my fungal infection clearing up the bump I had seen was NOT herpes.\u00a0\u00a0Didn't even make him THINK herpes.\u00a0\u00a0He got his little magnifing glass out to check and make sure.\u00a0\u00a0He looked me dead in the eye and said \"I am extremely sure you don't have herpes from what I see here.\"\u00a0\u00a0Again going to show that low risk doesn't always mean you will be infected.Time to move to a doctor and have them do further looking at to what this maybe.\u00a0\u00a0It could be a lot of things.\u00a0\u00a0That is why doctors have so many years of school and new things happen every day.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors are like computer techs.\u00a0\u00a0In computers things change daily.\u00a0\u00a0Medicine is the same way.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of different conditions out there and the doctors have to try to rule out as much as possible.\u00a0\u00a0If you are still worried about herpes get a 16 week test and once it is negative you can rule out herpes once and for all.",

            "answer": "I know right :(.I'm gonna keep on taking the Amoxillin 500 and see how that works out. The tired weak feeling in my legs have subsided somewhat since taking the Amoxil, but it seems as tho the electric/stinging sensations have increased :S..Throughout my entire body (Arms/Legs/Feet/Back). I will definitely be seeing a neurologist and having an MRI as i've been Google-ing and there seems to be alot of complications which can be causing these symptoms.( Prostate/Bladder infection, Diabetes, Back Injury (Sciatica), Anxiety (which I HIGHLY doubt), Neuralgia.But I definitely know for sure that it's nerve related and whats got me so hooked on the Herpes idea is that from reading other people's personal experiences, Herpes \"causes\" their Neurological disorders.Whats got me confused as well is that I've been exercising and I was getting confused with the pains from the exercises I performed.I used an AB Slide which if not used properly can cause injury, mostly to the back. But I used that after I experienced the pains in my legs so I couldn't put the 2 together.I did lots of push ups before I had any arm pains and after my chest became sore..the left side of my chest took long to heal than the other side and it was near the armpit which led me to believe I had a swollen lymph node.There was a bush fire almost next door to where I live, which flared up my sinuses. A few days after and thats when i really began feeling ill. (Thought i had contracted HIV)So yea my situation is a bit annoying as there are no physical symptoms and I cant get a proper diagnosis.",

            "answer": "Okay, So I came across Herpes Zoster, A Viral Infection which can cause itchy bumps on your skin...well maybe I have this?? When I first noticed my outbreak was happening..I noticed a few bumps on my Thigh which resembled mosquito bites.. I also had some one on my foot below my kneee and on close inspection it looked like a small cluster of bumps on one big bump....was red and very itchy..I resisted scratching it and put BNT ointment on it which took it away in a few days, but these itchy bumps kept recurring and in the same places...mostly on my left side, I even had some itching on my hands this one bump that itched like crazy and then scabbed over....some itching in my fingers as well...now all these itching phenomenas have resolved..and I have Neuralgia all over my body...Left arm, groin,back,neck. It wasnt this bad in the beginning and became worst over time...which I was wondering if it cud be PHN, Postherpetic neuralgia?I wasn't tested for Herpes Zoster, maybe I contracted it while at that strip club?I've never had Chicken Pox/Herpes Zoster happen before neither any vaccines against them",

            "answer": "I am curious to see what you come up with. I have had similar symptoms. Nothing I would call a classic outbreak meaning blisters then lessions. I have had what I describe as an icy/hot feeling (sunburn feeling) in my thighs, buttock and legs to my feet along with it in my left arm and shoulders. I also get a strange feeling in my face around my mouth and on my tongue. I have had pimples or spots on my thighs, buttocks and arms and even had something on my toe that one I think was a pimple aLso had some cuts on my tongue, and irritation around my lips.\u00a0\u00a0I have taken multiple test through 17 weeks post exposure and everything has come back negative for herpes and all other STD's. I know the HSV status of the person I was with and she was positive for HSV1 & 2. I just took another test here recently which will be 5 months post exposure waiting for the results.",

            "answer": "I've also been googling around and Ive come across lots of websites which claim that Natural Coconut Water or Coconut Oil Fights and (eliminate) various Viral Infections such as Herpes and HIV. There are alot more things like Influenza, SARS etc that it helps eliminate.It's good for UTI, kidney, prostate and bladder problems and helps fight off and flush these toxins out of your body.What they have been saying is that the Lauric Acid in coconut water destroys the protective layer of the HIV cells which can then be eliminated.I know that I haven't been tested positive for anything, I surely pray I don't either. But I'm gonna give this a shot because right now althogh I feel much better ( I Prayed ) :) The benefits seem great.I would have posted a link, but I'm currently typing this out on my mobile.But you can surely Google this up and see what you thnk.",

            "answer": "lol when your desperate your desperate.But I also made another discovery, which could be responsible for all the nerve pains virtually all over and may go to my doc today to get it checked out. For as long as I was a teen up until this moment I've had numbness in both my big toes, left and right, on the outer side and I've never payed much attention to it.As for my itching, I've always had problems where i would just itch. I dunno generally itchy :SOn further research I've come to realize that these are all symptoms of...Diabetes....or high Blood Glucose...now before the onset of all the nerve tingling, while I've been at work, I drank a lot of malts...which are high in glucose.All of these crazy symptoms that I have been experimenting are ALL symptoms of Diabetes/High Blood Glucose which can lead to Diabetic Neuropathies: The Nerve Damage of Diabetes.\"People with diabetes can, over time, develop nerve damage throughout the body. Some people with nerve damage have no symptoms. Others may have symptoms such as pain, tingling, or numbness\u2014loss of feeling\u2014in the hands, arms, feet, and legs. Nerve problems can occur in every organ system, including the digestive tract, heart, and sex organs.\"\"About 60 to 70 percent of people with diabetes have some form of neuropathy. People with diabetes can develop nerve problems at any time, Diabetic neuropathies also appear to be more common in people who have problems controlling their blood glucose, also called blood sugar, as well as those with high levels of blood fat and blood pressure and those who are overweight\"It can really drive you nuts and so far, it matches my symptoms to perfection.

    "question": "I've posted already but please can someone give me some more insight or probable causes of my problems?8th Feb 2010- I had protected intercourse and oral with girl of unknown status. It lasted about over 1hr.*condom broke during oral, when she was jerking me off, it was quickly replaced*9th Feb 2010- I masturbated and noticed a red spot on my glans below the ring or my penis, after when i took a shower. it was a bit sensitive but didn't hurt and went away in less than 1 week.28th Feb 2010- I noticed my penis started to tingle/burn a little after urinating, which was also accompanied by stinging sensations leg/groin area.4th Feb 2010- Went to the doctor and he diagnosed me and told me that it doesn't seem like herpes and that the burning sensation after urination could be a *non-specific bacterial infection* and put me on Ciprofloaxcin 500 and Ibuprofen until 10th March 2010 which is 1 week.The Cipro apparently took away the stinging sensation after urination but the stinging sensations in my legs/groin/lower back/buttocks persisted but not as much. My legs then started to feel weak especially when laying or sitting down and I started having nerve pains in both legs, almost like small electric shocks.15th March 2010- Went back to the doctor and he diagnosed me again and told me nothing is wrong with me and that this is all most likely Anxiety/Stress related and thats whats causing my pain. I convinced him to let me have some blood tests and he agreed and prescribed some medication to help me relax.All tests which included Chlamydia, Herpes IGG and HIV PHLEB RPR came back Negative and a week later he gave me the results and reassured me that I do not have herpes or any STD for that matter AGAIN.During this time I tried going about my normal everyday life, but these pains are still present and apparently getting worst.24th March 2010- I've been to my Family Doc for sinus problems and the same problem. She took a urine sample and sent it off to be checked at a Lab. She also prescribed Amoxil 500 and Alegra for my Sinus Infection because it was really bad and Cataflam for the pains I told her I was experiencing which doesn't seem to be helping. I think i also had a swollen lymph node under my left arm, but I couldn't really be sure because I had been exercising and my left side of my chest seemed to be injured and the pain went into my armpit as well. The other night I got really flustered cause I was urinating frequently (often at night) about this phenomena and I coughed and my chest started to hurt and become tight.I do not know whats the, I'm broke now after going to the doctor so regular and don't know where else to turn. My next step is to see a Neurologist and have an MRI and probably see a Urologist if symptoms persist.Could I believe my doctors advice that I don't have herpes?Are these any symptoms at all of Herpes whether it be HSV-1, HSV-2, Herpes Zoster. I've had an occasional bump show up on my thighs, legs and arms but they all itch like normal and go away and they are never in clusters or turn into blisters or anything.Are any of my tests that were done valid at 5 weeks post exposure?Can this all be due to Sciatic pains? and is this related to Herpes?Today I've been experiencing chills...all now as the wind blows through the window and I live in the tropics.",
