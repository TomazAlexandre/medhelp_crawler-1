            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes a 16 year old can have TIA. This DEFINITELY looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Again this can be due to low oxygen supply to brain where the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off generally due to a spasm of the arteries, or a clot or high blood pressure causing micro leaks in the brain.The symptoms include temporary loss of sensation in any part of the body, black outs, vision loss, tingling, loss of function of a limb etc. It is common in people with high blood pressure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and high cholesterol. Hence all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.Generally this can happen several times before an actual stroke happens. This is a warning sign for the body. If you have such episodes, then you must get them evaluated immediately.Please consult your PCP immediately for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "Maybe once a year I get these weird things. It begins when it feels like one of my arms does not belong to me. It feels longer and it's numb to tingeling. Next comes the inability to talk normally and unbalance. It also is very hard to write in my own handwritting. It's messy and weird. The only way I cab get it to stop is by taking a 2+ hour nap. Any idea what is causing it? They also seem to come out of nowhere at any time of the day.",
