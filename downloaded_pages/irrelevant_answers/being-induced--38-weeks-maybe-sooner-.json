I kept pushing my clinic and they just kept giving me run arounds. I did ask on here what can I do meanwhile to help myself and most mommies were very helpful with diet tips and all but at the end no matter what I got treatment too late. Thanks for the comment though.",

I go between 2-3 times a week for checks and the NST is a breeze they just put two straps on your tummy and listen to the heart beat for 20-30 minutes just to make sure all is okay. I wish you and baby the best!",

    "question": "So had my Dr appt today and wasn't very good. Didn't hear what I wanted to hear. My diabetes is out of control so much he will def induce me at 38 weeks if not before. I have to now go twice a week with my ob and with the specialist so I can get monitored and they can see if maybe I will need to be induced before. I also have to go to the hospital Wed for an nst and other tests he's asking for. Its a bitter sweet ordeal. On one hand I will have my baby here in less then 4 weeks possibly and on the other we may have complications like him being born still born. :'( .",
