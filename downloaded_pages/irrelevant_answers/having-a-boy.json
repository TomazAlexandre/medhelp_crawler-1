            "answer": "Yeah, they measure your baby and that isn't 100% accurate. Each month i get different due dates from 1 day to even a week earlier. My gyneacologist said they use the first given date as the official due date tho. As long the date isn't to far of from the original one, al it means is that your baby is on schedule with growth etcI'm pretty sure too about when my baby was conceived, and that means my first due date is quite accurate.",
