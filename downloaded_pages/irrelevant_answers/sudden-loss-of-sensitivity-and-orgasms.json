            "answer": "Thank you Rezelle for your reply.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure is now back well below the norm and my Dr has taken me off the BP tabs. I guess I would be carrying some stress from the radical change that has happened, even though I am trying to be calm about it whilst looking for answers. What does get me is the way that the orgasms stopped so suddenly, I would have thought that would be a gradual lessening.Since I posted my question, I have had a VERY slight sensation (like an orgasm with a blanket over it!) is the best way I can explain it, a very dampened down orgasm, not anything like I have been used to till now.Can you tell me if there is a way to find out if it is irreversible and if it is in fact nerve damageThank you",

            "answer": "Firstly, you'll want to discuss your concerns with your doctor, who should be on alert for symptoms of autonomic neuropathy. You'll want to mention if you've experienced any other abnormalities (such as any other sexual difficulties). He or she can formally diagnose the issue and prescribe medication based on your symptoms that may reverse the current damage and prevent more from occurring. You may feel uncomfortable discussing the issue, but it's important to know if you need treatment. Simultaneously, you might also try to reduce your stress level and see if you can regain the stronger sensation that way.",

            "answer": "I have an appointment to see my Dr in a weeks time and will certainly be discussing this with him further. I am lucky in that he is a great Dr and will work with it till there are some answers and a solution. I guess it is just that I am trying to find others who have had this problem, but I have not read anywhere of others with same. A lot is written about neuropathy but not what can be done to overcome it (if that is possible)Thank you for your replies Rezelle",

    "question": "I have always had very strong orgasms very easily with my husband, mostly in the missionary position, but sometimes in other positions as well. However, I was diagnosed with Diabetes 2 about 15 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. put me on blood pressure, cholesterol, and Metformin tabs (for the sugar) and I also had a lifestyle change and lost 11Kilos, now weighing 68 kgs (target is 65K)\u00a0\u00a0With all this changing etc, my sugar, cholesterol and blood pressure have all come down under the target goals. GREAT, But, my big problem is that my loss of sensitivity and orgasms have gone.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr took me off the blood pressure tabs altogether and halved the cholesterol tabs (to half a one per day), and the following week after that I had good orgasms, then after that week, all sensitivity went again and no more orgasms.\u00a0\u00a0I am searching for answers as to why it has happened so quickly from being so full on sexually to no feeling in the clitoral area at all. I know that nerve damage can happen with Diabetes, but would that happen so suddenly with no prior warnings?\u00a0\u00a0and if that is what it is, can this be changed, is there any medication or something that can be done to help get back the orgasms etcThank you for reading this and any information would be greatly recievedsandgroper",
