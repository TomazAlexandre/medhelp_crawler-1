            "answer": "You should confirm with his \"eye doctor\" that the eyes are normal but just in need of glasses. Most likely he's myopic or near-sighted. That is very common. Simple myopia is not a disease. Myopia can occur in anyone. I\"m myopic and no one else in my family is nearsighted. You should discuss diabetes with your peditrician. Certainly myopia does not raise the suspicion of diabetes unless it fluctuates wildly from week to week.JCH MD",

Is this a common occurance?\u00a0\u00a0I know abnormal vision is not normal but do you see this abrupt of a change in children very often? Is there any underlying conditions that we should be looking for that causes changes in vision?\u00a0\u00a0No one else in the family has any vision trouble.\u00a0\u00a0We do not even wear glasses.\u00a0\u00a0My son is over weight and my father-in-law is diabetic....is there a possibility of diabetes?? He does not seem to have any other symptoms though?? Should I monitor a fasting glucose??Thanks for some info...A Worried Mother",
