            "answer": "Thanks guys! I didn't have Gestational Diabetes during the pregnancy but my blood sugar levels were a bit high for a few days before I had him. We knew he would be big; I had scans every month during the pregnancy and he was always on the 90th centile throughout. His older brother was a big baby too; he was 8 weeks early but still weighed 4lbs 13oz. I am only 4ft 11in so I can tell you I was getting very uncomfortable and was quite grateful when they said they were able to do the c sect at 37 weeks!Must go now got a newborn to see too! (Thank goodness my inlaws are here to look after my toddler!)",

            "answer": "Hmm... c sect not something I would ever choose to do but then not as bad as I was expecting either. The first couple of days were quite painful, all I would say is take the strongest meds they can offer you those first few days. I was up the next day though making bathroom trips and such and now a few days later at home it isn't really painful anymore just aching and some discomfort; you do have to be really careful not to strech, strain or lift anything, even coughing or sneezing I have to hold the incision scar so as not to hurt myself. I think you do need to get out of bed and get moving to help the healing but you also need lots of rest, fluids and nutritious food too to keep yourself going too.",

    "question": "Hi everyone, haven't been on for a week or so as my baby boy, Samuel Travis Hall arrrived by c sect on the 4th january. I went into hospital on the 1st with contractions, had to stay in on bed rest and on iv fluids for a day or so. Baby was still breech and my amniotic fluid levels were rsing and I was starting to get high blood sugar levels. On the 2nd they did and amnio to check lung maturity which was fine so scheduled the c section for the moring of the 4th; 3 weeks prior to my due date. Unfortunatly after 4 attempts the spinal had only taken on the left hand side of my body so I had to be put under general anesthetic. Baby was born at 10.26 am weighing 8lb 10oz. He had to have a day in the special care unti as he had fluid on his lungs and a low blood sugar level for the fist 18 hours or so. It was wonderful to be reunited with him the following evening. Nursing took a few days to get used to as they had given him formula in the special care unit to get his sugar levels rising, but he is doing great now nursing now that we are home. How is everyone else, any more new babies in the last week or so from our January due date moms??",
