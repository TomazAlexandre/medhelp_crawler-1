            "answer": "If you run a search you will find this question has been asked several times on this site. I will give you my opinion: I don't think there is any specific evidence of marijuana having a direct negative effect on diabetes. However, as you know, type 1 diabetes takes a lot of focus, attention, and self-awareness, and if you are high you might not be as aware if you are having high or low blood sugars. Then there are the munchies which could make you eat a bunch of junk that would increase your blood sugars. Those are the concerns I would have. Perhaps someone else will contribute other views, or you could look through old posts.",

            "answer": "Hey, smoking anything is harder on a T1 diabetic because depending on your BG controlcardiovascular damage is a real concern. I am pretty sure you don't use a filter (and bongsdon't count).\u00a0\u00a0You may want to reflect on all that particulate matter you have drawn into to your lungs that never goes away.\u00a0\u00a0There is also some evidence that eating marijuana canaffect your gut and lead to gastroparesis- another complication of diabetes, I could go on and on.\u00a0\u00a0I know you are only 18 and probably still in fairly decent health Ivan but mj is just not a good idea no matter how you try to reassure yourself it is. I do not judge you, I was young ONCE. But you have your whole life ahead and I think yout funds could be spent in a fun and safe way.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck fella, I am pulling for you.",

    "question": "Hi I am 18 now and have had type One Diabeties since I was 9. Now I Have smoked Mj before and did so ocasionally from then but I still dont know or cant find substansual evidence that its worse for diabetics. Now the other things is most people when they hear about Marijuana they all think its all the same and that its laced. Yes I agree that you do find laced marijuana but just like you have different wines, you also get different types of Mj. It depends where you buy from and how it was grown. See instead of smoking Soo much and for a long time I simply pay more, for better quality and maybe smoke once a week, Is that still bad ?Sorry If this question wasn't appropriate for this site, I really wasn't sure but I had to ask.ThanksIvan",
