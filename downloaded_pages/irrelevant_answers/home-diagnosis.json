            "answer": "You're welcome. However, \" It seems I should speak to my doc.\" is unnecessary as you can make lifestyle changes now, without doctors assistance, to reverse your condition before you turn into a full blown diabetic.Test before eating [preprandial] to get a baseline level, then 2-3 hours after eating. This will tell you how the foods you've eaten affected your glucose levels.Postprandial levels for diabetics 2-3 hours after a meal is <7.8 mmol/l, optimum <6.72. Currently you want be at or very near normal fasting levels.This is what you needed to do starting yesterday:Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way in reversing your condition. Proper nutrition is one key; restrict & avoid refined sugars, refrain from eating \u201csimple\u201d carbohydrates, starches, and foods made with white flour - white breads, pasta, crackers, white rice and starches like potatoes - as these turn into sugar after eating. Practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of 30 minute physical exercise daily [walking], practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These are all important in managing this illness, the most important, along with proper nutrition, is physical activity.1. Ignore them and you will need doctors assistance to prescribe medication.2. Ignore them further and you will need to inject insulin.3. Ignore them even further and serious diabetes side effects come into playGood luck.",
