            "answer": "Lisa, I am on Copaxone 10 months now and have never had a physical reaction other than site issues every now and again. You are right, copaxone is the dmd with the least amount of side effects.\u00a0\u00a0 And it's not known to interact negatively with other meds.Have you read all the literature that comes with the medicine? Just thinking it may say it's possible to have what you describe as a side effect.\u00a0\u00a0Back aches and muscle aches definately can be MS related. Not so much with the headaches.I would check with your dr or call Shared Solutions or Perscription Solutions for further info.Julie",

After 6 mos of injecting I had the heart attack like symptom one evening from it.-Kelly",
