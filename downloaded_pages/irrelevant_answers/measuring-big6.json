            "answer": "It could be the way the baby is positioned, the amount of fluid you have or maybe you will deliver a few weeks early. If they haven't given you a new due date then I'm not sure. I am 29 weeks measuring 30 so I'm measuring a week early myself. Your conception date could also be a little off. You're considered full term at 37 weeks.. next time you go if you're still measuring big I'd ask if you have a new due date...",

        },
        {
            "answer": "Well when I was there I asked if that meant I wouldn't make it to my due date but all my doctor said was that it's hard to tell if I'll make it or not and once I hit 35 weeks (which is this Friday) if I go into labor they won't stop it. He didn't say anything snot a change in due date though which is weird. They also did a biophysical profile and they said the amount of fluid is good so she must really just be a big baby lol. I have gestational diabetes though so that's not super surprising to me, I'm just worried she's going to get too big.",

            "answer": "Hmm well you can always wait it out abd then try to naturally induce yourself? I'm sure as your due date gets closer abd they keep measuring you week by week they'll be able to tell more... my cousin is pregnant she also has gestational diabetes and high blood pressure and they said they might try to induce her at 37 weeks.",
