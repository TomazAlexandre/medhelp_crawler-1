            "answer": "Hi there,I watched a Documentary today (RPA) on a patient that had sleep-apnea of 500 episodes in an 8 hour period!\u00a0\u00a0His only symptoms was being tired all the time!\u00a0\u00a0I also thought of how horrible it must be to live like that!When I read your post I could not help but wonder:\u00a0\u00a0could you be a surgical candidate and maybe even the sleep-issues will improve?I was on 60-80mg of Nexium and after about 3 years of going through a lot of tests and alternatives I ended up having the Nissen Fundoplication on the 8th of Feb. 2012 and due to the longstanding GERD I have long segment of Barrets and damage to UES muscle.What type of tests have you undergone so far?",

            "answer": "Hi there,I have always tried to go the natural root first - do not sleep flat on your back - elevate head of bed - do not eat 3hrs before going to bed - avoid acid triggers - no smoking - not overweight - eat 5 small meals during the day, when that did not work I went on 20-40-60-80 mg Nexium, Gaviscon before meals and eventually Surgery.Make sure that you have done all the necessary lifestyle changes (above) and Gaviscon is a safe option to use as well.",
