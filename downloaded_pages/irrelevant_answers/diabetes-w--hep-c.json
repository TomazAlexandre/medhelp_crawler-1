            "answer": "Thank you all for your help. It's very encouraging to hear that tx is still possible with diabetes. We are still in the process of waiting for all the testing supplies. My hubby will be on 30 mg of Actos daily. I will do some research to make sure it's not too hard on the liver.Pigeon, thank you for telling me about sulfonureas. I need to know about meds for diabetes as I have no clue right now. I'm sorry your diabetes is progressing, but at least it is treatable.Rangle, I'm glad your tx is going well. Keep it up :)!Flguy, I saw an article saying that some older studies linked more severe fibrosis to diabetes, but that further studies didn't back it up. Sooner or later we'll find out what my hubby's liver condition is. His mom had diabetes, but his eating habits were also really bad. Now that I'm reading the labels on food, I'm shocked! Hubby used to eat 3 or 4 yogurts a night- they had 36 grams of sugar EACH! Now I'm supervising his diet and he's being surprisingly compliant. I'm making a chart to keep track of everything. Just making breakfast seems so complicated now, but I'm sure I'll get used to it.And the about the Girl Scout cookies- they are just too good. My daughter isn't into being a Girl Scout, but I would force her to join if I could get free cookies. Hell, I'd force my son to join if I could get free cookies!Thanks again for the help and advice.Best wishes and prayers,Dee",

            "answer": "You might try to worry less about the sugar content right now, and concentrate on the net carbs; things like processed flour, potatoes, pasta, and the like will push me up as badly as Snickers bars (yum!).Fruit juice can be a problem; whole fruit in moderation is better due to fiber content. I could go on and on, but you probably get the drift. Ask for a referral to a diabetes education class- they will have a educating RN, and possibly a dietitian to help you plan meals.For instance, I eat 7 times a day; breakfast, lunch and dinner: 60 grams carbs each. Then 4 between meal snacks of 30 grams carbs each, for a total daily carb intake of 300 CHOg.These requirements will vary according to individual needs, but it\u2019ll give you an idea to start with.There is a strong connection between HCV, type II DM, and metabolic syndrome- some studies show even moderate IR (insulin resistance) can have a significant adverse effect on HCV treatment. Make sure this is discussed with the treating doctor.All things being equal, I\u2019d rather manage HCV than diabetes any day. Proper DM management requires constant patient vigilance, and remember that DM kills FAR more people than HCV ever will- it\u2019s not something to be dismissed, unfortunately :o).Grrrr, DM is a b!tch to manage, LOL- can you tell by my rant :o)?Rant done, take care\u2014Bill",

            "answer": "Thank you all so much- I'm sure you all know how I felt today. A new dx to deal with, tons of questions and confusion, not really sure how upset I \"should\" be or how this will affect our life... but every time I check back on the board I feel better. Because you all are here to give advice and share experiences, and I know I'll learn (slowly, of course!) what I need to know to keep hubby well. I was as ignorant about Hep C as I am about diabetes when I found this forum- now, while I still get lost on the more \"technical\" discussions- I know enough about Hep C to run circles around my husband's PCP. Hmmm- that's not such a good thing, is it?Upbeat- Y'know, as soon as I started reading about diabetes and how the liver is involved in managing insulin, I thought there had to be a connection. I mean, if the liver isnn't functioning right, at least a couple things are bound to go wrong as a result. Looks like this is one of them. I appreciate your mentioning those meds. I'm very nervous about the med my hubby's doctor prescribed- Actos. It says to consult your phsician if you have active liver disease. My hubby's PCP has already screwed up with a dx and a med with my husband, so I'm not letting him take this Actos until either one of you on this forum says it's OK, or hubby's gastro calls me back and gives me the green light.Pigeon, I will be sure to kinda doublecheck the info the nurse advisor gave me, just in case. And I'll remember about taking the readings after meals- thank you!Bill- Thank you for the guideline on how many carbs my hubby should get. I was puzzled over that, since I read to be careful of carbs but know that everyone must have a certain amount. That will be a great help as I plan my husband's meal/snack schedule. Sounds like you really have it down :).Mike- Funny you should say that, about thinking HCV is harder to manage than diabetes. When I was discussing his diabetes dx with my hubby, I said,\"Look, I'd way rather be dx'ed with diabetes than Hep C!\" My thinking was that diabetes can't hurt you as long as you keep your blood sugar in control, whereas Hep C sometimes just takes over no matter how healthy your lifesyle is. But I'm beginning to see that diabetes is not always within control... I guess the bottom line is that it sux to have either of these diseases, but life must go on.Flguy- Good for you on your plan to take the best care of yourself possible. Hey, you earned the right to be healthy! But I know what you mean- during tx, anything that makes you feel better is justified (to a point- lol)- and now that you're done you hafta go back to fighting yourself on whether or not to have that icecream, Girl Scout cookie, etc etc.Well, I guess I'd better go start dinner. I feel like cooking is so important now- that if I don't feed hubby regularly or put too much butter or sugar in something, the world is gonna end. I'll get the hang of it though- and I'm thinking of all the weight I'll lose too!Prayers and hugs to all of you,Dee",

I guess that's pretty high. He took his 1st Actos pill this morning, and I'm not sure if the doctor is gonna give us the blood sugar testing stuff- or if I should go buy it. Our health insurance should cover it, but I'm gonna look in the drugstore today anyway. Thank you for your info on Actos- I feel better about him taking it now. I'm working on a meal/snack plan now- it's hard cuz I don't want to seem punishing, like \"No, you can't have this- no, none of that either!\" I know my hubby already thinks I'm a big beeotch much of the time- don't wanna make it any worse ;)! Oh yeah- I saw an article today on Yahoo about diabetes and heart health. It said it is very difficult to get A1C levels below 7, and that most people never accomplish it. It also said that a recent study on the benefits of diabetics lowering blood sugar to non-diabetic levels was halted due to some unexplained deaths. The study seems somewhat contradictory, as it also said that for each point the blood sugar is lowered it cuts the risk of heart and kidney failure by 20-40%.But that now there is some doubt on whether going extremely low is desirable- I can't remember everything exactly, and don't want to give wrong info though. You could check it out- I don't know how to cut & paste links- but it's on the Yahoo home page today.Alagirl,That must be quite a worry with your son, but it sounds like you're handling it great. The fact that you motivated him enough to stay on a healthy diet much of the time is wonderful! It must be difficult when you're in the hospital, but hopefully as he matures he will become more responsible about his diet on his own. As for my hubby's diet, we are going to see a nutritionist on the 12th, and until then I'm just doing my own research and following the advice of my friends on Medhelp :). From the chart I looked at, he needs 7 starches, 3 dairy, 4 veggies, 3 fruits, and 4-6 ounces of meat a day. Yikes- I feel like I'm never gonna leave the kitchen!!\u00a0\u00a0But I'll get used to it.

I have been reading the nutrition labels on everything and keeping a daily list of what hubby eats. Thank you for warning me about the sugarfree desserts- that really is a scam!

    "question": "Hi Everyone,Well my hubby has been dx'ed with diabetes. He had been having excessive thirt, URGENT urination, and had lost 12 lbs without even trying. I kinda knew what it was before we even went to the doc, so I prepared him for it. Basically, nobody likes to be dx'ed with anything, but this is not too bad. It just means that our eating habit must change for the better, I have to stop whining to go out to eat all the time for a while, and he HAS to start taking daily walks with me, as I have been begging him to do forever :) As long as he keeps his blood sugar under control, I think he'll be fine.But I do have a lot of learning to do. I did a quick search online and found a couple articles linking hep c infection to diabetes type 2, which is what my hubby has.My questions are, has anyone else been dx'ed with diabetes 2, and do you have any advice for us? And, had anyone tx'ed for hep c with diabetes? Are there any special complications?Thanks!-Dee",
