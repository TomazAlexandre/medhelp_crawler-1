I pay attention to healthy diet and I exercise a lot and I still can not lose any weight.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diagnosed with hashimoto's disease a month ago. My GP transferred me to check my glucose and insulin levels. Maybe that is why I can not lose my weight. My aunt has diabetes so I am may have diabetes in the futer.",

            "answer": "Hi,My Doctor has tested TSH, FT3, FT4, aTPO and aTG. Sometimes my TSH is very high but usually is in the normal range and that is why my GP does not want to treat me. I have to check TSH every 3 months and will get treated when TSH will be high all the time. Do you think my GP is right? I do not feel very well and can not get any tablets from him.I have very healthy diet and active lifestyle- I cycle to work 5 days a week, about 40 minutes each way. Thank you for suggesting me low carb diet I will try to cut out some carbs from my diet.P.S. Sorry for my English.",
