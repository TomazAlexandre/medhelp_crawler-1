            "answer": "Its normal, your body needs more water due to all the extra activities going on. My doctor asked me how many bottles of water I drink daily. I told him about 4. He told me to double that amount. Also, he said if I'm ever thirsty that's not go, because more than likely I'm dehydrated. So basically we must drink lots of water, because our body needs it all. Good luck!",
