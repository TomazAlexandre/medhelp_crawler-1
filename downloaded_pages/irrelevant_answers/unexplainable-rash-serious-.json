            "answer": "I'm not sure what is causing your mothers itching but I'm going through the same type of thing.. I start to itch on my arm then it stops and moves to my back,stomcah, legs or butt cheeks and wherever I scratch a rash appers and when the itching stops the rash goes away.\u00a0\u00a0It is very intense and almost nothing will make it stop and then as fast as it comes on it goes away.\u00a0\u00a0I'm begining it think I'm crazy! The Doctor had me on three medicines Phentermine, topramax and despirmine for weightloss we thought it was a reaction to them so I stopped the meds and started Prednisone pills and a cream, seven days later it's only a little better and now i've been told to look up Fifth Disease it mostly affects children but adults can get it. I'm going to have the blood tests run on Monday to see if that's what it is.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you can find out what your mother has and get her some help and I'm praying that's what I have although there isn't anything you can do to stop the itching but wait it out.",

            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis). Skin conditions like psoriasis, dermatitis, eczema and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch. Lastly, Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope it helps. Take care and lease do keep me posted in case you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",

    "question": "My mother just turned 50 years old, and a couple of weeks ago she started itching on random parts of her body. The itches would appear in one area, disappear, then reappear somewhere else. She took a generic Benadryl for the first week, but stopped taking it because she's already taking a lot of medicine. She's currently being treated for Type 2 Diabetes, Hyperactive thyroid, high cholesterol, asthma, and she also has osteoporosis but she is not currently taking anything for that. I am extremely worried, but she is convinced that she is fine. She mostly itches under her breasts, on her chest (under her bra straps), her ankles, and wrists. Tiny bumps come with the rashes and for the rashes under her bra strap have dry skin looking scales on top, and she also has a slight itch in her genital regions. Could the itching be from her hyperactive thyroid medication? She's been on all of her meds for about a year now, but she refuses to go to the doctor to treat her rash because she says that she is okay. Does this sound serious, or am I just overreacting? She also has a\u00a0\u00a0dry itchy scalp but that isn't really anything new. I just don't understand why the rashes aren't going away. It's been two weeks now. Before the start of her rash, she also found this extremely old shower gel we have in our bathroom (it's probably at least 5 years old), that she actually started using. I threw it out sometime last week thinking that was the cause of her rash but she's still itching. She isn't complaining at all, I think it bothers me more than it does her, but I'm just worried it's something serious. Does it sound like it is?",
