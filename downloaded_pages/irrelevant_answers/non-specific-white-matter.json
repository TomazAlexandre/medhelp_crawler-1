            "answer": "I think this means you should consult a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0He or she can give you a clearer picture of what is going on.I think the term non specific is a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0White matter changes can mean any number of things from vascular disease to MS to migraines to seizures to normal changes that come with aging.Things like this are the most scary if you don't go looking for answers.I have multiple white matter lesions and have spent months trying to get answers.\u00a0\u00a0The neuroradiologist that read my MRI thought they were consistent with MS.\u00a0\u00a0My first neurologist thought they were from microvascular disease, though I don't have high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or diabetes or anything else that would lead to microvascular disease.Neurologist #2 did a lumbar puncture which came back normal, a spine MRI that didn't show a clear lesion, blood tests that ruled out a few other diseases,\u00a0\u00a0and decided that I didn't have MS and that she was through with me.I am now waiting for an appointment with neuro #3, and hope that she will be more willing to dig for answers.\u00a0\u00a0I have symptoms; tremors, dizziness,fatigue,\u00a0\u00a0occasional lack of balance, etc.I stopped being scared when I read the MRI results, and got ready to face head on whatever challenge was coming my way.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, I am angry and frustrated because answers aren't always easy to find.\u00a0\u00a0At least the anger gives me energy to continue on my quest for answers.I hope you look for and find clear answers quickly,and that they are benign and easy to live with.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone says MS to you, come and visit the MS forum; they're really great people over there.Best of luck,Kathy",
