            "answer": "Most foods contain several different kinds of fat! Some are better for your health than others. Some fats help promote good health in moderation.Your body makes its own fat from taking in excess calories. Some fats are found in foods from plants and animals and are known as dietary fat. Dietary fat is one of the three macronutrients, along with protein and carbohydrates, that provide energy for your body. Fat is needed for your health because it supports a number of your body's functions. Some vitamins, must have fat to dissolve and nourish your body.The problem with some types of dietary fat (and their cousin cholesterol) is that they are thought to play a role in cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Dietary fat also may have a role in other diseases, including obesity and cancer.The two main types of harmful dietary fat Saturated fat. This is a fat that comes mainly from animal sources of food. Saturated fat raises total blood cholesterol levels and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels, which can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease. Saturated fat may also increase your risk of type 2 diabetes.Trans fat. This is a\u00a0\u00a0fat that occurs naturally in some foods, especially foods from animals. But most trans fats are made during food processing through partial hydrogenation of unsaturated fats. This creates fats that are easier to cook with and less likely to spoil than are naturally occurring oils.\u00a0\u00a0Research studies show that synthetic trans fat can increase unhealthy LDL cholesterol and lower healthy high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. This can increase your risk of cardiovascular disease.Most fats that have a high percentage of saturated fat or trans fat are solid at room temperature. Because of this, they're typically referred to as solid fats. They include beef fat, pork fat, shortening, stick margarine and butter.The two types of helpful dietary fat Monounsaturated fat. This is a fat found in a variety of foods and oils. Eating foods rich in monounsaturated fats improves blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease. Research shows monounsaturated fats may benefit insulin levels and blood sugar control, which can be especially helpful if you have type 2 diabetes.Polyunsaturated fat. This is found mostly in plant-based foods and oils. Evidence shows that eating foods rich in polyunsaturated fats improves blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease. and may also help decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes. One type of polyunsaturated fat, omega-3 fatty acids, may be especially beneficial to your heart. Omega-3s, found in some types of fatty fish, appear to decrease the risk of coronary artery disease. They may also protect against irregular heartbeats and help lower blood pressure levels.Foods made up mostly of monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats are liquid at room temperature, such as olive oil, safflower oil, peanut oil and corn oil.",

            "answer": "0% transfat packages are allowed to contain 0.5% of transfat per serving. If that product contains 20 servings, that is 10 grams of transfat in your 0% transfat labelled package.\u00a0\u00a0Transfat keeps the product on the supermarket shelf for longer. That is profit over health plain and simple.",

            "answer": "I would like a more precise answer to this question. The question is that mathematically, even on labels where every type of fat is quantified, the total fat is always higher than the total constituent fats. I know which ones are good and bad. I want someone to explain the math because it NEVER adds up.",

            "answer": "The constituent components of fat (trans, sat, poly, mono, chol) are estimated and often rounded down (since many people are concerned about consuming too much). The total fat is to most accurate number. I combine the poly and mono fat numbers and consider that the &#39;good&#39; fat, and subtract that from the total fat to get the &#39;bad&#39; fat content, since trans, sat, and chol are all worse forms of fat. It&#39;s not exact, but leads to a pretty good approximation for evaluating your healthy food intake.",
