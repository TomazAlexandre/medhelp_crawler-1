Trust me once the baby is farther along you will feel him no matter what size you are!",

    "question": "I'm 27 with my first pregnancy and now at 20 wks 4 days. I am a diabetic who is considered obese with now tight control of my diabetes and have no idea what the first fluttered feel like. Everything I've read says I should be feeling baby move more and more, but nothing. I have also read that I should know when he's sleeping and awake... Is that normal? I feel that because I'm heavy I can't feel him yet? All these things are going through my head...please help.",
