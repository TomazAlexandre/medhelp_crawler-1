            "answer": "I'm afraid I can't join up the dots for you, but if you haven't already, you might want to get checked out for diabetes (since you mention PCOS and nerve symptoms). It's important to get your post-prandial (post-meal) blood glucose checked as well as your fasting BG, as you can be diabetic with normal fasting BG.",

    "question": "I have been slightly unhealthy my entire life, but these past few years, it seems like I am falling apart at such a young age. I've been diagnosed with so many different things, and I don't know if any of them are connected. Could it be that I really have a ton of small problems, or just one big one!?I have terrible anxiety. I work very minimally and I can't work more than 10 or 15 hours absolute max. I am applying for disability. I am diagnosed bi-polar and borderline personality disorder. I have been hospitalized.I also have physical problems. I have diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, (unexplained weight loss, loss of appetite, blood tests), acid reflux(heartburn, throwing up), Poly cystic Ovarian Syndrome(Lack of periods, ovarian cysts, my hormones were off, among other things), I've been to the doctor for back and neck problems. I have terrible spasms in my neck and have back pain almost daily.Sometimes, usually at night(after 6pm) my fingers start to tingle. It then spreads to my arms and my face. The doctors didn't seem concerned, but it drives me absolutely crazy.I have leg spasms in the middle of the night, sometimes during the day. They aren't painful, but I can literally see my muscle moving and it keeps me awake. Sometimes at night, I can't sleep because my legs bother me. I can't explain the feeling, I just can't get them comfortable.I don't know if it matters, but I've noticed within the last year that when it gets hot my rings that I wear get tight, and also at night time. Sometimes I have a hard time getting them off, or putting them on.What the heck is wrong with me!",
