            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!It can be bladder debris. Parasitic infections like schistosomiasis and filariasis can result in worms in urine which appear as fleshy substances. Infections like trichomoniasis can produce mucus threads in urine. Fungal infections like candidiasis too cause fleshy substance in urine. Bladder cancer, polyps and stones are other reasons.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult an urologist for this. Collect the urine sample with fleshy substance in it and get it examined at a lab. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
