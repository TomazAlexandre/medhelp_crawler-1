Consumption of foods with a low glucose levels appears to reduce postprandial glucose rise and improve glycemic control. Reduced calorie and nonnutritive sweeteners(better avoided in epileptics) are useful. Fat should make up 20-35%, caloric intake per day with saturated fat < 7% of total calories, Carbohydrates should make 40-65% of total caloric intake, proteins should make 10-35% of total caloric intake per day. Fibre rich diets help reduce caloric intake. Keep checking your blood sugar levels regularly for good glycemic control to avoid diabetic complications.Excercise daily for minimum of 30min. Avoid crash diets as they can be bad for your health.
