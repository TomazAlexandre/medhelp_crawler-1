            "answer": "I don't have diabetes so I'm not the right one to answer this. We do, though, have quite a few diabetic members who can help here.But as to asking for specific tests, I suggest you tread carefully. It's never a good idea to seem to be dictating to your doctor. That also could come across as disease-shopping or too much Googling, even though that's far from your intent.I think it's perfectly okay to ask a question such as, \"Could I have diabetes with normal glucose levels\"? That's quite different from \"I want more diabetes testing regardless of my glucose levels.\"So concentrate on coming across as just inquiring and wanting to learn. I think you'll get better results that way. Good luck to you.ess",

            "answer": "You are so right. Honestly I never googled when I first got symptoms almost 20 yrs ago, just assumed it was pinched nerve.\u00a0\u00a0Always went away in 6-8 weeks and was only numbness.\u00a0\u00a0This one lasting so long with so many other symptoms I did google and was shocked at what I could be.While I know it is important not to lead the doctors it's just funny to me that they would think that this is something that I could want when in fact I am desperately looking for it to be something else.I stopped googling weeks ago b/c I felt I had all I needed and just needed to let the tests speak for themselves. This blog has been a God-send of information.\u00a0\u00a0I will ask doctor what she thinks and take it from there.\u00a0\u00a0Just curious though if hot feet and cold body are symtoms of MS or while they may not be \"normal\", all seems to be within the norm of MS since it presents differently in everyone?Thanks for your reply.Julie",

            "answer": "Gosh, I do understand where you're coming from. You just have to make sure the doctors do too.Weird temperature feelings are common in MS. If your feet felt hot and you soaked them in cold water, that cooled them off, so it was quite a reasonable thing to do. But what if your feet just 'felt' hot? Cooling them down made the rest of you cold.Next time, try just squeezing out a wash cloth in cold water and rubbing your feet as needed. Or go barefoot indoors.The reason that MS presents differently in each patient is that we have a gazillion nerves and nerve pathways. We have nerves 'coming and going.' We have dozens of nerves just for sensory info---hot, cold, itchy, burning, and on and on. Any of these can get disrupted and cause weirdness and/or pain. It would be strange if others had the exact malfunctions that we have, considering all the possibilities.Good luck in getting to the bottom of things. Keep at it!essGood l",

    "question": "Okay, so I am awaiting dx for whatever I have although neurologist seems to think MS is likely.\u00a0\u00a0It's been four months since my last episode of numbness, tingling and tightness.\u00a0\u00a0Slowly it is going away but seems to flare up and I take a few steps back when I am overly stressed.Yesterday I had new symptom, hot feet (had to put them in cold water to help with discomfort). Curiously though the rest of my body got cold.I have boarderline hypothyroidism (doctor will be retesting me this friday) but she didn't give me diabetes test b/c my glucose levels were completely normal.My question is could I have diabetes wtih normal glucose levels?\u00a0\u00a0Is a diabetes test something I should request when I go back on Friday along with the thyroid recheck?\u00a0\u00a0I know it's possible to have MS and other medical challenges but I don't want to come across as someone who is asking for things that make no sense medically.Thanks,Julie",
