            "answer": "Hi Heather,Type 1 and Type 2 seem to be different and they don't know what clearly waht causes them though definitely there is a genetic predisposition.Type 1 seems to be autoimmune and results in the pancreas B cells being destroyed.\u00a0\u00a0What triggers the autoimmune reaction, in some cases an illness, pregnancy, and other cases unknown. Insulin is always required as treatment.Type 2 has insulin resistance as a major factor and lifestyle plays a big role, though there could also be something autoimmune going on.\u00a0\u00a0Weight normalisation, exercise and lower carb diet can be very helpful and even arrest or apparently revers the condition.\u00a0\u00a0However, if long term high blood sugars persist B cells can also be destroyed and insulin is required..",
