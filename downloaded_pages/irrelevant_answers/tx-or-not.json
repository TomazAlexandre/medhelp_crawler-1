            "answer": "What is your age and your genotype?While you don't want to aggravate any existing problems, grade 2 stage 2 is something you're probably going to have to deal with eventually. In your position, I'd get my thyroid checked, get checked out for RA factors, and do as much reading as possible in order to make an informed decision. This is a slow moving disease and if you take 6 months to a year to decide, other options may present themselves that will allow you to do treatment with less exposure to IFN.Good luck.

            "answer": "I'm 54,Geno1a, stage 1, grade 0. VL 470,000. Diagnosed 2003 and opted for the treatment 2006. During the 48 week course I was diagnosed with Hypothyroid (meds screw with your thyroid). My treatment ended June 8th but relapsed Sept. Because of my low VL and stage I probably could've waited for better drugs to come along but decided to treat instead. Like desrt said, eventually you're going to have to deal with it. When is up to you. Find out as much as you can before you commit yourself. I'm not sure how much being a diabetic will play into it though. If your doc can't provide you with some good information your best bet is to find a specialist who deals with Hep C. Good luck!",

            "answer": "I am sorry to hear you have this disease like the rest of us. I do have a question though as you mentioned Peripheral Neuropathy. What exactly are your symptoms. The reason I ask is I have had foot pain/ numbness for a few years I went to a podiatrist and he said I had Morton's Neuroma. I tried orthodics and anti- inflammatories and all the other stuff they recommend and mostly just lived with it until a few , months ago it became very intense. It would wake me up out of a dead sleep and keep me up half the night with intense burning sensation radiating down into my toes. Keep in mind this are all symptoms of Morton's Neuroma. I have had 2 cortisone injections and a freaking $400 orthodic made. it is still bothering me. The next step they say is surgery or injections to kill the nerve in my foot (which I have absolutely no desire to do). Anyway back\u00a0\u00a0to the point I had read about Peripheral Neuropathy as a symptom of HCV and wondered is it possible that is what I have? Do not get me wrong I am not a hypochondriac and do not look for things to be wrong with me but can not help but wonder if there is any link when I read this. I have been getting more and more symptomatic in the last year or so and am beginning to wonder about all of my aches and pains. I too have been wrestling with whether to treat or not. My stance has always been to wait since I was only Stage 2 grade 2 but I have been second guessing myself lately.",
