See a dentist, I have gum issues too always have, at 21 I had to have a scaling and antibiotics injected into my gum line because my gums are softer than they should be and tend to get infected easy.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, get it checked. Maybe there is a localized patch of infection or inflammation and this could be due to repeated injury from the tooth brush or it can be an allergy from mouth wash. Also get your blood sugar checked for diabetes as this can delay healing. Vit C deficiency can also cause sore gums. Iron and Vit B deficiency can cause ulcers in the gum. So take a multivitamin with combination of these.Do discuss this with your doctor and get your gums examined. Take care!",

    "question": "So for the past week or so, my upper right gums have been sore and raw, painfulwhenever I brush my teeth.\u00a0\u00a0This is the same area in my gums where I was cut open a while ago in order to remove a (harmless!) cyst from my right sinus, and which was numb for several months afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0I've looked, and can't really spot a visible difference, though it might look a little red, and there may or may not be a small circular bump.\u00a0\u00a0I've been having recurring nightmares of my teeth falling out since, well, forever, so I've been brushing and using mouthwash a lot lately, but there isn't any pain on the other side, or on the lower gums.\u00a0\u00a0I'm kind of a hypochondriac, and I'm afraid this might be oral cancer or something (which it isn't, I know!); it's just that, while I've occasionally had sore gums before, it's never lasted more than a day or two.\u00a0\u00a0So what should I do?\u00a0\u00a0I'm only 20, and I don't smoke or drink, so I shouldn't be getting any serious health problems yet, right?\u00a0\u00a0Should I get this checked out, or do I not need to worry?",
