Your son needs to be evaluated by an Endocrinologist, a doctor that specializes in diabetes.\"should we be worried??? \"Yes, those morning fasting readings are high and indicate type 2 diabetes. But only a thorough evaluation and testing by an Endo will tell what he has. Times to test at home are before meals [prandial] and 2-3 hours after a meal [postprandial] when sugars from foods are at the highest. By keeping a log of his postprandial test results you'll know what he can and cannot eat, and/or the amount that is acceptable to his body. Limit intake of bad carbs, white foods - potatoes, white bread, white rice, foods made with white flour - as these turn into sugar after eating.",

            "answer": "Hi,The NP was very wrong that the numbers are normal.\u00a0\u00a0By telling you not to test she is denying that you as parents know that something is definitely wrong.\u00a0\u00a0If you follow her advice your son would be in very serious trouble.I think it is more likely that your son is in the relatively early stages of developing type 1 diabetes.His numbers are very abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0Children's numbers should actually be a little lower than adults.\u00a0\u00a0In any case normal fasting numbers should be less than about 90 to be normal and 2 hours after eating they should be < 120.Your son should see a pediatrician urgently.\u00a0\u00a0If your GP blows him off insist to get referred.\u00a0\u00a0There is something very wrong and without treatment it could become life-threatening.\u00a0\u00a0You could also take him to the ER if he is having symptoms.Please let us know how you and your son go.",
