That has to be the worst symptom of pregnancy and I could have done without it.Seems to me that all else is doing well. I wish you a healthy, happy eight more seven more months (if you make it that far having twins).",

            "answer": "I was one of the weird ones with NO nausea AT ALL. I never felt bad once during my whole preg but I was tired a lot. I actually had someone tell me that it was a bad sign that I felt so good, that it meant the preg wouldn't last!! I was worried and I went to my Dr and she said I was one of the lucky few!! She said It was Bull crud that I was SUPPOSED to feel sick and as a matter of fact, she was the mother of twins she carried and she said other than being VERY tired, she never threw up! She said she remembered feeling not so hot a few times, but never \"got sick\". Don't worry, besides, if she isn't sick, she can eat more which is better for the babies than an empty tummy.",

    "question": "Hi ladies,My gestational carrier (surrogate) is 9wks1day pregnant with my twins. She had nausea from week 6 through amost to week 9, but never actually got sick. Staring a couple of days ago she stopped feeling sick, but is still tired and extremely hungry. She had an ultraound at 8wks2days and everything looked great. Both babies were measuring on target and both had a good heartrate, 172&176bpm. I'm worried that she has miscarried either one or both of the babies. Is it every normal for nausea to end around the 9th week? ThanksCarisa",
