            "answer": "IDK ur age, but when I was a late teen, I had alot of hormone fluctuations that made me feel the same way. On top of that, they freaked me out and sent me into panic attacks. You should try a diet in non-processed foods (like veggies and fruits, wheat breads, etc) with a multi-vitamin. Also, you might want to check your home to see if you have any leaking gases or mold. Definitely check with your doc, to have this for 4 years is painful to deal with, and I'm sure your isolating yourself from people from fear of these happening. You deserve a better quality of life than that!!!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!From you symptoms alone it sounds like chronic fatigue syndrome. This usually presents with widespread myalgia and arthralgia, headaches, chronic mental and physical exhaustion, cognitive difficulties, concentration difficulty and memory problems.Then you also need to investigate other causes of brain fog like liver dysfunction (get liver enzymes done\u2014liver function test), kidney dysfunction (get kidney function test done), and anemia. Poor sleep pattern and sleep problems like sleep apnea too can cause brain fog. Sleep studies by sleep specialists can help diagnose this. Low Vit D or Vit B12 too could be the cause.Hypothyroidism, diabetes and hormonal imbalance in women due to either menopause or any other cause like PCOD should be investigated.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
