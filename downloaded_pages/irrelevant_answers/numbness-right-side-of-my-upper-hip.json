            "answer": "HiThanks for the post! How are you now?Numbness and tingling on hip could be due to a rash or eczema. Too much pressure on one hip in a sitting job too can cause this. It could also be due to a nerve involvement due to Diabetes. The symptoms could also be early signs of compression of your spinal cord, which is a very serious condition.This needs a more detailed investigation. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining and various tests. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
