            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dark spots on buttocks which are not itchy could be due to hyperpigmentation, friction with clothes, sweat dermatitis, vitamin deficiency, dry skin, adrenal gland disorders, thyroid problems, seborrhaic warts, moles etc. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage without examining them.I would strongly recommend you to consult a skin specialist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
