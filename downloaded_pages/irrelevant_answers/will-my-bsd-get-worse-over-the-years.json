    "question": "Hi,I was recently diagnosed as bipolar 2.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know the odds of bipolar getting worse over time?\u00a0\u00a0Before I was diagnosed as having OCD/Depression.\u00a0\u00a0My depression did get worse overtime (and meds stopped working).\u00a0\u00a0My mania has been pretty constant as I look back over the years.\u00a0\u00a0I am on Lamictal now and it has worked wonders.\u00a0\u00a0Not only is my depression almost gone I feel much more level headed than I have in years.\u00a0\u00a0Not as irritable or obsessive.\u00a0\u00a0But I am worried that this is only a remission of sorts and that I will see a worsening or return.\u00a0\u00a0What are your experiences over time?",
