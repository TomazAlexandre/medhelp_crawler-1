The neck thingy, I can't help you with but a doctor can. You may be experiencing some sort nerve reaction but only a thorough examination by a doctor can determine the cause.",

            "answer": "The tingly thing may be something more serious that your doc can help you with, or, since it comes in conjunction with low blood sugar it might be just a symptom of that. I'm told there are a number of less common symptoms of low blood sugar that people learn to recognize as their own unique sign that they are hypoglycemic.",

    "question": "So I've never been actually tested for hypoglycemia, but I always figured I had it. I'm pregnant, and when I had my glucose test my blood sugar was low. (I'm assuming that means I probably have it?) Anyways, lately I've noticed when I'm laying down, I get this bubbly or fizzy sensation in the back of my neck. It doesn't hurt or anything, but it's the weirdest feeling, and I usually get it several times within a few minutes. I asked my husband if he ever had it and he had no idea what I was talking about. I tried to research it online, and the only thing I found was someone saying they had it and wondered if it was linked to hypoglycemia, because it was accompanied by hunger pains or a growling stomach. Anyways, I was just wondering if anyone else had this and had any idea what it was. My only other theory is I had a blood patch in my spine about 3.5 years ago because of a botched epidural, and maybe it has something to do with that? Doubtful, but just a thought.",
