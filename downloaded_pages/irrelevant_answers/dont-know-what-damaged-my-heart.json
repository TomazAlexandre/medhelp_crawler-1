            "answer": "Hi Me967-What is strange is that I have never had hypertension and I am not an insulin dependent diabetic. I was given Carvedilol, Micardis, and Spironocatone what my cardiologist is attempting to do is to slow my heart rate down but meds for slowing down my heart rate also lowers my already low normal blood pressure and then dizziness occurs. My PCP, my OB/GYN and my Opthalmologist are all alarmed but my cardiologist is not, so I guess I have to look for another cardiologist. Thanks for you help. Sandy",

            "answer": "I had a similar experience in that my ef was 46%, although my pulse was normal and my BP a little high. I've had a pretty healthy lifestyle for 45 years before my diagnosis (I'm and exercise fanatic). It sounds like you have idiopathic cardiomyopathy (no known cause). You might ask if your heart shows any signs of dilation or thickening (mine did not).\u00a0\u00a0The meds you're on may improve your ef over time. I've read a lot of accounts of Coreg raising an ef by 10-20%. My cardiologist said the rule seems to be 1/3 get better, 1/3 stay the same and 1/3 get worse. Personally my ef remained unchanged after a year of Coreg, but I'm doing okay. Apparently cardiologists evaluate not only your ef, but other factors as well such as exercise tolerance. Even thought I have a low ef, my exercise tolerance is very high, so my cardiologist is not as concerned as he might be. I spent a year and a half worrying about my number, but it's just one piece of data. My cardiologist said he's evaluated athletes applying for scholarships that have efs in the 40s. So the number has to be factored in with other data. Of course if the ef gets real low than that's more of an issue by itself. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I am a 58 y/o female who has had diabetes (non-insulin) and glaucoma since 1999. Outside of those conditions which were inherited, since every sibling on my father's side of the family and both is parents had diabetes and glaucoma. However, in November 2008, I went for my yearly physical and it was discovered that my heart rate was 130 beats per minute. I was referred to a cardiologist who performed every possible test that I am aware of and at the end of the day all he could tell me is that I have a weak heart and he does not know what caused it, and to add insult to injury he said \"doctors do not know everything.\" Granted I am well aware that doctors do not know every thing but since I never, smoked, drank alcohol, or used drugs that were not prescribed by my doctor I am quite concerned. My medical report shows my LVEF 37% and my cardiologist thinks I should not be alarmed, since he has seen worst. Can anyone help me with answers?",
