            "answer": "Hi Kichenwich,I am a volunteer here and have been living with Type I Diabetes for 12 years. As I don't have personal experience with MODY I can only direct you to some resources that will be able to better help you.First, there is an article about MODY in the Diabetes Care journal, which I think can give you some background information about the condition. It is a bit scientific but you can still get a lot out of it. You can access the article on the following website: http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/reprint/23/3/381.pdfBelow is a portion of the article regarding MODY:\"Maturity-onset diabetes of the young(MODY) is a rare form of diabetes in children that includes several disorders causedby monogenic defects in -cell function inherited in an autosomal-dominant fashion. Recent studies suggest that the clinical spectrum of MODY is broad, ranging from asymptomatic hyperglycemia to a severe acute presentation. These geneabnormalities are thought to be rare, and molecular diagnostic testing, currently only available in research laboratories, isrequired for specific classification. Until such testing becomes commonplace, children with MODY should be classified ashaving the type of diabetes that best fits their clinical picture.Individuals with type 2 diabetes do not generally have autoantibodies to -cell proteins; fasting insulin and Cpeptidelevels are usually normal or elevated,although not as elevated as might be expected for the degree of hyperglycemia.\"Other helful websites: www.cureresearch.com/m/mody_diabetes/intro.htmhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maturity_onset_diabetes_of_the_youngFinally,I would definitely advise you to seek an endocrinologist for you, your daughter and your husband. I am especially concerned about your daughter's glucose range. Your fasting glucose may also be of concern. It is difficult for me to ascertain exactly where the problem lies without having more information. I think your entire family will benefit from seeing an endocrinologist who can help you keeo the sugars under control.It seems from what I've read that MODY is in fact caused by a hereditary factor, but I don't know how probable it is for your daughter to pass it on to her children. That can be further explained by your endocrinologist as well. And by all means have your other children tested. It can't hurt and you'll feel better knowing.Good luck to you and please check in with us if you need anything else.",

            "answer": "Kitchenwich,I do not know what MODY diabetes is.\u00a0\u00a0I only know of type 1 and type 2.\u00a0\u00a0I am a type 1 diabetic and would listen to what the type 2s have to say.If you are running 160-240 and up, you are a type 2 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0You may be able to control your diabetes with a strict diet, but you may need meds to get it under control.If your\u00a0\u00a0daughter is 45-450 she is a type 2 diabetic and might need meds unless her diet can keep it between 80-120 which is the normal operating range for blood sugar readings.\u00a0\u00a0Any blood sugar reading over 150 is dangerous and needs to be kept under control.Your husband at 120-140 is a borderline type 2 diabetic and can probably keep it under control by watching his diet.I would talk to an ENDO rather than a regular Dr and I would also have the children tested.Bob",

            "answer": "Thanks for the info! The pediatric endo is the one that diagnosed the MODY. Her regular doctor told us she was hypoglycemic, and would grow out of it. We took her to another doctor for the fasting test. In the first hour she jumped to 180, and fell suddenly to 45! They rushed her to the emergency room, and have to give i.v. glucose, as she was sweating, shaking, and although her eyes were open she could not respond, even when they stuck her with the i.v. needle. We are waiting test results now to see which form of MODY she has. From what I read, there are 6 different mutated genes that can cause this. This may be why the endo didn't go into alot of detail on our last visit. One website I found at 3:00 this morning was about misdiagnosing MODY as type 2 in children, and giving too much insulin to these type kids is becoming more common, causing even more problems. The site you sent me to lead to a few other links, and all said that only 2% of the diabetics have this form. If there is anyone out there that has MODY, or knows more about the problems this can cause later, please let me know. I am SO glad I found this site, and pray that we get answers soon.",

They actually think it is a new mody that hasn't been named yet but is like mody 3. My kids will spike a high level and go down within the hour without medication. They have eaten candy and carbs and it still goes down on its own. I am so confused and not sure what if anything I should be doing. Can anyone share what their endocrin has been doing. My son is 6 and daughter is 4. I haven't tested my 2 year old yet. Thanks",

    "question": "My 15 yr old daughter was diagnosed last week with MODY diabetes. The doctor didn't go into alot of detail, but said that this is actually the easiest type to control. She isn't on any meds at this time, and is controlling her insulin with her diet. She had been running from 45 to 460, with drops of up to 150 in less than one hour. Since then we have worked on a low carb, low sugar diet on our own which seems to be working. While I was pregnant with her, I had gestational diabetes. Did this cause her MODY? My husband and I both have to test ourselves twice daily (when we first get up, and two hours after a meal), as we were told one of us would definitely have some form of diabetes. So far I have been running in the 160-245 range when I wake up, and in the 140's to 160's two hours after a meal. My husband is running in the 120's to 140's for both tests. We both have several people in our family with type 2, two close members that are Type 1, diagnosed before age 10, and several hypoglycemics. Should I have my other 2 kids tested? What are the chances that they also have MODY? I only had gestational diabetes with my daughter that was diagnosed. What's the outlook for this passing on to her children? Thanks for any info, as I am pretty confused by the hereditary stuff!",
