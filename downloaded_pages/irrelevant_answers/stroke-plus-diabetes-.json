    "question": "Can anyone offer any advice or experience please? my Dad has managed t2 diabetes for many years though had a stroke last year that rendered him unable to swallow. He now uses a peg feed overnight with bolus feeds during the day. He manages tiny amounts of fluid and food (also chews and spits food so that he can still enjoy mealtimes with the family).It hasn't been easy and recently he's been losing weight, now into muscle weight loss. I understand the feed regime isn't really primarily designed for diabetes but is all we have. Has anyone else had experience of this and any positive news or advice please?Thanks.",
