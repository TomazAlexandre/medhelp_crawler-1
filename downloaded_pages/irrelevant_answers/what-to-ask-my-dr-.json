            "answer": "See how baby is first and foremost lol. Then see how much baby is weighing. They might want to run tests for your well-being. Make sure you need to go pee before going to doctor, they will more than likely want a urine sample to test sugars etc. You can ask if baby is head down, or in breech position. You may also be checked to see if you are dilated. It all depends on your doctor:)",

    "question": "Okay so due to some uncontrollable situations I haven't been seen at my OB CLINIC since May! I am due 18 September (37weeks along so far) I have no idea what I should be asking or what to expect at this appointment? This is my first child and as far as I can tell everything is normal. He moves a lot like he's supposed to I'm not feeling anything crazy. What kinds of things should I ask? Also what do I need for a hospital bag? How long will I be staying? Any other advice would be greatly appreciated thanks ladies :)",
