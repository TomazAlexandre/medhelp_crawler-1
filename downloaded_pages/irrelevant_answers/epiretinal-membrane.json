    "question": "To: Michael J Kutryb, MDI reached my retinologists' office today and the nurse said that it is not serious--only a trace.I later realized that I should have asked her if it made a difference that I am in the 10% who make too much scar tissue--I have had 5 retina surgeries in 9 months, and I have lost most of the vision in my left eye, due to scar tissue, including erm, and hypotony. I am now trying to save the eye itself. It looks as if the left eye not may have stopped manufacturing scar tissue.\u00a0\u00a0The problem started with a detached retina. The erm came later, with the other scar tissue, and as a result of the surgeries, I believe.I was really scared when I saw that the doctor had noted the erm od on Friday.He did not discuss it with me. However, it looks like it may never get worse, right, even though my body makes too much scar tissue?Of course, I must avoid any surgery in the right eye, even cataract surgery. I wish there were a med to prevent cataracts.",
