            "answer": "If she measured your belly that's not accurate at determining how big your baby is. My ob doesn't measure fundal height as he says its pointless. He gives ultrasounds every appt to check growth, etc. Even ultrasounds aren't accurate at determining weight. My son was supposedly five pounds ten ounces at 35w6d. I had him two days later and he was 6lbs 12oz.So try not to worry. It does sound like you need to try to find another dr or midwife. They can generally fax over your medical records to the new dr. It wouldn't hurt to see if you can find someone.",

This is my first pregnancy it should be a good experience and I should know more about what's going on.",

    "question": "I swear if I wasn't already 36 weeks I would switch doctor/midwifes I'm so upset my midwife knows nothing about me or my baby!!! My last appointment she forgot I had gestational diabetes btw I had already been diagnosed with it for almost 3 weeks!! Then this appointment she measures me and says I'm measuring 32 weeks the same as I was at my appointment two weeks ago and tells me that weird with me being diabetic.......ummm ya think I'm 36 weeks my baby is measuring 4 weeks behind!!!!!!! Well I had a ultrasound sound about 2 weeks ago so I ask her how it looked she forgot I had one and hadn't reviewed it yet she had no clue I have been having contractions at every non stress test and I know they tell her cause she tells them what to do when I'm having them which shows after 9 months this woman still has no clue who I am!!!! Really she's the person I'm relying on to help me get my baby here safe and she seems absolutely clueless about everything!! I honestly just want my daughter out I feel like she's no longer safe inside me she's measuring small and obviously not getting what she needs from me and the woman who is supposed to have the answers and help me understand seems at clueless as I am!! I dunno what to do anymore I just want to cry!!!",
