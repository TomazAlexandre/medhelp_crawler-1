            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am really sorry to hear about your husband and naturally you are concerned and scared. First of all immediately consult his cardiologist. Coreg should only be given to people who have no heart related problems. His heart function and other heart related tests should be carried out first. Fainting, light headedness and dizziness are common side effects. Also it should be taken with precaution in diabetes. However do not stop the drug on your own. The dose will have to be slowly tapered. The other possibility is that the sugar level is dipping low. What would be best is that he is re evaluated by both cardiologist and diabetologist at one go\u2014may be in a hospital setting. I understand he just came out, but maybe this exercise should be done again. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
