            "answer": "Hi Sag77, My comments are just patient to patient but might help you research a little.There are complications that can off-spring so-to-speak, from autoimmune thyroid disease (Hashimoto's). Diabetes is one of them but patients practically are never informed about this. Some of the diseases that can develop are \"Poloyglandular Autoimmune Diseases\". There are two types of these, one is a combo of Hashimoto's and Addison's (adrenal insufficiency) and they also refer to this one as \"Schmidt's Syndrome\" or \"PGA I\". The other is a combo of several diseases like Hashi's with diabetes, adrenal insufficiency and hypo-parathyroidism (parathyroid glands are not same as thyroid gland). The parathyroids mainly are for calcium regulation but can cause symptoms similar to hypothyroidism. So this other one, affecting several glands is \"PGA II\".Did they ever check you for \"Adrenal Insufficiency\"? I ask because the dizziness upon standing (Othostatic Hypotension) is a major symptom of low adrenal function, especially when you have it bad enough to actually pass out. They usually check your cortisol (cortical) levels and for adrenal antibodies, to rule out or diagnose it.JimLow",

            "answer": "Hi JimLow, I understand; any helpful info is appreciated. I've been trying to research, but seem to keep coming to Lupus or MS as posibility. I want to be more thorough and have more than those two options to look at and ask about. Maybe I'll find something that will set a light off for one of the docs. I was diagnosed with TypeII Diabetes 1yr after hypothyroid disorder nearly 10yrs ago. Then, put on Glucophage for it but it just aggrivated the seizure problems this year b/c it began causing my blood sugar levels to drop too low. My levels have been great and A1C is awesome so I'm just going by diet for that now.\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't informed about the Polyglandular Autoimmune Diseases. I had a complete thyroidectomy in 2000.\u00a0\u00a0During the surgery they found there was only 1 parathyroid where it was suppose to be, found 1 in a thyroid gland & 2 were missing.\u00a0\u00a0They placed the 1 found in my thryoid into muscle tissue hoping my body would take hold of it. I don't believe I've had any problem calcium levels. They do test them periodically. They never mentioned checking for Adrenal Insufficiency. I don't think my cortisol levels have been checked. I will check though. The cardiologist diagnosed me with the neurogenic syncopy based on tests they did. I did pass out on the tilt table test. Other tests: I've had elevated ANA levels. I had CRP levels at 6.42(norm 0-0.5). I will look over copies I have and ask as well regarding the tests you mentioned. I am being set up with a neurologist for a lumbar punture to test for MS, but still don't have a date on that. I don't have appt. with rheumotologist until middle of next year though. My PCP decided to start taking me off meds. to see what happens. He started with my Zanaflex and Provigil. Now my muscles are in even worse spasms. He wanted to take me off Topamax (for migranes), but I said no-can't handle tired, pain & more migranes. So, he upped the dose instead. I asked to be sent to Mayo Clinic so we can figure out what's going on and start doing something about it, but they want me to at least wait until I get in with more specialist...even though I'm not going to be able to get into see specialist until next year. I apologize, I'm just so frustrated and I don't know what to do anymore. Thank you for your time and help!! I just try to enjoy life as best I can now and look forward to a time when I will be able to do so better.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is quite an uplifting part of my life! She keeps me going and looking!",

            "answer": "I just did some reading on Addison's and I definately haven't been testing for cortisol levels by the process given for it. I have had low sodium levels periodcially. I just thought I would add that after my bit of reading. Also, I don't know why I didn't look before, but I saw on the Mayo Clinic's website that most patients call to make the appt. themselves. So, I may call and see what they say.",

    "question": "Diagnosed with hypothyroid nearly 10yrs ago and just diagnosed with Hashi's this year. I have had an onslaught of medical problems for the past year or so. Old problems were thyroid disorder, type II diabetes (they said probably caused by my thyroid disorder), migranes,etc. I was put on bedrest with my daughter during pregnancy due to early labor and delivered a month early in April 2004. Once I had her, I just seemed to get worse. I have extreme muscle pain all over my body every day. If I do anything more than watch her (go out, try to do any housework) I have extreme joint pain from my fingers to my toes. My migranes have worsened. I was diagnosed with neurogenic syncopy (passing out due to low blood pressure) and am treated for that. I have a slipped disk in my back & neck. I began having seizures at the beginning of this year-2005 and they worsened quickly. By March I was nearly in a semi-coma state. I don't remember much of that period of time. The seizures had gotten to be throughout every day and still no reason as to why I was having them. That's when they decided it was phychological. But, mental health said no. They didn't give me Glucophage because I got sick and I didn't have any seizures on the 3rd day after. So, we thought it had all been a reaction to the medication. However, when I began trying to do more once I felt fairly confident that was so, they began again. Although, now if I don't do anything other than what is necessary I don't have them. But, if I overexhaust myself I do. I'm always tired. My PCP keeps saying he doesn't know. Any ideas?!?!\u00a0\u00a0Help!",
