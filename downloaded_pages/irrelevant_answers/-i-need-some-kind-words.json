They will figure it out dear. Just hang in there. I would hope they keep.him to monitor him closely to see when and why it happens. Has he had health issues in the past?",

            "answer": "He got hit by a car last october and ever since then he's had this issue, but now it's increasing and happening more often. They just sent him for xrays and now they're waiting to do a CAT scan to check for swelling in his brain, but they also keep mentioning his digestive system so they really have no idea they're just testing everything. Thanks for the prayers, we sure could use all we can get. Hopefully they find something so we can at least get an answer, the waiting is the hardest part :(",

            "answer": "Thank you ladies, it seems we finally have some answers. We're still here and learning more every minute, they say it's called Pancreatitis, luckily it's only acute and no irreversible damage has been done but he's gonna be in the hospital for a couple days while they monitor him and he's not allowed to eat until the swelling goes down which they say can take a couple days so he's not a very happy camper about having to be iv fed and hydrated. We're still learning more about what exactly it is and what caused it but at least we have some\u00a0\u00a0answers now. Gonna be a long week for us. The hospital staff are sweet though they brought me this nice reclining chair that turns into a bed so I can stay with him, I dread having to go to work tomorrow but especially if he's not working I need to make some money.",

    "question": "My hubby is in the hospital for the second time in two weeks.. He was found unconscious on the side of the road\u00a0\u00a0this morning while on his way to work. They're running millions of tests and he's hooked up to so many machines. He's awake and talking and breathing but they still can't figure out what makes him randomly pass out. I'm so stressed out. I stayed up all night because every time he fell asleep he stopped breathing so I had to push him around and keep waking him up. He said he felt better and that's why he went to work so I finally fell asleep at 7 just to wake up at 9 and rush to the hospital. I can't take it. I'm having a major crisis of faith here. I just want to curl up in a ball and cry. My blood pressure is already high as it is and I'm so swollen I hurt but theres nothing I can do for any of us. I'm so lost.",
