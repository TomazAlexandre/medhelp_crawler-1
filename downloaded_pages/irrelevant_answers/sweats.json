            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The first thing to be ruled out is a hormonal imbalance due to menopause and hence please visit your gynecologist to get FSH, LH, estrogen and progesterone assessed. The second possibility is a thyroid disorder. Anemia, diabetes, overwork, stress and fatigue could be the other causes.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please consult your PCP.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
