            "answer": "I think end of the day there is a reason why they give us due date at 40 weeks... My boy came at 37 weeks and had some little problems and all the doctors saying is coz he was to early and he wasn't ready ( i had some complications and had to deliver him early) so i understand and agree but remember every baby is different so she/he will come when its ready and dnt stress mama your angel gonna be just fine xxx all the best x",

            "answer": "I agree, the longer they leave them in the better but if baby is ready theb baby is ready. My son was delivered at 35wks as I was high risk. He is beautiful and smart but he is about a month behind on reaching his milestones and drs say that's because of his 'age corrected' (he's now 13mths old but if he'd gone full term he'd only be 12mths). However in saying that, his peadiatrician is not concerned at all as long as he meets his milestones because babies have generally all caught up by the time they're 2yrs.",

    "question": "So I looked on Google & wanted to know why they changed the full term thing from 37 weeks to 39 weeks & CNN stated that doctors changed it because babies who are born at 39 weeks have better brain development, & are more healthier than babies born at 37 weeks. Crazy how 2 weeks can make a big difference right? I'm 18 years old & i'm 36w+5d & at High Risk with my first child & I feel that my baby will come before 39 weeks because my stomach has dropped so much & all the contractions & kicking I have. I just pray that he will be healthy if he comes before the 39 week mark....I pray that he comes into this world healthy period, but does anyone else feel like this?",
