            "answer": "I was going to ask if you wre on Meds I see you arent now but how long ago did you stop as they could have had side effects, perhaps some of your symptoms are caused by stress we can get physical symptoms aswell .Do you worry a lot, our thoughts are what effect us the most , if you can face a worry and think about it for a few mins then say stop , and let go, I know that sounds very simple but I have learned to be able to do that and visualisation had helped me also.It is impossible to experience a negative feeling without first creating a negative corresponding thought,our thinking will always create the reality we perceive.For instance when we are impatient we are thinking impatient thoughts,when we are stressed we are thinking stressful thoughts.We can recognise that the actual source of our experience is always our thinking.so it is our thought process that determines how we feel.",
