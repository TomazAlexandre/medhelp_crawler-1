            "answer": "I agree with the above poster. You shouldn't stop medication w/out first concultimg your doctor. Also,don't worry about possible fertility issues til the time comes. I found out I had PCOS after a year of TTC and I'm now on metformin and clomid. I have been responding well to the metformin and just started my first round of clomid. Hopefully I'll be preggers soon.",

    "question": "Hello,My name is Kaitlin and I turn 21 in October. I was diagnosed almost a year ago with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome after noticing hair growths, having irregular to no periods, sharp pelvic pains, sugar cravings, mood swings and more. However, after being diagnosed having insulin resistance, higher male hormones, and cysts, I was told that because I am 5 ft 5 in and 120 pounds that my only choice to keep my body working is Metformin. At the time, being emotionally stunned by the whole storm of news, I agreed and have been taking 2,000 mg of Metformin daily along with Genress Fe birth control. The birth control and Metformin have been working to keep me in balance, but the Metformin gets me sick on and off in not so tolerable ways. I never imagined at 20 I would have to deal with this and the thought of, potentially, having severe fertility issues from it when I do plan on a child is heart breaking.I just want to know, if it is possible to keep hormones and insulin in check with out all the medications/weightloss when you are not overweight?",
