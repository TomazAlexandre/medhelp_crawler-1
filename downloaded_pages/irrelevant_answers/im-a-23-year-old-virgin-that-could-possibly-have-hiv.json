    "question": "Basically, back in May on a college trip, a suitcase dropped on my toe and made it cut and bleed. There was even a cut on the bottom of the toe. Later on that night, my hotel roomate had her period and said she was soaking her vagina in the tub. I got into the shower after her to wash my bloody toe. (standing up and also, since there was a cut at the bottom and I was walking around that day, the wound had not heeled completely by the evening). The following day, she tells a group of us she has an autoimmune disease during a bonding session. I know that is different and could be fibroids or something but what if she was lying and has hiv?I've taken a blood test at my Dr's to check for diabetes and hypertension but I'm sure if I have hiv they\u00a0\u00a0will let me know. I've been waiting over a month for my test results and I'm extremely parnoid. I'm a Virgin and I don't use drugs. I don't even like to kiss. I feel really ******* stupid. I could have just not washed for the night. Ughhhhhhhh help me please.",
