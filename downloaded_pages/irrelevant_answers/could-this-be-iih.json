            "answer": "You have flags for diabetes, particuliarly the floaters. All of the rest are also sometimes connected with insulin utilization issues.So.....the next step is to get a full diabetic screen. This is not a \"single\" test. You need either a fasting glucose test or an insulkin clamp protocol.Your opthamologist should have suggested this.",

            "answer": "I believe you have \"visual snow\". It's rare so even the neuro-optomologists typically don't know what you're talking about, nor do any other doctors, including neurologists.You'll see that visual snow is usually accompanied with floaters.\u00a0\u00a0It is also commonly linked to retinal persistance and starbursting, as in my case. Mine started about 10 months ago.In my case, I think it is associated with other neurological issues, but visual snow hasn't necessarily been linked to other neurogic disorders. You can see my \"interests\" to see the other issues I have.A PCP should direct you to a neurologist to do a brain MRI, but the PCP will also run blood work.",

            "answer": "The glucose fasting test is the first thing to do. It might surprise you that insulin utilization probloems are often accompanied by shortness of breath. To use the sugar up in a deficiency of insulin the blood becomes acidic. This can trigger an asthmatic reaction in the lungs.The problem might well be neurological, however there is a decision tree involved here.Before heading toward an neurological etiology, you require a fasting glucose test.",

Ketoacidosis (I believe you were referring)\u00a0\u00a0is a true possibility, however most breathing difficulties seemed to be triggered by stress and where not an issue as I slept, only when I thought about the possibility of not being able to breathe or something along those lines. Wouldn't Ketoacidosis (if that was what I was experiencing) be a life threatening situation only remedied by insulin injection/ medications?",

            "answer": "It's important to differentiate whether the onset of floaters is well correlated to the timing of visual snow (mine was within few weeks and until then I never noticed any floaters) and also whether the floaters are relatively the same in both eyes (both in terms of onset and severity). In my case, it was, which cast doubt that there was a retinal problem, but rather something more systemic or coming upstream of the optic nerves.",

A little known fact is that something as simple as Tylenol over any period of time can cause vision trouble. It is not permanent and if you stop the medication chances are you will go back to normal. If you are taking any meds tell your Dr.",

I was referred to a specialist at the Eye Center of Texas. Again, perfect eyes, no problems. Since I have seemingly perfect vision, could the problem be neurological?I have gained a significant amount of weight and am obese, 22 yrs old, female,\u00a0\u00a0vision problems, headaches, wooshing noise in ears from time to time. Currently have no vision loss but do not want to wait until it developes.\u00a0\u00a0Do I go to my PCP or find a neurologist?",
