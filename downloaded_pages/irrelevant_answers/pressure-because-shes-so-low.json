    "question": "I'm 21w5d and at my ultrasound at 20w5d. They had to dig into my pelvic bones to find her head. She isn't moving from my lower abdomen. And the pressure I get is horrific. I feel like a body builder is inside of me pushing on my pelvic region and slowly tearing it apart. I have no pain just pressure. Horribly uncomfortable. The drs say there's nothing to worry about my cervix isn't opening and baby is right on track. I'm seeing a high risk Dr for\u00a0\u00a0my diabetes so he double and triple checks things.Is anyone's else's baby's really low and just not moving?",
