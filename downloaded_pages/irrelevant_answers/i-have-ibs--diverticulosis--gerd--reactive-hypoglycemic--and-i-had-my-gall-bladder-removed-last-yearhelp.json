            "answer": "I recommend getting your thyroid tested and maybe a blood test for pregnancy as well. Sometimes blood tests for pregnancy can pick up what a urine one can't. Also, make sure your doctor tests for the T3 &T4 and not just TSH which they will likely try to do.Are you unable to have fish? Depending on where you live there might be a cheap white fish available. Have you tried ground chicken? I find there are a lot more things I can do with it (and it's easier to hide the flavor) than with chicken breast. Game is also a theoretical possibility, but it's really expensive unless you know someone with a hunting license. (I find kangaroo MUCH easier to handle than chicken and more enjoyable than fish -which are the only 2 meats I can eat. Deer has some of the same qualities of Kangaroo which is why my thoughts went to game meats.)Have you been tested for celiac's? Even if you have and it turned no results you might consider going gluten free, you never know what might help your IBS. I read somewhere it takes 3 months for all the gluten toxins to get out of your body? Idk if that's true, but it's worth a shot if you're feeling crummy all the time.How have you tried to increase your fiber? Have you looked into slippery elm? Its a plant that grows in the states, and it was pretty cheap in Seattle to get the pills for so it might be worth looking into. Any supplement store and most health food stores should have it. There is also psyllium husk -but it's more expensive (It's native to India) and I haven't tried it yet so I can't personally recommend it but I've heard good things about it. Both of those are gluten free, which is why I suggested them. It's possible that in the past, when you upped your fiber you upped your gluten and pissed off your tummy.I hope some of that was helpful. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand that foods which are good for IBS are to be avoided for diabetes and vice versa. In addition low fat foods need to be accommodated. Exercise and food will reduce the weight overall. But reduction in specific areas needs 'focused' exercises or liposuction. Chart out life style measures which included regular exercise, specific diet schedules and stress reduction protocols.\u00a0\u00a0To begin with take smaller meals at shorter intervals.\u00a0\u00a0If constipation is the main symptom of your IBS then artificial sweeteners will help. Further complex carbohydrates and fiber will help both conditions. Aiming at this combination will involve 20-30 grams of fiber daily from whole grain breads; cereals and pasta; legumes (beans and peas); and fruits and vegetables. Eating plenty of fibrous vegetables will supplement the much needed vitamins and minerals; will help lose weight; and are recommended for IBS, diabetes and to lower cholesterol. I have not chartered out an exact plan for you have given suggestions hoping you benefit from them. A nutritionist can help chart out diet program for you.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I need serious help with my diet.\u00a0\u00a0It seems no matter what I eat it upsets my stomach.\u00a0\u00a0I probably have all possible symptoms all wrapped together...bloating, gas, constipation, diarrhea, acid reflux, occasional vomiting, nausea is more frequent.\u00a0\u00a0It is hard enough to control all my symptoms, but add my menstrual cycle into the picture and they spiral out of control.\u00a0\u00a0here recently my symptoms, along with my period, have been completely out of wack.\u00a0\u00a0It seems no matter what I do I can't keep my sugar under control...but in the past couple months my period has been right there with everything else, I have had 4 menstrual cycles in the past 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0My period has never been normal/regular, I skipped July and August (not unusual), Sept. cycle was a little light but nothing questionable, then 3wks later I started but only bled for a day or two, 2wks later yet again I started my period again.\u00a0\u00a0It lasted for 3 or 4 days, but was very light (only needed a panty liner), then to add to my discomfort yet another period came 2wks after that one.\u00a0\u00a0Since august I have gained aprox. 20lbs...I haven't had an increased appetite, its more like an uncontrollable need to eat; though I haven't been eating excessively, just a little bit more than normal.\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy has been a thought, but I have taken 3 home tests, all with negative results.\u00a0\u00a0 I have tried to increase my fiber intake, but it seems to just worsen my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I try to watch my fat intake, but with a limited budget its not that easy to follow....and i am sick of chicken ( the only thing that seems to be tolerable).\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions would be appreciated...my frustration level is not healthy, thank you for your help.",
