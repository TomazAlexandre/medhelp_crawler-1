            "answer": "A rule of thumb for tingling in the hands is that if the tingling is in the little, ring, or middle finger, then the problem relates to the neck.\u00a0\u00a0You can get some xrays of the neck to see if you have problems, if none are found, see a chiropractor for an adjustment.\u00a0\u00a0If the tingling is in the thumb and first finger, the problem is in the elbow.\u00a0\u00a0If the entire, but single hand is tingling, have a nerve conduction study done to see if a nerve may be pinched,inflammed, or carpal tunnel may be present.\u00a0\u00a0If both hands tingle, then have the Thyroid checked, including an ultrasound, for function and cysts. If your primary care physician isn't sure what is the problem, have them refer you to an orthopedist (preferable one who specializes in hands) for diagnoses and treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

I actuall tie them down now. See my post and the doctor's answer under PAD - peripheral arterial disease.",
