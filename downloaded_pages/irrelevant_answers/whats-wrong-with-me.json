            "answer": "It could be your blood sugar or a panic attack. But also do you feel like you know what is going on when it happens and are aware of where you are? or Do you feel like panic and feel like you are going to die or a bad feeling? If you start to shake and blank out and don't know what happened and someone tells you that you were shaking you could have had a seizure. If this is the case then see a neurologist. They can do an exam on you and maybe do an electroencephalogram or (EEG) to confirm it. If you feel panicked and feel like bad things are going to happen or that you might die or that kind of thing and are shaking it may be a panic attack. In which case they can do biofeedback or medication or maybe even counseling.",
