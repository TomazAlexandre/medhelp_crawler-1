            "answer": "In addition to the above suggestions I would also suggest a diet with a very high fibre content - such as pulverised fresh fruit and also pulverised fresh vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Some bran can also be added to these mixtures.\u00a0\u00a0The aim of this is to lessen the transit time of digestion (i.e. the time from swallowing to the time of defacation) which in turn reduces the time that any toxins generated in digestion are in contact with the intestines.\u00a0\u00a0For example, in countries with high fibre diets, colon cancer is practically unknown.In view of a male family history of colon cancer, I would suggest consulting a G.I. specialist and asking whether it might be a good idea for you to undergo a colonoscopy every ??? (5??) years.regardsMorecambe",

            "answer": "I thing the diet and screening advice from Morcambe is excellent.\u00a0\u00a0As far as colonoscopy, I'm a colorectal cancer survivor, with a family history - I'm the fourth generation.\u00a0\u00a0One thing I've learned is that if you have a first-degree relative with colon cancer (e.g. parent, sibling) you should begin having screening colonoscopy at an age 10 years younger than that relative was when diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0For example, my dad was diagnosed at 50 (unfortunately he was diagnosed post mortem) so I should have had a colonoscopy at 40.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't know this and had my first one at 46 because I had symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0By then I had stage 3 cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Check your family history and ask your doctor when you should be screened.",
