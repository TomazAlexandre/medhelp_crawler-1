            "answer": "Hello SaturnStroll,NOne of us here is a physician, but we're pretty experienced and knowledgeable about this disease.Many overweight folks who develop diabetes have Type 2, but you haven't mentioned whether you have Type 2 or Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know which type you have?Folks with Type 2 who return to a healthy weight can often stop taking meds and can control their diabetes with exercise and a sensible diet.\u00a0\u00a0Technically, however, I don't think they are cured because if they drop their good self-care, their symptoms (and potential risks for other nasty complications) will all return).Folks with Type 1 diabetes who may be overweight, can often lower their dosage of insulin, but will not be able to stop taking insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Folks with Type 1 (also called Juvenile Diabetes even tho' many of us are adults now!) lose the ability to produce insulin and thus, even with weight loss, we must continue to take insulin.Do you have a team to help you?\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss is tough.\u00a0\u00a0The frightening diagnosis of diabetes can get folks started, and yet it often takes a good strong will AND a helpful team of family, certified diabetes educator, diabetogist/endocrinologist to help a newly diagnosed diabetic develop good new habits to replace the comfy ones that must be tossed aside.Please check in again and share a bit more about the \"type\" you are.\u00a0\u00a0That way we can point you to some additional good resources.",

            "answer": "The stark reality is - once you have Diabetes (either Type 1 or Type 2) you have it for life.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike illnesses like Cancer, which can go into indefinite remission, Diabetes doesn't go away.\u00a0\u00a0There are no cures or fixes - just ways to \"manage\" it.Diabetes is not a disease that comes and goes away in time - it is the \"end result\" of something that has happened to your body that A) destroyed the cells in your pancreas that produce insulin, or B) caused your cells to become insulin resistant, or C) a combination of both A and B.As stated above - if you are Type 2 Diabetic (most overweight Diabetics are) - you take insulin sensitizer pills that make your cells receptive to insulin.\u00a0\u00a0With the proper carefully controlled diet - you can control your sugar levels and reduce the number of pills you have to take.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 Diabetics usually have a functioning pancreas.If you are Type 1 - your pancreas no longer will produce insulin and you need to inject insulin in order to control sugar levels even if you properly diet.\u00a0\u00a0With Type 1 - there is no feasible way around giving yourself insulin shots. \"Insulin pills\" do not exist, neither does an \"insulin patch\" - although there is research into these insulin delivery methods.",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with diabetes two years ago when I went for my annual physical, my sugar reading was 210. My Doctor then, placed me on Advandamet, and I began losing over 40 pounds from worrying after reading all the horible things biabetes does to you. I didn't want to be in that category or ready to die this early in my life. I lost the weight and sugar levels were back to normal, My new Doctor took me off the medication and for over a year I kept the weight off and sugar seemed fine. I began to believe that weight loss had nothing to do with it so I began eating back like I used to, you know the \"comfort foods\" well I gained 30 pounds and recently my employer had us have a blood test done. Guess what? yep sugar level 180...tryglicerides 210 they obvious go hand in hand with one another. I remember when I saw a nutrienist she told me I could beat the diabetes type 2 by excercise and diet but she said this will have to be a life change and not just a diet. She explained that diets are short term life style changes are a lifetime. Well for me, I am going back to no firied foods, no sugar, and alot of salads, chicken,seafood, and lean beef.....and back to the gym!!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0 My sugar was not as high as it was when intially diagnosed 2 years ago so that is encouraging...........i will report my results I am 224 pounds now with a goal of 180lbs and then another blood test. Don't give up.....make that life style change, I will say it is hard and don't do what I did after you lose it,,,,,,keep it off.",

            "answer": "SadieThis thread has gotten a bit confusing because people are talking about both Type 1 and Type 2 which are very different types of diabetes. For Type 1 diabetes you need to take insulin to manage your blood sugar, and you will always have to do so. But if you take the right doses and test your blood sugar and eat a good diet, you won't have complications. If you are young, you can hope that in the future they will develop a cure.By the way, Type 1 is no longer called Juvenile Diabetes but simply Type 1. Besides the fact that young people grow up, the medical profession is recognizing more and more people as developing Type 1 later in life. I was diagnosed at age 58. I may act juvenile at times, but chronologically...not so much!",

            "answer": "Is he diagnosed as pre-diabetic Nikki, or are you just concerned about the way he doesn't take care of himself in general. Not everyone who eats poorly or is overweight gets diabetes. However if he is pre-diabetic he will definitely develop diabetes and diabetic complications if he doesn't make changes in his lifestyle. Diabetic complications are not pretty and include blindness, amputations and kidney failure.As for what you can do about it, that's another question. It's really hard to convince someone of something when they are in denial and being defensive. All you can do is express your caring and concern. You can download useful information and leave it around. Diabetes is a disease that can be managed, but if ignored it will only get worse. If you are too bothered by his behavior and leave him that is your choice. It's very frustrating!",
