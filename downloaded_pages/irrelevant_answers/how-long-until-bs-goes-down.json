            "answer": "\"what sort of time range am i looking at , before it goes back down to normal\"That's hard to say. First, let's discuss your posted levels. Where these prandial [before meal] or postprandial [2-3 hours after a meal]? When your prandial levels reach 10 mmol/l you have entered the danger zone, diabetes side effects begin to destroy your body. Postprandial goal is <7.8 mmol/l, optimum is <6.8 mmol/l.Do not rely on medication alone to resolve your problem, it won't. You need to make lifestyle changes along with taking Metformin to help lower your levels. I suggest you read other threads on this forum as lifestyle suggestions have been posted often. Also, Google search diabetes and educate yourself on this disease. The more you understand it the easier it is to handle. Good luck.",
