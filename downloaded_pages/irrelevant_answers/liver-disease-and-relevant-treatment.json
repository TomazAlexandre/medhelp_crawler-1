    "question": "I am a 45 year old overweight woman with hypo thyroidism (diagnosed 11 years ago), asthma (diagnosed 20 years ago), and have had a spleenectomy (30 years ago).\u00a0\u00a0A year ago I was diagnosed with hypertension and prescribed blood pressure medication and while my blood sugars were on the high side, I did not have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, I had my gall bladder removed and the surgeon indicated he saw severe cirrosis of the liver and took 5 samples of for pathological testing.\u00a0\u00a0The report stated that the samples were benign so my family physician felt perhaps the surgeon saw more of a fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0However, since then I have had increasing ascites in the abdominal area and my liver enzymes are still on the rise while my protein levels are low (although I am a vegetarian) and my iron levels are low.\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for hepatits and all have come back negative.\u00a0\u00a0If I had severe cirrosis of the liver, would this not have been revealed through the biopsies?\u00a0\u00a0Is there something I can do to relieve the ascites?\u00a0\u00a0What course of action should I take next?Thank you so much for your help.Deborah",
