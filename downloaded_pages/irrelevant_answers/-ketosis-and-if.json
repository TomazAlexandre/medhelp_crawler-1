            "answer": "Hi,there is a thing called the Dawn Phenomenon.\u00a0\u00a0basically this describes the observation by many people with diabetes that their fasting\u00a0\u00a0blood sugars may be high in the mornings.\u00a0\u00a0This is believed due to the liver dumping glucose to the blood stream in response to the fasting, and the pancreas not being able to put out enough insulin to counter this and bring the blood sugar down.As diabetes86 says you can have metabolic ketosis even with higher than normal blood sugars.How low is your low carb?\u00a0\u00a0What is your Hba1c?\u00a0\u00a0What are your post meal numbers @ 1.5 - 2 hours after eating?If diet and exercise can't bring your fasting down to normal (Btw. a fasting of 125 would already get you a diagnosis of diabetes), then you would need to add medications.\u00a0\u00a0A common starter medication is metformin/ Glucophage, which is an insulin sensitizer that helps your body respond better to the insulin it produces.",

            "answer": "I made an appt with my provider tomorrow morning for an official A1C. During my telephone consult, my doc told me that I had a previous A1C at 6.0 and my concern is that I've gotten much worse. I've been prediabetic for some time now and never kept a close eye on my blood glucose until recently. My carbs are usually under 20g but I may reach up to 30g,at times.My ketostix are purple and I started testing my ketones (which is costly) just to see what I have been doing wrong bc I am not losing.After a meal, about a good hour, I will be a bit lower than the fast at around 98-115.I am all for getting this under control ASAP and thanks for responding.",

Baked chicken, sauteed mushrooms, roasted cauliflower, and a salad. Very little carbs minus the mushrooms I just plugged into mfp.Still, my numbers are as if I had binged on some cake and ice cream!",

            "answer": "Hi YunaYour previous hba1c of 6 will give you an average blood sugar of about 130.\u00a0\u00a0This is definitely higher than idea.You are already eating very low carb, and I don't think you can reduce your carbs further if you are only eating 20 - 30 g/day.Imagine how high your sugars would be going if you were eating carbs!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I think eating less than 20 g of carbs / day is not idea, as it means that you can also eat hardly any vegetables (and non-starchy vegetables are good for health).Does your dr understand how low carb you are eating?\u00a0\u00a0How high do you go if you do eat more carbs?I think you should ask your doctor to do a glucose tolerance test.\u00a0\u00a0That should clearly demonstrate that you have a problem, will hopefully get you a diagnosis, and should get you some treatment.At this point, it is possibly time to add in medication.How is your weight?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any family history of diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0How old are you?\u00a0\u00a0What is your activity level?\u00a0\u00a0I am asking these questions, because I want to see whether you most likely have type 2 diabetes, or whether you could possibly have type 1 (adult onset), and in which case it would be great if your Dr would order antibody tests for you.\u00a0\u00a0If you do indeed have adult onset type 1, usually slower to develop than type 1 with kids, then insulin (probably low dose), is now recognized as the optimal approach.\u00a0\u00a0Some centres also start all type 2 people on insulin earlier than later (to help\u00a0\u00a0maintain pancreas function by having normal blood sugars).Hope this helps.",

I used to be an avid runner some years ago and can still jog about 3 miles before taking a break. Mind you, it's a super slow pace though.

            "answer": "Hi Yuna,sounds like you have some serious insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0it would probably be recommended that you start a medication such as metformin which helps your body respond better to insulin.Don't worry about a minor slip up.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you are eating plenty of non-starchy vegetables as these are important for good nutrion even while eating low carb.\u00a0\u00a0Suspect you will still need to control your portion size while on low carb. Be persistent, and patient.\u00a0\u00a0For some people losing weight is tremendously hard.Further, would recommend you get your thyroid checked.\u00a0\u00a0Low thyroid can also contribute to very hard weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0For thyroid you should have the following tests as a starting point.\u00a0\u00a0FT3 and FT4.\u00a0\u00a0These results should be at least middle of the range (or a bit higher), TSH.\u00a0\u00a0This should be ideally in the range of 1 -2.\u00a0\u00a0Top of given range is also not ok.\u00a0\u00a0If your Dr refuses to do all these tests, at least start with TSH and FT4.With the abdominal fat, please also see if your dr is prepared to test you for adrenal function.\u00a0\u00a0If he won't at least proceed with the thyroid tests.\u00a0\u00a0You could also push for referral to an endocrinologist (you should probably be properly tested now for diabetes, thyroid and adrenals).\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully is only diabetes. :)Hope this helps.",
