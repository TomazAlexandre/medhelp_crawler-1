            "answer": "What is his blood sugar when he experiences these \"symptoms\"? This isn't exactly sounding like hypoglycemia, but it could be (low blood sugar) and a simple meter test will tell you. Or else he is drinking when you are at work and using diabetes as an excuse.",

            "answer": "I would take him to the hospital or the doctor and explain the symptoms you have been noticing in your husband. Only with proper bloodwork can the doctor assess the true nature of his problem. And performing an exam will give the doctor much needed information on what tests to run. I hope he feels better.",

            "answer": "I experience drunken like behavior when I am hypoglycemic and having problems with frequent low sugars. Make sure he tests his sugars at least 4 times a day and when he experiences symptoms. Have him eat protein with his carbohydrates so that he does not have abrupt drops in glucose levels. Tell him if he wants to prevent lows to cut out the alcohol. Alcohol can cause or impair someone's ability to realize that they are going low. Hypoglycemic unawareness is common for some diabetics who have had the disease for a long period of time. They may become giddy and drunken in appearance and not feel hypoglycemic when this state of giddiness IS their symptom of hypoglycemia.I am on an insulin pump with a continuous glucose monitoring device. If it weren't for the CGMD I would be stumbling around drunken in appearance like your husband and going into insulin shock very often.",

    "question": "My husband has type 2 but at the moment tries to control his diet and is not on any medication.\u00a0\u00a0However, he does like to have a drink at weekends.Most days he is normal and okay but occasionally he gets drunk like symptoms where his speech is slurred, his eyes are half shut and he cannot walk properly, he loses co ordination and he looks & behaves drunk. I have been accusing him of drinking whilst I have been at work, but I dont think this is the case.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be to do with his diabetes and he may need to start some medication.thank you if you can help with any answers to this.
