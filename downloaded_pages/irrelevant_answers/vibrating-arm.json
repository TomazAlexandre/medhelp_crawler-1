            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Ronnie, please talk to your elders regarding this. Your symptoms could be due to problems in the wrist referred to as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The nerve innervating (supplying) the thumb, the index finger and the middle fingers is the median nerve. This can get compressed in the wrist, leading to numbness of these areas leading to a condition called Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The nerve can get compressed due to obesity, Diabetes Mellitus, hypothyroidism, arthritis and trauma. If your symptoms persist, would advise you to consult your primary care physician who may do a neurological assessment and may ask for Nerve conduction Studies to detect lesions in the nerves.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
