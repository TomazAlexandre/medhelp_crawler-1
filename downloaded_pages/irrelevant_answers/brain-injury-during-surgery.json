            "answer": "Those are some very technical and very specific medical questions that nobody on this board are qualified to answer. You could see if there is a forum with a doctor responding more on the topic of brain injury.As for your hunger, inability to lose weight and pre-diabetes. First I would make sure your thyroid is ok, as that could make it impossible to lose weight. Then I would read up on pre-diabetes and weight loss as it is important to lose weight and alter your diet to slow the progression of diabetes. Send me a PM if you want the name of a website with pre-diabetics and diabetics and a forum on diet.",

            "answer": "Hi,I understand that traumatic brain injuries can cause what you are describing.\u00a0\u00a0 I read something recently that in some cases this is a problem with how the patient's body responds to insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment was actually medication tolower insulin levels.\u00a0\u00a0But this can also be done with a low carb diet, combined particularly with avoiding high fructose corn syrup.You need to see a neuro-endocrinologist, which is the type of doctor that could deal with\u00a0\u00a0your sort of case.Yes, I agree with Zoelula that you should have thyroid well checked, as this can contribute.\u00a0\u00a0And the site that she's direct you to is excellent, and well worth a look.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your responses as this gives me the confidence to ask these questions of the competent doctors responsible for my care now.\u00a0\u00a0My fear was that since I am not a doctor or a nurse or anyone else with the credentials who should know this information, I wouldn't be taken seriously like when I tried to get someone to listen to me about the severe headaches that I was having prior to my surgeries.\u00a0\u00a0If there is anything that will turn someone into a hypochondriac, it's chronic neglect and misdiagnosis.I have an incomplete educational background in the healthcare field, but not higher level professional experience.\u00a0\u00a0Most of what I am able to learn about my situation and how I am affected, I get from reading books and information on credible university or medical center sites",

            "answer": "Hi Maggie,It is hard to get medical profession to listen sometimes and not to be passed off as complaining unreasonably, being a hyperchondriac etc.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Problem I guess is that some doctors get jaded and lose sight of indivual patients.If you like I'll try to refind you the link (it was a podcast) talking about brain injury and the effect on weight.Don't give up.\u00a0\u00a0If you know something is wrong, likely you are right.I found that out when I had chronic appendicitis while pregnant with my daughter (and it took many doctors and much suffering and three months) before I was taken seriously and had surgery.......Let us know how you go.",

    "question": "I would like to know if an injury that happeed during brain surgery in which a general surgeon assisting my neurosurgeon retracted too forcefully caused an injury which left me with a left sided hemiparesis, 1.5 years of LT/ST memory loss and a seizure disorder, is actually a traumatic brain injury.Also, could this be the cause of my insatiable hunger, inability to lose weight, and pre-diabetes given its proximity to the hypothalamus?I'm told that I had a hemorrhagic stroke or two.\u00a0\u00a0Inaddition, because of the length of time that the cyst was misdiagnosed/undiagnosed, it completely occluded the pathway for CSF to flow and communication between the ventricles could not be re-established.\u00a0\u00a0In that regard, I needed to have bilateral VP shunts placed, replaced, and revised several times.\u00a0\u00a0I had around a dozen surgeries in the span of 7 ot 8 months, I'm told.\u00a0\u00a0As with before my colloid cyst diagnosis, No one seems to be taking me seriously.Thank you",
