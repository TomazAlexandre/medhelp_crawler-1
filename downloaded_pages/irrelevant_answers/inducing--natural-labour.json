            "answer": "It's hard to say, i doubt anything would work for you naturally yet as you're not quite term yet. I was induced at 38 weeks for my last one, and i wasn't even dilated at all, and my cervix was still tightly closed and high up. I needed the gel to bring on the contractions, and my labour lasted 5 & a half hours. Do you know if you're dilated at all yet?",

Raspberry leaf tea and primrose oil helps labor but it wont start it.. try LOTS of sex. But if you haven't had any labor symptoms its probably not going to happen. Why you getting induced?",
