            "answer": "I don't remember when it's done but it's a test to check for gestational diabetes. Just because you have never had diabetes before doesn't mean you can't be at risk during your pregnancy or from one pregnancy to the next for that matter. Simple test really. They make you chug a super sugary drink and after so long they draw blood to check your levels. I would guess they'll do it at your next appointment. They normally tell you ahead of time so you don't eat or drink anything overly sugary (like pop or candy and such) because that will mess with the results.",
