            "answer": "Weight loss as well as oily stools can be caused by various malabsorption syndromes, inflammatory bowel disease, or chronic pancreatitis.Sending the stool off for analysis and culture can be considered, as well as a lower endoscopy to look for malabsorption or IBD.\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests can be considered to evaluate the pancreatic enzymes (as well as possibly imaging the pancreas), as well as antibodies looking for celiac disease.These options should be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "I noticed quite some time ago (6 months or so) that along with my bowel movements there seemed to be an oil or grease slick on the water in the bowl.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't think much of it at the time.\u00a0\u00a0However yesterday I had BM that was very pale in color, today I had some diareah, however i did have 5 or 6 cocktails last night with O.J. and all i had to eat was 3 chicken wraps with apple celery and raw spinach, so the diareah was not much of a concern and not pale.\u00a0\u00a0I only am now getting concerned as I have been on the internet looking for this and what i find does not describe what i am seeing except for some weight loss, which i have attributed to cutting way back on my drinking and calorie intake (last night was the most i have had to drink in a few months).\u00a0\u00a0The oil is not in the stool nor do i see any mucous or if their is it is not readily evident.\u00a0\u00a0The lightness of yesterdays really threw me for a loop as i have never seen anything of that sort before.\u00a0\u00a0I did have unsafe hetersexual intercourse with a stranger 9 weeks ago (i am male), hiv test at 9 weeks is negative, which dr. hhh tells me is golden.\u00a0\u00a0I really don't have any other \"symptoms\" other than the fact that i constantly deal with postnasal drip and phlegm, which has always been there.I guess my question is this, should the oil (looks like someone put a small amount of vegetable oil in water) i see be causing me concern?",
