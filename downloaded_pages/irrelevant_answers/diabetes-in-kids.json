            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A normal, healthy blood sugar range is between 80 and 120, so a 96 is likely just fine.\u00a0\u00a0You could verify that with a check prior to eating breakfast in the morning, as well as a check 2 hours after a regular meal.\u00a0\u00a0Now just because the top end of the range is 120, sometimes healthy people's blood sugars fall outside that range, but it will always go back to normal ranges.Being 9 and 100 pounds isn't necessarily a bad thing, depending on his height.\u00a0\u00a0His doctor can do a Body Mass Index calculation with him to see if he is overweight.\u00a0\u00a0With the way you describe his lifestyle, I'd be more concerned about him developing type 2 diabetes than anything.\u00a0\u00a0A visit to the doctor will help understand the medical issues, but it is up to the parents to change habits.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "My grandson is 9 he weighs 100 lbs. He is sedentary, plays computer and video games all the time. I checked his blood sugar, it was 96 in the morning. I am concerned as he CRAVES sweets, is always hungry and when he uriniates it looks like the foam on a head of beer. Do I ask his doctor to investigate or am I being too cautious??",
