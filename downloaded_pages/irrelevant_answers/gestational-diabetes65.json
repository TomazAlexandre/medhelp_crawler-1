    "question": "So I have gestational diabetes and it gets pretty bad sometimes and I'm already on medicine for it.. well I'm supposed to keep track of my blood sugar four time a day and I haven't been able to since last Friday which is not good... I haven't been able to because I ran out of test strips for my blood sugar meter and I am absolutely broke and have no way to get any so I have no clue when the next time I can test my blood sugar will be. You would think if the Dr tells you that you need to keep track of it and everything they help supply the test strips but no... and they are so expensive too.. idk what to do :/",
