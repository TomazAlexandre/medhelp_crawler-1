My readings in the morning are usually 170 or a little higher, after a nice breakfast and lunch, I take my readings before dinner and they are at 130. My doctor says that for my height and weight 150 is ok. Every doctor you talk to will have the own opinions as I see it. Who knows anymore, everyone has their own thoughts and views.",

    "question": "Hi,My friend was over stressed before a month, i should say exactly a month before. His sugar level went\u00a0\u00a0up to 230. Now one month has passed and his stress level has come down... however, his sugar reading in this month varies like 172 , 160, 152.. all below 140... I have heard the normal level is below 140 for diabetes... but his latest reading is 152.His diet under control, exercising is regular ...Is it something normal?is everything fine , from working of pancreas, producing insulin level etc... or Is there anything to worry about or should i take it causally....What i feared was if the capacity of producing insulin level has reduced than before for him or something? or is it jus fine and will come back in normal soon and can maintain it consistently? plz help! im worried!",
