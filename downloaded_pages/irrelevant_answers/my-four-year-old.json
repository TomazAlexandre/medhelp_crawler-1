            "answer": "HiI am really sorry to hear about your daughter. From your post I think I feel that her diabetes is not under control. She also has accompanying seizures and probably a urinary tract infection which is common in a person with diabetes. EEG and urine examination is normal? I am not sure where exactly you stay but I am giving you an address along with mail id and website of a non profit organization dealing with such complications of diabetes. In a 4 year old child it is really difficult to comment without examining and seeing all the reports.Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, International120 Wall StreetNew York,\u00a0\u00a0NY\u00a0\u00a010005-4001Tel: 800-533-CURE (-2873) 212-785-9500Fax: 212-795-9595EMail: ***@****http://www.jdrf.orgPlease let me know if there is anything else.

    "question": "My 4 yr old daughter had never been sick (not even an ear infection), in nov she was diagnosed type-1 diabetic. March she got a weird voice \"wobble\", in april she had a seizure and was put on depekote but quickly switched to trileptal.In may her face started twitching and now the entire right side twitches. Has weight-loss (continuing) unable to urinate (has sensation of needing to pee but sits on toilet and cant go) doesn't have bowel movements without miralax and no energy since sept. Have been to stanford and multiple specialists all test come back normal. Any ideas??? There is no history of any thing including diabetes on either side of our family.",
