            "answer": "Hi, how are doing these days, hope your sleep has improved, have you seen any specialist for an advise. Do morning evening walk, stretches, have nutritious diet with lot of water or other liquids, have hot shower and listen to soft music before going to bed, these can be soothing to mind and body so it may be of some help. Few sessions of massage therapy can be beneficial. Mild dose of alprax also can be tried. Keep updating of any visit to neurophysician or sleep specialist. Take care.",

    "question": "Aged 50. Have never needed more than 7 hours sleep, in fact once per week I would happily stay up until 2 in the morning with no ill effects. Until very recently Go to bed about 11:00 and sleep for about 1 hour. Wkae up thirsty. Just sitting up and drinking juice then going back under covers and I start to shiver as if freezing cold. Started wearing PJs and drinking more juice before going to bed. Not thirsty but still wake up. If I don't move I still can't sleep. Eventually (say after 3 hours) end up visiting the toilet and the shivers and freexing cold occur again. Problem is I usually get back to sleep about 5 and find that at 7 when I awake again, I have sweated profusley from every pore - the skin on my hand looks like I have been in a bath for an hour. Any ideas? The washing machine must hate me!",
