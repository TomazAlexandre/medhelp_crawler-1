            "answer": "Cinnabon,I like the multiple meals per day approach, too and find that eating a modest amount more times a day keeps me from ever feeling completely famished.I was intrigued by the protein shake and wanted to know how many gms of \"sugar alcohols\" are in it.\u00a0\u00a0With the Atkins craze these days, I've seen a lot of products that are very low carbo ... until I read the fine print ... and discover that there may be 15 or more grams of sugar alcohols.\u00a0\u00a0Food labelling allows companies to subtract not only fiber grams but also sugar alcohol grams as they computer \"Net\" or \"Impact\" carb content.While all sugar alcohols are not equal from the point of view of BG impact, my nutritionist suggested that I \"count\" 1/2 the grams of sugar alcohol to estimate the BG impact and/or insulin/ exercise requirement.\u00a0\u00a0That seems to work pretty well for me.\u00a0\u00a0For example, one of my favorite treats, for example, is a low carb ice cream bar.\u00a0\u00a0The label proudly announces \"<3 grams of carb.\" The nutrition label says:Total carb = 9Fiber <1Sugar alcohol = 6Net Carb = 3I bolus for the 3 \"net carb\" and another 3 (for 1/2 of 6 sugar alcohol grams) = my total of 6grams.\u00a0\u00a0In this example, the difference between the \"net\" and \"my net\" is tiny.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the wonderful looking treats, tho', have 15, 20 or more grams of sugar alcohols.What's been your experience?",

            "answer": "Your diet actually looks very good.\u00a0\u00a0The only change I might recommend is to ADD a protein, perhaps an EggBeater omelet or cottage cheese in the morning, and increase your Am milk to 1/2-1 cup.\u00a0\u00a0Your current breakfast doesn't have much protein.You might try 1 cup of raw veggies with your lunch, or a salad made with plenty of veggies included.\u00a0\u00a0I'd actually eat a larger salad at night (1 cup is an AWFULLY small salad).Otherwise, you look pretty darn good.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been losing, and this is simply a stall, or are you just beginning?\u00a0\u00a0Any \"nibbles\" from other foods? Sometimes a bite of a cookie here, some extra cheese, and a brownie there can add up to hundreds of extra calories taken in unknowingly.\u00a0\u00a0But you sound pretty savvy with your diet!If you are working out strenuously and frequently, you need to be sure you are eating ENOUGH.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat too little, your body will actually lower its metabolic rate and become very efficient at storing what little you take in, despite the exercise and sometimes because of it.I've had some of my exercise partners break a stall by actually eating a bit more protein, and slightly decreasing the intensity/frequency of their work out routine.\u00a0\u00a0If you have been following yours for a while, try either scaling back slightly or changing what you do.Good luck to you.",

            "answer": "Well, as I calculate it, without your two protien shakes, you are taking in about 960 calories. Women need a minimum of 1300 calories a day to ensure they don't lower their metabolism. Lower metabolism = weight gain. As long as your protien shakes are at least 440 calories, your food intake should be adequate.That takes care of the food issue. Have you changed up your fitness routine lately? In order to lose the weight, you've got to keep challenging your body by increasing the frequency, intensity and time of your workouts every 4-6 weeks.If you continue to do these two things, I say just stick with it and you will eventually start to see a change. Good luck.",

            "answer": "I have been following a low starch/no processed-food eating plan for 4 months and have lost 30 lbs. I have been a Type 1 diabetic for 32 years and haven't found anything that works for me until now. I have cut out bread, pasta, rice, potatoes (white or sweet), corn and sweets. It doesn't matter how \"good\" the carbs are supposed to be, they still increase your need for more insulin, and over time, this can lead to insulin resistance. I am on an insulin pump and have cut my insulin requirements in half. So basically, I am eating lean protein, roasted soy nuts, nuts sparingly, cottage cheese (almost pure protein) veggies, fruits, and sugar free items with splenda in them. I feel amazing and am so much more energetic. I can keep up with my kids and then some. It may seem drastic to some, but once you cut out the starches, your blood sugars level out, and you don't crave them. Of course, you have to monitor your blood sugars very closely to make sure you don't go too low. The clean fuel I am now eating also helps me burn my food more effeciently, especially if I do eat starches once in awhile. This eating plan is easy if you have kids or other family members who don't want to give up the starches. You make the same meal for everyone, but don't eat the starches yourself. And of course, something like FiberChoice helps with regularity. I was scared to try this at first, but once I did, I was convinced. I will never say \"never\", but I don't plan on ever going back to my old eating habits.",

            "answer": "Protein shakes can actually add weight to you. As can eating so soon before bed. Your body starts slowing down and preparing for sleep around 7p.m. Also all carbs, complex or simple, can add weight to those with a damaged metabolism such as diabetics. Add more raw vegetables as those will keep your metabolism working. Drink plenty of water to flush your system. Add solid protein (meat) to your dinner. Every morning, drink a glass (8 fl oz) of warm water with juice from half a lemon.Note: Products that say \"low fat\" have higher sugar contents to make up for the lack of flavor.",
