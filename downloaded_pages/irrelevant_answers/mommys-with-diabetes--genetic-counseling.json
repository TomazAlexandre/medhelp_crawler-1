            "answer": "You had diabetes before you got pregnant? How far along are you now?I have gestational diabetes and I get checked every 2 weeks too. Doctor does ultrasound and checks baby's weight and measurements, and she also checks amniotic fluid: too little o too much is not good ;) Also, if baby starts getting too big they'll probably set you up for an induction at 38 week tops.How are you keeping your sugar under control? Do you take insulin shots or are you just dieting?I'm under a strict diet, low carb, low sugar. I keep losing weight even at week 34! If you are on a diet, your doc will also want to now if your baby is not growing as expected. In which case, he would probably give you insulin and make you eat more.",

I use diet and medformin to control my sugar no\u00a0\u00a0although its been hard with all the morning sickness and loss of appetite I've been having.

        {
            "answer": "Not genetic counseling as such... I do go to a specialist who keeps track of glucose levels in blood (I take 6 tests a day, before and after breakfast, lunch and dinner), weight.. But since diet is working for me, she doesn't do much besides checking those levels... Sorry I can't be of much help. Next time you visit don't you ask? I know it's hard waiting",

        {
            "answer": "I do the same thing as well with the specialist, check my sugar levels and such. So that means that its something else i guess. I'm definitely gonna ask in my next visit to my doctors. Thank you so so much!! This really helps. Good luck to you with your pregnancy.",

    "question": "My ob/gyn send me to a genetic counselor and I don't know if its because of the diabetes or not. I was wondering if any of the mommy's are going through the same thing. I'm seeing a specialist for my diabetes and getting monitoring every two weeks to see how baby is doing and the specialist tells me everything is okay so far with my baby. Before finding out I was pregnant my primary doctor prescribed me medicine I wasn't suppose to be taking that could of affected the baby so that could be another reaso . Just want to make sure with anyone else if maybe anyone is going through the same thing.",
