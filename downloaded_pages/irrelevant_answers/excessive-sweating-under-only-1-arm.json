            "answer": "I also sweat heavily under my left arm, and barely any sweat from under my right arm. I had an operation on the right side of my thorax to remove a benign anterior mediastinal teratoma before this problem occurred, and my dermatologist said that perhaps the operation (which may have severed the sympathetic nerves on my right side under my arm) resulted in my unilateral hyperhidrosis. My surgeon was consulted, and he said this was highly unlikely.I'm still seeing my doctor to go through a number of tests as she has never heard of this problem before.",
