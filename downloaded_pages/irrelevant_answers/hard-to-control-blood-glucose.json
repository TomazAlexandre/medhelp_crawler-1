            "answer": "Hi jasper07, thanks for the reply! She sees her consultant every 3 months and we change her settings on her pump regulary, she eats very healthly and does many different activities to keep fit. The last 2 weeks her BG's have been great without changing anything,the 2 weeks before that she had many high readings and next week they could do anything! there is no pattern to it! I'm just hoping she not one of the few who are uncontrolable!",

            "answer": "Hi! I do understand that sometimes things go hooey. I was diagnosed when I was 10 and from there on fo rme it was always a problems with my regulating my sugars. My total of insulins that I have been on are 10 different ones. I don't like to think this of your daughter but I hope she does not have to wait until she is an adult like myself for control happened. Long before I was told my my doctor that nearing the teen ages, the body makes so many different changes and that was a lot of my problems.\u00a0\u00a0Nowadays, everything is so different too than when I was diagnosed. I was diagnosed 49 yrs. ago and now and have been in control. I only had one complicaton and that Neuropathy in both hands. I ended up having to have CTS surgery and it took all my Neuropathy pain away. Other than that, there are no complications for me. I am very fortunate.",

            "answer": "Thanks jasper,I find it oddly reassuring to know that you had promblems too as a child, and so good to know that you did gain control,even if it did take until you became an adult. Even more pleased you have\u00a0\u00a0very few problems and no longer in pain.Sometimes I feel like a really bad mother not being able to gain good control, and feel everybody else seems to be able to do it, but I do my best and the doctor reasures me that I'm doing all I can.Perhaps when the dreaded hormones subside, like you she will at last gain control!Thanks again Jasper and keep well !!!!!!",

            "answer": "Hi Chrissie,Please try not to blame yourself. You are not a bad mom. I do know of people on the pump and have been a long time and every so often their pump needs tweaking. Some of them do it on their own according to their doctor's orders.. You are your' daughters helper just like my mom was. It is hard at an age too when the body is changing. Has she ever had her insulins changed? You probably already know that everything a diabetic does and eats affects the sugars. Stress is a big factor. I have been through that and still am. I check my sugars 4-5 times a day. When I was 11 yrs old, everyday on my way home from school, I was sick with low sugars at 3:30 pm. Have you tried to keep track of what she does on a daily basis and what she eats to see if there is a change within one of those things? Can she do that on her own even though kids are active and get busy? I am still on shots. When the pump came out I was under too good of a control to be on one. Now, since I am on 4-5 shots a day, I just go with that. I don't like injecting but I want to live.\u00a0\u00a0I was terrified to give myself a shot. It honestly took me 4 years to get the courage. Now it's like old hat as the saying goes. My best friend back then told me she would help me if I ran into any trouble. I injected and found out she lied. She could not help me (scared). I was so mad but it did help me to inject myself. I hope and pray for the both of you that things calm down. It is taking one day at a time.Debbie",

            "answer": "It's no picnic! It does not make any sense that your son cannot get the pump yet. My best friend was running A1C's of 13 and she is now on the pump. Her A1C is down to a 7 now. That's what the pump does along with her own decipline. Since the pump runs insulin all the time into one's body, it will bring down the sugars and that A1C. Maybe you ought to seek another doctor and see what they say. There are children younger than him that are on the pump as well. I do know where you are coming from where your other half does not learn. The only difference is, it's my husband that does not take any big leaps to know the disease better. All he knows is that I have to take my insulin and eat. There is so much more. Please get back to me and let me know what is happening. If you would like you can email me: dnorvellatcomcastdotnetDebbie",

            "answer": "Hi,you are where we were 2 years ago ,my daughters a1c was around 9 mark and that is why she was given her pump, her last a1c was 8.2, which is still too high , but she has had 1 reading of 7.7 and that's the only time she's been under 8 in 10 years!\u00a0\u00a0Although we are still struggerling to be completly controlled, she has found her pump life changing, giving her so much more freedom allowing her to eat what she want's (in reason) and more importantly when she want's! Your son should be a good candidate for the pump,if his blood sugars were in normal range, he would'nt need the pump, so I don't know what your doctor is on about.\u00a0\u00a0Keep asking\u00a0\u00a0that's what I did and hopefully he'll get one soon!",

            "answer": "I just don't get it with the pump. Back in 1986-1987, my doctor told me because I was in such good control, to get freedom and away from injections, I could go on the pump. I said I would think about it. He told me the pump was a great thing and that more and more new pumps would be coming out. Nowadays, all I hear is if a person runs high sugars and A1C'S the pump is the remedy for those things. Even my doctor of today told me a couple months ago that I could go on the pump if I wanted to and I am still in good control.Then am I right in saying if one is or isn't in control, the pump can be used? It doesn't matter anymore?",

She was diagnosed early on ,before she became really ill, although saying that type 1, unlike type 2 can not go undiagnosed for very long. Although it does not sound to me as your daughter has diabetes, there is a very simple urine test, your doctor can do, to put your mind at rest. I hope your baby gets better soonChrissie",

    "question": "My daughter has been type 1 diabetic for 10 years, and is now 11, despite having an insulin pump,(which has given her much better control,) we still struggle to get GOOD control. All her food is weighed,she has at least 10 finger stick tests a day, tested at least twice during the night,but still she gets some days when her blood sugar is sky high and other days , she has many hypos. sometimes she can go 4 or 5 days with perfect control, just when we think we're getting somewhere she'll get a reading off the scale.We know good control is the key in preventing long term damage, but we just do'nt seem to be able to achieve it, however hard we try!\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
