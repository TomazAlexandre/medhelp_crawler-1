            "answer": "I've never heard of anything like that either, but I will say that there are conditions that can be triggered (not caused) by strep throat.\u00a0\u00a0My son's diabetes was dx'd just 2 weeks after he'd had a bout with strep and the doctor said that's what triggered the diabetes to show up then.\u00a0\u00a0Also - weight loss IS one symptom of diabetes........Weight loss can also be caused by an overactive thyroid, among other things.While it's great that you've changed your diet to fresh fruits, veggies, and other healthy foods, I think you need to see your doctor regarding the weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0It might have nothing to do with changing how you eat, or eliminating msg - could be a true physical condition that needs treatment.........",

            "answer": "well, i appreciate everyone's comments, but i certainly don't think i have diabetes. i have never had high blood pressure, in fact my blood pressure is usually lower than most people. have been off table sugar for about 6 months and don't eat candy, aspartame, no one in my family had diabetes, and i just took a test to determine my risk and apparently i am low risk. i really don't think that's what it is.when i gave up msg a few weeks ago, (which meant giving up all condiments and making my own homemade mayo, etc) i ate like a horse. loads of salads and veggies and grains. i did notice i was hungrier but that went away after the first week. that's also when i noticed my legs weren't swollen anymore. i take ballet and my skin wasn't poking out of the slippers the way it normally does. which is very dramatic to me. so part of my weight loss is undoubtably fluid i would imagine.i did go to the doc, and he didn't give me any tests, just gave me an antibiotic that cleared up my strep. having not eaten properly in two weeks, i am sure that is part of why i am losing weight.was more or less just wondering if anyone else had ever came down with strep after detoxing or losing weight too quickly. thanks for your comments.",

    "question": "Hello! I am new to these forums, and would appreciate anyone's ideas about my problem.i just recently (about a month ago) stopped eating food additives, especially MSG. A few days afterwards I noticed that the chronic swelling of my legs had gone down dramatically. I dropped about 5 pounds within a week. But then i felt very ill for a couple days- body aches, general flu like symptoms, of which i understood to be the \"Die-off\" or \"healing crisis\" i have read alot about.I then had a very busy weekend a few days later, and was not able to eat much because the place where i was working (I am a filmmaker and projectionist and help out at a venue where they put on shows) did not have good food readily available. As i had noticed profound changes in my mood ( i had suffered from depression for months and suddenly it was gone, as were my racing thoughts, worry etc) i was not prepared to eat ****. so i ate very little. and i wound up coming down with the worst sickness i have ever had- strep throat and an ear infection.consequently, i have lost 7 pounds in a little under a month- and i am wondering if my body is purging and perhaps the strep was inside me all along and either this is a detox reaction, or else i was simply undernourished and compromised.let me say that i am not trying to lose weight like this. i changed my diet because of my depression. i had no idea that the results would be so dramatic- i tend to be pretty sensitive to things, don't eat wheat anymore because it makes my pulse race (and i don't know why)....but i just find it very weird that after making this great discovery about food additives and msg i drop weight quickly and get horribly sick.i eat organic, fresh fruits and veg, organic milk, no sugar, no wheat, no processed foods at all anymore. my diet is cleaner than it has ever been. with strep i wasn't able to eat much.anyone have any experience with anything like this?",
