            "answer": "That article was interesting. When my two cats were kittens, before I got them, one of them almost died (Hootie) She got better and then my husband brought both kittens home from the friend that had them then Sissy got sick and wasn't eating cat food and got really thin. I fed her what she would eat which was cheese and baby food. Anyway they are both well and healthy now. Hootie likes to try and suckle from my ear lobe which probably means she was weaned too soon. They both love to eat carbs (bread, muffins, donuts, crackers, pretzels lol) Only Sissy though has that weird thing of eating tape. Oh and when they were kittens Hootie would eat cat litter but she stopped doing that but she will eat cat puke, hers or Sissy's. (yuck)\u00a0\u00a0Cats are so weird, that's one thing I adore about them.",

            "answer": "yeah that explains alot of things..glad they are both healthy and doing well :)can I just mention a few things abt diet tho.....carbs are absolutely the worst things for kitties, thats why so many of the carb laden dry foods give them so many health issues...diabetes, crystals, IBD to name a few. I really suggest you stop the carb feeding no matter how much she likes them( I know its hard, one of mine is a carb addict too.)I will send you a site by dr. Pierson on diet, read it over well it will really open your eyes, I know it sure did mine:)http://www.catinfo.org/",

    "question": "My cat Sissy will eat the clear, scotch tape type if she can get a hold of it and I don't catch her eating it. I first thought her interest in tape was just to play with it but no she eats it, then barfs it. She even tries to chew or pull the tape off used to keep the flap of my rolling tobacco closed. I usually have to pull the tape of and throw it out.",
