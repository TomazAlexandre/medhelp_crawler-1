            "answer": "\"I don't eat a bad breakfast, please don't think that.\"BUT.... \"after breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0It spikes to well over 140 (my doctor wants me to keep it under 130) and then crashes an hour later more than 50 points.\u00a0\u00a0It makes me feel *awful*. \" It seems obvious that your breakfast meal is causing your \"crash\". Do you crash if you fast, skipping breakfast?Since you kept it a secret as to what you eat for breakfast, I would suggest that you eat only oatmeal, spiced with some cinnamon and blueberries. If your \"crash\" symptoms go away, its your \"bad breakfast\".",

    "question": "I am very new to this, so please bear with me.\u00a0\u00a0Pre-pregnancy I had a history of high insulin levels in random blood tests as well as symptoms that corrolated to excess carb intake (dizziness, \"foggy\" brain, shaking, blacking out when going too long without food, etc), but when I was referred by my PCP to an endocrinologist he laughed and said there was no way someone with my body type was hypoglycemic (which he said was a myth aside from pre-diabetes), and so I must be imagining the symptoms.Fast-forward to pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I fail the gestational diabetes test.\u00a0\u00a0Only by a couple of points, but I still fail.\u00a0\u00a0Now for the past 3 days I've been testing my blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It's been perfectly normal all day long, as high as 102 and\u00a0\u00a0as low as 72: except after breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0It spikes to well over 140 (my doctor wants me to keep it under 130) and then crashes an hour later more than 50 points.\u00a0\u00a0It makes me feel *awful*.\u00a0\u00a0I eventually recover, but I spend hours throughout the morning where I can't concentrate at all, I get dizzy doing anything that makes me walk around, and I'm constantly squeezing my eyes shut to try to get rid of the blurry vision.I don't eat a bad breakfast, please don't think that.\u00a0\u00a0I know that too many carbs for breakfast makes me sick, it always has my whole life.\u00a0\u00a0IF I eat carbs, they will be whole grains, hands down.Because my results were so borderline, I was not referred to a dietitian or an endo for this pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm kind of on my own right now.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have suggestions to help me get through this?Thanks!",
