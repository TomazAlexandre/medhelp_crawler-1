            "answer": "I read that insulin resistance which leads to diabetes is associated with HCV.\u00a0\u00a0I have a frozen shoulder with peripheral neuropathy - horribly painful at first, now it just won't move.\u00a0\u00a0No one ever mentioned HCV might be related, but I wonder if it could be. Also\u00a0\u00a0had a lot of cavities at the gumline, which the dentist said probably came from me vomiting so much when I was on therapy- but you haven't treated yet,so I guess that wouldn't be the cause for you.\u00a0\u00a0For me the worst symptoms that I'm pretty sure come from the HCV are depression and exhaustion. Then again, a lot of people I know have the same kind of issues, but don't have HCV. So, maybe we're just old and whiny.",

            "answer": "Here is some info on peripheral neuropathy.Neuropathy is a medical term for any disease of the nerves.\u00a0\u00a0There are four major forms of neuropathy \u2013 polyneuropathy, autonomic neuropathy, mononeuropathy and the most common form, peripheral polyneuropathy \u2013 more commonly called peripheral neuropathy (PN).\u00a0\u00a0Peripheral neuropathy damages the nerves in the legs and arms.\u00a0\u00a0Usually the first area that PN affects are the feet and legs before the hands and arms.This article will discuss the HCV-related form of peripheral neuropathy including the cause, symptoms, and treatments. (See below for a related article on PN.)CauseThe exact cause of HCV-related PN is not completely understood, but there is some speculation that it could be caused by HCV RNA deposits in blood vessels that supply oxygen to the nerves, HCV infection of the nerves, an inflammation process in the nerves, and/or an HCV-related immune disorder.\u00a0\u00a0In the past it was believed that only people with cryoglobulinemia developed HCV-related PN but it has been proven that HCV-related PN can occur even in the absence of cryoglobulinemia.\u00a0\u00a0Studies have found that up to 15.3% of the HCV population has PN.\u00a0\u00a0The most common cause of PN is diabetes \u2013 in fact it is estimated that 34% of the diabetic population has PN.\u00a0\u00a0This compares to the prevalence of 2.4-8% in the general population.SymptomsThe most common symptoms of PN are numbness, tingling, sharp pain or cramps, loss of balance and coordination, and pain.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is usually perceived as a steady burning, \u2018pins and needles\u2019, and/or like an electric shock. The symptoms of PN are usually worse at night.\u00a0\u00a0PN can also cause muscle weakness, loss of reflexes (especially in the ankles), and foot problems including sores and blisters that could potentially lead to infections of the skin and bone.\u00a0\u00a0PN doesn\u2019t always progress or become worse; so just because a person develops symptoms of PN it doesn\u2019t mean that it is going to become worse.http://www.hepcaustralia.com.au/symptoms-news/extrahepatic-manifestations-peripheral-neuropath.html",
