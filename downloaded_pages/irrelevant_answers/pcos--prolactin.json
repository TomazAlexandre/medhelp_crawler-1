            "answer": "Wow - you sound like me. I have PCOS, elevated prolactin levels and lower than normal progesterone levels. My dr. sent me for an MRI of my pituitary glad, to find a small tumor on it - said that is common on that part of the PG - nothing to worry about, put me on Cabergoline (Dostinex) once a week to lower my prolactin levels & progesterone, in addition to metformin, as they say it helps with fertility, too. Then they put me on clomid. So - no worries - it does help, and I should know next week if it helped us...The metformin helped me drop some weight too - it was great :-) Best wishes & sprinkles of baby dust !",

            "answer": "Thanks for the baby dust. Best wishes to you - I am sure the dr's will get your levels straightened out and that will help. It was tough to take the weight off - had issues up & down since high school - thought it was my thyroid - close but at least now I know, and easier to handle once I got myself into a routine with eating. You will do great ! Sure you will have NO problems conceiving once they get your levels right.",
