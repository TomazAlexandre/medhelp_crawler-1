            "answer": "Thanks for your respond. Definitely, I did know to take care it clean and no fault smell up to 62 years. It is just started stinky like dead fish smell a few months ago such as like a stinky foot. I thought I may have a fungus down there since I'm a diabetes 10 years ago. I may have to try different antifungal medicines until I get right one for it. The tolnaftate 1% antifungal powder spray seems to help but not 100%. Any other thoughts beside go to see the doc?? Thanks.V/r,",
