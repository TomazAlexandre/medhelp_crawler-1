            "answer": "Hey, I had those symptoms after I was diagnosed and started taking Metformin, BUT...For my situation, originally docs felt it was a combination of my job which required me standing on my feet and walking around 8-12 hours per shift, plus a \"sudden\" shift from\u00a0\u00a0high blood sugars to normal blood sugars threw my fluid balance and electrolytes off for a while... my body had to adjust to being \"normal\" again until I got my diet and activity level balanced and my body \"got used to\" normal blood sugar levels...But, other things my docs looked at were kidney function, especially if there was protein in my urine, any personal or family history or symptoms of gout, rheumatoid arthritis, and heart health: even low-grade congestive heart failure can cause swelling, though it would be unusual for it to occur suddenly and around the same time as diagnosing and controlling diabetes.One other way-out-there thought:\u00a0\u00a0did your husband also get diagnosed with high cholesterol and/or start taking Lipitor or some other cholesterol-lowering drug?\u00a0\u00a0My situation is unusual, but I also started feeling tired and \"off\" (not really weak, but feeling too tired and vaguely sore towards the end of my work days and even when walking my dogs; just didn't \"feel like\" going for as long a walk as I'd usually take them, and when I'd get back home I'd realize my knees and feet were swollen to the point I had a bit of trouble getting my shoes off.)\u00a0\u00a0Long story short: my liver tests were fine, but my docs took me off Lipitor and all my symptoms stopped... so... I don't know... I later restarted Lipitor at a lower dose because all research and studies strongly suggest statins, and especially Lipitor, have beneficial effects upon cardiac, vascular, and brain function, and at the lower dose I haven't had any ill effects... but again, I can't say (and my docs can't say) if my original symptoms were because of Lipitor or \"adjusting\" to a new metabolism or what...That's the total of my two cents...\u00a0\u00a0please give us an update and let us know how he's doing!",

            "answer": "Thanks for your information. My husband is only taking Metformin for his diabetes. They have taken several test and we still don't have any answers. We were sent to a specialist and he prescribed Prednisone for about 15 days. They gave him an injection first and that made the swelling go down pretty fast. Now he is on the medication and we are waiting for some more results. He sure has had problems sleeping with this new medication. His blood presure was fine it has gone up a little but so have his sugar level since starting the medication. He had been doing so good before the onset of whatever this is. Let me know if you's have any other suggestions.",

            "answer": "Any updates?From your last post a few weeks ago, sounds like his docs were concentrating on his symptoms to reduce swelling areas with prednisone (steroid) and that *can* make it more difficult to control blood sugar and blood pressure, but as the doc already knew that those were issues, I assume the potential risks were worth the risk.BUT...\u00a0\u00a0this may sound \"out there\" (and I hesitate a bit because I don't know your husband's full story or why his docs put him on steroid therapy, so take this \"free\" story for what it's worth)...\u00a0\u00a0but I, and a number of other folks I know with blood sugar issues along with other medical issues have had surprising beneficial results by adding fiber (and I mean a LOT of fiber) to our diets even without changing anything else we ate or did, and still following our docs' orders and prescriptions... but, again, though I really think drastically upping fiber intake can help anyone's health, I'm gonna back off and wait until you post again before I offer any other tidbits...",

    "question": "About 3 months ago my husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. Recently he started having a lot of joint pain. Now his ankles and feet are swelling. His sugar levels are doing great. We have been to the doctor and he has had several test done. Everything is coming back good. Has anyone had these same symptoms? He is taking Metformin and I am wondering if this has anything to do with this.",
