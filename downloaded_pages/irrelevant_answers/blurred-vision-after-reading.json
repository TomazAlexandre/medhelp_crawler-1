    "question": "My vision blurrs after several minutes when reading with bifocals which I have read with for years and only recently am having the problem. I am 73.\u00a0\u00a0The longer I read, the worse it gets. The blurring lasts for at least an hour+ and affects both the reading and long distance through my normal distance part of my glasses.\u00a0\u00a0If I read without my bifocals, I have to put the readiing material very close and it is somewhat blurred.\u00a0\u00a0But, after I read w/o glasses for an hour, my vision, both near and far are normal with my glasses.\u00a0\u00a0My Opthomologist is perplexed by the problem, and I am going to try other experiments to see what the results are.\u00a0\u00a0I will read with a pair of distance glasses from at least an arms length and see if it creates any blurring.\u00a0\u00a0I am doing that right now and it does not seem to create any blurring.\u00a0\u00a0I then plan to cover one eye while reading with my bifocals and see what happens.",
