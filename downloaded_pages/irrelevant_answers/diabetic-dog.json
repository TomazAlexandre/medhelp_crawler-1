            "answer": "Recently my 8 year old Pomeranian was diagnosed with Diabetes. Broke my heart. How ironic too since It came and got me one time when my\u00a0\u00a0mom went into a Diabetic Coma..anyway, Glad to hear she is doing well!We feed skipper a special W/D Diet and he has 3.5 units of insulin 3times a day. At 7am-3pm and 11pm. Quite a handful, but we love that dog so much.Make sure she drinks lots of water, goes to the bathroom enough, doesnt sleep all the time, and gets lots of exercise!Best of luck!",

    "question": "Brought our 15 yr old min-pin cross, Tess, to the vet last August after noticing she was losing weight & wasn't her usual 'bossy' self!\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed with diabetes. Spent a week or two having the vet check her blood sugar at various times of the day. The vet requested we administer 2 injections a day of 6 ml canine insulin. We've followed this regimen faithfully ever since. After a month or so, she was so much better. Lately we have noticed she drinks & drinks tons of water!\u00a0\u00a0She's been such a good girl we just want to make sure she's okay!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any help!",
