I tell myself that I could be just like that. Homeless, asking for change, kids taken. Some people look at me and think I got it good. If only they know how I was feeling inside.I thought I hit rock bottom this week, which was why I decided to give this a try. I really dont have to. The pills are free from my ex, he wont cut me off. But I was depressed and miserable and couldnt see a point to life. Its time to quit. I am quitting cold turkey, todays my first day. I quit my job last week because of these feelings. Just try to stay strong and dont wait for a better time. There is no better time.",
