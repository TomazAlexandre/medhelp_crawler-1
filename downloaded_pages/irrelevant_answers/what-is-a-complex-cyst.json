I went to the doc, he even agreed that it sounded like hypothyroid...ran the blood work tests...I patiently waited.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime I received results of an ultrasound that I had done through a mobile lab that ran ultrasound tests on heart, gall bladder, thyroid, kidneys,etc.\u00a0\u00a0Everything came back normal except for a complex cyst on my thyroid....also said bilateral gioter...see a doctor.Anyhow...the doctor said the tsh levels were normal.\u00a0\u00a0SO\u00a0\u00a0I showed him the ulrasound PICTURES and Drs comment regarding the complex cyst. I told him my aunt had to have her thyroid removed and my grandfather had thyroid problems. He told me NO!\u00a0\u00a0No PROBLEMS with your thyroid!\u00a0\u00a0I just about cried!\u00a0\u00a0Actually,\u00a0\u00a0I later did and told him, \"But I FEEL terrible!!\"\u00a0\u00a0He gave me a RX for depression (because I was crying) and referred me to a neurologist for carpal tunnel (I told him about pain that radiates up my left arm and into my heart).I am so confused! AND angry!\u00a0\u00a0What do I do?\u00a0\u00a0What is a complex cyst?\u00a0\u00a0Do I need to look further?\u00a0\u00a0How do I get a doctor to listen?\u00a0\u00a0Am I just crazy?",
