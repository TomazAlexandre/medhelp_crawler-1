It is technically an auto immune skin pigment disorder. I wouldn't call it a disease. I am Caucasian and some blotchy skin areas just don't tan in the summer. People think I have burn scars on my hands.This, of all things and fatigue is why my doc did a Thyroid test ten years ago. He saw the connection.",
