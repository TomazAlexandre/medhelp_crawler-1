            "answer": "Hi fellow Ozzie, welcome to our little MS community :DThere are many medical conditions that mimic the sx's commonly associated with MS, so keep in mind that most often the mimics are not of a neurological causation eg vit B deficientcy, anemia, diabetes, hormonal imbalance, heath anxiety, hypoglycemia, diet, hyperthyroid, viral etc etc The majority of the sx's you've mentioned are quite generic and are commonly associated with so many things, but in general are not typically the clinical signs of a neurological causation.Hyper-reflex is usually the reflex response related to neurological conditions like MS and as far as i'm aware, hypo-reflex, delayed sensory reaction with tingling/numbness in the fingers, are more commonly associated with conditions effecting the peripheral nervous system (MS is central). I personally don't see anything in what you've mentioned that's specifically MSish but if you are still worried, it is always best to seek the opinion of an MS specialising neurologist.Though to be honest, diabetes is banging around my pea brain because it 'could account for all your mentioned sx's' and it's also a condition Pacific Islander's have a high rate of in Australia, so it's probably worth considering at least....Cheers..........JJ",

            "answer": "Thanks Heaps!!!This has really taken the weight off my shoulders. I have actually gotten checked up on the diabetes because I thought that could be something, but it was, gladly, a false alarm. I'm getting a couple of other tests this month, but hopefully it all amounts to nothing!You're an angel supermum_ms!xx",

            "answer": "Hi there from another fellow Ozzie!There was one thing that stood out to me in your symptoms listed & that was the \"light sensitivity.\" This can be caused by many medical conditions but is very common in Migraines. I suffer from migraines around my period time & I get light sensitive, headache, sometimes nausea, dizziness, blurry vision, dropping things & even weakness.There are lots of different kinds of migraines & some even without headaches. They are a neurological condition & can be quite debilitating if they are lasting a long time or are frequent. I'm not saying this is the cause of your symptoms rather suggesting like JJ has that there could be many reasons for your symptoms.Take Care,Karry.",

    "question": "I have recently been experiencing some symptoms that have not only severely impacted my studies, but I believe are a sign of MS, however, a recent MRI shows that that's not the case.I have a family history of MS (my aunt and grandmother, both on my mother's side) and I think that the symptoms I'm experiencing are the beginnings of MS but its yet to be clarified.It all began when I experienced numbness and tingling in my fingertips, I would sometimes even burn myself on the stove and not feel it for about 10 minutes and then, when I did feel it, it was I was being burnt there and then. I also was experiencing extreme, unprecedented and unreasonable fatigue, some dizziness, weakness, blurry vision/sensitivity to light. Also I was experiencing what I think is referred to as 'brain fog' and my mind could barely hold onto new information, instead I'd forget, I'd slip up on words and sentences and I become significantly more introverted.I was referred by my G.P to see a neurologist who then found that my reflexes were noticeably diminished only on my right-side and he sent for an MRI of my brain and c-spine (without contrast).Results came back normal, however I feel like that's not the case - my neurologist even insinuated that I was overreacting and its not that big a deal. I'm not a hypochondriac by any means (if anything I'm under-reactive) but there has to be an explanation for my symptoms. I NEED to know for my peace of mind, and so I can figure out a way of treating or at least finding the cause of my symptoms - they're so debilitating.Furthermore, the reason why much of this post is in past-tense is because one day I woke up and, I didn't realise straight away, but by about 9am, when I wasn't completely exhausted, I realised that virtually all of my symptoms had vanished. This lasted for about three weeks/a month, but they are all now gradually coming back to me.So I know that my MRI has come back negative for MS, but is it possible that I have it, or do you know of any similar issues that could be lending to my symptoms.Further demographics:19 years oldFemaleAustralianCaucasian/Pacific IslanderOtherwise in good health",
