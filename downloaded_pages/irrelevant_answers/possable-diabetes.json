    "question": "Hello. I have been noticing some problems for a while now like blured vision, and tired all the time. My family has a history of diabetes. I did use a friends meter to test my sugar and it came out 87 and from what I understand thats within normal range. What I want to know is with the symptoms being the same and the family history is it still possable to have diabetes or should I look into other causes. Thanks.",
