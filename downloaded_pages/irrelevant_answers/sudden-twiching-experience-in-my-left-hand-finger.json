            "answer": "I agree with LS's comments. You may have something due to repetitive motion injury. Twitching of a finger or other body parts is not a typical symptom of diabetes. You probably should have a good checkup with your doctor, though, in case something else is damaging nerves. You want to correct the problem before permanent damage is done, for sure. My bet is that the computer work is the problem. You might try changing the position of the keyboard or mouse first.",
