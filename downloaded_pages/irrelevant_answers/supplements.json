    "question": "I have had Diabetes for 25 years now.\u00a0\u00a0Last year, I was diagnosed with CAD after a stress test and had two stents placed in my right coronary artery the next day.\u00a0\u00a0A month ago, I had another stress test that revealed some re-narrowing of the arteries, consequently I had three more stents placed.\u00a0\u00a0My diet has been as heart healthy as I can possibly make it, I try to keep saturated fats under 20mg per day as recommended.\u00a0\u00a0My cholesterol numbers have all been in the normal range, with exception to the HDL, which has been in the mid 20's (no matter the amount of exercise I do, it won't budge).\u00a0\u00a0I would like to get others opinions on any good supplement to use.\u00a0\u00a0For example, I have seen an Oral Chelation supplement that is suppose to clear the arteries.\u00a0\u00a0Any and all thoughts would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Michael",
