    "question": "for the past few years i have been getting boils from time to time. They always appear in one of three places. my breasts stomach and inside sides. I used to get them alot they have been less commen now though. They always start out as a red bump and then in next few days become abit bigger and fluid filled and useally painful at that time. They end up poping on the own leaving allittle blood and pus. I figured the ones betweem my thighs are from sweet and rubbing together since i am 300 pounds and sweet alot and since i have big boobs i have to pay 40 dollars for a bra so i may wear the same bra for sevral days in a row and thats when they usally occur. The stomach ones through me off a bit though. They annoy me because sometimes they will leave a scar. Does anyone have any idea why this occurs and how to prevent them",
