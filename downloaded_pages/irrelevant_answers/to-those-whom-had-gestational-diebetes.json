            "answer": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational diabetes with my first pregnancy... I even needed insulin.. not just diet change.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless I had a good pregnancy and labour...My labour was induced at 40weeks exactly and I had a safe delivery.\u00a0\u00a0The only difference you have an extra IV while in labour.\u00a0\u00a0No big deal.. if you haven't had a previous c-section.. and the rest of the pregancy is healthy and your sugar is controlled all should go smoothly.\u00a0\u00a0BTW the reason why some women need a c-section and mostly because with Gestational Diabetes the babies have a tendency to be bigger.Good Luck!",

My Dr induced me at 39 weeks because he though baby was over 8 lbs. I had a quick delivery vaginally, and she turned out to be 6 lbs 12 oz. They checked my sugars twice in the hospital and nothing else. And it turned out I was so big because I had a lot of extra amniotic fluid.",

Im very big because of extra fluid my doc said I might deliver the baby 3weeks b4 my due date I'm also in insulin 3 times a day & getting monitor twice a week & once a week for u/s for fluid... It's kind a ***** coz every time I come in they always check my cervix if open but not it's just extra fluid & baby moving so much... So far so good they also told me I might deliver c-section...not really my idea I deliver normal my first but this might be cs...my advice is just keep control ur eating especially with sugar if ur taking insulin ur in the safe side.... I didnt know I was GD this time & I drink a lot of mocha from coffee bean...that's how I got so big! Lol but right now my stomach is so heavy &cant really do much just being couch potato..",
