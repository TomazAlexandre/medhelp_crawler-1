            "answer": "I agree that if blood sugar is out of the normal range, moods can be off, too. I have never personally noticed my mood changing if I am high, but I tend to have more lows than highs. If low, I notice feelings of anxiety, depression, or irritability. As WAK has noted, this is easily checked by doing a blood test if you notice that you are feeling upset. If low or high, try to adjust. Then notice if you feel calmoer in about 15 minutes, and keep track of these moods. Do discuss with your endocrinologist.",
