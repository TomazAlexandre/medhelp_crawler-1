    "question": "I'm 18 and have recently been suffering from horrible nausea. It started out of the blue one day where I woke up, and minutes later I was running to the bathroom to vomit. Nothing came out except what I believe was stomach bile (orange-yellowish liquid.) After I ate some chicken soup I felt fine. Weeks later this happened again. I ate, and again I felt fine. Now this happens to me every morning, usually minus the vomiting, and is starting to happen throughout the day. Whenever I'm \"hungry\" (meaning my stomach is empty and needs food, not me wanting to eat) I feel nauseous. I haven't actually had an appetite in weeks. I will add that I do have bad anxiety but I see a therapist and managed it well for quite a while. It recently started getting worse when my stomach problems began. I've been losing weight also because I just can't eat! Any and everything will upset my stomach. My mom says it may be an ulcer, (she had one, and is also a very anxious person..runs in the family I guess.) GERD, or low blood sugar. I've also been told to be tested for diabetes, because I'm constantly thirsty and no amount of water seems to quench it. Help me!",
