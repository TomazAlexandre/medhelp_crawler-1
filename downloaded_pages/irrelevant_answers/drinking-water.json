Also, there is nothing worng with drinking carbonated water with a lemon or lime. Try taking a pitcher of water and cut up lemon slices and cucumber slices and put them in there. Refridgerate it over night. It is a very healthy and refreshing drink!",

    "question": "This may sound like a stupid question, but do you think Propel is as good as water? I am a tiny person (5'4\" and 110lb.) So drinking a ton of water is almost impossible. I hate drinking water. Hate it. I have managed to drink three 16.9 oz. bottles of propel a day. I guess I am feeling a little guilty about not drinking straight water. What do you guys think?",
