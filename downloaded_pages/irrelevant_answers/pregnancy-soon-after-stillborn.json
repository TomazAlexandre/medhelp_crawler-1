            "answer": "You won't stop wording. I could not get pregnant till a year and a half later but I am 20 weeks now and this is the time I lost my other baby so I am freaking out about everything. All you can do is try and stay strong and hope for the best. Keep yourself a bit relaxed and get checked out when ever you feel something is wrong. I know my Dr prob is already tired of dealing with me but if I feel something wrong or diffrent and get worried about it I run to the office if its closed I run to the hospital Yeah its expensive but babys life is more important. I wish you the best and just pray and put it all in Gods hands. God bless you",
