            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for posting.There is a possibility of nerve compression in the lower back, but only after a clinical exam can the diagnosis be confirmed.Other possibility includes neuropathy. Have you been tested for diabetes?Diabetes and B12 deficiency can cause neuropathy which can result in tingling numbness.Other possibilities are peripheral vascular diseases. The chances are more if you have a history of smoking.Please consult your GP and let us know if you have any more questions.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the thoughts.I might consider a physio's advice rather than my GP ( or a more patient GP!). I've been tested for diabetes (nothing), and not a smoker.There is a history of back pain which until reading recently I've always considered disassociated with the sharp pain and leg numbness since.Thanks again for your thoughts.",

    "question": "I don't believe this is a life or death issue - but it has bugged me for years.One night while sleeping 6 years ago i was awoken by a sharp stinging pain in the mid outer thigh muscle (left side) - thinking it was a spider or wasp i checked the bed and saw nothing. The wasp like sting occured the following night in roughly the same location. Following each \"sting\" the leg went numb, much like the muscle around a wasp bit does. No swelling though, no pin ***** of blood, and I can't recall any red mark showing.Ever since those nights I get a numbness after 5 minutes of inactivity in the outer thigh region which extends from my left butt down to the left knee if i remain on my back, or sit down on the floor while watching a movie, etc. If i'm leaning back in a work chair the same numbness creeps in until i lean forward. I took it to my local GP but he didn't have the time to wait for the numbness to kick in, and tested me for a stroke.The sharp stinging pain never recurred,\u00a0\u00a0and the numbness is very much like the same feeling as when your foot or arm \"goes to sleep\", with tingling occurring in the outer thigh when (i presume) the circulation kicks in again.Any clues on this one? Only the left leg, only outer thoigh muscle, and never repeated elsewhere in my body.Thanks,W.",
