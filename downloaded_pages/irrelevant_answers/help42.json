It could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. You could also be having a pinched nerve in the neck. It is difficult to diagnose on net. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
