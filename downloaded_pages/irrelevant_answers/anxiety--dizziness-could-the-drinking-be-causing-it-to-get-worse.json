            "answer": "Aloha is right -you just may be saying that to him yourself as you make your exit before he turns his anger on Y-O-U -or shortly after.Yeah, the alcohol is a depressing drug, so it softens the anxiety. For awhile. Until it comes back. With a vengeance. And over time, you need more and more booze to get the same result. It only gets worse.Help for him is tough, if he doesn't want the help or, more likely, doesn't think he even needs it. If he gets in trouble with the law, he MIGHT be put in rehab, where he'll dry out and then start all over again. And meanwhile, his liver is disintegrating.Based on what you report, the only help here is for YOU. Go to Al-anon -the group for spouses and family members of alcoholics. They'll give you the drill -and you're going to need it. And the sooner YOU go, the more prepared you'll be for what comes next.I wish you the very best. This is serious business, so take it seriously, and start RIGHT NOW.",

    "question": "My husband has anxiety, dizziness, and drinks 12-24 beers everynight. Could his drinking be causing his anxiety and dizziness? He says that drinking is the only thing that makes him feel normal. And when he drinks he gets angry and likes to start fights so any help would be great. He is only 25.",
