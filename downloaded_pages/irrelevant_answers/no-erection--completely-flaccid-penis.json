            "answer": "Hello,I agree with the doctors that it can be due to nerve compression or nerve damage to the penis. There are many other causes like stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure,negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression and neurological causes but there is no ovious cause for these. However they also need to be ruled out.I suggest you to get evaluated for these possibilities from a urologist. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am in my mid 20sI am not sure what has happened, i was working out and was struggling with the weight i was lifting and had to rest the weight on my body (60kgs or so), so save my face from the weight. As a result I kept the bar with the weight for about 5 seconds, on the stomach and then moved it swiftly to my hips/pelvis.I have noticed that after the work out my erection has gone, completely. I have never had a problem, always get hard numerous times in a day, and wake up hard every morning.There is no pain in penis area or when even I pass urine, though i have noticed that there is a nasty smell on the , much stronger then usual when I urinated the day after. There is no visible swelling in area.Have i damaged something?, and what shall I do?. I have seen a couple of doctors, they think it may be nerve damage, but they admited that this is a unknow for them. I am waiting to see a urologist soon, but I want some advice, and ideas about what I could have damaged for this problem to happen, and ideas about remedies if there are, or if I have caused myself irrevocable damage.Its been 6 days, No erection, completely flaccid penis.",
