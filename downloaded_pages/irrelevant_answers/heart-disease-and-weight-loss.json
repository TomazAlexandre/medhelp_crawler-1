            "answer": "Try to avoid restaurant food whenever you can. If you find you have to go to a restaurant try \"generously\" passing off portions of your food onto others or just leaving half on the plate. A little evil yes, but better your work colleagues overeat than you ;-)",

    "question": "I 'm 39 and had angioplasty for a heart blockage last year. I take 40 MG Lipitor, 75 MG Plavix and 81 MG asprin daily. My BP and pulse have always been good -- 118/80 and 56 last check. I have bad family history -- early heart attacks and premature death in men on both sides. I am a 3 mile a day runner, 4-5 days a week. With Lipitor, my cholesterol is good -- 127 total and 32/76 hdl/ldl.Yet I am overweight and I am wondering how much I should worry about that. I weigh about 225 and I'm 5-foot-10. I have long struggled to bring it down and only had success when I followed the Atkins diet, but I am afraid to go that route now that I know I have heart disease.I really struggle to eat right. I do pretty well at avoiding the obvious bad foods, like beef and fried items, but I tend to over eat no matter what I have for a meal. I eat a lot of salad, hummos, granola, yogart and oatmeal in my daily routine, and I stick to water and sugar-free, non-carbonated drinks (and I have quit caffine). But I tend to binge on pizza, sandwiches, creamy soups, fruit, pudding, and the like at restaurants, meetings, etc. Any advice here? I keep praying for a safe, effective appetite drug to come along.",
