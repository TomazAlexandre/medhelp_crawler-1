            "answer": "Hello,No medical conditions can hamper HIV tests. The incubation period for hiv antibodies to generate is from 4 weeks to 3 months. For 4th gen test you need to wait for 4 weeks and take a test after that. For traditional antibody test you need to wait for 3 months and then test. Good luck.Regards",

            "answer": "No worries. There are no medical conditions that delay HIV antibody. In theory, advanced immune deficiency could do it, such as with terminal cancer or potent immune suppressing drugs. But even these are theoretical only; in the real world they probably don't. Certainly an arterial tear of HPV would have no effect.Best wishes to your friend for a speedy recovery.",
