            "answer": "Hi - I have PCOS. I had a miscarriage last year. I've had the symptoms for years, but the doctors missed it, depsite rather obvious symptoms.Anyway, I'm now 20 weeks pregnant - thanks to Metformin - a drug used in increase insulin sensitivity (originally designed for Diabetics). I didn't have any periods - I was told I was infertile. When I started taking this, my periods came back within 2 months. Within 4 months of taking metformin I became pregnant for the 2nd time. This often happens with PCOS sufferers, although some also take CLOMID to help them to ovulate.I spent a lot of time looking into how to at least get through the first crucial 12 weeks - there's quite a lot of evidence that PCOS women suffer a far higher m/c rate - a lot to do with low progesterone levels I understand, amoungst other things - PCOS women seem to sometimes take progestone pessaries. I stayed on Metformin (against my GPs wishes, but they are completely uninformed so I just went with all the info I'd found out) for the first trimester. Metformin looks like it helps massively reduce m/c rate. Its a FDA class B drug - not certified for use during pregnancy, but it doesn't look like it does any harm.So, I came off it at 12 weeks - there is also evidence that it helps reduce Gestational Diabetes, another thing that PCOS women are more likely to get. But, I wanted to come off it asap as the long term effects are as yet unknown. I've been taking baby aspirin - also some evidence that PCOS is related to blood clotting problems too. But its all such a new area ...I strongly recommend you find yourself a good Reproductive Endocrinologist. I've not, and fell like I'm wondering around in the dark - PCOS is little known or understood by the medical profession in the UK, from my experience. I'm on mailing lists at www.pcolist.org, which is a really good place to hear how other people cope with it. I strongly recommend it.Good luck.Laura",
