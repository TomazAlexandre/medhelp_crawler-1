            "answer": "I actually tested high and had to go to the diabetes clinic.The nutritionist should tell you everything you need to know.Avoid sugar is key.They put me on a specific diet.Breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack.No fruits at all until lunch as they have natural sugars.No juice just crystal light, milk and water.Protein at lunch and supper (do not overdue it)bedtime snack has to be a grain. (piece of toast, crackers, cheese)Vegetables are all you can eat.Fats are ok but to be used in moderation as you do not want to get too fat.I have a chart full of no no foods. Off the top of my head its chocolate, sugar, jams, juices, white bread. There's more but i'd have to look at it.Also bread has to be whole wheat and only one slice with breakfast.he should go over this with you. You might get a machine to check your levels as well. (don't worry the pricking really doesn't hurt at all)If you do have gestational diabetes you increase the chance of a big baby and also maybe C-section. Also the chances of you and the baby getting Type 2 later on in life is 50%.Also the baby could have respiratory problems. But if you keep your sugars low from now on, your baby will most likely end up fine.I never heard of it being controversial, that's news to me. Seems like a real issue. Diabetes is pretty real and in pregnancy can happen due to a resistance to insulin entering the cells.If you need more info on what they gave me, give me a shout. I'll be happy to help you.",

            "answer": "yeah you will find a 'debate' on about anything these days. this same debate happends over drinking a glass of while every once and awhile. just because many say it's ok and the babies are fine in most cases, does not mean FAS is not in fact real.considering the amount of people who get tested, have high glocose, and without proper diet all seem to have the same outcome (large babies, respitory issues,etc) i would pretty much consider it a quite REAL thing.all in all diet and excersize is what you need to ensure the best for your baby.",

            "answer": "I think you totally missed my point but hey that's okay. i see that stat and simply shrug. Just like many out there. Out of those 30% how many actually did what was right and watched what they ate to have a successful pregnancy? Once you are aware of it most people become more careful and in turn have no problems at all. So of course the odds of having those outcomes will be decreased. Doesn't make it a real thing.I'm sorry but I take it seriously. I don't brush it off based on a few peoples reasearches on the matter. Pregnancy is so complex and different for many people. I doubt you can put a statistic on these type of things.I just wouldn't be so passive about it. Just know it's there, know it CAN be an issue, and do what's right to ensure your baby is healthy. Regardless of having GD or not, you want to do what you can to eat right because it isn't all about you right now.",
