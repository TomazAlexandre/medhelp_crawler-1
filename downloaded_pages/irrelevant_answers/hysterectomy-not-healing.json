            "answer": "Hi dk, oh my goodness, I am so very sorry to hear of this , you must be frantic! Im going to do everything in my power to try to help you. I can atleast hopefully ease some fears, answer some questions and point you in a more positive direction.I have been community leader on here for almost a year and have studied hysterectomys extensivley, had one myself..I thought I had heard it all till I read your post today, this is really not acceptable!\u00a0\u00a0I do think its very possible that your warfin may be slowing the healing down.,.I found a good bit of information about delay in wound healing, what follows is a cut and pasteD = Diabetes: The long-term effects of diabetes impair wound healing by diminishing sensation and arterial inflow. In addition, even acute loss of diabetic control can affect wound healing by causing diminished cardiac output, poor peripheral perfusion, and impaired polymorphonuclear leukocyte phagocytosis.I = Infection: Infection potentiates collagen lysis. Bacterial contamination is a necessary condition but is not sufficient for wound infection. A susceptible host and wound environment are also required. Foreign bodies (including sutures) potentiate wound infection.D = Drugs: Steroids and antimetabolites impede proliferation of fibroblasts and collagen synthesis.N = Nutritional problems: Protein-calorie malnutrition and deficiencies of vitamins A, C, and zinc impair normal wound-healing mechanisms.T = Tissue necrosis, resulting from local or systemic ischemia or radiation injury, impairs wound healing. Wounds in characteristically well-perfused areas, such the face and neck, may heal surprisingly well despite unfavorable circumstances. Conversely, even a minor wound involving the foot, which has a borderline blood supply, may mark the onset of a long-term nonhealing ulcer. Hypoxia and excessive tension on the wound edges also interfere with wound healing because of local oxygen deficits.H = Hypoxia: Inadequate tissue oxygenation due to local vasoconstriction resulting from sympathetic overactivity may occur because of blood volume deficit, unrelieved pain, or hypothermia, especially involving the distal extent of the extremities.E = Excessive tension on wound edges: This leads to local tissue ischemia and necrosis.A = Another wound: Competition between several healing areas for the substrates required for wound healing impairs wound healing at all sites.L = Low temperature: The relatively low tissue temperature in the distal aspects of the upper and lower extremities (a reduction of 1-1.5\u00b0C [2-3\u00b0F] from normal core body temperature) is responsible for slower healing of wounds at these sites.have you had blood work done to rule out the possibility of any hospital acquired infection that may delay wound healing such as MRSA?You are more than welcomed to pm me, or post again on here,,ask me anything you wish, I will search until I find a answer for you.all the best, advocate for yourself, be pushy if you have too, sometimes when \"nice\" doesnt work w drs and nurses you may have to switch it up to not so nice,,having a non intact surgical wound since early summer is beyond ridiculous.Cherie",

    "question": "Hello everyone. I had a total hysterectomy on June 17th of this year. I have had trouble ever since. After surgery I developed a blood clot in my left leg. I am now on warafin for it.\u00a0\u00a0I was cut up and down\u00a0\u00a0for the hysterectomy. The outside of the incision has healed but I have a 0.3\u00a0\u00a0x\u00a0\u00a00.3 on the outside and 11.5 depth of the wound.\u00a0\u00a0I am now having to go to the hosptial where i live to have the bandages changed once a day in the mornings, they say I will have to go back to the surgeon and have it looked at becuase i have not healed any since the week after the surgery. Can anyone help me in what to dothank youscared",
