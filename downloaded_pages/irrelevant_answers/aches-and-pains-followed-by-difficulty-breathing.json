    "question": "Hi there,For the past few months I have been getting an increasing leg pain (I had this a lot through childhood but I don't think anyone really understood the pain I was in and it was disregarded), throughout both legs. As it has progressed I find little random pains in my both, particularly my forarms and too my legs. I am now, and have been for the past few days having trouble breathing, I find myself trying togasp for air frequently. I am finding that Ihave to rely on breathing through my nose, lightly. Any suggestiong? It's really starting to get on my nerves! Thanks very much.",
