            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The tingling could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause tingling of little and ring finger.Your symptoms could also be due to carpel tunnel syndrome. In this the median nerve is compressed at the wrist in a place called the carpel tunnel. Symptoms begin with numbness and tingling of the first three or two fingers from the thumb side. Nerve conduction studies are quite diagnostic. Treatment is usually by splints and steroid injections. Surgery may be required in some cases. This condition is common in those who use the key board, mouse etc a lot\u2014like in computers or in typing jobs.The commonest cause of pain in the calf\u00a0\u00a0is DVT and clots and post exercise. Pain in the calf area can also be due to pinched spinal nerves in the lumbo-sacral area or a pinched nerve at the knee joint. A nerve conduction study should be done. A MRI of the lumbar spine should also be able to throw some light. A deep vein thrombophlebitis or intermittent claudication (spontaneous spasm and relaxation of arteries) can also cause similar symptoms.At times it is also due to low sodium, potassium, magnesium or calcium in the body. Hence serum levels of these electrolytes should also be checked. Dehydration is another frequent cause.It could be that you have arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis or some posture problem that is causing compression of nerves at various levels. It can also be serum electrolytes deficiency. It can also be due to TIA or ministroke. The symptoms include temporary loss of sensation in any part of the body, black outs, vision loss, tingling, loss of function of a limb etc. It is common in people with high blood pressure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and high cholesterol.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello... I am a 24 year-old female with severe tingling in my hands/wrists. My doctor has confirmed that I have unusually low blood pressure. I also get what are commonly known as \"Charley horses\" in my calves and feet; as well as dizziness and/or slight blackouts. Obviously I have blood flow problems, but is there something a bit more serious going on? The tingling hasn't lasted this long before... it's going on the third hour.",
