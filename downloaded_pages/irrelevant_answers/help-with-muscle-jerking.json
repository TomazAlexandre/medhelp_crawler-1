            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If the whole body is jerking then it could be epilepsy. A normal EEG does not rule out epilepsy. It is then diagnosed by watching the patient\u2019s response to anti- epileptics. Another possibility is that cerebellum portion of the brain is involved. Spinal compression very high up close to cerebellum is another possibility.Tremors/jerking are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind including sleep studies. Hope this helps. Take care!",
