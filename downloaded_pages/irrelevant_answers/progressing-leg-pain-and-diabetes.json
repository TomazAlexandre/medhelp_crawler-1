    "question": "Hello,I\u2019m a little confused and lost and my Doctors a little unsure what\u2019s going on and is sending me for a MRI Scan on my Spinal cord and Brain. My situation is this; 7 months ago I was having a hard time sleeping and had some leg cramps that were keeping me up at night, so my doctor had me take a blood test\u00a0\u00a0which found that I\u2019m type # 2 diabetes. I then took the medication proscribe to help get my Sugar under control. Then about a month after the blood test I started having REALLY bad leg pains. I returned\u00a0\u00a0to my doctor and he said it could be due to the diabetes, so I was prescribed lyrica which has helped a bit but now I\u2019m at the 7 month period and the pain in my leg\u2019s from the calf down are Bad and I can\u2019t sleep anymore. The pain ranged from burning sensations to freezing and electrical pin\u2019s and needles, also numbness. Recently I went to a Neurologist and they couldn\u2019t get a base line on the nerves in my legs, also when she checked my reflexes I didn\u2019t have any in my legs or my arms. I\u2019m currently waiting to have two MRI\u2019s one on my brain and a second on my spinal cord, my questions is what could cause these symptoms? And is it treatable?",
