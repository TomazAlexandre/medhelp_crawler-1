            "answer": "Hello TheSon,As you know, we're not physicians and we cannot do online diagnoses (beware of ANY site that claims to do that, by the way).I'm not sure how long after eating you were getting your results, but it is NOT uncommon for healthy non-diabetics to have readings like you reported.\u00a0\u00a0So much depends on what types of food (not just carbohydrates, but also the mix of fat & protein with those carbos), general health, etc.Hunger is not unusual if we are not getting the \"right\" mix of nutrients.\u00a0\u00a0It's our body's way of signalling that it NEEDS soemthing.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps you'd benefit from a few sessions with an nutritionist who can help you plan meals & snacks that will keep you feeling satisfied.\u00a0\u00a0S/He may also be able to help you with weight-gaining strategies -- that almost always include a nutrition component and a physcial activity component.Since you seem to be concerned enough to do fairly frequent blood tests (for someone who has not been dx'd with diabetes), I'd recommend that you keep careful notes of your foods and exercise & these results.\u00a0\u00a0THen, bring them to your doctor for an evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0Genetics and other things can affect our body size & weight, so it's best to talk to your doc about specifics that pertain to you.I hope this has been helpful.",

    "question": "hi all, I posted earlier in this board regarding some suspecious readings. At that time, average readings were 85-115.Things have changed, yet, my diet and eating habits are still the same.So what happened?I have been having high numbers, well not sure if they are really high, but from previous readings and averages, they are indeed high.I got numbers like:161 (after breakfast, which has never been that high, 100 max)158 (also after breakfast)148 (this surprised me the most, this was 04:30 p.m., usually at this time, my BS is always normal)130 (random)138 (also random)110 (this was 3 hours after lunch)Surprisingly, yesterday I got 80 right after a very carb-rich dinner, which also consisted of chocolate cake. I don't know why or how. Maybe it's worth to mention that right before this dinner it was 96.I'm 25/male/5.7/130 lbs (underweight, I know).I don't have any of the so-called classic symptoms of diabetes except the increased hunger. I am always eating despite the low weight (it's been my normal weight long time ago)Any clues? ideas?thank you",
