One is around 3500 (Lipase, I think) and the other around 450. I still have minimal pain, if any. I had an ultrasound of everything this morning and will hopefully get the results back soon. They also tested something for my liver in the blood test, but I'm guessing that came back fine since they didn't say anything.They seem to think it's my gullbladder. But I have very minimal pain. What else could they be looking for or what else could it be?",

My CT scan showed no pancreatitis. I too, do not drink, though I do have a mildly fatty liver from high triglycerides. My gallbladder has been removed for some years now.It was determined that I had diverticulitis and a sigmoid stricture/twisting/kinking due to severe and extensive adhesions from a previous abdomino-pelvic surgery.I noted the original poster said they were very constipated.......my GI doc told me that elevated amylase can be completely due to intestinal problems. (of course, it can be due to many other thing too) Perhaps the issue is not the liver/gallbladder/pancreas complex..but rather, due to an intestinal problem.",

            "answer": "wow, I had the exact issue described above. I had severe lower left abdominal pain one morning and I went to the doc and they found that the lipase levels were very high (around 17000. Normal levels are between 90 and 170). It sounds crazy, but is true. The doc said he had never encountered a case like this in 20 years. I don't smoke or drink and am a vegetarian.\u00a0\u00a0I had no nausea, no fever, basically no other symptoms. They referred me to a specialist and that guy did an abdominal CAT scan and found no kidney stones and found my liver and gallbladder to be functioning quite normally. After a lot of discussions, they determined that I had diverticulitis (he did mention something about sigmoid, but I don't remember now). I am actually glossing over quite a few details here -- they must've done at least 7 blood tests to verify that I had no other issues and that there was no error in those tests. The funny thing was that the lipase level dropped from 17000 to 9000 after a few days and went back to 19000 after some more days. 3 or 4 specialists determined that the high pancreatic lipase level was a red herring and my pain was due to diverticulitis. They said that I was one of those rare people born with a high pancreatic enzyme count and that they didn't know why. The high lipase level in the blood itself doesn't cause any harm, it is just usually a bio-marker for pancreatitis, but in my case, it wasn't. The only difference is that in my case, there is nothing wrong with the gall bladder as well and I had no previous surgeries.",
