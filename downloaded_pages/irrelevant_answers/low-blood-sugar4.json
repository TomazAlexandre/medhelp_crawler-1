            "answer": "Hi, My sister has MS after falling on ice. We noticed she has very low blood sugar. When she eats 6-8 meals a day she walks best. She also found out that when you have low blood sugar your adrenaline kicks in and fatty acids are used up in fat cells and then you get inflamation ie fibrosis. She is taking protein bars and altoids every 4 hours and doing better. I believe also they have glucagon pills. mystry.Diane",
