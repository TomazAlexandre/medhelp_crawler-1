    "question": "He is driving me insane. He keeps insisting I have pcos even though the metformin did the opposite of what pcos patients would react to it. And the guy didn't remember a single thing about my case. He forgot I don't have milk discharge because of prior surgeries and yet every visit he keeps asking about it. He actually said I do have thyroiditis but because their normal levels he doesn't want to do anything about it. That was the first time he ever said I had thyroiditis. And he still won't do a full pituatary panel on me. He insisted the tumor is decreasing in size because of the medication which is not true because it's still the same size. And my parents encouraged him to keep misdiagnosising me. I'm so mad I can scream. I am even more mad at my parents because they kept insisting I should not have spoken up when he kept insisting I have disorders I don't have.",
