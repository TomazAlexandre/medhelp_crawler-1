            "answer": "Dear annalise,i don't know a lot about the device except that because it uses glocose from the arm rather than the fingertip it has to be calibrated by a finger tip glucose reading when put on. i have also heard that it may not be as accurate as using the blood from a fingertip reading. But it may be helpful for your son if he is experiencing frequent lows. i went through a period of frequent lows and lost my ability to feel them and got into a terrible car accident because of that. Hope your insurance will pay for it, bret",

            "answer": "Annalise,Welcome back!Sometimes endos use a device that they send home with their patients for a few days to do continuous monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0That data is collected & analysed -- along with regular fingertip testing that BL mentioned -- but the patient doesn't have the investment in the equipment.\u00a0\u00a0These continuous sensors are not intended as a substitute for fingertip testing but can be very helpful to poinpoint patterns that can then be treated.Here's some info that's a coupla years old, but is from the Joslin Diabetes Centers.\u00a0\u00a0They are at the forefront of diabetes research & treatment.http://www.joslin.org/Files/Monitors_ClinGuide.pdfIn the short term, if you/your child's school is noticing \"time of day\" patterns when his BG plummets, talk to your endo about insulin and/or food adjustment to avoid them.\u00a0\u00a0If we have a series of lows in a cluster, we temporarily lose our ability to detect the next one... so it's a catch 22.\u00a0\u00a0The more we have, the more we are LIKELY to have another one, since we can't feel it 'til it's too late.\u00a0\u00a0It's important to go at least a few days w/o a serious low in order for the liver to rebuild its glycogen stores, too.HOpe this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "Has anyone ever used the GlucoWatch?\u00a0\u00a0The school nurse is recommending it, since my 8-year-old son has so many lows and can't tell most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0I know the watches are very expensive, and I'm not sure whether our insurance will cover it. Just wondered if anyone had an opinion -- good or bad -- about the device.",
