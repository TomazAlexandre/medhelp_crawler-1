            "answer": "Yes, keaij they are supposed to take your blood before you drink at the 3 hr test as this is called the fasting blood sugar level which is an important factor in determining gestational diabetes...and no worries cedesmarie\u00a0\u00a0you'll be fine. No harm done, I have gestational diabetes and had one high reading in all the weeks I've been testing my sugar and the doctor explained to me that once here and there is not a problem. It becomes dangerous when your sugar is constantly too high because the baby's body is now trying to pump put enough insulin meet the levels in your body and when they are born their bodies continue to produce too much insulin causing them to have low blood sugar.. There are also other problems that can occur for baby and mom but again no worries you'll be fine",
