You really need to consult with whoever is managing this, either your primary care guy or your endocrinologist. It can lead to permanent nerve damage and eventually loss of toes, limbs and the ability to walk. He/she can work with you to help you lower your blood sugar levels to reduce further damage. Have you ever been to a diabetes education class where they teach you about diet and exercise etc?Please don\u2019t let this go, Danni.--Bill",

            "answer": "Yes, get checked right away and like suezeque said you need to check for ketones!!!www.ncbi.nlm.nih.govDiabetic ketoacidosis is a problem that occurs in people with diabetes. It occurs when the body cannot use sugar (glucose) as a fuel source because there is no insulin or not enough insulin. Fat is used for fuel instead....Also something to note if you have cirrhosis and an enlarged spleen: my a1c numbers tend to run lower than they should be as the test assumes an average life span of red blood cellsclinical.diabetesjournals.org/content/22/1/42.fullby M McNeely - 2004 - Cited by 4 - Related articlesAny condition that reduces erythrocyte survival, such as cirrhosis or hemolysis resulting from hypersplenism can cause spuriously low A1C levels.A fructosamine test will show you more accurate numbers although they don't go back as far as an a1c does.Diabetes can be a fully manageable condition, but man it can be frickin tough, especially around the holidays.And like Bill said, it is not just diet, exercise is soooo important.If you fall off, don't get discouraged, get back on and do it again.I say\u00a0\u00a0this as much for my benefit as anyone else!We can't afford to wait until we are going blind and they start chopping off our body parts...Good luck and hang tough,Chris",
