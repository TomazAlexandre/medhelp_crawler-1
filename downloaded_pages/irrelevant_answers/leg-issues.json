You should also make sure you do not suffer from any thyroid problems or problems such as anaemia.If all your levels are fine then go for mineral analysis blood tests.If there is no discrepancy in any values then you have to go aggressively for cardio activities and follow a strict diet plan to come back into shape.Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi thanks for the advice but I have ruled out all of those things. The only current health issue I have is Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. I heard this makes it harder to lose weight. Its hereditary. I suddenly gained weight at 11 and I was active that whole summer and I gained weight. Its been a struggle ever since, but since my mom didn't have health insurance, I didn't find out until last year. I was always wondering why I kept eating healthy and working why was I not losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0I have had issues with my shoes. I have wide feet and its hard to find good shoes.",

            "answer": "I don't want to be harsh, but it sounds like you're making a lot of excuses ... you're part the way there with the exercise, but there's this issue with the calves. Are you wearing the right trainers? They may not be supporting you in the right places and thus your calves are suffering. Your foot may need more support on the inside as it rolls in, or vice versa. Also, make sure you stretch properly before and after exercising.I have polycystic ovaries and I found out by going to my GP in my early 20s because my periods stopped. I'm overweight, always have been, but have always been active and a card carrying member of the gym for 10 years. You should speak to the trainers in the gym where you take your classes and ask their advice - don't hide behind these forums where you can tell Dr's that you've done everything they've suggested. You've got to help yourself - come on, you can do it!",

            "answer": "That wasn't harsh.....I have spoke to my doctors...they just tell me to keep working out and my personal trainers tell me the same thing. I don't know what kind of shoes to where because I wear a 7 to 8 triple wide in shoes so its been hard for me to find the right shoe. I have been looking for shoes the last couple of days though, so its funny you mentioned that. I appreciate the honest answer. Thanks a lot.",

            "answer": "Also, I'm not hiding behind the forums....I am trying to use them to get advice from other people who have had similar circumstances. All my doctors have told me is to lose weight because that will help all my problems. They haven't helped much. Are you from the U.S.? I'm just curious if you were from England because most people here don't refer to shoe as trainers. That's awesome if you are from England. I bet you have better health care out there. The doctors here suck. Its hard to find good ones and I am guessing I still need to look for a better one. Anyway, my periods stopped on me last year as well. I had always had issues with being irregular since I was 12 when I started. I had a dead beat mom and a hard working dad, so I never had much parental guidance. I am on my own trying to figure out how to take care of myself. All I have is doctors, friends, and the internet. Everyone else just tells me I'm weird and they don't know. Well you have a good day. Thanks again.",

    "question": "Hello, I was wondering if anyone can answer this question for me.\u00a0\u00a0I have been trying to lose weight since I was a teenager, and since before then, I have walked everywhere I go.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been really active, but about 10 years ago, I stopped being as active because I worked on my feet for 12 hours a day.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, for the last 4 years, I have noticed that when I walk now, I can't.\u00a0\u00a0My calves start to burn and hurt in the back of them and they get really weak.\u00a0\u00a0Its mostly when I walk uphill, but it happens sometimes when I am walking normally as well.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone tell me why this is?\u00a0\u00a0I feel bad because I walked forever, and now all of the sudden, the last 4 or 5 years its a struggle for me.\u00a0\u00a0I am overweight, but that never hurt me before so I don't get what the issue could be.\u00a0\u00a0I would ask my doctor, but I don't want to hear \"you're fat\", I already know that, that is why I am trying to exercise more. But how can I do that is my calves are on fire and weak?\u00a0\u00a0I do other types of exercise like Zumba, kickboxing and belly dancing, and during those times I get that way as well, just not as bad as when I jog or walk.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone give me any answers?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
