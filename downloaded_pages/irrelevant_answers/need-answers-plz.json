            "answer": "Let's start at the beginning. A fasting glucose [blood sugar] range of 115 or 121 indicates prediabetes. When you get above 126 mg/dl you are considered a diabetic. To get from 115 to 126 does not take much so now is the time to reverse your prediabetic condition.Losing 20 lbs will help significantly lower your glucose level along with daily exercise and proper nutrition. I saved this from a previous of mine: Proper nutrition means to accentuate the positive when it comes to food. I dislike the word diet. \u201cDiet\u201d implies a rigorous, self-sacrificial discipline that\u2019s doomed to fail. Instead, focus on achieving food goals of what you should eat each day rather than what you shouldn\u2019t eat. When you consume more vegetables, healthy fats [such as olive oil and nuts], lean proteins, fruits combined with low carbohydrate, low calorie, low starchy foods, your hunger will be satisfied and you will naturally want to make better choices. Avoid eating white foods - anything made with white flour [white breads, rolls, pasta, crackers, etc], potatoes, and white rice. Limit caffeine intake too.If you have an Endocrinologist [a diabetes doctor] or a diabetes nurse, or a nutritionist they can help you a lot with nutritional guidelines - Serving sizes, and how many servings of each type food that's safe for you.",
