            "answer": "Nipple discharge is NEVER normal unless you are lactating. Sometimes burning nipples and pain are normal due to hormonal changes before your period, but what you are explaining is irregular. PLEASE CALL YOUR OB/GYN IMMEDIATELY and make an appt forexamination. TELL THEM ITS VERY URGENT!\u00a0\u00a0She should order a breast MRI or Ultrasound to check for mastitis (infection behind the nipple) or to see whats going on under the surface. A warm compress or bath can help with the pain. After that an ice pack surrounded by a washcloth or thin towel for 10 - 15 minutes might help too. Keep the area clean and dry. Wear a gym type stretchy bra - no underwires or pushups! You can put some gauze or cotton around the nipple area to take off some pressure and to keep material from rubbing there.\u00a0\u00a0PLEASE DONT DELAY TO SEE YOUR DOCTOR. ONLY A DOCTOR CAN DIAGNOSE YOU. I know its VERY painful! Dont delay!",

    "question": "Hello. I experience a burning pain in my nipples on exertion. It's almost always both nipples, and it only occurs when I've been exercising, doing yard work, or otherwise exerting. I get mammograms every year, and they have always been normal. My gynecologist has told me I have fibrocystic changes in my breasts. Is this burning pain on exertion somehow related to that or one of my other problems listed below? The burning pain yesterday was intense! Even after I came inside, resting, got a lukewarm shower, and rested some more, it continued. There is no pain anywhere else in my breasts; this is just strictly the nipples. There is nipple discharge, itching, roughness, or color change. I've been experiencing this a few months now.A little background medical history...I am a 47yo white female. I still have my menstrual cycle, though it is beginning to become a little irregular. I might skip a month or two here and there. I also have mild hypertension, LADA/type 1.5 diabetes (not on insulin yet), hypothyroidism (Hashimoto), and Crohn's disease. Everything is well controlled.I have my yearly gynecological exam coming up in the near future and certainly will ask her, but I just wanted to put this question out there to see what I could find out now. Any help is greatly appreciated.",
