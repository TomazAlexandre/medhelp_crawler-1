            "answer": "well, i don't know how much i can help... i just know \"demyelination\" is when the myelin in your nervous system is wearing down. myelin is the fatty tissue that conducts a signal between nerves throughout your body.i have pernicious anemia... it's a low level of red blood cells in your body caused by a lack of vitamin B12... if u're a vegetarian, or don't eat a lot of animal products, u could always take B12 supplements to help. a lack of B12 in your system can weaken or break down myelin (in addition to causing anemia).the only other things i'm aware of that could possibly affect myelin are age (mainly due to malabsorption of B12 as u get older) or multiple sclerosis. unless u've had any alarming symptoms worth worrying about, i wouldn't be too concerned.my sister studied psychology, which included her favourite unit on brain physiology... if i see her later on tonight i'll try to see if i can get her to check out your posting and let u know if she has any clue what any of those test results actually mean.in the meantime, i hope some of this helped, even if just to expand your mind a little, hehe.good luck... and be grateful... where i live, there's a 6 month waiting list for any mri... whether u're concerned about a brain tumour or twisted ankle, the wait is the same. it's horrible.",

            "answer": "I have heard that spots on your brainj can also be because of migraines, I had an MRI in Jan 06 and it said I have a few punctate T-2 bright signal foci in the subcortal white matter which are non specific and definitly not pathologic. Does any one know what that means? I have had other symptoms as well and to me it means that I have MS but The DR said I do not, my other symptoms are arm, hand and leg tingling. visual problems, occasional numbness in vaginal area, occasional weekness in arms and legs, occasional fatigue, headaches,, constipation, weird sounds and sensations in my brain, almost feels like its short circuiting. I wonder If I hademylenation going on if one could feel it ?Any one KNow. Anyways if you do not have any other symptoms then I doubt you have any thing serious, I have also read that many normal people have spots that show up on an MRI>",

    "question": "On a MRI I recently had done (with and without contrast) they found and area, 2mm in size, of increased signaling in the subcortical white matter of the anterior right parietal lobe.They said it was best seen on FLAIR images.I would like to know what this means. Does it mean there is a mass/tumor or a blood clot? They plan on redoing the MRI in 3 months, but that doesn't help me in the mean time.The report says that the finding is nonspecific in nature and can be seen with small vessel ischemic changes; changes from hypertension, diabetes, dermyelinating process as well as others. I know I do not suffer from either diabetes or hypertension and my cholesterol has always been in a good range although I have asked the doctor to repeat it to be sure.Can you give me any idea what they are talking about here? You know when you have no answeres you always think the worst and I have been trying to find out information on different sites but I could really use some help.I would greatly appreciate ANY and ALL information you can give me. If you can't help, I will understand that also.\u00a0\u00a0<'o'>",
