    "question": "I get female odor mostly after intercourse. My husband is uncircumsized but I tell him now not to *** in me, because I notice it more after he does. At times he may not *** in me but I still have an odor after, far as I know he is clean. I just dont know what it could be, I've been tested and was prescribed some antibiotics before the diagnosis came. I wasn't found to have anything unusual for a female. Im wondering if its an allergic reaction to semen or some kind of allergic reaction. We both keep ourselves clean and I am getting irrated with now knowing what this could be. Can someone possibly give me an answer?",
