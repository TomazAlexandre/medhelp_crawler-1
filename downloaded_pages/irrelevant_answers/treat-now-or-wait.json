            "answer": "Hi Bill; I remember you from days past. Your need to undergo treatment is clearly elective. At this point, things like work, family, insurance, and things like that should determine need.If you keep your snoot out of the Budweiser, you might never actually have to undergo treatment. What\u2019s your doctor\u2019s position on this? Your wife\u2019s position? Do you feel you\u2019re insurance will be available in say, 5 or 10 years? Hmm\u2026Bill",

            "answer": "Hello,I have a slightly different viewpoint.\u00a0\u00a0With little liver damage, like you, I delayed treatment for 4 years after I was diagnosed (had HCV for a total of 27 years).\u00a0\u00a0I finally decided to treat (SOC + Alinia) because I felt lousy just about every day.Thankfully I cleared the virus this spring but the HCV took its toll over the years -- I developed latent autoimmune diabetes (LADA) from the HCV infection.\u00a0\u00a0In LADA the overactivated immune system attacks the pancreas and destroys the insulin producing cells.\u00a0\u00a0It's similar to type 1 diabetes and there's no cure.My point is it's not clear what damage the virus and accompanying immune response may inflict on other organs besides the liver.\u00a0\u00a0That said, if I was considering treatment I'd watch the INFORM non-interferon trials closely.Bill1954 is right on when he says the decision to treat involves many factors because it is a life altering event for you and your family.\u00a0\u00a0What I'm saying is there may be consequences in waiting too long.,Kittyface",
