            "answer": "I agree on the fever. He's been on antibiotics and not really improving but just staying about the same. When the vet tried adding a steroid (prednisone) it made him very sick pretty rapidly. I believe that indicates something infectious but we can't figure out what it could be.",

    "question": "I have a 6 yr old mini daschund. He has fluid in his chest and abdomen. (No bacteria in it) he has a constant fever, occasional diarrhea, and a lot of pain near his belly. He won't eat much and is losing weight rapidly. He drinks a ton of water. We've done x-rays, CT scan, scope of his belly, ultrasounds, every lab for urine, blood and stool. Everything is negative....in other words NORMAL! We are so frustrated that no one can find what's wrong with him. Other than the obvious signs he's got a slightly enlarged pancreas. Anyone have any ideas?? I'd be so grateful for some help. He's my baby....I just want to make him better. :0(",
