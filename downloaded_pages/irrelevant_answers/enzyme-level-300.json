            "answer": "You definitely need to find a new doctor. A lot of the symptoms are actually on the list of Hep C symptoms. The problem is that a lot of doctors haven't learned anything about the subject since med school, and then it was very little. If you find a hepatologist that treats a lot of Hep C, he will pay attention to what you are saying.Do you know your genotype? Have you had a biopsy? These are things that you need to know so you can figure out your next steps.I found my hepatologist by Googling them within a 30 mile radius. Found a great one.",

    "question": "After being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, my enzyme level was 300 and the dr. couldn't bring it down. thats when I found out I had hep c. My first indication of a liver disorder was in 1988 The drs. didn't know what hep c was then. So going back 7 years before would make me having hep for about 30 years. Ive been through the enterferon and ribavirin with no success, and have stage 4 psorrhosis. I experience constant anxiety which the drs. refuse to acknowledge, and I have alot of confusion. Sometimes I get lost going down the road and will be 10 miles out of my way before I snap out of it.Iv'e bled for 2 weeks at a time, and my muscles and bones ache all the time. I have a sleeping disorder and sleep 1 out of 3 days. I can't seem to get my drs. interested in my symptoms. They act like nothing is wrong. Should I be worried yet about my condition. Am I dieing yet? Anyone have any feedback on this issue?",
