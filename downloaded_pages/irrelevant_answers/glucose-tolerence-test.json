            "answer": "Hi,the fasting and the 2 hour results are almost the same.\u00a0\u00a0This is known as a flat glucose tolerance test.\u00a0\u00a0A drop of 0.6 likely cannot define hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0It would have been interesting to see what would have happened if the test had been extended.\u00a0\u00a0Whether things stay relatively flat (normal), or whether they drop or rise.Anyway, your result is pretty normal for now.Are you having any concerns that prompted the test to be done?If you are concerned about diabetes, then there are things you can do to reduce chance of having diabetes in future.\u00a0\u00a0these include:-1. Eating low carb diet (cutting sugars, etc).\u00a0\u00a0Paleo approach is typically what works.2. Daily exercise with plenty of physical activity.3. Normalising weight if overweight (paleo approach can also help with this).4. Regular monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0Hba1c which is average 3 month blood sugar is a good tool for this.\u00a0\u00a0Have it measured every 6 - 12 months.\u00a0\u00a0Truly normal is < 5.0 (though the labs give a range up to 5.7).\u00a0\u00a0 If it is rising over time, then you will know that you need to take further efforts to manage things.5. Manage stress and enjoy life.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I had a 2 hr glucose tolerance\u00a0\u00a0test.The results came back in the normal range but seem odd.My fasting glucose was 5.0 mmol/L\u00a0\u00a02 hours after the glucose drink my level was 4.4 mmol/L.Shouldn't the second test be higher than the first?My Dr said I have reactive hypoglycemia. Would this be diagnosed from these results?",
