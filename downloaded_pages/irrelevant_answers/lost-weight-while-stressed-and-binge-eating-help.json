    "question": "on may 1, 2013 i weighed 191 lbs. i joined a weight loss center where i use three of their protein supplement per day and regular grocery store non processed food. the total calories is probably around 1000 - 1100 calories or so. i also used phentermine from my DR and was taking 2 - 3 mile walks per day. i averaged about 2.5 lbs per week loss. i've lost 40 lbs in 4 months. i had a VERY stressful/anxiety period over the past 5 days which caused me to be an emotional wreck, not sleeping well, heart beating fast at times. i cut my phentermine dose in half and totally went off my diet. i was also taking bactrim DS (antibiotic for possible UTI) which had a negative culture (but my urine showed trace blood and leukocytes) and no burning while urinating. just frequent urination which seems better now. DR is not concerned.\u00a0\u00a0i've ate mcdonald's burgers, fries, taco bell, brownies, icecream, apple pie, kielbasa, pork roast, etc. i was eating probably about 2000 - 2500 calories per day and not exercising. i've lost 2 lbs in 5 days eating like this. i'm just about at my goal weight, 151 lbs, and am about to start stabilization then maintenance where they add back 'healthy' foods and up my calories slowly to maintain. but if i lost weight eating like a pig i'm worried i won't stop losing and something could be wrong with me. could extreme stress and binge eating cause one to still lose weight when you are use to eating around 1000 calories? routine annual bloodwork at my DR 3 weeks ago was normal, including thyroid.",
