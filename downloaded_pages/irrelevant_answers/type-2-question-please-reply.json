            "answer": "Let me say first HURRAY for losing 10 pounds!! Keep it up! Well to start out it is normal to have between 10%-15% variation on 2 tests done on the same person at the same time, depending on the meter.\u00a0\u00a0I have done this myself and called the meter company and my doctor when my daughter was first diagnosed.It also depends on what food was eaten just before fasting.\u00a0\u00a0If the meal was higher in fat and protein, the carbohydrates will take longer to break down then a lower fat and protein meal, so having a variation like you explained is normal.\u00a0\u00a0If it was consistent then I would be concerned.I would suggest having your parents talking to the doctor and about having your brother",

    "question": "My little brother who is 15 turning 16 in november , and who is overweight (290 lbs), the doctor said with his height (5'11) he should be 210.He tested his blood glucose once with my dad's glucose testing kit (Dad's a diabetic) after fasting for 8 hours and staying up all night until 7am, his glucose came out at 6.1 mmol on one finger and 6.4 mmol on another finger...Isn't that in the range of having pre-diabetes?Anyway the thing that confuses me is, he tested himself again a month later, and after fasting for 12 hours (and actually sleeping through the night, and not staying up all night), his blood glucose was at 5.5 mmol which i read on the internet is normal.So my question is, is he a prediabetic or not?And I read the fasting should be between 8-12 hours, how can this be an accurate amount of time if the glucose level differs so much between the 8-12 hours....He has recently went to the doctor and got a routine blood test, and the doctor said everything came back normal.Also: He is currently working out regularely and has lost 10 poundsThank youSteve",
