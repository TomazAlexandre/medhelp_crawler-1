            "answer": "Hi, at this it is unlikely to be a joint or bony pain; probably it is related with either neuropathy, muscles or vascular. Did you took some long walk or prolonged standing recently? Did you ever get your vitamin B levels done? Do you smoke?Any history of diabetes? Vitamin B deficiency could also lead to peripheral neuropathy. Try pain killers for 3-4 days along with massage. If no relief is seen, do consult doctor. Please get blood potassium, CK along with vitamin B levels done.Rest as much as\u00a0\u00a0possible.Elevate your leg.Apply ice for up to 15 minutes. Do this 4 times per day, more often for the first few days.Gently stretch and massage cramping muscles.Take over-the-counter pain medications like acetaminophen or ibuprofen.",
