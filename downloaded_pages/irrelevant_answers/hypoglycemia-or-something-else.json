            "answer": "It does sound like reactive hypoglycemia - and the treatment also requires cutting out caffeine as well as cutting out sweets.\u00a0\u00a0Did your doctor order a GTT? If you get a GTT, make sure you get a 6-hour GTT, not the 2-hour GTT used to diagnose diabetes. Do you ever check your blood pressure during these episodes? Some people have hypotension and actually need medication to keep their blood pressure up. You might want to get a BP kit. You can also get a finger-stick glucose kit pretty cheaply and do your own GTT. You have to do it in the morning before eating anything else - check your sugar, then eat enough jellybeans to give you 75 grams of sugar, then check your sugar every hour for six hours - but stop if you get real light-headed and your sugar is low. You could show those results to your doctor.",

    "question": "I've been suffering on and off from what I think is some kind of metabolic disorder or low blood sugar level. I've always gotten the typical irritability/shakiness when hungry ever since I was little, but it seems really out of hand right now. Before a meal/when I'm hungry, I have all the symptoms of hypoglycemia and have to eat NOW to feel better. So I'll eat a snack or my usual meal, but about 30mins to 1hour later I get tired, weak, lightheaded and hot flushes. I think my sugar level peaks and drops too fast, like I'm making too much insulin. It's making me feel horrible every day. Yesterday I tried cutting out all sugar and sticking to proteins/healthier food, and I feel slightly better today, but still lousy. Ive been to see my doctor and he said my blood readings were normal, but I can't think what else could be causing me to feel like this and my father went through exactly the same thing when he was my age. He had a GTT done and it showed he had this sugar peaking too quickly problem.Anyone have a similar story? How long after cutting sugar did it take for you to feel better? Does this sound like reactive hypoglycemia/metabolic problems?",
