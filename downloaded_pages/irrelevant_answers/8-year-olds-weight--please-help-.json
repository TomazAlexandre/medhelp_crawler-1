And it's yummy too. So I think that should help. And going tot he doctors and having them write out a diet for him to follow. Or ever going to a nutrition store. There are many different natural remedy's for things like this. Good luck and keep me updated. You can just message me if you need anything. = ] Good luck-TeaShop",
