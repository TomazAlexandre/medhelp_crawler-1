            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This could be a transient ischemic attack or TIA. TIA or transient ischemic attack is a mini stroke that happens when the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Again this can be due to low oxygen supply to brain where the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off generally due to a spasm of the arteries, or a clot or high blood pressure causing micro leaks in the brain.The symptoms include temporary loss of sensation in any part of the body, black outs, vision loss, tingling, loss of function of a limb etc. It is common in people with high blood pressure, diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, and high cholesterol. Hence all predisposing factors to TIA should be ruled out like polycythemia vera, sickle cell disease, atherosclerosis, diabetes, hyperviscosity syndromes, hypertension etc.Generally this can happen several times before an actual stroke happens. This is a warning sign for the body.Your friend needs a MRI of brain. The itch could be due to paresthesia or abnormal sensation following TIA or nerve compression in upper cervical region or it can be urticaria. Do discuss this with your friend\u2019s doctor. Take care!",
