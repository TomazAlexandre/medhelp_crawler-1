            "answer": "HiThere can be several causes for numbness of the index finger such as Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, Peripheral Neuropathy, Multiple Sclerosis, Peripheral Vascular Disease, Frostbite, Raynaud's Phenomenon and vasculitis.Carpal tunnel syndrome is a common source of hand numbness and pain. It is due to the increased pressure on the median nerve that enters the hand through the carpal tunnel. The causes can be heredity, repetitive movements of the hand over long periods of time, hormonal changes (such as during pregnancy and menopause) or some medical conditions like diabetes, rheumatoid arthritis, and thyroid disorders. Sometimes no cause can be elicited.You should consult your doctor for a proper physical examination which includes several tests to check the functioning of the median nerve in the hand, namely thumb abduction strength test, Durkan carpal tunnel compression test and Phalen maneuver.An X-ray may be required. The diagnosis is usually established by certain electrophysiological tests. Treatment may include a brace or splint worn at night to keep the wrist at rest, NSAIDs such as ibuprofen. Surgery is required if the symptoms are not relieved through conservative treatment. You should consult with your doctor for a proper treatment and diagnosis.Take care",
