            "answer": "Hi,How are you? If the radiologist found no cause for worry in the white spots, then this may be the case. However, check with your doctor for these recent symptoms for proper evaluation. This can indeed be caused by infection, stress, or from hormonal changes. Perimenopause occurs during this time and prior to menopause. It also presents with hot flushes and other symptoms of menopause due to hormonal changes. Dizziness also can be caused by a variety of conditions such as ear or eye conditions, blood pressure and blood sugar issues as well as underlying medical illnesses like anemia or diabetes. Talk to your doctor about this. Take care and do keep us posted.",
