What I learned was priceless, and to this day, I know how to balance foods to maintain sugar and weight.Happy for you!!!!-Shell",

            "answer": "Great on the weight loss. When I had Chemo they told me to gain weight but no one told me how. Finally they sent me to a dietitian. I learned so much from her. She got out her calculator and told me I need 2800 Calories a day which was really hard for me. Then she came up with six things I could have prepared in advance and keep in the fridge so they were easy. I had to eat six times a day. Little meals. Friends prepared these little meals. I am so grateful to her and my friends. I had quit eating all together at that point.I am back to not wanting to eat but I am doing what she said and eating like taking medicine.Alex",
