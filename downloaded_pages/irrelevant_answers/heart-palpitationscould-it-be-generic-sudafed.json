    "question": "I've been taking generic sudafed for 3 days at the maximum dose of 6 per day.\u00a0\u00a0Started noticing heart flutter-feeling yesterday. I'm 47, female, overweight, on no meds other than sudafed.\u00a0\u00a0Have history of 4 surgeries since 2005, 3 for Achilles tendon repair, 1 LAVH & BSO, nonsmoker, rare drinker, no exercise due to foot injury. I have also been experiencing numbness in my feet after standing.\u00a0\u00a0No chest pain or SOB but have dizziness intermittently but not just when changing positions. Started the sudafed because of the dizziness, which is my main symptom of sinus/allergies.\u00a0\u00a0I have had some orthostatic hypotension occasionally after sitting for more than an hour. (I'm a medical transcriptionist and sometimes sit for a hour or more without rising.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be worried about the palpitations?\u00a0\u00a0No history of thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0Last labs 9/06. No high cholesterol etc.\u00a0\u00a0No diabetes but do have father with late onset diabetes, at age 72.Thanks",
