            "answer": "First thing to consider is that while being a vegetarian is great for some it isn't for others, so watch how you feel.\u00a0\u00a0Being diabetic and going vegetarian can be tricky, because you have to avoid the simple carbs and make sure you get your good protein.\u00a0\u00a0If I had diabetes and wanted to do this I'd do a lot of reading first and maybe see a holistic nutritionist to help me do it to make sure I didn't transition to a diet with too many carbs in it to replace the animal protein I had been eating.",

            "answer": "Great advice as always from the above poster.My mother is also diabetic and she gradually became a vegetarian. It has been so very good for her health.

Plant based if the way to go along with the right kinds of carbs.",

            "answer": "Read the book Grain Brain By Dr. David Perlmutter M.D.As for Soy, Asians eat a lot of soy in their diet, Soy formula is a good choice for infants, Soy-containing foods help prevent osteoporosis, Soy is a healthy food for adults, Soy helps improve libido in men.The above about Soy is false. Those who eat large amounts of soy, especially non-fermented soy, have severe hormonal imbalances that are very difficult or impossible to correct without eliminating or drastically reducing soy in the diet. i have seen soy as an ingredient added to tea bags! Give me a break!! Soy is contained in almost 60 percent of grocery store food. It is in vegetable burgers and hot dogs and is a hidden ingredient in many other foods. And don\u2019t forget soy milk.One study found that Chinese ate approximately 2 teaspoons to 2 tablespoons of soy a day. Soy is not eaten in large amounts in Asian countries; rather, it is used as a condiment.Most of the Western food sources contain soy protein isolate, which is a highly processed, devitalized, and toxic food source that needs to be avoided! No newborn child should be fed a soy-based formula.In 1997, researchers reported that infants fed a soy formula ingested a whopping 28 to 47 milligrams (mg) of isoflavones That's an estrogen-like compounds found in soy. The author of this study concluded, \u201cThe daily exposure of infants to isoflavones in soy infant formulas is six- to eleven fold higher on a body-weight basis than the dose that has hormonal effects in adults consuming soy foods. I could go on forever but I think you know how I feel about Soy! Fermented soy Is OK.",

            "answer": "Actually, you're right about B12, though you can get that from spirulina and other fresh water algae, but calcium and iron sources are much better from plants than from animals as they are the most absorbed forms.\u00a0\u00a0Iron is found in beets, parsley, nettles, dandelion greens, well, the list is very long.\u00a0\u00a0The most well absorbed iron supplement is entirely plant based, Floradix.\u00a0\u00a0You don't need a lot of iron, you need iron that's well absorbed.\u00a0\u00a0As for calcium, again, green leafy vegetables, particularly the hard parts such as stems, are the most well absorbed form of calcium and also contain the proper balance of magnesium, which is usually lacking in animal foods.\u00a0\u00a0Most Americans actually consume too much calcium because of the overselling of dairy and too little magnesium; both are essential for proper health and must be in proper electrical balance for both to work.\u00a0\u00a0The only two nutrients hard to get in a well considered vegetarian diet are B12 and methionine.",
