            "answer": "Hi there again,And welcome to the discussion group, Vibrant. Boy, where to begin :o)? There\u2019s a lot to talk about. I\u2019ll try to answer your questions as best I can.Hair tends to thin, rather than fall out in clumps like cancer chemo. Some don\u2019t lose much at all, others thin to maybe 30-40-50%? We\u2019ve had gals in here that have bought wigs, to give you an idea. The women will hopefully chime in later with their thoughts on this matter.The first injection might be a little um\u2026 challenging. Be sure to take a couple of Tylenol (acetaminophen) an hour or so before the first shot, and try to sleep through the first night if you can. I didn\u2019t have too many issues during treatment once I got going, but others have reported getting pretty ill from this stuff. It really varies widely from person to person.Do you know what genotype you are, and perhaps how much fibrosis/scaring of the liver? It\u2019s usually staged F0-F4, with F4 being cirrhosis.I see you are African American? Hopefully, your doctor has counseled you to odds in terms of treatment success, etc? for some reason, a person\u2019s ethnicity plays a role in interferon therapy, and African Americans have a poorer response profile than Asians or Caucasians.Are you being treated by a GI doc, or a hepatologist?And finally, diabetes; are you type 1 or type 2? I\u2019m type 2, and my blood sugar was frilly well managed prior to HCV treatment. I ended up requiring insulin to maintain reasonable blood sugar values, but now that I\u2019m done with therapy, I\u2019m back to managing the diabetes with oral meds, diet and exercise.That\u2019s enough to start with; again, welcome; and feel free to ask questions, etc.Take care\u2014--Bill",

Not bad, girl.Phil Jackson said: \u201cI don\u2019t know we would have won this thing without these fans. That was tough sledding out there tonight.\u201dAn auspicious start to your treatment, so good luck tomorrow. Just hang in, day by day, and ask away.The first four weeks can be a big adjustment, just getting used to and remembering to take your meds properly.\u00a0\u00a0If you're insulin-dependent, you already have good habits set in place, managing your insulin.TTYL and safe driving to your first treatment. If you're having your first injection there, get yourself home afterwards. I didn't for a few hours and felt it hard about six or seven hours after the injection. I totally forgot to take the Tylenol my nurse had told me to take, so I had a whole lot of shaking going on after the first injection but never again. So take the Tylenol if she recommends it. And drink water.Good luck and good night.Susan",

Now that you mention the backache, I remember I had that, too, and it felt like a truck was rolling over my back.People vary in response to the shot. My awful one was the first shot (forgot to take my Tylenol) but after that, I didn't have much of a reaction within the few hours of taking them. Others had no reaction to the first shot and felt hit by them later on in tx (treatment).Some lucky people never felt much of anything but that's unusual, I'd say.Maybe try a hot water bottle or electric heating pad for the backache, alternating with a cold pack.TTYYLSusan",
