    "question": "Hi there.I have an uncle who has retinal detachment. I've been checking out websites and there's seems to be many types of retinal detachment. I would like to clarify which kind of retinal detachment my uncle is having so as to have better knowledge.He's about 65 years old. Has history of Type 2 Diabetes and hypertension. Last week, he noticed some flashes of lights coming from the corner of his left eye. He didn't think anything of it as he thought it was just due ageing process.Then, upon waking up he experienced a sudden loss of vision to his left eye, and feeling of curtains closing too. He says there is no pain in his left eye.Thank you for your help.",
