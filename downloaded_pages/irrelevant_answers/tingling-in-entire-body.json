            "answer": "Hi there.These tingling sensations may very well be due to a spine or spinal cord problem considering that all your tests are normal.\u00a0\u00a0These could be initial manifestations of conditions such as ALS which can progress to weakness of the muscles and fasciculations.\u00a0\u00a0Low calcium or K levels can also explain this, but I think they already have tested these levels.A neurologist may consider doing spine MRI's to determine if there is a problem.\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin B12 levels should also be checked since low levels of these can lead to nerve problems presenting with tingling.Regards.",

            "answer": "Hi,Tingling sensation (paresthesia) in the entire body can be due to a high blood sugar level so it is important to rule out diabetes.Other causes include hypothyroidism, neuropathy due to nerve injury or infection like lymes disease, excessive anxiety or panic attacks. Chronic paresthesias as it is called indicates a serious underlying condition like motor neuron disease, lupus, multiple sclerosis.I would suggest you to please consult a neurologist at your earliest.
