            "answer": "I'm 25 and have been having dizzy/tired spells all my life. I am extremely pale with dark circles around my eyes. It's as if I try and be healthy and cut out suggary drinks and snacks I feel like I'm going to pass out. I had a blood test to see if I was anemic but it came back I was fine. So after some research online I found ways to make myself better. For the tired sluggish feeling avoid processed foods (I promised it makes a difference). Make sure to eat lots of greens and steam them so you get all your vitamins. Try and get as much sleep as possible it makes such a difference and the the most helpful tip is excercise. I hate it but just going jogging twice a week has improved my life so much :) Good luck",

    "question": "Hello all :) I feel absolutely terrible and I believe it has to do with my iron levels being low. I'm 31 female and have heavy menstrual periods. I went to the the doctor with these symptoms , extreme exhaustion and fatigue despite of getting plenty of sleep. Numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, also sometimes my fingers swell to the point where I can't close my fist. Dark circles under my eyes, headaches ,dizziness , shortness of breath and joint pain. She tested my iron levels and said they were normal. My levels was 59 and from what I understand , from reading on line is that a normal iron level for a woman is between 65-170. I really want to feel better anyone else have the symptoms? Even though she said my level was normal, I bought some liquid iron supplements. I think I will feel much better if I can get my levels closer to 100. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",
