            "answer": "Eddie, I am sorry to hear about your wife's situation. Have you posted in the dr. moderated forum. I would suggest that. Also getting multiple drs. opinions and a copy of your records can be a big help. There is constant research that is always evolving, specifically I'm not sure. Are there any kinds of medications that can help slow with disc degeneration? It sounds like almost an autoimmune, or some type of other problem. Does she have any other symptoms. Let me know, until then, I wish you guys the best.",

            "answer": "I agree with Pixiangelj.\u00a0\u00a0She should have her autoimmune, immune, endocrin workup.\u00a0\u00a0Also, recent studies have shown that people with metabolic disorder (diabetes and high cholesterol/triglycerides) tend to have denser bones sometimes and less arthritis and conversely those with low cholesterols and low blood sugars develop more arthritis and possibly disk problems.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore even her thyroid and parathyroid, etcetera can play a role.\u00a0\u00a0Arthritis can cause disk damage and visa-versa.On a positive note, they have started using the new artificial disks in certain areas of the back.\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure of the thoracic area; but I am hearing promising results in some areas of the back from doctors that I know.\u00a0\u00a0A small number of patients are even having two artificial disks inserted at a time.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know if your wife would be a candidate, but I sure would look into it as it sounds like a more promising option than some of the procedures being routinely used now.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

    "question": "my wife has a deteriorating disc disorder. all the disc in her back are going bad. she has had five or six surgeries in the last four to five years. the levels that are failing now are t7-t8. the surgery to fix these levels is very dangers. she has a Intrathecal morphine pump. that we have just about turned as much as we can. now to the question-- is there any thing she can take or do to control the deterioration of the disc in her back? a life time of rodes and screws and surgeries is not much of a life. another question--- is there some thing with steam cell research that could possibly help her?",
