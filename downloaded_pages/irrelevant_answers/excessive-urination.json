    "question": "I urinate 18 to 20 times in a 24 hour period. I keep bringing this up to my doctor, but she thinks it is normal. I wake up 3 to 4 times at night and can not sit through a movie without going 1 or 2 times to the bathroom.My PCP just tells me it is because I drink too much water. Well, it makes sense that whatever goes in has to come out, but I have excessive thirst as well. She told me to stop drinking 3 hours before I go to sleep. When I tried this, I still kept going to the bathroom after I stopped drinking. I woke up dehydrated to the point that my eye lids felt sticky.I was checked for diabetes mellitus. This was done through a 3 month blood glucose test. I also had a urinalysis done. I'm not sure what was tested for. I was only billed less than 3 dollars for test, and it was performed at the doctors office. What type of urinalysis do you think I was tested for? Any suggestions on what other tests I should have done. I was thinking it could be diabetes insipidus.Thanks in advance",
