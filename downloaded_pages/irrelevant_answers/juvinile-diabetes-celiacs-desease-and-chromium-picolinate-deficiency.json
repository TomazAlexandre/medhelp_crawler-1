    "question": "My daughter has been Type 1 8yrs, celiac 3yrs. I have heard that celiac patients may lack chromium as they eat no wheat. How do we know if she is lacking chromium? Would taking chromium picolinate help with insulin absorption? What are the symptoms of low chromium levels, and what are the risks of too much chromium. My pharmacist and diabetic educator says that we need to be careful not to get too much chromium, but could not tell me much more than this. She is 11,and insulin dosages have risen in the last 3 yrs. Part of this is age and growth, but I worry about this, and want to do all we can to keep her healthy and balanced. Does anyone else have any experience with this? Also my husband and other daughter have celiacs, but not diabetes. Could they also be lacking Chromium and should they also be supplimenting?I would appreciate feedback from anyone who is dealing with one or both diseases.",
