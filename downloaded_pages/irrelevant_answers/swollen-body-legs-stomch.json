            "answer": "Hi,How is he doing now?What are the other symptoms he is having?Leg swelling can be due to either abnormal cardiac functioning or localized causes. The most common systemic diseases that are associated with edema involve the heart, liver, and kidneys. In these diseases, edema occurs primarily because of the body's retention of too much salt (which is the chemical compound sodium chloride). The excess salt holds excess water in the interstitial tissue spaces, where the retained surplus of fluid is recognized as edema. The most common local conditions that cause edema are varicose veins and thrombophlebitis (a blood clot with inflammation of the veins) of the deep veins of the legs.Does your husband have jaundice? Can you see any bluishness on the abdomen? Is he alcoholic?Hope this helps?Bye.",
