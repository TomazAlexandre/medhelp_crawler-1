    "question": "I am thirty weeks as of today; however, I am starting to feel little to no movement over the past 2 or 3 days. Since about 16 weeks, I have felt her almost non-stop. I have gained about 45 pounds so far, so much that my doctor had me really watch what I eat lately, and on top of that, I have been battling a cold. No gestational diabetes though. I'm not sure if it's me being sick or changing my diet, but do you think I should be worried? I also have a fetal doppler I used today and her heart beat seems fine. I guess I'm just a worrying first time momma to be since she is hardly moving the past few days.",
