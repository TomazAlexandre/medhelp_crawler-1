            "answer": "Hi Janaki,How is your husband? Proteinuria describes a condition in which urine contains an abnormal amount of protein. Proteins from the blood can escape into the urine when the filters of the kidney, called glomeruli, are damaged. Inflammation in the glomeruli is called glomerulonephritis, or simply nephritis. This\u00a0\u00a0may be due to medical conditions such as\u00a0\u00a0diabetes, hypertension, and other forms of kidney diseases.Because the protein has left the body, the blood can no longer soak up enough fluid and\u00a0\u00a0swelling in the hands, feet, abdomen, or face may be observed such as seen in your husband. If your husband has persistent proteinuria\u00a0\u00a0additional tests must be done\u00a0\u00a0to evaluate his kidney function. In addition to blood glucose and blood pressure control, the National Kidney Foundation recommends restricting dietary salt and protein. The extent of the damage to the kidneys must first be evaluated by his doctors. An oral steroid may be prescribed for his proteinuria proteinuria.The side effects of steroids may include adrenal suppression,\u00a0\u00a0insomnia, euphoria glaucoma and cataract formation, fatigue or weakness, abdominal pain, infections, pain in the hips or shoulders, osteoporosis, occurrence of acne and sleeplessness.
