I made that mistake and because i was already overweight it put extra strain on my body. Eat extra healthy if you can and try to eat a balanced diet.

            "answer": "Eat right, stay active and rock those maternity pants early. I slipped right into those bad boys at ten weeks and it was over. They are comfy, cute and made for a big belly!

Especially be good about the eating right because we are at a higher risk for early diagnosis of gestational diabetes and that is no fun.",
