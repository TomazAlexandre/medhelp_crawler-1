            "answer": "Hi,Are there any headaches associated with this?Your history in the army may be significant here? Was there any previous history of being exposed to loud noises?Any previous trauma or injury to the head?I suggest that you seek consult wih a neurologist. The symptoms of numbness and forgetfulness may be attributed readily to a nerve related cause however, forgetfulness may need to be further evaluated. You need a complete neurological examination and a mental status examination to test memory and cognition.At this point,there may be several differentials such as a cervicogenic or spine related headache. However, other conditions have to be ruled out first.A CT scan may rule out an underlying intracranial involvement. This has to be importantly exluded first.Do you have diabetes , hypertension or a kidney disorder?",
