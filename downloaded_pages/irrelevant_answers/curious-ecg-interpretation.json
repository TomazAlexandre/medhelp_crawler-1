Also, in order to properly interpret, one would need the actual sheet as there are measurements that can be made from those graphs that go into making a diagnosis.If you need another opinion I would seek the advise of another cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a02nd opinions are always good.",

            "answer": "You can look online to get a feeling for how normal ecg compares with damaged muscle, but it really gets back to who you can trust to read and interpret your ecg. I am not a doctor.The words \"probable infarct\" would raise a bit of a red flag for me here, especially if you are having chest pain. However, there's also a word of caution on the ecg: there is an artifact, and they don't say what it is.Have you had a more recent ecg, and how was that? Also, I notice that you don't mention the results of your stress test, nor whether they gave you an echo. However, I agree with the previous post. A second opinion is good.",

    "question": "Hello all,I am a Male age 42, with type 2 diabetes currently on insulin treatment(Humulin U500) In 2008 I was diagnosed with Cor Pulmonale after an extended period of untreated sleep apnea. Since then I have been experiencing the following symptoms:Intermittent chest painDyspnea (on even light exertion and lying down)Nagging cough, Sore, raw feeling lungs, pain on taking a full deep breathEdema in the feet, legs, hands, arms, torsoSkeletal muscle pains after a short time of use, i.e. walking/standing/reaching up for something/holding a tablet/book etcGeneralized Cramps in skeletal musclesRecently, I switched healthcare providers and had an ECG done(picture attached). My doctor at the time said it was fine but later I was sent to a cardiologist who ordered a Dobutamine stress test, and he said everything looked ok, and he didn't *think* I had Cor Pulmonale, but he didn't seem 100% sure. He said he could go ahead and order more invasive tests like a Cardiac catheterization, but he didn't think it was worth it.What bothers me is this ECG which was taken a couple of months before the stress test. My PCP says it doesn't look quite right to her.Also, My CK-MB showed:Total CK\t154CK-MB\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09.9 ng/mLRelative Index 6%I understand the CK-MB can be elevated from normal muscle damage, but my Troponin level was never checked to rule that out.So I guess I'm asking, how abnormal does this ECG seem?",
