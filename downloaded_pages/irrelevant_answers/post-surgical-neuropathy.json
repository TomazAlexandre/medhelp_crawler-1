            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?I think more than a reaction to anesthetic medication during surgery; it looks like there is some peripheral neuropathy.This could be due to nutritional deficiency, VitB12 deficiency, dehydration, diabetes, and prediabetes.I think you should start taking Vitamin supplements.Alternatively, you can consult a physician and discuss regarding testing regarding diabetes.Hope this helps.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,The symptoms explained by you probably reflects nerve pathology.There is no relation to this pain with the anaesthetic\u00a0\u00a0drug. If it was to happen, it should have been within a day to two post surgery.The problem could be sometime of peripheral neuropathy which, again can be due to numerous causes. This can be sorted by taking multivitamin supplements both as drug and as diet.Seek your surgeon as well as physician opinion.",

            "answer": "Here it is nearly three years after your posting &\u00a0\u00a0I have the same basic question. I've had type-2 diabetes for over ten years and never had symptoms of diabetic neuropathy until spending eight days in post-surgery recovery for emergency (is there any other kind?) sigmoid colectomy. I saw my primarycare physician two days after release from hospital; he advised wait & see; now two weeks later this pain is negligible. Hopefully it will stay away from now on.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0And three years later: how are you? the neuropathy - did that stay or go or what? & generally: full recovery from the surgery itself?",

            "answer": "Post surgical neuropathy is a well documented but little thought of complication of vitamin B12 insufficiency and the use of nitrous oxide which inactivates the active metabolite. It can cause megaloblastic anemia and myelopathy and is an occupational health hazard for theatre staff. Unfortunate as the blood levels are easily tested pre-op so it is easily prevented. http://bja.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/6/812.full",

    "question": "I had a sigmoid colectomy 4 weeks ago. As soon as I stopped taking opiates for pain (about 2 weeks after surgery) I developed skin sensitivity, burning and sharp pains, numbness, tingling in my feet(severe), lower legs(numbness) and hands(minimal but definitely there).Blood work (so far) shows nothing. Previously I had some pain on the bottoms of my feet when walking a lot and some minor sunburn-type sensitivity on the tops of my feet sometimes. Nothing that got in the way of daily living. This is different.\u00a0\u00a0It interferes with my sleep since anything touching my feet wakes me up. Can't get comforatble due to the pain. Minor relief with tylenol or ibuprophen. Just takes the edge off.Doctor suggested it might be a reaction to the anesthetic during surgery.Has anyone heard of this?Opinions please.Thanks, gsc",
