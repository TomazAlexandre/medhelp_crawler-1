            "answer": "Hey! I'm 31 & pregnant with my first aswell. I'm not sure if things are different here in the UK (I can sense an American accent in your typing) but I think here it's more if you're over 35. I got a test for Downs Syndrome at my first scan (part of my blood test) which apparently the older u are the higher the risk, but I don't know if everyone gets that?I'm not doing any thing you aren't doing. Depending on your race, they may check for sickle cell anaemia risk. If you're overweight or hot duabetes in the family, they may check u for gestational diabetes, but as far as I know, that isn't age-related.I think you're doing just fine from what you've said. Hope it all goes well :-)",
