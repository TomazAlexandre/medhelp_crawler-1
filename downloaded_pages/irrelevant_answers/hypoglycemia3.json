            "answer": "In situations of pre-diabetes, we often hear that people have bouts of hypoglycemia. This happens when the glucose levels start to rise too much and the person's body over-compensates by producing too much insulin. Many hypoglycemic folks eventually do end up being diabetic after the pancreas wears itself out and is no longer able to lower those glucose levels. Most doctors recommend a diet fairly low in carbohydrates to avoid stimulating the already over-active pancreas. It is also recommended that the carbs you eat be high in fiber (complex carbohydrates) so as to slow the digestion and absorption and not stimulate the production of insulin as much as foods with simple sugars.",

            "answer": "Ask your doctor to look up your specific brand of IVIG---some of them have different types of sugars that might interfere with glucose readings---this potentially could cause a reading that is falsely high and therefore insulin dose is increased higher than needed pushing your real sugar value lower.",

    "question": "Hi - I'm new here. I have pre-diabetes (about 2 years now) and have autoimmune degenerative neuropathy (CIDP for 26 years) unrelated to diabetes. I am not overweight, and am 32 years of age. My question is: does inflammation in the nervous system cause alterations in glucose metabolism? I'm currently having multiple daily bouts of hypoglycemia - my doctors can't/won't answer my question. I'm taking IVIG, Imuran and Ultram - no steroids or antidiabetics. I'm very well aware of the hypoglycemia (I feel symptomatic at BS of 80 & less)any answers would be welocome. Thank you msKiky",
