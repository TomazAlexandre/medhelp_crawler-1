I didn't have to fast and although the glucose stuff was still gross, they had me drink the stuff and then do my usual appointment and then take blood so at least I didn't end up sitting there doing nothing while i waited.",

I would say if you havent heard anything yet you probably are good. not sure how your dr does it, but i would think if it came back possitive they would have let you know right away.Yea and i agree on the whole \"orange soda\" concept. they always told me thats what it was like....ugh!\u00a0\u00a0there was one point of time i enjoyed orange soda, anymore its not so appealing!",
