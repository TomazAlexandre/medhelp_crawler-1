            "answer": "Hi, I don't know the answer to your question, but I can empathise. For years, I had terrible troubles in a workplace with a set of symptoms that are very hard to describe. Eventually it became clear that flourescent light was the major issue. I work under natural light now, thank goodness.All I would say is that you should keep in mind that a workplace is an environment with many possible elements that may cause you problems, but not others. To this day, I find it difficult to believe so many people can spend 8 hours a day under flourescent lighting. I struggle to manage two hours now and then. However, it seems most people aren't bothered by it. There could be some allergin. To take one example, is there any new furniture, carpet etc around? This can give of chemicals, some of which I believe can trigger allergies (hopefully someone can give better info than me on this). I would experiment a bit. If you leave the workplace for a while and come back are your symptoms better? Do you spend most time in one location, or do you move around? Can you try to pinpoint which location(s) are worst?Best of luck with it.",

            "answer": "There is some thing called occupational asthma.\u00a0\u00a0You could experience asthma triggered by something in your work place.It sounds like Symbicort is not working for you.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to ask your doctor about trying Advair or Dulera.\u00a0\u00a0Dulera seems to work the best for me.\u00a0\u00a0Symbicort does absolutely nothing for me.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone metabolizies medications defferently, so Symbicort may not be the best choice for you.You do want to get off the prednisone as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0DO NOT just stop taking it.\u00a0\u00a0That can cause serious problems.\u00a0\u00a0Long term use of pred will cause a host of problems from diabetes, liver and heart damage, adrenal problems...\u00a0\u00a0It is not a medication that should be used as a maintenance medication.I hope that helps you some.Take care and feel better.God bless.",
