    "question": "Hi! After a really bad SVT where I ended up in A& E, my Dr perscribed Labetalol 400mg per day.I have had three bad SVT's over 5 years, which lasted between 2 and 3 hours, but hardly anything in between, but since taking the meds for a month I have had a few very small SVT's which last only seconds and stop when I hold my noise and blow.Would the meds be making this happen.",
