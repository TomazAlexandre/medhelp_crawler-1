            "answer": "Hi Trudie. Thank you so much for the reply. It's reassuring to know that I'm not alone. When I was first diagnosed with SLE, I was immediately prescribed plaquenil and a low dose prednisone. I was a user of both medications for 10 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0A year or two back, the Rheumo which I had seen, took me off of the plaquenil and not long after that my primary took me off the prednisone due to testing negative on my ANA count. I therefore, had managed my pain, inflammation and flare ups with naproxen, which does save my life. Several years back, I learned of Lyrica. Wonder drug for about 2 yrs then, I started showing some side effects or what I believed to be side effects. I haven't been off of it for too long, and have seemed to being doing ok, until recently when these other symptoms arose. It's baffling. I had blood work today to check my glucose levels and to rule out a possible kidney infection/uti. I pray the results are nothing more than my preexisiting conditions. If these new symptoms are related to SLE and fibro, I may consider giving Lyrica another try. In the meantime, have you heard of Savella?\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, this is another form of Lyrica. So how are you feeling?\u00a0\u00a0You appear to have a control on your illnesses, which I'm happy to hear. You're an inspiration, thank you :) oh and thank you for the Remeron tip. I'll be sure to talk to my Dr. about it. The crap I take now, just seems to make the depression worse.",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 48 yr.old female living with SLE. fibromyalgia. celiatic sprue, and arthritis. All of course resulting in depression and sleep disturbances. In addition to the sunburn rash I have on a daily basis to my chest, I have just recently been diagnosed with a skin disease known as granuloma annulare, cause unknown, but\u00a0\u00a0possibly related to a diabetic rash.\u00a0\u00a0I also have had a reoccurring out break of extreme itches from head to toe. I'm also experiencing nausea, along with\u00a0\u00a0tingling and burning sensations to my toes and fingers. My concern is if this can be diabetes or a kidney related condition or just symptoms resulting from my preexisting conditions? Thank you :)",
