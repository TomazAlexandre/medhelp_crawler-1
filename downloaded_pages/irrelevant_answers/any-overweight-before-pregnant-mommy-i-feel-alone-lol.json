I use 132 units daily of insulin and I was using Metformin (Glucophage) but I quit taking it because it was not making a difference on my blood sugar levels and I think its better for the baby to have less medications. Thank you for your support!",

            "answer": "I'm overweight. At my first visit, my doctor told me to not gain ANY weight this entire pregnancy. So basically I had to LOSE weight as I gained baby. I was like lol ummmmmm fat chance. But I'm 22 weeks now and have lost weight. I weigh less halfway through than I did pre-pregnancy. Idk how I did it. Just smaller meals (to avoid puking) and healthier choices I guess. I have a normal low risk pregnancy but SOLELY because I'm overweight, it's listed as a pregnancy complication. I'm \"more likely\" to have preeclampsia or gestational diabetes or need a c-section. But the good news is, you will be monitored extra closely! Things are actually less likely to go wrong and any issues will be caught before it becomes a problem. Try to think of it that way. :)",
