            "answer": "Welcome to the forum. Congrats on being pregnanat (if you are happy about it) Did you have a biopsy that placed you at stage 4? how did your doc determine that? There is about a 5% chance of passing Hep c onto your baby, fairly low chance, but it happens. You can't treat while you are pregnant as I believe the treatment can cause birth defects. You wouldn't want to anyway.- Dave",

            "answer": "Wow! I thought I was the only person who had a baby at 44. That was 11 years ago, and that was my easiest of 3 pregnancies... no gestational diabetes... no water retention... no morning sickness. My daughter is fine. I didn't know I had hep c at the time... just found out and I have been infected over 25 years.I would get treated as soon as possible after you have your baby though because having teenagers in the house when you are in your mid 50s is a challenge! Need lots of energy!Hope things go well for you!Diane",
