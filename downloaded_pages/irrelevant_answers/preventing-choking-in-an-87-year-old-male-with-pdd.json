It would be worthwhile to see a neurologist who is a movement disorders specialist who has a full understanding of how to treat dysphagia. Then from there they could provide some form of rehabilitation and follow up. There are agencies that specifically assist people with Parkinson's as well.",

    "question": "Hi everyone. I'm new here. My dear FIL is 87 and has PDD. My MIL told me the other day that he choked on his dinner. This is not the first time. She pounded on his back and he ended up fine, but I'm scared (and so is she) that it will happen again. She's been cutting his food up real tiny for him for a while now, but he still choked. At a friends advice, I told her to ask his Family Doctor for a swallow test. He has his check up next week and unfortunately, I can't be at this one (I usually attend too per my MIL's request,,,,she's 80, but very young for her age). I'm afraid he will fail the swallow test, and I want to bring some type of food puree machine to them. Anyone know which would be best? I've looked at many, but seems most don't look like they'd do a good job on meats. Also, any other advice for us in how to help him not choke? His dementia is severe, and he is wheelchair bound. He also has a hiatial hernia and type 2 diabetes. I want to help them as much as I can, but I also live an hour and a half away and am working full time and have teenage kids. Thanks for any tips/advice you can offer.Kara",
