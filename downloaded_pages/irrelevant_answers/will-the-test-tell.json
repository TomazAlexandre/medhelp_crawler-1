            "answer": "Thank you so much. I seen my PCP today and she sent me back to the ER for a CT scan of my chest which check..ed out fine\u00a0\u00a0I had 3 nebulizer tr.eatments in a row and got my breath back but My diastolic was 117 . I have never given up on anything but it gets so confusing at times.\u00a0\u00a0I told them about my skin burning sensations and they said sounds like neuropthy or suger but when I gave them all my symptoms they did not want to hear about the neck pain or suger symptoms. They only wanted to hear about my chest being on comfortable and my breathing problems which were obvious.\u00a0\u00a0 I feel like the boy who cried wolfe and very embarrassed. I know I will breath good for a short while anyway.\u00a0\u00a0Also I have been on a beta blocker for 3 years as it is the only bp med that works and my pcp thinks that could be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0I am working on losing weight and recent ly lost 14 pounds for no reason.\u00a0\u00a0 ....\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to sound like a\u00a0\u00a0victum or like I am having a pity party. I just got home and feel very down as I feel like I cannot express myself correctly and they do not seem to consider the person as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for your well thought out answer! I will re reed it and pay attention.\u00a0\u00a0I do not feel like much of a man anymore as I cannot do the things I have always done.",

I was told I have pre type two some years back and recently I am making changes in what I eat etc. I am 53 and weigh 363 as I said in my last post. Anyway I recently found out my testostorne levels were also very low. I am being treated for it. Your suggestion about nitro is something I will talk to them about. Today I had chills and was light headed for a while and went back to bed. I felt like my insides were shaking. (NOT A PANIC ATTACK).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway I had two pains on the left side of my chest andpain in my left arm.\u00a0\u00a0I so hate the idea of going to the Er.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I will get back to you... got to go and thank you again.",
