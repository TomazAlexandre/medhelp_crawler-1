            "answer": "Personally, when I hear something like numbness in balls of feet only, I don't think of a central cause like MS. I would first think of problems with posture, exercise, shoes, or some type of foot problem like plantar faciitis. But try posting your question for the forum doctor on this site; I did that and the doctor answered the next day. Good luck.",

    "question": "I have severe numbness in the ball of each foot. Toes are barely affected. I have had this for over 3 years and seems to slowly be getting worse. I have also had problems with involuntary muscle twitches in my eyelids, arms and legs over the same period. My doc has done blood work and ruled out diabetes. He suggested magnesium and calcium supplements and increased water intake. This has helped somewhat with the twitching, but the foot numbness has remained constant.Is this peripheral neuropathy? MS?Thank you for you help.",
