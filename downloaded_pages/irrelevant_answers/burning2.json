            "answer": "Hi Geanie,You have nice and lovely name.How old are you? Where was impact of accident? Was it lower back or over the thighs?Did you consult any doctor then? What was the imaging study been done?I think it is your lower back causing problems. I think it might from your injury during accident causing concerns. It can happen anytime after any accident.I feel you should consult an orthopaedician at earliest and do imaging studies.What are your other associated symptoms?It can also be due some vitamin B12 deficiency, dehydration, or diabetes.I think you should also consult physician to rule diabetes status.Keep me informed about your disease progression, your decision and your health in general.Bye.",
