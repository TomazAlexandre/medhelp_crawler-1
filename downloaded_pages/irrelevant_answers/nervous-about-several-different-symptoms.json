    "question": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0First a little history...I am a 33 year old woman in pretty good health - no major problems in my medical history (however I am overweight).\u00a0\u00a0I gave birth to triplets 8 and a half months ago.\u00a0\u00a0About 6 months ago I started taking Zoloft.\u00a0\u00a0I also had Mirena inserted about 5 months ago and removed a couple of weeks ago.Starting about 2 months ago I started to have a lot of tingling sensations (like pins and needles) in my hands and feet.\u00a0\u00a0The most disturbing tingling was in my abdomen (almost felt like I was wearing a girdle on the inside).\u00a0\u00a0The tingling in my hands and feet is there all the time and I also have radiating numbness from my hips to my feet.\u00a0\u00a0On top of that I m having trouble with my short term memory (for example I'll start a task at work and forget what I was doing), I'm having problems focusing, and I have gained 25 pounds in the last 2 months (all the while trying to LOSE weight - exercising and eating pretty well).\u00a0\u00a0I am very concerned and of course worst case scenarios have started playing in my head.\u00a0\u00a0Can you give me your opinion on what the issue(s) might be?Thank you very much.",
