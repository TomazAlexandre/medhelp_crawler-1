            "answer": "I had my lap band surgery June 29, so I'm 8 days post-op. I've lost 19 pounds since I started my pre-op diet on June 15. I'm into the 2nd phase of the diet and am tolerating everything well. I am a little discouraged that I feel so hungry all the time. Anyone know how long that lasts? I'm afraid I'll eat too fast or too much trying to get rid of the hunger, which would kind of defeat the purpose of all this.I'm using the weight tracker here and was glad to find this community also.A few facts - I'm 54, married 35 years and have 3 grown kids and 2 grandkids. I don't work right now because I was having too much trouble getting to work everyday. I have high blood pressure, diabetes and severe osteo-arthritis in my knees. My goal for having this surgery is to get off my meds, go spend the day at Disneyland with my grandsons and be more active.",
