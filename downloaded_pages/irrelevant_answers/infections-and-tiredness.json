            "answer": "I am not a physician, but the mom of type 1 diabetic and the daughter of a type2 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0 I would suggest you go for a second opinion, it sounds like you are seeing a physician that does not know diabetes well. , I would suggest you see an endocronolist (a doctor that specializes in diabetes.).\u00a0\u00a0 I am saying this for several reasons.First of all if you are still thirsty, loosing weight and having ketones, you are not in control.\u00a0\u00a0 Ketones happen when your blood sugar is too high and your body is breaking down fat to get you energy, therefore you are loosing weight.\u00a0\u00a0 These are all signs that you are NOT in control. and heading for ketonacidocisis. (Ketonacidosis can lead to serious problems such as coma is the levels are too high for too long.)\u00a0\u00a0 You should remember that when you check your blood it is only for that moment in time, most people should check prior to eating and 2 hours after eating.I would suggest that you make an appt ASAP to see an endocrinologist, if you have insurance I would call your insurance company and ask them, for and endo endocronogist in your plan, or your local hospital.I would also\u00a0\u00a0suggest asking about going on an insulin pump, once you get rid of the ketones and under control.You are right this is not normal; even though everyone is unique this is not normal.\u00a0\u00a0 There is a normal phase called a Honeymoon phase, but that is where your pancreas is still producing insulin and you would be having lower blood sugars and no ketones.Please check back and let us know how things are going. Hope this helpsHaving infections will raise your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0So will medications.",

            "answer": "I'm a volunteer here and I've had Type I Diabetes since I was 18 (over 10 years). As far as having all the symptoms that you mentioned -it isn't really \"normal\" per se to be experiencing those once you're under the care of an endocrinologist. However, since you have been diabetic less than a year (and it definitely changes your life), you may need time to cope with everything and get things under control. I, unfortunately, did not get my sugar under control for the first 6 years or so, but that's because I was not seeing a specialist, just bouncing from one internist to the other. Once I got my diabetes team together (endo, CDE & dietitian) and had attended a few meetings for diabetics (held by my team)I started to get a better grip on things. The adjustment period is different for everyone but as long as you're confident in your doctor and do everything you're supposed to things will get better. Ask to have a blood test done to eliminate any other factors that may be causing your symptoms, including any thyroid problems, anemia, etc. Also, get involved in the management of your diabetes - subscribe to diabetes magazines (I learned a lot from them), search some related articles in your library or in an online database (like pubmed.gov), and see if you can join a diabetes support group in your area (most hospitals offer one, as well as diabetes classes taught by a CDE -I know: I took one and I work in a hospital :)) Don't wait to check things out and always ask questions. When I first saw my endo I came into my appointment with a list of about 50 questions (seriously) pertaining specifically to my situation. Ask questions, do research and take care of yourself! Good luck!",

            "answer": "It might be worth asking your doctor to check for other diseases (for example, celiac disease, Crohn's disease, etc.) that could be causing the weight loss and symptoms even in the setting of good glucose control. Just a thought.",

            "answer": "I remember when I first tried to get a pump the doctor basically said once your in control we can do that.\u00a0\u00a0Well I did get a pump(eventually 4years latter after very brittle uncontrolled type 1 diabetes for 10 years) and now I have way better control.\u00a0\u00a0I mean the pump is what I needed.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors keeping it away for whatever reason kinda confuses me now.\u00a0\u00a0What if they would of let me have it as soon as I got my medicare?\u00a0\u00a0Who knows.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe the complications wouldn't be so far advanced now.\u00a0\u00a0A1c before pump 13+ after pump 8.5 and below.I understand the reason they want people to be in control is that it shows that you are able to do what needs to be done with the added responsibility of a pump.\u00a0\u00a0Me on the other hand, I am very technology friendly.\u00a0\u00a0The pump also fit in with my \"OCD\".\u00a0\u00a0Knew there was a reason God gave me obsessive compulsive disorder lol.I also got type one diabetes when I was 22.\u00a0\u00a0I was almost blind also and lost major weight(6'6\" 155 pounds).\u00a0\u00a0After going on insulin I did gain weight but that might have been from me quitting smoking.\u00a0\u00a0Now at 38 I am so messed up that I am on disability.\u00a0\u00a0And the pain from the neuropathy is so bad.\u00a0\u00a0It is unbearable.\u00a0\u00a0Thank God for his gift of medication to treat the pain(without it I would be insane).One thing for sure is ketones are bad and you need to be in the hospital or something.\u00a0\u00a0What you are describing would put you in a hospital in the states(Well, If you have a competent doctor that is).Also, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease with the resultant hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0This as diabetes will cause fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Don't forget to mention it to your Doctor.I am not a Doctor or in the medical field in any capacity.\u00a0\u00a0I have Had type 1 diabetes for 16 years.\u00a0\u00a0So hopefully my babbling will help you.-Mark Bean",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes 7 months ago at the age of 22.\u00a0\u00a0Things have not gotten better since I was diagnosed, in most cases actually things have gotten worse.\u00a0\u00a0Sure I can see again, but the extreme thirst, weight loss (from 180lbs to 125lbs since diagnosis), tiredness, infections....you name the symptom, I have it.\u00a0\u00a0The strange thing is my blood sugar is normal most of the time because I am checking and doing my insulin shots whenever I need them.\u00a0\u00a0I'm beginning to feel a little frightened because I can't control my weight, my ketones are through the roof, i'm always tired and have one or more infections.\u00a0\u00a0I see my doctor often too, she's not sure what's going on.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a normal first year type 1 problem, or should I try harder to get explanations on what's doing this?",
