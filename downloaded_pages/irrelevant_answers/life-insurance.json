            "answer": "Life insurance IS possible, but it is pricey and he has to be in wonderful condition when it is purchased -- my husband and I were able to find a life insurance policy for me when I was in my early 30's (diagnosed at age 12). Things may well change by the time your son is old enough to want to purchase life insurance, and diabetes may not automatically disqualify him if progress has been made so that type 1 diabetics are being proved to live long and healthy lives by then.",

            "answer": "FYI -- Gerber Life (Grow Up Plan) WILL NOT insure children with diabetes. I had never thought to get my son life insurance until he was diagnosed at 9 years old. Then all the things he couldn't do in life and all the challenges he would face hit me at once. Health and life insurance when he reaches adulthood being just two of the many concerns. I filled out a Gerber Life application in hopes he might qualify and he was flatly denied because of his type 1 diabetes. I wish now I had gotten him a policy when he was \"healthy.\"",

    "question": "My husband and I are already seeing that my two year old son will have a hard time being approved for insurance.Is there a special policy out there for youngsters with diabetes? Its a shame they are diagnosed so young too young to have did anything to themselves to cause this.\u00a0\u00a0They dont smoke, drink etc.not fair to them.My husband applied for another insurance policy since recently purchasing a motorcycle and our son was turned down on the Child rider policy.Can insurance companies deny him if he has an existing policy prior to diagnosis?I hope there is a cure before he hits adult hood i am just thinking future need for him if one days he marries etc.",
