            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Generally bad odor is due to infection, mainly by E coli. This can be diagnosed by urine culture. Strong fruity odor is due to uncontrolled diabetes. Interestingly urine odor changes in menopause too. Urinary bladder infection and kidney infections do produce strong smelling urine. Another reason is dehydration. Strong ammonia smell is due to protein breakdown.Please discuss this with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
