            "answer": "Hello,It can be folliculitis,dermatitis (atopic, contact, allergic), heat rash or excessive sweating causing sweat dermatitis.You may try calamine lotion on the rash. You should also maintain hygiene and try to keep the area clean and dry, wear loose-fitting cotton clothing. Also use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove.Avoid deodorant / cosmetics. You can also use a barrier cream with zinc oxide paste or petroleum jelly or a thick moisturizing cream applied directly to wet skin after bathing.If the rash persists then it will be best to get it evaluated from a dermatologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

If I miss a day of treatment out, it gets worse.I have cut down a lot on sugar and sugary foods and have recently started to drink live yogurt.\u00a0\u00a0I have also recently started to take multivitamins, magnesium, zinc and B12 and my skin is improving - slowly.Make sure you use a non biological washing solution to wash your clothes.\u00a0\u00a0Don't use normal soaps as this can dry and aggravat the condition.\u00a0\u00a0 Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your reply. I was scared no one would get back to me. I have been going to the dermatologist and they just keep prescribing medications. The meds don't even help that much. In the beginning they did and stopped the itchiness from time to time, but I think my body over powered the medication or something because it doesn't help anymore. And actually within the last two days, a new rash started to pop up. There are these little tiny red bumps now developing by the sores. They burn really bad. The new rash looks like eczema a little but I am not a doctor and don't want to self-diagnose. I'm thinking about just trying to go to a new dermatologist, perhaps?",

            "answer": "They tested for thyroid problems but that came up negative. I took Accutane about 2 and a half years ago and have heard of a few cases from people getting diabetes from it along with the gluten allergies. That was my first guess at what I had. Now I'm not so sure. My dermatologist hasn't done much except 4 blood tests and a biopsy. He's also prescribed plenty of medication but it just doesn't seem to do the trick. I'm going to start looking for other dermatologists. Also, a new rash has developed within the last 2 days and it's even more itchy than the other rash. I have these tiny red bumps that are appearing on the surface of my skin but in little patches. It burns really bad no matter what clothing I choose to wear. Thank you for your reply, though. I'll definitely have to try some of the things you are doing.",

I just purchased dead sea bath salts and tea tree soap from Whole Foods. I'm also going to start changing up my diet quite a bit. I am hoping it will all help cease the itchiness. I truly believe it's an allergic reaction, I am just not sure to what? Thank you for the advice, though!",

    "question": "I've had this skin condition for ten months now and don't know what it is. My skin is itchy almost 24/7. I've been to the dermatologist and they claim I had an allergic reaction to something so bad that it damaged my nerves therefore causing my skin to itch. I've been taking pills and using creams prescribed by them but they don't seem to be helping. I have these weird scab like things all over my arms and legs, some on my back and a couple on my butt cheeks. I cannot take a shower without them hurting, even if the water is cold. When I scratch them, they tend to bleed. (This happens quite often.) Also, throughout the day at random times, little red dots will appear on my skin but they don't itch at all. Unless, some stay and develop into the scab things. I've even woken up in the middle of the night from itching so bad. Even wearing jeans worsens the itchiness. Summer is right around the corner and I honestly don't know what to do next. I've tried researching things but I can't seem to find a perfect match to anything. It's continually getting worse, too. I just want to know what it could be. Any suggestions? Please help. ):",
