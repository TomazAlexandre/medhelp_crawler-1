            "answer": "Hi Kariberi. You've come to the right forum. All your symptoms point to diabetes and you're doing the right thing by seeking medical help. Discuss in length with your doctor the following tests:CBC (complete blood check)Hepatitis A, B, and CFasting glucoseHemoglobin A1cYou may wonder about the Hepatitis tests but this disease can be transferred to humans by food and/or contact with blood. It can lay dormant in your body for over 20 years before it surfaces. Thee are vaccines available for Hep A and B but for C. The latter is life threatening but if caught early can be treated.Go here to read and understand these tests so you have the ability to discuss them properly with the doctor. Its an easy read and not filled with heavy medical terminology but has important terms that your doctor will quickly recognize.http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/encyclopedia_A-Ag.htm",

            "answer": "Apologize for the typos. Correction to \"Thee are vaccines available for Hep A and B but for C.\" It should read there are vaccines available for Hep A and B but NOT for Hep C.Both diabetes and Hepatitis can cause fatigue and weezyness (lightheaded) and excessive hunger. Its in your best interest to get tested for both.",

    "question": "I am not sure if this has anything to do with Diabetes but I wasn't real sure where to post this question. Lately I have gotten very weak and shaky randomly. For instance, this morning I had some cereal before I feft for work (about 8 am) and on the way to work I had a coffee drink. At about 10 am I started feeling very weak and very shaky...I felt extremely hungry so I ate the sandwich I had brought for lunch. It helped the shaky and weak feeling for the most part but now I feel very fatigued and my vision seems to be a bit blurry. I have felt this way in the past but never as bad; I always just assumed it was from having caffiene, considering I usually have one coffee drink a day. I felt this way just a couple of days ago as well and felt that I needed to eat and eat and eat, even though I had already eaten a couple of hours before.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing I can find on the internet is info about low blood sugar. I am planning on getting a blood test here in a few days from my doctors office...should I have them do one for glucose levels? I am not real sure how to go about dealing with this issue or if it is even something to worry about. Please help! =)",
