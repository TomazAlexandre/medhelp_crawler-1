I dont know much about GD but my grandma has had D almost all her life...\u00a0\u00a0Its rough but you just need to follow your doctors orders and try to eat small meals startch is just sugars watch the carbs..... I would lean more to fruits and meats until you get to see your doctor.... If you start to feel dizzy or light headed try a piece of chocolate or Orange Juice. Most likely means your sugar is dropping..... Good luck to you!",
