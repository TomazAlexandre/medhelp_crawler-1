            "answer": "She might have a thyroid condition. Alot of times when babies thyroid levels are high they have a lack of weight gain. This problem can be treated if seen by a specialist. They can give her a crushed pill that she will have to take everyday. This is something you can atleast ask her doctor about.",

    "question": "I have a ten month old little girl who three weeks ago had a ast of 57 which is down from 80 two weeks prior to that. She is 11.54lb and 26\" long (birth: 6lb 10 oz, 20\"). She stopped gaining weight at 3month and then at 8 months started gaining .23lb (ave) every two weeks until 3 weeks ago. In the last three weeks she has gained .03 lb. She has had a sweet test to rule out cystic Fibrosis, Bone age test (results were: younger than actual age), all hormone levels are normal. She eats 4 jars of meat, 7-8 jars of fruit and veggies, 1/2 cup of baby rice and is nursing 6-7X a day (about 6oz per feeding). Any ideas on why she is not gaining weight. Two more weeks before our next Dr. appt to figure out which specialist to try if she does not gain weight over Christmas. Also just had her blood drawn for liver function levels again today. Don't know if this would help with ideas her poop is like deer droppings small black balls all clumped together. She is happy and hitting most of her milestones.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for any responses I am just very worried.",
