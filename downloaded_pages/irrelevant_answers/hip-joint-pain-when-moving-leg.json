    "question": "Hi, I have had pain in my left hip joint, which I only feel when I bend my leg or my left leg is put into motion where the hip joint is used. This is an inner pain near the groin, so I am confident it is a hip joint issue. I first noticed this pain in 2007 on an elliptical machine. I recently noticed it again because I started exercising and used the same machine. Therefore, this leads me to believe that this hip joint pain is chronic. Also, because I only noticed it while exercising, this tells me the pain is only felt when activity forces my leg to bend causing hip joint pain. I am 26 years old, and I can't remember any trauma that may have occurred to cause this pain. I am about 5'10, and I used to weigh close to 300, but now I am close to 200. Would this weight have any impact on why I am having this hip joint pain? Also, I used to have high blood sugar issues (diabetes) because of my weight, but this has also come down as well to regular levels. This pain is felt with motion, I have tried to stretch to perhaps increase the range of motion, but I think this has just caused me to feel more pain. Can anyone please offer insight into this problem? Unfortunately, I am a hypochondriac, and I imagine the worst case scenario which is cancer. However, this pain has not increased or gotten worse since 2007, and I would think that bone cancer would progress. Insight would be highly appreciated",
