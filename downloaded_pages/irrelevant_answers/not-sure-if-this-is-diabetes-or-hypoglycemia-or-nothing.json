            "answer": "Hello guitarsam,I apologize for the delayed response.First I need to tell you that I am not a medical professional, so my input/advice is not in place of advice from a physician.\u00a0\u00a0I am simply giving you input based on my own knowledge and personal experiences.My son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes at the age of 3...he is now 9-1/2 years old.\u00a0\u00a0My ister was diagnosed 8 yrs. ago at the age of 24.I want to make sure I completely understand.\u00a0\u00a0After reading your post, I am under the impression that you do not have diabetes, but are simply asking for advice pertaining to diabetes & hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Please correct me if I am wrong and if I am, I apologize in advance for the misunderstanding.As far as the way you have been feeling AFTER eating, I am honestly unsure what is the culprit.\u00a0\u00a0My son has never complained of this foggy feeling after eating.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms of hypoglycemia would include: (and once again if you have diabetes and already know these symptoms, forgive me)Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)- shakiness- fast heartbeat (could feel like anxiety)- impaired vision- hunger- weakness, tired(High Blood Sugar can cause frequent urination and large amounts)Again, I am unclear if you have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I perceived your post as a non-diabetic looking for answers.\u00a0\u00a0If this is the case and you are concerned becaue of the light-headedness and other sympstoms you experience at certain time, you should see your physician.\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever had a glucose fasting test?I apologize that I could not fully answer your questions.\u00a0\u00a0My only additional input is if you have had various tests done by a particular physician, possibly get a second opinion by seeing another physician.Please check this forum often as others will comment in regards to your questions.",

            "answer": "Hello GuitarSam,I'm not a physician and so my opinions here are just opinions of a long-time diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I do encourage you to talk to your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Contacting him/her in the morning might allow you to get some concrete info before the weekend.What you describe could be blood sugar related, could be blood pressure related, could be related to your meds (or combinations) or underlying conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Since you've had a cardiology workup, I'm guessing they also checked your lungs and that you're getting plenty of oxygen.In any event, it sees reasonable to get to the root cause of that foggy feeling.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't normal and could interfere with your daily actitivites.I hope you'll be feeling well soon.",

    "question": "Wanted to know if the symptoms I'm experiencing are blood sugar related such as diabetes or hypoglycemia.After eating, my ears feel full and I feel \"foggy,\" inability to concentrate, feeling of brain fog, and slightly off balance.\u00a0\u00a0I also experience this same thing immediatley following exercise and immediately upon getting up in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0This usually lasts for about 30 minutes to an hour following eating or exercise.\u00a0\u00a0It can also happen randomly throughout the day, but I can't figure out any pattern.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diagnosed with Generalized Anxiety and am on medication for it, but this has been occurring for several years (since before medicine).\u00a0\u00a0 Lastly, I've had several episodes where after drinking soda before bed that I had extreme urgency to urinate during the night, to the point that I actually started going.I've had full cardiology and neurological workups which have yielded all normal results.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound blood sugar related at all?",
