    "question": "I have been to see pdoc today after having a bit of a wobble following 2 months off medication (did not go cold turkey, did it over 3 months).\u00a0\u00a0She has prescribed me Zyprexa but I am really scared about taking it, I really don't want to gain weight - I am still trying to lose the weight I gained on Depakote.\u00a0\u00a0I am also worried about the risks of low blood sugar/diabetes as I already have problems with sugar loss (though I am not diabetic), also the dizziness thing - I already have bad episodes of dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0I did tell her all of this but she just waved her hands about and said to start me on low dose.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried Seroquel (I reacted badly to that and had to come off it after a week), Depakote (which made me gain weight and left my mood very flat and did not help with the irratibility) as well as various anti-depressants (which of course made bipolar worse) and Metazapine (which caused muscle twitching).Is anybody else taking Zyprexa, if so how have you found it.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice, experiences would be much appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I am finding the whole thing very difficult.\u00a0\u00a0Its taken me over 15 years to accept the diagnosis and I'm still not coping with it.\u00a0\u00a0Help!.\u00a0\u00a0Helen",
