            "answer": "Hi-I've had AIH for 23 years, and take 50 mg Imuran everyday;\u00a0\u00a0they tried getting me off it several times, but I go out of remission w/in 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I did ask about those supplements and took them faithfully for several years w/out any problems.\u00a0\u00a0I really don't know if they were helping, but may try them again sometime.\u00a0\u00a0Ya never know how you would do if you weren't taking them...I've read that certain races are prone to this disease, and I fit the profile.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I was 40 years old when I first got ill, which is classic.\u00a0\u00a0There are autoimmune cases in our family, but I never really paid attention before.\u00a0\u00a0One of my sons has type 1 diabetes since he was 10, but he's 25 now.\u00a0\u00a0One of my daughters has had to have her thyroid radiated because of an autimmune problem.\u00a0\u00a0And these are not the family background I referred to--I found quite a few autoimmune cases in grandparents, ect.Please be assured that things get more normal as you get used to the fact that you have to deal with serious business.It is nice to meet you, as I really have never run into anyone with the same basic profile.\u00a0\u00a0Any time you want encouragement, just write.",

            "answer": "Hi, glad you have been diagnosed, this can often get misses as indeed mine was for some time.\u00a0\u00a0I have PBC aswell which was what I was diagnosed with first.I agree that you should always check on other suppliments.\u00a0\u00a0I only take cod liver oil tablets as a supplement with my meds.Just a thought though,\u00a0\u00a0if you ever feel unwell on your meds, please do not be afraid to challenge your doc.\u00a0\u00a0I took mine as instructed and became so ill.\u00a0\u00a0After the months trial, I went into a major flare up and the bilirubin went up to 87 so I was a beautiful shade of butterscotch!!It was found that I could not tollerate some of the chemicals added to the drug so I was given something more 'pure' which is mycophenolate Mofetil.\u00a0\u00a0What a wonderful drug.\u00a0\u00a0it is an immunosuppressant.\u00a0\u00a0This with the ursodeoxycholic Acid has stabilised me totally and my bilirubin is 13, my alt 49 instead of 120.I am not on steroids at all either.\u00a0\u00a0Do not be afraid to badger the professionals if you do not feel right, it is not worth the consequences.",

            "answer": "Just had a call from my GP\u00a0\u00a0I may be AIH.\u00a0\u00a0It may be sometime until I get into a gastroenerologist so in the mean time I am trying to become informed. These drugs you spoke of in the above post, are they an alternative to prednisone etc? Does anyone know what happens to people with AIH that undertake a liver detox with a naturopath or even liver cleansing capsules( milk thistle etc)Does that make your immune system even turn on you more?",

    "question": "My question is: since having this diagnosis do you stay away from supplementation for other health benefits? I was wanting to take chondroitin and glucosamin for my joints. I don't want to take anything that will compromise my liver. I currently am on 5 mg of prednisone and 50 mg of Imuran. I get checked now every 6 months and everything is back to normal levels except my bilirubin is slightly out of range but doc doesn't feel its an issue. I have been experiencing a little bit of joint pain in my back and knees when I get up in the morning. Thinking this is because I don't exercise enough or just getting older! Any thoughts on this would be appreciated. I was diagnosed with this about 3 years ago and I am 52 years of age. A complete surprise when diagnosed with this. Its not in the family history except my mother had thyroid issues and diabetes.",
