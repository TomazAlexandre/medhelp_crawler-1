            "answer": "I agree with caregiver222 that at the age of 115 years of age, you would have some problem with your eyesight\u00a0\u00a0LOL :)Seriously though, it is very common to see floaters and most people have these but are not always aware of them.If your floaters and flashing little lights seem as if you want to catch them with your hand, this could be a sign of low iron levels.\u00a0\u00a0 A blood test to check your iron levels will show if you are anaemic or not.If you are overtired and watching the screen and playing too long, that can affect your eyes and sometimes even cause migraines when you may see white zig zag lights even when you close your eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Limit your time looking at a monitor scree and ensure you get a good night rest.Make an appointment to see your doctor to check your iron levels.Also book an appointment to see an ophthalmologist, this is a specialist who deals with the anatomy, physiology and diseases of the eye.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",
