I'm glad I decided to stay on it through my pregnancy because I ended up with gestational diabetes and I'm able to control my blood sugar through my diet with the help of the Metformin. My baby is a normal healthy size as well. I honestly don't believe the Met will do any damage to the development of a fetus. The pro's have outweighed the cons in my case.",
