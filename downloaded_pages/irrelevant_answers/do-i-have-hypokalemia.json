            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, the symptoms could be due to hypokalemia. The only way to know for sure is get a serum electrolytes done. What you need to do is eliminate the common causes of increase in weight such as overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Anemia, low proteins, adrenal gland problems, kidney and liver problems and Cushing Syndrome has to be eliminated. Late night snacking and poor sleep patterns too cause weight gain. Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain. Most of these problems can also cause symptoms you are having.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "for several years now i have had a number of medical issues. I have had palpitations, pins & needles, nausea, stomach aches, dry mouth, twitching/sore/inflamed tongue, hallucinations, hypotension, irregular heart beat, sleep apnea, muscle twitches, lower back pain, i had rapid weight gain which resulted in stretch marks on my stomach, arms and inner thigh.\u00a0\u00a0Some of these symptoms all at once in several different episodes which last a few weeks, then most of the symptoms subside. I was told a couple of years ago that i was getting the side effects of some stomach medication i was on (lansoprazole) and have since come off them.\u00a0\u00a0I am now having another episode of the symptoms above. I was searching the internet and found hypokalemia which seem to have similar symptoms. Does anyone know any more about this condition and/or whether they think i might have it.",
