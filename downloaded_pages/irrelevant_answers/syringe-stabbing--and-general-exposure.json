            "answer": "In answer to your questions.1. No; 2. Yes; 3. a proper syringe would invariably draw a drop of blood; 4. even if it had HIV+ blood in it, your chances of getting HIV are very small - 0.3% is the risk for needle stick injuries in health workers.Dalyk - I would advise 2 things. Firstly, you are showing excessive paranoia - you should probably find a mental health professional to discuss this with. Secondly, you should read up about HIV transmission if that is what you fear. You cannot catch HIV from toilet splash backs or from eating without washing your hands. You may get other infections but not HIV.Good luck and I hope that helps.",

However when I looked behind later, I see her putting something back in her pocket and then when I walked back past her, she started laugthing with her boyfiend, but I caught her looking at me when she was laugthing.Because I am African, I have a perception that everyone wants to give me aids, because that is where it started at.Please could you answer me the following things.1) Do you think the girl would have stabbed me with a syringe, and conspired this with her boyfriend.2) Would I differently notice being stabbed in the bum with a syringe.3)What type of mark would show, how much bleeding.4) If it was a syringe what is the chances of me contracting HIV.I really need to know this info, because my lack of knowledge is getting me so paranoid to the end result of depression.Thankyou to anyone that can help.Also I am paranoid when the toilet splashes back, or I eat without washing my hands.Please please please help methanks bob",
