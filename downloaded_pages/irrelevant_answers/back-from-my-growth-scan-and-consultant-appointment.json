I don't wanna be away from my daughter that long, I'm realy close to her! I know inductions are different every time so hopefully if I am induced it'll be better than last time. I'm so anxious. :(",

    "question": "Just a little update from me really.. I'm 39+3 ..my growth scan all is fine which I'm happy about as I have gestational diabetes. I am due on Saturday and they will be inducing me Saturday morning UK time 8am. I was induced with my daughter and it took three days and it wasn't a great experience for me. I'd rather avoid being induced again. Midwives are giving me a sweep tomorrow morning, if that fails another one on Saturday. Hope he comes on his own before my due date.. just thought I would update x",
