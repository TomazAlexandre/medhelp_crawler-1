Was convinced I had some terrible illness.\u00a0\u00a0But my doctor thinks it is all due to high anxiety, which I've experienced on and off for years.\u00a0\u00a0I would also recommend cutting out caffeine and sugar from your diet and make sure you take a multi vitamin.\u00a0\u00a0And get out and take walks if you can.\u00a0\u00a0Alone or with a friend.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you feel better soon!\u00a0\u00a0Let us know how you're doing.\u00a0\u00a0You're going to be fine!",

            "answer": "Hi, the recommendations from northcoast above are good for helping to relieve anxiety form any cause.\u00a0\u00a0However, at your age there are many cause of tingling in the arms and legs - a condition called neuropathy (nerve disease).\u00a0\u00a0I do not think it sounds like anxiety because you first noticed the tingling and then became very anxious about it.\u00a0\u00a0(understandably)Symptoms like yours could result from a variety of things.\u00a0\u00a0The most common at your age would be Vitamin B-12 deficiency (as we age our ability to absorb B-12 from our diets diminishes).\u00a0\u00a0Also the absorption is decreased if you regularly take anything to lower the acid in your stomach.\u00a0\u00a0This would be antiacids, acid blockers (like Nexium, Zantac, Protonix, Prevacid, etc.)The second most common cause would be Type II diabetes which can sneak up on you and show up first with tingling or buring in the extremities.\u00a0\u00a0If you haven't had a fasting sugar checked this year, have it done.Finally another common cause is small blood vessel disease from hypertension.\u00a0\u00a0It's also called Peripheral Artery Disease.\u00a0\u00a0Very often there is noticeably poor circulation in the hands and feet and they may always feel cold.There are also a myriad of neurological causes, but I would ask your Dr. about being checked for some of the routine disorders that cause tingling.\u00a0\u00a0Even if someone is known to have an anxiety disorder, it is inappropriate to dismiss new symptoms without at least a check of the common causes.It's like this.\u00a0\u00a0Lets say someone has an Anxiety Disorder and they always complain of chest pain, and they're always afraid of a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0Then one day they have a different kind of pain and they feel worse with it.\u00a0\u00a0Just because they have anxiety it doen't mean that they AREN'T having a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0A doctor has to keep an open mind and not dismiss new symptoms by making assumptions.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not saying this is you, I'm just making up an example.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor won't listen to your concerns, see someone else!Good luck, Quix",

    "question": "I am a female, 75 years old and in good general health; a history of IBS, with annual colonoscopies for years, bulging disc in back, and high blood pressure which I control with medication. For the past 6 months I have been experiencing such distress, beginning with a tingling feeling in my arms which ultimately causes me great anxiety and an inability to feel at peace. My doctor said it was anxiety disorder and put me on Ativan (10mg) although I have taken only 1/2 pill because it makes me so drowsy. With no improvement, I called my doctore who called in Paxil for me (20mg). I took one and had a very bad reaction! Much worse than normal anxiety. He suggested I reduce it by half and I did. Now I am experiencing tingling also in my legs and feel quite depressed and disabled by this. Any idea what this could be? I need help! Thank you.",
