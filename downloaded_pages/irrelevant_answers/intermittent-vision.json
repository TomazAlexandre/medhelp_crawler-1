            "answer": "Sorry...I omitted the fact that I have seen more than one opthmalmologist, and they didn't discover anything unusual except a slight cataract condition. I just made another appointment with my opthalmologist to explain that my distance vision continues to change back and forth enough to make most of my glasses prescriptions unusable. I want to make sure that we've looked into everything. I am 66, so it might be an old age thing. Thanks!",

    "question": "Although my GP says I do not have diabetes, I seem to have a symptom, related to diabetes.My vision changes from day to day. Blurry for a few days, then fairly clear, then very blurry fora day or two, etc... It's been this way for a few years now, and seems to be getting worse.I'm very healthy, nutritionally conscious, and exercise regularly. I haven't been able to correlatethe blurriness with any food, drink, or activities..Eye Physicians haven't had an answer. My GP had me go through a few tests, including MRI.He says I'm \"fine\".
