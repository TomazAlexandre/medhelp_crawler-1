            "answer": "You have a serious problem and skin cream antibiotics are inappropriate. They only create a situation for a mutated bacteria resistant to antibiotics. MSRA is going around.You need to back to the doctor. Minor toe infections can grow inward and develop osteomyelitis with a few days resulting in toe amputation. These infections are common with diabetics but can occur with anyone. Oral antibiotics do not diffuse readily in the toes. That is a big problem, because the oral dose to maintain therapeutic concentrations in the toe become toxic. In 1975 the Veterans Administration did tests with silvered silk soaked in saline attached to the positive side of a 1 1/2 volt battery to treat these infections. See the book \"The Body Electric\" for the study. The silver ioones went 1/4 inch into the skin and destroyed the infection. The jan 2011 Journal of Infectious diseases suggests an oral fluoroquinalone (Cipro)is as effective as intravenous medications (generally Vancomyacin) for osteomyletitis of the toe. You need to see a physician.",

            "answer": "Sorry, I forgot to say that any cut will be tender and sore whilst it is healing.\u00a0\u00a0The duration of tenderness and soreness depends on the size and depth of the cut and how quickly your body heals.As you have already been to see your doctor, have had an oral antibiotic and an antibiotic ointment as a precautionary measure against any bacterial infection, by what I can see you should experience no problems.My first message mentions the signs to watch for that would require further medical attention.People who have diabetes have to be extra careful, because open wounds are very slow to heal when someone has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0People with diabetes can also have nerve damage and cannot feel properly and would not always be aware that they an open wound or sore (especially under their foot) and this is how bacterial can enter and they would not be aware that they need medical attention.Best wishes.",

It is currently senstive to the touch, but not extremely painful. In addition, it does not feel warm. Is the redness surrounding the cut normal, or do i need to go back to the doctor?",
