    "question": "Hi girls,Something new happend to me today..and I don't know if it relates to my Gestational Diabetes, pregnancy or something else..??I woke up this morning and didn't know where I was! (Or fully who I was)I couldn't picture the rest of what was outside of the bedroom.I didn't even realise I was/am pregnant.I knew who I was, but not my age..and I kept thinking I was in my old apartment that I have not lived in for over 7years.It took me maybe a minute to slowly start picturing the rest of our apartment outside the bedroom.My hubby had left the bed, which I didn't even think about.. I didn't know I had one.One minute may not sound long, but it FELT very long.Even when going up, having figured everything out I felt as if I was in a memory.As I was temporarily in a different time.The blinds were shut and it took me a while to start remembering the outside view... this even after I figured out where I lived etc etc..I don't understand why it happend.. what may have caused it...???I've googled it but not really found anything..Does anyone else have this?Is it pregnancy related???",
