    "question": "I am going on 16 weeks now and have no idea what is causing my contstant aching in my arms. 17 weeks ago, I cut myself shaving with a borrowed razor. 10 days later my sinuses were inflamed and my muscles began THROBBING. appx 21 days later my sinuses cleared and my muscles just became fatigued without exercise. They remain so after 16 weeks.At 10 weeks HVB surface Antigen and HVC Antibody=both Neg. At 11 weeks, HVC PCR RNA Qual=UND. Same for Lyme Disease and West Nile Virus, and Mono. My ALT at 4 weeks and at 11 weeks was 30, the AST almost unchanged @ 23. The only thing that came up was a former EBV infection with a count of 4.72. No fever or nights sweats.Any idea what might be causing this cosntant fatigue in my arms??Thank You...",
