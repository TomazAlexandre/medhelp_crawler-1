            "answer": "Hi and welcome,It wouldn't be common for an individual to be dx with your medical combination but depression is actually a fairly common problem for people living with any chronic medical condition. Mental health issues can be a separate medical issue on top of their other health situation, a chronic condition definitely has a greater risk factor because of the way a particular condition can affect the brain, living or dealing with the condition itself and medications that treat the condition can also cause or exacerbate mental health problems too.1 in 4 of the general population will experience depression at some stage in their life, statistics for diabetes is around 30%, aids has similar stats but MS depression in its various forms is one of the most common symptoms of multiple sclerosis, the severest form major depressive disorder is unfortunately more frequent among people with MS than in many other chronic illnesses.\"Perhaps 50 per cent of people with MS experience this more serious depression at some point.You are considered clinically depressed if at least five of the following symptoms are present for at least two weeks:*depressed mood, feelings of hopelessness and despair*significantly reduced interest or pleasure in most activities*changes in appetite and noticeable weight loss or gain*insomnia (inability to sleep) or hypersomnia (excessive sleeping)*feelings of excessive restlessness or sluggishness*fatigue or loss of energy*feelings of worthlessness, excessive or inappropriate guilt*reduced ability to think or concentrate, or indecisiveness*recurrent thoughts of death or suicideThese symptoms would need to be severe enough to upset a daily routine, interfere with relationships, or severely impair work. Healthcare professionals will also need to establish that the depression is not linked to another cause such as medication or bereavement.Depression is often misunderstood, so people affected might not get a diagnosis or treatment. If you think you may be depressed, it is important to consult a health care professional as soon as possible. Depression is something you cannot prevent, and it should not be considered embarrassing or shameful.\"http://www.mssociety.org.uk/what-is-ms/signs-and-symptoms/mental-health/depressionIf you suspect you might be experiencing depression, please contact your doctor to discuss all the treatment options that are available to you..Cheers.......JJ",
