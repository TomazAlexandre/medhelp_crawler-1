    "question": "Hi Dr. Mark -\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed as hypothyroid in July at age 28.\u00a0\u00a0My mother and her sister were both also hypothyroid, both diagnosed in their mid forties.\u00a0\u00a0My mother and I recently went to the endo and had our antibodies tested - both positive for Hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are, does it mean anything that I became hypothyroid at a much younger age or were they both probably Hashimoto's at my age and just diagnosed at a later time?\u00a0\u00a0I am nervous that this would put me more at risk for another autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0My mother also has multiple sclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you in advance.",
