I aso wake up with pins and needles in my hands but I have had that for years. I always thought it was carpal tunnel but maybe not. I will let my doctor know soon. Waiting to see what happens.I started taking B6 that used to always help with the pins and needles. Why do you think you had a TIA?",

            "answer": "I have had numerous spine issues that have come up in the past few years and have had both cervical and lumbar surgeries.\u00a0\u00a0My primary complaint was a burning pain in the outside of my left thigh, which I would experience after standing or walking for varying amounts of time.\u00a0\u00a0One time in a bookstore, when the pain came, I literally gasped and limped out to my car.....once seated, the pain went away.\u00a0\u00a0Then, the process would start all over again.\u00a0\u00a0I believe it is called Meralgia Paresthetica and usually results from a nerve being compressed.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to try physical therapy with a particular type of therapist.....one that practices \"mechanical link\".\u00a0\u00a0It might take a bit of searching, because there are so few therapists that practice this method - but it is well worth the search.\u00a0\u00a0Short of that, you may want to get a referral to a neurosurgeon for a consultation.\u00a0\u00a0Personally, I don't think the pain will go away on its own....here's a link for you to look at and see if your situation fits the description:http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=A00340Good luck!",
