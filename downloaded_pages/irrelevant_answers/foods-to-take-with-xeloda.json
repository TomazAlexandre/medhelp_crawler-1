Attached is the patient insert that is provided by the manufacturer http://www.rocheusa.com/products/xeloda/ppi.html",

    "question": "I've just begun to take Xeloda and am unsure as to what foods I can take with it.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard that anything with folic acid and/or calcium in it may render Xeloda ineffective.\u00a0\u00a0If this is true, could you give me an idea of what foods I can eat before I take it?\u00a0\u00a0I am NOT a breakfast eater and so can't eat eggs, or pancakes or cereal.\u00a0\u00a0Would a banana and muffin be okay?\u00a0\u00a0How about yogurt or a breakfast bar.\u00a0\u00a0I'm really lost as to what to eat when I take the Xeloda and would really appreciate your help!\u00a0\u00a0What is important - fat grams, number of calories, carbs?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so very very much!",
