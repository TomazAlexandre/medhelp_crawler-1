            "answer": "Hello Jen,Diabetes isn't contagious in that you can't \"catch it\" like a cold or a virus from someone else.\u00a0\u00a0Researchers aren't yet 100% sure how we get it, but it seems to be partly genetic and partly environmental.It may well take time for your cousin to learn about his/her? disease and sometimes newly diagnosed people are private about it.\u00a0\u00a0Often they & their families are scared and sometimes overwhelmed by all there is to learn & do.I was diagnosed when I was a teen; I am now 48 and have done everything in high school, college, grad school, work, travel, relationships that I want.\u00a0\u00a0You can encourage your cousin, too and the more you learn about his/her disease the more WONDERFUL your support can be.\u00a0\u00a0It already sounds like you're a caring cousin, and please know that means a great deal to someone coping with a chronic disease.You might like to follow the links to the JDRF website to read & learn about the research going on to find a cure.\u00a0\u00a0There are great links that will also benefit your cousin, & your aunt & uncle.",
