            "answer": "Yes I have had a biopsy and a viral load done. I am still compensated but 6/6 on fibrosis(cirrhosis),4/4 piecemeal necrosis,portal inflammation 2/4, focal inflammation 1/4, confluent nicrosis 0/6, and total hepactic activity is 7/18.My viral load is 3,500,000. Last CBC showed ALT at 236 and AST at 162. Dr said I must have had this for over 20 years. However may ALT and AST went down from 359/221 respectively just one month prior. I have been trying to do a little scientific measurement on my own with herbs and cotrol the experiment to see if it helps. The only thing I really change in my lifestyle to maybe cause a drop like that is Milk Thistle in combination with another combination herb called \"Hep C Support\". This conclusion is by far from being conclusive.I have ben told by St. Louis Dr. tht I still have time but he wants me to just start treatment now and I have not got a local GI to monitor me and he is 225 miles away in St. Louis. I got sick enough I had to stop teaching with my diabetes, Hep C, ad cirrhosis complications. This dont sound sensible to me with the possible side effects I may have.suggestions. I would really like to try BLIN 2061 ina clinical trial or even combo therapy of Interferon in a clinical setting where I am monitored instead of just being sent 225 miles away to do it on my own. My PCP dont know Hep C and doesnt treat it.Your comments would be appreciated--all comments and",

    "question": "I would like to know how to find some local support groups. Groups that I can actually set down and talk with people. Can someone help me. My PCP is on maternity leave and I am to sart treatment in November. None of the doctors I have seen made any attempt to point me to a local support group. In fact the 2 GI's I seen said since I have cirrhosis hey wouldnt recommend TX because of the success rate. I had to referred to Washington University in St. Louis into a \"protocol\" before a doctor said yes that he would treat me. Also, both of the local GI's made mistakes in their notes and one even said I told him I had a sexual relationship with another man---my painting partner. The oter guy said I had a fairly heavy usage of alcohol. Neither one was true and I didnt tell them that inthe brief 15 minutes I had with them. I called them down on it and one ammended my record on the gay stuff and the other on alchol wouldnt.I am trying to get Social Security disability until I can go through treatment. I am in Cox health network with my insurance and when one of these guys wont treat you--no one else will either. I even tried to change PCP's and got a run around.I taught IT classes at the University but had to quit because of fatigue and diabetes and Hep C and advanced cirrhosis causing me to have fainting spells.Anyone else with these same problems?",
