Almost exactly the latest treatment for the resistant yeast infections that won't go away is boric acid capsules I have to insert nicely along wit vaginal Valium suppositories. It is very discouraging. I am working with a Gino urologist. Let's keep each other posted on treatments and progress. I hope others will provide us with direction. I am 56, May i ask your age?I also do not have diabetes or a STD.",

            "answer": "Have you been checked for interstitial cystitis? I have that as well as MANY other pelvic floor health issues and I too have been using the vaginal valium since 2011 for pelvic floor dysfunction...have you seen a Urogynecologist to check for pelvic organ prolapse? in the mean time while you try to figure this stuff out...alternate frozen ice bottle and heated rice pack while lying with knees in a position to elevate above the hips (such as legs up the wall or with them bent on a chair) this forces the pelvic floor muscles to relax...the heat will relax the muscles and the cold will numb the nerves...this might help break the cycle of pain your body is going into...I have been dealing with this stuff since 1994 and with these methods and non-acidic diet, probiotics I rarely need medications...but if I do pyridium is my go to to calm my grumpy bladder as well as the vaginal valium...Hope you can get this figured out as it's hard to know how to make it better if you don't know what is going on..so keep seeking answers! Let us know what you find and we will do our best to help you to a better place!",

    "question": "In late May I noticed some bladder discomfort after sex, slight vaginal burning and a full belly. It subsided until intercourse a few days later with the same symptoms. The next morning, the symptoms were persistent, so I figured I had a UTI. I started having flank pain and took a antibiotic I had at home. I took it for 7 days and then it got worse. I started having frequent urination and burning. I went to my doctor did a urine test and found I had no bacteria. I also have had vaginal yeast infections I have been on 4 rounds if antibiotics one of which was a long term. I have now started the candida cleanse the first 4 days the burning had completely stopped and now on day 12 things are much worse than they were before I began the diet! My gyn also put me in 10 days 150mg of difulcian. Has this ever happened to anyone else?! All STDS and diabetes have been ruled out! I just want to be normal again, I'm so depressed.",
