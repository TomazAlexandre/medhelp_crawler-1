Considering age, if you were I would lean towards you being a Type-1 diabetic; but you don't talk about being diabetic.I agree with Bruce_Bear, this does not sound at all like neuropathy and you should get in to see your doctor as quickly as possible.",

    "question": "I am 19 years old and came back home from a 2-week trip to Mexico about 2 weeks ago. While I was in Mexico I felt strange about 4 days into the vacation but I just tried ignoring it at the time. Then when I came back to the U.S. I still felt much different than before The trip.Symptoms included feeling full too full to eat food, feeling drunk or high most of the time, a change in my vision, inability to concentrate on things, felt nauseous and had heartburn and acid reflux, especially after meals and when I hadn't eaten, an unbalanced feeling, and felt slower than usual and uncoordinated. The best description I can give is a feeling of being drunk or high, including delayed response to touch, or sights. My mind feels slower sometimes I cant think.I still feel these symptoms now but but they are not quite as strong as when I first felt them. Could this be diabetic neuropathy, at my age? I have a family history of diabetes but only\u00a0\u00a0my grandparents since age 40+.I am 5'8 135 lbs and have been athletically active for most of my life, just for a little background.",
