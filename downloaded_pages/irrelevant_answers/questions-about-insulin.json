            "answer": "Sounds like you have been having a terrible time. And if you aren't getting the answers you need, maybe you should be looking for a second opinion. High blood sugars and keytones are a dangerous and untenable combination.In your previous post you mention that high doses of Novolog and Lantus don't seem to be working. I personally get very good results with these insulins. And it does sound like your daughter is not responding to it for some reason. This sometimes happens.A small percentage of diabetics are not able to use synthetic human insulin. Have you tried her on pork insulin? It is a long shot. But if nothing else is working, definately worth looking into.Best Wishes,Mark",

            "answer": "JayHawk,Metformin is an interesting choice of med, not often used with Type 1 but clearly used some of the time.\u00a0\u00a0Is your daughter overweight (I'm wondering about insulin resistance)?\u00a0\u00a0I imagine she's lost a lot of energy thru high BG and ketones and may be getting increasingly tired.I would ask for a kidney function test also.\u00a0\u00a0Her body is clearly stressed and the kidneys have to work overtime to (try to) flush the ketones.\u00a0\u00a0Have her drink a lot of water.Like your approach, I wouldn't rest until I found answers.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that you'll check into the friendly folks at JDRF Online Diabetes Support Team.\u00a0\u00a0They can usually point folks to local resources fairly quickly.",
