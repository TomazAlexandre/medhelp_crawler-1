            "answer": "If you have diabetes you need to see a MD physician NOT an nom-physician, limited care optometrist. If you see an Eye MD usually your health insurance will pay for the exam. Find an Eye MD at www.aao.orgWhen your blood sugars are out of wack it causes your glasses prescription to change. You can expect some changing and bluring of your vision until you get your blood surgars stable and your A1C below 8JCH III MD",

    "question": "I'm 23 years old and recently diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I had uncontrolled diabetes with high blood sugar for approx 5-6 months prior to being diagnosed but no longer than that.\u00a0\u00a0A few days after being diagnosed/treated and started on an insulin regimen, I woke up and put my glasses on and I couldn't see.\u00a0\u00a0With my glasses off, I don't feel that my prescription has changed much or at all, but when I put my glasses on I can't pick out an object and focus on it.\u00a0\u00a0Everything is blurry.\u00a0\u00a0I'm having headaches as well, which I figure is because of my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I've been reading about Diabetic Retinopathy and it doesn't really feel like that's what I have?\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0Also - I have an appt with an optometrist but it isn't until the 7th.\u00a0\u00a0Should I see an Opthamologist instead?\u00a0\u00a0Should I go to the ER?\u00a0\u00a0It's been 2 days now.",
