Hang in there, I've had a difficult pregnancy too. I thought it would be more enjoyable, but it's all worth it in the end! Just keep thinking about you little bundle of joy!!!",

    "question": "Any mama's in those last few weeks just feel like the cannot do this any longer? I am in severe constant pain. I can no longer dress myself, get in and out of bed, or sit up for more than a half hour at a time. I'm in and out of the hospital weekly, if not more frequently. I'm 33 & 5 and I'm burning out quickly. This has not been a happy or exciting pregnancy, and I'm just so sick of being in pain. The goal is to make it to 37 before induction but seeing as how I can't move on my own, those few weeks seem like months. Any advice on how to relax?",
