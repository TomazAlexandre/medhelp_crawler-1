            "answer": "good for you for recognizing some troublesome signs....the gluc reading depends alot on in what calibration you are using...I assume its mg/dL (US) in this case appears 123 is within normal range.....I will send you some charts and a site with tons of info.Given the symptoms Oliver is showing I would ask you to PLEASE take him to a Vet for further lab tests..excessive drinking/urination can also be a symptom of HyperThyroid...http://www.catinfo.org/?link=felinediabetes#In-Home_Blood_Glucose_Monitoringhttp://petdiabetes.wikia.com/wiki/Blood_sugar_guidelines",

            "answer": "Hi aligator79,I just finished reading your comments. I agree with Opus88's commentsand suggestions. Excessive drinking and excessive peeing are signsof diabetes. Our cat , Sammie, who is also a senior cat ( 8 years old )was diabetic , a year ago. His diabetes was discovered through ablood test as well more than a year ago. We adopted Sammie from acat rescue society. My point is we didn't raise him from a kitten. Wedidn't know anything about his medical history besides the informationwe received from his former veteranarian. When my husband and I werefirst told Sammie had diabetes, we were rather shocked. Our vet, though,is very good. She assured us that she has many clients whose cats have diabetes. We were asked to take Sammie to the vet and leave him thereovernight. What they were doing is determining how many units ofinsulin Sammie required while being carefully observed at the vets.We were shown how to administer insulin through a needle and told howmany units he needed a day. Then a month later, they gave him afructosamine test and the test suggested that the amount we were givinghim was too much. My husband and I kept a record in a notebook ofeach unit of insulin, how much food was given to him, time it was given.Several fructosamine tests later, the vet said his fructosamine levels weregood and that he didn't have to have insulin anymore. So now, Sammieis no longer diabetic. Doesn't need insulin needles, but the vet said to contine giving him diabetic cat food, but he is only allowed a certainamount every day. We feed him a certain times during the day and wekeep track of the time of every feeding and the amount we feed him.Our Sammie was 16 lbs when he was last weighed. Our vet is very pleasedwith his progress and especially the fact that he is no longer diabetic.Best of luck with your kitty. I hope my post is helpful to you. Eve :)",
