            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Mild variations weight changes are a normal occurrence. It could be that you are recuperating from chicken pox and it may take time for proper weight gain. Personality is important, but it\u2019s at its best only when you are most comfortable in it. The goal should be to be healthy and fit. Also the RBBB (right bundle branch block) may not cause significant symptoms.But sometimes, unintentional weight loss can occur with hyperthyroidism, diabetes, certain medications, depression, eating disorders, and infections and due to loss of appetite. So, if it persists consult your doctor for an evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
