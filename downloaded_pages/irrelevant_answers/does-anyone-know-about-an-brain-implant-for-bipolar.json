            "answer": "I don't know anything about brain implant. This is the first time I have heard of it. Does your dr take Medicare? If he does, you should not have to pay that much. I would contact Social Security Office or the number on the Medicare Card to get info on that. If they accept Medicare and there is a co payment to be made, then the dr is not suppose to bill you for what Medicare doesn't pay for the rest of the bill. Call them and check it out. Wal Greens has a plan they only charge $4 on 30 day generic meds (it may be Wal Mart) you'd have to check.Personally, I don't want anyone messing with my brain, it is already in bad enough shape, but how long have they been doing the procedure? I wouldn't want to be in the first few and have some info on the long term effects. RJ",

            "answer": "HI there! I have researched it myself. I'm told it's still very experimental, expensive and hard to find a surgeon. You mentioned you don't always take meds, you need to have compliance with taking your meds, that will help, have you also tried different drugs?If you had diabetes, you would take your meds every day, this is no different and can be as fatal. Stay on your meds even if you feel good and it will get better.\u00a0\u00a0I'm in the same position, I'm only getting 60% of what I was earning because I am on long term disability, I'm on a tight budget.
