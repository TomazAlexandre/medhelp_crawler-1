            "answer": "Yours are pretty close to normal. You should be fine. I have gestational diabetes and my 1 hour was over 280 as well as my 2 hour and it was still high by my 3 hour. They didn't put be on insulin just changed what I was eating and it made a huge difference. If they want yours to be lower they might just change your eating schedule to breakfast, snack, lunch, snack, dinner, snack. It helps keep your sugar level normal and it's better for the baby either way. :) you should nothing to worry about",

    "question": "Hey ladies, so I did my 3 hour fast on 12/23 and have yet to hear back from my doctor's office and of course I have called but the dr has been on call and they say she has yet to read them ... yes I know pretty ridiculous but I am going crazy, I know usually they say no news is good news, but does anyone on here know how to interpret their results? Or does anyone have their lab results that they can compare mine too whether you have it or not, that way I can know if I am normal or if I am closer to having it. I googled results and for one of my fasts I was only over by like 3 points, but any help would be greatly appreciated thanks!Normal Fast Glucose Level: 84mg/dLAfter 1 hour: 116mg/dLAfter 2 hour: 158 mg/dL according to online this is over by 2 or 3After 3 hour: 126 mg/dLAll others are significantly lower. When I went in for my 1 hour, I was extremely sick and out with the flu and chugged lots of juice, but I didn't expect to take it that day. After my 1 hour when I was sick my reading was 197/dL ... a huge difference from 197 to 84.If anyone could help ease my mind I'd surely appreciate it.Thanks Ladiesxoxo",
