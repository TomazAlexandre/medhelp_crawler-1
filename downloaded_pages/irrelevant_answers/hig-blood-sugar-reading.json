            "answer": "It is important to keep your sugars lower.\u00a0\u00a0While you are waiting to see your doctor, try excercising (it is a natural way to lower your blood sugar).\u00a0\u00a0Even a walk will help.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't feel up to it, make sure you stay away from sugary, white foods (things high in carbohydrates).276 is a fairly high reading, the range should be 80-120.\u00a0\u00a0Mine is typically 110-170, although after a meal it has been in the 200's.\u00a0\u00a0My husband just found out he has diabetes also, and his was 479 when he found out!So although 276 isn't a good number, they do vary based on what you put in your body, how much excercise you get, and your overall health.\u00a0\u00a0Just a cold can raise your blood sugar levels, did you know that?\u00a0\u00a0Stress?\u00a0\u00a0Yep, raises blood sugar!Good luck on your learning about this disease, and learning to listen to your body.Morrowville",

            "answer": "Many people who have type 2 diabetes will have a high reading from time to time without it being serious if you get it under control. If you can't get your blood sugar down with proper diet and exercise then perhaps you will need insulin at some point.\u00a0\u00a0Really watch your carbohydrates and portions when you eat.\u00a0\u00a0Get out and walk.\u00a0\u00a0Are you on Metformin or Glyburide?\u00a0\u00a0If you are not you need to see your doctor Asap and discuss a program to get things in a healthy way. Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Don't be alarmed ...you can get it down with some work hopefully. Go to American Diabetic Association web page, they have great info to help. Accucheck has a good site with a carb counter also.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!Madge",
