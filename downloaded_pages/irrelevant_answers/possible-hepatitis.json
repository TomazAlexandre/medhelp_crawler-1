            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.If you have been regularly tested for hepatitis and are negative it's unlikely that you have hepatitis now. However, you could get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B. The commonest cause for elevated liver enzymes is due to fatty liver changes. Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels.Besides this they are also elevated in conditions like muscle injury and sometimes due to medications. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I'm 26 years old and a year ago I went to see a nutritionist and took a hair mineral test and found out that I had elevated liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0The nutritionist made a comment about it possibly being hepatitis.\u00a0\u00a0I recently lost 50 pounds but have been obese for many years.\u00a0\u00a0When I went to see my nutritionist I was approximately 200 pounds and I'm 5'3.\u00a0\u00a0I did a little research and found out that elevated liver enzymes can be due to a fatty liver because of obesity.\u00a0\u00a0I also did research on hepatitis and found out that you get hepatitis mainly from sexual activity, blood, and using needles to do drugs.\u00a0\u00a0I've never been in contact with anyones blood, never used drugs, and I recently lost my virginity so my elevated liver enzymes from a year ago couldn't be caused by hepatitis I could've gotten from my partner.\u00a0\u00a0I've also been donating blood to the red cross for many years and previously working for the red cross I know that they test for Hepatitic B and C, HIV, and other diseases so I know that if they found anything wrong with my blood I would've known about it.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had reason to believe that I have hepatitis, hence, I've never been tested.\u00a0\u00a0I dont have any of the physical symptoms but now that I'm having sex I don't want to transmit anything to my partner.\u00a0\u00a0Should I get tested?",
