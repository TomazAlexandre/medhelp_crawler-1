            "answer": "Hi and welcome,I'm assuming that there's a typo and it should read \"I was diagnosis with MS in 1988 in 2002 a differeint rheumatologist/neouroligist downgraded it to 'Fibromyaliga'..\"If you were diagnosed with MS around 27 years ago (1988) it is actually possible for you to have been misdiagnosed, it would seem more likely if in 2002 you didn't actually have the diagnostic clinical and test evidence to support the diagnosis if you were being diagnosed with MS today. It might be helpful to you, if you get a copy of your neurologist reports and test records and see if you had any evidence suggestive or consistent with MS....I had a look at what else you've written and to be honest, it's possible that what you've been experiencing is actually related to your diagnosis of diabetes and your dietary and medications eg inovokana and you should definitely speak to your doctor about what you are experiencing.Cheers......JJhttp://www.drugs.com/sfx/invokana-side-effects.html",

            "answer": "Hi P -It is very possible for MS to go dormant for extended periods of time. In my case it was 15 years between my first and second relapse. During tis time I was largely symptom free. The symptoms of my second relapse included walking like I was drunk and bouncing off walls.A rheumatologist should not me making or downgrading an MS diagnosis. This should only be done by a neurologist, preferably one that specializes in diagnosing and treating MS. The MS society is right, once diagnosed, always diagnosed. But this is based on being properly diagnosed.I would suggest that you find an MS specialist and be reevaluated.Kyle",
