            "answer": "There are sources online that describe disease of the nervous system (primarily MS) as one category of conditions causing muscle spasms.Do you take magnesium supplements?\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests for magnesium levels are usually not helpful as about 95% of our magnesium is stored in the tissues.\u00a0\u00a0Our bodies like to keep the blood level stable, so if there is depletion, it happens first in the tissues. By the time a blood test shows it's low, it's extremely low.\u00a0\u00a0Taking a magnesium ending in -ate is better absorbed than one that just says \"magnesium.\"\u00a0\u00a0Magnesium malate or magnesium citrate are fairly easy to find.\u00a0\u00a0When I started taking magnesium, my neuro symptoms eased up a bit, especially the muscle twitching.Do you drink plenty of fluids, especially water or something supplemented with electrolytes (e.g. Gatorade)?\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes can also cause spasms, so keeping blood sugar in a normal range is important.Have you tried going gluten free?\u00a0\u00a0I definitely felt better when I did. It was a hassle at first, but I am used to it now.",
