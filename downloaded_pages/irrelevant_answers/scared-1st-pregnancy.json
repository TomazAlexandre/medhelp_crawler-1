            "answer": "Congrats! Make sure to get on a good prenatal, i like gummies because they taste better and are easier to swallow. Lots of water. Excercise, but not too heavily. I just do my usual daily routine like i did before i got prego, but i have changed it enough so i dont hurt myslef or baby. Watch your salt intake and dont stress\u00a0\u00a0out too much. I had a miscarriage 4 years ago, and i know stress was a big factor in that. Hope all goes well for you!",

            "answer": "Congrats! I had a miscarriage at 6 weeks on mother's day of this year and ended up pregnant before I even got my next period (seeing as miscarriage for some reason causes extreme fertility). What I think caused my miscarriage was stress in planning conception and wanting to keep the baby so badly. Also I cleaned my bathroom that night so the chemicals from the cleaning supplies didn't help. I was taking prenatals before and during my pregnancy. However I do not recommend that u take gummies because of the high sugar intake with any kind of gummy vitamin. They will help cause your blood sugar to spike once u get a blood test done at the doctor. This especially if u are already considered overweight. I'm not saying that u will get diabetes but gummies are something u want to avoid if u want a tip top healthy pregnancy! My advice is to go with the traditional prenatal vitamins.",
