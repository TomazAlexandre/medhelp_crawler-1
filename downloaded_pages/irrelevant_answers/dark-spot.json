            "answer": "I just completed a phlebotomy class. I learned about this type of bleed. You may have indeed gotten a bruise by some accidental incidence. Sometimes a bruise can get bigger. This is a result of blood under the skin. Go to your primary doc. Also you need to research what spider bites and lyme disease look like.This could be another cause",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This could be a bruise. I think you could have deep vein thrombosis of the deep veins of the leg or maybe valvular dysfunction of the deep veins of the legs. This could be causing venous pooling that could also be making the fragile spider veins burst causing easy bruising. This can be diagnosed by color Doppler or by angiogram of the leg veins or by duplex ultrasound.High blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out. Birth control pill is another cause of bruising (in females). At times adrenal gland insufficiency results in bruising and chronic fatigue syndrome and this possibility should also be explored. It could also be due to pressure urticaria.\u00a0\u00a0Possibility of the bruise being rashes due to contact dermatitis too should be explored.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
