    "question": "Hello Ladies,Yesterday i had my level 2 u/s and it was the most amazing thing.\u00a0\u00a0Firts of all I was very glad to hear that both babies are doing great.\u00a0\u00a0But the details that the doc showed us were just amazing.\u00a0\u00a0He looked at everything: head, heart, kidneys, stomach, measured bones looked at little hands and feet.\u00a0\u00a0And at the end even gave us a 3D show of each of babies face.\u00a0\u00a0Unbelievable.I'm 21w3d, babies were measuring 20w4d and 20w5d and weighted 12 and 13 oz.\u00a0\u00a0The doc said that it's perfectly normal.\u00a0\u00a0They each are proportionate to their own bodies.\u00a0\u00a0And they confirmed that they are both boys.My question to you: what other tests are normally performed in the 2nd trimester.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I don't need an OB app just yet since we saw them yesterday, but I don't want to miss any important milestones.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I can always call the doc to find out, but I don't want them making appts just for the heck of it.",
