            "answer": "Hello,if the medication works, I imagine it would improve in days - weeks (though you should ask your doctor this question).One of the best ways to protect your son's kidneys is to have tight blood sugar control and maintain blood sugars as close to normal (80-140) as you safely can.I recommend that you read \"Diabetes Solutions\" by Dr. Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0His approach to tight blood sugar control is relevant even to children.If your son's HBA1c is significantly high then the high blood sugars will continue to stress his kidneys and cause further damage and continued microalbumin..Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Thank you! I will ask him next month at our appointment.\u00a0\u00a0Most of my sons a1c's have been 6.5-7.0 with a occasionally a 7.0-7.3 and one very high 7.7 which freaked me out. He is almost 6 feet and and athlete, he eats constantly because he is still growing\u00a0\u00a0and he is a teenager which can be difficult to control some of the BS swings. When he was little it was much easier to control because his body was not growing rapidly then. The kidney doc said all diabetics have some chemical and structure change in the kidneys no matter how good the control is. Some diabetics have micro-albumin for several years and it disappears on its own and others have it for life without it ever progressing to proteinuria , it's the luck of the draw he said!",

            "answer": "Hi,your son's hba1c is not terrible.\u00a0\u00a0However, the closer he can safely get it towards normal the better for his long term avoidance of any diabetes related health issues.He and you should both consider low carb, moderate protein and high fat diet - Paleo style eating....\u00a0\u00a0This will give him plenty of energy and will also help with the blood sugar swings.I still recommend the book Diabetes Solutions.\u00a0\u00a0For me it was lifechanging in how I control my diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am a lot older than your son (44) and have been diabetic and on insulin for the past 7 years.\u00a0\u00a0Using low carb approach as well as insulin I tend to have stable blood sugars (without major highs or lows) and my last Hba1c was 5.0.\u00a0\u00a0I just tested for microalbumin at the insistence of my doctor and thankfully it is negative.",

            "answer": "Thanks again! I will look into the book. They do not want normal ranges for kids, they are at greater risk for lows. When he gets older he can focus on tighter control, his doc would never except the 5.0 range. We have noticed with a high fat diet he will get high blood sugar readings 4+ hours after eating and yes that is healthy fats. We pretty much balance everything.",

            "answer": "Hi Annie,Yes, I know they don't want normal ranges for kids.\u00a0\u00a0It is quite an area of controversy, as high blood sugars do affect brain and body development.However, I think the key is to have tight control (avoid both severe highs and significant lows as far as possible).\u00a0\u00a0 I do believe this is possible and there are people who achieve it.That book will give you food for thought.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Bernstein also has just set up a \"Diabetes University\" on u-tube.\u00a0\u00a0You should be able to find it if you google it.",
