    "question": "about a month ago i drove several hundred miles on my motorcyle. i developed \"monkey butt\" and bought gold bond medicated body powder to absorb excess moisture and what not. the pain quickly subsided but a week after i noticed that my butt was itching. i thought it was the healing process and forgot about it. bumps started to form and itch. now they have covered my entire butt, except for the crack. each bump is about 6 millimeters wide and red. once scratched they will raise and itch even more! the bumps have spread between my legs and even on my penis. i think they are plotting on my stomach next. if you need a picture i will work on getting one.",
