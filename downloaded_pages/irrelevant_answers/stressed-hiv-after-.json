    "question": "Please help me deal with my anxiety. Four months ago I received a blow job from a lady I met in a pub in Zimbabwe. I stopped under 1 minute. since then the idea that I caught hiv plays in my mind. I have been reading the internet and the low risk factor makes me calculate the probability of an infection without getting the answer. I had rash on my shoulders after 2 months. A mild cough and pain in my feet which alternate to cold feeling. Tested diabetes and was fine. Scared of facing the job test. Please help. Thank you",
