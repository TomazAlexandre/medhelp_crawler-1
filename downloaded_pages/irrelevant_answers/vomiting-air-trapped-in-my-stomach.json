    "question": "I have a problem with trapped air/gas in my stomach. This most often occurs after I drink any kind of liquid (including water) without eating something, but not always. It does occasionally occur when I eat and drink. But it's not limited to one exclusive type of food or beverage. I get what I call \"gurgle burps\", where the air gurgles up from my stomach, it can sometimes be quite loud, but it doesn't result in an actual burp. It will continue until I get nauseous and go to the bathroom, I will retch and then vomit only air. That seems to help alleviate the problem. For a while. My GI doctor had me try Prilosec, which isn't helping. My next option is the scope examination. Any other suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0I've tried GasX, peppermint oil, and various other \"tummy soothers\" without relief",
