My tests included: blood work for hormone levels, ovulation, thyroid, diabetes, prolactin; an transvaginal ultrasound; an HSG to check for blocked tubes.\u00a0\u00a0It all kind of depended on the medical history they took, which tests they wanted to perform.\u00a0\u00a0We are doing 3 IUI's, and if they don't work, we will re-evaluate.\u00a0\u00a0He may want to do a laproscopic surgery to determine if there is any endometriosis.\u00a0\u00a0Like I say, what they test for is based on your particular medical history.",

            "answer": "I just called my dr's office made an appt with my ob-gyn and told them infertility they asked if I have been trying for a year or more. Then the got me right in. The next week. My Dr. wrote down a list of all the test he will be doing and he took the time to throughly explain each one to me why they do that. After that they will see where to go after that. We already know that i am not ovulating on a reg basis. After all the test he will most likely put me on clomid... Hope this helps. =)",
