    "question": "My BG was (11) and for some reason it has always been high but I should had been on Insulins. It took them to find out that I neded to be on Insulins when I found out I was 7wk. I'm going on 11wk :-) I seen a big improvement going from 500&above to less than 120 most of the time. My castings be low always about 50 but less than 95. So I'm curious when I go to get another test will my numbers go down and is is possible for this diabetes to go away.?",
