I am taking Depo Perva injection, Zyrtec-D qhs, Fluticasone 16GM bid (generic for Flonase,) Nitrofurantion100MG qhs (generic for Macrodantin,) & Ibuprofen 200MG as needed for inflammation.I have been experiencing almost constant swelling of my hands accompanied w/ an intermittent tingling sensation. I have frequent urination, extreme thirst, & bloating. I seem to be exhausted 90% of the time. I also have lots of varicose veins in both my legs. I have a family history of hyperthyroid... should I be concerned? Is this simply a possible side effect to my birth control?",
