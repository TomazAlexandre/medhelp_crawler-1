I'll definitely check out these sites, so thanks.As for the lump, I will get itchecked out as soon as I can, it just seems to be kind of scaring my parents since that was my brothers first symptom when he got sick. I mean, I seriously don't think I'm that sick, but I still want an answer.Thank you",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The lump could be a lymph node or a bone swelling or cyst. It is difficult to comment without examining. This could also be TMJ. It could also be a boil or abscess as this is painful.Since there is associated weight loss, either you are not eating properly due to the pain or there is prolonged infection or a STD like HIV or a lymphoma or any other bone cancer or tuberculosis that could be the cause.The pain in the neck could be due to this swelling which can also cause the headache. It could also be pinched cervical nerves.Since you are now easily breathless doing things you did earlier, get your complete hematology panel done. It could be due to severe anemia.Also unintentional weight loss could be due to malabsorption syndromes.The first thing to do would be to get your lump along the jaw line examined by your doctor. Also get your blood counts, hemoglobin and iron done.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Well, I the lump doesn't seem to be physically connected, as I can move is around(it's under my skin), so I dont know if it rules out any of those.Since some cancers are genetic, I've considered some of these possible, because my brother had cancer a few years ago and his first symptom was a lump on his neck/jaw, however, I don't really know much about these sort of things, so I'm not sure at all.I have had some iron problems in the past, but those were solved fairly quickly with a high iron diet for about 6 months, so I'm not sure if perhaps they came up again. I had a doctor's appointment for headaches in early september, and they said that I was fine when it came to iron, but I think that's the only test they did.Thanks!",

            "answer": "The one sided headaches- likely migraines (sounds like the kind of headache you are describing).\u00a0\u00a0They are very painful and you should get a plan to deal with those.\u00a0\u00a0You might visit the migraineure's support group on this website for a lot of suggestions and support.Have you had your blood sugar level tested since these symptoms came on?\u00a0\u00a0A person can lose a lot of weight (though typically very hungry) without trying if they have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You can also feel tired from it.How about your TSH & thyroid function?\u00a0\u00a0 The thyroid,when off-kilter can really throw the emotional situation out of wack.Do you think the movable lump on the jaw is causing all the pain, or do you think the jaw joint itself is a problem (any clicking, or popping or pain in the joint when yawning, opening the mouth wide, chewing, or talking)?\u00a0\u00a0TMJ problems might be one of your problems, but you really should get that lump checked out, because that doesn't sound related to me.Have you ever heard of dysautonomia?\u00a0\u00a0A number of your symptoms can happen to someone with dysautonomia (see forum on medhelp).\u00a0\u00a0I myself have postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0This makes my heart race often when in a standing/upright position.\u00a0\u00a0It also can make me light headed (common to people with dysautonomia) and make my vision start to gray or white out with standing or raising an arm at times.\u00a0\u00a0I can get short of breath from the tachycardia.\u00a0\u00a0Nausea is listed also as a dysautonomia potential symptom on pots place site.If you have in addition to the headaches & mood swings, sweating and high blood pressure episodes and tachycardia (heartbeat going to fast), you might ask the doctor if they would order a fasting plasma free metanephrines test to rule out pheochromocytoma, a rare but very serious tumor.It's definitely time to get your iron rechecked (and get a ferritin and T.I.B.C. or total iron binding capacity) .\u00a0\u00a0A lot can happen in nearly 3 months time, especially to a menstruating female.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms of iron deficiency, even if your CBC is normal, can be tachycardia, shortness of breath, light headedness, fatigue, and I think headache as well.\u00a0\u00a0So, please get it rechecked!",

            "answer": "yes. a doctor mentioned the possibility of migraines to me before, so I can see that as one of the problems...thanksI have not had my blood sugar tested in a long time, but I have a question about Diabetes then. Is it genetic? If it is...then I don't think I have it because there hasn't been anyone in my family (including aunts, uncles, grandparents, etc) that have had diabetes, but I don't know how that works, really.As for thyroid function, a counselor that I saw said that was a possibility too. I'll bring that up to my doctor...Well, originally, it was he lump itself that hurt, but now the lump is sort of numb and everything around it hurts. Yawning, talking a lot, eating, and coughing all make my jaw and neck hurt.I've heard the term, but I've never known what it was. That sounds....possible. Again, I'll bring it up to my doctor.I'm not sure about the high blood pressure, but I'll take that into question.Ok, I will. I am a vegetarian as well, but I eat a lot of high iron food. I'll get my blood tested though.",

            "answer": "I thought of something later- if you haven't already or this type of headache is a new thing, you should talk to your doctor about getting a brain scan (cat or MRI), hopefully with and without contrast.\u00a0\u00a0They really should have done that already, but if they haven't, it should get done!\u00a0\u00a0My mom had the worst headache she'd ever had, her first migraine and they did a catscan and discovered a meningioma on her brain.\u00a0\u00a0Some people have a blood vessel defect that can cause problems, so they should look for tumors or blood vessel abnormalities.I'm not sure about type one (or juvenile onset) diabetes, but diabetes type II does not have to be inherited and can happen to\u00a0\u00a0even younger people when they have certain risk factors.\u00a0\u00a0I have some friends whose daughter was discovered to have juvenile onset diabetes & I don't know of anyone in their family that has the same thing.Regarding the dysautonomia, you might see if you can get to a cardiologist or electrophysiologist and get a tilt table test.",

Yes eveything seems to be taking a very long time and symptoms haven't really been getting worse since my last appt but they haven't been getting better either. I was told that my iron was ok.
