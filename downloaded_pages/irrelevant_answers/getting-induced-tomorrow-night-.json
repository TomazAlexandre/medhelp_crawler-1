    "question": "Guhhhh, 40 weeks and getting induced for gestational hypertension :( and to make things more stressful I am not dilated nor is my cervix \"ripe\" so the inducing me is going to take longer ;( I was hoping so bad to have a natural birth and I am slowly losing hope... Have any of you ladies been induced and still managed not to have any pain medication?",
