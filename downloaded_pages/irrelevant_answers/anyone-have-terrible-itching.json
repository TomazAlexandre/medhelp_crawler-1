            "answer": "Thanks. So I know I am not alone. It seemed to subside today.Last night I almost called the ambulance. My husband was at school. With the itching the night before, last night around 7:30 I thought I was having a heart attack. Didn't know what it was--anxiety (but wasn't nervously thinking about anything), heartburn or my heart. So I covered all my bases--popped an ativan, took two tums and after about 20 minutes it went away. My whole chest hurt and my back also. I guess I better tell the doctor just in case. But I think it was heartburn from eating too fast. Scarry though.",

            "answer": "Yes I have the same problem. I am on carbo.taxol so could be the carbo.\u00a0\u00a0I called them \"itching attacks\" and last about 1/2 hour.\u00a0\u00a0Mine hits me during the chemo or a few days later and on arms mostly...Have to control myself cause I don't realize how sensitive my skin is until I see the scratch marks the next day. I use aloe vera gel.. During my last chemo, where I was given a higher dosage of carbo, the itching attack started almost immediately...had to buzz the nurse and ask her to reduce the drip speed. I think it's a kind of reaction.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know what doctor saysHow about sensation of being bitten?? Anyone have this experience? About 10 days after chemo, I feel like I am being bitten by insects on various parts of my torso. They are not itchy, just feel like a bite.\u00a0\u00a0When I get these, I tell myself that it's the cancer cells being zapped by the chemo!!",
