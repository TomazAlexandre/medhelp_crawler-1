            "answer": "Hair loss due to alcohol consumption is mainly due to the fact that alcohol affects the levels of estrogen and zinc in the body, which subsequently affect hair growth.Excessive drinking RAISES the level of estrogen, high levels of estrogen result in hair loss.Excessive drinking REDUCES zinc levels in the body. Zinc is essential for healthy hair growth.In addition, constant consumption of alcohol can also induce a lower level of vitamins B and C in your body.Furthermore, folic acid levels can also fall which is also vital in maintaining healthy and strong hair.The fact that alcoholics rarely have a balanced diet can also add to vitamin deficiencies which contributes to weakened hair. Excessive alcohol consumption can lead to a number of health problems, including liver damage, heart disease, cancer and diabetes.Randy",
