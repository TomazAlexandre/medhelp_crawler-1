            "answer": "Hi Jonodaigle,I am a volunteer on this forum, not a medical professional, so I can only speak from experience of a Type I Diabetic.I have not heard of artifical sweeteners making diabetes treatment difficult. Perhaps others on this forum have had a different experience. I myself do not use artificial sweeteners because I don't like anything artificial (it also upsets my stomach) and I have learned to have my beverages and such without any sweeteners or sugar (you really can get used to that although it takes a while). I have used them, though, for years befor I stopped, but I don't recall ever having problems with my sugar from using them. Have you or someone you know experienced problems when using these sweeteners?",

            "answer": "It might be a coincidence but you never know. Technically sweeteners shouldn't contain significant amounts of carbohydrates (they do contain a little) to affect your glucose level, but perhaps it could be other things in these sweeteners that contribute to this reaction. Maybe you can try to have a drink without anything once, just to see if that makes any difference. Like, let's say you could have a drink with the splenda one day and then the next day try to have it without aything at around the same time so that nothing else would interfere with the test (such as any food you may consume or activity level). Other than that it's hard to determine exactly what's causing this reaction...",

            "answer": "Another thing that can cause sugar levels changing is caffeine, which is often found in various drinks. In my case, caffeine stimulates my adrenal glands to produce more cortisol and this hormone is an insulin-resistant hormone. So elevated levels make the sugar levels rise for a while. So look at caffeine as a possible problem in sugar-free drinks.I personally have never noticed any sugar level change at all when I use artificial sweeteners of any of the popular brands.",
