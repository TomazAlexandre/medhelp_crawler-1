            "answer": "I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis with chronically high TPO antibodies, and I have neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0It can also be associated with Celiac Disease and/or Gluten Sensitivity, Pernicious Enema and other autoimmune and neurological disorders.\u00a0\u00a0It is not uncommon to have Hashimoto's and other co-autoimmune conditions.\u00a0\u00a0They can pile on.\u00a0\u00a0Neuropathy is also very common with Diabetes.A TSH of 5 is not \"normal\" on some labs.\u00a0\u00a0The lab that I go to a 5 is above range.\u00a0\u00a0Those reference ranges are way too broad.\u00a0\u00a0A healthy person will have a TSH between 1 and 2 and that is where \"most\" people will be optimal.Good luck getting a \"full thyroid panel\" with a conventional doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You can try searching for a holisitic MDs or Nurse Practitioner or a Doctor of Osteopath or go to a Naturopath.\u00a0\u00a0They are much more open minded about running a full range of tests to get to the root causes.Good luck!!",

    "question": "hi.my uncle has sarcoidosis.\u00a0\u00a0he's about 60.\u00a0\u00a0in the past several months, he's developed neuropathy down his legs.\u00a0\u00a0they've done scans, bloodwork, checked him for diabetes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0all have come back neg.\u00a0\u00a0however, his tsh has consistently been 5.\u00a0\u00a0the neurologist and gp insist thyroid has nothing to do with his neuropathy.they've ordered all kinds of mri's (head, back, etc), but they say that the mri's probably won't show anything that's causing the neuropathy and that most neuropathy isn't pinpointed to a direct cause. they have him on a medicine, but so far it isn't helping,they haven't check thyroid antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0do you think they should be going down the thyroid path?\u00a0\u00a0doesn't it seem like they should at least check for the thyroid antibodies?\u00a0\u00a0anytime my aunt asks about thyroid, they are pretty assertive in saying that the neuropathy isn't from thyroid issues, so she doesn't feel like she can insist on them checking for thyroid antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0how does a patient try to persuade a doctor to run a test?\u00a0\u00a0just ask for it?",
