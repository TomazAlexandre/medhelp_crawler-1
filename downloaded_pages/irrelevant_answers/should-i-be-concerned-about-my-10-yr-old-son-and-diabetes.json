            "answer": "Hi harley,as you may already know we are not medical professionals here but volunteers living with or caring for someone who has diabetes. I have had Type I diabetes for 12 years. As far as your son's symptoms are concerned I think whether or not it's diabetes you should have him get checked out by his pediatrician. Throwing up, having problems eating and all the other symptoms you've mentioned seem to be causing your son discomfort, and since you can't be sure of the reasons why he feels this way my advice is to check him out regardless. It may just be a summer thing, like you mentioned, but it's better to know for sure. As far as your son being diabetic: one of the major symptoms is unusual thirst and frequent urination. Your son is not experiencing those, so that's a good sign. Do you have a glucometer with which you can test his sugar? He can also be feeling this way due to heat - I know I feel weak, nauseaus and lethargic during this time. I even went to the doctor many years ago but he said there really isn't much he can do: that's just my body's reaction to extreme heat. Let's hope your son's symptoms are seasonal. Nevertheless he souldn't have to suffer even if that's the case. If it does turn out that your son is diabetic, please remember that we are here to offer help and support to the best of our ability, so feel free to come back and post on the forum. Good luck to you and your son!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your words of advice, I guess I just wanted to know I wasn't a paranoid parent, he already has Asthma and I get maybe over protective at times, however, I have made him an appt. to see his Dr. at the end of the week. I will keep my fingers crossed!",

            "answer": "He may be having hypoglycemic episodes... the symptoms of nausea, paleness, clamminess, a coppery odor, and sleepiness could mean low glucose. Those symptoms should be addressed with his physician, for they are not normal everyday symptoms. If hypoglycemia, he doesn't have to live this way, for dietary changes can help him avoid these episodes. If due to virus attacks instead of hypoglycemia, they aren't things that should be happening often. If you have a family member with a glucometer, you could easily find out if those symptoms are due to hypoglycemia by simply doing a home finger ***** when he is having the symptoms. A doctor may want to do a glucose tolerance test to check his response to glucose.But, as the previous responder wrote, some of these symptoms could also be due to heat exhaustion, so if they happen after he has been active, you may want to increase hydration. Anyway, I agree that it may be smart to have him checked. We wish him the best.",

    "question": "For the last month month and a half my son has had some of these symptoms I have been reading about- I realize during the summer months kids are\u00a0\u00a0busy and just don't want to eat regularly or sleep regularly so this is what I have blamed symptoms on but need a second option- My son is 10, 1 or 2 times a week it seems, will become tired and more \"lazy\" as I call it, he will have the weird smell of breath at times, he will not eat, saying he is hungry but nothing sounds good, within hours I can depend on him becoming pale in color, throwing up, trembling and shaking - this usually happens after throwing up and then he will sleep hours. A few years ago he did have a problem wetting the bed, but I thought this was somewhat normal and hasn't had a problem for a while, but usually he will have something to drink in front of him, as far as the frequent urination, this isn't an really an issue, I guess what I am wanting is, should I be really concerned and get a DR. to see him, or chock it up to the summertime rush and watch his sugar and make him eat regularly before I panic.Thank you",
