            "answer": "Yes, it is very common for people, particularly adults to get misdiagnosed with type 2 when they actually have type 1.\u00a0\u00a0This is even more likely when it is considered that type 1 in adults may not develop so quickly as it does in children, so it may take a while before blood sugars go from high to dangerously high.While it is more likely that a diagnosis would be type 1 if the patient is of normal weight, physically active, and has normal or close to normal blood pressure and lipids, it is also possible for people who are overweight to develop type 1 diabetes.To determine the difference between type 1 and type 2, a detailed family history should be taken (gestational diabetes may turn out later to be type 1), testing for antibodies, c-peptide test (this tests how much insulin the body is producing), fasting and simulated insulin tests (looking for how much insulin is present during fasting and after eating).A further trigger for suspicion for type 1 instead of type 2 is if the medications typically given to people with type 2 (metformin is often first line treatment), make little to no impact on blood sugar.The person who is misdiagnosed with Type 2, may be accused of not following diet / taking medications when their blood sugars remain high even after they have started treatment.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "So I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes when I was 16, I am now 20 and my doctors are telling me I may be a type one. Because my previous doctors bases it on my meds. So, I want to know if this is possible? And has anyone else been misdiagnosed?also. Is it based on blood or meds?",
