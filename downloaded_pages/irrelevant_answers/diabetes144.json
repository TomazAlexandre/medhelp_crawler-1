            "answer": "Being on insulin 3 times a day and then checking my blood sugar four times a day, it's kind of hard to overeat or eat anything that would raise my blood sugar. I eat a lot of fruits, vegetables and chicken. Some nuts, too. I drink A LOT of water throughout the day. I've done very good. I've only gained 6 lbs and I'm 28 weeks already. Hopefully, you'll be okay and not need insulin but if you do, it's not as bad as it sounds. I would do whatever I have to do to make sure my baby is born healthy and strong.",
