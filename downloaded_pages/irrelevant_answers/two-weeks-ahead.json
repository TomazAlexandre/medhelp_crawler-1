            "answer": "it just means your baby is measuring 2 weeks larger than they expected. Your first ultrasound usually givse your most accurate due date and then every subsequent ultrasound can kind of tell you if your kid is on track or in your case a little larger..really shouldn't be anything to be concerned about. If the baby gets too big worst case scenario maybe they might induce you sooner just so that you can have a vaginal delivery.",

            "answer": "When i first found out i was pregnant my doctor told me i was 7 weeks, my first scan showed i only measured 6. By 13 weeks baby had grown to doctors initial date and doctor told me sometimes babies grow slower, sometimes they grow faster so sometines they will be measuring ahead of their due date. Nothing to worry about unless you find out you have gestational diabetes and that is the cause for rapid growth in the baby",
