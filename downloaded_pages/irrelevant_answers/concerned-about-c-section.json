    "question": "Ok well I will start off by saying I am 38 weeks pregnant with my first child and have gestational diabetes. My ob wants me to gave a scheduled c-section. She says that there is a higher chance of still birth and complications if I go naturaly or the baby grows to big. My baby according to ultrasound at 37 weeks weighs 6 pounds 10 ounces. Which to me does not seem large at all. I am 3 cm dialated and have 2 weeks left untill due date. I would rather wait to see if he will come on his own and try giving birth vaginaly before just deciding on a c-section.\u00a0\u00a0Is a c-section nessasary just because I have gd?",
