            "answer": "Our diabetic kitty with cushings is now getting vitamin and glucosamine tablets. It seems to make a difference. Even though she is limping she seems to have a little more energy at times ... Particularly meal times! While we have had to lift her up to the dryer where she gets her shots, she now, afer aboit 2 months on the tablets, often jumps to a stool, a perch and onto the dryer. Food is a strong motivator. She has always jumped down, but recently we have found her rsleeping on the dryer.The glucosamine is probably helping with pain, but she continues to limp on her back legs. Her belly is so big and creates weight that has to be causing her pain in her joints. Her front legs are deformed and her paws point outward, also part of the cushings. She is still loving and happy.",

Her fur has regrown in areas and that is probably due to vitamins. She gets Hartz medicine for joints which hopefully lessens pain of walking. She had an abcess drained recently near her nose, and another will probably need the same later on. With cushings you don't know what might develop next. But her purring as she snuggles up next to your face is so rewarding. Her appetite never ceases, and we have hopes she will be able to again travel with us in our motor home.",

            "answer": "As you have probably found out, cushings is extremely rare in cats. I hope you have a good vet. Our Tink was first diagnosed with diabetes, then a while later tested for cushings. The diabetes, as I understand, is often triggered by the cushings. Either way, we had started insulin twice a day and had decided we would continue as long as she was a happy cat. Vitamins and glucosamine tablets seemed to help. We gave her FortiFlora, a powder in a packet, for diahrrea as needed. Problems from the cushings disease are unpredictable and different for each cat. This site was very helpful and you will find other owners that reached out to help and provide encouragement (lynn12358 and opus88).Tink had all the common symptoms...enormous belly, lots of hair loss, extreme thirst and appetite, weak and thin legs, diarrhea once in a while, occasional litter box accidents. We used a Lantus Solarstar pen with human insulin and she didn't mind at all. We treated other things as they came up, growths, bulging eye, abcess in her mouth. Sedation was needed once and she barely recovered from that. We bought stairs for the bed when her legs got too weak to jump. Through it all she was a very loving pet and that is why we continued treatments. We ordered insulin and other items on line to help with expenses. Be sure to keep Karo syrup on hand just in case her blood sugar drops. We learned to do glucose curves. Her dose changed over time.\u00a0\u00a0There are some sites referenced in the past conversations that might help. Unfortunately there are more options for treating dogs than cats.Sadly, Tink let us know when she was ready to go. Tink went on to heaven Thursday, May 8, 2014 and waits for us at the Rainbow Bridge. If you don't know the story, look it up or ask and I'll send it. We miss her soft whispers and kitty kisses. We had her sweet face with us about 3 years more than would have been expected. Her ashes are in a wooden box to be scattered with ours when our time comes. I wish you and Tuxie many days of happy memories as you work to keep his life comfortable.\u00a0\u00a0That special bond between you and him will always be a blessing.\u00a0\u00a0If I can help please let me know.",

We stayed with Friskies canned, easiest to find nearby and not overly expensive. We fed only after her shot. She easily learned the routine ... Jump up on the dryer and start eating bowl of food, gave the shot (not on the neck but a certain area on the side) mornings one side and evenings the other side, then down on the floor to finish eating. She was so good about it. I imagine Tuxie must be black with cute white markings.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your reply. I am so sorry that Tink finally lost her fight, but she obviously had a number of happy years because of your love and care.My Tuxie was diagnosed only a few months ago and right from the start I knew something was wrong since he was resistant to the insulin. I have been doing homemade food for almost 8 years..grassfed beef and almost no carbs. I had it analyzed and it is better than anything I could buy, even the prescription stuff.After 3 weeks I changed vets, since the first one only brushed off my concerns. I have done a lot of research on insulin resistance and it was at my urging that the second vet did the Cushing's testings and ultrasound, which confirmed pituitary induced Cushing's. There are so little studies with Cushing's in cats, but I have read a couple where Trilostane (Vetoryl) has been used to help control the cortisol production. This certainly isn't a cure and has some risks, but there is no way I could have the radiation therapy or adrenal gland removals done. Tuxie has always been a very skitterish cat and just freaks out when I have to take him for a vet visit. So I want to do as much home monitoring as I can to avoid stressing him any further.I am so worried about his skin as it is already showing the thinning signs and when I do his shots he is starting to meow when I pull the skin up.I will be asking the vet about B12 injections for him and I will ask what other supplements might be of help.I am so grateful to have found this posting. Cushing's is so rare in cats that there is very little information. The fact that you were able to give Tink those extra years gives me hope for some extra quality time for my Tuxie. He is only 14 and I had really hoped that I would have many more years with him...but only if he has quality time.Again I am so sorry to hear that Tink has passed, but you did a small miracle by giving her all that extra time.",
