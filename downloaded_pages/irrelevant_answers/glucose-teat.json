            "answer": "It's to test you for gestational diabetes which you can get when your pregnant if you don't maintain a good diet. I took mine at like 28wks, you just drink the Orange drink which tastes like orange crush soda, sit for an hour then they take your blood and your done. Mine took like an hour and a half and I didn't have to fast, just don't eat or drink anything with sugar before your test because it will throw off your results and you'll have to go back in for the 3hr test.",

            "answer": "It is very necessary! It determines whether or not you have gestational diabetes. GD can cause the baby's heart to thicken, which can cause heart problems or cause baby to grow too quickly, which is bad cause all the other organs won't have time to catch up. This I know cause I have type 2 diabetes and I have to see a perinatologist and a fetal cardiologist to make sure these things aren't happening with my baby. So far so good for me and I'm 33 weeks. Definitely get the sugar test done ASAP. You should be able to call the doctors office and have them fax the orders over to the place you need to go. Don't put this off.",
