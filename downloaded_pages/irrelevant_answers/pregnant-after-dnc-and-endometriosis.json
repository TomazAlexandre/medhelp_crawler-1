            "answer": "Hi again,A fertility specialist can answer that. I had my D&C years before I knew I had endometriosis. I did have my daughter after having the D&C but since the endo diagnosis I have not conceived. I tried IVF and that did not work. But my case was severe. It depends on your wife's individual case. Also, after they remove the adhesions I had about 6 months before the endo would get bad again. Once your wife heals that might be your best chance.Before doing anything I'd recommend seeing a fertility nutritionist. Mine believes diet has a lot to do with the illness. I have dramatically changed my diet. I hope to try to conceive again but I am taking a break right now. I have other health issues. I want to be in my best shape before I try again.Good luck to you and your wife. In the Chicago area we have the Fertility Centers of Illinois and they are excellent.",

            "answer": "I'd say your risk for pregnancy is low then. There are natural methods to preventing pregnancy. I used natural family planning, the sympto-thermal method for years. So that along with endo prevented any unplanned pregnancies.About your wife's pain. I forgot about the pain after surgery due to the gas they use for the laparoscopic procedure. The gas stays in your system for a while. Painful. I had to sleep sitting up for a while. Hope your wife recovers quickly.",
