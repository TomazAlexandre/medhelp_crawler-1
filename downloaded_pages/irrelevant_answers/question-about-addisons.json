            "answer": "You can have a low or normal cortisol test and have Cushing's.The reasons can be as follows. You can have a high Cortisol Binding globulin. Lab error. You are cyclical. You are taking a medication that is binding the free cortisol (such as estrogen) so that a free cortosol test will be inaccurate. Or it can be a combination of any of the above.I had Cyclical Pituitary Cushing's and my tests were all over the place. It took a lot of testing. The dex test is not a test of exclusion. I will fail all dex tests but my pathology will tell you I really have the disease. It does that for a lot of people. You need to see an expert who knows what he/she is doing and knows how to test and to do a lot of it. One test just will not do it.Plus I had Cushing's, PCOS and a myriad of other things - just because you have one disease unfortunately does not mean you do not have another and the Cushing's does trump all others. You do not get better until that one gets resolved.",

            "answer": "Hi; I've been progressively getting weaker and weaker for over a year now. I feel really nauceous all the time and very dizzy and faint. I passed out a little over a month ago and had to go to the E.R. but they just said it was an episode of syncope. I've also been feeling extremely exhausted, to the point where I'm barely able to stay awake now; because it has gotten worse. I also tremor all day long, and my feet twitch. I feel really irritable a lot; and it has been confirmed that I have orthostatic hypotension (my heartbeat is 80 bpm at rest; then from sitting to standing it jumps to 130 bpa everytime I stand up) but the doctors don't know what's causing it. I went to an endocrinologist two weeks ago and had a cortisol test: the dr. sent a letter to my house and said my results seemed normal, yet he put me on Florinef and said to come back after a month of taking that. I have since been feeling even worse and I've been having tenderness and stabbing pains on both the upper left and right sides of my abdomen that radiates to my back. My knuckles on my hands have also started to hyperpigment. I have also been losing weight no matter how much I increase my food intake.Something has to be wrong but I don't know what it is?",

    "question": "Just a quick question for someone out there. My Dr. is testing me for Cushing's because of the list of symptoms I have almost all of them! I have done a 24 hour urine cortisol (still waiting for the results of that) and an overnight low dose dexamethasone. Those results came back showing my cortisol was low. I know with Cushing's it should have been high right? All I could find on the web was for a low cortisol is Addison's. With that I read that you lose weight but I have gained around 60 pounds in the last year. When my Dr gets my urine results back he is going to call me but I am just curious about all of this. My rheumatologist has dx me with MCTD and \"some kind of autoimmune arthritis\" but my pcp is just convinced something else is going on and so he is the one pursuing all these other things.",
