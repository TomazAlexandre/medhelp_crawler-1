I was sent to the opthamologist and he said that I had something where my retina was leaking fluid...at the time, I didn't know I was pregnant. Now that we know I'm pregnant they said it was due to that, and that my vision should return completely after the first trimester. Weird, I know.",

It should stabilize within 6 months post-baby.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there.",
