            "answer": "Very normal...fruits & veggies are great for this, as you can eat these in unlimited amounts while pregnant. They are packed with the good nutrition baby needs, low cal for you, & are high in fiber so will fill you up longer, as well as helping you ease common pregnancy discomforts such as constipation. It may not always seem as appetizing as other comfort foods, but will pay off in the long run by keeping your first trimester weight gain low & provide great nutrion for baby. The benefits of this is a lower chance of developing gestational diabetes and less stretch marks too.",
