            "answer": "Hello,There is no scientific basis that prostate massage can improve sex drive. Cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and diabetes can reduce blood flow to the body, including the genitals. Similarly conditions such as thyroid disorders and tumors of the pituitary gland (which controls most hormone production, including sex hormones) can also lower libido.In such a case, a detailed evaluation by your doctor along with investigations like EKG, cardiac stress test, blood sugar levels, thyroid profile and CT head to rule out any pituitary tumors are helpful.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
