            "answer": "Sorry, I missed this post.\u00a0\u00a0Was on vacation.Its really important to let your psyc know that your son has DM.\u00a0\u00a0 That could account for a lot of his symptoms. For example, Irritability and other mood changes,fatigue and weakness are common symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0This would also make a kid very depressed. It would also explain why they had a problem pinning down his problems as they would shift due to the DM.From what you mentioned in your other post he sounds like he has ADHD and that is causing a lot of the other problems.However, if you decide to try and treat with stim meds - he must go off the Fluoxetine (Prozac).\u00a0\u00a0It blocks the effects of the stim med and lets it back up and cause bigger problems.I very much doubt he is bipolar at this age.I really think that the diabetes needs to be dealt with first.\u00a0\u00a0Getting that under control will also help with some of his symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 Then I would take a serious look at the ADHD.\u00a0\u00a0But one step at a time.\u00a0\u00a0 First, let the psyc know about the DM and see about slowly tapering off the Fluoxetine.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in touch and let me know what happens.\u00a0\u00a0Feel free to post if you have any more questions.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and your English really is pretty good.",
