Eventually had to go on some meds to keep my sugars in better check.\u00a0\u00a0Sugars werent horrible, usually 130s-160s lunch and dinner time. I took myself off the meds and was controlling my sugars with better discipline lol. And walking more after I feel like I've eaten a little too much carbs. I guess being pregnant doesn't mean you can eat whatever you want haha",

            "answer": "Be careful with the fruits too. they're naturally high in sugar too. See if you can find like the plate method of eating or something like that lol. It shows how much of each you should be eating. The diabetes nurse I saw at my high risk ob gave me a meal plan of how many carbs should be eaten at each meal with less eaten in the morning. And snacks in between. Usually pair carbs with tons of protein to keep you more stabilized",

            "answer": "Hi,I'm 33w tomorrow and I'm diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes.I did pretty well on diet, but kept failing my before breakfast morning blood sugar test.Then occassionally I would fail my bloodsugar test after dinner (not often, but it did happen).So I started on insulin two weeks ago, it really works beautifully.Gestational Diabetes has many side-effects, and severe hunger is one. Which I have.I have never been hungry like this before.. I'm usually not big on food and usually eat poorly, small portions and skipping meals etc etc.. and never usually have apetite or real hunger feelings.So to me, this is quite new.What I find helping is -occupy your mind, get busy, do your exercises.. healthy small snacks.Trick yourself that you're full, drink heaps of water ;)It is essential to stay on top of your bloodsugar levels, for your own and your baby's long life's health. Yes.Testing your blood all the time and if you also on top of that take insulin, even worse.Keeping a logbook for food and sugar level readings.. it is like your life is all about it.Planning all your meals carefully.It is HARD and I sometimes feel that people don't understand it..but remember, all this effort is for your baby who really needs it and for you.Also, only 1/3 continue to have diabetes after delivery.. so it is most likely time limited.Another positive thing is that you'll not be overdue.Your OB/doctor will ensure you don't go past your due date.. so you'll have a better idea when you got your baby :)",
