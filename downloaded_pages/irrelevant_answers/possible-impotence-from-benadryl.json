    "question": "I have had an experience similar to the Gentleman who wrote inabout Impotence from Drugs. I have been taking Excedrin PM to getto sleep because of a stressful job. I noticed my erections werea bit soft and then I finally couldn't obtain one over the last 6 to 12 months, though I can obtain an orgasm. Some of my feelings with the cold penis and lack of sensation were similarto his. The feeling is starting to come backI talked to a nurse hotline and was told incredients in ExcedrinPM can cause impotence. I am off that product for about 10 days and may be seeing some improvement(it's difficult to tell, yet).I had my blood pressure checked by my physician and it's around132-134/82-84 which is reasonable for someone who is 51. My physician doubts diabetes or liver problems based on my generalhealth and appearance.I am having a physical done on Saturday. There is no history ofdiabetes in my immediate family. I have a varicoscele since childhood.1) How long should it take for symptoms from medication to wearoff?2) How effective is Viagra, Cialis, and Levitra in treating theseproblems?3) Can a varicoscele cause ED problems and in what way?4) How much time do I have to get treated? I'm concerned aboutbeing able to recover. The Viagra studies show that the averageage is around 57 and the average duration of impotence was about5 years with a range from 0 to 10 years.",
