            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!There are many causes for increased urinary frequency in kids. Extraordinary day time frequency syndrome is one. Here the child produces small quantity of urine frequently and the symptoms go away in 3-4 months. Stress is usually thought to be the cause.The other reason could be incomplete voiding. This can happen if the child is in a hurry to pass urine. The child stops the urine flow voluntarily and since the bladder is not empty, it will fill up again. You can talk to your son regarding this, and train him and put him on a schedule to pass urine every 2-4 hours to start with and slowly increase the gap.There are medical causes too like diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus. Small for size bladder is another possibility. Please consult an urologist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,My 8 y/o son has been urinating a little more often that I notice this summer. He doesn't have many other symptoms. The only other thing that has change since spring is nosebleeds that could be due to allergies. I have taken him twice to be seen for both issues. First time they did a urine test to check for UTI and ***** his finger to test for sugar. That was about a month ago and both came out fine. Took him to his regular dr.'s and did a urine test again and that came out fine, but no sugar test. Should I be concerned that it could be diabetes or something much worse? The only other person in our family that I know has diabetes is his great uncle. No one that close just yet.",
