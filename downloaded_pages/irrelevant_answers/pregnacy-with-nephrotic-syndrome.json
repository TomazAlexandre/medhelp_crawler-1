You are at increased risk to have preeclampsia in a subsequent pregnancy if you had preeclampsia in a previous one. The risk is increased depending on both the severity and time when the disorder first appeared in the first pregnancy. The earlier In pregnancy you developed preeclampsia and the more severe the disorder the more likely it is to recur.To improve the outcome check with a doctor for detailed evaluation of your blood pressure and kidney function.\u00a0\u00a0Continue taking losartan. Clotting function should be assessed if you have had vein clots before. You\u00a0\u00a0gynecologist should check why you are taking prednisolone.Try to lose weight if obese, it reduces\u00a0\u00a0risk of developing eclampsia again.
