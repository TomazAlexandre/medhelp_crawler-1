            "answer": "Yours is a very interesting and puzzling post.\"Is this a normal OGTT?? \"No. At 10:55 your levels should be between 3.9 and 5.7 mmol/l, close to where you started, 4.8 mmol/l.\"Is it normal having problems after a OGTT keeping sugars up?\"No. In the diabetes world you are experiencing what they call hypoglycaemic episodes [hypoglycemia] - low blood sugars after eating [postprandial]. I can only assume your endo has tested your pancreas, your pituitary, thyroid and adrenal glands, and liver functions for abnormalities.One of the most important thing to do is to change your diet/nutrition opposite of an type 2 diabetic. It should consist of a lot of carbohydrates - potatoes, white breads, white rice, pasta, etc - and be divided into more, but smaller meals - breakfast, lunch, dinner and three in-between meals - to avoid the big fluctuations in the insulin secretion from the pancreas. Carbs when digested quickly enter the bloodstream as sugar.According to Wiki, the term \"dysautonomia (autonomic dysfunction) is a broad term that describes any disease or malfunction of the autonomic nervous system.\" I suppose in order are consultations with a Neurologist with specialty in autonomic disorders, and a Cardiologist with specialty in electrophysiology. Sorry, but this way above my area of knowledge and limits my response in this area. Might consider posting on the Ask A Doctor - Autoimmune Disorders and Neurology - forums. Good luck",

            "answer": "Would it be correct for me to say that my one hour reading should have been the higher reading of 6.3? And then at the two hour mark my sugars should have started dropping back to my starting numbers?I have not had any additional tests as of yet this is my first test ordered by my endocrinologistIn regards to the dysautonomia I believe my endocrinologist is thinking because I have higher levels of adrenaline and that it is causing my body to constantly be lowering my blood sugar. I have Hyperadrenergic POTS (postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome) I have a overeractive sympathetic response to standing, the autonomic testing I have had done showed I have very little parasympathetic response and am always dumping/have a spillover of adrenaline.. And that its the excessive amounts of adrenaline/stress hormones that may be causing this?However,I was under the impression that adrenaline caused glucose to be released from the kidneys and in turn it would cause blood sugar to rise???? But I also suppose that adrenaline is not the only stress hormone and each would affect sugars differently. I really do not know much about diabetes so I again may be wrong! :)",

            "answer": "\"Would it be correct for me to say that my one hour reading should have been the higher reading of 6.3? And then at the two hour mark my sugars should have started dropping back to my starting numbers?\"This would be a good assumption. After fasting normal glucose levels are 60/70 to 99 mg/dl. With an OGTT, at 1 hour normal levels are <111.1 mmol/l [<200 mg/dl], 2 hours <7.77 mmol/l [<140 mg/dl]. For reactive hypoglycemia, the OGTT does not really apply as other factors come into play. Mostly used to help determine hyperglycemia.\"However,I was under the impression that adrenaline caused glucose to be released from the kidneys and in turn it would cause blood sugar to rise????\"Adrenaline raises glucose levels by stimulating the liver to change glycogen into glucose. When normal glucose regulation fails with type 2 diabetics, the kidneys are forced to remove excess glucose via the urinary tract. This usually is caused by insulin deficiency. In your case this does not apply.I have read that one of the common symptoms of POTS is reactive hypoglycemia, lowering of glucose. Researchers have come to understand that this lowering of glucose levels is not the only cause, because patients\u2019 bodies are also producing excessive amounts of adrenaline and other stress hormones.This site, The Serotonin Connection, better explains the connection between overproduction of adrenalin and stress and hypoglycemia.http://tinyurl.com/adrenaline-stress-overproductiLastly, search on how the pancreas produces insulin. Specifically the Islet and Beta cells.",

Get your hands on a digital voice recorder and record what he/she has to say - it will become a good friend to you. At home you can review what was spoken as many times as needed. This also gives you an opportunity to look up medical words/terms which they unknowingly use.",

            "answer": "Does a beta blocker have any effect on any of this? I am reading on how the pancreas produces insulin and that beta cells make and secrete insulin. I take 25 mg of atenolol 2x daily. I do know they can block the symptoms of hypoglycemia...But do they have any effect on the beta cells. Sorry for my numerous questions :)",

    "question": "Hello!I am not sure if I can post this here but since I am being tested for diabetes and reactive hypoglycemia.I have been seeing an endocrinologist because I am constantly having low blood sugar readings and have had a high fasting blood glucose test of 8.3. My endocrinologist feels this may be due to my dysautonomia. She thought maybe reactive hypoglycemia because I am having low fasting glucose levels as well as high.I went for a 2hr OGTT today and I am feeling horrible after the test.My baseline was 4.8 @ 8:55Given 75g of glucose to drinkAt 4.3 @ 9:25At 4.8 @ 9:55At 6.2 @ 10:25At 6.3 @ 10:55After the test I went to eat something and started feeling very shaky and out of it at about 11:30. I took my blood sugar and it was 3.0. So I took 15g of dex (glucose) tabs.I tested again and I was 5.3 And ate my lunch. Again, 30 min after my blood sugar dropped from 4.1. Its been dropping within a half hour now all day and I am constantly trying to keep it up despite drinking/eating and snacking.Is this a normal OGTT?? Is it normal having problems after a OGTT keeping sugars up? Thank you!!!",
