            "answer": "Your symptoms sound more like hypoglycemia to me than diabetes, but if you want a true answer, go without the soda and have your doctor run some lab tests to get a real answer to what your glucose levels are doing. The soda addiction may have caused your body to become so accustomed to this heavy onslaught of sugar that you now get hypo when you don't drink it. It certainly is not a healthy addition to anybody's diet, but you may need to wean off of it more slowly.But all in all, the symptoms you describe sound very much like very low blood sugar. You may do well to drink a little milk when you feel this way (it is a slowly-released carbohydrate that may help you feel better), or perhaps drink a small amount (like a half cup) of orange juice. You should feel better within about 15 minutes to a half hour if you are hypoglycemic. The caffiene in sodas is very addicting.",

I recently switched from coca cola to sprite because the god dam phosphoric acid has thinned my bones down so much that I don't even want to remind myself of it.

I recently switched from coca cola to sprite because the god dam phosphoric acid has thinned my bones down so much that I don't even want to remind myself of it. The worst of all is sometimes it happens all at once and I start freaking out where I start crying uncontrollably and I feel like I'm going to die.",

            "answer": "Some weeks ago I got out of bed and while standing that horrible feeling hit my body like a car crash and my ears did something crazy and all the other symptoms as well. If you've ever been to a drag race and you put your fingers in your ears to lower the sound that sort of muffled sound happened but it has this super loud strange muffled buzzing sound and I couldn't hear anything else. This is the first time this part has happened and I layed out with the sweat absolutly pouring out of me, barely able to breath, while crying I thought once again that I'm going to die because I started chugging a can of sprite and it didn't go away for like 30 mins that lasted forever.",

I stood up and both my eyes shut themselves, my left leg almost went completely numb and I could feel it shoot down, I ran to the kitchen running into walls, and once I got back to my bedroom I was sitting in the chair I chugged the can of soda in 10 seconds and I realized my entire body was so covered in sweat that it was like I had just gotten out of the shower and I was shaking. In like 15 seconds it went away. I have never taken drugs so don't even bring that up. The god dam drugs are what killed Kurt Cobain, Layne Staley, and Christ Farley. Well I guess you can say that sprite and coca cola are my drugs but its not my fault, sort of.THERE IS NO DOUBT ITS NOT JUST THE SUGAR. ITS THE HIGH FRUCTOSE CORN SYRUP that I am some how addicted to because orange juice and anything else with sugar and no high fructose corn syrup can barely hold it off and can't do **** when I start getting the horrible feelings.",

            "answer": "Like I said earlier that one horrible time both my eyes **** themselves and I couldn't open them no matter how hard I tryed and that was the main reason why I ran into a bunch of walls while running to the kitchen. When I said my eye lids feel strange [this is what has been happening today and for weeks] so that I'm just laying here or sitting and watching TV and all of a sudden when I start feeling weak everywhere my eyes and eye lids have the feeling like I just woke up and someone turned on a bright light. Also either I'm laying there on my side and its hard to open my eye lids or what just happened hours ago where I had my eyes as wide open as possible staring at the ceiling for like 15 mins because my eye lids just didn't feel like shutting or something. Some of it was that I was busy thinking about how horrible everything is but it was still strange.",

            "answer": "I need help and my parents don't have the money to help me. This **** is so scary. I need help. Maybe its better that I just lay it bed and die. No one cares anyways. Things are starting to get worse because each can of sprite is working less and less just right now I drink 5 cans of sprite in like 2 hours because it just keeps coming back. I'm almost puking and my stomach hurts so much but then it comes back and again and again. If I ever do go to the doctor what tests are they going to do to me and what else can I expect? How much is this going to cost? What is going to happen to me if I don't get help soon or ever? My is this happening to me? I think my aunt also has diabetes to so this might be a genetic thing?",

            "answer": "These days while laying in bed I can feel fine but when I sit up it seems like every other day to 5 times a day I feel alittle to a lot light headed and then I start getting weak and I know I need the sprite to stop it before it starts getting too bad. I always drink a can of spirte before going to bed and 1 or 2 cans when I wake up because my blood sugar gets low while I'm asleep and I always start to have the bad feelings when I wake up. I drink 1 glass of water every once in awhile because it feels like it getting rid of all of the sugar out of my blood even though I know thats not what its doing but not very long later I need another sprite that I probably wouldn't of needed if I didn't drink the water. That doesn't make any sense but its true.",

    "question": "I've been addicted to soda for most of my life and I never knew why and now I'm sure its because I've always had type 1 diabetes. From like age 13 up my current age of 20 I've drank 6 - 10 cans of soda everyday with no water ever and rarely exercised. When I go without it for too long [my blood sugar gets to low] I become so weak it like all of my muscles are starting to stop working and it feels like my organs too. I can barely walk in a straight line, my legs feel like spaghetti, it takes all my strength to open the refridgerator, lifting my hand up is a challlenge, opening my mouth is super hard so I just mumble and my eye lids won't act normal, I get the worst strange feeling in my entire chest and mid region like I said all my muscles and organs are shutting down, if it goes on too long I start shaking, and lately sweat pours out of every last inch of my body litterly like a waterfall and after I have barely moved for hours for no reason and I'm so freezing that I'm shaking while this happens sometimes, most of the time when I start getting the horrible feeling in my chest I'm either breathing hard or gasping for air like someone is sitting on my chest and once it got so bad that I had to use my bed side air cleaner as a respirator by sleeping with my mouth as wide open as possible with it on high blowing right in my mouth.",
