            "answer": "Just hang in there. All my life I was rail thin, no illness but over the years, I've gained weight. My heaviest was at 224. A couple of years ago, I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, high cholesterol and high blood pressure. I was put on medicine, was told to diet and exercise. Like you, I dont work out and didnt like fruits or veggies. I ate what I wanted and didnt think too much about it. Well, each time I visit my doctor, my situation had not improved and at the time, I didnt know that my situation was progressing worse until my OBGyn told me that I may have to get on insulin shots. That was my wake up call. I dont want to be on insulin so I sought out help and this website is helping me. At home, I have support, but most of my support comes from enablers -- my husband brings stuff (junk food, sweets etc.) in the house knowing I do not have the will power to resist temptation. Not only that, he is active in sports, so we very seldom have time to prepare a healthy, nutritious meal....so we stick to fast food restaraunts...not good!If you want to change, set goals for yourself. It is a lifestyle change. I am learning that too many carbs are not my friend. One thing you may want to look into is the Food Lovers Fat Loss program. I like the program because it gives you tools that you can use like learning how to eat the right combination of everyday foods (low carbs, fast carbs, protein) that will boost your metabolism and help you lose weight.As far as exercising, start off slow. Just take a 10 - 15 minute walk each day until you can build up endurance. Do fun activities like Zumba. (Nope, you do not need to know the steps or how to dance, the key is to keep moving lol) If you have an xbox with Kinet, they offer a variety of fun games that gets you off of the sofa and moving around.Another thing, drink your water!!! You can do this!!! Take it from me, together we can overcome obesity!!! Keep your head up and remember, you are beautiful inside and out!!!",
