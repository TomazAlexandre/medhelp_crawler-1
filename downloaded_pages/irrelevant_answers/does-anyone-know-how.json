            "answer": "at 36+1, baby is not considered full term by any standards. so why the rush? It may not be safe if you haven't been trained, and baby is probably going to be in for a few more weeks anyway.I understand that it's exciting and it ***** that you're already having contractions (32+5 with twins, contracting for over a week) but effacement and dilation can happen over the course of a month or just a couple hours. please don't check yourself if you don't know what you're doing because the information will not tell you when baby is coming.",
