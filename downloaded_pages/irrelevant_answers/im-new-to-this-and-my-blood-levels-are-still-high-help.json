            "answer": "I also have gestational diabetes and I have found that cutting out breads has helped. I also am following a low carb diet, meaning 20 g of carbs per meal and 15 g for snacks also increasing my protein has helped. I eat about 120 g of protein a day.",

            "answer": "Hi, how are you going now.GD is a moving ship... because as the pregnancy progresses blood sugars become even harder to manage.Lowering numbers is best done eating low carb (this may be opposite what the dietician has told you).\u00a0\u00a0Many still recommend high carb for diabetes.When i was pregnant I ate very low carb.\u00a0\u00a0And I also took insulin.\u00a0\u00a0My diet consisted of meat, eggs, nuts, cheese, cream, plenty of non-starchy vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0I avoid grains most of the time and also sugars, sweets, and most fruits.If you are not able to manage your blood sugar with diet and exercise, then you will need medications.\u00a0\u00a0The most commonly used medication in pregnancy is injected insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Don't be scared of using insulin, it is really a very helpful medication when needed.\u00a0\u00a0Using insulin and lower carb eating can be what you need to have a healthy pregnancy with a beautiful healthy baby as the outcome.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Thank you for all your input! I have found that by cutting out all bread and keeping it as low carb as possible has controlled my numbers. I am still lower in carbs than my dietician wants, but it is working for me and I get plenty of nutrients, so I am slightly shucking her recommendation. She wants me to get between 175-200g of carbs a day, but I find keeping it between 150-170 works best for me. I'm going to keep this up to see if I can make it to the end without meds/insulin.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed on Saturday with GD. I have been strictly following the guidelines for carbs and exercise since then. I just received my blood sugar monitor yesterday. My numbers were okay yesterday, but today they are very high. I have been well within the range of carb/sugar intake the dietician recommended. I have also exercised faithfully each day. I followed the no fruit/dairy at breakfast and dinner snack recommendation, as well.\u00a0\u00a0What else can I do to lower these numbers?",
