I only ask because it is common for my husband ((normally in the Summer)) to have the same reaction on his arm - his itches so bad - he itches it raw and nothing helps - someone said it could be his sugar levels...just a thought...I will find out more and post if I get more info...I'm also not sure if herpes causes the same symptoms you are describing? That can be brought about by stress...again - just throwing that out there...",

            "answer": "i agree with Deeds. I hear that viral infections can cause hives.\u00a0\u00a0It sound like the one on your finger might be some type of herpes and it has triggered your body to produce hives. My personal belief is that sometimes taking antihistamines can make it worse. My hives got significantly worse after taking zyrtec. I can't back it up with science but somehow the meds made my immune system react even more violently.",

    "question": "I don't know if all this is connected but it maybe so so I'll post all the info I have. About the end of February of '07 I had a tiny cluster of little bumps on one finger that was itchy and slowly it seemed to get worse until it was like a good size open wound on my finger, very oozy , would get crust then ooze again, I was travelling at the time and finally got it to a doctor, they thought impetigo(also by that time I have what to me looked to be hives), gave antibiotics (not sure the specific kind) next morning after taking one pill I had loads of little red bumps all over me, but mostly on arms , hands face and feet. Went back to doctor (different one) he took me off antibiotics (Idunno if they actually caused that reaction or if it was just coincidence), put me on fucidin cream, prednisolone, and told me to keep taking antihistimes which I had been taking unsuccessfully for these supposed hives. After a week it all basically seemed to clear up , then a week later nothing but those red bumps came back but only on my upper arm, hands, and around my lips. It's been about two months since then and it's still here, I've been to my family doctor, a dermatologist and everyone gave me steriod creams and so on for ezcema (which did nothing especially for my lips since I can't even put it on there) and I've stopped using all porducts for a dermatologist reccommended one that didn't help, it's not my detergent, it's not food that I can see, in fact I can see no pattern with this at all, it will just start to seem to go away randomly but before it's even completely cleared it's will always come back in those same places. I don't know what to do at this point but it's driving me nuts, it looks terrible and is very itchy... help!",
