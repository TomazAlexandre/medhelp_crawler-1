            "answer": "I'm a preexisting diabetic, and they'll watch your sugars and if too high after food control they will possibly put you on pills and/or shots. You might need to be induced (depending on sugars and baby size), if you have gestational diabetes they will probably put baby in nicu for a little bit to make sure baby is completely fine as diabetes and gestational diabetes can cause some problems. Preterm labor doesn't happen often, if you weren't at risk for pre term before your risk isn't increased.",

            "answer": "I got gd its not a big deal as long as you watch your carb intake. They'll give you a monitor to test your blood sugar 4 times a day. Also they'll tell you what you can and can't eat and what to eat little of. I can tell you the things I found out I cannot eat at all is cereal, poptarts, and not more than 2 slices of pizza. Its not a big deal as long as you watch what you eat you'll be fine and if your sugars are still high they'll put you on a medicine. Mine stay where they're suppose to be because I just no longer eat my carb full breakfasts and for lunch and dinner you have to eat less bread, rice, beans and pasta. I can actually eat a good amount of pasta before my sugars get to high. And you can still eat those things just not a lot it has to be a smaller portion. You're fine lots of women. Get it.",

            "answer": "Babies can be in the nicu for trouble maintaining blood sugars mine was anyway. I was induced early because the baby was big. From what my endocrinologist tells me if your sugars are high the baby produces more insulin which can make bigger babies. If you can maintain your sugars you'll be placed on insulin but most women can manage with diet and exercise. I had GD the first time and have preexisting this pregnancy. You will have a higher chance of diabetes in the future ive been told aswell. I got regular diabetes a year after having my first.",

    "question": "I had to take the 3 hour test yesterday and almost got sick and passed out. But they called back today and I missed the call so I'm waiting for them to call back. I've always been told no news is good news,\u00a0\u00a0so I'm guessing I have gestational diabetes since they called today. And I'm freaking out. All the research I've done have mentioned babies possibly being in NCIU, having jaundice, pre-term labor, etc. I'm just curious as to what your experiences were and how the doctors treated you? How was labor?",
