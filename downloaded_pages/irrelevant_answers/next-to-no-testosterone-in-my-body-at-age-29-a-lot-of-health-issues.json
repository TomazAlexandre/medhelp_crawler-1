    "question": "I got the results of a blood test this past Friday. I only have a level of 42 testosterone. The normal level is in the 320 to 1200 range. I am only 29 years old. I have been struggling with extremely low energy and strange aches and pains all over my body for the past several months. I was first sent to get a sleep study and came back as having moderate sleep apnea. After a month of treatment, my symptoms still hadn't improved so I went back to my primary care doc and asked him to do a work up on other things that can cause energy issues, including low t. My vitamin d was also severely low (I work in an office). Anyway. I've been reading about all the different possible causes of low testosterone and I'm just really concerned. My current energy levels are not normal at all. My mood is always terrible. I can barely go and I keep getting these weird electric shock type pains all over my body at different times of the day. I also have lost a lot of my hearing in my right ear. It's like my body is all of a sudden falling apart. I also have high blood pressure and have had problems with opiate dependence in the past. I've been clean for several years, though. I guess my question is what happens next\u00a0\u00a0now that I've been diagnosed with low t. I'm supposed to go back into the primary care office this Monday for further testing, and the doc mentioned that he may be sending me to an endocrinologist. Could this be cancer?",
