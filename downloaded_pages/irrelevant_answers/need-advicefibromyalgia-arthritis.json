    "question": "In 2009 I was having some really bad pain going down my leg and into my foot. I had a MRI done and found out I had a herniated disc, spinal stenosis and degenerative disc disease. Since then I had my second child. He's 3 mths old now. I didn't have too many issues. My back didn't bother me as much as I thought it would but now for the past couple mths my whole body hurts all the time. Mainly my joints and muscles. It feels like I've been hit by train every day. I have IBS and currently taking zoloft for postpartum depression. The vicodon I take for my back no longer works for the pain and I contsantly feel drained.\u00a0\u00a0My hands are tingling all the time, go numb and pain extends out to both elbows. Almost like cramping pain. It's been really bad and comes on very easily. I feel like I'm falling apart. Any ideas would help.",
