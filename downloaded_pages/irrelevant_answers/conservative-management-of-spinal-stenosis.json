            "answer": "Dear Mr. Jones:Not having seen your MRI showing the canal stenosis it is difficult for me to give an accurate opinion.\u00a0\u00a0I guess the initial question that must be asked, is the degeneration idopathic (no known reason) or is it due to a degenerative process such as arthritis, diabetes, collagen vascular disorders etc?\u00a0\u00a0If there is a progress etiology then the problem will definitely get worse.\u00a0\u00a0Surgery in that case would be the correct course.\u00a0\u00a0If the etiology is unknown, the degeneration is only at the spinal level mentioned, you are in otherwise good health, fit, correct weight, non-smoking, non-drinking, non-physical jobor career, then you might have an option of waiting.\u00a0\u00a0But, I think that I would seek opinions from other medical personal.\u00a0\u00a0This would include rehab physicians and especially neurology.\u00a0\u00a0Weight the fact, concerns and probabilities from what you gather and make an informed decision.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "How can I find a physician with expertise in conservative management of lumbar spinal stenosis?\u00a0\u00a0I have consulted several spine surgeons, all of whom (of course) have suggested surgery to help my problem of bilateral paresthesia in the feet and ankles when standing or walking erect.\u00a0\u00a0I experience NO PAIN.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms are completely relieved by bending forward, sitting, or lying down.\u00a0\u00a0I can walk or stand erect only for 5-8 minutes before the onset of tingling and numbness beginning in both feet.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, I can walk indefinitely using a short cane which allows me to walk bending forward.\u00a0\u00a0I can also walk by leaning forward on a shopping cart or walker.\u00a0\u00a0MRI shows degenerative stenosis at L4-L5.I am seeking alternatives to surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any?",
