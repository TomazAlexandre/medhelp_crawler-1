            "answer": "The fructosamine test is a good indicator.Our Hildiekatt Halfshadow of fond memory was diagnosed with diabetes and we gave her insulin for almost 2 years before the diabetes went into remission.The frustosamine tests helped us to lower her dosage over time.Unfortunately, she developed intestinal lymphoma, the same illness that took her sister Silver Kestrel's life 2 years before.",

            "answer": "Hi Ms Vicky,Boy I learn something new every day with the questions our posters ask.Today I learned about Blood Sugar.From what I have researched. Blood sugar will often test high 300-400 range when there is stress or infection. The normal for cats is 75-120mg.So I would say the Fructosamine level should be your go to indicator, like Pip says.Reason for this is it is not affected by stress or infection. Apparently the stress your pet feels upon going to the vet and all that goes with it can increase his Blood sugar to the high you have stated, while the Fructosamine test will test normal.I would also take a look at testing for pancreatitis, since the pancreas is what controls insulin. Sounds like your cat does have Diabetes, yes?This is why the extra thirst and urination.I think if you are near a Veterinary Teaching School, this may be the place for you and Antar. They are always\u00a0\u00a0willing to work with you, since it is a learning experience for them. Might want to check it out. I think they may even have a payment plan for you.So my advise to you would be discuss your concerns with someone from a teaching establishment. They will be able to better direct you as to which test would be most advantageous so you are not wasting more money.I should get a commission for referring people to these types of Schools.Just think they have a wealth of knowledge on \"NEW\" techniques and tests for so many medical questions.Good Luck, Mom, to you and AntarPlease keep us posted.CML",

            "answer": "I dont know why, but i didnt get any notification of your responses, or I would have replied sooner.Pipar.... I'm sorry for your loss.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't know if Antar has ever really had diabetes or not because the only times he ever had his sugar checked were when he was sick with other symptoms (respiratory infection or coughing issues) at the same time.CML..... i will try another vet or school as you recommend.\u00a0\u00a0I have told my vet on a few occasions that 300-400 is normal under stress,\u00a0\u00a0but he jumped on diabetes and insisted that was Antar's issue.\u00a0\u00a0I DO feel that he drinks & urinates more every time he is sick, but I wonder if the chicken came before the egg....or visa versa.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible that when he is sick or stressed that it makes his sugar rise....and makes him drink & pee more?\u00a0\u00a0Besides medical issues,\u00a0\u00a0he REALLY loves to demand that I turn on the sink. He doesn't seem too interested in his water bowl UNLESS he's sick.Sigh.... I'm so confused.",

    "question": "The short question, without the LONG background story... What can cause a cat's blood sugar to test high 300-400 range, if there his frustosamine levels are normal or low??\u00a0\u00a0He just got over yet \"another\" infection that was fought with an antibiotic shot.\u00a0\u00a0Vet tried putting him on insulin for a few months, but weekly blood sugar was normal every time BEFORE his shot and his fructosamine levels tested very low (we almost killed him.)\u00a0\u00a0Vet insists that infections make blood sugar go down.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly my cat is on/off lethargic and has been drinking more water lately.\u00a0\u00a0Seems like an on/off issue.Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0Vet now wants me to take \"Antar\" to a specialist and get an ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0After several months and thousands of dollars in vet bills, I'd like to get an idea of what could be causing this issue and not just keep tossing money at tests and meds he doesn't need.",
