            "answer": "Total Free T3 is an outdated test and does give an exact level of the Residual T3 in your body. Ask then to do the Free T3 not total. It sounds like you are having both Hyper and Hypo symptoms, make sure your MD is aware that you are having these, also your indication regarding getting shaky indicates a blood sugar issue, I have Hypogycemia, which causes low blood sugar, and in turn causes shaky and light headedness, also Diabetes can cause the same symptom, some of your symptoms could be from blood sugar issues, but you definatly are having mixed thyroid symptoms also. Your MD needs to do more lab work, such as a Complete Blood Count, The3 complete thyroid Panel and maybe a Glucose Intolerance Test to determine blood sugar issues. Best of Luck FTB4",

I am quite upset with my dr as I specifically asked for both T3 and T4 be ran, but he copped out. He didn;t want to even run those other than the TSH.Thanks for your response...I have had every test I can think of so far, to gauge organ functions...I even have elevated iron, which I know can damage pituitary and thyroid glands, so it all makes me wonder about the sources of my symptoms. Many diagnosed with hypothyroid and Hashi's also find out they are high in iron, even if they have been told they are anemic.Very confusing all around...Cheerz",

            "answer": "TSH is a screening test at best.\u00a0\u00a0It is basically otherwise useless unless it shows WAY far to the extremes.There to my knowledge is not such test as \"free total T3\".\u00a0\u00a0I think that is a typo and should be that the \"total T3\" is an outdated test of little value.TSH is only an INDICATOR hormone.\u00a0\u00a0To truly get a better handle on your thyroid test you actually have to test for the two thyroid hormones that your body actually uses.\u00a0\u00a0These are \"FREE T4\" and \"FREE T3\".Free means that the hormone is not attached to a protein. Once a protein attaches itself to the hormone it becomes biologically inactive.Many people have found they need to be WELL up into the range of BOTH of these values.\u00a0\u00a0Being just \"somewhere in the range\" is NOT good enough for most people.\u00a0\u00a0The better target seems to be to have BOTH of the following:1) Free T4 (FT4) to be in the MIDDLE of the range (50%) or slightly higher.AND- that means in addition2) Free T3 (FT3) to be in the UPPER 1/3 of the range (66.7%).Your test show that your FT4 is 39% of the range.\u00a0\u00a0A fair amount below the 50% target.Your T3 was total but as you can see it is towards the bottom end of the range.At the cellular level your body only uses the FREE T3 molecule. Since the TOTAL test counts both the free and attached (useless) T3 and you are towards the bottom end of the TOTAL range, not knowing how many are attached to the protein or not it would stand to reason that you'd likely be towards the low end of the Free T3 range as well. You really need to be tested to know for sure.To test for Hashimotos there are two tests that need to be run.\u00a0\u00a0TPOab and TGab.\u00a0\u00a0These are two different antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0Hashi's is the leading cause of Hypo in the developed world.\u00a0\u00a0And the early stages of it can cause a person to swing from Hypo (low) to Hyper (high) thyroid and symptoms.If test come back elevated for any one of these it would indicate that you have Hashi's.Graves disease is also auto immune and causes hyper (high) thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0The definitive test for this is TSI.\u00a0\u00a0Again an elevated ttest result would show positive for graves.Most of the symptoms you list are consistent with Hypo.\u00a0\u00a0Some symptoms of hypo and hyper cross over.My wife who is also Hypo gets the shakes if not eating enough and also craves carbs.\u00a0\u00a0She has been tested for diabetes and is OK but may be towards the borderline.\u00a0\u00a0Might be due to her weight which also is up due to slow metabolism caused by being Hypo.Insulin resistent patients you are Hypo are also not all that uncommon from what I've read it seems.Understand each person is different and the target FT4 and FT3 listed above is just that, something to shoot for.\u00a0\u00a0But some people feel well being lower or higher than the targets.\u00a0\u00a0The secret is to if starting medications, start small and increase slowly in dosages.The MAIN thing is symptom relief.\u00a0\u00a0Find a Dr who will test BOTH the FT4 and FT3.\u00a0\u00a0If they only go by TSH they will almost assuredly keep you feeling ill.\u00a0\u00a0Or they will continue to tell you that you are \"normal\" because you fall within a reference range.\u00a0\u00a0Understand that many people as stated above need to be WELL up higher than the reference range.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for detailed info. I know that the TSH is a wishy-washy guide at best, however, it is good for them to treat with all three numbers in mind? I have read some Dr. Rind information, and he has a table he uses to diagnose and treat for optimal TSH, FT4 and FT3...http://www.drrind.com/forms/ts_diagrammer.pdfAlso this is diagram is from the article he wrote which is linked here:http://www.drrind.com/therapies/thyroid-scaleHe is very consistent with what all the research is showing about new understandings of how the optimal ranges are sooooo much more sensitive and strict when it comes to effective treatment for hypo and hyperthyroid.Diabetes runs in my family on both sides, my father and my grandfather, on Mom's side, so I need to keep this in mind, as well as liver disease and cancer in both grandparents, and as well as kidney disease, father, and decreased kidney function in myself and brother.I have many symptoms over my lifespan that have never been able to be pinpointed or explained and neve severe enough to force the drs to take anything seriously. I had my last dr get very angry with me for asking about my blood tests that showed high iron...these were the first tests I had had done in many, many years, since I was pregnant with my now 6 year old son! So I don't think I was being unreasonable to have serious concerns based on many of the readings I got. Even my CBC's are borderline high...Anyway, the thyroid puzzle is just another piece to decipher for me, and see if it has any bearing on the way I feel. I just want to crawl into a hole and never wake up, at the moment. But I also have a very ill husband and two small children so I force myself to put my feet on the floor every day and function to some extent.Thanks again...slowly starting to get the idea, and appreciate all the help.",

    "question": "I am going back to the dr today and need some help deciphering my results...I have had so many issues with thyroid symptoms for as long as I can remember...I am 42 female, and am gaining weight, my hair has been falling out for years, I am exhausted, headaches and migraines constantly, have for years tried to find the source of something stuck in my throat, sometimes painful, too many digestive and bowel problems to count, including absess and fistula for 3 years, heart palpitations and shortness of breath, infertility for 13 years (then strangely got pregnant twice), dificulty concentrating and very forgetful for every day tasks or info, pressure behind eyes, crave carbs and get shaky if I don't eat something, insomnia and sleep disturbances, irritable and cranky, depressed feeling...I an't tell you how many times I have been to dr and they ahve always said I fall in the range for TSH...they never allowed me to look further, meaning they never wanted to run the extra tests...so finally I put my foot down iwth new dr and he got me the free t4 BUT instead of free t3 like I asked, he ordered total t3...I think that is not enough???My TSH last month was 1.92 (reference .40 - 5.5) mU/LMy recent Free T4 is 14.1 pmol/l (reference 9. - 22.0) I would like to know how this converts to ng/l???Total T3 1.9 nmol/l (reference 1.2-3.1)I f anyone can help me figure this out I would be thankful...I have to go to dr today and ask for other tests, as I just feel so yucky, but I am scared he won't do it if I am in the ranges. Also my B12 was tested last month and it is 297. I think that is quite low from what I can read anywhere about the optimal levels...again if anyone has some other insights...thank you so much.I feel lost here...",
