            "answer": "We are NOT doctors and can, in no way, offer you any sort of \"diagnosis\" regarding your father. What I can offer you is my OPINION that your fathers medical issues are NOT being dealt with properly......in fact, it sounds like they aren't being dealt with at all.Your fathers high blood pressure, which you say he has known about for 12 YEARS, should have been treated and brought under control long ago. If he IS on medication, it's not working and needs to be reevaluated sooner than later.His diabetes should also be under control after 10 years.Please bear in mind that both of these issues can and do change over time. Medications often have to be increased/decreased/changed or stopped, but his doctor should be watching his numbers closely and dealing with any and all changes aggressively.Cholesterol is yet another condition that can be controlled through medication and if he can't get him numbers into a healthy range through diet and exercise, his doctor needs to discuss putting your father on one of the statins.I am not qualified to address ANY of the results of your fathers ECGS. Those will have to be explained to him by his doctor or a cardiologist.I'm sorry I can't tell you what all this means, but I can in good conscious tell you that your father needs to be evaluated for all these issues as soon as possible...........preferably by a different doctor since the one he has been seeing seems to be ignoring all of your fathers signs and symptoms.I don't want to scare you, but at 52 your father is still young and should not be laying around on the couch with severe leg pain and sleeping all the time. These are both red flags. Please get your father to a doctor as soon as you can and get these issues dealt with.I wish your father a return to good health and hope you will let us know how he is doing.RW",

            "answer": "Very sorry to hear this is going on sir!\u00a0\u00a0I would say, and you don't have to be a doctor to know this part, that your dad has several significant health issues that would be concerning if they were by themselves let alone on top of one another.Is your dad on any medication on any of these issues?\u00a0\u00a0That is really what he should do if he isn't currently.\u00a0\u00a0He is a young man and would hate for his life to be shortened by these health concerns.I'm sure this is very worrisome to you.\u00a0\u00a0I would talk to your dad about his doctor and either see this doctor WITH him or change doctors to one that has a good reputation or even up the ante and take him to a specialist such as a cardiologist.There are medications that treat these conditions as well as lifestyle changes that can help.\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss, exercise and diet are all essential pieces to curing or slowing the progression of these issues.\u00a0\u00a0Now, lifestyle things can be tough and sometimes this takes creativity on the part of family members.\u00a0\u00a0Your mother changing her shopping list and preparing foods in a healthier manner may come from a book that you purchase for her on the subject.\u00a0\u00a0Dad may walk if you ask him to walk with you.\u00a0\u00a0We gave my father in law a gym membership where there are plenty of seniors so that he feels comfortable there.\u00a0\u00a0And again, there ARE medications that can really help with someone's blood pressure, cholesterol, diabetes, etc.So, talk to your dad about seeing his physician with him and getting a game plan together so you have lots of years to enjoy together.\u00a0\u00a0peace",
