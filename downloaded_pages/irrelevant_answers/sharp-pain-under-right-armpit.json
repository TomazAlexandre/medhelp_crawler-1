            "answer": "Greg I too believe it is probably a lymph node or gland filling up.\u00a0\u00a0I agree a run of antibiotics will most likely take care of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0If you can have your doctor check it before it bursts again because you need to ensure it is just something minor.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Pain in the armpit can be due to heat intolerance and due to sweat dermatitis. It is also possible due to peripheral artery disease. Peripheral neuropathies as in diabetes, chemical burns due to any deo or lotions you use, peripheral nerve compression are the other possibilities. Nerve conduction studies and color dopplar should be done. If all this is ruled out then it can be thoracic outlet syndrome. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiThanks for the update!Since the pain is at a level lower than the armpit, it could be shingles without a rash. Antiviral like acyclovir usually helps. The other possibility is a pinched intercostal nerve. Discuss these two possibilities with a doctor.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "A few months ago I was taking a shower and when I was washing under my right arm I experienced an intense pain.\u00a0\u00a0It felt like a needle or hot burst inside me just under the skin and under my right armpit.\u00a0\u00a0After that it would come and go.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed like something was building up over time and then when I press on it something would burst and I would get that pain.\u00a0\u00a0It would then temporally go away and would happen again after awhile.\u00a0\u00a0There is no outward swelling or discoloration.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the Doctor and she felt around took a chest xray, a ekg, but was basically stumped.\u00a0\u00a0After a couple of weeks it went away.\u00a0\u00a0Well yesterday it came back.\u00a0\u00a0To me it feels like a gland filling up and then releasing causing the pain. Would anyone have any suggestions?",
