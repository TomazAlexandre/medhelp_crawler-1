    "question": "I'm at my wits end and, after 20 doctors, no one has been able to diagnose or treat me.I am 53 years old, overweight, and have diabetes II, which is well managed with oral medication (Hemoglobin A1C - 6.0).\u00a0\u00a0I do not smoke, drink, use drugs, or have pets.About 10 months ago, I started feeling lightheaded and dizzy on going from sit to stand.\u00a0\u00a0Within a few weeks, the symptoms quickly progressed to the present point where I have severe pain in my head mostly on the left side and on my scalp, dizziness all the time except for when I'm laying down, fullness and pain in my ears, and tazer-like sensations in my head a few times a day.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms are debilitating.\u00a0\u00a0When I walk, it is as though my feet are not touching the ground.\u00a0\u00a0I feel sick in my stomach all the time and have very little appetite, which has resulted in a 15-pound weight loss (good, but for the wrong reasons).I have had MRI of my head, cervical spine, abdomen and pelvis, all negative.\u00a0\u00a0I had an MRA of my brain - negative. I had a holter monitor, 4 EKGs, carotid doppler, echocardiogram, tilt table test, thallium stress test, CBC, U/A, Chem 21, thyroid function test (TSH and Free T4) and was also tested for Lyme disease and mercury poisoning.\u00a0\u00a0Everything comes up negative.I have seen 6 neurologists, 2 ENT specialists, 4 cardiologists, 3 internal medicine specialists, and been hospitalized 2 times for 3 days each time and once overnight.\u00a0\u00a0Still, no diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I have had several sessions of vestibular physical therapy and 5 acupuncture sessions for head pain.\u00a0\u00a0Still no relief and the P.T. made the pain even worse.\u00a0\u00a0OTC pain killers do not relieve the head pain.\u00a0\u00a03 weeks of Meclizine did not help my dizziness.I am still suffering with no diagnosis and, thus, no treatment.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors have ruled out malignancy, vertigo, migraine, cardiovascular issues, and vascular compromise.\u00a0\u00a0One doctor told me that maybe I need to see a shrink.\u00a0\u00a0He asked if I was depressed.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing depressing me is that no one knows what is wrong with me, including me!Can someone help me, please!\u00a0\u00a0I don't even know which direction to turn for help anymore.\u00a0\u00a0The great hospitals want to know where to direct my call.\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea.\u00a0\u00a0So right now, I am not under a doctor's care because all of the doctors have thrown up their hands.\u00a0\u00a0HELP!",
