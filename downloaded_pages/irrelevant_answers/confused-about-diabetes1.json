            "answer": "Most non-diabetics blood sugar rarely rises above 120 no matter what they eat, so yes, your doctor is right to do an A1C and you might in fact be pre-diabetic. If that turns out to be the case you might want to do some re-thinking of your diet as things like oatmeal and cereal will definitely jack up your blood sugars.Also if the doctor does diagnose you, given your age and if you are in a normal weight range, you might want to request an antibody test to make sure you are in fact type 2 and not LADA/1.5",

            "answer": "Zoelula provided a good answer.You need your own insulin monitor and should not be using someone elses. Almost all of them have computer memories which are downoaled when you go to your physician for prescription renewal and medication adjustment. The computer will not be able to distinguish between your readings and the person to whom the meter was issued. These meters are very inexpensive with rebates (they make money on the test tabs).The answers you seek are best provided by a diabetes screening clinic, which have excellent nurses and people who will evaluate you. These clinics are (in my experience) really good. Taking random blood readings after eating random foods does not provide much information.",

            "answer": "Pre-diabetes is A1C from 5.7 to 6.4 and 6.5 and above is diabetes, so yes, you would be categorized pre-diabetes.Caregiver is correct that you need to learn to test with a purpose, to learn what foods allow your blood sugar to stay under 140 two hours after eating (even better is under 120). It sounds like you have a good doctor; some don't take pre-diabetes seriously at all. It also sounds like you have started doing the things you need to do to prevent your diabetes from progressing-change in diet, exercise and weight loss. Keep up the good work!",

It used to be people didn't get tested and didn't get diagnosed until they had significant symptoms, by which point a lot of damage may have already occured. I believe diagnosing pre-diabetes is very positive as it allows people to make changes before they have progressed to the point where complications set in.",

    "question": "I have been worrying since I went to the doctors the other day.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr. checked my blood sugar in january and it was fine.\u00a0\u00a0He decided to test it again because I got a fungal rash which he says can be indicative of high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0The test came back a 143 and I had eaten about hour to hour and half before the test.\u00a0\u00a0He says it could be pre-diabetes and has ordered an a1c that hasn't come back yet.My dad has type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 35 year old male and my dad was diabetic by age 33 or so.I have been using his monitor to check my sugar levels since I heard this.\u00a0\u00a0I used to check it from time to time and it was always within the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0I have checked my fasting blood sugar the last 3 mornings and they were 90, 88, 90 which I know is in the normal range.What is confusing me is two evenings in a row I have had oatmeal and a a bowl of Total cereal and 45 minutes later my sugar is 135-145.\u00a0\u00a0After about 2 hours they are in the 120's and after 3 hours they are within the normal range.I'm not sure if my sugars are rising too high after I eat or if that is normal.\u00a0\u00a0Everywhere I read it seems to say something different.Thanks for any advice.",
