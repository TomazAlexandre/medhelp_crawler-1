            "answer": "with my health plan they will not do elective inductions at all, and wont induce till baby is at -least- 1 week late (41 weeks.) its not a good idea to induce early if there's no medical reason .. if your body isnt ready, the pitocin/etc may not work and you may be headed for a c-section.",

            "answer": "Big babies are good...not bad.\u00a0\u00a0Your dr. doesn't have 100% accuracy on the size of your baby.\u00a0\u00a0I call it the 'guesstimate'...it is a guess based on fundal height.\u00a0\u00a0They can, and more often are about a pound off.\u00a0\u00a0A pound is A LOT when something only weighs 7.I agree with the above.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody WANTS to do the full 40 weeks, but that is part of the deal.\u00a0\u00a0We all get tired of being pregnant....join the club. To naturally induce labor, have intercourse and remain active.\u00a0\u00a0The more pressure that is put on the cervix will help facilitate labor.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, semen has a natural way of softening the cervix when it is 'ready'.\u00a0\u00a0You may do all these, and still not go into labor, because your not ready.The last thing you want is an induced labor that doesn't take, because your body wasn't ready. You don't just get to walk out of the hospital at the point, you will be thrown into surgery for an emergency c-section. It isn't worth 2 weeks of not being pregnant.My dr. wouldn't consider induction until I went 7 days past my due date.\u00a0\u00a0I was induced 2X's, because my water was leaking.\u00a0\u00a0The first was 4 days early, the second was 2 weeks early.\u00a0\u00a0My body had already made its own progression prior to induction.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck with your delivery!",

My doctor has also said he expects a big baby from me due to gestatiional diabetes and if so then he would go ahead and do a c-section around 36 or 37 wks, but i'm not 36.2 wks and they scheduled an u/s for the 22nd for babies weight, but this will be the longest weight. i'll already be 38 wks by then!!!!!!!!!!!!! i can't take it!",

That is considered full term so they let labor continue. He was delivered by emergency c-section and almost died.Please don't be so eager to rush things.",
