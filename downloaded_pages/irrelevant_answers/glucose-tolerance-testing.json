I am not really looking forward to it because it is a lot of sugar and I worry about how much is going into the baby. But apparently it is necessary. I just don't like too many outside interferences, but I will be doing it Thursday.I'm actually curious to hear from the other girls who had it done to help ease my mind :)",

            "answer": "I got mine a couple weeks ago. it was like drinking flat sprite. I got a small sugar rush then an hour later had to get my blood drawn. Every thing came out fine. I don't think there was any in my urine, if there was they didn't tell me. It was my understanding that everyone gets the test done around 26 weeks. Good luck to you ladies on your tests.",

            "answer": "I had my one hour april first and failed it with a level of 176. I had the orange drink cold and it wasnt to bad but ended up throwing up and feeling crappy the rest of the day. i didnt throw up till about 3 hours after the test though. I had to do the 3 hour this past monday had to drink the fruit punch hot and I wouldnt reccommend that flavor. then they put me in a exam room and i had to have my blood drawn every hour for three hours. I felt really queasy and jittery the whole time and half a hour before my last blood draw i threw it all up. They did a finger ***** as i was throwing up to make sure my sugar wasnt\u00a0\u00a0to low and it was 217 way to high. but I felt pretty crappy after that test to and the docotr called me yesterday and it shows I have gesgational diabetes not sure what all that means but i go the 15th to meet with the nurse and discuss it. I know ill have to folow a diet and do finger suger checks daily and non stress test and definatly wont go past 40 weeks so we should see. Im scared and nervous but I guess this is why they do the test we had no idea i had geagational diabetes till the test",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for sharing. I am worried about taking the test at the end of this month. I have to take the hour test on April 29 to determin if I have gesgational diabetes also. I guess if I fail the first one, I have to move on to the 3 hour test. I am nervous about the whole thing too but I believe it can be controlled with a proper diet and exercise. Best of luck and thanks again:-)",
