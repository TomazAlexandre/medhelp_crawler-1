            "answer": "Hello,Ichthyosis is a skin disorder causing dry, scaly skin. It generally begins in childhood and can often be associated with atopic dermatitis, allergies etc. But we need to confirm what your wife is allergic to. She may be allergic to dust mites or pollen etc also. Regarding the symptom of constant urge to pee, primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are prostatitis(inflammation of the prostate gland),interstitial cystitis,overactive bladder syndrome, stroke and other neurological diseases, STD\u2019s, urinary incontinence,bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .Please consult a urologist in that case.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I've read that overgrowth of Candida may cause Ichthyosis. Well, I seem to have both. Ichthyosis should not be contagious, but I think that my wife has gotten this Candida-type from me (over 20 years together). Can she also be allergic to me? Her nose starts running when she comes home - and we don't have any mold problems in the house. Is constant urge to pee also a symptom of Ichthyosis?",
