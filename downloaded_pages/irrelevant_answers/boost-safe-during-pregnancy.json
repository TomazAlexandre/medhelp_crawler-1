            "answer": "Ensure is basically just a high calorie drink that helps people gain weight and has vitamins in so it can be used as a sole source of nutrition in people that cant/wont eat!! We use it alot in our nursing home and its perfectly safe, in the UK the doc would prescribe it so u can get it free (prescriptions are free during pregnancy). It might just help u keep ur calorie count up while ur havin morning sickness.... tho they are very sweet and sickly, some are milkshake and some r like syrup, so i would drink them a bit at a time x",

            "answer": "That's a good question.. Makes me think though, I get how the extra calories would be helpful,but what about the extra vitamins in them? If you're already taking a prenatal vitamin and then get more vitamins from the drink couldn't that not be good for you.. I do know if you get too much of certain vitamins it can make you pretty sick..",
