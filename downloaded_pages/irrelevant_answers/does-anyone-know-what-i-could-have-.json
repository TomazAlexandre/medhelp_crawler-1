My parents do not believe me at this point and think it's all in my head. I was thinking it could either be a gluten sensitive allergy..or maybe a yeast infection.",

    "question": "In late 2012, I awoke with vigorous itching in my rectum. It continued since then and during the day also. Earlier that year I went to Rome, London and Greece. I also started working at a childcare center right before I got the itching. Late 2013 the symptoms got worse. I got anxiety, depression and mood swings. And no matter how much I ate, I was still starving and constantly craving sweets. I finally went to the gastrologist, positive it was parasites. He made me do the parasite stool test and it came back saying I didn't have any parasites. Although I was very persistent to the gastrologist, so he gave me two pills to get rid of the parasites. This week, the itching came back. Full force I might add. And I have gotten some excema rashes all over my arms.(This may not pertain but I had eaten a lot of sweets and just had some sugar cookies) I am having awful insomnia because I can't stop itching at night.\u00a0\u00a0I am just so tired of this. Does anyone know what it could be?",
