            "answer": "Hi! I quickly googled it for you and here's the first I saw: http://www.morningsicknesshelp.com/morningsicknesscauses.htmlHormones... what can you do about it... I had almost no morningsickness the first trimester, but now at 23 weeks... it's way worse. And the only thing that works for me is eating ;-) If I don't get gestational diabetes this time (and put on a diet) I'll end up gaining more weight than with my twins ;-)",

            "answer": "Hi everyone. I wonder if anyone has some advice for my situation? I am around 5 wks pregnant, and have had sore breasts since ovulation, cramping for the last 2 weeks, and queasiness on & off for 2 weeks. My doctor says all of these symptoms are normal in pregnancy & nothing to worry about, unless I see bleeding, which I have not. However, I am noticing the queasiness is lessening, and my breasts are not as tender as they were. The cramping seems to be a little less too. Does this mean something bad? Is it normal for symptoms to come & go this early on? I thought as the HcG levels increase in the 1st trimester, your symptoms increase too. Why are my symptoms waning now? I am worried. Any advice would be appreciated, thanks!",
