            "answer": "my dad was diabetic on insulin shots for a long time and I know from him that when he started swetting, this means his sugar went low and he needed to take some sweets to balance the system. I don't know if this is the case with your mom, but once she starts swetting try to test for blood sugar and see if it is normal. I don't want to scare you, but if it is too low give her a candy, because low sugar is really dangerous. It may lead to blindness. I hope I was helpful. Good luck!",
