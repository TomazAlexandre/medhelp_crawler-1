            "answer": "Everyone agrees that normal 8-10 hr fasting (prandial) glucose ranges are 70-99 mg/dl. Then we have 2-4 hours after meal (postprandial) which is 140-145 mg/dl. This is what you father should aiming for.BUT, and I say but because with your pregnancy it has a different outcome. An Endocrinologist (diabetes specialist) should be seen to get an expert opinion.",

            "answer": "\"I was curious as to how normal type II is managed\"Here are some tips to help control and lower your glucose:1.\tCut out sugar and processed foods. It\u2019s the most important and hardest thing to do. Eat more fruits and veggies instead. Skip desert, period. Don\u2019t be tempted to munch on bad foods between meals.2.\tEat a better breakfast. Your metabolism is faster in the morning than it is later in the day. Skip the man made dry cereals for they are loaded with sugar. Instead of doughnuts, eat foods high in fiber, protein and good fats, like a veggie omelet, or oatmeal with \u00bc tsp cinnamon and handful of blueberries for the antioxidant compounds.3.\tLearn to love your veggies. Although it\u2019s contrary to many American meals, eat a main course of veggies with a small side of meat to provide the right nutritional balance.4.\tMonitor the types of foods you eat by keeping a log.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid those foods that raise your glucose.Moderate exercise:1.\tGo for a walk after eating to help burn off excess glucose.2.\tDo some sort of moderate exercise daily or at least 3-5 times a week.Weight:1.\tYou\u2019d be surprised how much lower your glucose will be if you shed those EXTRA pounds.It\u2019s all up to your father to start practicing a better lifestyle control to improve and maintain good health. It may be difficult for him to see this if he's at the age of being stubborn and not wanting change in his life. Then we can only wish him the the best and try to make his life as comfortable as possible.",

            "answer": "Hi,I had GD when I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I gave birth 2 1/2 months ago.Usual treatment is insulin to control blood sugar during pregnancy, not oral meds, but guess it does vary between doctors.The target fasting bs in pregnancy is < 95 mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0Target 2 hours after eating is < 120 mg/dL.\u00a0\u00a0This is more strict than you use for non-pregnant people with diabetes.My fasting BS now is 90 - 100 mg/dL which my dr is happy with.\u00a0\u00a0However he will put me on insulin again to bring it down when I am trying to get pregnant again.All the diet & lifestyle information above is great.

    "question": "I currently have Gestational diabetes, and my father has diabetes type II. I check my sugar 2 hrs after every meal and my fasting in the morning. I take glyburide 5mg twice a day, which i think needs to be adjusted as my sugars bottoms out usually atleast twice a day. But my fasting sugar is always higher than my doctor would like. His (my doctor) expectations are under 90 for fasting and under 120 for my 2hrs.I guess my question is this.... is this common practice for people with diabetes? Are those numbers that endocrinologist usually use for ppl with type II? My father says he checks his sugar before he eats and uses those results. What are the levels that doctors hope to achieve with people with type II?",
