            "answer": "I have the symptoms all the time. I've had many blood tests and everything comes back fine. I wonder if it's more something to do with the brain. Low blood sugar would show in a blood test wouldn't it? :)",

            "answer": "I know this sounds way out of left field.... but have you been tested for liver ailments. The reason I ask is because I was first diagnosed with depression when really I had Hep C. Liver function tests can come back normal sometimes when the liver has been damaged. I was fatigue, achy, vomiting, i also swelled though (ascites and edema) Not to scare you, but it is something worth looking into. (probably not though... I was born with Hep C) just a suggestion.",

            "answer": "I've just thought of some more symptoms. I have trouble putting weight on. I can eat a lot but I remain very skinny and I look sick the majority of the time. I also get anemic but that's under control at the moment. All I want to do is sleep all the time but when it comes to bed time, I can't sleep. I sometimes lie there for hours wide awake. I'm often irritable too.",

            "answer": "Well, only if they did specific test to LOOK for low blood sugar. When diagnosing Diabetes and Hypoglycemia you have to have a special test done.Do you take a multi vitamin on a regular basis? If not, maybe you could have a vitamin deficiency of some sort?",

            "answer": "You're welcome. I agree, 4 years of having a dr. almost ignore you even when you know you feel ill is not something that should be taken lightly. At least not in my opinion. Change doctors. Very easy to do.Every time I read this site and all of the people who are feeling ill, I say a mass prayer for everyone. I will add you to that prayer. I hope you can figure out whats causing you to feel sick. I know what its like.I had a rare blood disorder go undiagnosed AND misdiagnosed for Lord only knows how long. I felt as if I was dying. Come to find out, I had a disorder called PCV (Polycythemia Vera).",

Who wouldn't be when no body will listen to you!?Thank you for adding me to your mass prayer. That's something to warm the heart.I'm sorry about your disorder. It must have been a relief to finally have it diagnosed. I hope it doesn't cause too many problems for you.I used to take multi vitamins on a regular basis but I felt they didn't help at all. I then stopped taking them because a study said that taking them regularly makes you 35% more likely to develop breast cancer. It could be wrong but I'd rather not take the risk at this point. I was slightly low on B12 so I got a course of B12 injections. I don't think it has helped though.I had a test for diabetes about 10 years ago and it came out negative. I could mention that to my doctor too. The options are endless. I get rather annoyed when he keeps saying it's depression.",

            "answer": "The disorder I had went away/I was healed. It wasnt something to take lightly, as it isnt the kind of disorder to just go away. It could have caused me to develop Leukemia and all sorts of other problems. I see a Hematologist/Oncologist on a regular basis now to have my blood checked for problems.It is amazing the side effects that stress can cause someone. Stress can literally kill you. The symptoms you mention do sound similar to those of stress, but you say you're enjoying life. Unfortunately stress can be something that effects us subconsciously as well. We don't necessarily have to\u00a0\u00a0be aware of its presence.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 20 year old female and I've been having symptoms for 4 years now. They are progressively getting worse as time goes on so it's very concerning for me. My symptoms include, difficulty concentrating, poor judgment, blurry vision, derealisation, depersonalisation, confusion, anxiety, heavy limbs, loss of co-ordination, very bad memory, muscle/joint aches, tummy ache, fatigue etc. And the list goes on. My doctor diagnosed me with depression but I don't think that is the problem. I am happy with my life etc. I just want to know what is causing all this because I feel like I'm losing functionality. My senses are becoming impaired - slow reactions, losing taste, can't feel warmth/cold as I should, sense of smell is weak etc...",
