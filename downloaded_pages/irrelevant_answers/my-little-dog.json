            "answer": "Little Lily needs to see the vet. I can feel how much you love her.If she's throwing up white foam, that means she isn't throwing up her food! That's a good thing. But her weight loss needs investigating, and something like an anti-nausea drug might help her.Does she throw up when she has an empty stomach? Some dogs do. I had a Jack Russell once who used to go outside, eat grass, throw up foam and grass, as easily as if he was cleaning his toe-nails....then come in and ask for his dinner!The vet never figured out why he did it. And that was when he was 7 or 8. (He lived healthily to over 14) I found that feeding him smaller quantities more frequently helped.",

            "answer": "Sorry....it posted before I could add this. Please do take her to the vet and ask for a complete blood work-up. Check diabetes, and kidney & liver function. Never mind how old she is. So long as she has decent quality of life she is entitled to get very old indeed if she wants to.",
