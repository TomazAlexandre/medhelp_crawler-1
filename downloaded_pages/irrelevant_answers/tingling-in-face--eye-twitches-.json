            "answer": "Hi plentyofkids.this could be a duel problem.Are you taking any medications at the moment? Some, can cause an all over the body itch.As for the eye problem and the numbness in and around your face, it could be migraine.I get an \"aura\" a warning by my eyes, lip, nose and chin going numb prior to the headache.Or, sometimes I just get the numbness-no headache but it is still a migraine.As you have mentioned stress, then we can assume it is a factor. If it is causing the migraines, I am not sure but a vist to your GP would be a good idea. Good luck, Cath278",

I was wondering if this could all be related to eachother. I also have been under a lot of stress but don't want to just assume it is that. Thanks",
