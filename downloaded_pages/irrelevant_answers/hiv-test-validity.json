    "question": "Would a 12 week Elisa and a 16 week UniGold Rapid test still be considered conclusive if you found out a month later that your latest WBC came up low during a routine physical? A follow-up test showed that my WBC returned to normal a few weeks later. I see on the internet that immunocompromised people can take longer to seroconvert, but I am not sure if I would be in that category. I never used drugs and I'm not on chemo. Nor do I have diabetes or any other diagnosed issue.",
