            "answer": "Your LVEF is in the heart failure range (below 29%) and it is not unusual to feel fine.\u00a0\u00a0It is estimated about 26% individuals in the heart disorder population do not know they have a heart problem\u00a0\u00a0(heart failure).\u00a0\u00a0They perform their regular tasks without symptoms.A dilated LV will decrease the EF and can cause mitral valve regurgitation (I'm not sure w3ant you mean by swelling).I am assuming your dilated LV is due to an overworked heart.\u00a0\u00a0The medication I took and take is a beta blocker, ACE inhibitor, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The medication will dilate vessels and the heart will not have a high resistance to pump against, and the beta blocker/ACE inhibitor will reduce heart rate as well.\u00a0\u00a0It took about a year for me to go from an EF 13-29% and heart size returned to normal.A dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) can have other causes, and it is difficult to assess without knowing the underlying reason.\u00a0\u00a0I can only relate my experience.",
