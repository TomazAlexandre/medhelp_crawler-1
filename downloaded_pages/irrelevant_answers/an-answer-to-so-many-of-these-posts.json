    "question": "I think I have your answer!\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0But so very, very\u00a0\u00a0many of these symptoms are caused by adrenal gland disorders and pituitary gland disorders.\u00a0\u00a0See an endocrinologist or a rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0You are NOT crazy, your body is trying to tell you something!Adrenal glands produce three types of steroidal hormones.\u00a0\u00a0If you have too much or too little of any of these hormones you can an array of symptoms that come and go.\u00a0\u00a0Those glands also control your sodium and potassium levels.\u00a0\u00a0Hyper or hypo active adrenal glands can cause tingling, chest pain, abdominal pain, sweating, lightheadedness; symptoms mirroring diabetes, blood pressure fluctuations, tendency to gain or lose weight; lack of energy; difficulty concentrating; poor memory; chronically high stress levels; mild depression; dry and thin skin; unexplained hair loss; heart palpitations; dyspepsia; constipation; hypoglycemia (low blood sugar); food allergies, high frequency of the flu or infections, lightheadedness upon standing, diabetes, unwanted facial or body hair, sexual dysfunction, weakness, nausea, paleness, altered consciousness, seizures, and on and on.Simple to diagnose (go to an endocrinologist) and simple to treat IF you go to a doctor with experience with these issues.\u00a0\u00a0My advice to anyone who has weird symptoms and no diagnosis is to go see an endocrinologist!Hope this helps!\u00a0\u00a0Could someone clean this up and repost it to other discussions where people might benefit?\u00a0\u00a0Thx!",
