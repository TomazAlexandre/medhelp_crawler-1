            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry for your son's diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I know exactly what you're going through, though, being the parent of a child with diabetes myself.\u00a0\u00a0I understand your concerns about getting to know the behaviors and symptoms before you can feel that you can explain them to someone else.\u00a0\u00a0We approached the situation as trying to learn together.\u00a0\u00a0There would come a point when we would have to trust others to care for our daughter when we weren't there, and early on that scared the heck out of us, because we didn't know what we were doing ourselves.Our daughter went back to school (and then day care) the day after diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0We spent a lot of time with our school nurse, with her teachers, and with day care, and we told them with everything that we knew at that point, and we were open with saying that we were going to learn together.\u00a0\u00a0That they are willing to work with you is encouraging, there are some day cares that refuse to.\u00a0\u00a0They are used to seeing your son's behaviors through the day, so they should be able to recognize the symptoms just as easily as you.\u00a0\u00a0They will need to learn the symptoms sooner or later, showing you trust them and are willing to learn with them, will do a lot to make a tough situation better.\u00a0\u00a0It's a hard thing to do at this point, but I'd suggest to let day care learn at the same time you are.\u00a0\u00a0We worked through the menus and portions to figure out the carb counts, we talked about what she could have and shouldn't have any more, and things like that.\u00a0\u00a0Along the way we learned about how exercise affects her blood sugar scores, about exactly which symptoms she exhibits when she's low, all sorts of things.\u00a0\u00a0Call and check up on them a lot, but having that support is a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0Having as much support is a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know where you live, but I'd also suggest joining a JDRF support group in your area.\u00a0\u00a0From JDRF's main web, at the bottom, you can search for a local chapter.\u00a0\u00a0(http://www.jdrf.org)\u00a0\u00a0There is also a bunch of other information and resources there which are really useful.\u00a0\u00a0Our support group has been a wonderful resource for us, and we've made some very good friends from that group.I think the FMLA does cover diabetes care, as it states as a reason to take it:\u00a0\u00a0'To care for an immediate family member (spouse, child, parent) who has a serious health condition'.Please let us know what else we can do to help.",

            "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear about your son...my son as been diagnosed 3 months ago...It's been challenging but it does get alot easier and every time you take his blood sugar level and you're right on target, it's like little victories...I'm happy to hear that your son is taking his tests and insulin well...My son is the same...I find that these children are amazing...It's almost like they know that their lives depend on it...I'm very proud of him and I'm sure you are too...I read alot...everything and anything I can get my hands on...I get it most of the time and sometimes I just can't figure it out. I guess that's part of the learning process... Best of luck to you and your family",

    "question": "My son has been dianosed with Type one diabetes one week ago.\u00a0\u00a0Right now i am back at work and my son is in daycare. The daycare is trying to work with us.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering with him being so young should i take FMLA(and is this condition covered under FMLA) for some time just to get more familiar with his behaviors, symptoms, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He is surprisingly wonderful with taking glucose tests and even the novopen shots.This is all very new to us and we were shocked.\u00a0\u00a0We took him to the Dr. thinking he had a bladder infection only to find out he was near to having been in diabetic coma.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr.s said we are amazingly in tune with our son to have caught it early.Thank You",
