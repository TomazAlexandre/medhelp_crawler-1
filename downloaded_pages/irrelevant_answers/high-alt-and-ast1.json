Other drugs, including some oral diabetes meds can increase liver enzymes. As Trinity mentioned, yours are significantly elevated; you\u2019ve hopped the up somehow\u2026It\u2019s best to refrain from future alcohol use; at least until this has been resolved\u2026 viral hepatitis and booze aren\u2019t good bedfellows.Take care, and good luck\u2014Bill",

However, while these are suggestive of viral hepatitis, they aren\u2019t necessarily predictive of it.Do you administer injections, or are you subject to other biohazards?Good luck\u2014Bill",

I have abused alchol for about 10 yrs, pretty evey zand wonder if they would ave tested for hep b and c as well. Do they automatically do that or will they when I go back in two wks to test again?",
