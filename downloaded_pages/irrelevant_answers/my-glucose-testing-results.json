            "answer": "yeah deep down i know youre right that i shouldnt worry until i get the 3 hrs done,but for me thats hard..im naturally anxious,so i worry about every little thing..as i said,already worried about the cyst,and i just dont want him to have any other complications..but me worrying and stressing isnt helping him either,so guess i gotta just wait and see.. glad all yours worked out!",

    "question": "Had my 1 hour glucose test earlier this week,and OB called me back today.The cutoff number for what they consider safe level is 130.Well mine is 163.So needless to say they want me to come in Monday to do the 3 hour test.I have always been considered\"borderline\"diabetic to begin with,and several family members have diabetes,so Im not surprised.Also working against me is my weight.Before pregnancy I was extremely overweight(still am,and thankfully have only gained 10 lbs throughout these 7months so far),so that was one of the reasons I didnt ovulate and didnt get pregnant for many years.Well the ovulation worked itself out on its own,but the weight is obviously still creating other problems.I know some women who arent overweight get gestational diabetes and baby ends up okay,but due to another prob the baby has(an abdominal cyst that they are unsure of what it is yet until next perinatal ultrasound),my nerves are working overtime.Hopefully I pass the 3 hr test,and if not,hopefully it will be something they can control so me and most importantly the baby,will be ok..Anyone else have experience with gestational diabetes or high blood sugar probs?",
