            "answer": "Beta blockers, statins and aspirin are the primary medications used to treat these both symptomatic and asymptomatic blockages.\u00a0\u00a0You never want them to break off because clots tend to form in that location causing a complete blockage and a large heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0The aspririn helps with the clots, the statins decrease or hold the prgression of these bockages and the beta blockers decrease the likelihood of them breaking off.\u00a0\u00a0If the medications don't help with your symptoms, than the next step is placing stents to reopen the flow.\u00a0\u00a0Surgery is reserved for the very severe cases where stents can't be easily placed or in patients who have abnormal heart function or diabetes.",

    "question": "When a person (white male, 60, non-smoker, normal weight) is diagnosed with a 70-80% blockage in one artery, what is the usual protocol after this discovery? Surgery, additional testing, medication, life style changes, anything else? I read, I think on WebMD, that there is a danger of the blockage breaking off and clogging the entire artery? How common is this and is there anything that be done to prevent it from happening? Originally this sounded like a good thing because the breakage will reduce the size of the blockage but then it sounds dangerous. Thanks for your input.R.T.",
