            "answer": "Hello Tying2Help,I'm so sorry it has taken a few days for you get an answer to your questions.\u00a0\u00a0We're all volunteers here, and sometimes life gets in the way of our volunteer hours.\u00a0\u00a0We are also not physicians, so do make sure the physician of your \"female family member\" hears about the situation and any suggestions you take from the Internet.After a severe low blood sugar episode, we are at risk for additional low blood sugars since it takes a while for system to get back into balance.\u00a0\u00a0Ask the physician about a Continuous Glucose Monitor that can help IN ADDITION to regular finger-stick tests.\u00a0\u00a0If you \"Google\" that phrase, you'll be able to read the products currently approved by the FDA & available in the US.Also, it is NOT usual that our insulin requirements change over time.\u00a0\u00a0It would be a good idea for your family member to meet with a Certified Diabetes Educator and her endocrinologist to be sure she's taking the right doses and that her techniques for correction are up to date.If forgetfullness is at all an issue, perhaps she can get into the habit of writing down all insulin doses.\u00a0\u00a0Severe lows will occur, of course, if we take a needed dose insulin twice (or more!) times because we forget what we've done.I hope this helps a bit, and again, I apologize for the delay.",

New breakthroughs are found every day; I hope one comes soon for your family, mine, and others that suffer with this erratic, dibilitating disease.",

    "question": "A female family member, age late 60s early 70s, has had diabetes for over 20 years.\u00a0\u00a0It was controlled with pills, diet and exercise until several years ago, when insulin injections were started.\u00a0\u00a0Within the past 2 or 3 years, she began have having mild seizures, usually preceeded by a sign, such as tingling, and she would know to medicate.\u00a0\u00a0Within the past year or so, she has had more dramatic seizures with no warning - sometimes waking her husband in the middle of the night thrashing; or wandering in a trance-like state; usually an ambulence must be dispatched to help him.\u00a0\u00a0The episodes are now occurring several times a week.\u00a0\u00a0She went to a specialist, but apparently was told there is not much that can be done about this type of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Is this correct?\u00a0\u00a0She is in otherwise excellent health; is fanatical about diet and exercise, yet it gets worse and worse and we are desperately worried.\u00a0\u00a0She can no longer drive due to the sporadic nature of the disease.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything that can be done to help regulate this, before she does serious damage to other organs or through falling?\u00a0\u00a0Also, we are frightened by the amount of time that lapses before medical help arrives - I'm sure any amount of time with blood levels severely out of whack is not good . . . but at what point will there be permanent damage?\u00a0\u00a0Usually help arrives within 15-20 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice and/or information will be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
