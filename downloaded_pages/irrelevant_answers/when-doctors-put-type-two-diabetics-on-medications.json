            "answer": "First off, congrats on keeping the excess poundage off. However, I think you know your erratic eating behavior is leading you towards being a full blown type 2 diabetic. Eating a slice of pizza [not 2 or 3 from a large] and a couple handfuls of plain slightly salted popcorn is tolerable. Anymore the carbs in these foods will jack up your glucose levels as you attested to in your post as well mess with your body weight. Aside from avoiding sugary foods avoid eating white foods and foods made with white flour; potatoes, white rice, white breads, crackers, pretzels and so on. Also avoid high carbohydrate foods. Carbs is equivalent to refined sugar. Low carbs means low glucose levels and low body weight.\"What levels do most doctors look at when determining to put their patients on medications?\"This depends on your doctor. Doctors will tell you tight control of your glucose levels can prevent or slow the progress of many complications of diabetes. Tight control means getting as close to a normal [non-diabetic] glucose level as you safely can. Ideally, this means levels between 60/70 to 99 mg/dl before meals [some say as high as 130 mg/dl], and less than 141 mg/dl two hours after a meal [some say as high as 181 mg/dl], an optimum postprandial level of 126 mg/dl. Your last A1c of 6.1% equates to 128 mg/dl, diabetes. An A1C level less than 5% [some go as high as 7%] is ideal.\"I was dxed via the O.G.T.T. going on 11 years ago\"Test results only matter with your current present day health state. You cannot use or go by 11 year old test results, they're useless. Good luck",

That seems kind of low?I got my blood work done and will be seeing the doctor on Thursday, so will discuss the results and whether or not I should be on meds.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor suggested I think about being on meds perhaps 5 years ago, but my a1c's were in the 5's and fastings around 97, so we agreed to wait.\u00a0\u00a0I was afraid of the long-term effects of being on meds if it wasn't absolutely necesary yet.Thanks for replying.---Debbie",

            "answer": "\"You don't think I'm diabetic with my levels after meals around 200 sometimes?\"The definition of 'sometimes' is speculative and can\u00a0\u00a0be interpreted in many ways - once a day, three times a day, once a week, once a month and so on. Your last blood work, whatever they were, will help the doctor make a determination; normal, prediabetes, or diabetes. It is just not a good idea to have levels of >200 mg/dl postprandial. Continued levels this high will kill off your beta cells, the cells which produce insulin in your pancreas.\"I wonder how many carbs are in a personal pan pizza (Pizza Hut---pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives)--it is a small pizza?\"Nutritional values for all pizza's are listed on the Pizza Hut web site. Instead of eating an whole pizza, eat 1/4th with other foods - vegies, poultry, fish etc.Good luck with dr's appointment.",

            "answer": "Hi,A1C below 5 is actually normal and what all of us (diabetic or not) should ideally be targetting.If your blood sugar is high (even spiking high) it will damage your pancreas and make your diabetes worse.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore it is important to manage blood sugar early and agressively to get it down to levels as close to normal as possible.If you do this, even though you pancreas may not be at full capacity, it will be able to keep working effectively.Metformin is usually the first line drug for anyone with type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It appears to be very safe and effective in long term studies.\u00a0\u00a0Do not be scared of appropriately using meds. It could save you lots of problem in the long run.think of it as putting out the fire while it is small and before it has spread, rather than trying to put out a bush or wild fire.Diabetes managed (and I do beleive you are diabetic from your numbers) well can avoid complications and problems long term.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes unmanaged is just plain scarey (and painful and poor quality of life, etc).If you are into reading, i can recommend \"diabetes solutions\" by Dr. Richard Bernstein. (You can google it and it is easy to find on Amazon) as the best resourse I personally have found for managing diabetes.",

            "answer": "Thanks again, Sally.Below 5\u00a0\u00a0would be \"normal?\"\u00a0\u00a0Like I asked before, I'd think that would be kind of low?\u00a0\u00a0The labs report 6% as \"normal,\" but I know less than 6% is better for us.I think I've had too many spikes along the way.\u00a0\u00a0I've heard too many times, well, if it goes up high, as long as it goes back under 140 at two hours, you're doing ok.I like your fire analogy!\u00a0\u00a0And I know, if my levels warrant the meds, I'll go along with it.\u00a0\u00a0Especially since I've read or heard of stories of people who had more or less normal levels, weren't on meds, then kind of went to their old habits, and ended up with heart attacks. Scarey!In fact, my aunt was on insulin with type two diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Kind of like me, she was on diet/exercise for 10 years,\u00a0\u00a0but then she had to have a hysterectomy and her glucose went up and was put on insulin soon afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0Sadly, she died of a heart attack at 65.Then her daughter, my cousin (who was never over-weight, by the way) began to have some problems with her glucose levels in her 40's.\u00a0\u00a0Her doctor was \"watching it.\"\u00a0\u00a0She had a heart attack at 44, then she was put on Glucophage sometime later, and\u00a0\u00a0unfortunately, 3 or 5 months after starting the meds, she had her second heart attack and died at 46 years of age.This should help me get out of denial.\u00a0\u00a0But it's easy to tell oneself \"it won't happen to me.\"I'll have to check out that book \"Diabetes Solution.\"\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for suggesting it.\u00a0\u00a0I did read Gretchen Becker's book \"Diabetes, the First Year.\"\u00a0\u00a0That is a really good book, too.\u00a0\u00a0I've read a few other books and have been looking around the internet for information, too.\u00a0\u00a0I prefer the books, since I can read them at my leisure and make notes here and there and go back and read it again later, if I want to.Thank you again for writing.\u00a0\u00a0I will see what my appointment on Thursday brings.\u00a0\u00a0I am apprehensive about it, because I have a feeling things are the worst they've been so far.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm pretty sure if the doctor suggests the meds, I'm ready to take them, then also get more serious about controlling it.Bye for now.---Debbie",
