            "answer": "Hey, ask your doctor about taking metformin during the first three months of pregnancy. It is usually prescribed to treat people with diabetes or kidney problems, but i believe that It's primary function Is to control the level of glucose, which your body excretes, into your system - this can often be a problem for PCOS sufferers.\u00a0\u00a0High levels of glucose can affect the development of a baby in the womb.\u00a0\u00a0This method of treatment was successful for a friend, but I am not a doctor and their may have been other contributing factors. Good luck! :)",

    "question": "Hi! I am a 32 years old and I have some many questions.\u00a0\u00a0I've had a total of 4 miscarriages throughout the years and every pregnancy ended at about week 6-14.\u00a0\u00a0The first couple of times I got pregnant, I was on Clomid.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I was prescribed Progesterone, to help support the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0It would help my levels increase for a while, and then at or around the 12th week I would start bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0Then last year I got pregnant, but the only thing I had taken around that time was an antibiotic.\u00a0\u00a0Cannot remember what antibiotic it was, but I'm thinking it was Amoxicillin.\u00a0\u00a0I've only had 1-DNC and the Dr's told me after the other miscarriages, that they completed on their own.\u00a0\u00a0At the age of 5, I did have a surgery to take care of my Umbilical Hernia.\u00a0\u00a0Let me not forget to mention, I have been diagnosed with PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome).\u00a0\u00a0Also if it helps, the Dr's never seem to be able to locate a fetus on ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0But sometime in the miscarriage process, my body does evacuate a small tissue filled cacoon looking thing.\u00a0\u00a0Where could the babies be attaching themselves to?\u00a0\u00a0Because this last time, June of 2009--- I had ultrasound after ultrasound and they saw nothing.\u00a0\u00a0But after being given Methotrexate, instead of a surgery to remove any products of conception---- this cacoon made of tissue came out!\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know of any studies be conducted?\u00a0\u00a0The Dr's never has any clue as to what's going on, but I've paid out so much money.\u00a0\u00a0Then this is very stressful on me, as a woman to even think that I might not never be able to have a baby",
