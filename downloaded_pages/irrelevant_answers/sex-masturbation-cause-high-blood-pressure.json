            "answer": "I don't think sex of any sort increases blood \"volume.\" It may redirect blood flow and even raise blood pressure momentarily but volume is something else. And I would never recommend \"cutting\" to reduce blood volume. Some people with high iron levels have to donate blood occasionally but that's something different.",

    "question": "Note: I am definitely no expert here \u2013 so that\u2019s why I\u2019m asking for advice on the issue (especially the following questions and related issues/attributes). Please read through the whole writing before responding to all of my questions/the issues (or at least the main one\u2019s) \u2013 and thank you. \uf04a\uf076\tMy question: Can the \u201csilent killer\u201d (high blood pressure) be caused/triggered by (too much) sex/masturbation?o\tDoes sex/masturbation increase the blood volume?\uf0a7\tIf not, then what are the effects of sex/masturbation (what role does it play)?\u2022\tIs (too much) sex/masturbation result in positive/negative consequences. What are they?\uf0a7\tIf so, is managing this blood volume through exercise the only control?\u2022\tOr can/should this also be assisted with reducing the blood volume through intended/unintended lose of blood (small/deep cuts, etc.), directly/indirectly giving/donating blood, etc.?o\tIs this true:\uf0a7\tThe heart size is increased due to (high) blood volume. But when the blood volume is lowered to the average point \u2013 exercising at this time creates maximum performance in exercising: running, sports etc (along with increased red blood cells through cold temperatures, etc.).o\tCould sex/masturbation actually be a cause/trigger of stress/anger management issues, (high) testosterone/pms, puberty (depth in voice, boost in muscle strength, pubes, lengthened genitals, different body odour etc.), and a whole lot of other bigger and smaller serious attachments alike and at different levels, etc.o\tAm I onto something (big) here (I don\u2019t know if someone else already has \u2013 hence I ask away in this writing). \uf04a\uf076\tHeart attack, etc. can be caused by:o\tHigh blood pressure (\u201cthe silent killer\u201d) which can be triggered by an unhealthy lifestyle:\uf0a7\t(Too much) sex/masturbation (especially ejaculation) = high/increases the blood volume (increases the amount of blood supply so your heart has to pump around more blood).\uf0a7\tHigh: sugar (diabetes), saturated/fat (blood cholesterol), salt intake (bad diet etc.)\uf0a7\tLack of exercise/obesity, etc.\uf0a7\tPossibly stress\uf0a7\tTaking good/bad drugs, alcohol, smoking, and other bad habits, etc.\uf0a7\t(Heart) diseases, illnesses etc.\uf076\tHeart attack, etc. can be prevented/managed by:\uf0a7\tNo/less sex/masturbation\uf0a7\tLow sugar, fat, salt intake (moderation/diet etc.)\uf0a7\tExercise regularly, correct weight etc.\uf0a7\tReduce blood volume (lose/give/donate blood, etc.).\uf0a7\tNot (or at least minimal/alternative): taking good/bad drugs, alcohol, smoking, and other bad habits, etc.\uf0a7\tSeeing doctor, medicine etc.",
