    "question": "I have been thinking a lot in the past few days and I am still having trouble with all the confusion these MD's are having. I have had numbness and tingling in my lower extremities .... starting with the left for at least 9 years. I only became a diabetic a few years ago so the sensations in my legs were not from diabetes back then. They came right out and said my brain atrophy looks like \"invisible \" lesions. I guess I am frustrated today because I am so fatigued. I also have had a swollen lymph node in my neck 2.4cm for 4 months. It has grown from a 1.2 from 1st test. ( ultrasound and CT). My PCP is sending me for a biopsy. Of course I have looked up lymphoma to start with . A few of the symptoms for that I have but I have had them on and off for years so no way to tell if something is new. My tests came back fine but my MD said that some do and it turns out to be different. ( even happened to her). My biopsy is the 19th. Has anyone else had this along with their MS? I was on the lymphoma forum and believe me, they are not as informative or responsive as all of you are .....",
