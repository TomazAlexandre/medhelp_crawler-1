            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There is a possibility that you have some problem with adrenal gland and probably diabetes insipidus. This causes extreme thirst and very diluted urine. A change in the cortisol metabolism can cause very high temperature. Please get this investigated.Also since your mother is a nurse ask her to get a panel for PUO done to know the cause of fever.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a 16 year old female, and for the past few months, I've been having odd symptyoms...About ten months ago, I got these bumps in the very back of my throat. When I went to the doctor, he said they were swollen lymph nodes, and to expect the to go away within a few weeks. However, I still have them, and now I'm beginning to get white spots on them.Around a month ago, I began getting these wierd fevers.. I'll have a normal temperature, but the all of a sudden, I will develop a really high fever. It would get higher and higher until I broke a sweat, and then it would quickly go away. This happens in less than five minutes, and it's been getting more frequent.I've also been getting abnormally thirsty. I feel like I ALWAYS need to be drinking, even when my stomach feels like it's about to explode. It's gotten to the point where my mom, who's a nurse, had to tell me to quit drinking water because I've been consuming it in unhealthy amounts. But I have this insatiable thirst, and if I don't drink, it feels like I can't breathe and I get dizzy and too hot.I'm definitely not pregnant or diabetic, and I eat normally. I haven't begun taking any new medications recently.I don't know what would cause this, but please help if you know anything.",
