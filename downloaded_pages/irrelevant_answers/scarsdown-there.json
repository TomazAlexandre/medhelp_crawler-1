            "answer": "Hi. It is possible to remove hair from this delicate area safely in future, and fade the scars.If you are going to shave do so in a lukewarm bath or shower and use a new razor each time. Use a good quality shaving gel or oil (not a foam as you can't see what you're doing) I recommend King Of Shaves. Pat the area afterwards with a clean soft towel. Then apply Vaseline or Elizabeth Arden 8 hour cream to prevent irritation.If you use a hair removing cream use one especially for your bikini line. Choose one which comes with an aftercare cream to prevent irritation.For the scarring use either Bio-oil or Palmers Cocoa Butter Scar Serum.Eloise.",

            "answer": "Hi,It could be eczema, sweat dermatitis, allergic reactions or folliculitis. This could most definitely be secondary to shaving.You need to wash the areas several times with fresh water. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites.Apply calamine lotion at the site of the lesions and see if it helps. You could take some oral antihistamine medications like cetrizine or loratadine. You need to maintain a good personal hygiene .Anti-itch drugs, often antihistamine, may reduce the itch during a flare up of eczema, and the reduced scratching in turn reduces damage and irritation to the skin.For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g. hydrocortisone or desonide), whilst more severe cases require a higher-potency steroid (e.g. clobetasol propionate, fluocinonide).Eczema can be exacerbated by dryness of the skin. Moisturizing is one of the most important self-care treatments for sufferers of eczema. Keeping the affected area moistened can promote skin healing and relief of symptoms.Folliculitis is infection and inflammation of the hair follicles. The condition may be superficial (i.e., on the surface of the skin) or deep within the follicles.The most common cause of folliculitis is infection by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus.Folliculitis symptoms can appear independent of infection. Exposure of the skin to certain chemicals, especially oils and tars, can trigger an outbreak. People with depressed immune systems, diabetes, or obesity have a greater risk of contracting folliculitis than the general population.Be extremely careful about personal hygiene. Application of antiseptic washes may help prevent recurrences. A topical antibiotic cream, mupirocin (Bactroban\u00ae), has been effective at reducing bacterial colonization in the nostrils. It is applied twice daily for a week and is repeated every 6 months.Let us know if you need any further information.Regards.",

            "answer": "shaving the pubic region causes hair bumps, which is a form of folliculitis. they itch TERRIBLY, but its not eczema. and its not considered a pimple. the hair in the pubic region (though gross) is not made to be removed. Hair is in those places to keep microorganisms out and prevent infection. my suggestion would be to quit SHAVING IT, and trim. =)",
