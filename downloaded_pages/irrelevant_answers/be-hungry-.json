But until I realized it I packed on a lot of weight!",

            "answer": "I think your right about the blood sugar and hormones being off balance. Sometimes if a drink a coke (not often bc of the caffeine) I feel back to normal and ok until its time to eat again. But I know I can't go around drinking coke all day but for some reason it helps a lot.",

    "question": "I don't know if it's just me but I'm 18 weeks now and sometime I really feel like I'm about to die if I don't hurry up and eat something! I know this sounds so dramatic but that's how I feel! All of a sudden I'm hungry all the time and if I don't eat right when I start feeling hungry I start feeling so sick. Like for one I get migraines and my stomach starts killing me! Anyone else feel this way??",
