            "answer": "It's possible he's developing a mild oral infection from the scaling (it's an unfortunate occasional possibility). It's also possible there's a pocket infection the vet missed (not his fault neccessarily, it does happen. Kitty can't express complaints).Gently check the immediate jaw area for any swelling. If there is, see if the vet can move up the appointment.Otherwise... kitties can have allergies, although the do seem to be more affected by\u00a0\u00a0household products than pollen. The problem is if kitty can't smell his food, they generally won't eat it. I'd consult your vet and have the nasal passages checked to be sure there isn't a serious issue.",

            "answer": "You want to make sure that your kitty continues to eat, even if you have to force feed him after a few days, because cats who don't eat for a prolonged period of time can develop feline hepatic lipidosis, or fatty liver disease.\u00a0\u00a0While this is more common in overweight cats, it can affect any cat who goes for a long time without eating.\u00a0\u00a0This is not to say that it WILL happen, but it IS a risk, so it's better to force feed and be safe than allow the cat to not eat and be facing a potentially life-threatening illness later.If nothing else, try to get a few fingers of NutriCal into your cat each day until he starts to show an interest in food again.\u00a0\u00a0It truly could mean the difference between life and death.\u00a0\u00a0There is a commonly held belief that an animal won't starve itself to death, and it will eat if it gets hungry enough.\u00a0\u00a0This is true for dogs, but with cats, if they wait too long and fatty liver disease sets in, it's very difficult to bring them back and it could mean they will die.\u00a0\u00a0Please understand, I am not trying to scare you, but I have had two cats with this.\u00a0\u00a0One I was able to save.\u00a0\u00a0The other one I ended up losing after a heartbreaking battle to save him.\u00a0\u00a0I'm just trying to save others the heartache of having to go through the same pain.Ghilly",

            "answer": "Thanks, I totally missed on that part (rusty brain). Dehydration is a huge danger with cats and the danger is in terms of days. Since most of their water intake comes from food...Another good product is The KMR Milk replacer, using a feeding syringe if kitty won't drink. There's numerous ailments that onset from starvation/dehydration that lead to long term health issues. The KMR is a nutrient packed food that almost all cats love more than cream itself (umm...don't give kitty cream. Cats are lactose intolerant!).I'm assuming that NutriCal is a similar product, but I thought I'd suggest this one as it's not to pricey and it's always good to have options depending on store stock.",

            "answer": "Hi there,I hope your cat started eating again? Mine did this in October. He stopped eating, we took him to the vet. The vet said he had allergies, gave him meds. My cat still didn't eat so we brought him back. It turned out that his allergies affected his pancreas and he developed secondary diabetes. We had to leave our cat at the animal hospital for one full week because he wouldn't eat. He was on IV. Once a cat stops eating, he/she loses the interest to eat. It is very diffucult to get them to start up again. They put him on Diazepam to stimulate his appetite. Once he got his appetite back, he was good to come home. At home, we had to give him the diazepam for 2 days when we saw that he wasn't eating. Now, 5 months later, he is eating well (trust me, he would be obese if we let him) and we give him 2 injections a day.Now, I'm not saying that your cat has diabetes but I would contact the vet to stimulate his appetite. He may not give you meds but he may give you strategies that work. It is very important that he starts eating again.",

    "question": "My cat (14 year old Persian) started eating a lot less about a week ago.\u00a0\u00a0He started just eating the juice out of his canned food, but now won't even eat that.\u00a0\u00a0I took him to the vet last Thursday, he had his teeth cleaned, heavy scaling.\u00a0\u00a0(He has his teeth cleaned once a year.)\u00a0\u00a0The vet also gave him a number of tests that all came out good. The day after the teeth cleaning he ate quite a bit, (mostly liquid) but on Saturday, Sunday and today he refuses to eat once again.\u00a0\u00a0He drank a little water yesterday.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if the lack of interesst in food could be soreness from the scaling.\u00a0\u00a0He also has a very damp nose and he does seem to get seasonal allergies.\u00a0\u00a0Could the lack of interest in eating be caused by allergies? Or do you have any other ideas?\u00a0\u00a0I have another vet appointement for him this coming Friday, but would greatly appreciate any insight you may have.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
