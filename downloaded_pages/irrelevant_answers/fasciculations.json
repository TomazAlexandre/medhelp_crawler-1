            "answer": "I have been going onto the ms forum for several months, but was recently told that I most likely don't have ms (due to a spinal tap). I am not familiar with ALS, but some of my symptoms are similar to those on this forum. I have had many tests done since my weakness and other symptoms started 3 months ago. I did have an EMG 3 weeks ago and it was not done by a doctor. I guess that should be a concern, huh? Please let me know your symptoms/history.",

    "question": "I'm 40 and starting to get confused (perhaps a bit scared too).I've started getting twitches and fasciculations in my arms and abdomen.\u00a0\u00a0This is after I was experiencing crampyness in my calf and upper arm muscles,\u00a0\u00a0arm/hand/shoulder fatigue, and overall fatigue (tiredness).\u00a0\u00a0Naturally this pointed me to ALS when doing on-line research.\u00a0\u00a0I had blood glucose testing (for diabetes) and an NCV/EMG last week which came back with no problems.\u00a0\u00a0They tested mostly on one hand and forearm.\u00a0\u00a0I seem to be getting more fatigued by the day.\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned that the EMG test is not reliable and that I should be retested.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a valid issue....what else can I do (have a MRI scheduled in 2weeks) and what should I be looking for.",
