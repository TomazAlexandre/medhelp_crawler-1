            "answer": "The proper physician to see to diagnose your ED is a urologist who specializes in ED.\u00a0\u00a0The most common cause of ED is probably diabetes, and since most guys ignore their health until it affects the thing they care about - their erections - this is often what causes them to find out they have something like diabetes or thyroid disease.\u00a0\u00a0You need to find out what's going on since it could be much more than just your erections, but fixing the issue is the first thing to do to fix your erections.\u00a0\u00a0If you smoke, stop, because the vascular problems smoking causes will kill your erections fast.",

    "question": "Hi. I'm 22 and recently thought I may have an std causing erectile dysfunction that started kinda slow and rapidly got worse over the past year to most function of my penis is gone. Someone told me it couldn't be an std cause no std could cause that and its my problem forr sure. When I was four I was diagnosed with embroyonal sarcoma.. maybe spelled that wrong but I beat it twice and was good from six on and I haven't been to the neurology doc in a few years cause its been 15 years. But if it can't be an std.. is it from chemo? I had no radiation but erectile dysfunction is destroying my life. Could it be helped or corrected and what could be causing it? Is it possible cancer is a back? Thanks",
