            "answer": "Maybe your taking your mothers concern wrong. Maybe... because the things she told u to cut back on all lead to gestational diabetes or diabetes in general if you're not pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I just got diagnosed with it and its no fun. Didn't have it with my other pregnancies but starchie foods turn into sugar and also my baby too large to pass through birth canal. If it was hurtful I'm sure as parent u understand somethings are not meant to be hurtful but we take it that way. You're a mother and I don't know how old your children are but there will definitely be things that you'll have\u00a0\u00a0to say that are for their good but it will be taken in a way u didn't mean. As adults we don't like our parents still telling us things but I'd rather it be my mom verses a stranger or even the doctor telling me now it's turned into a problem. Remember she's done this before too and nothing about the natural process has changed love",

    "question": "my parents are discussing my weight :/\u00a0\u00a0i was a little stick figure before so obviously you can tell my weight gain especially since im one month and a half away from having my baby. I just feel its so unneccessary to talk about it. My mom told me my dad noticed im heavier and why does my mom tell me this? She then tells me i need to cut back on bread, tortillas and desserts etc. Which i understand, but sometimes thats all there is to eat and i eat very small portions. Anyway, ive gained about 20 pounds less than last pregnancy so im proud of myself. And i know i can loose the baby weight like i did last year. Im not obsessing over my weight this time around, about my looks, nor loosing baby weight faster than the recommended 9 months. Im loving my body in every stage of life Im in and right now its the 3rd trimester.I know i dont have to explain my eating and exercising to anyone including my family so i just thought hearing other pregnant ladies are going through the same thing will help me not get emotional about it, especially with these pregnancy hormones :)",
