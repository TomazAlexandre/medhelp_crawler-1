I think you have a condition called over active bladder which causes, urge to urinate frequently, urgency and urge incontinence.The usual treatments for this condition are pelvic muscle strengthening exercises, behavioural therapy and medication( detrol la) etc. Also, if you are urinating very frequently check the amount of fluid intake, check blood sugars and get a urine analysis with culture done.Before going in for any over the counter medicines I would advise to visit a urologist for confirmation of diagnosis and further assistance on treatment.Best.",
