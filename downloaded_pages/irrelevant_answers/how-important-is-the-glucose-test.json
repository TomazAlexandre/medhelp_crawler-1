            "answer": "I never did it for my first pregnancy. Did it for my second. Probably won't bother for my third. If you eat a low GI diet anyway then thats mainly the management plan you'd get anyway if you had it unless it was really bad... so if you can't do the test the next best option is to eat healthy with low sugar, and you'd be doing your baby and body a favour anyway as well as effectively managing diabetes if you just happened to have it.",

            "answer": "Your dr told you to fast for 8 hours? My dr did not have me fast at all, and I have seen several woman say their drs told them not to eat anything really sweet right before and that's it. Can't you just schedule it for first thing in the morning, so you don't eat while your sleeping, take the test, then have some breakfast and go to work? I would say based on your weight gain etc you probably don't have it, but if you were to have it, the effects of not maintaining it for you and the baby are so severe I wouldn't risk it.",

            "answer": "You really should have it done. For the 1 hour you dont have to fast. If you fail the 1 hour they have you do a 3 hour test where you need to fast 8-10 hours. Eventhough your further along its important to have it done as if you do have gestatiknal diabetes it needs to bw kept under control. It can also be dangerous to the baby if ita not controlled.",

Ik there are,a few doctors that have you fast but I dont personally know any nor have any of my friends or family had to fast I think it's dumb personally. But #1to make it easier on you all your succor had to was give you the order for it and you could have shown up to any lab before going into work and they would send the results to doctor. I can't imagine that route would have been impossible to just possibly be a bit late to work fur pregnancy related care.",
