Your doctor will need to test a stool sample to rule this out.",

    "question": "My mother is 59 years old. No hx of colon cancer in our family, although her father had benign colon polyps in his 70s. No history of any kind of cancer in family.My Mother is healthy except for high bp and type 2 diabetes. She is on bp med, metformin, 1 aspirin per day and i cant remember what other meds.She has been on this medifast diet for about maybe 5 years. She eats this medifast \"food\" and then a salad and chicken for dinner.\u00a0\u00a0 She is very much a wine-drinker.So anyway, for several years she says that sometimes when straining, she passes blood with stool. Assumed it was a hemorrhoid so paid no attention to it. Just occasional blood in stool. In the past few months, there is more blood with stool and she has mostly diarrhea when she goes. Not a lot of formed stools now.OK so about a month ago, there started to be small amounts of mucous with the stool (and still blood).\u00a0\u00a0 Now in the past 2 weeks, the blood and mucous are even more volume. and it is every time.She says sometimes she will feel like she has to poop, and goes poop and it is only a lot of blood-tinged mucous and nothing else. Straight pooping mucous.Over a month ago the doctor told her that she has no occult blood IN the stool.\u00a0\u00a0So the blood is coming out only when pooping or diarrhea.Blood does not leak out any other time. Only when poop.She has no fever. NO pain whatsoever, no fatigue, same appetite and otherwise feels normal.\u00a0\u00a0No pain at all. No weakness.But is very concerned about the large amounts of mucous now and blood, especially increasing over the past 2 weeks.Does this sound like cancer or what does it sound like?\u00a0\u00a0She has a colonoscopy scheduled for 4 days from now - but we are all terrified.",
