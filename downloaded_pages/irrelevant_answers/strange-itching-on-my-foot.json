I usually make sure I do some toe touches/leg stretches when that happens, and it seems to go away. But I would like to know if anyone else knows what this is (as I'm definitely NOT a doctor lol)",

    "question": "I have a very weird itch on my foot. It has been happening for about the past month or so and flares up every couple of hours. The itch is always in the exact same place and there is no visible rash or bump or anything where it itches. I don't have it anywhere else except the bottom of my left foot. I don't have any family history of diabetes and I am not over weight. The spot is directly in the middle of my foot up by the ball of my foot. There isn't any calluses near the spot. It is not an itch like dry skin or athletes foot. It feels like it is deeper in the tissue that that. I have not been using and new soap or insoles and there doesn't seem to be anything that triggers it. I am at a loss on this one?",
