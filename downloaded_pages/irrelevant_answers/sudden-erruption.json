            "answer": "I recommend that you both take the time this weekend to read the free herpes handbook at www.westoverheights.com to learn more about herpes in general. Next week, give your doctor(s) a call and ask for type specific herpes igg blood testing to be done on both of you so you can see who has what. Once you have those results, we can better start figuring out if this is herpes related or not since no lesion cultures were done.did the doctor by chance say herpes zoster - better known as shingles?grace",

            "answer": "Hi Grace,Thanks again for the prompt response.We will definitely go through the site as suggested by you to learn more....Why do I have to take the blood testing because he is the patient, not me.The doctor asked whether my husband had chicken pox earlier, which he did when he was young and said that usually those who have had chicken pox contract herpes.But since taking medication for the past five days, the pain in his leg is tremendous which keeps him awake every night - medicines are not taking effect.....The lesion has got a little bigger and is more sore and red and painful.Pl suggest !!Thanks very much.",

            "answer": "If he's getting worse, he should be seen monday again.why you getting tested too? If this is herpes simplex, if he recently contracted it from you it might not reflect in his blood test. also if this is herpes simplex you'd need tested anyways to know your own status.Having had chicken pox has nothing to do with herpes simplex. I have a feeling his provider was referring to herpes zoster ( aka shingles ) and not herpes simplex ( aka oral and genital herpes ).\u00a0\u00a0Have your husband call monday to get clarification on what the doctor thought was going on.grace",

    "question": "Hello,About a week back my husband discovered a small cluster of red blisters on his lower back - didnt think anything of it but a rash....two days later, it appeared on the back of his right leg - there was pain right down from his back through to his leg.\u00a0\u00a0He visited a dermatogolist and was told it was herpes and is taking medication for the same.My questions are :Can it be cured or does it stay forever.What has caused this to just suddenly appear.Will it affect his nervous system.Is it contageous.How long will it take to treat the same and be cured.Thank you for your time and your forthcoming response.God bless.",
