I pray that you get pregnant again and have a wonderful full term pregnancy.Just curious, why did they test you for Group B strep\u00a0\u00a0so early? I didnt think they did that until like 36 weeks.

            "answer": "I'm a 21 year old prom sufferer. Early one morning before my husband went back to work after PT, I woke up due to stomach cramps. When I went to the restroom my membrane ruptured and I went into labor. Fortunately my labor stopped, thank God. Our doctor then told myself and my husband that we would have to let them induce labor and let our child expire. That, of course, was not an option. So we decided to wait it out. Because if I was not in labor, there was no reason why I should have had to watch my child die that day. The doctor was very upset with our decision so much so that he passed us off to everyone he could. From the nurses, to the midwives, even to his daughter who has barely been practicing for a year. He then went on vacation while I was lying in a hospital bed. He even told us that our little girl would not live three days. Well, she proved him wrong and lived 10, even with a prolapsed cord. On May 1st our baby (Joy Renee) was pronounced dead through ultrasound. Later on that day I was induced, my doctor... nowhere to be found. This however was not the end of my agony. At my 6 wk check up I discovered that my \"doctor\" had not made any notes in my file back at his office. The nurses, while looking at my file, were asking me how was my baby doing. And the midwife, whom the doctor had assigned, had to go to him and asking him what my prognosis was and what we should do now. Needless to say, I left that office irate, disappointed, and hurt. But my road to recovery hit yet another bump. One month after her death, we were waiting to receive her death certificate. It was then that we found out that the doctor was holding it on his desk and had not signed it yet. And now almost four months later it still hasn't come yet. Please pray for me that GOD will guide me in what to do. Because at this point with all that has come forth and has taken place. I could possibly have the power to end his career or hurt his credibility, by coming forth and telling of my experience.",
