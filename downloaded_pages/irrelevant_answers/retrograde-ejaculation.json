            "answer": "Retrograde ejeculation is the process where the semen is deposited into the bladder instead of out of the penis. This most likely would be due to surgery or damage to the sphyncter near the prostate.It can cause furtility problems but does not cause any other problems.I myself experienced this at the age of 30 while undergoing prostate and bladder surgery. I'm 45 now and still alive.I hope that puts a stop on your worries.God bless,Ron",
