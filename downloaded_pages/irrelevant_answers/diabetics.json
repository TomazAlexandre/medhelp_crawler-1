She asked me to think hard about getting a tubal ligation and that she thinks a c-section is my best option for a safe delivery (due to other complications). I am not currently on insulin but was told I may have to go on insulin by the end of the pregnancy. Hardest thing for me at the moment is craving sweets that i know i can't have. I walk 2x a day for 20mins and watch my carb intake. I also just moved and because of my finical situation i went to the local Dhs office n applied for medical assistance. They helped me find a doc that while admits my health isnt the greatest she is helping me with a plan to have as healthy pregnancy n baby as possible.",

And anytime I would ask my ob about preparing my body for pregnancy, my endo would get really pissy and make me feel like hell because I didn't need a baby if my diabetes wasn't in control.For me, I work with my endocrinologist, my regular ob, and two high risk diabetic pregnancy ob. My hish risk Dr s.told me if I can get my sugars under control that I can deliver in a regular l&d otherwise I would have to go to the high risk one 3 hours away. And somehow, my sugar started dropping to 75 when eating ice cream and cake but would spike 300+ if I took my insulin. My endo won't listen and thinks I'm still taking my insulin. Dr s says to stop taking the insulin but to just watch my sugars. Well my a1c dropped to 5.5 and hasn't moved.For delivery I'm going for all natural vaginal, but unless baby decides to come before 39 weeks 3 days I will be induced at 39.3. Dr s said that going to 40 weeks when your a preexisting diabetic is very concerning and in his study and experience has seen more still borns from diabetic mothers going 40+ weeks. So for my baby's safety we are going to 39.3 if she's not here before.",
