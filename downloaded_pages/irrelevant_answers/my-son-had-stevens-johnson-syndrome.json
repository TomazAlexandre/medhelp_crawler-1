            "answer": "Hi!Unexplained aches and pains with white spots on hands are unlikely to be due to Stevens-Johnson-Syndrome per se, but can be due to extreme weakness after the attack. Good nutrition and diet care may help. However, unexplained aches and pains with white spots coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In men it can be due to low testosterone. Do discuss this with your son's doctor and get him examined. Take care!",

    "question": "My 17-year-old son just recently got over a bout of Stevens-Johnson syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't involve his skin, only his eyes, very severely, and his mouth, with horrible sores inside his mouth and his tongue.\u00a0\u00a0He also had them inside his penis, and it hurt to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't hospitalized, although he lost 12 pounds, and he seemed to be on the mend.\u00a0\u00a0However, now he has aching all over, in his muscles, and even in his finger joints.\u00a0\u00a0He also has a few white spots on his hands.\u00a0\u00a0Do you suppose this could still be the SJS \"running through his system,\" or could he have developed another type of autoimmune disorder?\u00a0\u00a0I'm concerned and am not sure what to do next.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much.",
