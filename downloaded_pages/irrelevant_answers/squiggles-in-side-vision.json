            "answer": "Even though she's not having headaches, this still could be migraine related.\u00a0\u00a0Some people only get visual auras and not headaches (lucky them!).Have you been able to correlate when she's seeing these squiggles to certain times of the month?\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if maybe she's beginning to enter puberty and the change in hormones is causing the \"auras\".\u00a0\u00a0Many women who have migraines or migraine type activity (like auras) do find that they tend to coincide with either their ovulation or when they are having their period.Also see if you can correlate these squiggles to after her eating or drinking certain things - chocolate, MSG, dairy, gluten, nitrates are some of the biggest migraine triggers.I know you said she doesn't have headaches and I'm only referring to this as \"migraine\" because if they are auras, some of these things could be triggers for them even without headaches.You may want to consider having her checked by a neurologist just to make sure everything is ok with the brain itself since you've already taken her to an opthomologist and he has ruled out an eye problem.Best of luck.",
