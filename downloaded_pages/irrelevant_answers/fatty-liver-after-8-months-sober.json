            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. Cirrhosis will show characteristic changes on the ultrasonography and liver function tests will further help in the evaluation. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding alcohol and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
