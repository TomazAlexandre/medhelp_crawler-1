    "question": "Hi there - This is a long story, but I'll try to keep details to a minimum. I am a 50-year-old woman. For over three months now, I've had pins and needles, tingling, static-feeling on skin surface, and all kinds of related, weird skin sensations in both feet and both legs. This came up out of the blue, and I've literally had it every single day, fairly constantly to at least some extent, since it began. I was extremely worried about MS - haven't had a brain MRI yet, but MRI of all 3 sections of spine is clear. For various reasons my doctor does not suspect MS, thank goodness, though I'm still worried about that (though I guess this would be a weird presentation).Anyway, blood work was normal - EXCEPT for slightly low B12 (275). I realize that's in the normal range, but my doctor says in some people that is low enough to create symptoms like mine. Long story short, I began B12 injections and had 12 in about 6 weeks. I was extremely discouraged since even when I'd get a small glimmer of hope that I might be improving, it would all come back again just as bad as ever (and never completely was gone, either, even for a short time).Well, unexpectedly, after I'd had these 12 shots over 6 weeks, I suddenly had a few days stretch where I honestly DID feel better - I would go hours or even most of a day without feeling the symptoms at all. It definitely wasn't completely gone, since then I WOULD feel the symptoms again, and sometimes quite intensely. But as far as breaks where I truly felt better, this was a real difference in contrast to all the weeks leading up to this.This period of slight improvement has been going on for about 10 days now. As I said, it's not like these sensations are completely gone by any means. BUT in the overall scheme of things, for the first time I'm feeling there's some hope (maybe)!!??I realize I am rambling and should get to my questions. Has anyone had this specific type of symptom from B12 deficiency - that is, the tingling/pins and needles/etc..? (I don't have numbness or pain). AND - could it be very possible that yes, the B12 injections ARE just now starting to make a difference? Or if this truly is all caused by a B12 deficiency, should I have felt more relief earlier?I'm just trying to figure out if low B12 could actually be the cause for these symptoms in my legs and feet - I really don't have the other B12 symptoms people talk about. IF it's possible the injections are working and the cause IS B12, I will be so happy - I won't worry so much that it's something else and I'm completely content to ride it out, however long the recovery may be.Thanks so much for anyone who would be willing to respond!",
