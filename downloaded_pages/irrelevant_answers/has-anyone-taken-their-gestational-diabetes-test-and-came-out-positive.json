Just remember not to eat or drink anything for 12 hours before your 2nd test and you will be fine. And take a book or something with you, 3 hours feel really long just sitting there. Good luck!",

            "answer": "I test 4 times a day and do 2 types of insulin twice a day. I've never had it either with my other kids. Baby can be large and at birth can be jaundice and when the cord is cut baby blood sugar can drop dramatically so they give baby an iv to regulate blood sugars. High risk for adolescent diabetes for baby. But everything can be managed with diet and if needed medications or insulin. Hang in there, plenty of us moms have it you are not alone",
