            "answer": "where are you getting that reference range from?? is it on the actual test? is it referrencing mg/l, because 10 and lower is considered normal..Anyways, even if it is high, its indiciative of infection or inflammation , SOMEWHERE in the body, which can be alot of issues non cardiac related.... Most positive levels are in the hundreds.. There are other similar tests that can be had to confirm or dismiss a certain finding.",

            "answer": "sorry, i didnt address the second part of that question.. I would be under the impression that if you where labeled \"high\", in the scope of testing crp strictly for cardiac uses, that this would indicate an increased risk factor for future issues(similarly to how high cholesterol can be a risk factor)",

            "answer": "testing crp to try and indicate a future cardiac risk is still fairly new.. From what i gather, all they really know is that a 3+ normal level (as in what your natural level is) can indicate an increased risk of heart disease and stroke in women, there hasnt been a study involving men that i am aware of... the odd thing about it is, they cannot confirm that bringing down the crp level will bring down the \"increased risk\"... There are studies being conducted right now that will shed more light to whether or not this would be relevent....",

            "answer": "You are too kind for responding!\u00a0\u00a0I really appreciate your input.The reference range was listed on the lab report under the result.\u00a0\u00a0It actually shows the number (5mg/l) in red and indicates it as a high level.My cholesterol was 162Triglycerides 77HDL 46LDL 100.6Chol/HDL 3.52All the other cardiac profile numbers were normal except, CK-MB which was \"below detectable limits\" and Alk Phos which was high.I have only really looked at the CRP because I read a couple articles a while back that placed it with heart.The one thing that is making sense to me is what you said about \"increased risk factor for future issues\".\u00a0\u00a0It is quite possible that my mom, sister and that whole side of the family would have a high CRP (it's the side with all the heart/diabetes/HBP problems) but just have never been tested.Do you know if there is a way to reduce the number?\u00a0\u00a0Like with cholesterol?\u00a0\u00a0I see the cardio next month so I think you've really eased my mind until then!!Thanks so much!",

            "answer": "I do know CRP can be a marker for a few imflammatory processes of the heart.\u00a0\u00a0My understanding is that (coronary artery disease) CAD is thought to be at least partly inflammatory.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't clear whether CRP is the telltale sign, or if CRP is part of the cause.",

    "question": "Hi again!I will try to make this one short, I have a followup with a cardio at the Mayo Clinic next month but I've just received my records from there and in reviewing my labs came across the CRP result.Mine was 5.\u00a0\u00a0It was a high sensitivity CRP test and the lab standards are:less than 1=low risk1-3=moderate riskgreater than 3=high riskObviously that puts me at a high risk!!\u00a0\u00a0BUT... if the CRP test is just a MARKER for inflammation and not necessarily pinpointed to the heart, why is it under lipid cardiac panel?\u00a0\u00a0I have only read about it being used in relation to the heart.See, this is what happens when the test results get into the \"wrong\" (read...uncardioeducated) hands!!!Does anyone have any knowledge of this test?",
