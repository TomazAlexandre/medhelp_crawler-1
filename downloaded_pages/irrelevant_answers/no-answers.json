            "answer": "When did he start to bleed? This was something new and sudden, or it came slowly through days?Is he taking any medicines?I also doubt about the virus, at least intestinal virus. Do you think those purple spots on the skin are like under-skin bleeding?It sounds like emergency, do you have any general emergency department, except your GP?",

            "answer": "Please go to the doctor right now, it could be some systemic reaction (many causes, check the link below) which causes generalized bleeding, maybe a part of disseminated intravascular coagulation. This could be from snake bite, medicine, infection...http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disseminated_intravascular_coagulationThe doctor doesn't need to be GI, any internist on a emergency department should be of help.",

            "answer": "With endo you mean endoscopy? Which one upper one or colonoscopy? What was the cause of that blockage you've ment in the first post? Virus isn't enough to cause blockage.Is he constipated otherwise? Both that blockage and vasculitis may be caused by uncontrolled diabetes. He should really arrange this with the help of endocrinologist.Those changes in the throat were probably not from infection, but the same as in the skin - bleeding.",
