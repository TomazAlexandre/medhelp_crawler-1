            "answer": "\" I am an an athelete and of small stature so I have been told that I am unlikely to have diabetes or any heart conditions:Whomever told you this is incorrect. Adverse heath conditions can occur with anyone athletic or non-athletic, at any age, short, tall, skinny or fat whether it be diabetes, something with your cardiovascular system, COPD [Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease], and so on. Without proper testing no one can make a determination one way or the other. For all we know your issues could stem from something as simple as food allergies. Get off the computer and call a doctor for a full health check-up. And, make it part of your life to see your doctor for an annual health check-up too. Good luck -",

            "answer": "I went to my family doctor and she was the one that told me that. She refused to do tests or any type of check up for that matter. She said that it will just go away what ever it is. But after your comment I went to seek a second opinion. I got blood tests done and an x-ray and will be seeing a cardiologist. Keeping my fingers crossed as I get my results tomorrow. Hopefully I am ok and my family doctor was right, but I am still very scared as the chest pains have not subsided.",

            "answer": "Good to see you sought a second opinion and a cardiologist too. Even if your chest pains subsided wouldn't you want to know what caused them? I would, I would also want to know how to prevent it from occurring again. It's always sad to hear about a doctor who could care less about a patients well being. Ditch 'em, find one that does. Good luck -",
