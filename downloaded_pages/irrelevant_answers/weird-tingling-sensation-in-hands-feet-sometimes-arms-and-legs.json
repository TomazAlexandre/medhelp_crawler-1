            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Claritin will normally not cause tingling. Headache, insomnia, dry mouth, seizures, red eyes, fatigue etc have been reported.The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. There are many causes of this nerve disorder including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Demyelinating peripheral neuropathies like Gullian Barre Syndrome is another possibility. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into.Hope this helps. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. You should also consult an allergy specialist and take an allergy test. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Interesting...\u00a0\u00a0Although, when I searched for more info. on Claritin side effects, \"tingling\" and \"leg cramps\" were rare side effects (see link below).\u00a0\u00a0It seems as though there could be too much of a correlation between the medicine and what's going on with me for this not to all be related.\u00a0\u00a0After reviewing the link, please let me know additional thoughts.I've also included a different link that relates to another individual experiencing similar symptoms with Claritin-D.\u00a0\u00a0Seems like it could all be connected, after all.\u00a0\u00a0Thoughts?Link(s):http://www.offshorerx.com/drug/buy_generic_claritin.htm#6 (see less common side effects)http://www.devdaily.com/blog/post/personal/side-effect-using-claritin-d/",

    "question": "I started taking Claritin this Monday morning for allergies (red eyes, etc...).\u00a0\u00a0Towards the end of Monday night, I had a horrible leg cramp in my right leg and began to start feeling a tingling sensation in my feet/hands on Tuesday.\u00a0\u00a0Since Tuesday, this tingling sensation has come and gone, leaving me to believe that there's a correlation between the Claritin and the side effects I'm feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I did a little research and it looks like they could be related.Does anyone know if these two could be related?\u00a0\u00a0I took regular Claritin on both Monday/Tuesday morning this week.\u00a0\u00a0It's now Thursday and I'm still feeling these sensations.\u00a0\u00a0If this is related, any clue how long this might last?\u00a0\u00a0I'm really worried and want this to stop!\u00a0\u00a0PLEASE HELP!!!",
