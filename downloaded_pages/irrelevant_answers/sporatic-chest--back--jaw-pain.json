Doctors don't know how to diagnose it as the symptoms are all over the place. I'm 28 in good health with a family history of diabetes and high blood pressure.",

    "question": "I am a 21 year old female in good health with a family history of hign blood pressure, diabetes and I had one grandparent die of a heartattack in old age. The problem I am having is a sporatic bout of very intense pain in the center of my chest, between my shoulder blades and in my jaw. It will last anywhere from 5 - 30 minutes and usually occurs at night while I'm in bed. I've been woken up by the pain before and it is very scary. It feels like I'm having a heartattack, but then the pain subsides and goes away. These bursts of pain occur every few months and I haven't been able to recoginize anything similar about the times the pain occurs, such as food I ate, etc. It seems completely random and once the pain begins there's no stopping it until it goes away on its own. I have no idea what could be causing this pain, but am obviously worried it has something to do with heart disease. Has anyone experiences this kind of intense pain before or have any idea what could be causing it? Any advice would be helpful. Thanks so much.",
