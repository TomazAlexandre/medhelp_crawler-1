            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!I read through your post very carefully and based on that I feel that you could possibly be suffering from glove-and-stocking neuropathy. There are many causes of this nerve disorder including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Demyelinating peripheral neuropathies like Gullian Barre Syndrome is another possibility. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into.Another possibility is MS but your brain MRI would have caught that.Hope this helps. Do discuss these possibilities with your doctor and get yourself examined accordingly. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I have been tested for diabetes twice, blood sugar (fasting) is normal, thyroid also normal, LFTs normal, kidney tests normal, calcium test normal, B12 normal. MRI was without contrast, if that helps. I live in the UK, so if I mention any diseases or prblems, they will automatically assume it is all psychosematic, silly I know.The pins and needles started in my hands, then after 2-3 months started in my feet. I was first tested for carpel tunnel as it was only in my hands then. A nerve conduction study was normal, was only done on my hands. Does GB syndrome really fit as this all started a year ago.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for the update!Multiple sclerosis, Lyme\u2019s disease, Cervical root irritation, TIA should all be ruled out. I can understand your hesitancy in suggesting diseases. However you can discuss the symptoms with your PCP and get appropriate referral.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Been having pins and needles in my hands and feet, with nerve type pain for a year now, I get slight sensation changes in my big toes and sometimes the odd finger, with intense burning sensations in feet. A clear MRI and bloods and NCS. It comes and goes. Recently I have been having trouble finishing sentences/conversations and finding some words, sensations have started in my lip and face with eye twitching. Little muscle twitching in my hands, legs and stomach. Over the past 2 days it has all got worse. I have felt dizzy, shaky (eventhough I am not shaking on the outside), I keep seeing little dots infront of my eyes and the worst symptom is intense buzzing / pins and needles feeling in my thumb, so bad at times I couldnt use it or the sensation would make me feel sick. It seems to have settled a little today though. I know I need to go back to my GP and maybe my neurologist, but I don't want them to think I am making it up.",
