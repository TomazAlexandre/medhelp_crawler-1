            "answer": "Hi,You mentioned about an MRI being done.Do you have the results?Migraine has been shown to be associated with silent MRI changes such as white matter abnormalities (WMA).The signficance of these findings are yet to be defined. Complex migraines have to be differentiated from a stroke through a complete neurologic and physical examination. CT Scan and MRI may supplement and help confirm the focus if this is\u00a0\u00a0a stroke.Migraines however are of a different mechanism. They are associated with the dilation and spasm of blood vessels.Headaches appear during vasodilation and neurologic deficits may appear during spasms.Second opinion may help since these conditions may also be present in other diseases like multiple sclerosis, medication side effects,diabetes and vitamin deficiencies.Further tests might be required to rule out these other differentials.I hope this helps.Keep us posted for anything.",

            "answer": "HI, who told you it was just complex migraine?\u00a0\u00a0A doctor or neurologist?\u00a0\u00a0I personally if I were you definately get a second opinion and if you have not already seen one, see a neurologists.\u00a0\u00a0Agree that more testing needs to be done if they havnt already been done.Blood tests etc.\u00a0\u00a0Was there just an MRI of brain? What about MRI if spine/spinal cord?Whilst there are types of migraines out there that can cause some symptoms without headache if you do not feel happy with this diagnosis then definately get a second opinion.Good luck",

            "answer": "Have you had blood tests done? I suffer from prolonged auras and I am a registered nurse and have researched treatment for it and have been seeing a neurologist for over a year and a half. Have you been worked up for Multiple Sclerosis or Lupus, both of which can cause the symptoms you are having as well as changes on MRI. Have you heard of a hemipalegic migraine? Sometimes those suffering from complex migraine can have this form which causes numbness timgling and even paralysis. My motto is when in doubt ALWAYS get a second oppinion and research this stuff yourself too.",
