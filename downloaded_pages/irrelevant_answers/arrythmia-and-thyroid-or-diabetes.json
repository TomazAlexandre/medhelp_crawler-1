            "answer": "Hi everyone. My daughter is going to be 5 this yr. When she was about 6 mnths. old I was rocking her and feeding her when I suddenly felt like my heart actually stopped a beat. When it started again, which of course didn't take long, it was a very HARD pound and palpatated quickly. I was very dizzy and this happened off and on for some time. I would sweat but I was constipated and lost tons of weight. I was diagnosed with Graves disease, VERY over active thyroid. It definately sounds to me like a thyroid problem although if your gaining weight and have diarreha I think it's a very under active thyroid. Maybe Hashimotos disease. Is your hair thinning? any pain or swelling in the throat? You know your own body and if the tests showed nothing in the heart than you don't need a Cardiologist. Have you seen an Endocrinologist? Don't stop searching for an answer. Autoimmune diseases are becoming increasingly common in women. It took years for them to diagnose me with Scleroderma. I had at one point given up also but my father pushed me to not stop and thank goodness I listened. One year after that I was diagnosed with Graves. Let me know how you are doing. I'll check the board for your reply.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your comment.\u00a0\u00a0You know, having a baby, esp. at my age, just changes everything about your body.\u00a0\u00a0It's been hard for me to know whether I was just adjusting to motherhood(exhaustion, neglect of self. poor diet,\u00a0\u00a0anxiety), or something else.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like I never can get explanations anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I went last fall for tests because I was sick like a stomach virus, but it wouldn't go away completey.\u00a0\u00a0I had no appetite,low grade fever, diarrhea, excessive gas and bloating, and fatique, but it would kinda come and go.\u00a0\u00a0I would think I was getting better, then it would get worse again.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor even said it sounded like my gallbladder, which is what I felt, but the tests all came back negative.\u00a0\u00a0I always end up feeling like I'm a hypochondriac or something, but like you said, you know when somethings not right with your body.\u00a0\u00a0This is why I'vecome here, because it seems like others have had similar problems and I'm trying to gleen some info.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again.\u00a0\u00a0I'll keep posting.",

            "answer": "I was 31 when I had my daughter and I thought all the same things about being tired, ect. But again, you know if it's not normal and to be checked now can spare serious problems down the road. Call an Endocrinologist. They diagnose thyroid and diabetic problems. My tests came back normal for a long time until finally a Dr. tried some more in depth blood tests. BINGO!!",

            "answer": "It took a year and it was actually my Gynocologist that ran the tests. All the other Dr.s dismissed my symptoms also because everything came back normal also. I too had the heart monitor, endoscopy, blood work, you name it they tested it! My gyn-ob ordered an ANA test and several others that no one else tested and there it was! A positive ANA. When I went to my PCP he was actually somewhat angry. Asking \"Why did he even do all those blood tests?\" I said \"What does it matter, he found the problem!!\" Keep me posted!!",

            "answer": "I sought a cardiologist because the heart skipping and stuff was my primary concern, and you have to have a heart, so I wanted to rule out any problems with it first,but now I wonder if it is the problem or the symptom.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes runs in my family, type II. But the symptoms I have aren't typical for it, I don't think.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know much about the thyroid problems,but my hair isn't thinning anymore, you know how you lose a ton after the baby's born.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any problems with my throateither.\u00a0\u00a0I have an appt. with my gyn. soon, so I thought I'd start there, letting them run some preliminary blood work and see what they get. How long was it before they pinned it down for you?",

I go to my gyn soon so I'll tell him about these problems.\u00a0\u00a0Even as I write, I'm recovering from a bout with diarrhea> I was sick all day yesterday with extreme bloating and gas that just made me naseaus,and I had a low fever and felt achy, which I get sometimes, with no explanation. I ate the same thing as everyone else, so I don't think it's food poisoning.\u00a0\u00a0I still suspect my gall bladder,but the tests I've had say everything is within normal limits.

    "question": "I'm a 40 yr. old female, mom of 2yr. old.I went on Prozac 6 mo. after baby was born for anxiety/depression, stayed on for about 1 yr., went off because of what I thought were side effects (sweating, weight gain, diarrhea, palpitations).I have had palpitations (by this I mean an extra beat followed by a pause and sometimes with rapid or strong heartbeat), as long as I can remember, but they've gotten alot worse during this time. I have ?'d diff.Drs. over the years about them, and had holter mon., ekg., ultrasound, 48 hr. mon., and another test (don't rem. name of), but I guess I should've asked more ?'s, 'cause no one ever explained my results just wanted to do more tests. I took it that they didn't see anything, so maybe I was just nuts.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway,I saw a cardio. a few weeks ago, and he said the test I had had looked ok, (whatever that meant,) gave me mag. suppl., and toprol, I haven't tried the toprol yet (read side effects)I've cut caffeine out of my diet and the rapid/strong beats are better, but the skip beats are no less freq. They're worse a/night when I lay down, or I notice more.Now I'm noticing that sometimes after I eat, about 30-45 mins.,I get rapid beats, feel lightheaded, confused, and then REALLY tired,and I get a headache that won't go away withmed. but sometimes gets better after next meal. I'm having anxiety but don't want to go back on med, I think it made palps. worse.If prev. test were ok, should I get new ones since symptoms are worse now? Would stenosis have shown up?Does this sound like thyroid or diabetes?What tests should I get? I see cardio 5/4/",
