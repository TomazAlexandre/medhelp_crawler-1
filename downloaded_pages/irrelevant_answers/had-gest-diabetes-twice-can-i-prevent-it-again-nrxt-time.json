            "answer": "Hi-I don't have an answer for you, but I wanted to ask if you would please post here whatever you find out on this subject? I had gest diabetes with my last baby, now I'm ten weeks and I really don't want to go through that again. It was a loooong pregnancy, and my son weighed over 9lbs, and had to be poked numerous times to test his blood sugar...Is it possible to prevent it? That had never crossed my mind until I read your post, I just accepted the fact that I would more than likely have it again.Please let me know anything you find out, and I will ask my Dr. and others and let you know too.April",

            "answer": "hi nice to meet other moms who have had GD !!\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I am getting some positive information on Preventing Gestational Diabetes.I encourage you to go to Plus-size-pregnancy.org and look up the main index.\u00a0\u00a0On the main index page, it has a link called \"All about Gestational Diabetes\"\u00a0\u00a0I was so excited when I found it. This mom that wrote it had GD in one pregnancy and went on to have 3 more pregnancies without GD,\u00a0\u00a0she has done HUGE amounts of research and posted it there along with what she did to prevent it.\u00a0\u00a0But I think she started BEFORE pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Don't give up though.\u00a0\u00a0The main keys are according to her are a diet change, exersise, and not gaining too much weight??\u00a0\u00a0Anyway I would just encourage you to look it upI also found a study done on preventing gest. Diab. I am not sure of the link.\u00a0\u00a0BUt if you click on \"fiber prevents gestational diabetes\"\u00a0\u00a0in your search web box you should find it pretty easy.I am realizing that even though I may change my lifesylye and habits completely to prevent GD it still could possibly come back, but we are a higher risk for Diabetes type 2 later in life, so the diet and exersise will defently help that in the long run.Have a great day!!",

            "answer": "i dont think its possible to prevent, sometimes its just hereditary and there are other factors like age, weight and if its a multiple pregnancy that influence your chances of getting it.It may help to watch your weight gain, but again, i dont know if thats going to guarantee anything. I have a cousin who weighs 115 at the most and she had it with all three of her pregnancies...",
