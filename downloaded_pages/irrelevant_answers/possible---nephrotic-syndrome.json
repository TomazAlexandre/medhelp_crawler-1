            "answer": "Hi,Are the results found at the bottom of the post your spinal scan results?The results of your 24 hour urine sample collection is elevated. With this, one has to check for the presence of hematuria or red blood cells in the urine, your blood pressure and total cholesterol levels. Nephrotic syndrome is a primary differential here. Was your kidney function assessed ( BUN and creatinine levels determined?).With the back pain, several differentials also need to be ruled out. This includes musculoskeletal pain, arthritc pain and an underlying spinal cord condition. Chronic pain conditions like fibromyalgia should also be considered.At this point, I do not think the proteinuria causes the back pain. However, I feel that the focus of management should be on the proteinuria first as this needs close monitoringAn abdominal CT scan may help rule out any gastrointestinal problems that may cause the back pain. Also, an underlying urinary tract infection should be ruled out.Any bacteria in the urine based on your urinalysis ?",

            "answer": "I did go to the urologist last week. He told me that I didn't have any blood in my urine so therefore, I need to see a kidney doctor. He told me that my primary should not have sent me to him unless their were finding with blood in my urine. He did check me for a urninary tract infection and the test was negative.I do have Fibromyalgia and have had it for several years. It was just that this pain was a new type of pain and if felt as if it were some sort of attack. I am feeling much better at this time, thank God.I will make an appointment with a kidney specialist and keep you all updated.Thank you for taking the time to answer my post.Tomorrow",

    "question": "Hello Everyone,I am a 43 year old woman. I have many problems with my health as you can see in my signature. My latest problem is severe lower back pain. I have had protein in my urine since 2004. I only recently found out that it has been that long that I have been leaking protein in my urine. About seven months ago, my primary doctor put me on a Ace-Inhibitor med called Lisinopril to see if this would stop the protein leakage. Unfortunately it did not work and he ordered a 24 hr. urine test. The results are as follows:Protein, Total,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Urine Reference IntervalFlag 21.4 H mg/dL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 0.0 - 15.0Flag 192.6 H mg/24 hr\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a030.0 - 150.0My primary doctor is know referring me to an Urologist. He thinks that I may have Nephrotic Syndrome. He did take the time to explain this syndrome to me in detail. I do know that my biological father died of kidney disease but never met him and don't know what type of kidney problems he had.As of the past 5 days I have been in severe back pain. The problem is I live with back pain every day for many years. I assumed that my back has gotten worse when the severe pain started. Now, I am not so sure that this increase in back pain could be from my kidneys. I also have much pain in stomach and lower back, almost as if I have a UTI once again. I have many UTI's since the age of 16. I kept contemplating going to the emergency room this morning as I had much trouble walking. The pain has eased just a little so I haven't gone yet. I am still not sure what may happen tonight.I also had a Renal Ultra Sound and the results came back normal. Oh, and my type 2 diabetes is under control and has been for quite some time. My latest A1C was 5.4.My question is if anyone on this board can relate to my problems and pain. And also if anyone has any insight on my test results. I'm not sure if these results are considered very high or not. My primary doctor said they were but he does seem to over-react at times. Any help would be greatly appreciated...
