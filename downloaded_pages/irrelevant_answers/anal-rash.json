            "answer": "I have had anal itching in the past but clotrim/beta dirpop was always my silver bullet, with just one application it would go awayI have always had sweating my anal area not sure if that is the reason.BUT the problem is clotrim/beta dirpop is no longer working :( The itching is severe. At night I cannot sleep or it wakes if I am sleeping, the itch so strong that I must scratch relieving while I scratch but it comes back in a few minutes, this last for couple of hours. One time I scratched so hard it bleed.\u00a0\u00a0Then during the day my anus is pain I guess because of the scratching. This is pretty much every night now the past 2 weeks.It's affecting my life seriously.I thought it had been hemorrhoid related but my gastroenterology says the hemorrhoid is minor and even had a sigmoidschope done and he said my rectum is fine.He recommends I make an appointment with a dermatologist.But I need relieve today!! I can't wait another week\u00a0\u00a0for an appointment.",
