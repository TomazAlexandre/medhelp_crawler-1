            "answer": "From what I understand it is very difficult to determine a life expectancy for someone in CHF.\u00a0\u00a0Our hearts are amazing organs that are able to compensate for many years.I do know that when my father-in-law was in CHF toward the end of his life, he was forgetful, sometimes disoriented, short of breath and fatigued.\u00a0\u00a0However, he also had a dissected aorta so it may have contributed to his symptoms.How is your mother feeling despite being more tired than usual?\u00a0\u00a0Is she still able to manage most of her daily care?",
