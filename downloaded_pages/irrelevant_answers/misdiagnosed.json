            "answer": "Hello,Yes, steroids affect blood sugar negatively and can drive blood sugar up dramatically.\u00a0\u00a09.4 gives you an average blood sugar of about 230 (vs. around 100 with an a1c of 5.3).This impact from the steroids may be short-term, or it may be permanent.\u00a0\u00a0If it is temporary, it may still take weeks to months for you body to get back to your previous normal blood sugar levels.What this means is that you may either need to be treated as a diabetic now - with levels this high you should be on both dietary, exercise and medications (and carefully monitored as your blood sugars should come down slowly when you're not taking steroids any more) or the treatment may need to be longer term.Regardless if they're short or longer term your currently high blood sugars do need to be treated as they will affect your body's ability to heal and longer term high sugars will cause other complications.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "However, if your A1c only 3 weeks ago (before the injections) was 5.3, and your current A1c is 9.4 (a1c is an average of 3 months), then your actual current blood sugars could be dangerously high - probably well over 230 average stated above, and treatment is absolutely required (maybe even temporary use of insulin).",

            "answer": "OK...you are misunderstanding this. Right after having the 13 injections, my A1c was 9.4 That was over a year agoSince having those injections, my A1c's were 5.5 (April 2013) 5.3 (August 2013) 5.3 (December 2013).As long as I'm not getting drowned in steroids, my A1c's are fine!!!How do I get this dang diagnosis reversed?? Clearly, my test results indicate that 9.4 reading was due to the testing so near having 13 injections. For the past year...I'm in the 5's",

            "answer": "Hello,yes I misunderstood the timeframe you wrote in your first post.The A1cs in the 5.0s are not diabetic.You were diabetic when you were given steroid injections, but you are not diabetic if you have not had steroids.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps the approach would be to ask the Dr to change your diagnosis to \"transient diabetes, caused by steroid injections\".Regardless, you should monitor a1c from time to time (maybe every 6 - 12 months), as you may be at a higher risk of developing diabetes in the future.Is there an actual problem with this diagnosis, in terms of work or insurance?\u00a0\u00a0IN such case the need to reverse the diagnosis is much more serious and you may have to fight to get the diagnosis revoked.",

    "question": "About a year ago, I went in for my annual checkup. I have a very bad back and neck, so I had been undergoing a strenuous series of steroid injections (13 in 3 weeks) immediately prior to my checkup. I was seeing a new doctor. Well, my HgA1c came in at 9.4This did not surprise me, given the amount of steroid injections I had in the past 3 months, but particularly the previous 3 weeks. I have been going in every 4 months, and my A1c's have been: 5.5; 5.3; 5.3....and here's the kicker: I have not changed my diet in ANY way. All of my blood panel and kidney panel workups are just fine.I totally argued with and disagreed with this doctor, but she just didn't listen to a thing I said. Everyone in the medical field knows how steroids affect blood glucose for heaven sake!!!I absolutely 100% believe I have been misdiagnosed. What can I do about it?",
