            "answer": "Kristin,Thanks very much for posting information about your experiences with gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Since you have been stabilized, are you noticing any improvements in blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0Being able to stabilize blood sugar will likely\u00a0\u00a0help you reduce recurrence of this awful complications.Here's some info from the JDRF website on how we can minimize our risks for not only gastroparesis, but also other forms of neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0You can find info about this & other diabetes issues at www.jdrf.org.===============================Lowering Your RiskThe development of neuropathy appears to be directly related to the duration of a person's diabetes and the level of blood glucose (sugar) control. Although the causes of nerve damage in diabetes are not fully known, high blood sugar is believed to be a major culprit.High glucose levels cause chemical changes in nerves, impairing their ability to transmit messages. High blood sugar also damages blood vessels that carry oxygen and nutrients to the nerves.Once neuropathy has been diagnosed, the damage cannot be reversed. The first line of defense is to bring blood sugar levels under the best possible control. A national study, the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial, has shown that improved control of blood sugar can reduce the risk of nerve damage.==============================================",
