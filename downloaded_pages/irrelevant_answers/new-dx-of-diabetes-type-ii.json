            "answer": "Are you seeing an Endocrinologist, a specialist in diabetes AND thyroid disorders? I would ask the Endo for an A1c test which provides a more reasonable view of the glucose over the past 3 months. The OGTT is an indicator but does not give a clear picture like the A1c. While there, discuss pancreas insulin production, and review your hypothyroid treatment plan. Hypothyroidism can elevate glucose levels.Your fasting level indicates the beginning of prediabetes [normal ranges are 60/70 to 99 mg/dl, prediabetes is 100 to 125 mg/dl]. You can reverse and lower your level with proper nutrition, proper body weight, and daily physical exercise. This includes cholesterol control too. Did you know that a healthy diet for someone with hypothyroidism resembles one for t2 diabetics? This would include natural foods, whole grains, fruits, and lots of vegetables and a good supply of seafood. Good luck.",
