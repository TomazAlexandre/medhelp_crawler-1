            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms the possibilities of UTI and kidney stones have been ruled out by urine tests and ultrasound. It is important to rule out any bladder infection as well. Also urethral syndrome or urethritis has to be ruled out. It is a primarily female syndrome in which women suffer from irritative bladder symptoms (urinary frequency, urgency, burning , and a hesitant or slowed urinary stream) in the absence of any objective urologic findings. In this the diagnosis can be made only by the proper collections of urine specimens from both the urethra and the bladder. These specimens will reveal the presence of white blood cells in the urethral washings, while the midstream (bladder) specimen will be free of cells.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
