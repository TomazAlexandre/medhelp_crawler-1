            "answer": "I am not a doctor, but I do know these surgeries can take a toll and recovery can take quite a bit of time.\u00a0\u00a0With type 2 diabetes you can also have healing issues.\u00a0\u00a0I have 25 stents at the age of 44 (4 heart attacks from 38-42, no more stents since 42).\u00a0\u00a0I have had my adrenals checked using a 4 times per day saliva collection that insurance is now paying for (at least mine is), and also had my thyroid checked as I found I was very low on testosterone and if you have thyroid or adrenal issue, testosterone replacement therapy may not work you.\u00a0\u00a0Adrenal fatigue - caused by stress both physical and mental - can cause general and sometimes profound fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0The same with hypothyroidism and low androgen levels.\u00a0\u00a0I would look for a good doctor of osteopath who will run these tests and see if there are any issues with either of these glands.\u00a0\u00a0Also, many open heart patients suffer down the road from a delayed depression, which can also lead to fatigue and apathy.\u00a0\u00a0While I am not a fan of SSRIs, there may sometimes be a need for this.\u00a0\u00a0 My mother-in-law had depression issues that started about 6 months post-surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The operation itself is amazing to me - that they can even do something like this is a testament to modern medicine.\u00a0\u00a0But the hit the body takes is heavy and some people have a tough time recovering from that.\u00a0\u00a0Finding the underlying system that is being affected can go a long way towards treating the issue.",
