            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Sinusitis involving the frontal and maxillary sinus can cause facial swelling that goes down with antibiotics. You need to get the X-rays of the sinuses along with probably a CT scan. If the sinuses are really filled with a lot of fluid, it would need to be drained.The swelling could also be due to water retention as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, severe anemia etc. There are chances that you have a kidney problem too\u2014say an infection that responds to antibiotics. A kidney function test and a urine examination is a must.It could be due to hypothyroidism too. An autoimmune thyroid disease can be detected by doing a microsomal antibody tests. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. The diagnosis and further tests will depend on whether the swelling is a pitting edema (causes a dent on pressure) or a non pitting edema.All these conditions can cause a change in voice too. It can be an allergic reaction to the medications.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
