            "answer": "Hi amy, I feel bad for you. I know how you feel. All my life I've gotten vomiting episodes that come out of nowhere, they don't last long, and pretty soon. I'm eating again and feeling better.I agree with kevin, you should get an endoscopy done. You should also be tested for Gastroparesis (which is a delayed emptying of the stomach). It's often spontaneous and can be associated with other medical conditions such as (even though you said you don't have it) type 1 and 2 diabetes, celiac, parkinson's disease, etc... To get tested for that, you would need to do a radioisotope gastric emptying scan. I also would get an HIV test. Not saying that you have it, but at least it would be ruled out. I hope you feel better soon!",
