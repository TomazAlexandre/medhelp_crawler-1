    "question": "Good afternoon!\u00a0\u00a0Hope everyone is having a great Monday.I had my visit this morning with the new neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0 He told me that my MRI findings would not be a surprise if I was an 80 year old woman with a history of diabetes and smoking.\u00a0\u00a0He wants to do some more testing.\u00a0\u00a0I am having a VEP and also a Carotid Doppler Study.\u00a0\u00a0He said he will start with\u00a0\u00a0non-invasive testing, but if everything comes back normal, we may have to go to more invasive testing.He also is sending me for additional blood work.\u00a0\u00a0He is checking me for sjorgens (only because there is a history in my family) and the following blood tests:\u00a0\u00a0 serum protein electrophoresis;\u00a0\u00a0 serum immunoelectrophoresis;\u00a0\u00a0tissue transglutaminase.\u00a0\u00a0Also antigliadin iga( whatever those are!)Anyway, all in all, I would say it was a positive visit.\u00a0\u00a0I am glad that he didn't just brush me off.\u00a0\u00a0It seems he will keep doing tests until we find out why my MRI is abnormal.Thanks for listening!Maureen",
