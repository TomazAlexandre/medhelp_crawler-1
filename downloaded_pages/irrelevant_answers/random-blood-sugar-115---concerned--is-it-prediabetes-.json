            "answer": "This was not a fasting blood test; you had eaten carbs about two hours and then again one hour prior to testing, so 115 is within normal parameters.\u00a0\u00a0Had you been fasting, 115 would've indicated pre-diabetes, but not in this case since you had eaten.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor should have given you an A1c test which is a non fasting test .\u00a0\u00a0It provides an average of your blood sugar over the past 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0She should do that test now in addition to a fasting test as well.",

            "answer": "thank youmy fasting blood sugar came out to be 120, surprisingly. i have pre-d. my a1c was in the normal range. maybe i need to go for another fasting sample.the excessive urination was from a UTI. it has now resolved.thanks for responding. do you have any idea why the random sample was lower than fasting? i did a random sample at home later and it was 105. fasting is high though.",

            "answer": "I'm afraid I can't answer why your fasting level was so high.\u00a0\u00a0I can say that the fasting test shows your glucose level at one moment in time.\u00a0\u00a0Your A1c tells you what your average glucose levels were over the past 3 months so since that was normal, that's a good sign.\u00a0\u00a0There are many reasons that blood sugar could be high and stress is one of them.\u00a0\u00a0Also certain medications and supplements such as niacin and steroids can raise your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not in the medical field; this is information I've learned in doing my own research.\u00a0\u00a0I was just the opposite of you; my fasting glucose was normal, but my A1c indicated pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I managed to bring my A1c down to a normal level by watching my carb intake.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could give you more information.",

            "answer": "unfortunately testing for diabetes by A1c and fasting or random test (random test gives random results) is not very good.sort of like checking a boat for leaks in dry dock.\u00a0\u00a0you need\u00a0\u00a0GTT testGlucose tolerance test to see how you react to sugar.",

    "question": "hi all,i had been peeing a lot recently and was very fatigued, so i went to see a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0i was diagnosed with insulin resistance and pcos 6 years back. so the doctor took a random blood sugar test and it was 115. she told me that it was on the borderline. nearly every credible source i looked online (mayo, cleveland clinic, govt. health websites) say that less than 140 for a random sample is normal not borderline. my RBS was taken at 8 pm. i had 3 crackers with peanut butter at 5:45 and then i did a cardio workout (20 minutes) and had 2 more crackers at about 7.if it's relevant, i have hashimoto's thyroiditis.if you could please tell me if a RBS of 115 indicates Pre diabetes or not, i'd be very grateful. i ve been pretty nervous about this. i am also trying to loose weight and get healthier. i workout 4-5 times a week currently.are there any other causes of fatigue and frequent urination? i also have a lot of dizziness, though i ve had that for 8+ years now and was diagnosed with chronic migraine vertigo.thank you very much",
