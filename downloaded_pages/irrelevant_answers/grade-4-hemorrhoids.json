    "question": "My 70 year-old mother has had severe rectal bleeding for years now due to Grade 4 hemorrhoids? Her iron level and hemoglobin levels are low (doctors concerned)She had a colon resection in 2009 and had also undergone chemotherapy (in remission).In Oct. 2011 she had a colonoscopy (2 polyps removed and biopsy came back negative).She also has a heart condition.Her surgeon advised her that she is not a candidate for hemorrhoidectomy (surgery) because of her heart condition.\u00a0\u00a0She also suggested rubber band ligation but is skeptical that it would work.I am very concerned about her, I don\u2019t know what else to do.Has anyone ever heard of removing hemorrhoids using laser ??I truly welcome any thoughts or suggestions.Thanks in advance,Patty",
