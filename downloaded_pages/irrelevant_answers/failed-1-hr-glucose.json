            "answer": "hi! i just went through this last week. i was so upset when i failed my 1 hr (but the ladies on here helped me). i did the 3 hr last weekend, and it wasn't as bad as i thought it would be. my appointment was for 8 am, so i didn't have a problem making it til then. i was very afraid that i would feel sick from the drink, since it's so much sweeter than the 1 hr drink, and the 1 hr drink made me nauseaus. as soon as i drank it, i did get jittery and slightly nauseaus, but it wasn't bad. and the feeling faded quickly. the tech was great, 2 draws from one vein in the right arm, and 2 draws from one vein in the left arm, and not a mark, bruise, anything. i watched tv and did some work while waiting. i actually wasn't too hungry, but i did get thirsty. she let me drink some water after the first hour was done.i was amazed to learn on monday that i passed! i don't know my numbers yet, cause i haven't seen my dr. (i failed the 1 hr with 146). i just ate normally the days before. i didn't want to cheat and alter my results since gestational diabetes can be dangerous.",

            "answer": "I also failed the 1 hour screening and the hospital I go to uses a more stringent cut off so a lot of false positives, b/c I passed the 3 hour test after as other women I know did too at that hospital. I thought the tests were fine though people scared me about how awful it tasted. The longer test doesn't use much more drink -- just a full bottle instead of half but just takes longer to do follow up blood tests every hour -- they pricked my finger so not even a big deal. I was confused too about how to prepare for the 3 hour test and worried about it but what I was told to do and people on this forum seemed to agree before was to fast from 10 pm night before your test, but for about 3 days beforehand follow generally a normal\u00a0\u00a0eating plan (if you eat fairly well with dairy, fruit, veggies, etc) but add in some extra carbs too to get at least 3 to 4 servings of each area per day for 3 days. Also, if you fail the 3 hour usually gestational diabetes can be controlled with eating better such as getting help from a nutritionist, though some women have to take medication. I was mad b/c I already was eating fairly healthy and exercising daily to prevent gestational diabetes as diabetes runs in my family and I was overweight to start with so didn't know what else I might do to control it other than medicine, but fortunately I passed the 3 hour test. Good luck!",
