            "answer": "Uh oh lol...normally I'd say not to worry but do you know the sodium content of those? Maybe limit yourself to once a week since they're your favorite, and try to find other foods that are healthier that you enjoy just as much. Diet and nutrition are pretty important in pregnancy, and too much salt could lead to high blood pressure, which is a very serious complication in pregnancy. Eating those sorts of foods regularly could also mean that your baby's not getting enough of the nutritious stuff, and possibly gestational diabetes down the line. In the first trimester the baby's nutritional needs aren't huge, but still, it's a good idea to wean yourself from these habits now.",
