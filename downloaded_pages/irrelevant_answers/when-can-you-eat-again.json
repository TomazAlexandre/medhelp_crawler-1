            "answer": "The correct time to test blood sugar is two hours after eating, not one hour. There are no rules about when you can eat, though if you were high you wouldn't want to eat anything with carbs that would further raise your blood sugar.(Low carb snacks would include things like nuts, vegies, cheese or cold cuts) If you are hungry and eating an hour after a meal this is definitely a setup for weight gain! I'm wondering if you are getting enough nutrition in your meals as an adult shouldn't be hungry that often. You might want to work with a dietician or do some research online so that you have a diet that is appealing, satisfying, and nutritional while not being bad on your blood sugar.",

            "answer": "With diabetes there are no hard and fast rules such as when (or even what) you eat. But if you want to control your blood sugar, you probably wouldn't want to eat with a blood sugar of 145 because it has nowhere to go but up, unless you ate something with 0 carbs. I would consult your doctor or a dietician if you are having trouble keeping your blood sugar from going too low and if you are always hungry.",
