            "answer": "Hi, I am 37 and was dx with stage 1a ovarian cancer last July.\u00a0\u00a0I also had pain like you are describing but think it was related to endometriosis and not the cancer.\u00a0\u00a0 I didn't know I had endometriosis until my ovarian cancer surgery. My symptoms related to the cancer were urinary urgency and frequency.\u00a0\u00a0I also had abdominal pain that wasn't related to my cycle.\u00a0\u00a0After a c-section you can also develop adhesions that can cause pain.\u00a0\u00a0A transvaginal ultrasound is a great way to put your mind at ease if your pain persists.\u00a0\u00a0It would be able to identify any cysts on your ovaries.\u00a0\u00a0It is scary to have pains and not know the answers but the odds are with you that it won't be ovarian cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Still..trust your gut and follow-up with your dr.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "I'm 35 years old- I have 1 child- had a c-sec 2 years ago. During pregnacy developed Gestational Diabetes- still taking meds for hugh blood sugar. Prior to pregnacy had normal menstral cycle. Occasional pain on one side mid cycle. Since giving birth my cycle hasn't been quite as regular- but still fairly consistant. Recently I've gone as long as 40 days between periods. They seem normal, not alot of pain- nothing that 1 motrin can't fix- some clotting but I wouldn't classify as heavy bleeding. My problem is mid way I will have pain on one side. The right side has been worse than the left. The pain can last from a few days to over a week (right side). The pain can be debilitating at times- usually requiring many motrin and even then I am still feeling it. My doctor thinks it's mittersmertz (sorry if I spelled that wrong) When I lay in bed for an extended period of time- such as an 8 hour night of sleep- I have low back pain. I can't determine if that is related though- this is something that is consistant and doesn't vary with my cycle. I have recently started burping a lot-but only at night. I know it sounds crazy that I would worry about something like that- I take Metformin 500 mcg 2 times a day and byetta 10 mcg 2 times a day. Both of these drugs can cause gasto troubles. So- Is this something to really worry about? If this was a cancer type situation would the pain be constant? Incidently- when the pains are very severe- it radiates to the thigh on the side that hurts. Any input would be greatly appreciated. After my c-sec, my doctor didn't seem like there could be any types of issues so I would assume that all was well. I don't how much is looked at during childbirth. When I talked to her about this she didn't seem concerned. I am though- being the mother of a young child- I need to take care of myself. Thanks so much in advance.",
