            "answer": "from what i'm learning, progesterone is a natural diuretic and in early pregnancy causes many trips to the bathroom b/c of this. Also, in early pregnancy, estrogen soars to an all time high, causing tender breasts. progesterone is also known to cause stuffy nose and headaches. I'm currently using progesterone cream (not pregnant) and the cream has amazing benefits but also causes headache, stuffy nose and frequent urination. So, if you suddenly have these symptoms, its very likely that you could be pregnant!",
