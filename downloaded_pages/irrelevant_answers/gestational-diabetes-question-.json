Only a couple times it was a little higher but I thought mine wasn't bad and I'm 36 weeks and my baby is healthy and not big at all he's gaining weight perfectly. But you seem like you definitely don't have it. My mom's friend is a dietian and he said I don't have it my number wasn't that high at all. I still check my blood of course just to make sure everything is fine with my baby. But I would talk to your Dr about that.",

I'm a grazer and would like to eat every hour!\u00a0\u00a0Lol",

            "answer": "My glucose level was high for my 1 hour test so they sent me for the 3 hour. They only got my fasting blood sugar that time because they gave me the drink and 20 mins later I threw up. It made me so sick. My fasting was 76 and they told me that between 65-99 was normal. My dr also told me that if my blood sugar was high for only 1 of the hours they usually don't diagnose you, just reccomend diet changes. I go back to see her tomorrow for the first time since I tried to do the 3 hour test so I'm not sure what theyre going to do.",

Guess I will find out!",

            "answer": "To be completely honest I hate pricking my finger 4 times a day and have trouble eating the amt of carbs the dietitian said I should so I kinda just eat what I can and my levels are within range...but that doesn't mean I'm going to second guess my doctor. She's my doctor for a reason. Glucose levels tend to get worse the further along you are which is why if it is high for the 1 hour then 2 or 3 hour they make you watch your glucose levels for the rest of the pregnancy. Is it a pain in the a** yes....however it is something that I can manage for the next 10 weeks to make sure my baby is healthy and can manage their insulin once she is born.",

    "question": "Has anyone on here been diagnosed with gestational diabetes but feel that it was wrongly diagnosed?\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with it nearly two weeks ago because my fasting blood sugar was 94 during my two hour glucose test and the one at one hour and the one at two hours were both fine and normal.\u00a0\u00a0Since then I've been having to poke my fingers four times a day to test and record my blood sugar... All of which have been where they want them to be.\u00a0\u00a0Just feeling it's unnecessary.\u00a0\u00a0Obviously I'll do whatever is best for my baby, just seems like they jumped the gun!\u00a0\u00a0I'll be 30 weeks this Thursday 1/29/15. Have a doc appt on Wednesday so will be talking to doc,\u00a0\u00a0just thought I'd ask here too :)",
