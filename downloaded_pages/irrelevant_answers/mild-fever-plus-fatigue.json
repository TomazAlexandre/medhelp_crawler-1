            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Mild fever with extreme fatigue may be seen in anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis. In women, even polycystic ovary, hormonal imbalance, PID (pelvic inflammatory disease) should be investigated for. Dehydration is a frequent cause of low grade fever with malaise. So drink plenty of fluids and see. It can also be a viral flu. Drink plenty of warm fluids, take OTC medicine for fever and see if it helps. Please consult your doctor. Take care!",
