            "answer": "Hi,What is the unit for your microalbumin level ? Is this .2 g or 200 mg ?What is the unit for your creatinine level , is this in mg/dl?I would assume that this is quantitative urine microalbumin level and not blood levels.If this is the first time that these tests were done? You may need to be closely followed up by your physician.The microalbumin levels and creatinine levels may be repeated a few times in the next three months.It is also necessary to determine serum BUN levels , serum electrolyte levels, a complete blood count, and an ultrasound of the kidneys. Fasting blood sugar should also be determined.Your gomerular filtration rate should be computed for baseline reference.How old are you?Do your have any underlying diabetes or hypertension?Do you have any symptoms which warrant the perfomance of these tests?",

            "answer": "Hi,Your creatinine level is elevated and with your current prediabetic state, this requires close follow up in the next 3 months. Your protein to creatinine ratio is also elevated which suggests that you are passing high amounts of protein in your urine. This needs further evaluation and there should be a more aggressive approach in monitoring your prediabetic state.Your serum BUN level is also essential. The presence of microalbuminuria also suggests that you may need to have this closely watched and followed up in the next 2-3 months. Your blood sugar levels also need to be controlled. Dietary modification and an exercise regimen need to be met.You may need a referral to an endocrinologist for your prediabetic state as well as close supervision by a nephrologist is indicated.",

            "answer": "Hi,I apologize for this misunderstanding. The reason why I have asked for the units of measurements involved is to avoid situations like this. Firstly, with regards to the creatinine. You have posted a creatinine level of 55 mg/dl. Given that this is in mg/dl , blood creatinine levels are expressed in mg/dl. Blood crea levels have a normal range given below.If we use this to assess your crea levels (at 55) , this will appear highly elevated. But urine creatinine levels will show acceptable values which is\u00a0\u00a0normal at greater than 20 mg/dl.Blood creatinine levels:\uf0a7\tAdult men: 0.6 to 1.3 mg/dl\uf0a7\tAdult women: slightly lower than men due to less muscle mass\uf0a7\tChildren: 0.2 to 1.0 mg/dlSource: http://www.chfpatients.com/tests/routine_tests.htm#creatininehttp://www.bloodbook.com/ranges.htmlUrine Crea levels:Consistent with normal human urine(If the creatinine value is greater than 20mg/dL.)Source: http://sdrl.com/tech_briefs/UrineCreatinine.html2.With regards to the microalbumin values,you have posted 0.2 mg/dl.Apparently mg/dl is not the unit of measure here. It is micrograms per mg creatinine:Category Spot collection ( microgms/mg creatinine)Normal\u00a0\u00a0300Source: http://courses.washington.edu/hubio562/urinaly/proteinuria.htmlThis I would say was another misunderstanding. I apologize.3.As with , the albumin and creatinine ratio,the units of measures here will vary with\u00a0\u00a0the normal range of reference values .Creatinine may be expressed in gram and mmol. Given that the creatinine is in mmol ,albumin and creatinine ratio of greater than 2-3 may actually need further evaluation.\u201cIt is noteworthy that the currently quoted adult reference range for ACRs in the non-pregnant population is up to 3.4mg of albumin/mmol creatinine \u2026.\u201dSource: http://www.clinsci.org/cs/104/0103/cs1040103.htm\u201cIn a non-pregnant diabetic population, an early morning urine (EMU) specimen with an (micro)albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR) of >3mg/mmol reliably predicts an overnight excretion of 300\u00b5g/min. If such a ratio is greater than 1mg/mmol, then it is mandatory to collect a 24-h sample of urine to quantify the albuminuria \u2026.\u201dSource: http://www.clinsci.org/cs/104/0103/cs1040103.htmGiven that the creatinine is expressed in grams,interpretation of Urine Albumin to Creatinine Ratio presents as:Normal Ratio (in general <30 mg/g is normal)Men: < 0.017 (or 17 mg albumin to 1 gram Creatinine)Women: <0.025 (or 25 mg albumin to 1 gram Creatinine)This shows that your urine albumin to crea ratio is within normal.The reason why I posted increased protein excretion in the urine is that you have mentioned that creatinine is in mg/dl and your albumin also in mg/dl, given this, blood protein to creatinine ratio shows that \u201ca ratio of 2.5 suggests the presence of nephrotic range proteinuria. Therefore the urine protein-to creatinine ratio is used to estimate the degree of proteinuria.\u201dSource:http://courses.washington.edu/hubio562/urinaly/proteinuria.htmlI apologize for this misunderstanding. It is essential to indicate the correct units of measurements as laboratory values do vary in some cases between laboratories. Especially for examinations not done routinely, this may lead to misunderstandings. It is good to know that everything is normal and thank you for pointing this out.",
