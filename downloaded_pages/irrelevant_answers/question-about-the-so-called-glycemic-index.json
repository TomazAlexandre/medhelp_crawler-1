            "answer": "The GI issues reports on foods with carbs.\u00a0\u00a0High GI are carbs, usually simple sugars, that break down quickly and raise blood sugar levels quickly and sustain that increase for a period of time. Low GI carbs, usually complex carbs, don't raise blood sugar levels for a significant period of time.\u00a0\u00a0A sustained blood sugar level over 130 is considered to be a pre-diabetic state and indicates a raised risk of type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Although being overweight or obese is considered a risk factor to diabetes, being thinner doesn't preclude one from getting type II diabetes. Packaged breakfast cereals are pretty much all considered to be high glycemic foods, although those made from oats, like oatmeal are lower on the GI.\u00a0\u00a0If you are worried about being in a risk zone for diabetes, ask your doctor about a blood test to measure your \"3 month\" glycemic average, which will give you your risk factor for diabetes. I can't think of the name of the test right now, but I will look it up and post it later.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Well, I realize it's not as extensive as what you're talking about, but I had a basic metabolic panel a few months ago which came back perfectly normal. And I don't have a familial predisposition toward diabetes or obesity (which is supposedly found in something like 85% of cases of type 2 diabetes).I just thought it was a bit strange that people were pointing fingers at something as seemingly innocent as Cheerios.",

            "answer": "If you like Cheerios, I say go for it. Many millions of people have been eating that cereal all their lives without problems.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt that it alone will give anyone diabetes or anything else.\u00a0\u00a0You asked about the GI, and that is what it does, rate risk for diabetes. The information the GI relates is good, but it is often presented by the media in such a way to either scare or guilt people into watching their weight.\u00a0\u00a0You have neither a weight or diabetic problem, so enjoy your breakfast as you choose.",

            "answer": "If your fasting blood sugar was 99 or less on your BMP, you have no family history of DM, and you are not overweight/obese, then you are at an extremely low risk for developing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you consume a high carb diet and eat foods with a high GI.GI is actually something that we don't use a whole lot, clinically, because carb counting (combined with exercise and, if need be, medications) is typically the most effective dietary strategy towards managing blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, carb counting is combined with GI if someone is really having a difficult time managing their blood sugar.These are the classifications of normal/prediabetes/diabetes according to the American Diabetes Association:Fasting Blood sugar level of:99 and below-Normal100 to 125-Pre-diabetes (impaired fasting glucose)126 and above Diabetes*if blood sugar is high the first test, the test is repeated for reproducibility and then the diagnosis can be made.one can also do an oral glucose tolerance test for a diagnosis of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Hemoglobin A1c (the 3 month weighted average of blood sugar) is not a diagnostic criteria for diabetes but it does tell you your risk factor.",

    "question": "I'm a thin (I'm actually trying to gain weight), 20-year-old male, relatively healthy and certainly not at high risk for diabetes. I also have a pretty good diet, though like with most people, there is room for improvement.My question is this: For the past 6 months or so, I've been eating a large bowl of Cheerios with breakfast almost every morning, usually accompanied by some granola or mixed nuts and orange juice. I had always assumed that eating Cheerios was beneficial to my diet, certainly not harmful in any way. Last night, however, I read something online about the \"glycemic index,\" which implicated Cheerios as being on the high-end due to their carbohydrate density. According to these reports, a high GI diet is supposedly linked to diabetes.So I guess I'm wondering, should I be concerned that this is going to cause me harm somehow, or am I overreacting?",
