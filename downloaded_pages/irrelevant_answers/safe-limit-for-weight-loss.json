            "answer": "I think you should go to the doctor. If you haven't changed anything and your losing weight followed with your appetite your body is telling you something. I just don't know what. Even if you not underweight you shouldn't be losing that much weight so quickly. Go to the doctors and get some answers.Good luck and let us know.",

    "question": "Hi, For the past two years I have been at a constant weight of around 88kg. This never changed no matter how much i would exercise or how well i ate, (however I did eat a bit too much) recently over the past two months I have dropped down to 76kg. This is with no change in my diet, and I am excercising no more than i used too. I did not think much of it at first, but now, over the past two weeks I have started losing my appetite, I never feel a real urge to eat like I used to, and find it hard to eat normal portions without feeling full. Im just wondering if this is normal or could there be something wrong? I am not depressed or stressed, Also just wondering if the amount of weight I lost in that time is normal/ok/safe? Should I go see a doctor? Thankyou, Tim.",
