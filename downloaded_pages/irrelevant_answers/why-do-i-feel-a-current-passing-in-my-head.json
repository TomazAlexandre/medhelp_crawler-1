It can also be due to fibromyalgia, can be due Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. Any problem in the ear too can cause this feeling.There are many causes of ear pain. These include: impacted wax, swimmer\u2019s ear, middle ear infection, fungal infection of outer canal, boil in outer canal, pinched nerve, benign intracranial hypertension, blocked Eustachian tube as seen in cold and sinusitis etc. TMJ, sore throat and tooth ache can cause referred pain to ear. Mastoiditis is also a possibility. It is difficult to diagnose on net. Please consult an ENT specialist. Take care!",
