            "answer": "I would advise you to see an endocrinologist. You may be beyond supplements and need hormone replacements. The thirst/pee cycle is indicative of diabetes insipidus (water diabetes) and needs to be controlled. Keep drinking.My best guess is that you have a possible/probably pituitary issue, and sadly, nothing OTC - and no adrenal support supplement is going to help - it will just muddy up the testing. DHEA converts to testosterone and estrogen. As you did not get those tested, and your cortisol was normal with a normal rhythm, my worry would be the DI and you need to see a doctor.",

            "answer": "Hi Rumpled. First would like to say thank you for taking time out of your day to give me advice!I have been seeing 2 different Endochronologists for over four years. I also work at a Hospital so have great healthcare. Unfortunately my Endochronolgist doesn't take the time with me.It's funny you suggest possible diabetes insipidus. After 5 yrs pleading to my family doctor and endochronologist it was my GYN/OBGYN who actually suggested that I get tested for it. I requested the test from my doctor and had the ADH blood test done Friday. I still haven't received the results. They sent it off. I am very anxious to see what the results are.Thanks again!!!!",

            "answer": "Yeah... most endos I call endoduds... that is why it takes so long to get diagnosed for most of us.I had several surgeries to remove cysts and etc etc etc before I had the total hyst - so there are lots and lots of options to retain much and stay fertile so discuss that with your doc. I was just in tons of pain and was not fertile anyway - so the hyst was my best option.",
