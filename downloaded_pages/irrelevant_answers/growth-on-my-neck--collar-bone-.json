It can be persisting due to diabetes, eczema, dermatitis, infection or even due to cancer (actually do not want to scare you but it is better to be conscious about such possibilities). Take care!",

    "question": "i have this growth on my throat in the front in between my collar bone. about two months ago it appeared as if it was a skin tag - but slightly irritated. i tried to remove it and it became infected, it turned red all around the skin, kind of hardened and formed a puss head. i popped it and it eventually went away but the scar stayed. a couple of days ago it started to form another head. im wondering if this sounds like staff infection, or maybe a tumor? or maybe just a badly infected skin tag. as of now it is annoyingly irritated and red all around, it is also slightly hard. please advise",
