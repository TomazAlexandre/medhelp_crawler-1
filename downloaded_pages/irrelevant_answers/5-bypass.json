            "answer": "It sounds like you had wonderful medical care.Depression after what you have gone through is not unusual, but frankly expected.\u00a0\u00a0I've experienced what you have gone through.\u00a0\u00a0I'm currently going through a 'second round' of heart rehabilitation after heart bypass surgery.Hopefully, your hospital has a heart rehab program in place, and the nurses are trained to deal with your recovery and work with the depression that follows after\u00a0\u00a0what you have experienced.I'm just a heart recovery meatball, I'm not a professional, but as a diabetic, I suggest you lose weight if you need to, control your diabetes, change your diet if you need to eliminate red meat, exercise, and certainly, participate in the rehab program of your hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Try not to listen to all the friends and family with ideas of 'natural' nostrums to cure you, in almost all cases they haven't walked the walk that you and I have walked.I had my first heart event at your age, and I'm still standing at almost 72 years old.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in touch.",

            "answer": "Hi there,You went through a traumatic time and glad to hear that you are okay now.\u00a0\u00a0Depression sets in post-op.\u00a0\u00a0There is even a term for it:\u00a0\u00a0pump head syndrome/depression.\u00a0\u00a0When they operate on your heart, they flat-line your brain for the time that you are on the bypass-pump and that scrambles your chemical balances in your brain.\u00a0\u00a0And having such a big operation is also a shock to the system and buggers up your Cortisol levels, that also brings on depression.I was 31 when I had my OHS and I am now 5 years post-op and still battling with depression sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have the luxury of cardio rehab, had a 5 and 2 year old at home that I needed to take care of and little to no help from family and friends.Don't feel alone in this and speak to your Doctor and get some anti-depressants and even counselling if you feel it will help.All the best and we're here for you.",
