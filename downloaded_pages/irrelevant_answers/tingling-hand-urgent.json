            "answer": "Hello,This feeling of tingling that you are having are called Paresthesia.It indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency, or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due tocarpal tunnel syndrome.Nerve conduction tests are required to confirm the diagnosis.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
