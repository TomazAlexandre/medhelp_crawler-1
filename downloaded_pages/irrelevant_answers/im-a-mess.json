            "answer": "Hi,It looks like the Janumet is doing some good already, and you are following a diet plan that will also help a great deal.\u00a0\u00a0Given that your glucose readings are still so high, I think you will likely need some additional treatment to help bring your levels down into a better range. It may not be permanent--once you are able to lose some weight, you may not need as much medication to keep your glucoses down. Give your doctor a call and ask about adding another medication, and keep on with the diet. Be sure to add exercise gradually as well, with your goal being 30 minutes a day.You are doing a good job so far.take care.",
