The real questions are:\u00a0\u00a0Is he urinating often, and more volume than you might expect?\u00a0\u00a0Is he very thirsty? If the answer to either of these is yes, make sure the doctor tests him, preferably with a better test than a 'spot' blood glucose.\u00a0\u00a0And if he isn't diabetic, then ask if the doctor thinks there is any problem causing him to weigh less than expected.",
