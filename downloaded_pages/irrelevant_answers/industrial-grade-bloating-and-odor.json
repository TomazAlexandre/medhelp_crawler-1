            "answer": "Dear Amalgam,I can understand your concern.Abdominal bloating and flatulence can arise due to:1) Lactose intolerence \u2013 One\u2019s ability to digest milk goes down as one ages and an undigested milk sugar, lactose gets fermented in colon to produce flatulence. This is the commonest cause of abdominal bloating and a trial of a milk free diet for 2 weeks may help to confirm it.2) Conditions which cause intestinal dysmotility (abnormal movement of the intestines) and secondary bacterial overgrowth like hypothyroidism, diabetes mellitus and diverticulosis. This leads to malabsorption of sugars and proteins which are then fermented in the colon to produces \"gas\". Doing a thyroid profile and a sugar profile will help rule out these conditions.3) Intestinal disorders like celiac disease and Crohn's disease which lead to malabsorption. These are associated with significant weight loss and other symptoms like loose stool or diarrhoea.Please do not hesitate in consulting and explaining your problems to your doctor.

    "question": "This is a very embarrassing question to ask but here we go. I am 52 male with healthy eating habits but with a terrible case of bloating. I am talking about passing gas at least 20 times per hour, and in 95% of the cases the odor that comes along with the gas is unbearable. The disgusting odor sometimes smells like some type of epoxy or chemical, some times like rotten egg, but in every case it can be smelled even if I am outdoors in a windy day. Is there anything that I can do, and if I need medical attention how can I tackle this embarrassing situation in medical terms without using such disgusting wording.Thank you so much",
