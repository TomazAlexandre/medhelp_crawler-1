            "answer": "Might be a sugar problem, Hypo (or) Hyper-glycemia can do it.It caused me to have some of those symptoms (are you thirsty alot?) if you are overweight, eat sugar often or even if you are thin and live on a lean diet, you can still have glucose/sugar problems. You can have a sugar problem and not have diabetes too. There is a thing called borderline and thats a great time to become aware and learn how to take care of yourself so you won't GET diabetes. As far as being pregnant again... thats easy enough to check with an at home test. Most of them are so sensitive now you don't even have to be late much (if at all) for them to work.There are so many different things that present with these symptoms, I would take a pregnancy test and if you are not pregnant, try getting someone to take your sugar count with a blood glucose meter. You can buy a complete glucose test kit with test strips & lancets for around 20- 30 dollars at Wal-mart if no one you know has one. It is simple to do, just follow the directions. You may need to take it a few times a day, especially when you feel symptoms of dizziness & fatigue. If the number is very high or very low a few hours after eating, you need to see a doctor for further testing. (look up normal blood sugar counts on the internet if you need to). If your sugar count is completely normal, go to a doctor as soon as you can if you don't feel better since those kind of symptoms should really be checked out. You may need your blood drawn to see if you are dealing with an infection. Good luck and I hope you feel better.",

            "answer": "Hello,First of all what about your periods.After birth of a child menstrual cycles can return as early as 1 month and as late as 9 months.But more important is ovulation.Even if you are breast feeding your child,then also unprotected intercourse can lead to pregnancy as ovulation may be restored early.Secondly these symptom scan be due to anemia also.In my opinion,you should get a urine for pregnancy test done or a serum HCG test done to confirm your pregnancy status.Then if found negative,you can take iron supplements and mutivitamins for some days.also eat a healthy nutritious diet and take proper rest and sleep.If still the symptoms persist then pls get yourself evaluated from a physician.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",
