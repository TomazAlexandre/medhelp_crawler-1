            "answer": "As I told MERCYFrequent thirst and urination are classic symptoms. Now I am not sure if you are talking about it hurts when she Pee's. If it is when she pee's and she does have high blood sugars then she could have a bladder, urinary tract, or yeast infection. These are always more common when a person's blood sugar is high.My uncle is a eye doctor and he said that although you can tell when someone is sick sometimes with an eye exam it is not a definitive treatment or diagnosis. Unless it is a problem with the eye.My advice would be to call your Family doctor and make an appt because the not knowing is going to be difficult so make an appt and find out what is going on so that your daughter can feel better ASAP!Pumpgirl03",

But the urinating all of the time and the not going very much is definitely a symptom. And the thirst is also a classic symptom. When I was working in the hospital in diabetes education in my town we did have a boy who was over-weight and was diagnosed with childhood onset type 2 diabetes and he had gained some weight because his body was producing so much insulin to compensate for his bigger body size that it caused him to gain weight. I would talk to my doctor as soon as possible. It is better to be safe than sorry in your situation. And just because he doesn't fit the classic mold doesn't mean diabetes should be deleted as a possibility.But talk to your doctor that would be the best thing to do.Pumpgirl03",

And Type II is very common on my mothers side.I also have been drinking very heavy for the past six months.Is it possible that I have been borderline Type I for years and now maybe my pancreas has given out totally because it has had to work double time to metabolize all the sugar in the alcohol.",

            "answer": "Yes, you may well have suggested exactly what has been going on. The tiredness over a long period of time could easily have been a symptom of hypoglycemia or diabetes, either of which would be made worse by the sugar in the alcohol. I would recommend a blood test ASAP. The passing out is of course dangerous, whether it be from low or high blood sugar. At this point, a glucose tolerance test should be done if a fasting blood sugar does not show diabetes. Frequently, hypoglycemics turn into type 2 diabetics as their pancreases continue to work overtime. A change in lifestyle right now might save you or at least slow down the process. If you have developed diabetes (your family history suggests this is possible), you need immediate medication in order to prevent worse damage. I would RUN, not walk, to my doctor and have a fasting blood sugar done. If the results are high, you can be put on medication. If low or normal, I would absolutely insist on a glucose tolerance test in order to discover whether the faintness is due to hypoglycemia. If driving a vehicle when dizzy, you could easily kill yourself or others. Both conditions are easily treatable, but not knowing is certainly dangerous.",
