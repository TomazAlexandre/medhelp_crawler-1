            "answer": "Hi,This does appear to be ocular migraine without the headache. Migraine can be triggered by stress, hunger, red wine, processed meats and cheese, chocolates, monosodium glutamate and even sun exposure.Have you been able to identify any trigger for your migraine? The best treatment for migraine is identification and avoidance of trigger.Biofeedback and magnesium supplements are also helpful in patients with a chronic and intractable migraine.",

            "answer": "Hi,The causes of foggy vision include cataract, glaucoma, diabetes, macular degeneration, short sightedness or near sightedness, retinopathy and ocular migraine.I would suggest you to seek a second opinion with a neurologist as the treatment would depend on the exact cause. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 30 years old and for about three months I have had what I would describe as foggy vision (similar to looking through static on a television) consistently 24 hrs a day.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, my eyes are very sensitive to light, are extremely blood shot and dry, my left ear has been ringing and I have been getting fairly regular ocular migranes. I have been getting these ocular migraines since I was young (about 10 yrs old) but they have been occurring with much more regularity over the past three months since I have had this permanent visual disturbance and ringing of the ear.\u00a0\u00a0I have met with multiple ophthalmologists who say with my contacts I see 20/20 and my eyes are fine.\u00a0\u00a0I have met with one neurologist on multiple occasions and had an EEG, MRI of the brain, CT scan of what I believe was the arteries leading to the brain and several blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0So far everything has tested fine without any indication of a problem.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist said it sounded like some sort of permanent migraine and prescribed a six day cycle of Methylprednisolone which did not help the visual symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0He has prescribed Topamax to prevent the ocular migraines which has helped prevent the frequency of the ocular migraines but has done nothing for the constant visual disturbances.\u00a0\u00a0Beyond that my current neurologist does not know what to try.\u00a0\u00a0Are you familiar of an effective treatment for similar symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0I have not been tested for Lyme disease, but I am really not sure the probability of that being the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Any advise would be appreciated.Thanks-jryanp",
