            "answer": "Mg is Magnesium, the ninth most abundant element in the Universe,involved in over 300 bodily functions and processes.Mg Deficiencies are unfortunately under-looked by most doctors, and yet70-80% of N.American people are deficient.Blood tests do not indicate this as there's a mechanism that controlsthe Mg levels in the blood to approx.1%. Tissue analysis for mineralswill show any deficiencies.Check online \"The Miracle of Magnesium\", by Dr. Carolyn Dean.D3 is the most efficient form of vitamin D, a very important vitamin and hormone as well, vital for good general health and calcium absorption.To test for this you need a test is called 25(OH)D.The guidelines are too low (50 nmol/l) and should be increased to 80 nmol/laccording to recent studies.Its deficiency can result in Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes, High Blood Pressure, Depression, Psoriasis, Fibromyalgia, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Kidney Stones, Osteoporosis, & Neuro-degenerative disease including Alzheimer\u2019s Disease.Hope this helps.CheersNiko",
