            "answer": "hi rumpled....im new to this forum but i have been diagnosed since 2001 as having had a prolactin secreting pituitary microedema.\u00a0\u00a0 In 2001 i had a hysterectomy and that stopped the enlarged breats and leeking and of course, no more periods although these had ceased prior.since 2008 i started having headaches, leading to pressure and no ache, then feeling like i was getting adrenal rushes, inabiliuty to deal with stress, panic attacks, dramatic weight loss (most symptoms since October of 2008).....i had a blood workup and it said i had an 899 cortisol reading and i am awaiting other blood work.\u00a0\u00a0 in May 2008 i was diagnosed with diabetes, and high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on meds for both.\u00a0\u00a0Only to find out i didnt have diabetes after a FU blood.\u00a0\u00a0 This is crazy.\u00a0\u00a0I almost died with this med!.\u00a0\u00a0 I have since seen a neurologist but i think his job is to tell me i had a tumour, which i already knew.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, should i not have been referred to an endo?this is a very trying period for me.\u00a0\u00a0I have started passing out, being disoriented, lightheaded,...all in a short time...any help would be great",

            "answer": "Yes, you should have been referred to a neuro-endocrinologist - one that deals with pituitary tumors.Just so you know, I had both Cushing's (high cortisol) and a prolactinoma tumors - one on the left and one of the right. I only lactated for a year (a very very painful year) and then the prolactin levels went down to normal. and then the cortisol started to rise.I know of at least 2 other people with the same two tumors.Cortisol can cycle, as mine did - and it would lead to your symptoms being all over the place. The diabetes is probably caused by the high cortisol and may pulse high. I never got diabetes but like you, they put me on metformin - it was an awful experience.The neurologist is not going to help you much. You need to find some endo that has dealt with a lot of Cushing's.",

    "question": "To those with Pit tumors or adrenal issues:I think I figured out the reason why so many of us have low Vit. D.\u00a0\u00a0It's because cholesterol is needed to make Vit. D, and cholesterol is also needed to make cortisol.\u00a0\u00a0So Vit. D suffers at the expense of the body trying to keep cortisol levels up!Add the prefix to this link (www), because otherwise it probably won't post at all:\u00a0\u00a0life-with-confidence.com/benefit-of-vitamin-d.html",
