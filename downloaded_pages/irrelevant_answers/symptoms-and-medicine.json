Vibrates? or like Fibrilation?).\u00a0\u00a0Follow with sweating and nausea (like gastric).\u00a0\u00a0After get up from bed, have 2 cups of strong coffee then feel better.\u00a0\u00a0But chest tight and pain, light-headed and dizzy and SOB will develope.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what is it could be..... I'm 50 years old.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be a perimenopause?\u00a0\u00a0Or it is the symptoms of diabetes type II?\u00a0\u00a0Or would it be anemia?\u00a0\u00a0Those symptoms happened in my sleep around 5-6 times a night.\u00a0\u00a0Normally in the early morning.\u00a0\u00a0Could someone shade a light and give me some ideas?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
