            "answer": "There are several possible side effects of this drug.The dr, knowing all of your history, would make the decision and weigh out the good vs bad. Sometimes the bad side effects are worth the risk. Sometimes they want to try other steps first. You could google the drug and see. I only know that low blood sugars are really bad effects. Best wishes.",
