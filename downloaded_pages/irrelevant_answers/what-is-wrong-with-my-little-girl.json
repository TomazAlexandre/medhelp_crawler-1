            "answer": "Wow.\u00a0\u00a0First of all, I just want to say how sorry I am that you\u00a0\u00a0and your daughter have ben through so much.\u00a0\u00a0I know how worried I get over simple stuff, so I can only imagine how worried and frustrated you are.\u00a0\u00a0I am not really sure what all the symptoms are pointing to, but some of them really jumped out at me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not trying to scare you, but being excessively tired and begging to go to bed, almost sounds like Leukemia.\u00a0\u00a0Does she ever have unexplained and odd bruising on her back?\u00a0\u00a0Has she ever had a CBC done to see what her white count is?\u00a0\u00a0If not, I would definitely get one done.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I knew someone in college who had chronic fatigue syndrome, and had it his whole life.\u00a0\u00a0He was always tired and had sleepy eyes.\u00a0\u00a0He said there was no treatment, but that was 10 yrs ago, so you never know if there is treatment now.\u00a0\u00a0Another thing that jumped out at me was the frequent urination and thirst.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The only disease I know of with those symptoms is Diabetes (I'm sure there are others, but this is what comes to my mind first).\u00a0\u00a0 I wish I knew how to help you, and my heart goes out to you.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to scare you by throwing out possible diseases without being a trained medical professional, but these are the things I would probably be thinking about if it were my child.\u00a0\u00a0You certainly don't want to subject her to unnecessary tests, but maybe these are things you can research on your own and if you think the other symptoms fit, you can ask your doctor about them.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, others in the forum can be more helpful, and I hope you will find answers somewhere.",
