    "question": "A year ago I started having pain in my left forearm. Burning and tingling that progressed to my hand and fingers. Sometimes just the pointer finger, other times the pinky finger. The pain then proceeded to my right arm and wrist. Usually just the wrist in the right hand, never the fingers. The pain was from my shoulders to my fingers on both sides. I now have lower back/pelvic pain that radiated all the way to my toes. Other symptoms include tension headaches, dizziness, numbness in hands and feet, IBS and severe exchaustion. EMG only showed minimal signs of carpel tunnel. head CT for the dizziness was clear. Corotid ultrasound was clear, and cervical spine X Ray showed a straightening of the cervical spine. The pain worsens by the day while the lower back pain worsens when I lay down and sit... I had a severe case of gestational diabetes 2 years ago and was never 're-checked after delivery. Is it possible these are signs of nerve damage from still having it?",
