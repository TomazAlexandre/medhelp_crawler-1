            "answer": "Have you gone to a doctor to tell them about your bloating and your frequent urination?\u00a0\u00a0That is the first thing you should do.\u00a0\u00a0No, frequent urination is not a symptom of gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Gastroparesis involves the stomach (and sometimes the small intestine).\u00a0\u00a0It is usually caused by neuropathy/nerve damage or sometimes stomach muscle damage, and the causes of the nerve/muscle damage can be numerous.You asked if gastroparesis is serious.\u00a0\u00a0Well, it depends what you mean by serious.\u00a0\u00a0It can be serious (though not deadly except in very rare circumstances) if it is severe on scan and your symptoms are severe-meaning significant pain and bloating or vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0People who have lots of nausea and vomiting and can't keep down their food are at risk of becoming anorexic/malnourished.\u00a0\u00a0Do you throw up as well?\u00a0\u00a0Some of those people have to go on tubes into their small intestines that bypass their stomachs.\u00a0\u00a0They are the EXCEPTION, though.\u00a0\u00a0Most people who have gastroparesis don't have severe GP and even if they do have severe GP, like me, they can keep their food down, so becoming underweight isn't an issue.\u00a0\u00a0Mine is severe on scan and I have pain every day from mine and bloating/pressure, especially after eating, that feels like my stomach is shoved up into my chest-very uncomfortable.\u00a0\u00a0I also have chronic reflux from mine, especially if I eat late at night.\u00a0\u00a0There are drugs for gastroparesis to move the food through more quickly if you do have it.\u00a0\u00a0Also, change in diet helps.\u00a0\u00a0It is best to eat small meals more often (like 5 times a day) and eat low-fat (fat slows digestion) and low-fiber (it's hard for a nerve-damaged stomach to grind up food).\u00a0\u00a0But low-fiber is unhealthy, so one can cook foods down to make them softer or puts raw foods in the blender.The best test to diagnose it is the gastric emptying scan, but they might want to do an endoscopy (EGD) first (put a scope down your esophagus and stomach)-if you haven't already had that-to see what is going on (make sure there is no blockage) before doing the scan.One more thing.\u00a0\u00a0You might not even have gastroparesis, but I'm writing this only in case you do.\u00a0\u00a0One of the MAIN causes of gastroparesis is DIABETES.\u00a0\u00a0Type in \"diabetes and gastroparesis\" and you will come up with tens of thousands of articles (it's called \"diabetic gastroparesis\").\u00a0\u00a0I am mentioning this because you said you have frequent urination and that is a major symptom of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Also, losing weight can be a symptom of diabetes as well (you mentioned you were thin and can't gain weight).\u00a0\u00a0I might be way off the mark, but please go to a doctor and tell him/her that you have chronic bloating of your abdomen, have to pee every hour, and can't seem to gain any weight.\u00a0\u00a0They can easily test you for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless, you should go to a doctor and tell them of ALL your symptoms-including the frequent urination.",
