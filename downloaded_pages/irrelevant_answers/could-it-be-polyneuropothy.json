            "answer": "I have Diabetic Neuro in my legs and I don't get any of that just tingling in my legs and somedays they feel week even if I go for a walk. 134 is great for a glucose reading so you didn't say if you were Diabetic??? If your ESR and Protein came back normal THAT IS GOOD so try not to worry too much. Another problem could be restless leg syndrome, my mom suffers from that and gets your symptoms but it is also treatable with meds..",

            "answer": "\"I had a glucose reading of 134\"If this reading was from an fasting glucose test it is NOT good and means you are diabetic. Since you're unsure if you ate before the test I would disregard the test results and test again. Do not eat or drink colored liquids for 8-10 hrs prior to testing. You want to be between 70-99 mg/dl.I'm no doctor but your neck issue could be from Entrapment Nueropathy which is caused by a pinched, trapped, or compressed nerve.",

            "answer": "If this is a fasting sugar and it is 134 is definetly doesn't mean you r diabetic. My dads doc did the same thing to him put him on sugar meds and almost killed him. Your sugar can get that high from stress, pain, or any number of things. That is why they do not do the glucose tolorance test much any more. They do the A1C test which monitors the % of sugar in your blood for the last 3 months or so.Do not worry about something until you go to a repytable doc like an endocrineologist. To many people are DX\"ED with diabetes that do not have it\u00a0\u00a0and are put on unessary meds. Trust me , I've been A dibetic and have been on every pill and shot out there.",
