            "answer": "TSH is the single most useful thyroid test we have currently available.\u00a0\u00a0The key is interpretation.\u00a0\u00a0The minimally elevated TSH (eg, 3.8) may mean early hypothyroidism and in these cases antibodies should be evaluated as many would have Hashimoto's.\u00a0\u00a0With the symptoms, it may be worth treating with levothyroxine.However, this is not likely the source of all your issues.\u00a0\u00a0You likely have Insulin Resistance Syndrome -- high triglycerides, overweight, blood sugar difficulties (even though you mention reactive hypoglycemia, this is likely an early manifestation of pre-diabetes), also high blood pressure and low HDL (good cholesterol) are associated with insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0Small frequent protein based meals will be the most helpful - but limit calories so that weight is lost not gained. (easier said than done I know...).",

            "answer": "Oops! The current range for TSH is .35-3.5, so your result is actually NOT normal. Also your doctor should be looking at your symptoms, not just a lousy lab that rarely works (the TSH)! There is no doubt in my mind that you are hypo. How is your Free T3 (note the word \u201cfree\u201d)Thyroid Antibodies (anti-TPO and TgAb. YOU NEED TO CHECK BOTH). You should also check your free T4. You want to see your FREEs at the TOP of the range, not at the bottom -- BOTTOM is HYPO. Run B12 (you want this higher than 600) and ferritin (this should be between 60-150). Hope this helps. And sorry you are not well.",

            "answer": "Sadly, most labs use outdated ranges and doctors overlook elevated results.Your TSH is a poor indicator of what is really going on in your body -- 4.38 can feel very hypo. I felt very tired and hypo when my TSh was 8. I felt a little more tired when my TSh was 682. Then when my TSh was less than 1 on synthroid I felt like the walking dead. Labs are just tools -- if you feel bad, it's time to make some changes. Symptoms are more important than labs.",
