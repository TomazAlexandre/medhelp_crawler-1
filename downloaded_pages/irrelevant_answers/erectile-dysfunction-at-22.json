            "answer": "If you are having pain, then I think the kidney problem could definitely be linked. I'm a little upset that a doctor would want to just prescribe viagra without even thinking about the deeper issue. Having a once in a blue moon erection problem at a young age is not actually a problem (except for your ego.) However, the pain is what I would be concerned about, because that is definitely not normal. Have you been tested for diabetes or anything like that? Are you still urinating frequently? I would do some research before you go back to the doctor again (a different one!) so you know what questions to ask about what you are experiencing. Please keep in mind that erection and sex drive can also be affected by anxiety - therefore, if you are worried about getting it up, it will be more difficult to.I hope this helps. Best of luck to you!",

    "question": "Hi,I am going to talk about two separate problems, maybe they're linked maybe not.In April 2008 at the age of 20 started to have more and more frequent trips to the toilet to urinateI went to see a doctor they ran some tests and said that everything seemed OK.Life went on.......I still used to urinate a lot but not as much as I used to in the past, then tragedy struck in September 2009 I was having sex with my girlfriend and my erection went down!!!\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't believe it!!!Slowly slowly after that my sex drive was killed off, i couldn't even get hard even if i wanted to. Seeing a sexy woman made no difference, even though my brain was seeing her as attractive the message wasn't getting to my ****.Me and my girl even broke up because of this as she thought I was cheating on her and said I made her feel unattractive.But she had know idea of what was going on inside me....The pain I was going through my penis chambers used to go tight and pain me also, my lower stomach used to pain like hell. It was like i had a penis that was on fire at times.Then all of a sudden in March 2010 I started to get my sex drive back slowly...., then seeing sexy women and getting a hard on days had arrived once more, which was perfectly normal, in my eyes anyway, I met up with my girl again and gave it to her good like old times, my penis was rock solid and didn't go down at all during the session in fact we had sex three times that night. I thought I was getting back to normal.Then a week later the painful symptoms returned, and messed me up once more.I decided to go to a Chinese herbalist as when I went to my doctor he started talking rubbish about Viagra. NOT AT 22 MY FRIEND!!!, there had to be some deeper explanation to this nonsense.So I told the Chinese herbalist my symptoms/problems and he told me all of this mess is caused by my kidney weakening over the course of 2008 till now. And know i will have to take some herbs to restore my energy and strengthen the kidney once more, he took \u00a3200 off of me. I took the herbs but it didn't work.Do you think it is my kidneys, do you think my problems are linked?Please someone give me advice on what to do as I am a 22 year old young man and shouldn't be going through this.Thank You",
