            "answer": "I've recently been looking into a similar issue and it seems the entire web is out to make me believe anything that can be wrong with the genitals is due to herpes. However, after almost 3 weeks of searching daily I have found some info on other possible causes of lesions and sores, such as candidas balanitis (a type of yeast infection), Zoon balanitis, and some others I've forgotten now, but that I found from researching the two I've just mentioned.Despite what most STD scare websites seem to suggest, as long as your sores are not \"vesicular\" in nature (blister or pouch-like) then it is unlikely to be herpes.Its a shame it took me so long to find information on my issue (which I hope helps solve yours too) all because there is so much misinformation regarding genital health issues and STDs. As informed as everyone should be about STDs, I think all these websites informing us somewhat incorrectly about STDs and ignoring non-STDs is doing more harm than good!",

            "answer": "I had similar red sores to the top of my penis head. This may well have been after sweaty exercise and the not washing the penis head from sugars, my own bacteria and sweat. I was knackered at the time and did not draw the foreskin back and wash thoroughly as I normally do. I have read about the causes and treated the symptom; which has now cleared.The symptoms are similar to yeast infection (sugars / thrush) reported from women.I used skin cream - MONISTAT 7.There are similar yeast (virginal) creams for the same result.PaulEngland",

            "answer": "I have a similar experience to Paul.I have had no sexual contact for a considerable time so I know that it is not possible for it to be a sexually transmitted disease.Interestingly I have only these had 3x bouts of ulcers, small tears and weeping clear liquid on the end of the glans ,( looks like 'sweating' ) since being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes.I also only have these ulcers when having UTIs and the associated dehydration so hydration is another possible factor.Although I seem to be managing my Diabetes with morning fasting levels of 5-6 mmol/l I feel it has to be something to do with blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Penis ulcers are a common symptom of Diabetes. It may pay to buy a BS tester and check your blood sugar levels",

    "question": "A couple weeks ago I developed some sort of sore on the top of my penis right before the head. Sometimes it is moist and secrets a clear fluid. The wound is long and covers almost half of my penis on both sides. However it's not very wide. It keeps trying to heal by scabbing over, however when I walk (which I do a lot of, it is required in my job) the skin tears and it's unable to heal.I have been to the doctors and they said they had no idea what it was. They took swabs for testing but have yet to get back to me. This was 2 weeks ago.From my own research, I keep getting pointed towards herpes. However, I only have one sex partner who I have not slept with in a month and she does not show any signs of herpes/infections on her vagina. I have recently gone away for the summer to a military base and am wondering if this could be caused by bed bugs as I also have a bunch of bumps on my legs.Sorry if this is in the wrong forum, but I didn't know where else to go for \"weeping penile sores\".Thank you.",
