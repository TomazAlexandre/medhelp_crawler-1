But ask your doctor why he'd wait so long, perhaps he has a good reason? If not ask/demand for the c-section to be planned earlier. Btw, your baby can still come naturally before 39 weeks, maybe he waits to the max to give natural a chance?",

            "answer": "Unless absolutely necessary I would not have a section before 39 weeks and size of baby alone is not a medical reason no matter how \"big\" he or she is measuring.\u00a0\u00a0 Because a baby isn't being squeezed out the birth canal during a section, the baby can have a lot of fluid in the lungs and more breathing problems which can lead to a NICU stay. What are these measurements based on? Ultrasounds are highly inaccurate and final measurements can be off too. With mothers with diabetes, even if baby is measuring big lung function can be slow to develop so I would never ever schedule a c/s before 39 weeks. Not only that i think if you really have concerns you should probably seek an optniin from another dr and not a bunch of internet strangers in my honest opinion.",

    "question": "I know I've been complaining a lot now that I'm at the end of this pregnancy, but here's more. I'm 34 weeks and 4 days. Baby is measuring at 39 weeks. She's estimated to weight 8 pounds and 6 ounces. I have diabetes, and am now having high blood pressure due to so much stress I'm dealing with. I'm retaining a lot of water now. I've gained 7 pounds in one week. My complaint now: The Doctor said I definitely will need to have a c section because of the baby's size, but he said he won't schedule it until 39 weeks. I'm not sure why he would let the baby keep growing and getting so big that I can't even deliver naturally, but not schedule me sooner. Does anyone have any suggestions or similar experiences?",
