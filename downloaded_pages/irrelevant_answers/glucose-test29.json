            "answer": "Depending on just how high your blood sugar is your Dr may decide you have gestational diabetes or he/she may order the 3 hr test.I failed the 1 hour and was told because mine was really high they wouldn't bother with the 2 or 3 hour test. I switched Dr's and was sent for the 2 hr test, which the results came back \"Glucose within normal range.\"",

            "answer": "Yeah you have to watch these lab techs.\u00a0\u00a0If they measure it wrong it could throw the whole test off.\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to take this test with an attitude of doubt.\u00a0\u00a0Please educate yourself on the hypothesis and theory as well as the control subjects and test subjects.\u00a0\u00a0They are still basing this test off of a study from the 1960's with a modern day test agent.My first I was one point away from failing the 1 hour.\u00a0\u00a0My second I was right on the cut off and the doctor tried to fit this\u00a0\u00a0square peg into a round whole.\u00a0\u00a0I then challenged the doctor and the lab techs since my test was not measured out was accused or had the scare tactic of you are a bad mother if you don't do the 3 hour test. I told them your fired! Still took the 3 hour and was sick and my son did not move for two weeks after the test.Also ask to see the label on the bottle and memorize the ingredients and name of the glucola maker.\u00a0\u00a0This is what I'm doing with my 3rd.Best of luck.",

            "answer": "Excuse you? \"You have to watch these lab techs\". Lol. I'm one of those lab techs. \"If they measure it wrong\"..? A glucose is a very simple, basic test. The phlebotomist draws a tube of blood, the tech puts the tube on an analyzer, the analyzer gives you a result. If anyrhing affected your result, it would likely have been preanalytic - for example, you cannot eat or smoke during the test period, must stay inactive, the drinkbis to be consumed withing a 5 minute window, amd drawn at 1 hour. Don't blame the lab because your glucose was borderline or because you don't agree with your doctor's interpretation of it.That being said, if you do have to do the test again, ask your doctor if there is an alternative to the glucola. For example, my lab procedures references 28 regular sized jelly beans as an appropriate substitute.",

            "answer": "Obviously these tests can go pretty wrong... i was tested before 4 weeks or so and had a value of 113 in the first test, i mean without drinking that glucose drink... (Sorry if i write something incorrectly, I'm German ;)\u00a0\u00a0)20 minutes later they measured me with a value of 62... Still they didn't consider this. Now according to this test i have a pregnancy diabetes. I first stuck to the diet they recommended but felt that this wasn't good for my body... Then I continued eating like before. The next morning (before breakfast) i had a value of 68 and after each meal around 90... The value before breakfast must be <90 and after the meals <145... so I'm obviously miles away from a Diabetes...I really don't know from where the first value came. The girl in the lab was a stupid b*tch... so i guess she just did something wrong...I don't wanna say that this is something common to happen, but obviously it does...",

Ive been referred to diabetes education classes next week (we will learn about diet and testing our blood sugar over 2wk period). I too am upset about the results. I never drink lucozade and the ingredients are highly suspicious (it contains asparatame which is an artificial sugar): \"Carbonated Water, Glucose Syrup (25%), Citric Acid (E330), Lactic Acid (E270), Flavouring (unspecified), Preservatives (Potassium Sorbate, Sodium Bisulphite (E-222)), Caffeine, Antioxidant (Ascorbic Acid), Colour (Sunset Yellow (E110), Ponceau 4R). A warning is printed on packaging that the colourings may have an adverse effect on activity and attention in children.\"I'm also wondering whether they consider the individual's height, weight,BMI and ethnic background? So yeah, I'm quite upset about this but going to find out more and just eat less sweet things (even though this pregnancy I was more drawn to savoury things anyway)",
