            "answer": "Hello there!!\u00a0\u00a0I had aortic valve replacement surgery ten months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I chose the mechanical because I am not sure I would do the surgery again.\u00a0\u00a0I am 53, and had endocarditis.\u00a0\u00a0I have to take coumadin everyday for the rest of my life and have the level tested regularly.\u00a0\u00a0But to me, the possibility of complications from coumadin greatly outweighed the risk of another surgery as I get older.\u00a0\u00a0You are very young, so your concerns may be different.\u00a0\u00a0For people who are vigorously physically active, the biological valve is often the better choice.\u00a0\u00a0You can be very active with the mechanical\u00a0\u00a0valve but you can't scuba dive!\u00a0\u00a0With strides in heart surgery, many folks with the biological valve hope for big improvements and non-invasive procedures that may be here before they need the valve replaced again, and I do think those possibilities are on the horizon.\u00a0\u00a0I am happy with the choice I made to have the mechanical, but it is such a personal decision, good luck to you!!",

At your young age, if given a choice, go with the mechanical valve.\u00a0\u00a0The natural valves tend to calcify and need replacement after 10-15 years.\u00a0\u00a0My valve was replaced when I was 30.",
