            "answer": "Interesting question. The older laser technology required a guidewire to be passed centrally through the plaque blockage, and the laser was proceeded along this. Many times the plaque was just too hard (calcified) for the wire to penetrate. Now however, lasers are guided from the rear of the device, not requiring any guidewire. The benefits of laser is that it removes plaque, blasting it into tiny molecules. There are some issues, but the extent of the problems is not yet clear because the data is not yet sufficient. When plaque is removed from the lining of the artery, a rough surface remains, rough enough to encourage clots. Re-stenosis was a real problem with the older lasers which is why they ballooned the artery after and placed stents.I believe in most cases with the new lasers they just give medication to help inhibit restenosis. I still think there would be limitations to the laser option. Firstly, probably whether there is a Cardiologist with the necessary experience and training to use the technology in your hospital. Secondly, the location of the blockage. If the blockage is ostial, then it would probably be very difficult. Thirdly, I'm not sure about artery size limitations. Stents can only go into arteries larger than something like 2.5-3.0mm. I don'tknow how small the laser device is.Out of interest, why is bypass being suggested if there is no chest pain or shortness of breath? Have they done a nuclear scan to make sure there is insufficient collateral formation? If lots of collaterals have opened (which are natural bypasses) then is would be silly to perform a bypass. If the 100% blockage has caused tissue death, then a bypass will not revive the tissue anyway, so what's the point.",

I can tell you to open the 100% blockage is not advised, and I have read and answered many posts and researched the subject.The 100% blockage develops over a long period of time (chronic), and as the occlusion develops there are tributary vessels that open up and begin to flow into other vessels that begin to feed the blood deficit locations.\u00a0\u00a0The more occlusion the more tributary vessels and force of blood flow to open and dilate the collateral vessels... tributary medically referred to as collateral vessels.\u00a0\u00a0By the time the artery is 100% occluded there has been other vessels (collaterals) providing oxygenated blood to keep the heart cells viable....to open the 100% blockage would drain the collateral vessels and the blood flowing through newly opened vessel may be ineffective as there would be a loss of circulation downstream from the blockage due to the inactiveness of blood flow that could/would cause the network of vessels to close or shrink...to reopen may or may not be possible.I didn't have diabetes at the time of my treatment 7 years ago, but I don't believe that changes the equation for best treatment.\u00a0\u00a0We know diabetes often prevents angina from occluded vessels and that may explain why the patient isn't experiencing any pain.Hope this provides a perspective and answers your questions, and if you have any further questions or comment you are welcome to respond.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the question, take care,Ken",

    "question": "is it possible to go for laser heart surgery in triple vessel disease wherein there are three major blockages of 100% , 90% and 85% as the doctor has suggested to go for cabg.The patient is diabetic but presently not having any chest pain or breathing difficulties.Which is better to go for laser heart surgery or cabg in this case?
