            "answer": "Hi,Yes you are right in thinking that could be blood pressure. Please monitor your blood pressure with a home monitoring kit for about a week. Headache and dizziness on standing indicates orthostatic hypotension which can occur due to dehydration, anemia, diabetes, use of medications like antidepressents. But you also say you have light sensitivity so there is a possibility that there can be two reasons for your headache migraine and postural hypotension. Please maintain your fluid intake, eat regular small meals throughout the day. Avoid bright light and loud sounds. Abstain from alcohol and tobacco.Good Luck!",

            "answer": "Hi, As you have migraine and you are having medicines, do relax and continue the same. One of the commonest and important triggering factor for migraine is Stress either physical or mental so the stress you are undergoing for these years is itself may be acting as a triggering factor without much relief.

    "question": "I am a 23 year old female with unusual migraines i guess you could say. In may 2007 i started getting a sharp stabbing pain in the right temple followed by a very painful pressure sensation. The pressure is always on the right side and goes from the area right behind my temple and forward. It feels as if my head is going to burst open. I have had a CT Scan and it was normal, i have been on Prednisone, Lamictal, Midrin, and Immitrex all without relief. The pressure senstation will last anywhere from just under a minute to ten or more. As far as i can tell i have no tearing in my right eye when this occurs. No redness. I have noticed that i become SUPER sensitive to light and i can hear a popping noise in my right ear. I have seen my GP many many times for this and have also seen a neurologist who diagnosed me with SUNCT syndrome. I do not believe this is the correct diagnosis. One more thing, i notice this pain occurs more when i go from sitting to standing or laying to standing. Could my blood pressure be a problem?",
