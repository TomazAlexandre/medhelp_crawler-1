    "question": "Hello, my 4 year old son was diagnosed with SVT 8 months ago - he is on bisopronol 2.5 mg daily which seems to control him well. We tried an ablasion a month ago - and it didn't work , so he is back on medication. My question is - do these long term use of medications affect him in anyway ? I have heard of stunting growth? any mental issues? thank you. Conny",
