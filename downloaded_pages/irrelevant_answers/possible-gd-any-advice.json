            "answer": "In my first pregnancy my sugars where high on the first test...from what i hear, most peoples are...and then you have to drink a lot more of that nasty juice and do a 3 hour gluecose test to see.\u00a0\u00a0Mine were high and we suspected gestational diabetes because diabetes run in my family, but after taking the second, more extended test, they came back fine and it was just a mistake...so i wouldnt worry too much about it.\u00a0\u00a0They are only with you through your pregnancy and if you do have them, you might have to talk to a nutrisinist to get on a better diet! (yea right...pickles and ice cream all day everyday)!!! Hope this helps a little bit! Good Luck.",

            "answer": "I had gd with my first pg.\u00a0\u00a0I beleive I have posted onthis subkect before--you can look in the archives--but it is not just sweets--it is your carb intake--if you eat a lot of breads, pastas--these are realy what affect your sugar---regualr pop has a lot of sugar--if you do have this you will need to switch to diet pop or none at all.\u00a0\u00a0I followed a diabetic diet--made the things I love really hard to eat--but it is inthe best interest of the baby to watch it.\u00a0\u00a0You can eat lots of cheese, meats, eggs, certain fruits and\u00a0\u00a0veggies--alot of the atkins products if you are inclined for the money.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't.\u00a0\u00a0Broccli soup witha chicken breast was a staple for lunch for me.\u00a0\u00a0I was pg in fall & winter easier to eap soup than this time of year.\u00a0\u00a0I would still og out to eat if you are worried about that--they make a diabetic book that you can buy at any type of Mart store--gives you total carb count in the food they are serving for major resturaunts.Just relax--be good on your food the day before",

    "question": "Well I thought I was doing good, but now I'm really worried. My Dr. just called and informed me that my blood sugar level is higher than normal (161, should be below 130) and that I needed retesting for Gestational Diabetes. I was wondering if any of you have/have had it, and what changes did it make in your pregnancy/health/babys'health? I'm confused because over the course of my pg I've cut out all sodas other than sprite and haven't really overdone it with the sweets. I guess I've ate my share of ice cream, but over the course of a week, maybe eat sweets 1-2 if that, and nothing big. He said that it had to do with the way my body was producing insulin? Also, if you have or have had it, what type of meal plan did you follow? What were some of the foods you ate? Maybe give me a day to day list of the foods you would have for breakfast, lunch and dinner? I have a week and a half until my test but I'd like to start correcting it now. Please give me some advice if you can.",
