            "answer": "Hi!Pain predominantly on the left side can be due to hypothyroidism which you have. Hence see if the thyroid is under control or not by getting a thyroid profile done. Other possibilities are fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or due to bad posture. Lyme and lupus are the other possibilities. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
