In march, 2014 i got the complete treatment and the blood tests and urine tests confirms the same. However, my doctor pointed out that there was some sugar in my urine, so i got tested for Blood sugar, and have been diagnosed for type 2 diabetes.My doctor prescribed me Metformin (1500 mg daily). While i started taking the medicine, after a few weeks, i started feeling stiffness in my fingers in the morning. it gradually has spread to other joints and bones as well in a few weeks time. i regularly feel week and lazy. also i have noticed white tongue since last couple of weeks and have been taking fluconazole 150 mg for last 10 days...although no benefit.fearing that it might be rheumatoid arthritis i got a panel test done. the test results shows everyting in the range.(except uric acid which is although in range but on a higher side of 6.5 and blood platelete on a lower side of 155)Please help me to understand why am i getting these joint pains....I have also attached my test results....please someone help me on this....",
