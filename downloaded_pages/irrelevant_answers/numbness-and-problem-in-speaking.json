            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Did you undergo a MRI of brain as well?What is the trigger for your symptoms since you say they occur sometimes?These symptoms could be due to neuralgias, pinched nerve, and diabetes or vitamin deficiency.I would suggest you to take multivitamin supplements and see if it improves your symptoms. Take care!",

    "question": "Hello,I did not know what category should I put this question in. I am having this problem since quite some time and having it intermittently. The symptoms when I have this problem are as follows :1. I cannot speak properly. Somehow I pronounce wrong words instead of the words I intend to. In fact I am typing wrong words and correcting more often that I typically have to.2. I have some some kind of numbness in my right lip, right hand etc.This problem happens once in a while.I had shown to a doctor earlier but he found no issue. He said I am stressed. But I do not think. He did an MRI and did not find anything wrong. I feel there is something wrong.Can you please advise?Regards,Sastry",
