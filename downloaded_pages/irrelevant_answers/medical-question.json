Most common cause for neuropathy is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It can also be due to metabolic disorders, vitamin deficiencies, infections and traumatic injuries. Other causes could be due to scabies, eczema, tineapedis (fungal infection) and psoriasis. Scabies infection is caused by a mite Sarcoptesscabiei, it burrows in the skin folds of hands and feet and causes intense itching mostly at night. You may need to consult your primary care physician to detect the cause.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
