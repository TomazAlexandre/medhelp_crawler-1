Also jaundice, respiratory problems, and it can double he chance of baby developing adhd before age 6.. I don't want to ruin my babys life with problems that I may have caused because I get GD",

    "question": "I have my appointment set for the 8th of May.\u00a0\u00a0I am really scared that I might fail this test.. I don't know what to do.. I don't eat a lot of sweet stuff but there's other things that have sugars.. and I have history of diabetes in my family from my dads side but no history of gestational diabetes. But i am prediabetic. My doctor never told me to check my blood or to take any medication. Just to change my diet and I did. But this was before my pregnancy. I am really worried that I will have it.. are there any prediabetics out there that didn't get GD? If not I would still like your prayers so that I pass this test. Please and thank you :/",
