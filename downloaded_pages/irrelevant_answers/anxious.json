            "answer": "You can talk to your ob about different options if you want to stay away from a c section. As for induction there's 2 ways that I'm aware they do. They give you meds in your iv which makes you dialate or they break your water. They had to break my water and there was a little pressure and you have to lay very still but it was quick",

            "answer": "I didn't start dilating until I went into labor. Which was at 41 weeks and 1 day. My cervix wasn't even thinning out. It was just getting soft. My doctor told me that my baby was going to be a little big because I got diabetes during my pregnancy but I heard of people giving birth to 10 pound babies so I didn't care about the weight. I wasn't going to get induced. The doctor was bringing up induction at my 40 week appointment but I declined that. The doctors don't know the exact weight so I wouldn't worry. My baby was just 7 pounds 13 ounces. They shouldn't do a c section unless it's medically necessary:)",

    "question": "Hey ladies! I have this dilemma that I need help with. I'm 39w 1d and I saw my obgyn two days ago,\u00a0\u00a0I'm still not dilating and my doctor says he might be too big for me to push even though he's in the right position. She also said she usually doesn't make her patients wait and my due date is next wednesday (I see her the day before) I really don't want a c-section but is that my only option? And what about being induced? ? I don't really mind because I just want my baby out! But I'm not sure because this is my first child! Any advice? Or experiences I'm similar situations? ?",
