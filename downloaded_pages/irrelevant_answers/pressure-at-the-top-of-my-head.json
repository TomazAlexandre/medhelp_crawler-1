            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Are there other symptoms present? Was there a previous head trauma? Tension headaches usually resolves with pain medications, rest and removal of the stress/ triggers. If it persists, and you have high blood pressure, regular evaluation by your doctor is important to help rule out presence of other conditions such as diabetes or dyslipidemia. Additional diagnostic tests such as blood chemistry and imaging studies may also help. Take care and do keep us posted.",
