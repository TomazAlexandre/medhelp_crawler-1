            "answer": "Adhesions are only one possible reason for constipation. I'd say it's a severity and position of a particular adhesion which matters and not \"how many\" are there.Diabetes often causes constipation, mostly due to affected gastro-intestinal nerves and arteries (atherosclerosis). This can lead to gastroparesis (slow gastric emptying) and decreased intestinal motility.I guess adhesions could be evaluated and resolved by laparoscopy. There's nothing much to do about nerves and arteries. Activity, enough fluid and appropriate diet (fibers) are needed to help with constipation.",

            "answer": "Thank you for the information about adhesions. I've never had it properly explained before. Unfortunately, the fluids and movement thing just doesn't help. The fibre (which initially I did anyway as part of diabetic control) had to changed to low residue diet as it was causing severe problems with bowel -\u00a0\u00a0almost blocking on several occasions. I will ask my Diabetic consultant if a laparoscopy could be considered at my next clinic visit. I feel that as I'm quite good at getting on with things that I'm being left to cope with an increasingly depressing situation which affects my life more & more.",

    "question": "I am type 1diabetic for 25 years, 57 years old and have had severe problems with constipation for years. I have had three abdominal surgeries and have had tests which show signs of\u00a0\u00a0an appreciable amount of adhesions. The pain I have is always on the lower right side of the abdomen, even when a cyst was found on - and removed - with the left ovary. I require 14/16 Senokot every night in order to have a bowel movement in the morning. Could my diabetic condition be aggravating the problem, and how many adhesions would there need to be in order to be called appreciable, percent wise?",
