            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If you are always hungry, then there are three problems that you should get investigated for. These are acidity with GERD (this you have), diabetes and thyroid disorders. Do not take any supplements until the diagnosis is made. A disease caught earlier and treated earlier has fewer problems later. Remember this and consult your PCP. Some blood tests will be run for blood sugar and thyroid levels.You will need treatment for reflux which is a combination of medicines and life style changes. Omeprazole is a good drug to combat this. Along with it you can try over the counter antacids. However I would recommend you see a doctor and take medication under a doctor\u2019s supervision. Avoid heavy meals and eat frequent small meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, smoking, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bet at least 2 hours after food.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks Guys. This is very helpful. I really appreciate your time and advise.No one in family has any known thyroid issues. That scares me. But my dad is a diabetic and was diagnoised when he was around 35 yrs old. Diabetes is a scary thing at my age. I really worried as I'm a vegetarian I do not get enough proteins to keep me ful. Yes, I have to change my eating habits. Also just in general are protein supplements from good well know brands like optimum nutriton(100% whey) and Vitamin shoppe good?",

            "answer": "HiThe effect of whey protein on mice has been studied but the effect of whey protein on the human body is still under study. Whey protein is supposed to help fight against cancer and infection. Many side effects like kidney stones, hair loss, liver damage, joint problems etc have been reported. However the actual effect this protein, used as a commercial substitute, can only be known when clinical trials on human beings are successful. Many clinical trials are still being conducted and some just completed. It will be some time before we have published results from these trials.Hence today it is very difficult to say exactly what side effects a commercial preparation of whey can cause.Until we have the results, all I can suggest is that you use natural whey. Products like 100% whey and Vitamin shoppe have not been cleared from bodies like FDA and other such drug controlling agencies. Hence their safety cannot be commented upon.I would also suggest you stop using these products if you are using them or if at all you want to use then consult your doctor once and take this supplement under medical supervision.Hope this helps. Take care!",
