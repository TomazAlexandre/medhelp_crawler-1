            "answer": "Hello,Granuloma annulare is a benign inflammatory dermatosis. It has been shown to be associated with some malignancies like lymphomas, leukemias and solid tumors. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "I have had GA for over 20 years.\u00a0\u00a0Outta nowhere, for no apparent reason, I got a few, we treated them with cortizone injections and they went away only to be replaced with new ones.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had any on my face but they show up constantly.\u00a0\u00a0Rarely do they itch but they are ugly.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried the creams and they are useless in my case.\u00a0\u00a0My patches seem to have about a 5 year life span.\u00a0\u00a0If I get one in a highly visible area I will get it injected but other thatn that I have learned to live with them and dress around them,\u00a0\u00a0No middriff baring for me because right now I have a band of about 20 across my belly, didnt wear short shorts for years because of a couple bad ones on the back of my thighs.\u00a0\u00a0 I have had other skin conditions also - small tumors removed - nothing cancerous.\u00a0\u00a0I was a hairstylist for 10 years and I thought the chemicals were to blame but I 've been out of that now for longer than I did it and I still have the GA so I guess that wasnt the case.\u00a0\u00a0OH - I was about 25 when I got my first flare up and I am 45 now and it shows no sign of stopping.\u00a0\u00a0So sorry but you may have to learn to live with this for the long term.",

            "answer": "My wife first got GA after being given Atenelol. It lasted for several years then cleared up but not completely. She still had splotches on her legs. Then they gave her Metoprolol and here comes the GA again. This time it is worse than ever. Her legs look terrible. There is no wearing shorts for her. The people that gave her the Metoprolol knew she had a reaction to Beta Blockers but gave them to her anyway. We are thinking of contacting an attorney because her appearance is just ruined. She is scared and embarrassed because of this condition. The doctors told her it was caused from Diabetes but her whole family has Diabetes and they don't have this condition. I think thats a crock of Bull.",

            "answer": "I'm only 16 and my derm told me I have GA. She gave me a topical steroid but the only difference I saw is they started appearing in other places. They've been growing slowly, and I currently have 14 different patches of GA of varying sizes and colors. I dont have any existing conditions, but I have heard GA is connected to auto-immune disorders and both sides of my family have extensive lines of different auto-immune disorders. I want to know what is going on and if they are a sign that there is something else going on or if it is simply there, but I can't go to the doctor until July. If anyone knows of something that could help or to put my mind at ease, I'd be very grateful.",

I really had Gorgeous hair.\u00a0\u00a0I was told the GA was from intense psychological stress&quot;...well, that surely was the case with my pretty long hair falling out.\u00a0\u00a0These bumps are all over my legs....intrestingly enough, one cold night, i put my husbands thick socks on and the next day...my legs..where the socks were almost cleared up. The part of my leg that did not have the tight socks on had alot of the bumps, so i am wondering about oxygen exposure feeding the rash.\u00a0\u00a0I am at wits end.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot wear a dress that is not floor legnth, and another friend...has \\skin cancer;..and is dying from it, and the rash on his face LOOKS exactly like the GA that I have.\u00a0\u00a0I realize that medicine is not an exact science, but what the hell???? I would think the community of Dermatologists should know MORE than what I am being told.\u00a0\u00a0This is very unsettling...the creams, as mentioned above, are Hepa-Toxic, so....I hope More people would comment on their experiences re: this awful scourge they call \"GA\".\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks.",
