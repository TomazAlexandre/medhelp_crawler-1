            "answer": "Hi there!There are no exercises, medications or supplements found to be effective in treatment of avascular necrosis. Lesions involving smaller regions are mostly managed conservatively while most others require surgery. Biphosphonates are a group of medications that are believed to slow the bone breakdown, although the effect is yet to be established substantially. Other than this, other preventive measures that may be helpful are avoiding alcohol, control of diabetes and increased cholesterol (if involved), avoiding radiation and steroids etc. I would suggest discussing the situation in detail with your orthopedician for appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",

            "answer": "This is the bad thing with AVN, from what I understand there is no way of knowing the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone can guess, although it seems nobody knows.\u00a0\u00a0I had decompression and the collapse was reformed from the inside, which worked until I hit the gym too hard and now I have catches, pops, and pain in both hips again. I am 31 going on 32 and this is debilitating as I have always been physically active.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot find a job, even with a desk job I still have to deal with the intermittent pain which makes me lose focus.\u00a0\u00a0Something as simple as my girlfriend moving in bed can cause an extreme amount of pain.\u00a0\u00a0This is also compounded by my lower back inflammation which shoots pain down my legs clear to my feet. What would you suggest I do and would it be possible to draw disability as I have not been able to find suitable work and I am going to be in a position where I may lose my house if I cannot find a job I can perform?",
