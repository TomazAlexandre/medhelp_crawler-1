            "answer": "\"Diabetes with hypoglycemic moments\" is not a diagnosis! Both highs and lows can be a part of diabetes and the key is to manage the diabetes to minimize both. If you are having a lot of lows something is not right. First of all, are you on any kind of medication or are you working on managing your diabetes with diet and exercise? When are you getting the lows? When you are due to eat? After a meal? At bedtime? I'm not sure I know what you mean by \"the carb plan\" and \"the protein plan\". Many people find that if they lower their carb intake they have better (lower) BG numbers. Protein is merely what people eat to replace some of the carbs. If you are eating, let's say a salad for lunch and are going low before dinner than you need to add a small amount of carbs, let's say some crackers or a piece of fruit. A big bowl of pasta is too much carbs for many diabetics.The way to find out what is the correct amount of carbs to keep your numbers level as well as when and how often you eat is to test, test, test and see how your glucose reacts to various foods (carbs). Also if you exercise you need to figure this in as it can make you go low. Hypoglycemia is unpleasant and hyperglycemia can lead to complications. You need to figure out as much as possible how to stay in target range. It might help to discard the notion of The Plan, because we are all different. Find out what works for you and make that Your Plan!",

            "answer": "\"I took GTT test and they said Diabetes with hypoglycemic moments.\"It would interest us to know who \"they\" is. As Zoe stated, this statement is not a diagnosis as a medical professional would not make a blank statement as such.You best bet is to make an appointment to see an Endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in diabetic care and treatment. He/she can also refer you to a nutritionist to help determine/decide upon good balanced foods. This link will will help you understand Glycemic Index foods http://www.diabetesnet.com/diabetes_food_diet/glycemic_index.phpYou can read and believe all the hype about fad diets but they do NOT work. The key to managing and controlling diabetes has always been proper nutrition, maintaining weight [a few pounds over is not maintaining], and physical activity -\u00a0\u00a0like walking for 30 minutes as if you're trying catch your airplane flight. Only lately has proper amount of sleep and stress management been added to above. But by all means, you'll never get the answers you're looking for without getting simple blood testing performed by a doctor.",

            "answer": "Ok sorry for the shortness of explaination, so here is a longer one. :)I want to the doctors, because I have been excercising, am normally hyper and wasn't losing and sometimes gaining weight. Very frustratingI was having some issues so the doctor took a blood test and discovered after fasting my numbers were a little high, then she told me to cut back on my sugar intake and keep track of my sugar levels. I did research and learned the many things that have or turn into sugar in the body and I reduced them, but then the numbers were way low, so they sent me to get a GTT test which indicated that I have diabetes. I had extreme high with test that turned into very fast low where I shook and felt horrible. I couldn't even speak during the sharp lows.They said I have diabetes. The doctor put me on a diabetic meal plan with complex carbs based on the new pyramid. The idea was to get me and sustain me at my normal levels. It made my lows even lower, so they put me on the diabetic protein plan which I was told the body can turn the proteins into what is needed, so it can raise and sustain the blood sugar levels.I began to figure out when that didn't work well that it was up to me to customize the meals to what I needed to keep my sugar closer based on how high or low it was at the time. This is all trial and error.I am getting there, but still having some trouble so I am going to see another specialist and nutritionist.They do not want me on medicines yet, but I do carry icing and glucose tablets for the lows. So it is the low's for the most part that are the problem.I'm also learning that if I eat a protein or complex carb and eat something sweet or turns into sugar in the body that it completely overrides the protein or complex carb and sharp lows happen.My issues are I don't like a lot of meat and they have me on more calories then I have ever eaten in my life. Before this plan I was getting maybe 1000 a day and now they want me to eat 8 small meals of 1800 calories based on the meal plan.I have to get my sugar up to 130 so that I can come back from a 30 minute walk at normal levels otherwise it spirals down. This is why I am going to see 2 specialists.And yes I realize losing weight may help so I am working on getting back into shape. I have lost over 100lbs so far. I went from a athletic teen, to a over weight 20 something, to a struggling to lose the last bit of weight 37 year old.Thank you for your help",

    "question": "I've been on the carb plan and the protein plan I guess I have to go to a specialist, because I am still having hypoglycemic days a lot. I took GTT test and they said Diabetes with hypoglycemic moments. If I am sick my readings are closer to normal or slightly high, but if I am well I get lots of lows, then I get frustrated and eat pasta and it goes high, then drops too low again. It's very frustrating. I can't think or speak correctly when it is low and I am freezing with vision and stomach problems when high. It doesn't matter if I just stick to the plan it still is low.",
