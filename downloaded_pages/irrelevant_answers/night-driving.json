            "answer": "There are two other possibilities for what could cause difficulty with your vision at night:1.\u00a0\u00a0If you have astigmatism (a lack of symmetry in the shape of your cornea on the eye's surface) the effect of the astigmatism on your vision will be worse at night.\u00a0\u00a0As your pupil dilates, light entering your eye passes through a greater area of the cornea.\u00a0\u00a0If there are irregularities in the corneal curvature, it scatters the light somewhat which makes things look blurry.If you already wear toric contact lenses (which correct for astigmatism) it could be that you need stronger correction for this at night.\u00a0\u00a0You may be able to get a pair of glasses to wear when you drive to help with this problem.2.\u00a0\u00a0If your pupils dilate a lot at night, you may be seeing a ghost image refracted through the bevel along the edge of the contact lens.\u00a0\u00a0I know about this because it happens to me.You should talk with your optometrist about your night vision issues and see what he/she suggests.\u00a0\u00a0Try to be as specific as possible for the doctor about what the problem is with your night vision (general blurriness, ghost images, dimming or loss of contrast, etc).\u00a0\u00a0That might help narrow down the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",
