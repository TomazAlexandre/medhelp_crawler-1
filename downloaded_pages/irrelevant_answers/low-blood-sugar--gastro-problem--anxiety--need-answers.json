            "answer": "Hi macmom03!\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical professional and the information given is based on my own personal experience from having a 17 year old daughter who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot gather from your posting if your daughter has diabetes or not so I don't want to go into areas that may not be applicable.\u00a0\u00a0Our expertise here is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of this, I'll share what I know with you.My daughter had similar symptoms as your daughter is having, but my daughter would wake up in the middle of the night with severe nausea/headache and then vomit violently with bile and mostly undigested food coming up.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed with abdominal migraines and put on a medicine (I'm sorry, I don't remember the name of it, but if I had to do it all over again, I might not have given it to her as one of the side effects was weight gain and at the age of 13, this is not too desirable).\u00a0\u00a0It did seem to lessen the occurance of these episodes, but I am not positive that it didn't lessen due to the fact that she just grew out of them.\u00a0\u00a0I find it pretty interesting also that your daughter is the same age as my daughter was when she experienced this problem, don't you?\u00a0\u00a0There are a lot of postings on this site if you want to check the archives on gastroparesis, but I'm not sure if the viral gastroparesis you mentioned is the same problem or something different.I wish I had some answers for you.\u00a0\u00a0All I can suggest is to continue to seek treatment for her and don't stop until you have an answer and some help for her.\u00a0\u00a0I know how hard it can be to see them suffer, so I hope you find an answer real soon!",

            "answer": "Please don't take this the wrong way, I'm just throwing it out there.Is there any possibility of pregnancy?\u00a0\u00a0I'm saying it because over the last 25+ years I've been a labor and delivery nurse, I've seen more than a few pregnant 13 year olds--some who aren't discovered until they present, full term in labor. The parents are always shocked, and these are generally children from middle to upper class backgrounds.You obviously know your daughter, and I'm not implying that she is pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Just asking if that possibility has been explored.I hope she feels better soon, and that the gastroenterologist has some ideas for you.",

            "answer": "Dear macmom03,My son has had gastroparesis for four years and your daughter does seem to be presenting some of the same symptoms. I am not a doctor and can't help you with medical advice, but I can suggest that you ask her doctor about doing a gastric-emptying test that can confirm gastroparesis.I am wondering about the fact that her doctor heard bowel tones, which from my own experience says that her stomach is moving. During my son's episodes there are no sounds of movement coming from the stomach. Gastroparesis causes the stomach to slow or stop moving food through. While I know about gastroparesis, I am not as familiar with post viral gastroparesis. I can only recommend that you keep fighting to get to the bottom of this until your daughter is properly diagnosed.I am glad that you are seeing a specialist and we would love to hear what you find out. Please keep in touch and we will help in anyway that we can.My best,dm",

            "answer": "I'm not a medical professional by any stretch of the imagination, but I have to tell you that many of these symptoms are identical to those I was experiencing personally.I posted a thread the other day detailing my personal case where, after experiencing symptoms that were nearly consistent with those that you lay out here, I was eventually diagnosed with adrenal insufficiency. I hope that this post doesn't become too long, but I've been dealing with a guy who I believe is probably the most brilliant doc in this country, and he's helped me learn about a lot of this, so I thought I should share it.After my cortisol and ACTH tests came back abnormal, he put me on oral cortizone therapy that helped these problems subside within two weeks. Outside of developing higher blood pressure from the medication, I felt really good.Thereafter, for whatever reason my Endocrinologist decided to test for TB, which came back positive. Before prescribing antibiotics, he tested me for a fungal infection called Candidiasis. If you were to look up the symptoms of Candidiasis and TB, they are pretty close, so I'm guessing that's why he did it.The test for Candida required a skin sample, a blood test, and this might sound a little gross, a sputan sample, as well. Two of these three tests came back positive, including the blood test for AB's. He told me that the standard blood/fungal culture test is very unreliable, so you have to test for each disease possibility individually, I guess.Here's another interesting issue that he discussed with me that he's actually writing a book about-One of the biggest problems for diabetics is wheat (Grains) and dairy, which plays right into the hands of Celiac Sprue, a GI related condition they are finding among several Type 1 and 2's. Thankfully, my test came back negative for this one, but Celiac Disease is another possibillity that you might want to look into with your daughter.Anyway, Acidophillus is a bacteria that is put into all of the dairy and grain crops pretty much. Outside of a select few veges and fruits, the organism is almost solely related to the dairy and grain crops. They use Acidophillus on these crops because it has a lengthy track record of fighting off several different bacterial and fungal strains, etc, so they're used to prevent the overgrowth of molds and bacterias on our crop supply, etc.If you read about some of today's OTC \"Probiotic complexes\", you'll notice that Acidophillus is in all of them. Several\u00a0\u00a0are marketed as \"Yeast fighters,\" or \"Bowel germ aids,\" etc.But my Endo told me that they are now identifying cases where this \"Beneficial germ\" has actually developed into a GI infection in some individuals that lack Hydrocholric Acid and/or Vitamin B6. In other words, Acidophillus, marketed as the ultimate \"Candida fighter,\" can actually turn against the body in some and develop into a condition called Lactic Acid Bacterial Overgrowth.And this is interesting because it's been a long known fact that diabetic Ketoacidosis can develop into lactic acidosis if not treated promptly. The only forms of lactic acid in the body I'm aware of is that which is produced as the end result of glucose metabolism, and that which is delivered by Acidophillus (or B. Bacterium, Lactobacillus, etc). Considering the fact that diabetics struggle with grains and dairy, etc, you can't help but wonder whether or not a lot of this might not just come together at some point, you know?Of the few physicians that are even aware of Lactic Acid Bacterial Overgrowth, which is not lactic acidosis but a \"Minor league\" form of it, they would know the symptoms are slurred speech, confusion, vomiting, hallucinations, unsteady gait, and visual disturbances-many of which that are observed in actual lactic acidosis, but without the lactic acid # being too high yet.The fascinating thing that he's writing about is that he seems to question whether or not Candidiasis and Lactic Acid Bacterial Overgrowth might not be one and of the same for reasons that I just couldn't really absorb when he went over this w/ me.So the bottomline is that at first he was going to treat me with antibiotics and sodium bicarbonate (The treatment for lactic acid bacterial overgrowth), but my LDL came back normal (Lower 60's), and a vein draw for lactic acid itself was normal, so he just went with two different anti fungal drugs, and I'm not kidding about this-within a matter of just days, I felt like a new person. All of the brain fog, nausea, dizziness/confusion, and the upset stomach was gone, pretty much instantly.The only problem was that I developed a little bit of tenderness around my rib cage, so the doc ran some liver tests for enzymes and Hepatitis, but they came back normal so he said not to worry about it- just a side effect of the medication I guess. Within a month, that was gone, too.At that point, he decided to ween me off of the Cortizone drug. After all of this, the two tests for adrenal function were back to normal. What's that tell you, you know. All of these people sitting out there with chronic inflammation.... In addition, my ANA, which evidently is a test for autoimmune activity, dropped from 140 to 100 or 105, something on that order, which was back into the normal range. Oddly enough, ANA is the marker for systemic Lupus, which again has several symptoms that are very consistent with both TB and Candidiasis-it's not an exact match, but there are definitely some similarities, too.For years and years I had been reading about all of these fungal theories, but I never gave them any merit. The theory just seemed to be a little \"Too conveniant,\" and few of the authors of such theories were actual doctors, so I just tossed the possibility aside. But I've seen the results now, thanks in large part to a brilliant Endo. For years and years this had been developing, but none of my former doctors would ever look into anything. But this guy went right after it, so he's really come as a big gift.Whether or not anything like this might be involved in your daughter's case, I'm not a doc so I have absolutely no idea, but the symptoms would appear to be close to what I was going through.",

            "answer": "Thanks for all your comments!\u00a0\u00a0It is a comfort knowing others have experienced symptoms like hers. I know this is more than just anxiety. It looks like I have a long road ahead and many things to consider, I just hope we get some answers.\u00a0\u00a0She is home again this am, nauseous but no vomiting yet.\u00a0\u00a0My goal is to get her back to school a little earlier each day. About the pregnant thing. I had to ask her in the begining because that is what this looks like. Her response was, \"Mom I haven't even had my first kiss yet!\" Yeah! Her period has come and gone since this all started also. Question for gg-Is your child diabetic? Is it common to vomit like this due to a blood sugar issue? It is strange that your daughter was 13 also, makes you consider something hormonal. My father is Type 2 as was his mother. Some people have told me we should do the 5 hour glucose test. However my ped. doesn't seem concearned about blood sugar. I have looked into many of the conditions mentioned even some of the wheat isues (alot to think about!)but nothing has been diagnosed yet. Hopefully the GI will help. I will ask for the gastric emptying test. One thing I have learned is that you really have to push for tests and answers and it can be very frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for the help!",

My daughter's blood glucose was 910 when they finally diagnosed her(the normal range is 80-120)!\u00a0\u00a0It would be in your daughter's best interest to find out one way or the other, ASAP, if this is a diabetes related situation that you are all dealing with.\u00a0\u00a0The sooner you find out the sooner she'll be feeling better.I wish you luck, hope your daughter is feeling better real soon and hope you keep us informed as to how she's doing.",

    "question": "Hi-For the past 4 weeks my 13 year old daughter has done basically the same thing:can't get out of bed,is dizzy,nausous to the point she vomits 2-5 times,(bile/stomach acids) then gets a severe headache,stomachache,she acts \"spacey\" or \"out of it\",lithargic,I have a hard time communicationg with her. After this \"attack\" all she wants to do is sleep. Once she slept for 5 hours. We have been to the pediatrician many times. First they said virus then when she wasn't better after a week they said possible migraines and ordered a CT scan. It was normal with a little cloudiness in her sinus cavity so he said it must be a sinus infection. 875mg of amoxil 2x a day for 21 days and Nasonex. She has no drainage, not even a sniffle. A week later symptoms are still there and she has now missed 2 weeks of school so I call back and suggest blood work, all of it comes back normal. He says he hears a lot of noise from her bowels/stomach so she should see a gastroenterologist. He thinks possible abdominal migraines with an anxiety componant attached due to vomiting at school infront of friends etc. After talking to the gastro doc my ped. calls me to say that the gastro doc thinks it is post viral gastroparesis so they give her Bentyl.\u00a0\u00a0A few days later still no change so now they have her on Prevecid too. Now we are at week 4 and no change from any of these meds!\u00a0\u00a0We see the gastro doc in a few days but my child is still puking every morning!\u00a0\u00a0For some reason I think it has do with blood sugar, she has always been one to crash if she hasn't eaten. Her fasting level was 86. What do you think?",
