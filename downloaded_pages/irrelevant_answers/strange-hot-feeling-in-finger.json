            "answer": "Hi,Your finger symptom may be caused by Erythromelalgia. It is a rare syndrome in which arterioles of the skin dilate periodically. It results in a burning pain and makes the skin feel hot. The specific cause of the syndrome is unknown. It may be caused by\u00a0\u00a0the use of some drugs, such as\u00a0\u00a0antihypertensives. It may be associated with certain blood disorders, high blood pressure, venous insufficiency, neuropathy, diabetes mellitus, systemic lupus erythematosus (lupus), rheumatoid arthritis, gout, spinal cord disorders, or multiple sclerosis. Erythromelalgia is usually diagnosed 2 to 3 years after the development of the symptoms. Please consult a physician and neurologist for evaluation and treatment. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",

    "question": "I have been having a strange feeling in my index finger recently, it has been happening for a while now. I have been getting a sudden hot feeling that starts at my knuckle and travels down my finger and lasts few seconds. It feels like something has just released some hot liquid ( like a bubble popping) in my finger and travels all the way down my finger. I happens very often throughout the day and has been happening for several months. Its a very strange feeling.",
