            "answer": "After 13 years of being told you can't have a baby, your pg is certain to be an emotional roller coaster.\u00a0\u00a0I have never known anything to affect me emotionally the way infertility has, and I think it takes more than getting pregnant to heal the years of pain, depression and frustration it causes.\u00a0\u00a0Rejoice in your pregnancy and your pregnant body. Make sure that you share your feelings and reach out for help after you deliver too, in case you have the baby blues.I have friends who weighed in under 130 pounds pre-pregnancy, gained minimal weight and still got gestational diabetes, kidney stones, etc...that can happen to anyone, even those who take great care of themselves, which it sounds like you are doing.Take care and enjoy your pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0You lost all of that weight before -- you can do it again!\u00a0\u00a0:)",

    "question": "Has anyone felt depressed since they became pregnant? Here is my story. I have been with my husband for 14 years. WE were told that we could not not have children the entire time (I have pcos). Well about 2 years ago i put myself on a diet and lost 91 pounds!!! Then in October of 2005 I had a miscarriage (didn't even know I was pregnant). It was a huge blow to my heart because after being told I couldnt have a baby for 13 years I lose it. Well just 2 months later I find out I am pregnant again, put on progesterone pills and told not to do house work or anything like that (also quit smoking the day I found out I was pregnant). Well I am no 30 weeks along, found out I have gull stones and gestational diabetes and have put on 55 pounds. I hate myself everytime I look in a mirror and feel so sad all the time. I guess in my head something is going to happen where I dont have my baby. I feel ugly and sad and have never felt this way before. I am sooooo thankful to final be pregnant, so why do I feel so sad in my heart??",
