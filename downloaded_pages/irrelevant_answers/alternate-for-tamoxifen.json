It's got other side effects that are icky, like sore hands and hot flashes, but so what.\u00a0\u00a0I'm alive!Good luck to you.",

All three of my cancers were estrogen-dependent.\u00a0\u00a0Gimme that Aromasin!",

    "question": "Dr. Goodman:I have LMP type ovarian cancer (recurrent) and I was treated with Taxotere. My CA125 came to 9 after 18 chemo sessions from 225. (3 weeks on and 1 week off at reduced dosage). I had a couple of cancer spots in my peritonium and the catscan showed that these patches have disappeared. I am unable to handle chemo due to weakness and inability to eat as food has no taste. My gyne oncologist has put me on Tamoxifen for giving me some protection. It appears that Tamoxifen has caused swelling of my feet which is hurting when I walk. Is there any other alternate to Tamoxifen? I am taking Evista and Actos for diabetes. Thanks for your advice. Regards",
