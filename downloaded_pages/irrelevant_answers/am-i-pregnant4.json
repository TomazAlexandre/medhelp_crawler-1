    "question": "My periods have been like clockwork all my life, 28 days. I have had 3 late periods and it always came exactly a week after. I have had 4 miscarriages recently, 1 in 2010 and 3 in 2014(Jan, March and October). I went to see a doctor on Nov 24 2014 and he prescribed metformin for me even though I did a diabetes and glucose testing and I am not diabetic. He thought my blood sugar was high. I took it for about 2 weeks but didn't like the side effects so I stopped.\u00a0\u00a0After the metformin my periods have been extremely late.\u00a0\u00a0. I get tired easily; I pee at least 8 times a day. My last miscarriage was September 5th 2014. my next period came 37 days later on 10/11/2015, I bled very little, the next one came 11/16/14 37 days late , next one came on the right date which was 12-13-14; 28 days. my next period was 01/27/15 which was 46 days,\u00a0\u00a0around the same time, I had a very\u00a0\u00a0strong metallic taste in my mouth for 3 days ,I spotted for 3 days then in got another spotting on 03-12-15 also 45 days for 3 days. I only saw I was spotting if I wiped when I went to the bath room. All HPTs say negative but I am currently having cramps like I would if I had a period and it\u2019s been about 2 weeks since I had the 'period'. Could I be pregnant? I get nauseous sometimes but breast is not tender.",
