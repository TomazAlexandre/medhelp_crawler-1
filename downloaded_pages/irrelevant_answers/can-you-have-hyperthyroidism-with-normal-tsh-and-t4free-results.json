    "question": "Hello, for the past year and a half I have been experiencing numerous symptoms of hyperthyroidism that came out of nowhere.\u00a0\u00a0I had anxiety issues 10 years ago and it felt like they all came back 10-fold, but I have not been anxious about a thing.\u00a0\u00a0I saw a therapist for a while and she said she was certain there is something physically wrong with me, as my symptoms don't seem to be triggered by anything. Since July of 2012, I have been so hot, to the point that just taking out the trash or doing very light housework makes me feel like I'm going to be sick.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had tremors since this time, as well as anxiety, insomnia, sweaty hands, and recently heart palpitations.\u00a0\u00a0The heart palpitations and tremors have been really bad lately. Today I was so shaky and my heart was pounding so hard that I went to urgent care and was tested for hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I have had so much blood work done in the past several months, all of which has been normal.\u00a0\u00a0(I don't have diabetes or hypoglycemia.)\u00a0\u00a0I had my gallbladder removed last month and as I have still been having a lot of nausea and pain, my surgeon did a liver function test.\u00a0\u00a0My ALK PHOS was slightly elevated (though I am obese), as well as my MPV.\u00a0\u00a0I've read that one cause of both of those levels being elevated is hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if it is possible to still have an overactive thyroid with normal test results.\u00a0\u00a0Here are my historical values:TSH:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 4/27/2013 = 1.45\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10/25//2012 = 2.16\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 5/16/2012 = 1.10\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 9/7/2010 = 2.14T4-FREE:\u00a0\u00a0 4/27/2013 = 1.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 10/25/2012\u00a0\u00a0= No Test Performed\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a05/16/2012 = 1.1\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a09/7/2010 = 1.01",
