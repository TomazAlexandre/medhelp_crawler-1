            "answer": "My DD is living proof that that is not an issue. How big you are NOW does not affect weight of the baby. It is a combination of things, a few of which are: weight of mother at her birth, weight of father at his birth, weight gain of mother during pregnancy, development of conditions such as gestational diabetes, etc.So in answer to your question...no , size difference cannot lead to a problem pregnancy.",

    "question": "I have read that certain kinds of genetic differences between a man and woman can cause complications with pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0For example, incompatible blood types can lead to miscarriages.\u00a0\u00a0But what about genetic differences in body size?If a small woman gets pregnant after having sex with a large man, is there much risk of a difficult childbirth or miscarriage?\u00a0\u00a0I am 6 feet 3 inches tall and weigh 198 pounds, while my girlfriend is only 5 feet 3 inches tall and weighs 123 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0If she gets pregnant, is there much chance that the fetus will be large and difficult for her to deliver, or that she will miscarry?\u00a0\u00a0If so, maybe it's not a good idea for us to have kids.\u00a0\u00a0If not, how big of a size difference is too risky (if there is one)?Thank you.",
