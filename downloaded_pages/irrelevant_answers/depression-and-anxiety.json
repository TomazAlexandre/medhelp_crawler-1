            "answer": "Hi there...I know diabetes is a very very hard thing to have, my mother has had it for 10 years, and my sister has had it since she was 10..she is 22 now....to have to always check your sugar level and eat everything in very light portions is so hard..Maybe do you think she is identifying w/diabetes too much? some people who have a disorder or disease then start to identify with it, and think that it is THEM, and live their lives around that and only that(my mother actually has the habit of saying, \"I need to take care of MY diabetes\" and gives it more significance (sometimes)) ...Maybe she needs to see everything she IS ..a great person, loving, unique talents, unique qualities, and point out to her how with these very things she can help others and be/feel more connected at any time..and it might make her see herself in a new light to give meaning.Does she like movies, or writing, or gardening, something that lets her know and feel all the time that the part of diabetes is not her entire life, or essentially her ..(maybe that is why she is depressed?) I'm not sure if this may help out at all...i wish her the very, very best and hope she can find happiness as I'm sure she maybe has in the past at some point..good luck and maybe see you on here again....",
