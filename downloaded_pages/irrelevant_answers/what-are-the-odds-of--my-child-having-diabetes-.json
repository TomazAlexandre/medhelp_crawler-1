            "answer": "In general, if your wife has type 2 diabetes, the risk of your child getting diabetes is 1 in 7 if she were diagnosed before age 50.People with certain rare types of type 2 diabetes have different risks. If she has the rare form called maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY), your child has almost a 1-in-2 chance of getting it, too.There is a FREE online book by Dr. Laura Dean called \"The Genetic Landscape of Diabetes\". This book provides an overview of the current [2004] knowledge on genetics of type 2 diabetes. Well worth the read!You cannot prevent the gene from being passed but can insure your child doesn't pick up bad habits of eating too much animal fat, foods laden with sugar, sugary liquids, and bad simple carbohydrates. Instead your child can focus on eating more fiber, fruits and vegetables, fish and lean meats and poultry, if carnivorous.",
