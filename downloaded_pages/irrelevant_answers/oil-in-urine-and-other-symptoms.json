            "answer": "P.S. ~ The bloating could be due to food allergies or intolerances. I have learned that many people with fibro, CFS, autism and some autoimmune disorders do better on a gluten free diet. You may want to try going without any gluten for at least 2 weeks and see if your symptoms disappear.Best,PlateletGalCo-CL in the fibro/CFS and EBV forums",

            "answer": "Yes, just days before the \"oil\" in my urine started they did a urinalysis and checked for diabetes.I don't know what CFS is.Regarding treatment for fibro, the doctor put me on Neurotin..(didn't seem to help) and told me to go get pain counseling..which pretty much upset me. My pain is real and if he knew what I felt he certainly wouldn't tell me to go talk my pain away. The attitude he had really made me question that diagnosis, the man didn't even do an MRI of my spine.Next week going to the gynocologist to make sure nothing is going on with the one ovary I have left.thanks for responding,Beth",

            "answer": "Hi, I also get these jolts. For me, they come whenever i have eaten yeast, glutamate, mushrooms, vinager and to a less extent also wheat and oats. Maybe small symptoms also from milk. I also have an oily surface of my urine. Only visible when looking from a sertaint angle so maybe not so much oil. My urine smells really much tuna if i eat canned tuna and i think it is the oil smelling. I also get cracking joints from eating all of these things, a really \"wierd\" symptom the doc cant figure out. The jolts come when i go to rest, especially 1 hour after eating these things, the cracking also comes 1 hour after. If feels a bit like looking into one of those old days chemical flash.. WHAM, and it feels a bit like the brain is moving inside the head. SOOO freaky feeling. The vibrating thing you describe sounds like what people trying to experience lucid dreaming experience before \"floating\" away. I used to have that quite often before but not anymore. The vibrating thing i mean. It stopped after i started eating magnesium supplements, im not sure that that is what made it stop, but magnesium is also good against twitching, so.. Bloating can be a sign of candida and i am pretty sure i have candida. Please check if you get these jolts from eating yeast / mushrooms by eating it and then lying down to rest afterwards. It is the best way i can think of to test it.",

            "answer": "The one treatment for migraine not mentioned is motionlessness, and sugar. :-)\u00a0\u00a0Migraine and migraine-like symptoms often occur after exercise or stressful events. Oliver Sacks's book in no way overstates their variety.Shocks occur in migraine (and other neurological disorders as well). Gabapentin induced a, loud, electrical buzzing noise in my head upon awaking the first week.My hearing is very poor in my right (migraneous) ear. Once, when leaving a large, crowded restaurant, something different happened: I could focus my hearing as clearly as I could my sight: I could focus on a table 100 feet away and hear only their conversation, blocking out voices elsewhere as soft, 'white noise'. This embarrassed me, so I left quickly.Outside, my friend had to stand almost 20 feet away and whisper to prevent moderate to severe pain in my ears. This lasted about 10 minutes, and was followed by migraneous throbbing. The strangest aspect was how his voice changed as he approached me: it became louder continuously until he reached a critical distance. At that distance there was a high-pitched squeal, as an on old P.A. system used to create when the microphone and speakers came too close.Despite the similarity of phenomena, there is no similarity (I know of) in theory. Having had various jobs in my specialty, and finishing my doctorate in a physical science, I did what most scientists do when confronting observations that don't fit theory: I pretended they never occurred.This little anecdote might offer a nice example of how really strange 'migraine' is.",

            "answer": "Abeth, Although my above anecdote may appear 'in apropos' to oil in urine & electrical shocks, it's not. I forgot to mention that, though my diagnosis was 'concomitant temporal-lobe epilepsy and classical migraine', upon moving West my 'migraines' became very severe, 4-day combined events.My urine began to look like diluted milk. Letting it sit in a test tube showed the oil floating on the water-rich liquid. (A wild card is the furniture. Though I couldn't smell formaldehyde, falling asleep on it gave me terrible nightmares.)\u00a0\u00a0All the miseries listed by others here became so common, I considered them part of a single syndrome. Much has been learned in 20 years; and you might consider browsing in the neurological literature for similar case studies. Best & kindest wishes for you all.",

It would help if you check with a neurologist to rule out possible neurological causes. A Fasting blood sugar also is indicated for diabetes diagnosis. This may be helpful if a urinalysis was done previously. Take care and hope to hear from you soon. Warm regards.",

            "answer": "Some of the symptoms you mentioned are the same ones people experience when they have a tumor on or in their adrenaline glands. If I were you, I would go to another doctor and get checked for it. This usually consists of some blood samples and urine tests. If it turns out negative then it would put your mind at ease and rule out a possible cause to some of your problems. If it turns out to be positive then you and your doctor can take it from there and hopefully bring an end to some of your symptoms.",

    "question": "I am new here so I apologize if this is in the wrong place or if I come off sounding like a hypocondriac so soon..*blush*But I am having ongoing symptoms and seems the doctors can't put them all together so some input would be very appreciated.First I am having \"oil\" in my urine. I tell my family this they look at me like I am crazy. Excessive thirst and occasionally excessive hunger, a starvation feeling. Frequent urination, but could be due to the amount of water I have been drinking..days before the oil in my urine started I had a urine test which was normal, and I had a diabetes test at the same time, normal, gullbladder also normal.I am a bit overweight,not much, but thought I should mention it. The last couple weeks however when I look in the mirror I keep noticing I am loosing weight..( I don't have a scale) Now I want to loose weight, but not if it is because I am ill..I would rather be overweight and healthy.I am also experiencing bloating at times as well, where it looks like I am pregnant. Back, hip and leg pain, sometimes severe. I suffer from migrain headaches that are excruciating. And generally don't feel well, not every day, but 3 out of 7 I would guess.Also twice I have awoken to an electrical sensation in my head, litterally felt like a jolt. First time in my head, second from my spine to my head. Vibrating, tingling in leg/foot. Twitching pinky, and twitching muscles in legs.Just seems like all these things are coming on out of no where and I am a bit freaked.More info, have had a partial hysterectomy four years ago, also a few weeks ago diagnosed with fibro,(don't know if I am buying that one.).Sorry if I added \"symptoms\" I shouldn't have, but didn't know what may be pertinent. Anyways if you could point me in a direction or relate to any of this stuff I would very much appreciate it.",
