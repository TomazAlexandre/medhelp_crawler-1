            "answer": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your concern for your boyfriend.\u00a0\u00a0Many people who have had diabetes for a long time go through stages where they rebel against the disease, so what he's going through is not unusual.\u00a0\u00a0It's a concern if he's not doing what he should to properly take care of himself.\u00a0\u00a0Gaining weight and having lows aren't necessarily bad things, and lows unfortunately happen no matter how tight your blood sugar control is.If I could suggest anything, I'd say to not be overly negative when you talk to him about it.\u00a0\u00a0Be supportive, tell him you want to learn, want to help, and want to be involved.\u00a0\u00a0If you try to tell him how to manage his diabetes, he will likely not appreciate that, and it may become between you.A properly treated low can be recovered from fairly quickly, so getting out and doing activites isn't a bad thing.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure he checks his blood sugar again in an hour to ensure his blood sugar comes back up to normal.\u00a0\u00a0Offer to exercise with him, that can be a bonding time for you as well as getting him healthier and feeling better about himself.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hi JD.My husband of almost 12 yrs has had T1 since he was 15 yrs old. I was in your exact position at one time. It's great that you're concerned and want to learn as much as you can, that is the best advice I can give you. Knowing is everything. This website is an excellent place to start.You may want to try to find a diabetes support group in your area. In my area, most of the groups are targeted at older adults with Type 2 (or pumpers), but in these meetings they do discuss the very basics of the disease, as well as\u00a0\u00a0eating plans and what kinds of foods to stay away from, etc. This could be valuable information for you, being new to the disease.Even though he has had this disease for many years, he's always going to have to deal with it. And that will make him cranky, depressed and stubborn at times. It goes in spurts for us. It's possible he just doesn't want to be alone after he's had a reaction. He wants life to be as normal as possible, so going to the store makes life normal. Special treatment puts the spotlight on him and this disease that he can't get rid of.Also, there are specific counslers or therapists that deal with people who have chronic diseases. My husband is supposed to be scheduling an appointment with one... which reminds me I need to remind him!\u00a0\u00a0:-)\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, this might be something he could look into through his insurance. They could recommend someone for him. This disease is tough, it's daily and it's never ending. That would take it's toll on anyone. There's no reason for him to feel ashamed or like he's not strong enough. We all need someone to vent to.When is the last time he visited his Endo? Does he have a current Endo? He should. They can adjust his dosages better and possibly help him figure out what's causing the weight gain -- he used to exercise, now he's not, that could be it?Do you know how often he checks his BS levels daily? He really should do it several times a day. My husband does it before each meal and at his snack times. As well as when he just feels off. So, 6-8 times a day.Well, I've rambled enough. I hope some of this helps you. Good luck and keep in touch!mlz",

            "answer": "Sometimes people's concern feels overbearing to a long-time diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0People have so much misinformation that their suggestions and concerns are often meaningless.\u00a0\u00a0I know that you just mean well, but I noticed that you wrote that you think he should rest after a hypo.\u00a0\u00a0But if he has raised his blood sugar, there is no need to rest, and being told to rest would personally make me feel misunderstood and also babied.\u00a0\u00a0So please follow the advice other people have given you about learning as much as you can.\u00a0\u00a0And good luck!",

            "answer": "I know exactly what your'e going through! I am in the same position. I have been with my boyfriend for about 6 months ut we were friends before that so I knew about hos Diabetes but now I am with him i want to know as much as possible. I have been with him a few times now when hes had a hypo and im lucky ive researched cos i wouldnt have known what to do otherwise whihc is a scary thought! He doesn't like to talka bout it and it does affect a lot aspects of our relationship. I think he tries to act as normal as possible and can eat at funny times and doesnt check his sugars enough I don't want to be a nagging girlfriend or let it get in the way either. The things we do for love eh!",

    "question": "I have recently moved in with my boyfriend of 6 months and he has Type 1 diabetes. I have gotten used to the injections, etc quite easily but am slightly worried about him. He does not stick to an eating plan (misses breakfast, etc) and has stopped exercising since we returned from holidays 6 weeks ago. He explained that he has been \"playing with his levels\" lately to better control his injections, or something to that effect?He was diagnosed at 6 and is now 27 so I can hardly tell him what he should and shouldn't be doing. However, I've been trying to research it as much as possible and want to know if anyone has some tips on how I can help him. He has just been very moody lately and is extremely sensitive about the whole 'diabetes issue', especially because he has put on some weight in the last few months. Sometimes he will have a hypo but is too stubborn to just rest afterwards and will instead go grocery shopping (or whatever) with me even though we both know that he feels like ****.Am getting very desperate as I am worried that this might come between us. If not the moods, then definitely the stubborness!Thanks in advance,JD",
