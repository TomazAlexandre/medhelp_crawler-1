            "answer": "Hello,Excessive thirst is common after eating salty and spicy food.This is because salt which contains sodium and chloride,the body uses water to flush extra sodium away and hence one feels thirsty.There is no proven remedy as such which can be a remedy for excessive thirst except water ,but it has been found that adding a wedge of lemon or orange peel, a sprig of mint or\u00a0\u00a0fresh coriander to water helps a lot. Drinking plenty of non-caffeinated fluids, such as tender coconut water, fresh lime water, butter milk or milk shakes also helps.But if the symptom of excessive thirst persists then diabetes has to be ruled out.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing or\u00a0\u00a0if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "I'm one of those lucky people who can eat almost anything I wantand not gain weight.I like pizza and other moderately spicey foods.\u00a0\u00a0Three or fouryears ago I noticed that after eating pizza I could not stopdrinking water.\u00a0\u00a0I would feel an almost unquenchable thirst.Usually, it takes a couple of hours for this massive thirst tosubside.\u00a0\u00a0As a result, I'm afraid to eat anything spicey.This is not indigestion or an upset stomach.\u00a0\u00a0Except for thisunnatural thirst, I have no other symptoms.It would be wonderful if I could take something that would allowme to eat foods like pizza again.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps there is an herbalproduct that would neutralize whatever spices are causing myproblem.Any suggestions would be appreciated!",
