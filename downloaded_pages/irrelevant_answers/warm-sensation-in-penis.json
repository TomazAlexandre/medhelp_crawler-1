            "answer": "Hello,First possibility for such a sensation is prostatitis. Other causes which can cause such symptoms are an allergic reaction (say to body lotions, condoms, soaps etc) or it can be a skin condition like eczema, dermatitis etc or it can be a fungal infection. Other than that it can be a simple bacterial infection or balanitis. Get yourself tested for diabetes as presence of this can cause mild infection. If all these are ruled out then a peripheral artery disease (by dopplar ultrasound) and a peripheral nerve disease will have to be looked into.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "First of all, I don't think this is penile cancer, but couldn't find a topic that fits! Second, yes I'll go to my doctor if needed, but I'm sure this is likely nothing.Here goes: I am 49 years old, in top physical condition, married and neither one of us have ever had sexual relations with anyone else. For the past month, I have been experiencing intermittent WARM sensations in my genitals, mostly penis, but also my scrotum. It feels like a sudden warm blood rush down to that area, which lasts for about 5-8 seconds and is now happening 12-14x a day. I experience no pain or discomfort. Also, this warm sensation isn't external, only internal. Prior to this starting, I was getting the identical sensation in my fingertips.I can't find this particular symptom on Web MD or anywhere else. I take Concerta for ADHD, but don't see this as a side effect. This is just a really weird thing, kinda like targeted male hot flashes. If there is any data on this or ideas on what it is or what I should be looking for or doing, it would be much appreciated!",
