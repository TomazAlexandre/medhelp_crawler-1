From what I understand, the baby will get a tad bigger if we don't control/watch our sugar levels. I don't have much knowledge as I'm still waiting to get that darn phone call. Don't panic mama, we'll get through this. I'm sure some of the ladies on here can give us both better information. Sorry that I'm not much help.",

            "answer": "I am also gestational diabetic and it scared me super bad as well!! But let me reassure you that the finger pricks aren't that bad and if you do need insulin the needle is so small that most don't even feel it. The hardest part for me was the diet change. But I've made it into a reward for after the baby is born my husband is bringing all my craving food into the recovery room lol! Basically nothing to really worry bout for baby because ur under doctor care. They just wanna make sure baby doesn't get HUGE making it hard for delivering.",

            "answer": "Yea, initially I was scared and couldn't even keep my composure on the phone both times I was told that I failed my test. I was more scared for my baby than myself and went straight into panic mode. Because I know very little now, I barely eat, which isn't good. Lizzie, I'm new to this so you aren't alone. Jazz, do you eat the Chia seeds? And how often do you check your sugar levels?",

Just pray it will be okay this is my third child so nothing worries me much. Just remember not to eat or drink anything before your test even the night before eat healthy and dtink plenty of water.",

            "answer": "@candy_t no I haven't tried chain seeds... haven't even heard of them.. what do they do? I was so freaked out when I first found out that I couldn't eat either in fear I was hurting the baby. But that was the worst thing I should have done. I pick 4 times a day. Which sounds awful but I'm so used to it now that it is gonna feel weird to not do it later hahaha@lizzie_campos the reason we get gestational diabetes is because of the placenta. The doctors explained to me that the worse your sugars get.. needing more insulin.. shows a healthy placenta. Therefore the diabetes should clear up within hours of delivery!\u00a0\u00a0Yay!As far as diet changes.. your gonna look for sugars that your body digests slowly. Like whole grains.. Brown rice.. green leafy veggies.. cheese and nuts are great. So is milk and low sugar yogurt. Your proteins should be roasted or grilles as opposed to breaded and/or fried. Once your diabetes is confirmed ask to speak with a dietitian (which I fought kicking and screaming bc I didn't think I needed) but they will help so much with understanding your new diet and why.I know that it's hard to eat bc your worried right now but your baby needs you to.\u00a0\u00a0If the doctor thought there was any danger to baby they would have asked you to change diet now.",

He said its the highest he's seen in a long time and even said I might even need insulin!.. I'm scheduled to go for a retest today and he says for sure I'm diabetic so I will need treatment. I'm so scared , never been thru this before. What happens to baby with this? Anyone else going thru the same ?",
