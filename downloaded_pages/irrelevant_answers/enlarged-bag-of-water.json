            "answer": "The technical term is polyhydramnios. Are you diabetic? It is one of several common causes of polyhydramnios and the cause of why i have had it for 4 pregnancies. One of the biggest concerns is the ability of the cord to be able to float below the baby's head and get compressed when you go into labor and your water breaks. Mostly, as long as doctors are aware that\u00a0\u00a0the condition exists, they will monitor baby closely.",

            "answer": "I unfortuntly have c sections. With my first, i was induced because of the polyhydramnios. My labor didnt progress probably due to baby's position (sunny side up) and the fact that she had a large head (97th percentile for newborn). Anyway, my second baby came just 10 months later and I was not comfortable in the risk of a VBAC, plus, his head was over the 99th percentile. I have friends who had polyhydramnios and delivered vaginally and without complications.",
