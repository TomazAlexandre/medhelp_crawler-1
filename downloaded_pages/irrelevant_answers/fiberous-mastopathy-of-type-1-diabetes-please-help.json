            "answer": "Hello Whispers,Your condition sounds like agony -- made worse by the stress of spending your energy fighting the insurance company.I have mastopathy, but not to the extent you're suffering with.\u00a0\u00a0I read on another board of a young woman who did get two mastectomies because of her very painful and active mastopathy.\u00a0\u00a0She will soon be married and is looking forward to her spring wedding.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly, she has found a special guy, who adores her.Fighting the medical board of an insurance company will likely require an well-respected medical person to take the lead.\u00a0\u00a0Understandably -- but sadly, we patients are not \"heard\" the same way that medical colleagues can hear one another.\u00a0\u00a0I've done some reading on mastopathy but haven't come across anything that recommends treatments for the more severe cases such as yours.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still looking.\u00a0\u00a0This article was one of few that're available in full text even to us non-physicians (none of us here is a physician):http://care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/25/1/121Another potential source of support, good ideas, and referrals to specialists who can help you deal with your insurer is to reach out to the JDRF Online Diabetes SUpport Team.\u00a0\u00a0There's a link to that \"sister initiative\" on the main page of this JDRF Forum.\u00a0\u00a0The Online Diabetes Support Team, unlike our very public forum here, is a place where you can exchange emails with a JDRF volunteer who's aim it is to connect you up with appropriate resources in your local area.\u00a0\u00a0JDRF sponsors both our forum and the online diabetes support team as ways to reach out to fellow diabetics in need.Do check back, as we all look for info to help you further.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, perhaps you'll have even better luck with our ODST site.",

            "answer": "Dear whispers,I am so sorry for everything you are going through. It sounds not only very painful, but so frustrating dealing with your insurance company. Although none of us are physicians or attorneys in this forum, we are volunteers who deal with type 1 diabetes in one way or another. I agree with LRS's advice and would only add that you speak with your physicians office to see if they can recommend an advocate to help you work your way through the insurance system. I also hope you contact JDRF's ODST program.Please let us know what you find out and how you are doing.My best,dm",

    "question": "I am a 27 year old woman.\u00a0\u00a0I have had Type 1 Diabetes for 20 years.\u00a0\u00a0Last year I noticed a lump in my right breast and immediately went to my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He sent me to a surgeon who did a biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0It came back negative for cancer so he believed that it was fibrosystic disease and tried several medications none of which worked.\u00a0\u00a0The one lump was getting larger and another had appeared and then one appeared in the left breast.\u00a0\u00a0Still he was sure that it was fibrosystic disease and wanted to try using male hormones, I said no.\u00a0\u00a0I went back to my regular doctor and explained it to him, he referred me to a breast surgeon.\u00a0\u00a0I had a mamogram and an ultrasound done.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor performing the ultrasound immediately asked if I was a Type 1 Diabetic of at least 10 years, I said yes and she knew what this was, Fiberous Mastopathy of Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It is very rare and very painful.\u00a0\u00a0The lumps have taken over my breast tissue and my breasts have shrunk from a b cup to an a.\u00a0\u00a0My surgeon has stated that there is no way to save my breasts unless I want to keep them the way they are now (hard as rocks, literally, and so painful that most nights I don't sleep).\u00a0\u00a0But my insurance company has denied the claim, it is not \"medically necessary\".\u00a0\u00a0I have appealed the claim and was again denied, this time because there is no history of breast cancer in my mother or grandmother.\u00a0\u00a0But if I do happen to develop breast cancer, it would kill me before a diagnosis would be made.\u00a0\u00a0There is no way to see through these things to the little tissue I have left. I don't know what to do, if anyone can help please do.",
