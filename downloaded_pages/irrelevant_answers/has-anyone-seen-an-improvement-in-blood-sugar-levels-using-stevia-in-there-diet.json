    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. My doctor put me on Metformin 500 milligrams.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been checking my blood sugar fasting levels in the morning and they always stayed between 100 + 108. I\u00a0\u00a0wanted to get my blood sugar levels below 100 but was unable to. That\u00a0\u00a0what is until I started using stevia in my diet. Stevia\u00a0\u00a0is an all natural sugar substitute which comes from a plant in South America. There\u00a0\u00a0are some studies out there( although the studies are limited)\u00a0\u00a0that shows Stevia has an effect on blood sugar in a positive way.\u00a0\u00a0I started using stevia for about 3 days now. For 2 days already my blood sugar fasting levels in the morning dropped to 94 and 95.\u00a0\u00a0Does stevia have anything to do with it? So far I think my research is inconclusive as I have not been using Stevia long enough to determine this.\u00a0\u00a0however I am watching this closely. Has anyone noticed a positive change in their blood sugar level using stevia?",
