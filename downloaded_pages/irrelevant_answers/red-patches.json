Also back in december i had a yeast infection somewhere else and well i was given zithromax and i had an allergic reaction to it so thats why i think i got the first one and then in february i got really sick with being super dizzy and a cold\u00a0\u00a0and i was given nasonax and it did not help so i stopped using that and then in march the oral thrush appeared after i drank a lot the night before for my birthday. I do not drink a lot only on special occasions and now i am thinking i shouldnt drink at all b/c i can not drink light beer without getting drunk super fast. I dont like to drink either.",
