            "answer": "I agree with the above response.\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted you to know that you sound very supportive and even if your daughter doesn't tell you, she appreciates it.\u00a0\u00a0I have been diabetic for 27 years and sometimes you get down about it.\u00a0\u00a0I never really went to a group or camp for diabetes and I think I should have, I probably would have been healthier mentally and physically.\u00a0\u00a0I kept everything inside and never really talked about my diabetes to anyone.\u00a0\u00a0I now volunteer on this site and talk about diabetes and take really good care of myself and am proud how healthy I am and like to share rather than hide my diabetes with others.I had a supportive mother, who did the best she could and I appreciate everything she did for me.",

            "answer": "Dear Mom<Take great precaution when allowing antidepressant medication to be administered to your child at this age. I have had type 1 diabetes for 30 years and can tell you that with type 1 diabetes you need to keep very busy and exercise with the right diet or you will get depressed. Drugs are not the answer. She needs special attention and a secure feeling of being loved this will change everything. Keep her occupied and her mind off herself. Help people or something like that if she is not working. It will work wonders. If that does not work then try antidepressant medication for only a short period, but do not go over 1 year at her age.",
