Have been testing at home and 2 hrs past meals they have been on the high side and my obstertrician said she would possibly give me another test at 34 wks. Sounds like yours could have been a stuff up in reading results tho, like they were overlooked maybe??",

Trying to look at the bright side and that they saw it before something could have gone wrong. Also, good thing I didn't eat/drink before my visit to be the human pin cushion.",

    "question": "So far I have had two sugar tests. The first one in January came back great. I had to have a second test, due to my age; who check was completed March 17th. When I came for a routine visit on April 3rd, I was told the test was great at a 125. However, at today's appointment I was told I need a three hour test because the last one was inconclusive. Has this ever happened to anyone else? I'm confused.",
