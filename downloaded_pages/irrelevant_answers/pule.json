            "answer": "No it is too high for a resting pulse. I would see your doctor. How is your bp? Do you ever feel like your heart if racing or beating funny? It could be Tachycardia. They should do a EKG then a 24 hour monitor that wear at home. That would tell if you have an irregular beat or if it goes way up at night. My resting pulse is 76 and that is high for me but I'm out of shape.",

            "answer": "Sounds like you need to find out if you have an arrhythmia and/or tachycardia. Again, first get the EKG then the 24 hour monitor should help figure that out. Your family practise doc will send you to a cardiologist to get it put on. They may also have you do an echocardiogram to look for structural problems. Most likely it is an electrical problem. I have one too but it is benign. Also as for the blood sugar being low after eating you may have hypoglycemia. You need to follow up on that. The BP is high as well. So hopefully they can lower it by diet and figure out what is going on. Let us know how it goes.mkh9",

        {
            "answer": "You can also get an irregular heartbeat from low blood sugar. I don't know if a high pulse is part of this as well. So, I would get the fasting blood sugar drawn and they may have you eat or have a glucose solution and wait two hours and see if your blood sugar drops too low or they can check your hemoglobin A1C which can also determine if you have diabetes or low blood sugar. hemoglobin A1C is becoming more popular. I tend to like to stick to the well known blood sugar test.mkh9",
