            "answer": "Hi,The most common cause for yeast infection is living in a humid environment.Water leak in the house where you stay, the season being rainy, not ensuring the cloths you wear are pressed and dry -\u00a0\u00a0all these can cause an yeast infection. Other causes can be using common toilets as in hostels or sexual contacts with persons already having an yeast infection or even exposure to plants and trees supporting fungal growth. It is also important to clean the head of the penis on a daily basis and keep the whole area and undergarments clean and dry.Once affected, usage of anti fungal creams for the duration specified by your doctor is important. Sometimes the source of yeast infection may be internal to the body, the common one being candida yeast. In such cases, external application will not cure the disease and internal medicines will be required.Solace",
