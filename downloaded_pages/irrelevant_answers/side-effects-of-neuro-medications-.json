            "answer": "You're welcome. All medications come with some side effects, most people can tolerate them, some cannot. If you do not have the paperwork a call to your pharmacist is in order. Before taking any new medication you need to be aware of side effects which require immediate medical attention. Also, make a list of other drugs and supplements you are currently taking and ask about drug interactions; when 2 or more drugs are taken whether one diminishes/cancels the others usefulness and/or creates a negative side effect.And, great work on reversing your diabetes state back to NORMAL. You deserve many pats on the back!",
