            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The symptoms that you have enumerated point more towards spinal nerve compression at the cervical vertebral level. It is common in computer users. CT scans and MRI need to be done on the neck. Please consult an orthopedic specialist for this. Sleeping in wrong posture, overuse of computers, and neck sprain as in a jerk or car accident can all cause similar symptoms. A good physiotherapist too can help.You should also look at the possibility of these symptoms being due to diabetes and hypothyroidism.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
