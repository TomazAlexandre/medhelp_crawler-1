            "answer": "The thyroglobulin test is an antibody test to see if your body is attacking your thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0High antibodies are often a sign of an autoimmune disorder (meaning your body's immune system is attacking your body).\u00a0\u00a0In the thyroid world there are 2 autoimmune disorders - hashimoto's which causes underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and grave's disease which causes overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism).\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully the other blood tests they are doing now are to test your tsh (thyroid stimulating hormone) as well as the amount of actual thyroid hormone in your body (T3 and T4).\u00a0\u00a0If you tsh is high that means your body doesn't have enough thyroid hormone and the tsh is being pumped out by the pituitary gland in order to stimulate the thyroid to make more.\u00a0\u00a0On the other side if your tsh is low it means that you have too much thyroid hormone so the pituitary gland stops making as much tsh in order to make your thyroid cool down a little.\u00a0\u00a0There are other causes of both hypo & hyperthyroidism (being postpartum, nodules, too little iodine, etc).\u00a0\u00a0If your additional labs come back abnormal I would recommend finding yourself a good endocrinologist and make sure it's one that cares for a lot of people with thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of endocrinologists do mainly diabetes care and they aren't really good at taking care of thyroid problems (I found that out the hard way).\u00a0\u00a0Once the doctor determines if you have a thyroid problem and whether it's an overactive or underactive thyroid they will then discuss treatment options with you.\u00a0\u00a0There is medication for both overactive & underactive and depending on whether there are any nodules in the thyroid or a goiter (the thyroid itself swelling up) there are other treatments for that as well.Are you having any new symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms of hypothyroidism include dry & brittle hair, fatigue, mental fog and weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms of hyperthyroidism include hair loss, lots of soft stools, anxiety, unexplained weight loss and palpitations (feeling like your heart is beating out of your chest).\u00a0\u00a0It's important for any person with a thyroid problem to have any treatment or medication adjustments done not only based on lab results but symptoms because it's not uncommon, especially in women, for symptoms to be present before the lab values match up.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps you some and welcome to the board.Oh, and do you have any other autoimmune disorders (ibs, fibromyalgic, etc)?\u00a0\u00a0If you have one it's not uncommon to later develop others.Rayne",
