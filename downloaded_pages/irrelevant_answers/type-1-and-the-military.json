    "question": "I am in the USAF and am 20yrs old i was recently diagnosed with Type 1 and had a blood sugar of 863. My A1C test test showed I had been around 600 for the past 4 months or so.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if anyone had any experience dealing with this while they were in the military. This is all so new to me and unexpected because no one has diabetes in my family. I am in excellent shape i weigh 175 and am 5'11''. I am a flyer in the AF so I can't fly anymore and am expected to be discharged. If you have any info please help.",
