            "answer": "Here are the main problems.First, being 6 he has no idea that his mood swings are related to food and how that effects his behavior.Second, all of us young and old ( I am 43) but especially the young NEED to take in carbs to have the energy that we need to carry on for the day.I was never one to want to eat breakfast in the mornings as well but once I started I never went back.I will let you draw your own conclusions as a parent but I would say forcing it would have dramatic improvements in behavior and in energy and that would be a preferred trade off to a small episode in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0And I believe that after a while it will become a very good habit and the episodes will fade and go away.Sometimes being a parents means forcing kids to do the right thing.Hope that helps some ...Kevin",

            "answer": "Hello, Phil.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It's rather hard to use logic and reason on a 6 year old, isn't it.\u00a0\u00a0You don't mention the insulin therapy your son uses (such as Lantus/Novolog or using the pump), so it's kind of hard to give a lot of detail.\u00a0\u00a0From the insulin perspective, skipping a meal isn't a bad thing, but it's not good, either.\u00a0\u00a0As long as the basal rate is correct (and this gets into the Lantus/pump issue), then not bolusing for a meal shouldn't make a difference.\u00a0\u00a0I know the research says that to start the day with a healthy breakfast gets things going better, as you note.Have you considered a reward or incentive for eating breakfast?\u00a0\u00a0Kind of counter-intuitive, I know, but if he can get into a pattern of eating breakfast, and then you can show him how much better he does, that might help.\u00a0\u00a0You could also have it come from him.\u00a0\u00a0After he has breakfast and perks up, have him draw of picture of how he's feeling.\u00a0\u00a0Have him do the same on a day when he doesn't eat.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully one is a happy picture and the other is a grumpy one.\u00a0\u00a0That should help him understand the difference from his own viewpoint.",

    "question": "Hi,Our son (6 years old) has Juvy Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We found out about 5 months ago and have battled the food intake, calculations, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors say we have done an amazing job keeping him under control...(Thanksgiving was wild though).Anyway, our son does not like to eat breakfast when he gets up.\u00a0\u00a0We have pretty much forced him to eat something because when he doesn't eat he becomes very whinny, emotional, and causes a disruption in class as the teacher has to stop what she'sdoing to check sugar levels, etc.Our doctor says to let him eat what he will and leave it alone.\u00a0\u00a0That's all fine and good, however, he doesn't get the midday phone call from the school and also doesn't have to contend with the emotions from our son when his sugar drops.\u00a0\u00a0Like I said before, when he starts down this path it seems to get worse as the days go by.When we have forced him to eat something he immediatly becomes a happier child after the food kicks in and is more astute and a happy child at school.My question is this, should we be forcing him to eat something for his carbs or should we just let it be what it will be.Thanks for your response.Phil",
