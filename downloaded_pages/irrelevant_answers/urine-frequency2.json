            "answer": "Hi!If it is indeed Staph infection then you need to ask doctor if it is MRSA\u2014this infection can persist for years and needs rigorous treatment. Other than this, you need to get blood sugar tested as diabetes too can cause an infection to persist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
