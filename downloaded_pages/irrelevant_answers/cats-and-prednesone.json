            "answer": "hi and welcome to our forum. your poor kitty sounds like he has alot going on and still he's very active. STEROIDS are NOT good for cats. they can lead to many long term problems, even 1 dose can lead to DIABETES in cats.Is the Vet prescribing this for some sort of pain control, for inflammation?\u00a0\u00a0There MUST be a a very good reason for wanting a kitty to take this medication.I will send you a link to a website for more info on side effects. keep in touch.http://www.marvistavet.com/html/prednisone.html",

            "answer": "I hate to say this, but it sounds as though your cat has multiple conditions, infections, and inflamations and possible cancer that is affecting multiple internal organs.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect the prednisone is to help delay symptoms and pain by managing the inflamations.\u00a0\u00a0In most cases, steroids are not advised long term, but in this case, it could well be the best course of action to prolong kitty's life and keep him comfortable.",

            "answer": "I agree about the steroids.\u00a0\u00a0My cat's vet insists that cats process steroids differently than we do.\u00a0\u00a0Well, anyway, I couldn't afford to take the cat back to the vet check up that is required to get the prescription refilled.\u00a0\u00a0I do think my cat is better off with me just giving her 1/4 tablet of Zyrtec in a day when her allergies are bothering her the most.\u00a0\u00a0So, I'm not even giving it to her everyday.\u00a0\u00a0This is in line with what I do for myself with the antihistamine I use for myself.\u00a0\u00a0One can develop too much tolerance for the antihistamine if one doesn't take a break from using it, so I'm applying this same thing to the cat.\u00a0\u00a0I generally do natural health as much as I can for myself, so I'm doing what I can to follow the same thing for the cat.\u00a0\u00a0She is actually doing better with just the Zyrtec and diet change.My vet wanted her to take the steroid for allergies.\u00a0\u00a0I gave it to her before, but I don't think it made enough difference to risk her long term overall health.Anyway, I do agree that steroids are not good for cats.\u00a0\u00a0However, if kitty has a long term illness, such as IBD or cancer, then giving the cat steroid medication is like palliative care and makes the kitty much more comfortable.",

Because he is on wet, special diet food, it recurrs.\u00a0\u00a0He is healthy otherwise, but the way his internal organs have shifted forward,\u00a0\u00a0he could die suddenly at any time.\u00a0\u00a0 I do brush his teeth with a Q-Tip and special cleaner the vet has given me,\u00a0\u00a0but eventually he becomes uncomfortable again.Again, thanks for the link",
