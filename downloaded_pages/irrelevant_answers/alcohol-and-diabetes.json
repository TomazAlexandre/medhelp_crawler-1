            "answer": "Dear soccerplayer73,This is such an important question and I do thank you for reaching out. I am a volunteer and not a doctor so I am unable to give you medical advice, but we all have experience dealing with type 1 diabetes. My son is 28 and was diagnosed at 8.Your honesty is wonderful and the fact that you are asking shows that you are concerned about your own health. Having said that, my concern is for anyone drinking at any age (even a few times)who is missing the buzz from drinking.Your friends do have a right to be concerned about drinking with type one. Alcohol is processed by the liver and while it is proccessing it, the liver cannot release glucose to the blood stream. This can cause a very severe episode of hypoglycemia. Unfortunately, I have heard of too many incidents of drinking and hospitalizations.I know that you have said that you check your blood sugars and feel straight when you drink, but believe it or not, it will alter your thinking and can prevent you from recognizing a low blood sugar coming on.High school and college are tough years to get through, especially with type 1. I would encourage you to look at a few websites:www.childrenwithdiabetes.comThis is not just for young children, but older teens and adults as well.www.jdrf.orgPlease look for more responses here and let us know how you are doing.My Best,dm",

    "question": "Well I've had diabetes for about 5 years now and I'm jus about 17 now going into my junior year and I want to drink and get the drunk feeling. I've only done it a few times now and every time I've gotten drunk I still remember to check my bloodsugar and can think completely straight too. I know that when you drink it slows down your kidneys for distributing glucose so your bloodsugar can go low just depending on the type of alcohol... Well besides the age law, I'm not completely sure if its really 'that' unsafe if I can be able to check myself on a regular basis and not over drink to where I'm passing out?.. I also have my friends who actually rather me not drink b/c they're scared for me, but since I do sometimes choose to, they know what to do if something ever happens and how to help me so we've all talked about it too..",
