            "answer": "I am not a doctor just a fellow myopic from germany.1. If your myopia did not increase in the last years it should do so in the next years.2. Highly myopic persons are among the most threatened by blindness.3. It is known that excessice near work deteriorates myopia in childhood and adolescense. At your age this should not be a problem any more. Nevertheless I would recommend you to put your screen near a window to be able to look outside frequently to relax your eyes and focus on a point far away. Put your screen not too near but at an intermediate distance.4. Have your eyes checked regularly and whenever you have a change in vision.Long myopic eyes are subject to retinal tears and retinal detachment.Try to keep your eyes free from anything which can be harmful: injuries, high blood pressure, diabetes etc.5. I don't think there is a best permanent solution. We will just have to wait and see.PS: To my knowledge small retinal holes do not always need laser surgery. Maybe you want to get a second opinion?",
