            "answer": "Hello, the pace of progression of cataract varies from person to person. Progression of cataract is also affected by a number of factors like exposure to UV rays, diabetes, use of medicines like steroids, vitamin deficiencies, and conditions like glaucoma, eye injuries etc. Hence, the only advice that can be given is to have your cataract removed when it begins to affect your daily activities. Good luck with your vision!",

    "question": "I am a 54 female - I had a childhhod cataract develop in my right eye at age 6, then glaucoma in that eye at age 13.\u00a0\u00a0Surgery back then was a big deal for cataracts, so I never had it done.\u00a0\u00a0I did have successful glaucome surgery which has kept my eye pressure down - until about two years ago, when I went on Xalantan for it.\u00a0\u00a0It has kept the pressure under control. I have had no vision in my right eye since my late teens.Recently, I have developed a cataract in my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0My left eye has been very healthy with no problems, although I do have significant floaters in that eye.\u00a0\u00a0My retina is checked regularly and the interior of that eye looks good. But, last fall I had significant blurriness, so went in and my prescription changed a bit - due to the cataract. Now, my vision has again become blurry which is likely due to the cataract.\u00a0\u00a0I know I need a new prescription.\u00a0\u00a0When should I have cataract surgery - and how fast do cataracts typically progress?\u00a0\u00a0I am alarmed I have blurry vision again so soon after the last correction, which was my first in about 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your input.",
