    "question": "Hi all,Can anyone suggest a common cause for all these symptoms in an otherwise healthy 26-year-old female? I'm aware that some of these things may mean absolutely nothing or be unrelated to the rest, but I'm going to include everything I can think of to be sure.Frequent headaches since childhood.Headaches occasionally accompanied by dull, pulsing pain in fingertips.Headaches presaged by dilated pupils in one or both eyes.More recently, headaches sometimes accompanied by visual disturbances in one or both eyes.Damaged vision (has not recovered fully from severe headache about a month ago); more noticeable at some times than at others, and eyes can fluctuate as to which is worse.Uneven pupils all the time.Right pupil no longer round but elongated; this is also the eye with most marked change in vision.Problems with memory. Factual memory is fine (in fact, often very good) but episodic memory is exceptionally poor; I often remember a conversation but can't remember who it was with, or remember seeing someone but not where and when. The memory is there when someone tells me what to look for, but it's like I can't access it on my own. I'm reluctant to ask for help with this more than I have to because it's embarrassing, but even asking about as little as possible has been enough to worry my partner and family - and I would guess that for every partial memory I ask about, there's another ten or twenty I don't ask about.History of depression, characterised by oversleeping, overeating, withdrawal, apathy and unwarranted guilt.Various tests - usually for different things like my appendectomy, heavy periods and a knee op! - have shown cystic ovaries (causing no major problems) and slightly low thyroid function. No diabetes, no known allergies, minor intolerance to wheat but I just avoid eating it, plenty of exercise and I eat a healthy diet including multivits and minerals so deficiencies seem unlikely.Apart from the gammy pupil my eyes are apparently healthy - no problems with retina, optic nerve etc etc. My decrease in vision has been noted, but seems to be causing concern to no one except me!Can anyone suggest anything that might link these symptoms?Thanks!",
