            "answer": "Hello,Without examintion,confirmation of a diagnosis is tough,but there are various possibilities for your symptoms.It can be due to allergic contact dermatitis,atopic dermatitis,sweat dermatitis,candida infection,peripheral nerve damage,neurodermatitis and obstructive biliary disease. Internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions tochemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy underarms.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Pregnancy can lead to rash, fungal infection or even dermatitis. You can apply local creams as it will not be advisable to take oral medicines. It is difficult to comment without examination.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult a skin specialist regarding this. Keep the area clean and dry and you can use medicated talcum powder too.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "White Male; Mid 20sI have had this problem for 3 years:Every now and again, one of my armpits will get itchy (usually the left, I think). If I give it a scratch, the internal area becomes sore, almost like I have torn a muscle.There is no rash, redness, broken skin, ingrown hairs etc, I don't sweat a huge amount and I can't really find a lump (especially not one that hurts). I don't think I've been lifting anything. When I lift / strech the arm up there is disomfort but I struggle to pinpoint exactly where in my armpit the pain is.As I say this is normally in my left armpit, but I can't guarantee it hasn't happened in the right armpit either.I know this sounds weird, but any advice would be great. Any ideas?",
