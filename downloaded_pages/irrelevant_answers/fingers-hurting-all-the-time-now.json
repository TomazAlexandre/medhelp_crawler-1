            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Since small joints like those of your fingers are involved, it could be rheumatoid arthritis. Typing for a long time,that is if you have been typing for a number of years, can cause pain and stiffness to appear at any time. It can also be due to osteoporosis. Hypothyroidism too can cause joint pains. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you. My mom has oseoporosis pretty bad. I had wondered if I should get a bone density test but I don't want to keep bugging the doctor for tests or they start to treat you like you're a hypochondriac, you know? She also has Hypothyroidism, Diabetes and heart disease. She's not the healthiest person. It does make me wonder how much could be genetic. Anyway, thanks again!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Hypothyroidism, diabetes, heart disease and osteoporosis, all have a genetic composition. Also both diabetes and hypothyroidism can aggravate osteoporosis. Please test for these as you have a very strong family history. Also take care of your nutrition and eat a healthy balanced diet and exercise regularly. Menopausal age is very vulnerable to all these problems. Hence please test for these diseases once.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I noticed my fingers are hurting, feel stiff and feel puffy, although I can still wear my rings. I do use a computer but I don't think I'm typing anymore than I've ever done before. Why are my fingers hurting all the time now? Is this arthritis or something? What would help?",
