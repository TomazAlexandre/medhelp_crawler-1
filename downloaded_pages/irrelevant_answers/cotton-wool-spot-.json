You cannot contact HIV from a eating utensil used by an HIV + person.Cotton wool spots are caused most commonly by diabetes and hypertension and in younger people by some blood and autoimmune diseases. Heavy smoking in a young peerson and \"shooting up\" with heroin like drugs can be a cause. They can occur in healthy persons \"for no good reason\" they do not effect vision and eventually go away.Your retina specialist hopefully will give you good results on all your tests.",

    "question": "Hi,About 5 days ago, I began noticing a semi circle when my eye is closed and occasionally a flash.\u00a0\u00a0Upon examination by opthamlomologist, he noticed a cotton wool spot in my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0He referred me to a retinal specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Retinal specialist did not seem worried, and said the tests look ok, but referred me for a bunch of blood tests just in case.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, I am 24 year old female, which is why the doctor referred me to a specialist, since this is apparently uncommon for someone my age.\u00a0\u00a0In researching this to death, I saw that HIV is also a cause.\u00a0\u00a0I am married and monogomous and last hiv test was 9-06 negative.\u00a0\u00a0About a month ago, I believe I ate food that was contaminated with an HIV pos person's fork. Could this be a symptom from this event?\u00a0\u00a0Or do you believe the cotton wool spot is idiopathic, considering i do not have diabetes or high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0 I am scareed, awaiting test results.Thanks",
