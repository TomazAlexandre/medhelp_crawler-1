            "answer": "Viral load can flucuate quite a bit - up or down. At this moment you could have a vl of 3,000,000 or 800,000 and it wouldn't be particularly significant. It would be nice if you could have a test the day before tx, but if your insurance won't pay and you don't have the spare $500 dollars to pay for it yourself, I wouldn't worry.If your next PCR is at 12 weeks into tx, the only thing you have to worry about, as a geno 2, is whether you're detectible or not.Do some reading in the archives of this site. If your doctor is only looking for a two log drop at 12 weeks it sounds like you could soon be teaching him how to treat. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Or, your viral load might be lower than the test result when you begin treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Viral load can vary over time.\u00a0\u00a0You cant't assume that it is always going higher.\u00a0\u00a0As a geno 2 you can safely assume that you will have a 2 log drop in three months. In fact, if you have any detectable virus at all after three months you probably have an issue.\u00a0\u00a0Just make sure that you are dosed correctly and stay on the med schedule.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, not all doctors require a biopsy before treatment. I find it interesting that the insurance company does.",

            "answer": "Well, if ya gotta have HCV genotype 2b is the easiest to treat.\u00a0\u00a0First thing I did when my genotype came back g2 was thank God for being a genotype2 instead of the much more difficult genotype1.Most Geno2 have a high starting VL. We are very lucky and usually respond well to INF tx.Mine was 7 mil, another buddy of mine was 20 mil.\u00a0\u00a0We both were und by wk 4 (rapid viralogical response).Don't worry about fluctuations in your baseline VL numbers at all. For a geno2 it means almost nothing at this point. 70% of us geno2's get RVR (und by wk 4 ) This is what your short term goal should be. Make sure your Dr gives you a 4 wk VL test and not just the 12 wk.You have statistically have a 80-90% chance to beat HCV with the current drugs available.The best thing you can do NOW (before tx starts) to insure a good response (RVR) from Interferon and riba treatment is get your weigh (BMI) in the normal range.Reading your profile its not clear if you have Diabetes or your other listed interests.Make sure your not IR and get your Diabetes under control if you do have it.Sorry to say, Diabetes, IR and overweight are predictive factors for poor response.IMHO, If your DR ok's it, get going now if your BMI if it is not normal. Bring your weight down in a healthy way as much as possible before TX...Post your bx results here and we will try and help you interpret them, if needed.Are you seeing a Hepatologist ? That might be best with your other conditions, since they could complicate things.There are no Dr here, the best thing is talk to your Hepatologist about all of this.apache",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Chronic Hep C Apx. 4/17/2009, genome 2b with a viral load 1,880,000 (6.27)\u00a0\u00a0I understand I will be doing 6 month treatment (Peggylated Inteferon and Ribivirin) , I have not yet started treatment as of 6/10/2009 , I have a liver biopsy scheduled 6/17/2009 , I believe my insurance company will not \"Pre-Authorize\" treatment for the inteferon and ribivirin\u00a0\u00a0until the biopsy is completed. My dilema is that my Doctor would like to see a 2 Log drop in my viral load numbers after 3 months of treatment to show I am responding to treatment, but I haven't even started treatment yet and I believe from 4/17/2009 (my initial\u00a0\u00a0viral load 1880000) could have replicated and be a much higher or lower ( I would assume higher) number. So a 2 log drop from 1880000 would be an ending result of 10000 in my blood, BUT if the original viral load of 1880000 incresed from 1880000 to WHATEVER it is as of today , and I start treatment sometime after the biopsy6/17/2009 with a higher #---- then a 2 log drop from THAT # may not be 10000 that the doc was looking for, but may actually be a 2 log drop from the increased #.\u00a0\u00a0 I have heard that you initial #s are good for 3 months(Dosent make sense to me maybe I heard it wrong) Looks like I lost before I start,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0ANY FEEDBACK.",
