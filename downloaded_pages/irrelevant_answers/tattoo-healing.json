            "answer": "Hi daidai,As a woman with several tattoos, I can tell you we all heal differently...and different tattoos may take more time depending on how large the piece is and how deep the artist went. If you've been washing it several times a day and keeping a nice layer of A & D ointment on it after each washing, it should be fine. Remember not to scratch if you can help it and certainly don't pick at the scabs. I have a large tattoo around my lower leg that took several months to heal. You should be just fine as long as you've been taking good care of it =) Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Indeed, healing time for one person differs from another person. It is important to keep the area clean always. It is normal to experience itchiness in a newly tattooed area but try to avoid scratching because it can also prolong the healing process. The presence of diabetes and other medical conditions may also contribute to the delay. Take care and best regards.",
