            "answer": "Hi,The way I understand your urinalysis showed rbc numbering at 3-5 /hpf and the normal reference for your laboratory was less than 3? Is this correct?Were you able to visibly or grossly note bleeding in your urine?In other laboratories, urine RBC's numbering up to 5 may still be acceptable. So I feel that in your case, this may be a mild case of microscopic hematuria. In the presence of mild hematuria,other factors have to be noted like bacteria and WBC levels. You have also negative crystals and casts. This may offer some relief.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that a CT scan of the kidneys ,ureter and bladder be done just to rule out any structural disorders involving the urinary tract. At this point, I do not think there is anything to worry about. A hemogram may also help as this may note the appearance of the red blood cells. RBC appearance and character may suggest the origin of the bleed and if there is underlying kidney disease.How old are you?Have you been diagnosed with diabetes?Any associated symptoms like pain in urination or increase in urinary frequency?Inflammation and infections may cause hematuria. With this, your fasting blood sugar and blood pressure levels as well urine protein levels should also be determined. Asymptomatic hematuria may be influenced by stress and strenuous exercises. So during a repeat urinalysis ,it is important not to engage in any strenuous activities.",

            "answer": "I am 21 this year and not diagnosed with diabetes.From the report I see, the bacteria has a nil result returned.My WBC level is 0-2 and the ref range given is <6. Therefore, i think WBC is not the cause.The doc I saw describe to me that the kidney act as a filter which filters all those toxic stuff. And since he said my kidney might be suffering from inflammation, the kidney could not prevent the blood from escaping and he said this should not be the case as RBC are thick and should not pass through the filter. But he told me not to worry.Any advice?",

In your case, looking at your urinalysis results does not seem to suggest something urgent. The red blood cell is mildly elevated but all other factors are within normal range .Your protein is negative and there seems to be no underlying infection.Drink adequate amount of water and engage in mild low impact exercises such as swimming.You may opt for a repeat urinalysis within a month just to see if the hematuria persists.

Other forms of insulin resistance conditions may also be caused by autoimmune and genetic factors.\"In all types of diabetes there is a balance between geneticand environmental factors, but as in other diseases, genesplay a greater role in patients with a younger-onset fortheir diabetes. This is clearly seen in Type 2 diabetes.There is considerable evidence that genes, as well asmajor environmental influences like obesity, are importantin the aetiology of Type 2 diabetes. Children and siblingsof patients with Type 2 diabetes, who share 50% of theirgenes, are 3\u20134 times more likely to have Type 2 diabetesthan subjects without diabetic relatives.\"Source:http://www.ias.ac.in/currsci/feb102002/273.pdfA diagnosis of diabetes has to be established.

Diabetes needs to be diagnosed based on blood tests .The urinalysis only suggests the condition but is not the gold standard for diagnosing diabetes.Diabetes is only a differential here which means it can be one condition that your physician will look into since it may help explain the high sugar levels in your urine. Diabetes and its types do have their respective forms of management. It is not the time of detection but the type of diabetes which influences therapy and management. Early detection of diabetes helps in managing the disease properly.In a way, your physicians are assuming\u00a0\u00a0diabetes here until this is proven otherwise.
