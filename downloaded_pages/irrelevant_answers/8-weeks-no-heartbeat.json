    "question": "I am overwhelmed with sadness right now.\u00a0\u00a0I should say before anything that I am 26 and have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0After 5 years of trying to get pregnant I finally found out that I am.\u00a0\u00a0I should be 8 weeks pregnant right now based on the u/a done 2 weeks ago @ 6 weeks they did a viability u/s and found my babies heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0When I went for a check up today they couldn't find the heartbeat and the u/s says that I am 7 weeks 4 days. I'm very confused but most of all I can't stop crying just thinking that I may not have this baby.\u00a0\u00a0I have another u/s next week and I am praying to God that they find the heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0We really want this baby.\u00a0\u00a0Especially my 5 year old.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep me and my little one in your prayers.",
