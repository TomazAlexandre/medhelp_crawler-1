            "answer": "If your blood work is coming back normal and your doctors don't think there is a problem than I think it is pretty safe to rule out diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0How about hypoglycemia?\u00a0\u00a0That is when you have low blood sugars, but not diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There is a website www.hypoglycemia.org that is a very informative site. Maybe if you check it out it will give you some insight.\u00a0\u00a0If you do have thyroid problems you will feel much better when you get meds to regulate your thyroid.

            "answer": "so i finally got it all figured out at the dr's and thought id post it incase it helps someone else. i found out that i have juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. i have a lot of triggers that made my seizures worse. i didnt even realize i was having seizures. my sleep, hormone levels, light, noise and certain foods are triggers. i never even considered epilepsy because i wasn't sure how id know if i was having a seizure or not. now that ive started the medication ive felt so much better. its a slow process but things are starting to get better. good luck to anyone else thats still struggling.",

    "question": "I've had symptoms that started when i was about 14-15. I get headaches everyday around the same time (11a-2p), frequent urination, always tired (take about 2 hr naps every afternoon), dizziness, fainting, tender feet, shakiness(notice it mostly at work after about 4 hrs..gets better after lunch break), weakness, shortness of break, increased sweating, sudden thirst and hunger. Everytime i get a blood test the results come back normal. A few years ago my thyroid was tested and it came back normal. just recently i had another blood test that said my thyroid levels were high and the results are being faxed to my primary dr. so i can discuss them with her. i'm also scheduled for an mri and eeg because i wake up in the middle of the night with extreme stomach pains, ringing ears, dizziness, and usually collapse or faint. i think that at one point i might have had a seizure. this is to test if i have new onset seizure and mesial temporal lobe sclerosis. despite all my tests, diabetes seems to fit more than any other possibility ive heard of so far and i have a gut feeling that i might have it. ( but ive also had these symptoms for about 5 yrs and really hinder everyday activity-so i might just be finding a reason b/c im fed up) any advice?",
