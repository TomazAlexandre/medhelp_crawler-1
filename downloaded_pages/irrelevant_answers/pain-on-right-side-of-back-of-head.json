            "answer": "Hi,There is not a known association between headache and bloating/dyspepsia. Nonetheless there could be another medical problem that may be responsible for both the symptoms. An example could be anxiety. Do you suffer from stress/anxiety/related problems? Do you have any other medical problems such as hypertension or diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0You may want to try out symptomatic treatment\u00a0\u00a0for headaches such as tylenol and antacid drugs as suggested. If the problems persist, kindly go in for an evaluation by the\u00a0\u00a0physician.",

    "question": "Hi,I would like some input/comments/advice on what I am having. It has been a week that I am suffering from a constant pain at the back of my head, on the right side mostly. It moves a little around but always on the right side. The pain can be really intense for a few seconds, then when it goes, I feel a constant pressure in the head. Sometimes it moves\u00a0\u00a0to the front behind my right eyebrow or cheekbone. I have taken painkillers but nothing is working. I saw the doctor yesterday, he gave some herbal stuff. Drops and tablets.The pain can also be burning. I have noticed something. I don't know if it is related but when I have the pain and I apply some pressure with my fingers, I feel gas in my stomach, and then I burp a lot. Every time I feel the pain, I do that, I burp... Even just now, my cheekbone is painful, and I press on it, I burp. What could that be? Please can anyone help? I am finding it harder and harder to deal with. I am at work and it is hard to focus...Thanks for reading and trying to help...",
