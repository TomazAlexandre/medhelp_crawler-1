I would also do a search for 2-butoxyethanol, and look at your cleaning products.\u00a0\u00a0Anything you use that has an EPA registration number?\u00a0\u00a0That usually signals a pesticide (which Butyl is) and I would avoid these products.",

            "answer": "Well that's the thing, I have not received much testing at all. The first time I ever went to a doctor about anything anxiety related was after feeling a numb feeling on the right side of my face, it was at a sporting event in the city and it was just my little brother and I. I've never been an anxious person but from what I could see as reasonable explinations it only seemed logical that it was anxiety. My doctor confirmed this, prescribed xanax and said it's \"probably\" anxiety and to take one whenever I felt symptoms to see if it helped. Like a lot of patients that suffer from anxiety, I felt anxiety over the medication and on top of that, I was a criminal justice major at the time, and filling and/or taking xanax doesn't exactly bode well when they're choosing candidates and doing\u00a0\u00a0background checks. I opted not to take it and just calm myself down. The worst my anxiety ever got was at a school event about two months later, I felt really uncomfortable and had pins and needles type numbness with my entire face. My right side felt kind of weak as well. My fear was some kind of stroke, aneurysm, etc. I was calm and never really lost it but went to the ER to make sure what I was experiencing was just an anxiety attack. They did a cat scan to confirm everything was ok, as the doctor pointed out to me with any kind of stroke the right side of the brain controls left side functions and vice versa but she ordered the test anyway more or less to give me peace of mind. A social worker also came in and discussed what my anxiety could be from and really all I could even come up with was money, being a college student it puts a stress on anyone's wallet, but I've never been one to really sweat not having a lot of money. I have a very good summer job so anything I put on credit I'm confident will get paid off soon enough. We both came to the conclusion I was experiencing anxiety from anxiety. A second run in with my general practitioner for what they determined was irritable bowel syndrome (without tests, they prescribed the librax and said if it doesn't help that we'd have me go to a gastrointestinal specialist. it did help, a lot, and on top of that I never had any blood of mucus in my stool..). And that's really been it for doctors and tests.Today I played soccer for about 45 minutes to an hour, I'd say 30 minutes in I started feeling the pins and needles tingling on my head and felt pretty dizzy. Again, I've never actually fainted, I didn't really even feel like I was going to lose my balance, but I left and also had blurred vision. And the thing to keep in mind with any sport is this is the one thing I've always been able to just turn off my brain completely and play, and it's the same way until I start to feel any of these symptoms. Since then I've had a pretty bad headache. Still working on finding a doctor up here...it's a small town without a lot of doctors that want new patients apparently. I'm going to call both my insurance company and the hospital here to see what they can do for me in finding a doctor.",

    "question": "Hi,Since about a year ago I've had a handful of weird physical symptoms, and everything the doctors have come to conclude has been related somehow to anxiety. I'm currently taking Librax(Chlordiazepoxide and Clidinium) for what they think is Irritable Bowel Syndrome and it has relieved those symtpoms (diarrhea, frequent bowel movements, irregular bowel movements) for the most part.Recently I've felt new symptoms:Dizziness - It's a weird dizziness. I don't have any problems walking, I've never fallen and I've even played sports while feeling this way and been fine.Dry Mouth - It's a side affect of librax but I feel it often, even when it's probably worn off since taking it last.Trembling - This has only happened to me once where it was real bad, and it was after exercise. This is the biggets reason I'm posting this in the Diabetes section. My hands were shaking to the point where i could barely meet my drink to my mouth, my mouth was extremely dry during this time even though I had drank plenty of water all day, and I felt dizzy at this time too. It was after playing a game of touch football, which was a solid 30 to 60 minutes of exercise, mainly sprinting.Sharp pains in my head - I get these very quick, sharp pains in my head, mainly at the top of my head, in the back. They don't happen frequently enough where I'd be that concerned about it being an aneurysm or something of that nature but it still worries me nonetheless. I get them on the right side by the temple as well, but even less frequently.Headaches - There are times where I even wake up with headaches. They havent been as bad recently but I've tried to make sure I'm having the right amount of sugar daily in fear of having diabetes...they're usually localized headaches where it only hurts in a certain spot, but its not one particular part of the head, its different most times.Tingling - I get tingling but I don't get it that often in my hands, arms, legs, or feet like diabetes symptoms are described. During exercise I actually get it on my head, the top and back usually. It's a scary feeling.Anxiety - I've had on and off anxiety about things but never bad enough where I've had a panic attack but bad enough to where I feel physical symptoms(tingling in the face, dry mouth, uncomfortableness, feeling a little claustrophobic, wanting to leave to a familiar place like a car or my house, etc.) I always thought I just had anxiety about things for the past year but now I'm starting to think maybe something else thats physically wrong is triggering\u00a0\u00a0the anxiety. The symptoms im experiencing do just cause more anxiety.Blurred Vision - It's not as though I have a hard time reading things or seeing things but I feel like I have to focus harder than I should when I'm looking at something.I'm going to see a doctor as soon as I can but I'd love some piece of mind and some other professionals opinions on what you think might be going on.",
