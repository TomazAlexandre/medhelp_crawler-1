    "question": "Hi i am a 30 year old male who's having frequent an urgent urination problems... i have to go at least 15 time a day an at least 4 times when im sleep. It feel like i have to go bad but when i go not much come out. Some times it slow up like its leaving then its speeds back up. Some times i hurt in my pelvic area. i watch the prostate commercials and i have some of the same like weak stream an it takes me about 15 seconds to urinate. I have been to 2 different doctor i been tested for uti, diabetes, my kidney, and bladder. all come back negative. They check my prostate an say its not large. I took a blood sample for my prostate an they said they was goin to call me if something was wrong, i never got a call. I have been gave antiboics an still dont work. One doctor said i was to young to have prostate problems. i dont drink alot but i did b4 i had this problem. But it all started when i held my bladder for so long, longer then i ever held it to it hurted when i urinate, then i had sex after that. did i mess up something inside of me for doin that?
