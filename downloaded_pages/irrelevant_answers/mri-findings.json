            "answer": "Hi.Your MRI findings are quite non-specific and can be present in many conditions such as migraines, multiple sclerosis, mineral deposition, some chronic neurological diseases, or can even be age-related. It would be premature to consider any of these as your primary differential diagnosis just based on the MRI findings.Have you consulted an ENT doctor to evaluate your dizziness and vertigo? Some ear conditions can actually cause most of your symptoms including the head pain and numbness.A stroke, if present, would have been seen on MRI and would immediately alert the radiologist to it. You should have other possible causes, such as diabetes, hypertension, or other endocrine problems, ruled out by your doctor.Aside from an ENT doctor, you should also have your symptoms evaluated by a neurologist.Good luck.",

    "question": "I am a 31 yr old male and recently had an MRI of the head to evaluate reoccuring dizziness, vertigo, memory and confusion problems, head pain, numbness and tingling in arms and face.\u00a0\u00a0The results were negative according to my doctor, but on the radiology report in the findings it states \"There is a small region of hypointense signal seen along the right medial temporal lobe on the axial gradiant images likely representing some nonspecific mineralization or hemosiderin.\" There is no additional mention of anything else abnormal.What does this mean? I made the mistake of looking it up online and all it mentions is a stroke or iron deposits in the brain, which concerns me.\u00a0\u00a0Should I get e second opinion?\u00a0\u00a0Any feedback would be appreciated.",
