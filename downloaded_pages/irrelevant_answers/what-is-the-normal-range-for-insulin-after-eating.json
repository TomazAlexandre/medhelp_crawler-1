            "answer": "Your prandial and postprandial glucose ranges appear to be normal.Normal insulin values are are 5-20 mcU/mL while fasting. Did you have a C-Peptide test also? Not sure about postprandial insulin results.Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different laboratories. Talk to your doctor about the meaning of your specific test results or get a copy of your lab results. The lab copy will indicate the range levels low to high. Anywhere in-between is normal. Borderline numbers are warning signs.HTH",
