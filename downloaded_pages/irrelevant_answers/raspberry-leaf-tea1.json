            "answer": "I will def tell you what my doc says, but i thought drinking it was completely safe and good for you near the end of pregnancy! Both my sisters drank it from 32 weeks, and they had fast labors (2-4 hours) thanks to that tea! It doesn't bring on labor, rather it helps your cervix soften and dilate quicker when you are in labor. I will update Wednesday and let u know what i get told.",

            "answer": "It should be perfectly fine to drink, usually its reccomended to start from around 36 wks pregnant if your pregnancy is\u00a0\u00a0\"\u00fcneventful\", it helps strenghten and tone your uterus, which helps with contractions by making your uterus work harder and this is what can help shortnen labour, you usually need to drink around 3-6 cups a day, or alternatively you can take the tablets :)",

            "answer": "Well, it is certainly very possible I wasn't given accurate info.\u00a0\u00a0I asked when I was in third trimester in a natural foods store, and she told me not until I was term.\u00a0\u00a0This wasn't a Dr., just a clerk in a natural food store.\u00a0\u00a0I never pursued it any further.\u00a0\u00a0I do think it's always best to check in with your Dr. to be safe, and am glad your doing so.\u00a0\u00a0I'm interested in his thoughts for sure as the topic comes up a fair amount.",
