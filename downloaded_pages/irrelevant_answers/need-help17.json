            "answer": "Hi,Can you please give us some more information regarding your problem?1. Any dryness of the eyes?2. Any features of diabetes?3. Thyroid problems?As dryness of mouth is related to many other diseases, we need to understand what might be the cause of your problems. You might be having Temporomandibular joint problem on right side, so avoid chewing hard food of the right side, chew soft food and more on the left side. Apply some local analgesic gel so that there will be reduction in the pain and finally drink plenty of water.\u00a0\u00a0Any more doubts you are welcome.RegardsOHNS2010",

            "answer": "Hi Rose,Your ENT specialist should make this diagnosis, you can talk to him and explain him about your past history.Also consult an ophthalmologist to check for the dryness of the eyes and can be determined in the doctor's office by testing the eye's ability to wet a small testing paper strip placed under the eyelid (Schirmer's test using Schirmer tear test strips).Salivary-gland inflammation can be detected by radiologic nuclear medicine salivary scans.The diminished ability of the salivary glands to produce saliva can be measured with salivary flow testing. The diagnosis is strongly supported by the abnormal findings of a biopsy of salivary-gland tissue. The glands of the lower lip are often used to obtain a biopsy sample the salivary-gland tissue in the diagnosis of Sjogren's syndromeRegardsOHNS2010",
