            "answer": "Hello,Cramps in legs and calves can be due to overextension of the muscles, overweight, prolonged standing during the day, dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium,calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease(narrowing of the leg arteries which causes poor circulation), sarcoidosis, excess alcohol and nerve compression.I suggest you to get an evaluation done from a physician for these conditions. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi there,I'm a 23 year old female and concerned about pain that I'm experiencing in both legs. It started a few days ago when I woke up feeling as though I had pulled both my calf muscles quite badly, in spite of the fact that I have not been doing any vigorous exercise. The pain took a few days to simmer down, but yesterday after spending about 8 hours sitting at the library I started feeling cramps in my calves. Today the pain is not as severe but it has travelled up to my thighs and my calves are still feeling tender. I am worried because I take birth control pills which I've heard can cause blood clots and also the last time I experienced this kind of cramping in my calves was when I was on an airplane for 13 hours. There is no bruising or swelling which is good, but I'm wondering if I need to go see a doctor?Thank you for your time",
