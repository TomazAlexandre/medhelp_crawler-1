            "answer": "Hello,For any orange color in urine, hematuria needs to be ruled out. Since you are having kidney problems, so any kidney stones may be responsible fro causing blood in urine. You need to get an ultrasound KUB (kidneys, urinary bladder) and CT scan done to rule it out. The most common cause of oily urine is ketones in urine. These appear in individuals with uncontrolled diabetes and also during periods of starvation or a stringent dietary regimen. The other possibility is of Chyle that is produced by your lymph nodes is the reason for the urine's oily residue. This is more noticeable if you left the urine stand for a period of time.Urine analysis may be done to help with the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
