            "answer": "Hi there,Yes there is a diagnostic criteria, its called the Mcdonald Criteria, we have the earlier versions in our health pages, you'll find them just to the right of your screen. We're in the process of putting together the latest version, which off the top of my head didn't become available until 2011.The things to keep in mind is that the number of lesions is not as important as their location, type etc. MS type sx's are not always caused by MS, there are actually numerous mimics eg peripheral neuropathy, diabetes etc you might like to read the health pages on MS mimics, to give you some ideas.Cheers......JJ",

            "answer": "Hi Junebogg,Yes, and no. The 2 lesions you have may not be MS like the doc says, even with MSlike symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Not all lesions are caused by MS like Supermum mentions.Whats important to know is that a regular MD should work on your behalf to identify the cause of your problems (and address the ton of symptoms mention you are having). And, when unsuccessful, should refer you to a specialist that can help.Wishing you well w/getting to the bottom of this. And, I hope it's something that can be fixed, or managed :)-Shell",
