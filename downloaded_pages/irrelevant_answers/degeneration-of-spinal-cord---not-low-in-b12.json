            "answer": "How long had u been experiencing ur symptoms before treatment was sought for them? I'm no dr but it sounds like u may have had ur symptoms awhile before treatment began thus canceling out a full recovery. It does, to my uneducated eye, seem like ur subacute degenerative cord condition has left u with some permament nerve damage. I'm sorry for ur struggles and would be interested in updates as to how u are doing!! *hugs*",

            "answer": "This is exactly what I have. I was diagnosed with copper deficiency and am having treatment for this, but I've been told that I probably have permanent damage and my neuro problems won't improve.On MRI I had increased signal in the posterior columns of my cervical and thoracic spinal cord. My CSF showed increased protein with a positive 14-3-3 protein. My doctor says it's the same as MS but with a different cause.What I'm trying to get at is that maybe you have a copper deficiency too?I forgot to mention that my B12 was almost non existant about 2 years ago but I had the injections and the level normalised and I only developed the neuro problems within the last 10 months. So I don't think there is any relationship between the two.Good luck",

    "question": "I have insulin controlled Type II Diabetes and depression. This is my discharge note after 2 months in hospital:27 year old with a 6 month history of progressive bilateral leg weakness and numbness with a number of falls. Bilateral arm weakness-with tingling.MRI in keeping with subacute combined degeneration of the cord thought secondary to B12 deficiency. B12 levels noted to be mildly reduced on admission.Anti IF/gastric parietal cell abs/coeliac screen -ve. CSF normal. VERS normal. Started on IM B12 replacement and levels improved. No obvious cause for low B12 noted.AXR, OGD and biopsy normal. Small bowel series normal. Received 5 days IVMP with minimal affect\u00a0\u00a0a dose of dexamethasone.Repeat MRI 18/10/10 unchanged from initial study.For the last three months I've been receiving B12 IM injections every two days with no affect. I'm now home for one month. I've started to get a burning sensation in my feet. My legs often twitch. I also have a lot of discomfort in my back. I have also noted sexual dysfunction in that I have no sensation when I ejaculate. I have constant pins and needles in my hands. I'm no longer able to write or play the piano.I'm really starting to question the Sub acute combined degeneration of the cord. Can anyone offer me any advice or differential diagnosis.Thanking you in anticipationDamien",
