            "answer": "I believe you were talking about your depression medication????? So I think your in the right spot Im Bi-Polar but your depression is not something I know much about. If seems that the Depression Community would know more about how they work:) Meds. are always being tweeked It's gest a fack, It's not a science. So If you have been with this Dr. for a while and trust their judgement, then go with it. Sometimes you have enough mood stablizers in your system you don't need anti depressants Hope this helped, the last thing you need is being judged for using the wrong platform (according to some)Blessed Be",

This is a public chat so lets all be friendly and try to help the other one. Looking above you also use some capital letters. I probably should not have posted my original question and had I known it was going to cause contraversy I would not have. I personnally know Freebird227 has been going through alot of stressful situations herself. Please, no further comments from anyone about this situation. We are all human. I personnally thank both of you for responding to my situation. By the way, I took my question to Bi-Polar forum & no one has responded. Freebird227, yes I was talking about my depression medication. Thanks to you both.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed several years ago with Bi-Polar, Social Withdrawal, Panic Attacks, Major Depression. I have Diabetes and Hep C. The list of meds I am on are Klonopin 0.5mg 3x daily, Lunesta 3mg @bedtime, Depakote 500mg x 2@ bedtime, Gabapentin 100mg x 2 capsules 3 x daily, Lexapro 20mg x 2 @bedtime, and Budeprion 150mg 1 tab every morning and other meds for Diabetes. I went to my Psychiatrist yesterday and because I stay depressed all the time she mentioned taking me off the Lexapro but did not mention putting me back on another anti-depressant. Well, she did not do this but stated if when I go back in a month she was going to take me off if I was still depressed. I am throughly confused about all this. Just wondering if you could help explain. Thank you. God BlessPam",
