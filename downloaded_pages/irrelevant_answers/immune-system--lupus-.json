After you email me i will give you my phone # or you can give me yours and I will get her to call you. Yes it is OK to take pregnant because it is a food prduct but i would still ask your Dr. I started 18 months after I had my baby and I took it while nursing, ( I am an extended breast feeding mama), and gave it to her starting at 18months old and my 4 year old. They go to day care and preschool and they stayed well with no flu all winter. Just a little sniffle for a couple days and then gone!Here is my creative way of giving you my email without geting blocked.The first part is OneToThreeBees then do the @ then type aol.com.I Know this will help you. It has had a tremendous effect on 2 members of my family with two other serious illness; advanced diabetes and stage 3 Hodgkins (cancer)Valerie",
