            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed description of the symptoms or a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to comment specifically on the situation. Diabetes may be associated with increased susceptibility to infections and reduced healing power and in a few cases may be associated with neuropathy and decreased vascularity that could lead to the formation of a diabetic ulcer. Management of a diabetic ulcer would involve adequate control of blood sugar level, prevention of further trauma/ extension and appropriate antibiotics in the situation of an infection. It would be best to discuss the situation and the suggested management plan in detail with the treating doctor.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "i been taking gabapentin afterwards lyrica as the doctor pre diagnosed me with diabetes, but the burning is still worst through out the day and night it never stop. i understand that my blood sugar is on dibetes diagnosis. but aside from this situation i got bitten by an insect in 2010 and got huge swelling on my upper forearm and has pulled out a dead muscle from the holes . by this time i went to the doctor\u00a0\u00a0and give me bactrim forte er , doxycicline, and i think ametriptiline it all subside the extreme pain from venom but after i finished taking doxycicline i experience pin prick pain on the affected area and a patchy pepper like kind of burn pain. after a year i start experiencing those kind of pain.i am worried thatit will eventually destroy my leg. and i know i have diabetes but as i observe taking the nerve pain does not remove the pepper kind of pain. so i am thinking it is not the problem. I am thinking that this is an effect of the venom in my blood .I havent went through blood laboratory exam to anylize my blood i just wish to know what kind of blood exam should i take that include a venom or lyme disease problem.",
