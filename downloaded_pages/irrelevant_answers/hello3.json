And when you write that \"people are talking about me and want the worst for me...\" this makes me think you have some paranoia to deal with as well.I strongly urge you to seek professional mental health and deal with these issues now before they take up any more of your young life.

            "answer": "It sounds like you are suffering from Hypochondriasis which is a form of anxiety. Having anxiety in general can make you a little phobic & think irrational thoughts. My anxiety started about your age so I feel for you. Its a very hard thing to understand but you will get through it with proper help & tools. Like Greenlydia said, please see a mental health professional. They can do wonders for you.Best Wishes~C",

            "answer": "you aren't alone in what you experience. i go through the same things and have for as long as i can remember. not so much the paranoia any more. that was there when i was young....around 10 or so. now it's more obessions over my health and dying and aging. as others suggested, therapy is a good idea and maybe even meds. but also using a forum like this to vent and learn about your problems really helps. one of the worst mistakes people with anxiety disorders can make is to believe they are entirely alone in what they feel. obviously that's not true.what do you mean when you say you're positively convinced of an outcome that doesn't even happen? can you give an example?",
