            "answer": "Congratulations! You are so blessed. I recently saw an article about a 56 year old woman who gave birth to beautiful, healthy twins. You sound like you are in good health and take very good care of yourself. Just continue what you're doing and you and you baby/babies should be fine. I'm 41 and just went through an IVF and now they are telling me I'm losing the baby after 4 weeks. How were you so fortunate? Did you do IVF? Any advice would be good for our next try. Thank you and may God bless you with a healthy, full term pregnancy.",
