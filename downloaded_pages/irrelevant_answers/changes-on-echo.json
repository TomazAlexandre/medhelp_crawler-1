            "answer": "It sounds as if you have some right ventricular dysfunction. THis could be secondary to an intrinsic heart problem such as a patent foramen ovale, coronary artery disease, or from severe pulmonary problems such as rheumatological diseases or venous thromboembolism. I would suggest that you speak to your cardiologist to address what test he needs to order to evaluate your right ventricular dysfunction. By the way what were your pulmonary pressures?",

            "answer": "Thanks for answering my question. On the the report I do not see where the pulmonary pressures are listed. It does state that they were not able to assess the right ventricle function due to poor image qualitynor were they able to approximate the right ventricle pressure due to inadquate tricuspid regurgiation. I was told by the neurologist that my heart was enlarged. I have an appointment around Thanksgivng with a cardiologist.",

    "question": "I am a 50 year old female with diabetes, FMD, hypertension and history of TIA's and silent stroke. I also have a family history of heart failure and attack. I recently had a bubble echo to check out my TIA's I noticed some changes on my echo that were not there 6 years ago when I last had a echo doe. THe changes are the following: left ventricular hypertrophy,right ventricle dilated, left and right artrium dilated, mitral valve reuritation, triscuspid regurgitation, IVC dilated and central venous pressure is elevated. With my risk factors and family history I was wondering if this could be the start of me having heart failure or could these by a normal variation. I would be grateful for any help. I forgot to mention I have been a little bit more out of breath.Thanks",
