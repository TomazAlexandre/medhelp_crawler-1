            "answer": "First, there are no doctors on this forum although a medical student may drop by every so often.How did you find out your levels were close to 150? Have you discussed this with a medical professional?With so little information given, I can only surmise thatyou absolutely MUST start making some dietary changes as well as hopefully increasing exercise. Research shows even small amounts of weight loss(5-10 pounds) will decrease glucose, as well as help high blood pressure. Your current glucose ranges are too high and definitely need treatment to avoid complications from diabetes.Be sure to give dietary changes and exercise a good try and stick with those changes. Keep checking blood sugars regularly. Drink lots of water, cut out all sodas and juices.\u00a0\u00a0Stay in close contact with your doctor so that your regimen can be changed if necessary.",

            "answer": "If you are unable to get your blood sugar down with the oral meds you are on, it sounds like it may be time to start with insulin. Twenty years is a long time, and that is a natural progression of the disease, not a sign of failure. 7.7 is too high and you are at risk for complications.",

            "answer": "Hi,a slow death!\u00a0\u00a0It is tough, but the bottom line is that you need to take personal responsbility for your health rather than expecting someone else (the government or doctors to heal you).Weight gain and diabetes is contributed to poor diet and lifestyle choices (even though you can't control your genetics).It is not easy.\u00a0\u00a0but diet (I recommend low carb) and exercise are the way to go.\u00a0\u00a0Read up!\u00a0\u00a0There are many good sources of online information. You have to reach that point of no return when finally you realise enough is enough and you then make the changes that need to be made to control your health and your life.Best wishes.\u00a0\u00a0We are all in similar boats here.\u00a0\u00a0you are not alone.",

            "answer": "I love you dearly, you know that, but I have to disagree with the statement, \"Weight gain and diabetes is contributed to poor diet and lifestyle choices (even though you can't control your genetics).\"Lord knows how many skinny people are plagued with diabetes and even with a very strict diet and/or insulin; their diabetes is very hard to control.\u00a0\u00a0This is the way it was for my grandfather.I totally agree with you though, that if you are overweight, have poor eating habits and little exercise, your diabetes would be very hard to control.\u00a0\u00a0I believe one of your most important lab result, is your A1C levels.\u00a0\u00a0They tell the true story of your glucose control over the past 3 month period.Diabetes can definitely be a silent killer, just as high blood pressure can be.\u00a0\u00a0High levels of glucose in your blood, is like little, minute \"crystals\" floating around in your blood.\u00a0\u00a0These crystals have sharp edges on them (best way I know how to describe it) and they are what causes the damage to your blood vessels.\u00a0\u00a0The smallest of our blood vessels can cause the most problems, if your glucose levels are too high.\u00a0\u00a0Such as the blood vessels that go to our feet.High glucose causes damage to the peripheral nerves, thus causing areas of numbness.\u00a0\u00a0It is most noticeable in the hands and feet.\u00a0\u00a0When this damage occurs in the feet, you are less able to feel if you have a small blister or sore on your foot.\u00a0\u00a0Left untreated in a diabetic, can be the cause of you actually losing your foot due to an overwhelming infection, possibly leading to death of tissue.In the meantime, think about those \"crystals\" doing damage to the vessels in your heart and kidney's, to name two areas.Diabetes is nothing to ignore.\u00a0\u00a0If you are overweight, you must get your weight under control.\u00a0\u00a0You would be surprised how your blood sugar goes down, just by taking a walk.Eating sugar does not CAUSE diabetes, but if you already have diabetes, sugar is something you need to stay away from.\u00a0\u00a0Carbohydrates, like pasta, breads, etc., are the things you have to watch carefully.With extra care and a little hard work, you can control your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Work closely with your doctor and possibly a nutitionist to help you in your quest to lead as normal a life as possible, without having to deal with the silent damage that uncontolled blood glucose levels can do to your body over time.We can't do anything about genetics, as Sally says, but we don't have to give up and quit, either.\u00a0\u00a0You can kick diabetes in the pants and stay on top of this battle.\u00a0\u00a0Never give up.....You can do it.",
