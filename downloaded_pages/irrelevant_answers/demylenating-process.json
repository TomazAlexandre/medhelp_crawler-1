            "answer": "Hello Mike.Yes, Chloroquine is a treatment of Malaria. But I suppose 14 years is a long time. Chloroquine seems less likely to be the cause here.She definitely has more than just Chiari. The demyelination has to be explained. I have not seen any cases of chiari malformation with demyelination.This has to be discussed with her Neurologist.Regards",

            "answer": "Thank you for your help.\u00a0\u00a0Our current Neurologist specializes in MS, but he has said he does not yet believe she has it.\u00a0\u00a0After an appropriate recuperation from the Chiari surgery we will see what symptoms remain.\u00a0\u00a0If they are intolerable, as they are now, he said he would suggest measuring the CSF pressure and analyzing it for possible MS or other cause of the demylenating process.\u00a0\u00a0If you would like I will try to save this thread to give you an update in three months or so.Thanks again for your fine help.Mike Wenger",
