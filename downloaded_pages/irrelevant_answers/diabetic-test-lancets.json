            "answer": "In answer to your question - if there was blood on that lancet and the child or anyone pricked themselves and that blood entered into the bloodstream, yes there is a chance with that small puncture.\u00a0\u00a0It only takes a very small amount of blood.If you'd asked me that question - do you have any diseases I should be worried about? - five years ago, my honest answer would have been no, I don't have any diseases and I would have been honestly wrong, not knowing I had Hep C until 2006.\u00a0\u00a0Particularly with a child, I'd have the testing done simply to be on the safe side as the person themselves might not know their own status.Good luck.",
