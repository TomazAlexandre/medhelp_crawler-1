    "question": "Hello Dr.I have a sad situation...unfortunately, I had an affair last year (2009) that was short-lived.\u00a0\u00a0My husband and I were having major issues (not that that justifies anything I did) and I made a huge mistake!\u00a0\u00a0I have been living with guilt since and trying to overcome that with knowing I will never do that again....(he is unaware of the affair and I do not want to cause him misery by telling him)We (me and the other man) had oral sex (him giving to me) once, and two instances of protected sex, however, I am unsure if the condom was intact the entire time because I never \"looked\" afterwards and we were \"hurrying\" both times.\u00a0\u00a0I believe the last time we have intercourse was in early October of 09.\u00a0\u00a0I never thought too much about HIV because we used protection (IF IT WAS not faulty)...and was trying to work through guilt and my marriage!Then, at the end of Feb. 2010 (about 4-5 months after the last time) I came down with a case of oral thrush.\u00a0\u00a0Of course when I googled it HIV came up everywhere!\u00a0\u00a0This thrush was confirmed by a Doctor.\u00a0\u00a0She gave me Nystatin (spelling?) and it seemed to have gone away, but my stress and anxiety were doubled on top of the guilt I had felt for the last 4-5 months!\u00a0\u00a0I was so scared I not only made one horrible mistake but two by possibly contracting HIV if a condom malfunctioned and I am unaware.Then I began to have fever for a few days, nausea, headache, muscle aches, burning sensation on my tongue and wt. loss due to loss of appetite.\u00a0\u00a0Also food and drinks tasted funny and every day my tongue seemed to get whiter and whiter.\u00a0\u00a0All of this corresponded to Anxiety though so I tried to push HIV out of my head, but with my guilt and all it has been a constant struggle.\u00a0\u00a0I had my first HIV negative test at the end of Feb.\u00a0\u00a0I have had my thyroid tested, tested for diabetes (I am in the Pre-Diabetes stage, but not diabetic) and was checked for Hep B and C, all negative.\u00a0\u00a0I had another HIV test on March 18th (this one was a home access kit USA) and that was also negative.\u00a0\u00a0Yet my tongue kept getting whiter and I kept feeling like I was swallowing things when I would swallow.\u00a0\u00a0I went back to the Doc today and I have oral thrush AGAIN!!!\u00a0\u00a0(I think it has been there for a few weeks but I was chalking it up to dry mouth and anxiety)My questions are:1.\u00a0\u00a0 If all my labs are coming back OK, what in the world is causing this oral thrush?2.\u00a0\u00a0Can I trust my negative HIV results for sure?3.\u00a0\u00a0My Doc said this oral thrush COULD be my body's reaction to the anxiety/stress because it wears out the immune system, but thrush twice in a month?????4.\u00a0\u00a0Could the Nystatin just not have worked completely the first time around and that is why I have oral thrush again?I do not know of any other underlying medical issues that I have.\u00a0\u00a0I have always had one of those immune systems that does not fight off colds if I come in contact with someone with a cold...would that delay seroconversion or delay testing results?I am SO scared and am having a tough time dealing with my mistake and this thrush and the other symptoms.I forgot to mention that this has all left me severely anxious and depressed and I have recently been put on depression meds (as of last Friday).Could you please help me with these questions.\u00a0\u00a0I really need an expert opinion.Thank you so much for all you do for everyone....Very scared and upset,me...",
