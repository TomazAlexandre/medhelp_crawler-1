            "answer": "Moisture has little or nothing to do with warts.\u00a0\u00a0Based on your description, I am not at all sure that every single bump you have is a wart.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than keep irritating yourself with Condylox, I think you should bring any new bump to the attention of your dermatologist for proper diagnosis and treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Warts can of course recur, but not in my experience as often and regularly as you say is happening to you.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect that you are overtreating yourself, and in the process causing yourself needless discomfort and anxiety.Take care.Dr. Rockoff",

            "answer": "Hi,My doctor just recommended Tagament 800mg for two months due to my persistant genital wart. He removed one 8 months ago and I was celibate for those 8 months yet it returned in the same spot. He told me to take Tagament and return for a pap smear in 6 months instead of every three months.\u00a0\u00a0I was told that it will help my immune system and he also recommended I eat cantalope and carrots to benifit from vit.A (not in pill form).\u00a0\u00a0You might want to ask your doctor about this.\u00a0\u00a0I will let you know how it goes.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the suggestion....I went back to my doctor and she stated that they are warts!\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to do it is so fustrating.\u00a0\u00a0I now have about 6 warts in my vaginal area as I'm typing-it is driving me crazy cause I have met a nice guy that I would like to get to know better.My doctor again recommended that I put a tissue in my vaginal area to keep it dry.\u00a0\u00a0I also called the center for diesese control who also stated that my reacurring warts were very unusual-she stated that most people have them once or twice and that is it-how lucky for them!\u00a0\u00a0I tried calling a dermatologist-thinking maybe they will know more but the receptionist stated I should follow up with a GYN and not a dermatologist!I wonder if I'm spreading the virus when I'm cleaning myself during showers or after using the bathroom.I had an HIV test just to see if maybe my immune system was compromised the test was negative.Any other comments or suggestions would be greatly appriciated.",

    "question": "I'm a female and was diagnosed about HPV in college (about 10 years ago)...I always thought it was just a negative pap smear and an increase risk to no bear children (I never knew that it meant genital warts)so imagine my suprise when a a wart appeared about 8 months ago! I have had them every month since then...The first treatment consisted of freezing at my doctors office; however that didn't work and I quickly got tired of going every week.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor then prescribed a condolyx gel(?spelling).\u00a0\u00a0It works but of course the skin becomes irriated and when the wart is gone I have to wait at least another week for the skin to heal (which is annoying cause it disruptes my sex life).I read in a natural healing book that a high dose of Vitimin C, Lystine and B-complex could help; doesn't seem to be working...would you suggest that I continue to take them?Is there a reason why I keep getting the warts?\u00a0\u00a0How can I treat them and not spread them when wiping after urination?Unfortuatly I smoke (I'm trying to quit) and i have type 2 diabetes (blood sugars have been pretty stable)...because of this should I just anticipate to continue to have outbreaks on a more consistet basis than others that don't smoke or have diabetes?Also my genital area stays pretty moist-my doctor stated that that this may have something to do with the continued outbreaks and suggested that I leave a tissue in the area to assist with keeping the area dry-is this true?",
