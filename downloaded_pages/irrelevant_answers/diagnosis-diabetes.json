This test will give some indication of how much of your own insulin function remains.2.) Have you had a GAD65 (Glutamic Acid Decarboxylase Antibody) test? (not to be confused with GAD for depression). This test is useful in distinguishing between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. It should be noted that high anti-GAD antibody levels are considered markers for type 1 diabetes. When they occur in people who have what appears to be type 2 diabetes, it may indicate LADA.See this brief on LADAhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetesAlso these discussions on LADAhttp://tinyurl.com/diabetes-lada3.) An A1c test will show well you control/manage your glucose [blood sugar].Are you seeing an Endocrinologist, a diabetes specialist?",

    "question": "I have been pre-diabetic for several years now. I have a meter to moniter my levels when I dont feel right. Recently I have had several days in a row with readings between 170-220 , even after sleeping for 8 hours. Then levels go back to normal range without any apparent change in diet or exercise. Whenever the doc orders fasting tests\u00a0\u00a0i am in the normal range. I have done the glucose tolerance test twice, the first test\u00a0\u00a0made me crash too low after 2-3 hours \"63\". The second time was normal . Original diagnosis of pre diabetes was made because I had several episodes of getting too low after running . The recent high glcose readings i had were the first I have ever had that were too high. Am i still pre diabetic?",
