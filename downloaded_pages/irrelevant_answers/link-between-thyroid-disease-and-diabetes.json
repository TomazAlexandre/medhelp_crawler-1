            "answer": "I don't have diabetes (yet), though I do have Hashimoto's and diabetes runs rampant in my family - some with Type I, others with Type II.All the tests can get pretty tiring and confusing, but are necessary.Type I diabetes and Hashimoto's are both autoimmune diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Type II, or \"adult onset\" diabetes is not autoimmune, but often accompanies Hashimoto's because of the weight gain associated with hypothyroidism, caused by the Hash's, lifestyle, possible lack of exercise and other issues involved. .There are 2 types of Raynaud - one is Raynaud phenonomen, the other is Raynaud disease.\u00a0\u00a0Raynaud phenomenon is most often associated with other autoimmune diseases; do you know if this is what you have?Even with a TSH of 1.7, I have to ask if your actual thyroid hormone levels are adequate.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is a pituitary hormone and can vary for a variety of reasons, so, used alone, is not a reliable diagnostic.If you have copies of lab reports, please post your latest thyroid labs, along with the reference ranges that vary from lab to lab, so must come from your own report......If you haven't already, you might want to follow this link:http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/331197-overview",

            "answer": "Originally it was diagnosed as Reynauds disease. I was also diagnosed as bi-polar type 2 at that time. Since the Reynauds was the only physical symptom I had at that time 3 years ago and my blood work was normal still then (now it's \"inconsistent\") they did not associated it with anything else. Of course now they are re-evaluating that diagnosis.I just had my tsh, t3,t4, free t4, metobolic panel, lipid panel all ran again this week. We are monitoring them every 60 days. I'm curious to know my current levels as well. They have never ran my free t4 before this. My hoshi's was diagnosed using physical symptoms, antibody test, and ultrasound images.Thanks so much for the input",

    "question": "Hello everyone this is my first question here on MedHelp. I have been reading a lot lately about a link between thyroid disorders and an increased risk of diabetes. I didn't think much of it until my doctor had me come in this week to run some labs to screen out diabetes. I have just recently been diagnosed with hoshimoto's disease although my tsh is perfect (1.7). I also have Reynauds syndrome. In the last year I started having issues with my feet where they get painfully cold even with 2 pairs of socks and uggs on. I assumed that my Reynauds was maybe spreading to me feet although my feet have never had any discoloration like my hands get during a Reynauds flare up. My doctor claims this is often an early sign of diabetes and that there is increasing evidence that people with thyroid issues are at increased risk of developing diabetes. I love my doctor very much and she has been great at helping me identify and work through my health issues but I wanted to come here and see if anyone had any personal experience with this. Is there anyone here who has both a thyroid disease and diabetes? Were they diagnosed with both around the same time? Thanks so much for your responses. The last 3 years with all of this testing and trouble shooting has been a little overwhelming for me.",
