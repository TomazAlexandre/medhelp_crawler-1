            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Clamping the tubes cannot cause you to feel unwell, especially after or for 13 years. First consult a gynecologist and try and find the cause. It is possible you have infection or cysts or endometriosis that is the cause of your problem. You could have diabetes or hypothyroidism.Please try and consult a gynecologist to first assess gynecological problems, and a PCP to rule out anemia/thyroid/diabetes etc\u2014as all these can cause long standing problems.Take care!",
