            "answer": "It is possible, and is a side effect of all fertility treatment. Although many women express exactly the same wish that you are expressing, it is important for you to bear in mind the following:1) Human beings are meant to carry one baby at a time2) The risk of twins delivering prematurely is about 20% (compared to 8% for single baby pregnancies) and premature babies account for 75% of all babies who die shortly after birth3) Twins are more likely to have learning disabilities and cerebral palsy4) Because of the stress of raising twins, divorce rates are higher when couples have had twins.5) In some countries in Europe (Sweden, Belgium, Finland) by law only one fertilized egg at a time can be put back in IVF treatments, because of the higher risks that twin pregnancies pose.6) Mothers carrying twins are more likely to have complications during pregnancy such as high blood pressure, diabetes, separation of the afterbirth from the uterus, cesarean sections, prolonged stays in hospital for premature labor.If you have any friends who are doctors, neonatal intensive care nurses, or special ed teachers, they may well have a different opinion about twins than you do.Twins are sometimes unavoidable, and fortunately with modern medicine most twins are completely normal, but twin pregnancies are far more risky than single pregnancies.I urger you to re-think your wishes.You should definitely discuss with your doctor.",

            "answer": "Most fertility specialists are aiming for a single pregnancy, in fact they are actually better rated fertility specialists when they have lower multiple birth rates.\u00a0\u00a0Most physicians do not want multiple births because of the higher risks for both mom and baby.\u00a0\u00a0As I have struggled with infertility for years also - I would be extatic to have twins but I know that every time I have mentioned anything about that to my physicians they do not feel the same way and discuss the dangers and increased risks.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure that it won't be the first time that your doctor has heard a patient say that they are wishing for twins but I don't think that he/she will help you with increasing the odds for a multiple pregnancy either.\u00a0\u00a0But it couldn't hurt to wish - right?!?!?!",
