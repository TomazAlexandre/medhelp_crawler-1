            "answer": "Well done on being so self-aware that you realise it is an irrational fear. Some practical things you can do are to keep busy, maybe pick up some hobbies or volunteer work that keeps your focus on other people. Try to do some exercise every day. Listen to upbeat music, never sleep during the day, accept all invitations to be sociable (within reason, don't date a creep). If you find you're unable to maintain relationships with friends or you can't make it to school each day then make sure you see a doctor.Good luck.",

            "answer": "i guess i would say that i am more like your twin.. i obsess about my heart all the time, i know its an irattional fear, but at the same time i can't stop it.. usually what i do when i have these thoughts, and by the way they last for months at a time sometimes.. i will try to focus on a different problem i may have, now i know thats not the healthy thing to do, but like say i am obsessing over my heart, i will try to obsess of brain cancer instead..i know that sounds silly and not right, but it gets me thinking about something else..you seem very smart so im sure you know that diabetes comes from a not working right pancreas.. try to think of all the signs that lead to you not having it.. im sure you have less signs of it than you think..there is really no cure for what we have, sure they have meds to take, but that only fogs our heads.. we need to get through this on our own.. im sorry you have to go through this and i wish for you the best.. sorry if my insane advice doesn't work for you.. but thats just the best way i know how to make it though one day at a time.. best of luck..",

            "answer": "OMG I do the exact same thing!! Except that it doesn't work for me really. Well, kinda. I started thinking about leukemia, but then I got worried about that, but still I was more anxious about diabetes. My twin, on the other hand, uses that method as well, and it actually does work for her. Thanks for posting, its great to know that I'm not the only one (besides my twin) that is worried about my health all of the time. Thanks! Also, best of luck to you too.",

    "question": "Thirteen year old girl, and I am a hypochondriac for real. I have had this worry about diabetes for about 8 months now, and even though I have gone to the doctor and my tests came out negative, I am still convinced there is something wrong with me! Nobody in my family has had it and I'm not overweight, but I am creeped out because I am terrified of eating too much sugar. I have this fear of sugar because I think that if I have a slice of cake or something, it will make me get diabetes. I have an identical twin who is very anxious about heart attacks and stroke too, so it maybe runs in the family...",
