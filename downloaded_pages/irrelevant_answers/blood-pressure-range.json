            "answer": "I would say that broadly this is an acceptable blood pressure for someone your age. Generally blood pressure targets in patients with hypertension advocate for <140/90 with slightly lower goals for patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease. With many of my older patients, I am very interested in how they tolerate a given blood pressure. For example, many older patients find themselves on several blood pressure medications and although the number looks good, they don't tolerate that level of blood pressure due to symptoms such as fatigue, dizziness, lightheadedness, etc. To put it in other terms, that blood pressure you mentioned is great if you are feeling well. However, if you are having frequent dizzy spells, fainting, feeling fatigued, or having frequent falls you should discuss with your physician whether or not this may be related to your blood pressure. In cases like that when it is thought that the level of blood pressure control is leading to adverse effects, then it is appropriate to loosen the goals slightly to a more tolerable range. I would also add to make sure you eat well and get plenty of exercise as this can be of great help for your blood pressure and overall cardiovascular health. Furthermore, make sure to be compliant with your medications and follow up regularly with your physicians as this will help keep things on target. Best of luck.",
