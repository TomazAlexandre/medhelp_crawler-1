            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try\u00a0\u00a0provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Your whole body vibration and other symptoms could be related to diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, Vitamin B complex deficiency, neurological disorder or if you are any vibration jobs (like drilling etc). Nerve studies and nerve test may be helpful to further evaluate the condition. I would recommend evaluating the possibilities here with the help of a doctor. Further referral to a neurologist or endocrinologist may be required to assess the condition. Hope this information proves helpful to you. Take Care & Regards!!!",

    "question": "For the last several years I have had chronic pain....in the last couple it has changed and to an extent the pain has lessened but now I have bouts with a very annoying itchy rash, have jerky muscles and tingling, and have been having vibrations like a cell phone vibrating.\u00a0\u00a0All of these symptoms occur at random and on various parts of my body.\u00a0\u00a0I also have days when I can just barely do routine tasks.\u00a0\u00a0Do all of these symptoms point to any one thing or are they too general and diverse?\u00a0\u00a0They can be really annoying and are causing issues in other ares of life...thanks",
