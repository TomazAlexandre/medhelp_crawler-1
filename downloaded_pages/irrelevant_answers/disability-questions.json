            "answer": "Without knowing the specifics of your medical history and as I am not a medical professional, my suggestion to you is to enlist the help of your endocrinologist in evaluating your health status.\u00a0\u00a0He or she can direct you to the appropriate agencies that may be able to assist you.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's safe to assume that all of the stress in your life right now cannot be making controlling your diabetes any easier.\u00a0\u00a0It is important that you consult your healthcare team to help you get things turned around and on the right track.\u00a0\u00a0As someone who has lived with diabetes for over 13 years in my family, I can assure you that there are times that we all have our discouraging moments, but you need to try and keep a positive attitude, not just for your own sake, but for your children's sake also.\u00a0\u00a0Make the call & good luck to you.",

            "answer": "Dear Moonbeat,I'm not sure if being fired for diabetes automatically qualifies you as disabled.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend checking the American Disability Act on that.I can tell you of my own experience and maybe the first steps you need to take.In 1980 I was diagnosed with rhuematoid arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0After three years, I too was missing more and more days at work.\u00a0\u00a0My physician finally insisted that I go on disability.\u00a0\u00a0In my case my boss and I mutually decided that would be best.Ask your physician if he/she would recommend that due to complications of diabetes you be granted Social Security Disability and that you can no longer work.\u00a0\u00a0It is very helpful to find a pro bono attorney or one who will take a percentage of your first check.\u00a0\u00a0It will be retroactive back to the day you apply.\u00a0\u00a0I had to go before a board of Drs., a judge, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It is normal to be turned down at least two or three times before you are awarded SSD.\u00a0\u00a0This is where it's best to have a attorney to walk you through.If you get it, you can supplement your SSD, but there is a cap on how much you can make before it affects your check.Best of luck and if there is anything more we can do, please don't hesitate to contact us.jdrf team dm",

            "answer": "Submit EVERYRTHING in dated order. EVERYTHING, even notes of phone calls to Doctors. DOCUMENTATION IS EVERTHING! Note your days off and why, what was discussed, even research on the computer regarding your condition. BOMBARD them with detailed events in dated order so it reads like a progressive book. THAT shows a serious candidate, not a flake looking for a free ride. They don't have time to shuffle and find paperwork. Easier to say no and let it come back later to somebody elses desk. Remember, they are human there at SS, and apreciate well documented facts.I got my first check 5 months after I applied without one question.Good luck, hope this helps.",

    "question": "I remember seeing somewhere a list of three things that automatically qualify you as disabled if you meet one of the three. I think I remember one of them being that if you are fired from your job because of diabetes, you are automatically (by law) considered disabled. Can anyone confirm this for me? I know it might sound crazy to actually want to be considered disabled, but this is what I want. I have missed so much work from diabetes related stuff that I foresee in the very near future my job going up in smoke. I'm almost relieved by this. As it is now, I cannot afford my $245.00 a month in medical expenses. I have insurance where I work but it is shoddy at best. And because I have prescription coverage (no matter how lousy it is) I don't qualify for any type of programs to help with cost. I can't get help with medical either. I can't get help with anything UNLESS I'm disabled. THEN I qualify for monthly benefits, food stamps, medicaid, prescription programs, etc etc etc. I'm also a single mom, so this option is totally for me. I would consider working part time in order to supplement but at least I would better be able to manage my diabetes and be there for my children too. I would appreciate any opinions or suggestions on this matter.",
