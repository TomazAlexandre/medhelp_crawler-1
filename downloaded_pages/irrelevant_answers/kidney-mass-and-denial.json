            "answer": "Hi,the highs and lows are going to be devastating for his mental and physical health.There are ways of managing diabetes that can dramatically lessen these swings.\u00a0\u00a0He would need to be motivated though.\u00a0\u00a0If you are close to him, maybe you can also learn about it.Most particularly this involves following a low carb diet (carbs mostly coming from non-starchy veges), moderate protein (likely < 100 g/day) and high naturally occuring fats.\u00a0\u00a0If he does lower his carb intake then he would also need to test carefully and reduce his insulin.To control blood sugars, I assume he is taking 2 types of insulin. Fast and short acting.\u00a0\u00a0He should do some testing to make sure that his insulin doses are correct.Some reference books are:-Diabetes Solutions by Dr. Richard Bernstein (this one recommends very low carb but gives excellent info and tools for management),Think Like a Pancreas by Gary ScheinerUsing Insulin by John WalshI guess the best thing you can do is to learn as much as you can about diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Support him as best you can, and love him! (as you obviously do).",

I know things are not good, I just desperately need to know what is ahead of us.\u00a0\u00a0I am the ONLY person he has to count on and be there for him, and I don't know the truth to his health.. he keeps all information secret from me.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
