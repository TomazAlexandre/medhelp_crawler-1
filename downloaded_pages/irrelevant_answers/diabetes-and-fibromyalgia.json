            "answer": "I too have type 2 diabetes, and fibro, and also throw in degenerative osteoarthritis.\u00a0\u00a0At one time I was seeing a phusical therapist, for the fibro. I had lots of fatty lumps as you describe them. The PT\u00a0\u00a0said they were from myofascial spasm syndrome. He would exert hard pressure to break them up. Stripping up and down my arms, legs, ribcage, exc. Left lots of bruises. Over the years they have come back. My feet hurt too, You DO need to work on your diabetes at least with diet, as it can cause so many dire consequences, kidney failure, loss of limbs, even death. I don't exercise much either, it's all I can do to work 8 hours. Fibro is so awful, but if you can control your blood sugar you may find a lessening of the painful symptoms of fibro. Good luck and God bless, you are not alone.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response. I am very interested in knowing if others have these lumps as they never talk about lumps when giving the symptoms of fibromyalgia. They say that you have \"pressure points\". I want to know if this is the same as having actual lumps that can be clearly felt with slight pressure and hurt like crazy! It sounds like you have the same thing. If enough pressure is excerted on some lumps they feel like they are going down but come right back nearby. I wonder if we both have Dercum's or if these lumps are symptoms of fibromyalgia? I hope that I get more responses. At least I know that one more person has them now! I am taking four shots of insulin a day now along with the metformin and my sugar is going down but my feet still swell a lot and hurt\u00a0\u00a0so I went off the Lyrica to see if the swelling will go down and that is the only drug that I was on for the fibrymyalgia. I send good wishes and I am very glad that you responded.",

            "answer": "No, the trigger points are different from the lumps. I have the lumps in arms and legs. Trigger points are a distenct pattern than when pressed are painful. There are 18 recognized points. Most fibro websites will show you the pattern. At my last neuro exam, I exhibited pain at 16 out of the 18. Big time flare. Good luck.",

            "answer": "My rheumatologist said today that I have fibromyalgia but also Dercum's. The painful lumps in my fat are Dercum's. He put me on Neurontin and I will gradually increase the amount which may help the pain but won't cure the diseases. He also gave me shots near my tailbone in two trigger points, just a temporary help. My trigger points now cover my body in addition to the ones they always show on the charts, but I have had it for forty years. I can't take Lyrica for my diabetic neuropathy as it makes my ankles swell too much.",

My foot pain is diabetic neuropathy as I was just tested. You may also have neuropathy and we are in danger of losing our toes or feet. You need to inspect and protect your feet. I have no reflexes now in my legs or feet. It came on fast within the last few years. Now my feet feel like they are asleep and I have shooting pains in them. I can't walk at all or my ankles really swell up. I have both fibromyalgia and Dercum's. My grandparents came from Sweden and most of the research on Dercum's is being done in Sweden.

            "answer": "Hi, Sylvia, I'm Judy. I want to encourage you, because I've been in similar circumstances to what you are describing. I know how it feels to be hurting physically, and to have so many things going on with your body that you can't keep up with them. It's frustrating and depressing, and just plain sad!I'll speak a little bit to the fibromyalgia issue. I've had it for 30 years. I don't have the kind of lumps you are describing, and it sounds like some of the other posts are helping you with information about that. I do get lumps at some of the trigger points, like in my upper back between my shoulder blades, and the only thing that helps that is massage and alternating ice and heat. I tried Lyrica last year, and it did manage the pain fairly well, but it made me feel bloated and it also dulled other physical sensations like the urge to have a bowel movement and sexual sensation. It works wonderfully for some people, but I wasn't one of them. I returned to a higher dosage of my old standby....amitriptyline. It's an old fashioned treatment, but it works for me, with few side effects. Part of why it works is because it helps me sleep like a log, which really can make everything better. Sleep is so important for so many of the physical issues you and I have, and for mental, emotional, and spiritual well being.I've been borderline diabetic for many years and was recently diagnosed with Type II Diabetes. I am on Metformin. I was worried I couldn't take it because I have had issues with IBC and poor GI function for years, but I did fine. I had GI upset for a time, but we used the Met ER and began with one, then added another. I don't have any problems unless I eat poorly, and then my GI system lets me know I need to shape up. My blood sugars run 110-125 in the morning, which is still a bit higher than I want, but my doc is very happy. I usually drop down in the afternoon, sometimes too far, if I don't remember to snack in the afternoon. Last week, I had an 81 and a 66. I've been on Met for almost four months now and my sugars have gradually come down, my appetite has gradually lessened, and I finally am seeing a bit of weight loss...nothing spectacular, but spectacular isn't what works in the longrun...it's that slow and steady progress that is so good for us.The most encouaging thing I think I can share with you is how much better I've done by viewing myself as an intricate WHOLE. I view all of my physical maladies and diseases as related, and I pursue solutions that help with multiple issues. Not only do I view the physical things as related to each other, but I view them as related to my mental/emotional state, and to my spiritual condition. Even taking control of small things helps on so many levels. Let me give you some examples...First and foremost, do what your doctor says! Then, communicate the results to him/her, and get ongoing advice for adjusting dosages, changing meds, etc. There are many solutions to each problem, and some work better than others for each individual. Make a commitment to work closely with your doctor and don't put off going in or give up or neglect to communicate promptly and clearly. There is something very empowering about taking the initiative to get treatment and to ask to adjust treatment in view of your results.One example of how one small lifestyle change has made a huge difference in my life is that I noticed that my skin was very dry, my heels calloused and cracked. This is common with hypothyroidism, and with diabetes, both of which I have. I also know that diabetics need to be particularly careful with their feet. So, I made a commitment to solve this problem, no matter what it took. I sanded my heels, moisturized my entire body every day, and discovered that drinking lots and lots and LOTS of unadulterated water not only made my skin and heels better, but it did a lot of other good things for me. It reduced my appetite, made my food digest better, made my hair and nails healthier, and so on.An example of the physical/emotional/mental/spiritual connection issue is that I knew all of my physical issues were made worse by stress. So I set about reducing the stress in my life by learning to say no. Consequently, I feel better, I find I have more time to devote to taking care of myself, I can spend more time in prayer and meditation, I can think more clearly, and I have more peace.Make 2010 your year for getting healthier. Take on one or two things at a time, and follow through until you have a satisfactory result. Be excited about small victories! I had a hard time learning to set my goals low enough. I wanted to be at my ideal weight in a year. That would have meant losing 80 pounds! How unrealistic is that for someone with all my problems? My doc told me, \"Judy, if you lose just five pounds this year and keep them off, I'll be ecstatic.\" So I have stopped looking at the ultimate goal, and begun to look at the short term goal that involves a lifestyle change. If you do that, the results will come, slow and steady. You said you can't exercise, and it hurts to move at all. So forget exercising, and instead, put a sticky note in each doorway of your house that reminds you to stretch a part of your body when you walk through it. You'd be surprised how much difference that one thing will make. And don't forget to pat yourself on the back each day you meet that goal (that in itself is a good stretch!).I want to keep watching on this post and keep encouraging you, Sylvia, because encouraging you encourages myself, too. Good luck!Judy",

My feet and ankles sometimes hurt so bad I can't sleep or walk. I am on Lyrica for fibromyalgia and it makes the swelling worse.My blood sugar is coming down slowly with the insulin.I was put on another blood pressure pill but it made the swelling worse. I take Lisinopril and a water pill and am trying another new pill. My blood is still high. I wonder if I should go off the Lyrica? I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 40 years ago. I have lumps in all the adipose tissue on my body. They are extremely painful and I have bands of them everywhere. My hips and lower back hurt so bad I can't walk more than a few steps. Some of the lumps are so big that you can see them like on the back of my neck. If you press on me anywhere you can feel them.I think that I have Dercum's but my rheumatologist said he has never seen a case of Dercum's. I have Sjogren's and IBS and migrains. I have to drink water all the time and still feel dehydrated. I have gained 100 pounds in the last five years. It hurts so much to do anything that I don't exercise. I had to quit working and am 62 and on Social Security.I have sciatica so bad I can hardly sit upright and lots of lumps in my lower back and buttocks. Do other people with fibromyalgia have lumps? This is the one question I would love to have answered. I of course have all the pressure points associated with fibromyalgia but also I have lumps from little to as big as walnuts in all of my fat especially around my joints and rib cage.I don't feel up to working on my diabetes as I am in so much pain from the fibromyalgia or Dercum's.",
