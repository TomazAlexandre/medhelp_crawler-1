            "answer": "Hi,It could be from your hair coloring, but the major issue is to make sure it is not related to diabetes, or possibly your medication, or another health issue. Has a dermatologist looked at the rash? If not, I think that is your best option, given that I cannot see what it looks like. Diabetes can be associated with rashes that stem from fungal infections. Plus the medications can have some side effects, so speak with your doctor soon, have him/her take a look at it and if necessary see a dermatologist. Seek medical help immediately if any of the rash starts to blister or flake off in large clumps, as this could be a sign of something more serious.",
