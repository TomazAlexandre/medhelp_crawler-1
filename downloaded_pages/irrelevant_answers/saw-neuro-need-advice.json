            "answer": "Thank you for your response. I have not had a LP or a spinal MRI , OR A MRI w/ Contrast. Nor any blood work to rule anything else out.\u00a0\u00a0He pretty much took one look at me, saw that I was overweight, and had a hx of hypertension and diabetes and said it was vascular. Even thought the lesions were periventricular and he did not actually look at the films. His neuro exam consisted of him looking in my eyes, squeezing my hands, and having me stand up straight with my feet together, eyes closed (which I promptly toppled over). That was it. Told me didn't have MS , gave script for migraine med , told me to take a asprin a day and he would repeat a MRI in 6 mo to see\"if anything else shows up\". Said I had neuropathy. Then he sent me on my way.",

            "answer": "Did I read correctly that you have another neurology appointment in 2 months?\u00a0\u00a0Is that with a new neuro or another one?In my opinion, a neurologist isn't worth much who does not view the MRI's for themselves.\u00a0\u00a0Can you imagine an orthopedist not looking for themselves at an Xray?I don't know much about vasculitis but a little research states there are several types with these general signs and symptoms:FeverFatigueWeight lossMuscle and joint painLoss of appetiteNerve problems, such as numbness or weaknessDifferent types of vasculitis require different treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Since vasculitis has been thrown at you, it would be a good idea to go to a rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0It would be a good idea even if no mention of vasculitis was made.What strikes me is that you are young enough to have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, yet have mild brain atrophy which is more common in older folks.\u00a0\u00a0This may mean absolutely nothing but I would want a confirmation and explanation of this.\u00a0\u00a0Are you over 50?I have never heard of pre-diabetics developing neuropathy, but I'm not a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Like you, I question much of what was told to you and am thinking out loud.\u00a0\u00a0If vasculitis is on the table an ANA and ANCA test is in order.\u00a0\u00a0I only know this from my own experience during testing for what ailed me pre-diagnosis.Have you read our Health Pages?\u00a0\u00a0Located upper right corner on this page.http://www.medhelp.org/health_pages/list?cid=36Specifically what tests you could expect:http://www.medhelp.org/health_pages/Multiple-Sclerosis/Common-Blood-Test-Youll-See-During-the-Diagnosis-Process/show/446?cid=36Your PCP can order a good bunch of these tests if willing.Good luck to you.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Okay.\u00a0\u00a0I looked at your history of posts and that you are less than 50 years-old.This doctor neurologists response on the Neurology Board is accurate except for\u00a0\u00a0\"The treatment is essentially limited to symptomatic therapy so the course of action would not change much whether MS has been diagnosed or not.\"\u00a0\u00a0Not so!!\u00a0\u00a0The Disease Modifying Drugs CAN change the course of disease.http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Neurology/Crawling-sensation--top-of-head/show/1496831?personal_page_id=2101389#post_6800454Another question, please.\u00a0\u00a0Are headaches new for you?",

            "answer": "I'd say that with your history of symptoms and an MRI which shows lesion activity, it's time to eliminate MS as a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think the neurologist you saw has done so.\u00a0\u00a0I would talk to the MRI clinic and get copies of your films (CD or actual films) and seek a second opinion.Unfortunately the training of neurologists is so inconsistent that many people like you have problems with being in limbo, all because the neuros don't know how to diagnose MS.\u00a0\u00a0They're used to dealing with large problems.Your MRI mentioned mild atrophy.\u00a0\u00a0It's quite possible that you have a kind of MS which causes minimal lesion activity.\u00a0\u00a0Evidently I've had MS for a long time, but I don't have a lot of lesions.\u00a0\u00a0I just recently had OCT testing, which measures the thickness of your retinal nerve fiber layer.\u00a0\u00a0The layer is quite thin in places, which tells the neurologist I've had MS for ten years or more.\u00a0\u00a0Optical coherence tomography isn't used in all areas, but I would definitely recommend it for cases like yours, where there aren't a lot of lesions, but there's neurological symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I'll see if I can dig up my post for you.",

            "answer": "I have posted in the MS and Neurology forum trying to get any information, I am so desperate and upset as I am sure many people are. I know something is wrong. I am not making this up and I dont understand how Drs. just seem to not care. Basically I feel my PCP did more of a evaluation than he did. To answer your question, I have had headaches in the past, sinus headaches when I had sinus infections, and even had migraines when I was going through my divorce but nothing like I have been experiencing recently. And never had vision and eye pain with them like this time.When I asked the neurologist about the mild atrophy, he said it means nothing. So in his words,I definately do not have MS, I am overweigth with a history of high bp and diabetes. So he is treating me for migraines and he said I might have some neuropathy and can be tested for carpel tunnel. My husband and I just looked at each other liked what the ????\u00a0\u00a0My husband was shocked.",

    "question": "Well, saw my first Neuro after my first MRI today.. After a 5 minute exam , he told me I did not have MS. Said I had small vessel disease b/c of my weight and hx of high bp and IF I was having any numbness it was neuropathy from my diabetes. I was in shock. First off, I have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome which caused hyperinsulinemia and have borderline diabetetes. I take a metformin everyday b/c of that and do not have to test blood sugars daily and have never had a high A1c. This still does not explain my heat intolerance, joint pain, why I am falling, weakness, fatigue, blance issues and vision problems,as well as memory issues and speech. I left his office in shock. I later called back and asked his nurse how he could determine with no further testing and she said ne MRI. I then asked, so he had my MRI films and she said no, but he had the report. Still dont understand how its so conclusive. Only thing he gaveme any meds for was migraines. OK.This is what the report said:I have been having severe headaches over the last 2 months or so along with blurred vision and eye pain. This is what caused the PCP to order a MRI.\u00a0\u00a0Have had spells of falling over the last 2 yrs. And lately,\u00a0\u00a0numbness and tingling in my extremities, major fatigue, a crawling sensation on my skin, \"pins and needles\" sensations on my scalp and forearm, pinkie and ring finger on right hand going numb, eye twitching for days, and numbness in my cheek and nose. I am also having trouble remembering things.The PCP is sending me to a Neurologist but it is not for 2 months. Part of me wonders if I even need to go.This is what the MRI showed: the MRI was done w/o contrast. Everything was pretty much unremarkable , no evidence of edema (CVA). On the flair sequence there are a few small focal areas of increased signal in the periventricular and supraventricular white matter.Opinion: 1.Mild Periventricular Leoukoaraiosis. Differential diagnosis for this age group includes previous sheer axonal injury, vasculitis, MS , among others,2. Mild Atrophy.Please help me here.....Is he right? Do I take his word for it? What do I do next?",
