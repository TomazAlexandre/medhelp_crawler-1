            "answer": "I agree completely with sehale. You CAN eat some junk food and it won't harm the baby or cause birth defects, but eating healthy is best for EVERYONE! the more controlled her weight gain, the healthier her diet, the healthier her entire pregnancy will be. Unless her doctor has indicated otherwise, it's also important for her to be getting light to moderate exercise several days a week - this will help when it comes time for the \"big day\" because her body will be conditioned and healthy. But make sure to have her ask her doctor first!Make SURE she stays away from diet drinks, keeps her water intake high, and just makes balanced choices for her foods - she can have sugary or fatty foods in moderation so don't go \"Food Nazi\" on her and refuse to let her eat ANYTHING unhealthy...just make sure she focuses on maximizing the healthy food and keeping the \"junk\" to a minimum. :-)",

            "answer": "You mentioned birth defects -some defects are genetically related and cannot be helped by a healthy diet, but other defects can. for example, 400mg of folic acid daily can help prevent neural tube defects. It's best that she take a daily prenatal vitamin to supplement her diet, because we don't necessarily get the vits and minerals in our meals everyday.",
