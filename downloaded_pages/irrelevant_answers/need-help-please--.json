            "answer": "Hi ,Your fasting reading is 97, even\u00a0\u00a0less than 100, to me, indicates that you are a pre-diabetic,To find out if you are diabetic or not, to me, the most inexpensive and quickest way is purchasing a A1C self-test kit called A1C NOW made by Bayer available at WalMart or Walgreeen for about $29.90. This kit is very accurate and simply follow the instruction voila in 5 minutes, the result is in front of you. Good luck",

            "answer": "There might be something else going on. I would talk to your doctor about getting your A1C's done PROPERLY (not a store test), to determine this. That will be the true indicator.Or you can do what my little brother did. Drank a bunch of sugared koolaid and waited to go to the ER because his blood sugar was too high. lolSeriously, though, it could be something else.",
