    "question": "I've not been dieting, but all of a sudden I lost my appetite. I didn't even realize it, until one morning getting my daughters ready for the bus & almost passing out, it hit me that I hadn't eaten anything in almost a week, with the exception of drinking fluids. I've always been comfortable with my weight. I am tall and don't show my weight. I'm 5'11\", and 169lbs never showed much. I stood on my scales after getting the girls on the bus and it showed 145lbs. I was in total shock! I've been trying to put the weight back on, but I still have no desire for food.Any suggestions for getting my appetite back?& any advice on what could be causing my loss of appetite?I'm a seemingly healthy 26 year old mother of 4.Please help.All advice is welcome & appreciated.Thanks in advance.",
