            "answer": "\"my reading was 15.3 yesterday so have increased tablets to 5 a day.\"It is unwise to adjust your medication without first talking with a doctor. This can be very dangerous. What is 15.3? When did you take this reading? Fasting? 2-4 hours after eating? And how? Where? Was the glucose meter calibrated?Dark urine can be symptoms of kidney or liver disease. I have never heard of Ciro in Harare or of Brufane Tablets. I searched for Brufane Tablets and came up empty. Is this some made-up home remedy concoction in your country? You must make all efforts to physically see a doctor. A complete checkup exam is in order before health issues worsen. This must include full blood draws for laboratory examination.",

            "answer": "Hello, Sengwa.I am not a doctor and can't diagnose your condition.\u00a0\u00a0And, I don't know everything that you're suffering from right now.\u00a0\u00a0However, the usual cause of tingling and numbness in the arm is a pinched nerve somewhere.\u00a0\u00a0If the whoe arm is numb and tingling then the nerve could be pinched in the shoulder or in the neck.\u00a0\u00a0I see you're from Zimbabwe and medical care is hard to get.\u00a0\u00a0But, if you can arrange for it, a neurologist can coduct an electromyography test.\u00a0\u00a0This is where a needle is placed above and below joints to test how fast an electrical signal travels.\u00a0\u00a0If the speed is slow, there is compression in the joint.Also, an MRI can reveal where the nerve is compressed.\u00a0\u00a0For right now, I would take a medication that reduces inflamation (ibuprofen) and see if you start to feel better after a few days.\u00a0\u00a0Also rest and ice at the shoulder and neck may relieve the pressure.Best of luck!Curt",

            "answer": "I forgot; stop the Brufane until you see a doctor. It may be interfering with the Metformin or causing other health issues. I would like to add by eating well-balanced meals in the correct amounts, along with moderate exercise (like walking) and weight control, you can keep your blood glucose level as close to normal (non-diabetes level) as possible.",

    "question": "I have over the past few days been feeling `numbness and tingaling' in my lower right arm (the whole arm). I am on Metiformane Tablets 3 x day but found my reading was 15.3 yesterday so have increased tablets to 5 a day. Any suggestions on what else I can do for this. I do not have easy acess to Doctor or medicines at present.The urine I am passing is very dark yellow in colour it does not smell. I also do not feel 100% at any stage of the day or night and am taking Brufane Tablets for my back pain (as below).I also have a continious back pain which has been with me for the past 5 months. Seen a Ciro in Harare who basically said back is messed ( hit too many Landmines 20 years ago in a war :) )and have been taking Brufane Tablets about 6 a day which help with pain but not always so good. Also not sure if one should be taking this type of tablet for long time? Is there any other tablet that I can take that will effectively relieve the pain but not be harmful in the long run. The pain is not very sore but enough to get ones attention and effect sleep at night.Any suggestion would be nuch apperciated.",
