            "answer": "Auto immune thyroid disease whether Grave's or Hashimoto can only be detected by either a TPO-ab or a TSI test.Most doctors checking for thyroid disease will not take the extra step running these antibody tests.If you are concerned that you may have autoimmune thyroid disease - these tests must be done.",

            "answer": "thanks for your reply, my reasoning behind this is that i suspect i have MS and i am also finding it an uphill struggle to loose weight. Previously, if i needed to shift a bit of weight it would be quite simple but now it is almost impossible, despite a good diet and exercise.So the basic tests i have undergone are unlikely to have shown up this type of disease unless they were actually looking in that area.thanks again",

            "answer": "A lot of Hashimoto symptoms look alot like MS symptoms. You really do need to get an anti-bodies test done for thyroid anti-bodies.\u00a0\u00a0Hashimoto's can come and go like MS which can make it quite confusing for you.Doctors tend to not test for something they don't believe you have. You can and should insist on lots of tests to prove or disprove any disease. Do you have any lab results we can have a look at yet? It could be hypothyroidism too.",

            "answer": "As my buddy Red suggests MS symptoms can be conflicted with other autoimmune diseases.We don't doubt you have done some checking - but further testing into antibodies should be done before any quick DxIf you can post your labs that would be good.Your symptoms are so general with many things that I have a feeling for your sake - \"being ran through the mill\" of tests would be wise.",

    "question": "Hi hope you guys can help me, i have lots of MS type symptoms and i am currently waiting for a neurologist appointment and after that an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I am aware there are links between MS and thyroid disorders but what is the difference between your average underachieve thyroid and an auto-immune thyroid ?I was tested for Diabetes last year and this was negative, they also tested my thyroid from a blood test and that seemed ok.\u00a0\u00a0But i am not sure if they would have performed different thyroid tests if they had suspected MS at that stage or if the one blood test can detect any differences?Cheers George",
