            "answer": "Hi MS,How are you feeling?Peripheral neuropathy (PN) refers to a peripheral nerve disorder of any cause.Nerve involvement may be single (mono-neuropathy) or multiple (poly-neuropathy); pathology may be axonal or de-myelinating.The typical axonal poly-neuropathy begins with sensory symptoms (tingling or burning) distally in the toes or feet. Symptoms spread proximally to the ankles, then involve the calves.Do you feel your sensations are lost around your knee joint and also around wrist and palm?Do you feel that light touch of anything is painful?Is tingling and numbness symmetrical?What investigations are been done so far?You should be doing HbA1C, ESR, serum protein/immuno-electrophoresis, and vitamin B12, BUN, and creatinine levels.The Electro-Diagnostic studies examination ordinarily comprises electromyography (EMG) and nerve conduction studies (NCSs).If your symptoms aren\u2019t symmetrical, than it can be mono-neuropathy.Mono-neuropathies are usually caused by trauma, compression, or entrapment. Sensory and motor symptoms are in the distribution of a single nerve\u2014most commonly Ulnar or median nerves in the arms or peroneal nerve in the leg.Since how long are your symptoms?Keep me informed.Bye.",
