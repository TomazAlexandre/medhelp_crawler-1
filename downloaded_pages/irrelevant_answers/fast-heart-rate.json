            "answer": "I would suggest that you have your doctor consider an event monitor or holter monitor that will record your son's heart rate for a longer period of time.\u00a0\u00a0He may be experiencing SVT, which can be triggered by fluxuations in blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0However, this rhythm can go unnoticed if the patient is not having palps at the time of the EKG.I'm not sure how well an event monitor would work for a 4 year old, but since your son has type 1 diabetes, he's probably pretty used to medical technology and may do well.Good luck!!!",

            "answer": "I agree that a holtor monitor would be the way to go.\u00a0\u00a0If your son is not having this fast heart beat at the time the EKG is done, the EKG will be normal. I would talk to the doctor about this and suggest getting this monitor on.\u00a0\u00a0 This way you can hopefully get this documented\u00a0\u00a0when it happens and then you can go from there. Keep us posted.",
