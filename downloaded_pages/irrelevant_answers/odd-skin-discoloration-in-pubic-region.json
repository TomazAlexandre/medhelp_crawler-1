            "answer": "Hello,This kind of discoloration can be due to hyperpigmentation, acanthosis nigricans or erythrasma. In erythrasma, the typical appearance is well-demarcated, brown-red macular patches. The skin has a wrinkled appearance with fine scales. Wood lamp examination and gram staining are the tests for its diagnosis.My sincere advice is to consult a dermatologist and get it evaluated.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I have a slight skin discoloration (skin is slightly darker) in the crack/crease where the upper thigh and pubic region intersect.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't a large patch (maybe an inch and half in diameter), and it doesn't itch whatsoever.\u00a0\u00a0It has a distinct border to it (you can tell where the patch stops and the normal skin starts), and I can't really feel any difference between the patch and the normal skin around it.\u00a0\u00a0Again, there is no discomfort in the affected area, its just sort of unsightly.\u00a0\u00a0Any idea what this could and/or possible treatments for it?",
