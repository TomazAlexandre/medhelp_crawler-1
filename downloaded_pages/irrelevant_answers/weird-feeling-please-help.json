            "answer": "\"btw my blood sugar is running fine.\"Hmmm....you didn't mention what it is fasting, preprandial or postprandial, so how can we tell?You can get that 'loopy' feeling from high glucose levels or from a variety of health issues. How long after a meal was 1:40 when hit you hard?Your post doesn't mention1. Have you purchased and use a home glucose test meter?2. Do you know when to test?3. Do you know what normal ranges are?4. What are your test results; fasting, preprandial, postprandial5.. Are you adhering to a diabetic diet?6.. Do you perform 30 mnutes of daily physical exercise?7. Are you at normal body weight?If you cannot afford to see a doctor go to the ER. Inform them of your financial hardships and they will work with you.",

I know with diabetes you have a lot to remember to do, but this is one of the more important things.Hugs :)",

If not see if a friend is a member of a gym/health club or check your local gym/health club for free trial membership programs. My area clubs have this equipment onsite. While there do some exercise to get your blood circulating. Good luck",
