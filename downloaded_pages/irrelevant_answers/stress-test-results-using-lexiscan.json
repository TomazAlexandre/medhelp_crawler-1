            "answer": "If I where in your shoes, I would ask about an angio.CABG generally have a shelf life of 10-15 years, so if yours has lasted 23 it is definitely time to take a closer look. Even if nothing is wrong, they should be doing angio's every couple of years just to stay abreast of it since it may be rapid and severe if they wait for it to show itself naturally.",

            "answer": "Sorry, I forgot to clarify the \"why\" of my opinion.The Lexi-scan and all the imaging is great for showing persistent restrictions. But they don't show things like a 90% blockage that allows sufficient blood flow until a normal everyday small blood clot blocks and stops all blood flow.The angio will show the current status of hidden high risk blockages.",

    "question": "I had a kidney transplant June 2014. Shortly after I started having shortness of breath and significant leg fatigue on any exertion.. Many xrays and tests to determine cause.All lung xrays, CT scan of lungs, breathing perfusion tests normal. Heart echo normal. BNP 800+. Chemical Stress test results show abnormality in typical vasculation distribution of distal right coronary artery (small amount of scar) and mid left descending coronary artery (small amount of scar). No ischemia. LV EF is 40%. Study shows intermediate risk of cardiac event. My question would be what is the next step and course of treatment. Prior to transplant I had two stress tests and both showed same results...no difference in vasculation and EF of 50-55%. I had quad bypass in 1991 after mild heart attack. Transplant threw me into full blown type 2 diabetes.",
