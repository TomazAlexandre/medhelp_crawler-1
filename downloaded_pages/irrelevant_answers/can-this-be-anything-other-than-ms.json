            "answer": "I've been going through the rounds of testing for months...... I, too am anxious.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also weary of the \"waiting game.\"As I'm a bit farther along in all this testing, in hindsight, I believe this advice might be helpful --- ask your doctor to do a full work up with blood tests (lyme disease, etc).\u00a0\u00a0There are things that can be discovered through blood testing, which is a much quicker discovery and often overlooked in the rush to have MRI's done.All the things DrNoopurMD mentioned above - vitamin B12 deficiency, metal poisoning, etc as well as lyme disease, thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0Get tested for those by your General Practioner, or the Neuro if he'll order up the tests.\u00a0\u00a0Don't wait for the 5 rounds of testing to look back and discover that blood testing may have ruled something out or diagnosed something much sooner.God Bless!Amy",

    "question": "I get a stinging feeling in random parts of my body. While it happens mostly on feet/hands, it can be anywhere in my body, including my face. But it's not numb, it's also not like the \"pins and needles\" feeling when your nerves recover from numbness. It's just like a tiny cold pin touches my skin for a second. It doesn't happen at the same location, it's almost totally random.My feet and hands are almost always cold.I get little twitches anywhere in my body. They're not consistent, it just happens for a milisecond.When I'm sleeping, my fingers usually go numb. Actually, my thumb got numb yesterday during MRI, as a result of not moving for half an hour. When I move my hands for couple of seconds, it goes away without any discomfort.I know it's impossible to diagnose anything here, and I know these symptoms can mean anything individually. But what I'm curious about is.. Is there any disease/deficiency other than MS that can cause all these symptoms together?I already went to a neurologist, he didn't say anything specific. Waiting for the MRI results but as you may guess, it's a stressful wait. And there's no guarantee that MRI will show what's wrong.",
