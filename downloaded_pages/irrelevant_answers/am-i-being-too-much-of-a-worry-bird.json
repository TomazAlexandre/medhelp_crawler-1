            "answer": "Girl you sound normal to me! Worrying about our unborn babies (and even our born babies) comes with the territory. Especially when you factor in already having 3mc's. I am so shocked that your OB has not been a little more proactive to helping you put your mind at ease! How far along are you??

            "answer": "I hear you.....I am 7-8 weeks pregnant with my third pregnancy (first was a miscarriage at 11 weeks, second was a pre-term birth at 22 weeks (in which the baby only survived for a few hours) in three years......I have set up an appointment with the ob/gyn, but it is not until Friday...... when i called the ob's office two and a half weeks ago to set up the appointment, I told them my history, my age (35 and 9 months), and that I have type II diabetes....... the physicians assistant didn't even want to schedule me to see the ob, she immediately said oh well we are going to skip your ob appointment and make an appointment at our other office that has a perinatal specialist......While my husband and I know it is a precaution, and in both ours and our child's best interest to see the specialist, we have had a great deal of worry....... yet we know that worrying isn't going to help any of us.....we have to trust that whatever happens, we have each other, our love, and hopefully a healthy baby......We empathize with you, and if we can be of any help, talking or whatever please let us know......wishing you the best of luck..... Please let us know how you are doing.....",
