            "answer": "We have checked to see if scott is lactose interlorant. It appears he is not. he is now at the point that everything he eats causes stomache pains, diarrhea, or a bm wihtin 45 minutes to 2 hours after he eats. He was on the pump, but went back to shots after an er visit on feb.28. his endocrin thought this would give him more control. I call his endocrin every other day. Scott is miserable and has stomache pain all the time. His insulin dosages has been almost doubled and he still has high constant blood sugars. We check his bg every two and half hours and watch him do all his shots. all his doctors(endocrin, g.i. and pediatrician)are waiting to see what the tests results will show on this Thursday. He has also been taking Metformin for about three years, because he was thought to be insulin resistant. His g.i. took him off that April 19 and his endocrin agreed. He also had an upper GI three weeks ago but results were normal. Scott has missed alot of school because of\u00a0\u00a0all of this, but we will have to worry about that later. His face has also been red for about a month, and we were told that is because of the constant high bgs. His stomach pain is constant. Our huge fear that the endoscopy and colonoscopy will come back normal also and then what????????? By the way Scott is 17 and was diagnosed when he was 12. Help if you can.",

            "answer": "Hello Scott's Mom,Your Scott & the whole family are certainly enduring a lot of pain ... and worry.I'm also not a physician, but have had DM for about 35 years, dx'd as a teen.\u00a0\u00a0Until you get the endo & colonoscopy, perhaps you can work with Scott \"as if\" he has gastroparesis or irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).\u00a0\u00a0By that I mean, read up on the foods & liquids that are particularly difficult for folks to digest and see if he can avoid those.Here are some links from reliable sources for you to read & check in with the endo about:http://www.jhbmc.jhu.edu/Motil/motilfac.htmlhttp://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/a-z.asp (listing of diseases, not a happy read) and focusing on gastroparesis:http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/gastroparesis/index.htmPerhaps his endo will Rx a liquid food, nutrient supplement since he's likely losing weight that perhaps he cannot afford to.BTW, it's not unusual for teen boys to require a LOT of insulin as their other hormones start surging.\u00a0\u00a0A mom I know with 2 DM young adults reports taht her son takes over 100 units per day while her daughter takes under 30.\u00a0\u00a0They are both of average weight/build and their endo chalked it up to yet another difference between males & females at this time of life.In general, when my BG is high, I'm more likely to have digestive issues, too.\u00a0\u00a0Be very careful to check his ketone levels since prolonged high ketones are VERY dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0Hydration is usually sufficient for low, moderate,and even periodic high ketone levels.\u00a0\u00a0Prolonged high ketones REQUIRES a call to the endo/on-call doc and often requires a trip to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0High levels of ketones muck up our digestive system (and everything else) for a while, too.\u00a0\u00a0Urine test strips for ketones are available at all pharmacies without a Rx.Good luck and do let us know what you find out.\u00a0\u00a0As scared and alone as you all may feel right now, I'm certain there are hundreds of folks reading this thread who relate to it on a very personal level.",

            "answer": "MY daughter had that problem with diarrhea, and stomach pains. The problem went away when we made sure that the food she ate did not have Manitol or sorbital. These 2 items give her diarrhea within 20 minutes, sometimes so bad that she literally ***** in her pants. Olin also does this to people.A lot of Sugar free and low carb products have these ingredients. I would suggest that you try to eliminate these items from the diet and see what happens.Our daughter was diagnosed with diabetes and then developed this problem.\u00a0\u00a0Mo one told us about this problem it was some thing I found out myself and confirmed with the doctors.\u00a0\u00a0 This is why we do not give our daughter anything that is sugar free except for soda.\u00a0\u00a0 The problem with the diarrhea and stomach pains went a way in days once we chanced her diet.Good luck I hope this helps and that it is not something more serious",

            "answer": "I have been through all this before. And I can offer some advioce. i am not a medical doctor but have had a personal experience in this field.I started having the exact same problems after being a diabetic for 5 years (type 1, at age 16)It took me on a long road that required many tests which were always negative,many days spent in hospitals, until one day i dug up some information on the net and forwarded it to my gastroenterologist, a simple test and bingo, we found the problem.Get a simple stool fat content test done, and see if the digestive enzyme levels are correct (eg if the stool contains too much fat, there is a deficency that needs to be corrected, urgently)My pancreas shut down totally. No more insulin production at first, then the bicarbonate production that controls stomach acid shut down as well, lastly it was the digestime enzymes production that gave way. I am on daily medication to control my stomach acid levels, and need to take digestive enzymes with every meal.I never had pancreatitis and my pancreas is totally normal otherwise. the reason why it stopped working is unknown, but it all started with my type-1 diabetes.Once this happens, its a mission to control your sugar levels, I used to go from hypo to hyper like 5 times a day. Now its under much better control, but still not in the way that it was when I was just a diabetic. I need to test many times a day and keep tabs on my meals etc.Hope this helps in some way",

            "answer": "hI! A lot has been happening with Scott since we last posted. His test results form the upper endoscopy and colonoscopy were all normal. We have read so much about artificial sweetners that we have really cut back on them. I have tried to convince Scott to totally stop using anything with sweetners, but he wants to know what can he drink besides water? He has an appointment to go back to see his gi doctor in July. I told this doctor Scott is STILL HAVING stomache pain, diahrrea and high blood sugars and he said he wants to leave the high blood sugars to Scott's endorcrin.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0. I said that we all think th high blood sugars are because of the stomache pain but I'm not sure he gets that. I have called back to get his appointment moved up and we are on the waiting list to do so. In the meantime, his blood sugars are alittle bit better when he has absolutely has no sugar-free stuff. But. he still has some stomache pain every time he eats, and diahrrea at least once a day.I just read the June 4 posting and will bring that up with Scott's gi doctor. Every once who has responded has been very helpful. I feel we are learning alot, but we haven't quite find out Scott's EXACT problem. Thanks for all info.",
