            "answer": "Hello,Understand your predicament. As your doctor has predicted excessive sleepiness could be the\u00a0\u00a0symptom of a sleep disorder called Narcolepsy. This sleep disorder is characterized by excessive day time sleepiness, sleep paralysis, cataplexy where the person has episodes of loss of muscle function while awake, hypnogogic hallucinations and automatic behavior.Narcolepsy is diagnosed by the sleep onset REM episodes (SOREMs), wherein the person goes into the dream phase or REM cycle soon after sleep onset. This is evident in the Multiple Sleep Latency Test (MSLT). You will need to consult your primary care physician, who may schedule you for a polysomnogram (sleep test) and a MSLT to rule out sleep disorders and initiate appropriate therapy.Hope This Helped and Do Keep Us Posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Excessive sleepiness can be due to other sleep disorders. These disorders can be like obstructive sleep apnea, wherein during sleep there is an obstruction to air flow due to laxity of the throat muscles during sleep and this could cause restlessness. Another cause could be an entity called restless leg syndrome, where there is an odd sensation in the legs during sleep causing the individual to move, which relieves the sensation. These disorders can cause inadequate sleep leading to fatigue and daytime sleepiness. Excessive daytime sleepiness is also known to occur with depression, obesity diabetes and hypothyroidism.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
