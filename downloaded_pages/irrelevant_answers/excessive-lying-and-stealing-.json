    "question": "My daughter is 8 years old and for the past year she has been lying about stealing candies. I know it's just candy but it has become a big deal. She takes them from my room or cabinet or even steals them from my sisters house and sneaks them in her room or bathroom. When I find the wrappers under her bed or closet I ask her why she took them she always responds with I don't know or because if I ask you will say no or because she thinks about not doing it but can't stop herself. I allow her to eat candy just not often because she does terrible at dental visits. I have tried talking calmly,grounding, taking away toys, holding of objects for a few munutes and even spanking. I'm at my wits end. I have no more candy but now its ice cream or any other snack.Nothing has worked and the problem seems to be getting more frequent. Any suggestions?????",
