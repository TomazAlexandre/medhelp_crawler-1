    "question": "Hi well last night i was checking my sugar levels and my 5 year old was like do me mommy so i fugred sure why not he is always taking my meter and lancet and trying to play with it and i figured well if i poke him he will see it hurts and maybe he won't touch it anymore so i checked it and it was 426 i wanted to check it again but he just would not let me do it and then today he did let me check it again and it was 296 and then i checked it an hour later and it was 158 i am not sure what normal sugar levels for a child are suppose to be at and any help would be great and also when i checked it and it was 426 it had been 30 mins since he ate and he ate half of a piece of vegetarian pizza and then when it was 296 it was an hour after he ate a small bowl of potatoe chips.\u00a0\u00a0I am just worried i don't want him to develop diabetes i had gestational diabetes when i was pregnant with him can that make him at higher risk for developing it and i now have diabetes i had it during my pregnancy with my 2 year old and my 6 month old daughter also and now i still have it i guess it didn't go away like it did the other times. My son has an appt tomorrow at 10 but any insight till then would really make me feel better i just sat there and cried when i took his reading. And then\u00a0\u00a0i laughed because he said mommy don't cry and then he asked for a cupcake lol i gave him a peach instead .",
