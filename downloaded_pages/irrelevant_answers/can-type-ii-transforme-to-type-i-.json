This is a good question to post on the Ask a Doctor forums next door;Dr Ramsetty - Diabetes - Adult Type IIDr Pho - GastroenterologyHere's what I very briefly know. The pancreas has two tissues;Endocrine - produces insulinExocrine - produces digestive juicesPancreatic disease(s) may affect the Endocrine making it not produce insulin as in type 1 diabetes. If you have your type 2 diabetes under control and no other issue with your pancreas, would this come into play? Only a doctor can answer this. Perhaps a forum member has had this happen and would enter a thread on their history.",
