            "answer": "Yeah this would be fmla. Most companies have paperwork you would have to felt out for both which should be completed by your doctor and approved. Keep in mind most managers don't understand HR benefits. I would maybe take the approach has you are getting tired and see if they can help with tasks or breaks that give your body better rest.",

            "answer": "I don't really have vacation. Or sick days. I mostly just work weekends. I was told not to clean the top 2 shelves anymore, or to take out the big trash outside, & not to clean the overhead lamp shades. That's nice. I was thinking to ask my boss if on Saturdays I can work 9 to 5 instead of 11 to 7.",

    "question": "Okay, I know that my part time job is protected under FMLA, but my boss is saying she can give me disability if I just give a doctor note. That's nice, but technically I'm not exactly disabled... I mean, I don't have gestational diabetes, I'm not on bed rest, I don't have 24/7 morning sickness.... I'm 30 weeks & starting to feel myself slow down a lot (I am constantly on my feet for 8 hours, around 4 pm I start to slack off & sit down in the break room... I'm a receptionist & I find myself bored with tedious cleaning & can't bend down without pain anymore) so how exactly would I get disability? Wouldn't u be eligible after the birth due to c section?",
