            "answer": "I'm not a medical doc, but numerous studies have traced certain seizure disorders with diabetes. This is at least something you might want to ask her doctor about?I experienced this a couple of years ago over the course of a month or two. After all of my tests came back normal, including an EEG, I am fully convinced that these effects were due to both the use and withdrawal of Aspartame (AKA-Diet Pepsi). And it doesn't look like I'm alone if you take a peak around the internet~. I mention that only because several diabetics still do use Aspartame.I would also suggest, as a patient to patient, to read up what you can on \"P-5-P.\" Good luck.",
