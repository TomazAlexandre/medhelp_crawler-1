            "answer": "Hi Nana,I'm glad you found us at the Pain Management Forum of MedHelp. Welcome. I am sorry you have \"Foot Drop.\" It has a multitude of causes. You did not say what type of surgery you underwent that you feel caused this condition. Did you have an epidural? There are treatments for the condition and/or surgery to correct it in some cases. Foot drop should be treated.The peroneal nerve is susceptible to different types of injury. Some of these include nerve compression from lumbar disc herniation (e.g. L4, L5, S1), trauma to the sciatic nerve, spondylolisthesis, spinal stenosis, spinal cord injury, bone fractures (leg, vertebrae), stroke, tumor, diabetes, lacerations, gunshot wounds, or crush-type injuries. Drop foot is found in some patients with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Multiple Sclerosis (MS), and Parkinson's Disease. Sometimes the peroneal nerve becomes injured when stretched during hip or knee replacement surgery.The type of treatment is dependent on the underlying cause of drop foot. Some patients may be fitted with an Ankle Foot Orthosis (AFO), brace, or splint that fits into the shoe to stabilize the ankle/foot. Gait training may be incorporated into the patient's physical therapy treatment plan.Surgery may be an option to correct or alleviate the underlying problem causing drop foot. For example, if drop foot is caused by nerve compression from a lumbar herniated disc, then a spinal surgical procedure called discectomy (disc removal) may be required to relieve or 'decompress' the nerve.I do not know how the severity of your diabetes Being a diabetic you already know the importance of good foot care. Your feet should be cleansed daily. You should thoroughly examine your feet twice a day. Look for any open wounds, swelling or changes from normal. Always wear proper fitting supportive shoes, never go barefoot. If you do this you will greatly reduce the possibility of an infection that could lead to complications. Foot Drop in itself will not lead to loss of your limb.Additionally there are pain or nerve medications to control the pain associated with Drop foot (also called foot Drop). he concern is these medications can interfere with your ability to feel the pain of a small injury to the foot so again be sure to examine your feet very thoroughly. It is very important you consult with your physician. If you are not being seen by an endocrinologist you should consider making an appointment for a complete consultation.Please take care and let us know how you are doing. I wish you the very best.
