Everything is harder when you're overweight!\u00a0\u00a0Compared to my other pregnancies I didn't feel the baby move as much at first, didn't look pregnant until the third trimester,\u00a0\u00a0they couldn't see the baby well during the ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0They told me to keep my weight steady and I've been very successful doing that. It's so much more painful when I've got this much extra on top of being pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0My advice is to eat healthy best you can, go to the chiropractor to make your hips and back feel better,and walk as much as you can. I dididn't get diabetes or high blood pressure or any other risks because of my weight, thank the Lord.\u00a0\u00a0But the weight has made it very difficult thus far. I'm almost done being pregnant and I'm looking forward to being very active soon! Best of luck hun!",
