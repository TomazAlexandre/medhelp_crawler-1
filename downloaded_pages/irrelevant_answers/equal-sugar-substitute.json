            "answer": "Sugar substitute's consumed in large doses do have some carbohydrates (CHO). I just looked at our box of Sweet n Low and it said that one packet has less than one gram of sugar, sugar alcohols, and CHO. So if you had lets say 20 packets then it would add up.But I have never had a problem with sugar substitutes. i would recommend Splenda cause it is the least artificial of them all and you can measure it just like sugar when you cook.Pumpgirl03-JDRF Team-EM",

            "answer": "I have been type I for 40+ years and had my run with Sugar substitutes.I should chime in on the specific one Equal.. DO NOT use that one in hot liquids it does turn toxic.\u00a0\u00a0There is scientific reports to prove this claim.As for the rest of the bunch.. use in moderation, some people do not tolerate sugar free candies especially (can cause severe cramping) and to a lesser extent the sweetners.. Honestly I don't know anyone who's going to use 20 or more a day.. but the end result would be cramping.My experience with the candies as mentioned I can eat 4 and I get stomach cramps so bad I cannot stand up.. everyone is different.. but makes you wonder about the chemicals used to make it sugar free.",
