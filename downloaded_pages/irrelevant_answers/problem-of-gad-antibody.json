            "answer": "\"whether realy i am going to devlop type 1 diabities or else it can be controlled and will continue type II diabities\"It is difficult to respond to your post fully when you left out key information.1.) Your glucose levels - before and after meal2.) GAD lab ranges - min to max. Lab ranges can vary from lab to lab especially when its country to country. See your copy of the lab test results for ranges.3. Do you have normal weight, exercise regularly, and follow a good diabetic nutrition?Additionally1.) Have you had a C-Peptide test? (will give some indication of how much of your own insulin function remains)2.) An A1c test? (how well you control/manage your glucose [blood sugar])It should be noted that high anti-GAD antibody levels are considered markers for type 1 diabetes. When they occur in people who have what appears to be type 2 diabetes, it may indicate Latent-onset Autoimmune Diabetes of Adulthood (LADA aka Type 1.5 diabetes).See this LADA explanation.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_autoimmune_diabetesAlso these discussions on LADAhttp://tinyurl.com/diabetes-ladaAre you seeing an Endocrinologist, a diabetes specialist? LADA is relatively new where many doctors do not recognize nor fully understand how to treat it.The bottom line is that it matters most what you're doing is helping to control your diabetes.",

            "answer": "There are a lot of misunderstandings in your post and you really should speak to an endocrinologist. Type II diabetes does not \"turn into\" Type 1, though some people (myself include) are initially misdiagnosed as Type II when they are in fact LADA/Type 1.5 or just Type 1. GAD antibodies, as Waverider says indicate Type 1 (or 1.5). They do not exist in Type IIs. You don't \"reduce your GAD antibodies\", all the GAD does is indicate type. If you have the antibodies and are type 1 or 1.5 you need to be on insulin not oral meds. Again, see an endo.",

            "answer": "I don't know what your intentions were for opening these other two posts but you are creating confusion by having three posts on the same subject matter. We can follow you with just one.Here's what is suggested.1. Start a glucose [blood sugar] diary/log of EVERYTHING you eat and drink. Read about the Glycemic Index of foods. Avoid bad carbohydrates and starchy foods like potatoes. They turn into sugar after eaten.2. Test before meals and 2-3 hours after a meal [postprandial].3. If your postprandial glucose is above 10 mmol/l stop eating those foods. Too much sugar.4. Speak with your doctor about an insulin pump and/or injectable insulin. Your A1c is very high.5. Read about LADA [Latent Autoimmune Disease in Adults]. You may be a candidate. See this link http://tinyurl.com/aboutlada",
