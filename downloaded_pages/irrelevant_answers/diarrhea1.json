            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, celiac disease, crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. HIV too is a causative factor.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
