            "answer": "Hi,I would like to reassure you that your condition cannot be classified as impotence but is primariy a psychological one. Pathological reasons for failing to sustain an erection are generally seen in a much older age group. In them the likely cause is diabetes/excessive alcohol consumption/damage to the nerves/vessels.In your situation, by far the commonest reason for you to lose the erection during sex is something called performance anxiety. This is when thoughts come into your mind during the course of love-making that are sufficiently distracting and worrying for the reflexes that are necessary to sustain the erection.It\u2019s likely due to too much expectations of the partner for the sexual activity.Other sources of psychological impotence will include loss of interest in sex either as a result of a relationship problem, boredom, disinterest or just being out of love.Hope that helps. Please do keep me posted. Kind Regards.",
