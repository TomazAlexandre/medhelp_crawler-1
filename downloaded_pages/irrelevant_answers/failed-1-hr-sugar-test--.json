            "answer": "I failed both. I was upset at first but then I realized how common gestational diabetes is. But a lot of women fail the 1 hr and pass the 3. If you fail you will see a nutritionist and be taught what you can and can not eat. Low sugars and low carbs. That's The hardest part!\u00a0\u00a0And you will need too take your blood glucose 4 times a day. With my doctor the perk was I started weekly ultrasounds right away to monitor her heart, lungs, and size. As long as you exercise and follow the diet you will do great!\u00a0\u00a0Just will have a big baby.",

I am going to start adding small carbs to my meal today to see if I will spike. It's only been 4 days for me.I think part of the reason I failed was because of the food I ate the day before.",

I also have to prick my finger 4x a day and take a pill at night to keep my morning reading stable. Just like NewMom said, seeing your baby every week is a perk and I enjoy it. You can still deliver vaginally, depending on the size of the baby. Good luck, mama!",
