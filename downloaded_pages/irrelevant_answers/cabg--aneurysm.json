            "answer": "Oh my goodness, what a traumatic time for you :( I'm sorry to hear about your Father's issues. Personally I think the Cardiology team looking after your Father are making the right decisions. His three main coronary arteries all have considerable blockages. As for the Aneurysm, the Cardiologist should have explained that this will grow over time and weaken, until it reaches the point of bursting. This will obviously mean the death of your Father. I'm sure the surgeon will have done these procedures many times and the removal of the dead muscle will help the heart to work more efficiently. I know it's scary stuff. You don't state if your Father has any other medical problems, but if not then things should go quite smoothly. They will have all the right equipment in the theatre to do a good job. I have a friend who had an aneurysm removed 5 years ago, and he is doing great. His EF rose by over 10% after the repair and CABG.If you do nothing, his life is at risk.",

Yesterday after some test they discovered Aneurysm in the apex ( tip) of the heart. They now want to operate the heart also ie cut out the dead muscles. My father has a history of diabetes and hypertension (though both are under control with medication and diet control ). Please suggest whether he should undergo CABG with heart surgery or not ASAP.",
