            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.It is possible that you are suffering from neuropathy since you are complaining of burning around the lips. Did you get tested for diabetes or B12 deficiency? Since these are two important causes of peripheral neuropathy. Neuropathy can cause scalp pain as well.Since your CT scan and MRI have been normal it is very unlikely that you are suffering from any neurological disorder. Please discuss this possibility with your treating doctor and see if it helps.",
