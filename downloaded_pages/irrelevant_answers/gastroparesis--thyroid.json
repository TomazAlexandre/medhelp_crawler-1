            "answer": "A nodule would not cause gastroparesis -- an underactive thyroid could however so testing TSH, T4 and T3 would be useful -- but in most cases the nodules do not effect thyroid function.\u00a0\u00a0So regarding the nodule, if the TSH is normal, the next step is biopsy (using a very small, \"fine\" needle) -- NOT an I-123 nuclear medicine scan as if often recommended but not in the current guidelines for routine nodule evaluation.There seems to be an increase in gastroparesis that is hard to explain.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is the most common connection usually.\u00a0\u00a0But I think there may be a connection with irritable bowel and a relation to anxiety/depression in some patients -- so if this sounds right, look into these issues as well.",
