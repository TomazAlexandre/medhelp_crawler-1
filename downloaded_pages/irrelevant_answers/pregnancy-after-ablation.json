            "answer": "You said in the post that you're diabetic and have polycystic ovaries, but in the title you mention that you had an ablation?\u00a0\u00a0The diabetes would be significant in terms of safely carrying a pregnancy, but the ablation is really what would be the biggest concern.\u00a0\u00a0Did you continue to have periods after your ablation?\u00a0\u00a0If your basal endometrium was entirely destroyed, you're in a serious situation if you are pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0If you are in doubt about having the termination, the person to discuss it with is a high-risk ob-gyn or a perinatologist (and they should have all your records when talking with you).\u00a0\u00a0They are really the only one to tell you your odds of carrying a child safely.",

            "answer": "I had the same thing happen...I carried a healthy baby girl to term.\u00a0\u00a0Check with your Doc before you choose termination.\u00a0\u00a0After all I read, I too thought that was going to be my only alternative...I had really good Doc's who consulted with high risk Doc's and me and baby made it thru... Termination is final so don't rush the decision.",
