            "answer": "I don't think anyone can tell you how long before you'll need dialysis because everyone's kidney disease is different. Diabetes can definitely damage them but that does seem pretty fast especially if your sugars were under control, do you have high blood pressure? That is usually a pretty big factor in kidney disease as well and is common in diabetics. Also you might want to make sure you aren't on any nephrotoxic drugs, like ace inhibitors and fluid pills, if you are on any. Your kidneys might takes months to years to completely fail so it's hard to tell when or if youll need dialysis. Best bet is to keep the shaft under control and keep a good eye on them.",
