            "answer": "Try drinking some orange juice, or apple juice, the sugar might help you a little bit. When I get dizzy I drink some chocolate milk. Food should help too, but since it's not helping, you should call your dr to find out if what you are feling is ok or if you need to go get checked out. How is your blood pressure... because if it's on the low side that will cause dizziness too Good luck!",
