    "question": "hello, first of all just let me say thanks you for any help you can give me in advance. i was recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia, however i dont have pain when the trigger points are touched. i do have widerspread pain pretty much all over. i started having numbness in my legs and arms, even when moving. i have been dropping things a lot, but only when im not consitrating on holding something. if im paying attention i dont have any muscle weakness. my eyes only are blurry when im reading, which is new because i dont wear glasses. i have always had headaces, and neck pain. im so lost if any of these things can be fibromyalgia, or something else. i did have the basic blood work done and everything can back normal. thanks for any help you can give me!!!!!!",
