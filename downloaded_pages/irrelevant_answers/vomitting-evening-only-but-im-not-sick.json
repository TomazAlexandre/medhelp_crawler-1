            "answer": "Hello,As you may know, we're not physicians here but are volunteers with considerable experience with Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to check in with your physician if you want to follow up on any of the suggestions you read here.A coupla things come to mind, first \"still\" being stress.\u00a0\u00a0Stress itself can make some of us nauseas, myself included.\u00a0\u00a0It may also be that your digestive tract is stressed due to the daily vomiting and so its threshold for nausea is lowered for the time being.\u00a0\u00a0I'd recommend an light diet -- low in fat, clear soups, rice, crackers, chicken/fish -- not heavy meats etc. adn then gradually go back to your normal diet.\u00a0\u00a0You might wanna limit veges & fruits for a day or so, since -- while they're important components of a healthy, balanced diet -- do require \"work\" in our digestive tracts.\u00a0\u00a0Watch for patterns.Pay attention to the foods you're eating & the timing.\u00a0\u00a0Were you sitting up, lying down or just moving around like normal when the nausea hits.Other things to check out with your doc include gastric reflux and/or gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Complications affecting our digestive tract are minimized with tight control and are best treated early, so I'd recommend you work wiht your endo to identify what's going on.It looks like you're still going thru some stress, tho' the immediate crisis may have passed.\u00a0\u00a0Seeing our mom get a mastectomy & working thru recovery - both physically & emotionally - is quite a stress.\u00a0\u00a0If you're female, the stress might include new worries about your own risks for whatever resulted in her mastectomy.I hope this has been a bit of help.",

    "question": "I have been vomitting only in the evening for the past several days. I am not sick, no fever, no nausea during the day. I just all of a sudden get \"sick\", barely making it to the bathroom. I thought it may have been stress due to my mom going in for surgery (mastectomy), but she's here with me now and doing good, so I thought the vomitting would stop, but it hasn't. I've checked my urine and there is only trace ketones. My blood sugars have been okay (not perfect). I've tried to find information on webmd and other sites, but I can't find anything. Does anyone know what this could mean or experienced this themselves? I've had type I diabetes for 9 years. I haven't changed insulins or anything. Any suggestions?",
