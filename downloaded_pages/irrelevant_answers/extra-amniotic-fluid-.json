            "answer": "I had triple the normal amount when I was pregnant with my son 6 years ago. Everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, thought i was carrying twins. He was born a big healthy 9lb baby! He is now a very healthy, top of the charts, smart big boy. It does make for awesome 4d ultrasound\u00a0\u00a0pictures because of the extra fluid giving them extra room to move around. We actually got our 4d pictures for free because the tech said she likes to do them with the extra fluid. I, too, worried myself sick over the extra fluid. But try not to. I had lots of fluid the second time too with my daughter. She was born a healthy 8lb baby and is at the top of the growth chart also. Congratulations :)",
