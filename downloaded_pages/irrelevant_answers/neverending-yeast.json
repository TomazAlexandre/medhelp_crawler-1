            "answer": "It sounds like a yeast infection. I had the same issue. It took me 9 months to clear it up and now I have BV. A lot of\u00a0\u00a0women are now developing resistant strains of yeast. Sugar is what feeds yeast. I finally got rid of it by using plain yogurt (no sugar) with probiotics and taking out as much sugar as possible. It took about a month of doing that to get rid of it. I would not continue to insert your fingers either. Even if you wash your hands, you can still make or cause the yeast to return. If you are sexually active, I would suggest you not have sex as long as you have the infection. Your partner can get it and just give it back to you. Men dont even know they have a yeast infection most of the time. Air out as much as possible. Sleep without underwear. The less contact that area has with clothing the better. Some yeast infection can be caused by an allergy to certain materials. That may be another area to check out. Good luck. Yeast infections are not fun!",

            "answer": "yeah that's a good point. i had this YI for 6 months, treated it for a solid MONTH, got my period and things have been better since. Oddly, the small bits of white stuff is up and down. Every time I checked before today, I had it, but the last two times it's been clean as a whistle. I'll probably go to gyno this week to determine if i still have it. can that happen though? why would it be there one minute and gone the next?",

            "answer": "I went to the gyno and she looked under the microscope and she didn\u2019t see anything. Of course, that night, I start getting unbearable itching. I put a boric acid suppository in there. The next morning, I put my finger up there and get tons of white clumps. Of course\u2026great\u2026its\u2019 back for sure and I went to the dr. yesterday. I have done EVERYTHING to get rid of this thing. Diflucan for MONTHS, boric acid, good probiotics religiously, Apple Cider Vinegar\u2026the list goes on and on\u2026Like I mentioned, I got tested for HIV, negative, and diabetes. My doctor recently did a test to see if the cellular side of my immune system is working properly and am waiting for results. Anything else I should look into?Could the white clumps I have now be leftover boric acid? I can\u2019t handle the idea that I thought I was better for a week after 6 months of misery and it\u2019s back again. I\u2019ve done almost everything but drastically alter my diet. I drink less alcohol than I used to and try to cut back on sugars, but it\u2019s impossible to do this to the extent I probably should. Please help. I\u2019m really at the end of my rope.",

            "answer": "Hi again,So I'm wondering if my problem could be Cytolytic Vaginosis (an overgrowth of lacto-- the good bacteria). The symptoms would be the same and it would make sense in that NOTHING cures my supposed YI.I am seeing mixed reviews on whether or not the condition is real, so I was wondering if anyone else has experience. I did do 2 baths w/ baking soda and I think it may have helped a bit, but I'm not totally sure.Anyone have experience with this problem? The discharge is so uncomfortable and it looks like yeast and is itchy. My cultures never confirm yeast, so I'm really beginning to wonder.",

    "question": "6 months ago I had bacterial infection, took flagyl and got a yeast infection. That seemed normal, except I'm almost positive I've had the YI for 6 months straight. I've tried everything and I mean... EVERYTHING. Diflucan (for a full month), Terzol, Boric Acid (for a full month), probiotics, yogurt, garlic, tea tree oil, apple cider vinegar...you nane it!Went to Gyno and 3 times they looked under scope and saw yeast. When they did the culture, it was neg, but I was always using or had very recently used some form of treatment, so I think it's a false neg. The only time I get relief, amazingly, is during my period. So i was treating for a full month until my period, had my period and had no symptoms really. I thought omg, is it finally gone? Well I put my finger up in there and some white stuff was on my finger. It was semi clumpy but it was moist-ish. It wasn't quite as cottage cheesy as I've seen it, but it seems like it just started up so it might be getting worse.I thought maybe I had diabetes and was tested. I freaked about HIV dispite low risk and was negative. I'm concerned of false negative b/c of long term corticosteroids but am having some immune testing done.Do my current symptoms (the white stuff when I put my finger in there, that's moistish but semi sticks together), sound like my yeast is coming back for the 6th straight month? I don't know what else to do and all my drs are at a loss.",
