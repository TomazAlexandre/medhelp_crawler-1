            "answer": "Hello,I went through the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0Went from about 120 to 140 my first semester of college in 2005, and did not lose it permanently until 2007, and have kept it off since then.\u00a0\u00a0I did that by learning how to eat right, mostly, and slowly incorporating exercise to my lifestyle. I had to make a lot of changes, but if you just change one thing at a time before you know it you have a healthy lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you got the work out part down already, but the question remains how are you eating habits?This mostly happens to college students who were in sports in high school because you were extremely active and burning off your calories and fat up to 1 to 2 or even 3 hours a day, depending on the sport.\u00a0\u00a0Now you are probably not quite as active and eating habits may be worse.\u00a0\u00a0Lets face it, college students aren't known for eating healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I remember my 3:00 a.m. trips to Taco Bell. Working out is great and important, but the older we get its not enough.\u00a0\u00a0We have to lead a healthy lifestyle overall.A 1000 calorie fast food meal isn't gonna be made up for in a work out class that burns maybe 400-500 calories at best.... Use the food diary on this website to help you adjust your eating habits.Processed and fast food is horrible for college students.\u00a0\u00a0They are full of sodium, fat, carbs, preservatives, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Also, stay away from sugary drinks and sodas.\u00a0\u00a0According to Dr. Caroline Cederquist, women who drink sodas are at a higher risk for weight-gain, diabetes, inactivity, and smoking (http://www.bistromd.com/Soda-and-the-Effects-on-Healthy-Weight-Advice.asp). Learn to drink water and tea with none or little sugar instead.You have to find the healthiest venue available to you and use it.Its hard to change... and for some people (like me) it takes a long time but don't let it get you down... remember that habits take time to form and know your reward is a healthy life.",

    "question": "Hi,I've never used a site like this but here goes. I am\u00a0\u00a05'8 and weigh 160...I just finished my freshmen year of college and started at about 145. I've always been insecure about my body, but now it's even worse. I was so athletic in highschool, worked out everyday, but in college it was not like that AT ALL, to say the least. Anyways, I was just wondrering what you suggest I should do to lose as much weight as possible. I've been going to 45 minute spinning classes some days, others I run about two miles, and others I go to the gym (run a mile, do some lunges and squats, some machines)...What are good workouts and how can I lose the weight??Hope you can help,THANKYOU",
