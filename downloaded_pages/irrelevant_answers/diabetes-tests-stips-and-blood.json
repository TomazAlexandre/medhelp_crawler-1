            "answer": "I re-read your post and came to the conclusion that you attempted to test your glucose at home blindly. You need to see a doctor and get tested properly, get instructions on how to use your home glucose meter - what you call the \"small electronic gadget\". Learn when and how test your glucose at home and take the meter to you doctor and ask if he/she approves of it too.By the way, asking \"if i take a thorough test, will there be a chance that i have diabetes?\" is like asking if you go outside will you catch a cold. Chances are much higher for diabetes if your family has a history of diabetes, you're obese, sit on your behind all day, and your meals consist of junk sugary, bad carbohydrate foods, to name a few.",

            "answer": "Actually, the first time I took the urine test it was done blindly but then after that because my mother is in the hospital for whatever reason I visit her everyday and when I went there today I asked a nurse how to do it and so I did the test again and she told me for my satisfaction that she will take my blood test, so that was done by the nurse.Anyway, I have a pretty healthy diet. I am always on the go, not much into junk food, eat meals on time and try to work out several times a week. But since I got gum disease at such an early age without much explanation anything is possible. But I will be going for a thorough blood test on Monday in which I need to fast. I was just wanting to know the chances of having diabetes after taking the blood test and urine test.Thanks anyway!!",

            "answer": "\"I was just wanting to know the chances of having diabetes after taking the blood test and urine test.\"The urine test is one of several test indicators for diabetes. Excess glucose is sent to the kidneys to be expelled and is captured in your urine. The blood test administered by the nurse and the urine test results will depend on the last time you ate food and/or drank a colored liquid.The best test to determine whether you have diabetes or not is an A1c (HbA1c) test.

    "question": "so since i have periodontal disease at the age of 24 and it is pretty advanced, one periodontist recommended that i take a diabetes test. so i did. well i guess he meant a thorough test but that will take a few days so i bought the strips from the pharmacy myself and took the test today and it was negative. but for my self satisfaction i took the blood test not a thorough one just the one where you put a bit of blood on a strip and use some small electronic gadget and in that also my sugar level was normal. i am still slightly paranoid, so i was wondering if i take a thorough test, will there be a chance that i have diabetes?",
