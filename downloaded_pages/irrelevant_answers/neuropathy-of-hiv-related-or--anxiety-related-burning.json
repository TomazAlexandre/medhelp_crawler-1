            "answer": "Hi there. 5 weeks post possible HIV exposure would be too soon to expect an HIV related neuropathy. acute infection is often asymptomatic. seroconversion may be accompanied by a transient illness 2- 6 weeks after exposure. A period of asymptomatic infection follows though one third will have persistent generalized lymphadenopathy followed by constitutional symptoms and opportunistic infections. Acute HIV is associated with transient meningoencephalitis, myelopathy and neuropathy. You need to be checked for HIV core p24 antigen and HIV RNA by ELISA if you get negative result for HIV antibody and repeat the test at 6 weeks and 3 month to confirm or rule out. Consider other causes of neuropathy, like dietary vitamin B12 deficiency, diabetes, hypothyroidism, nerve compression due to trauma, intervertebral disc prolapsed causing nerve root compression. Hope this helps. Take care.",
