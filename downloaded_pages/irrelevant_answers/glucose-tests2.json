            "answer": "I'm sitting in the medical lab now waiting to get my blood drawn after drinking the glucose drink. I finished the drink at 7:40am and they'll draw my blood at 8:40am. I'm only 20 minutes in and even with my constant vomiting from hyperemesis It's shockingly not making me feel like I need to vomit. They gave me two flavor options...orange and fruit punch. Not that either flavor is good but at least the orange taste like a sunkist orange...so you may want to try that flavor and like the other ladies mentioned the drink is pure sugar/no caffeine.\u00a0\u00a0You'll be fine and it'll be over in a flash...just take something to occupy your time. Not to mention, the test is very critical to providing you and baby with optimal care throughout your pregnancy so I highly recommend that you take the test and some doctors will resign from treating you (at least in Michigan)\u00a0\u00a0if you refuse the test because it can be a determining factor in.a high risk or normal pregnancy and they.need to know that.Congrats on baby and best wishes!!",
