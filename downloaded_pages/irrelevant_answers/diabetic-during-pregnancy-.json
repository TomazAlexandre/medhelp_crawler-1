Every time I had to drink the \"drink\" I got sick and was sick all day.\u00a0\u00a0Actually passed out the last time. Drink extra water to flush out ur body.\u00a0\u00a0Having GD takes some of the \"fun\" so to speak outta your prego diet. Gotta watch ur cravings. But it is usually easily managed by modifying ur diet and making sure to walk daily. Any specific questions feel free to ask..I'll tell what I know from my personal experiences with GD and regular diabetes. Good luck to u all",
