I can hardly see a thing when this happens and its kinda dangerous (ive tripped opver a chair during one of these.) sometimes tehy're occompanied by dizzyness etc. I'm\u00a0\u00a0a CNA and I was thinking maybe my blood pressure is elevatd but ive been checking it regularly and check it during these spells and its normal. I don't hwat else it could be, but its starting to scare me.thanks.",
