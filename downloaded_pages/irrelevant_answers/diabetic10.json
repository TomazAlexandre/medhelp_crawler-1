            "answer": "It's in your best interest when you follow your doctors instructions.Proper nutrition means to accentuate the positive when it comes to food. I dislike the word diet. \u201cDiet\u201d implies a rigorous, self-sacrificial discipline that\u2019s doomed to fail. Instead, focus on achieving food goals of what you should eat each day rather than what you shouldn\u2019t eat. When you consume more vegetables, healthy fats [such as olive oil and nuts], lean proteins, fruits combined with low carbohydrate, low calorie, low starchy foods, your hunger will be satisfied and you will naturally want to make better choices. Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates [starches] carefully too. For example; things like breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, foods made with white flour, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. [They are converted to sugar after you eat them]. Lower your intake of man-made or prepared foods. You may jump to buy that fat free yogurt because, well, it\u2019s lower in fat but if you read the ingredient label that lower fat was substituted with higher amounts of sugar and sodium.If you have access to an Endocrinologist [a diabetes doctor] or a diabetes nurse, or a diabetes trained nutritionist in the Maldives they can help you a lot with nutritional guidelines. [Serving sizes, and how many servings of each type food that's safe for you.]",
