    "question": "Hi All,For the past four months I have been battling a medical mystery - severe fatigue, low body temperature, headaches, high blood pressure, and assorted back and body pains; previous to Oct 22, 2012, my BP had historically been 110-120/80 and I never had headaches. I was a rock-solid 98.6 body temp previously but now average about 96.3. I've gained over 15 pounds as well.I've heard a spectrum of possible diagnoses from West Nile Virus to Lymphoma, each ruled out, over the past months. The doctors are baffled, I've been seen by a highly regarded infectious disease specialist, a cardiologist, and been to a sleep study.I've been told that my thyroid lab work is \"normal\" but from what I have read, my signs and symptoms could very well point to a thyroid issue. Any thoughts or feedback on what would account for my conditions are most welcome! Thanks!All the Best - Bert (aoh3)",
