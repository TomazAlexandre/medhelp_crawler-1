            "answer": "I was in the same boat as you but I got like that once I found out I was diagnosed with it. I was terrified to eat anything because I was afraid of how it would affect my baby. Once I met with a diabetic expert and a dietician I felt more then 100% better. She explained it with more detail and explained how it affects myself and my baby. She also helped me with a meal plan, a grocery list, and gave me tons of recipes. What matters is the total carbohydrates! I kept looking at the sugar... which is important too! But when I plan my meals out during the day I can only have so many carbs at one time. For breakfast I can only have 25 total carbohydrates. For snacks (you should have three snacks a day including one before bed) no more then 30. For lunch and dinner no more then 45. I have to test my sugars four times a day and with my diet they haven't been bad at all! Good luck and don't worry its not that bad at all and if you have it it goes away after pregnancy usually. If I can help you in any way like sharing with you my meal plan or some good ideas I'll be happy to help just message me.",

            "answer": "When they took your urine did they find sugar in it ? Like before a month before you took the test? they found traces of sugar in my urine and supposedly that doesn't happen unless you have something like gestational diabetes.. Thank you so much I'm feeling a lot better because I know a lot of people who have it now but yes I'd love to hear your meal plans ! Just so if it does turn out I have it I can be prepared",
