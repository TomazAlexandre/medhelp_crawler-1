I have an 8 year old little boy and will be delivering my little girl Tuesday morning.I have been counting down the days and hours of the end of this pregnancy, but now I must say it's bittersweet.I am having my tubes tied as I know that I do not want anymore children since this was so bad.I think it's finally hitting me that I'm never going to experience this again.I cannot wait to meet my little girl but I think I'm going to cherish this last 24 hours.",
