            "answer": "I have found that exercise is really benefical in controlling my diabetes. Within a few hours of exercise I notice that my blood sugar has deceased. Overall my endocronologist has been able to take me off 1 of my medications, and possible the other as long as I am able to control the blood sugar levels with diet and exercise. I like to switch up my exercise routine and will walk, swim, bike, pilates, and yoga. Best of luck!",

            "answer": "Like foods, there are different types of exercises that affect the body differently by how they are performed. The key is to start slow and easy then build up the routine over time. Increase time and motion only when your body feels comfortable doing so. With continuous moderate exercise your muscles use up excess glucose. However, strenuous exercise can have the opposite effect as your body may release stress hormones that tells your body to release available glucose for energy.1. That last 10 minutes may have jacked up your glucose as this falls under strenuous exercise, that is, unless this has been your normal routine for months on end.2 & 3 - Good start4. Eat after exercising not before. While you exercise you're burning off glucose from the food you just ate not what has been stored in your body. Wait at least 30-45 minutes so your body can come to a rest then eat after you finished exercising. You'll find that you'll eat less doing it this way. Drink only water too.5. One hr after eating your glucose is still on the rise. If you must eat b4 aim for 2.5 hrs then start your exercise.6. Let your body come to a rest and the adrenaline dissipate b4 testing. I use to test 30 minutes later after cooling down.Walking or yoga? Both. Walking to me is boring. I always do yoga like stretches b4 I jump on my road bicycle. Sometimes I do Tai-chi-chuan after yoga. I get my exercise by biking on avg 150-200 miles a week. The key is to slowly build up your exercise routine so that you don't make it strenuous. Diabetic weight lifters have a hard time at this. Amy has the right idea by mix matching her exercise programs. HTH",

They are always so detailed and useful.It is good to know that strenuous exercise can have the opposite effect.I\u00b4ll take the advice on waiting at least 30 minutes after eating to start exercising.Yes, doing both (walking and yoga) might be a good idea.",

    "question": "I have read so many times, on the power of exercise in controlling diabetes 2. But I want to know more what exactly exercise does concerning this topic. Does exercise improves insulin sensitivity???? Does exercise lower blood sugar levels?I asked you this, because today, I measured my sugar levels before and after exercising an the number was the same. It made me doubt if it really did have any effect on my sugar levels.",
