            "answer": "Chloy,Are you going to the appointment with your sister?You should ask the neurologist if your sister may have Cushing's Syndrome.Risk factorsThe following factors have been associated with pseudotumor cerebri:* Obesity* Medications such as tetracycline, tamoxifen, lithium and corticosteroids* Too much vitamin A* Cushing's syndrome* Underactive parathyroid glandsWhat are the signs and symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome?Signs and symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome vary, but most people with the disorder have upper body obesity, a rounded face, increased fat around the neck, and relatively slender arms and legs.Other signs appear in the skin, which becomes fragile and thin, bruises easily, and heals poorly.Purple or pink stretch marks may appear on the abdomen, thighs, buttocks, arms, and breasts.The bones are weakened, and routine activities such as bending, lifting, or rising from a chair may lead to backaches and rib or spinal column fractures.Women with Cushing\u2019s syndrome usually have excess hair growth on their face, neck, chest, abdomen, and thighs.Their menstrual periods may become irregular or stop.Other common signs and symptoms include* severe fatigue* weak muscles* high blood pressure* high blood glucose* increased thirst and urination* irritability, anxiety, or depression* a fatty hump between the shouldersSometimes other conditions have many of the same signs as Cushing\u2019s syndrome, even though people with these disorders do not have abnormally elevated cortisol levels.For example, polycystic ovary syndrome can cause menstrual disturbances, weight gain beginning in adolescence, excess hair growth, and impaired insulin action and diabetes.Metabolic syndrome\u2014a combination of problems that includes excess weight around the waist, high blood pressure, abnormal levels of cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood, and insulin resistance\u2014also mimics the symptoms of Cushing\u2019s syndrome.Sources:http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov/pubs/cushings/cushings.htm#treatmenthttp://www.ohiohealth.com/bodymayo.cfm?xyzpdqabc=0&id=6&action=detail&ref=3203Let us know what the doctor says.Wishing you the best,Carol",
