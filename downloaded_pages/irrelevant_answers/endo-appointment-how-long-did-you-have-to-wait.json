    "question": "I finally convinced my GP that I really can't be relying on the surgeon's dumbness anymore and that I should see an endocrinologist. He gave me a referral to an allegedly ( I just love that word!) good one. I looked him up on the net, and he is, indeed, a very good one. Doing research into thyroid disorders and also trying to find a way to give diabetes an inhaler rather than the needles. He says on the web that too many diabetics have a stigma against them fromthe public as they look like 'druggies'. I thought that all that was a positive, so I rang to get an appointment.15 October is the first available! I said, I don't think I can last that long. The receptionist told me I could see someone in Melbourne ( a two and half hour drive from me!) but I might not get in there till late August. I'll be in USA by then....sigh....My question! How long did it take you guys to get to see an endo? I feel that in this country they are few and far between, and the ones that are good, obviously are going to be booked up solid.",
