May I ask too if you have had any kidney trouble, gallbladder?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your time.",

            "answer": "I do have to follow a strict low fat diet, no more than 20 fat grams daily.\u00a0\u00a0No oils, butter, fried food or alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0I suffered periodic episodes of abdominal cramping, slight pain behind the sternum, and then very occasional nausea or vomiting for a few months prior to my acute attack.\u00a0\u00a0I was also frequently fatigued.\u00a0\u00a0They did several ultrasounds, bloodtests and CT-scans immediately following my attack, and my kidneys and gallbladder looked fine, both in the ultrasounds and scans.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately I have not developed diabetes at this point, yet that could happen in the future.Good luck to you.\u00a0\u00a0I hope a specialist can get to the root of your problem, and you can get the appropriate treatment.",
