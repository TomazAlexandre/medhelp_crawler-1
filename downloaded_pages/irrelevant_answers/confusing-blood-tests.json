            "answer": "My knee clicked so loudly for days whenever i walked. Thankfully i knew what the problem was since i had severe magnesium deficiency years ago and other joints were affected although i had to crack them a lot instead but if it is to do with joints you want to give magnesium a try. Three days of magnesium and voila clicking gone. Symptoms of magnesium deficiency are numerous but includes high blood pressure, excessive urination, pain, fatigue. The liver contains no nerve endings so pain is rarely a symptom of liver problems.http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Heart-Rhythm/Magnesium-supplements----to-avoid---how-to-take-it-and--safety/show/1002415",

            "answer": "I keep developing magnesium deficiency due to severe insulin resistance.\"In diabetes mellitus, it is suggested that low intracellular magnesium levels result from both increased urinary losses and insulin resistance.\"I believe H1c is short for HbA1c which tests for diabetes. Between 6 and 6.5 is considered pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Unless H1c stands for something else, you have pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is one of the listed causes for high ferritin and high protein so your labs most likely all lead back to high insulin levels.Keep an eye out for fluid retention/swelling as that is the first clue your kidneys can't handle magnesium supplementation. I can't take magnesium everyday as severe insulin resistance for over a decade has done some damage to my kidney. But i did take magnesium for three days to get rid of my clicking knee. :)",

            "answer": "Thanks again for your comments. =) My doc told me I am pre-diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I try to eat healthy, but it doesn't seem to be making a difference. I don't have diabetes in my family...As far as the iron goes, he told me to take a supplement. Everything I have read online concerning high ferritin along with poor saturation says NOT to take supplements. I know I get plenty of iron in my diet, so I've decided not to take the supplements. Now I'm a little wary of taking magnesium because I already have problems with fluid retention. I tend to limit my carbs, because that seems to be one of the causes of fluid retention. Every time I eat simple carbs, I feel really bad the next day.....I had some epsom salts so soaked in the tub with that added. I woke up during the night with horrible pain in my kidney area on both sides. I don't know if that caused it or not.",

            "answer": "Magnesium is needed to control insulin. A catch 22!\u00a0\u00a0I am thinking of purchasing green coffee bean extract which is shown to lower insulin after eating. I worsened my insulin resistance to pre-diabetes due to overmedication with thyroid medication. Thyroid hormone also affects insulin. Symptoms improved lowering medication again. No more burning tongue or severe sudden fatigue where i crash and need sleep ASAP!I have fluid retention badly from my hypothyroidism (still trying to sort out treatment and this is no picnic - getting on for almost a year and a half now!). A bit of fluid retention from my kidney issues too no doubt.Statin drugs (lowers cholesterol) black box warning is high blood sugar and type 2 diabetes. I hope you aren't on that drug!\u00a0\u00a0Zero benefit to women in any age group!All carbs turn to insulin. High carb diets is why there is a epidemic of obesity and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a050% of diabetics die of heart disease. And that is the power of high insulin. Fat, diabetic and heart attack on a plate. I am so reversing this!",
