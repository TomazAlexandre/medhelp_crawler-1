    "question": "How do I go about getting help for myself when my husband, parents, all look down on people with mental problems? I know that I need help desparately considering I am constantly thinking of ways to end my life and have become a prisoner in my basement so much as to become vitamin D deficient. There is no way that I could even suggest to them that I might need help. So in the meantime, I just withdrawal more and more and feel so guilty about it when my children ask me why I don't spend time with them anymore.",
