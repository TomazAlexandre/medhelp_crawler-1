You are already not in a physical or financial position to take on another person and I worry about what the stress of a pregnancy would do to you as far as the pain of fibromyalgia goes. I'd make the difficult but understandable choice of having an abortion. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hey my aunty was in the same boat as you. She ignored her Dr as our family don't believe in abortions unless there's something wrong with the baby. Babies are blessings from God. A little gift. I believe you was given another chance. If you have support from your family then you should be fine. I would get a second opinion from other Dr. Babies didn't ask to be born its a little sad though.",
