            "answer": "the left lower chamber of the heart has the strongest contractions coz it pumps the blood to all the vital organs.. that's why we feel the heartbeat more intensely on the left\u00a0\u00a0side while the heart is centrally located.. so it is very possible that the left arm is at a closer vicinity to the heart and hence the the bp is more for the left arm as compared to the right arm.. good luck..",

            "answer": "Not to scare you, but, I did a google check, here is what the Mayo Clinic says about it:Generally, a small difference in blood pressure readings between arms isn't a health concern. However, a difference of more than 20 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) for systolic pressure (top number) or more than 10 mm Hg for diastolic pressure (bottom number) may be a sign of an underlying problem \u2014 such as narrowing of the main arteries to that arm. If you have a significant difference in blood pressure readings between arms, talk to your doctor.Your doctor may measure your blood pressure in both arms to see if you have high blood pressure (hypertension). If your blood pressure is higher in one arm, your doctor will probably use the blood pressure reading from that arm to monitor your blood pressure.A large difference in blood pressure measurement between your arms could signal a health problem, such as:\u25a0Blocked arteries in your arms (peripheral artery disease)\u25a0Kidney disease\u25a0Diabetes\u25a0Heart defects",
