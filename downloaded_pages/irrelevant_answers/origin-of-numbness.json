            "answer": "There are lots of posts on this site about numbness and tingling and the causes.Lots saying they thought they had MS.I have been worried about this also. It all started about a year ago. I was experiencing pain in my lower back. I had an ultrasound scan and it was clear.Few months went by, just taking painkillers, then I started experiencing tingling.numbness down my right thigh. I ws advised to have an x ray of my lower back as GP thought it could be related, ie a nerve compression or something.X ray normal. mystery continued!Had blood tested and was B12 deficient so now take supplements. numbness in leg has improved immensley, however I get numb arms during the night and the feeling takes ages to come back and it wakes me up. not sure what this is. also suffer from on/off vertigo! as does my Mother. She also experiences numbness down one arm and pain in the shoulder.argh! what could this be.",

            "answer": "Hi there. Causes of numbness in the arm include extreme cold, any arm injury sustained during rigorous workout, myxedema, diabetes, angina, pernicious anemia, pyridoxine deficiency etc. consult a neurologist immediately for evaluation and workup. Also cervical intervertebral disc prolapse or degeneration may be causing this as part of cervical myelopathy so an MRI neck is also warranted. Hope this information helps. Take care.",

    "question": "Last night I retire to sleep at 10:30pm and woke at 1.00 am to realize my right arm was completely flacidand I had to hit it for about 35 seconds to get blood circulation back. It happened again at 2:30 amat 7.00 am and 8.00 am after dosing off. I thought I was having a stroke. Last week I did alot of weightlifting doinghack squats and leg presses. Could it be a nerve; or was I losing circulation to limb.\u00a0\u00a0 funnyguy790This discussion is related to/posts/show/297093.",
