    "question": "hi im having a bit of anxiety bout a situation sorry if its a long read but advice would be very much appreciated. im a tattoo artist an juss had a situation with pricking myself on the tip of my thumb with a needle ( which was actually 5 fine needles grouped together for a larger line ) i stopped tattooing after removed my gloves an applied pressure to see if it broke skin indeed i had a small small amount of blood so i applied more pressure an pushed out a bit more blood then cleaned the area with alcohol. after changed out all my utensils an replaced everything new. i asked my client if i\u00a0\u00a0had anything to worry about wich course they replied with no that i had nothing to worry about an that they where checked for diabetes in the last three month . but course i still have anxiety bout how high my risks are of any infection. specially reading so many different opinions on the net some say no real risk some say theres a high risk. im juss tryng too not freak out if i could get some real advice for my situation i think it would put me in a better state of mind. thank you",
