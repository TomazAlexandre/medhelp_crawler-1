            "answer": "Partially solid and partially vascular (which sounds like a complex cyst with vascular involvement) is more worrisome for malignancy.\u00a0\u00a0A solitary nodule is also more concerning.\u00a0\u00a0Being a male and all also puts you at much higher risk.\u00a0\u00a0So does being over 40 (okay, I know - you are just *barely* over).\u00a0\u00a0Growing up where you did puts you at *huge* risk (see my off-line message to you).Here's a web site that helped me understand what I was facing, maybe it will help you too:http://www.endocrineweb.com/thyroid.htmlIn addition to seeing an endocrinologist (one who specializes in thyroids - not just diabetes) you may want to start researching some good surgeons in your area - make sure that they have done *lots* of thyroid surgeries.If you are ever thinking of visiting back here in Utah for thyroid treatment, let me know, I have a great surgeon and endo.\u00a0\u00a0:-)\u00a0\u00a0(yeah, I know, a LONG way to go for treatment)",

    "question": "I was diagnosed 8 weeks ago with a mass on my Thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0At that time the ultrasound showed a 3 cm mass.\u00a0\u00a0They did a fine needle biopsy a few days later and the result was inconclusive.\u00a0\u00a07 weeks after the first ultrasound I had another one which showed that the mass has grown or swollen to 4 cm.\u00a0\u00a0The ENT Doctor that I am seeing says that the growth could be from bleeding from the fine needle biopsy or the mass is growing.\u00a0\u00a0He suggested that I get a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0He is an older doctor, very nice but I get the impression that he lacks specific knowledge on Thyroid conditions.Is there a Doctor who is monitoring this forum that could give me a suggestion?\u00a0\u00a0Does what this doctor say make sense?\u00a0\u00a0Obviously I am going to find another doctor who speciallizes in the Thyroid but in the mean time I am currious if this sounds like a cancer or not and if I should \"hurry\" to find a doctor who can definatively diagnose this and start treatment.Thanks",
