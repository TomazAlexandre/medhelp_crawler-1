    "question": "I am a 17 yr old female who's having some problems. I am normally healthy. But for the past few months I've been having a \"bottomless pit\" feeling in my stomach. If I don't eat for about an hour my stomach starts to hurt. After I eat a bigger meal I feel like I'm starving and I get very shaky. But I'm bloated. For the past couple of weeks I've been feeling like I'm going to throw up. This feeling is nonstop. I've been lightheaded and had headaches. My lower stomach hurts as well. I constantly feel tired. I have acid reflux that burns my throat and comes up into my mouth. I've taken tums but it doesn't help. None of this will go away and it's scaring me. A lot of times I will hurt under my ribs it's like a stabbing pain and where my stomach is there's a burning pain. This has been going on for a while. I go to the restroom regularly. It's not constipation. Does anybody out there have any advice on what this could be?? Also it's not growing pains. I havnt grown in 5 yrs. I'm not gaining or losing weight.",
