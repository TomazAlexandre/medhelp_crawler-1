            "answer": "Hi,I am sorry that you are having to suffer so much. I understand that not knowing the diagnosis of your medical condition can be frustrating. However, you definitely seem to have a neuropathic pain. Obviously this is not the diagnosis but just the symptom per se\u00a0\u00a0for which a cause needs to be determined. However, the worsening of the pain during night is classical of neuropathic pain and that is just the way it is. You also mention additional symptoms including motor symptoms which in a nutshell seem to suggest presence of central nervous system involvement and not just peripheral nerves. The exact pattern of neurological symptom involvement needs to be considered but caries of the spine which is a common condition associated with aging might be the cause. Radiological investigations such as CT or an MRI of the spine will be helpful. A work up by an expert neurologist would be in order.I do hope you have been screened for diabetes and you are not having uncontrolled high blood sugars.",

            "answer": "Hi and thank you for your response.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes and have had four MRI's, an EMG, EEG, & Evoked Potential Test.\u00a0\u00a0I do have minor spinal stenosis, but that is part of the aging process.\u00a0\u00a0It is not enough to cause the multiple symptoms listed above.\u00a0\u00a0At first they thought it may be ALS, but Thank God that has been ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0They also suspected an Upper Motor Neuron disorder and think that my neurons are misfiring. Getting out of the car or off the couch is difficult because of the left sided weakness. I try to cope with these symptoms and realize that I have had 55 good years and that there are many people out there far worse then I am.\u00a0\u00a0But what really bothers me is that you don't have any control over your symptoms, nor do you know when your leg will just give out on you, or that the leg cramps will drive you crazy. I envy my husband who power naps all evening on the couch and then can go to bed and sleep another seven hours.\u00a0\u00a0I stay up until after one o'clock as it is useless trying to go to bed to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I have a bed full of pillows as I have to rest my legs and arms on them.\u00a0\u00a0I guess what I miss most is being able to sleep through the night and feel restored in the morning, or just being able to go for a walk without worrying about falling or losing your balance.\u00a0\u00a0My ANA levels were elevated and I retain fluid and have inflammation throughout my body.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect my allergies are involved somehow\u00a0\u00a0and the rash and low-grade fever I had my have been a post viral reaction which attacked my immune system.\u00a0\u00a0However, none of this shows up on any medical tests so it is only a guess on my part.\u00a0\u00a0Some days are better then others but the leg pain is constant. It is like having a gnawing\u00a0\u00a0toothache, which flares up in the night.\u00a0\u00a0 I was a very active person prior to this disorder and I try to stay as active as I can.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, I find it better if I keep moving to alleviate the stiffness.\u00a0\u00a0My aquatic exercises help in this regard as I get a full body workout, which is beneficial and therapeutic.\u00a0\u00a0I also find that TENS treatment, accupunture and physiotherapy help as well.\u00a0\u00a0I have learned to accept my condition, but still don't know how it will affect me in the future.",

    "question": "Does anybody have the feeling of burning pain in parts of your body that you haven't hurt or can explain. Last week for about three days I had to leave my bra off as the whole ribcage on one side was on fire. Sometimes it will be the top of my hands or the palms, or the fingers will feel like they are being squeezed in a vice.\u00a0\u00a0I am used to the numbness and feeling that my foot is dead, but this burning pain just overwhelms me.\u00a0\u00a0Why is it that all these symptoms are more magnified at night?. I am still undiagnosed after five years, all we know is that it is a central nervous system disorder.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have Lyme, or low B12.\u00a0\u00a0My condition is not life threatening, but it has surely affected my quality of life where you live with constant chronic pain 24/7.\u00a0\u00a0The other symptoms affect my balance, uneven gait, weakness, tingling, stuttering, leg cramping and hyper reflexes and startle response.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The internal vibrations seem to have improved but there are some days that I am just so weak and overwhelmed, that it is very frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0I had a cancer scare last winter when I underwent breast surgery and had a colonscopsy for unexplained blood loss, but that has been resolved. The cyst was benign and the blood loss was due to a giant para-esphophical hernia.\u00a0\u00a0Other then taking meds for blood pressure and cholesterol , which are very low doses, I only take Gabepentin to treat my neurological symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0MS does run in my mother's side of the family, but it was her aunts and cousins.\u00a0\u00a0Not having an explanation for your symptoms or their cause can be very frustrating and you don't know what the future holds.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have depression, nor do I suffer from anxiety, phobias or addictions. I am a 60 year old grandmother who looked forward to Freedom Fifty Five but instead my free care lifestyle ended.",
