    "question": "HiI've been having symptoms of paresthesia in my feet, legs and left hand/arm for the past 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0I also have some numbness in my little toe on my left foot and sporadic pain in the left foot.I used to run a lot, but find that if I run at all, I get pains in my left foot and it takes me days for them to return to the level they were before the run.The parasthesia in my feet tends to be worse when wearing socks and shoes.\u00a0\u00a0I also have good days and bad days.\u00a0\u00a0A good day is where I almost don't notice it, but it is always there. A bad day is when it drives me to distraction and causes me to become quite stressed.I've had a brain, cervical and thoracic mri and all where clear.\u00a0\u00a0I've had 2 emg's, and both were clear.\u00a0\u00a0I've had all kinds of prodding and other tests by my neurologist and all were fine.\u00a0\u00a0I've had pretty much every blood test the Drs. can think of and all have come back negative (b12, diabetes, lymes, syphilis etc.)My Neurologist has discharged me for now, and said he didn't think it was anything nasty like MS or diabetes. He did mention Poly Neuropathy but I'm said he only suspected that and didn't seem sure.\u00a0\u00a0Particularly as the Emg's couldn't find anything.I'm male and in my early 40's.\u00a0\u00a0I'm otherwise quite fit as I have trained for and ran several triathlons over the past few years.Has anybody had similar symptoms and had a diagnosis of some kind?\u00a0\u00a0I'm still concerned it could be MS, and being over 40 I'm also worried that the prognosis for this age group is less favourable.",
