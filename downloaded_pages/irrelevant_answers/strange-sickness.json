            "answer": "These symptoms have existed for 4 years. I have been to the GP, was given ati boitics, they did not help. RPR, HIV/AIDS and urine test were done but were all negative. I then went to the Physician who recommended a more comprehensive approach of blood taste. He detected that i have an allergy because he also realised that i have a hole in my stomach. He said my body is reacting. He gave me anti biotics which i am busy taking, i feel better but not cured,i have been taking them for a month now. I should take them repeatatively for 6 months. My concern is that i my symptoms seem like STI's, syphyllis in particular.",
