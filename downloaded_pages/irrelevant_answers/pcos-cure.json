She died at age 58 from heart disease.I too have PCOS, but I have type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0After years of dealing with low blood sugar and many other debilitating symptoms, including fatigue and severe PMS, I became diabetic overnight.I'm sorry to say that there is no cure for PCOS. It can only be treated. They say to go on a proper diet and exercise, and that's healthy and good advice, but personally, I've never found diet or exercise to keep the condition in check.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a vegan, BTW.\u00a0\u00a0The thing that has worked best for me were birth control pills. Glucophage didn't work for me either and made me very ill from a condition called lactic acidosis.You should pick up Dr. Vliet's book about PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0It's the most helpful source I've ever found.Good luck in managing your problem.I hope you find the answer you need to get your condition in check.\u00a0\u00a0Just don't give up hope.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there. :-)Bobette",

    "question": "My doc say that I have PCOS, irregular periods ( from childhood), metabolic syndrome and other symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0It's seems to be hereditary.\u00a0\u00a0She prescribed Glucophage, and I took 2 tab each 500 for a year.\u00a0\u00a0Did not cure me, infact I felt worst.\u00a0\u00a0I also have high cholesterol, but don't eat meat and jog 3 miles almost 5 times a week.\u00a0\u00a0I am prediabetic and very likely to get heart disease stroke and other fatal complications as I grow older.Please advise me how to cure PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any way to reduce testerone level, which seems to be the root cause.\u00a0\u00a0All I am doing right now is controlling symptoms by trying to reduce insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0But that is not a permanent cure.Does exercising, weight lifting increase testerone production in my body? I need correct answers.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise, how I can reduce testerone level and eliminate PCOS from the root.",
