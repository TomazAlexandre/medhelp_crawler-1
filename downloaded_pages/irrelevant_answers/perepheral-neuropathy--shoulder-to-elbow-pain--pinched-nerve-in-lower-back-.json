            "answer": "The large scale medical studies performed to date, have shown that tight and consistent control of blood sugar, will reduce the risk or possibly progression of diabetic neuropathy.

            "answer": "Do you have a regular doctor whom you see to oversee your general health?\u00a0\u00a0If so, have you discussed these health issues? Many of them could be caused or made worse by your diabetes, especially if your blood glucose levels are not well controlled.\u00a0\u00a0If controlling the diabetes doesn't reduce or eliminate your symptoms, you may need referral to specialists, but I think talking to your doctor and controlling your blood sugar are the first thingss to take care of.Jeff",
