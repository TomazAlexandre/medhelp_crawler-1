You won't know the weight until your baby is born.\u00a0\u00a0Those ultrasounds\u00a0\u00a0can be off by a couple pounds. ..so your baby could only weigh 6 pounds right now. You don't really have a choice but to wait it out.",

In any position besides your back your chances of tearing go down so much.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it's good to induce for what you've said. I'm sure it will all work out fine.\u00a0\u00a0Stay positive!",

I had to be induced due to pre eclampsia and i really wish i hadnt been. I wish he could have had those extra 3 weeks even though i was extremely miserable - i couldn't even get out of bed - just wait it out and let him come when he is ready. 8lbs is not a big baby.",

I don't have the extra fluid but my baby is measuring big and has a bigger belly and I was told it was due to my gestational diabetes, but that he is just fine just a bigger baby. And because of his bigger size and the diabetes they are inducing me tomorrow because my dr. Says bigger baby's can get stuck, or have birth injuries or other complications. I'm not sure what your situation is, but most Dr.s will induce or c section if your baby ends up being too big. Ultrasounds can be off up to 2 pounds. With my first son they told me all the time he was gonna be this Biggs baby, but he only weighed 7 lbs 10oz. I do feel the baby I'm carrying now is bigger than my first and I'm sure he is but we won't know for sure till he is out. Try not to worry, and talk about your concerns with dr. Good luck and congrats!",
