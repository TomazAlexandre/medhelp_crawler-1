            "answer": "Dear Danielle,As you may know, we are volunteers here and not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0We are alsmo most versed in Type 1 diabetes, based on our personal experiences.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to check out whatever you read here or elsewhere on the Internet with a physician who knows your husband's particulars.My first suggestion is that you be sure to work with an Endocrinologist and not a 'GP' for treatment of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0An endocrinologist is a specialist who treats this type of disease.\u00a0\u00a0A person with Type 2 often has the added issue of being overweight.\u00a0\u00a0If that is your hubby's case, encourage him to work with his doc on a safe lifestyle change that can result in weight loss and improved muscle tone.Blood sugar fluctuations by themselves can cause emotional fluctuations, and it is not uncommon for folks with chronic illnesses to also develop clinical depression.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I encourage you to work with him and his doctor(s) ... If you have any doubts about your current physicians, ask for 2nd opinions.Finally I want to tell you that you seem to be a wonderful support for your hubby.\u00a0\u00a0While currently he may not be able to verbalize his appreciation for your concern, and your pro-active involvement, I'm sure he feels it.\u00a0\u00a0All of us who have family support are quite grateful for it -- even on our bad days.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the info!I have been around Diabetis forever.\u00a0\u00a0My father has had since he was 17 nad my sister was diagnosed at 13. Both are now on the pump. They love it.As far as my husband.......he found at at 27 and is now 31.\u00a0\u00a0I think his ENDO stinks and we are switching.\u00a0\u00a0Listen to all of his meds:6 pills in the morning (actos, metaformin, glipizide, etc.). 23U Lantus at night and he just added Humalog (i think that's it).\u00a0\u00a0He takes this after each meal.Don't you think that is a little insane?He is a picture -perfect diabetic (so the docs day).He is 31, 175lbs and 6' tall.He was 205 and then all of the sudden lost 30lbs. (Diabetis)The doc has said he may be on the verge of a type 1.The worst part is that he has good and bad weeks. It is never consistant.Any thoughts.......",

            "answer": "I'm a 29-year old Type I diabetic who was diagnosed at age 9...I was reading Danielle's comments and wanted to point out one thing that made a HUGE difference in my blood sugar monitoring...I'd hate for anyone else to make the same mistake that I did...Make sure that the vials of insulin are changed every 28 days.\u00a0\u00a0When I first started using Lantis, I didn't realize that the shelf-life was only 28 days which was quite different than my previous insulins.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed that after the 29th or 30th day, my blood sugar readings shot completely out of control.It sounds like Danielle is quite supportive and I wish her the best of luck:-)",

            "answer": "I had a very similar episode after I was on Lantus for a couple of years.\u00a0\u00a0I couldn't understand what was happening as it was so unpredictable, even with a new bottle every month.\u00a0\u00a0It was working so well for me previously.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a new endo about a year ago, and he suggested I try Levemir instead of the Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0Once I started the Levemir, I noticed a marked improvement with more consistent bg levels.\u00a0\u00a0I am a Type 1 diagnosed at 33, and I am 10 years into the disease.\u00a0\u00a0I take sliding Humalog and 12 U Levemir at bed.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.",
