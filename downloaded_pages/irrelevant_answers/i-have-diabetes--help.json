            "answer": "\"Please tell me in my case\u00a0\u00a0is diabetes one of the diseases that can be controlled easy ?'Depends on what is easy to you. It's easy for most of us but not for some as the latter do not want to make lifestyle changes. Your current blood glucose ranges have entered the danger zone. Unless you make lifestyle changes severe complications are soon to follow. Medication alone will not arrest this disease. It takes you to follow and adhere to diabetic guidelines by maintaining and keeping your weight at normal levels, doing physical exercise 3x4 times a week, and avoiding sugary and high carbohydrate foods. You can start by educating yourself about diabetes control and management by using Google search. A good place to start is the American Diabetes Association [ADA].",
