            "answer": "That is a really interesting concept. But, as you say, does something show up in the blood that could be monitored? Glucose levels rise and fall all day for everyone and the Continuous Glucose Monitors are helpful for people who can't seem to figure out why their body does what it does. It works for people taking insulin and those who don't. It is usually used with an insulin pump, though, which is like a robotic pancreas. Maybe they could invent a robotic nerve system to make our synapses fire properly? That would be tough. :(",

            "answer": "Bipolar is an imbalance between the neurotransmitters so this most likely won't happen. It is true that they will continue to develop safer and more effective medications that are targeted to the specific neurotransmitters. And they are researching how to specifically understand what medication would be right for a particular person. However, I don't believe there is any research in that direction or an understanding that it could be treated that way. I do know that the FDA approved vagus nerve stimulation to treat depression but it has not proven that successful so far.",

            "answer": "I heard in one of the TV channels can't remember which, that nanotechnology will soon be used to target a certain cell only (cancer say) instead of spreading the meds in all parts of the body causing side effects or liver problems.But what i meant is different. When I am having mixed states, it's my parents who reach for the seroquel to give it to me while i am in a total mess. So since one day I shall be living alone who will be around me to call my doctor or give me the meds. This is why sometimes I am surprised to see some on this forum living alone and manage their illness by themselves. My pdocs keep telling me with time I shall expect how my mood will change and be \"en guarde\" but I was never able to make it, it's always a member in the family who helps. That is why I thought of a device which works automatically while my brain is not there",

            "answer": "I was talking to my husband about this and he says the hard this is that people with bipolar react to what is going on around them as well as what is going on inside. For example, a person with diabetes can say \"I won't eat that cake,\" but we can't say \"my co-worker won't be in a bad mood and say angry words at me today.\" Do you see? Just like that would bring down a non-bipolar person, it could be the thing that pushes a bipolar person over the edge. But there is not way to guard or predict it, like a continuous glucose monitor would be able to say \"you're blood glucose is already too high right now.\"Does that make sense?But, I see why you are concerned. I also don't know when my episodes are coming. They hit me so fast. I don't know if it is because of rapid cycling or what. I guess that's why they have us do mood trackers. Maybe to find a pattern? Maybe you could journal? I know it is hard when you're in the middle of either cycle sometimes you can't tell how bad you are. Actually, I never realize it until later. :(It is a good idea, if only they knew how to do it. My cousin is a physicist. Maybe I could ask him next time I talk to him. He works with nano-physics.",

    "question": "I am dreaming that one day they will invent a device to control it, exactly similar to the one monitoring the ammount of sugar in the blood in diabetic people (Melitus) by insulin infusion. Since they like to compare BP to diabetes as a life long disease then why not what applies here applies there. A surplus of sugar destroys as well as less sugar gives coma, etc... same thing for the receptors to inject either AP's when manic and AD's when depressed based on the quantity in the blood. I assume what delays such invention is that BP doesn't show in the blood like sugar, UNFORTUNATELY",
