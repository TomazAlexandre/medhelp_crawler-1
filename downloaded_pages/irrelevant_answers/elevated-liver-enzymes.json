            "answer": "Hi, I have all the same problems that you do.\u00a0\u00a0elevated liver enzymes, fatty liver, and im also a new onset diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0mine is totally diet controled for the past 4 months.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost 20lbs and the last time i went to the doctor my enzymes had dropped a little.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor said the fatty liver will cause the enzymes to be higher so if i continue to loose weight and be at my target weight of 135-140 then that should correct itself.\u00a0\u00a0im still slightly concerned so i do stay away from Advil, motrin, alcohol, etc... because that will raise enzymes but i believe my doctor is right so im going to continue to loose the weight and see if that helps.\u00a0\u00a0Im also getting tested in about 3 months for hepatitis and stuff like that but i 99.999999% believe i dont have that.\u00a0\u00a0are u overweight at all??",

    "question": "My liver enzymes started rising about 1 year ago and has gradually continued to get higher and now are at 99 and 124.\u00a0\u00a0ABout 5 years ago a ultrasound showed a fatty liver but my enzymes have been normal until a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0I see a new nurse practionioner and she said it was probably due to a fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0I have mild diabetes diet controlled for the past 2 years and hypertenions which I take a water pill and tenormin and linispril.\u00a0\u00a0Other that this I have been taking vitamin B12 for the past year or 2.\u00a0\u00a0Would this raised my enzymes?\u00a0\u00a0The nurse practioner said she is not concerned unless they continue to raise and go up to about 300.\u00a0\u00a0I have read at that stage you need a transplant.Is it normal for your liver enzymes to continue to raise if you have a fatty liver?\u00a0\u00a0Is my liver becoming disease?\u00a0\u00a0Since I have a fatty liver due to diet, does the elevated liver enzymes mean nothing and though for the past year they have continued to rise, should I ever be concerned.Pleae advise.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
