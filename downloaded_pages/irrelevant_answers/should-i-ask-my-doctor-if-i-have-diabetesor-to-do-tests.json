            "answer": "Hi xLiLShortie817x,I am a volunteer here and not a physician but from your brief description it does sound like there may be some health issues.I was diagnosed at 14 wih diabetes and some of my syptoms were excessive thirst and urination. In addition I had extreme fatigue. My concerns are with your circulatory issues (neuropothy) which is also a sypmtom of diabetes. My suggestion is that you see your doctor before your scheduled August appointment. If your feet are turning purple there is something serious that should be checked. Feeling faint can be dangerous as well since you do not know where you may be when this may occur. You could be walking down stairs or crossing a street. Please do not wait!!! Let us know how it turns out with your Doctor, if it is diabetes we can help with websites and support groups to get you through a difficult adjustment period.I wish you all the best and hope you feel better soon\u00a0\u00a0CG",

            "answer": "Hi LiLShortie,I am not a doctor but I have been living with diabetes for 11 years. Iwas diagnosed at the age of 18 although I've had symptoms for at least ayear before that.After reading your letter I first have to say that you sound like avery responsible and hard working person. Although I am concerned aboutthe symptoms you say you experience I can't say for a fact that it'sdiabetes. However, I definitely would encourage you to see your doctoras soon as you can and do a blood test to, not only check for diabetes,but also check to see if everything else is OK to rule out any otherconditions.The most common symptoms of Type I diabetes are:weight lossfrequent urinationextreme thirst and hungerfruity odor on the breathextreme fatigueblurry visionI would strongly encourage you to see a doctor sooner than yourappointment in August, if it's possible. If you continue to experiencethese symptoms don't hesitate to go to a walk-in clinic or even anemergency room if you're not feeling well. It may or may not be diabetesbut if you're experiencing all these symptoms, it has to be SOMETHING,and therefore you need to get checked out by a doctor as soon aspossible, instead of suffering and maybe doing more damage to your body.Please see a doctor and let us know how you're doing! If you are infact diabetic you will find help and support on this forum so pleasecome back and tell us how you are.Take care!",

            "answer": "I know it must be frustrating when you're not feeling well and people don't believe there's anything wrong. Just tell your Mom you're not feeling well and whatever it is is affecting your school work and your life in general. Even if it's not diabetes you still need to find out why you're feeling this way. Tell her you just want to get checked out by a doctor to make sure everything is OK. You may also try and speak to the school nurse and see if she can help. Tell her about your concerns and ask if she could speak to your Mom -maybe that could help.Good luck and take care of yourself!",

    "question": "Hey everyone!Let me tell you a little about me so hopefully I can have you understand my situation.I am a 14 year old freshman in high school. I have always been a really good student up until now, when my grades dropped. At first I thought it was just the change of starting highschool or i jus needed to try harder, but it has become worse and more obvious that it is due to a lack of ability to focus and keep my attention on things. Even when I sit down and try my hardest to read and concentrate, it's like my brain is not there. When i am standing for a while or jus a little while my feet tend to swell and ger red and sometimes purple. Also they start to hurt really bad.\u00a0\u00a0I am always tired. At first I thought it was because I wasn't getting enough sleep, but with an adequate amount of sleep I still fall asleep in my classes and other times throughout the day.I am having to urinate a little more than usual and am thirsty more often. I usually don't eat lunch and sometimes i eat breakfast, but i find when i come home from school i eat ALOT.\u00a0\u00a0There are sometimes when I eat so much that i dont have any room left for dinner.Today in school, i had to go home early because i got really dizzy, lightheaded, and stomach pains. i felt like i was going to faint and other friends asked me if i fainted because i looked like i was going to. i really thought i was going to fall to the ground.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering if these were some sort of signs and if i should ask my doctor in August when i go and see her if i should get tested.\u00a0\u00a0thank you for your help! xLiLShortie817x",
