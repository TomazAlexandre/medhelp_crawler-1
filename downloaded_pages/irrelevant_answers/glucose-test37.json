Here we get referred to diet changing classes and check our blood glucose over a 2wk period and then retested. I'm not sure if the test results is a true reflection of what happens? I mean, the level of glucose in lucozade is high and this drink isn't a natural product and contains loads of other artificial stuff. My normal diet also doesn't contain as much sugar or starchy stuff, so I wonder about this test. Hopefully with dietary changes my results will look better.",
