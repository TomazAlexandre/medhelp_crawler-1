            "answer": "When I found out I was super upset for like a day but then I realized it would go away. And you'll learn quickly its not really the sweets that are your issue its carbs. Bread, rice, pasta, juice anything with a lot of carbs turns into sugar into your body.You'll keep a log of meals and check your sugars 4 times a day its not so bad. Within a couple weeks you'll be able to figure out what makes your sugars high and what doesn't. You just need a low carb diet. Your doctor will have you meat with someone to help you with that. Its not so bad I still eat most all foods I love and my sugars are kept low I even eat desert most nights. I mean I can't have a huge piece of cake but 2-3 cookies with some milk or half a chocolate bar is fine for me. You'll do fine and as long as you keep your sugars in check the baby will grow normally and be fine. If you don't keep your sugars in check baby could end up in nicu with a sugar drip.",
