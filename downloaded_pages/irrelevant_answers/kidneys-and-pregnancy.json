            "answer": "Yes, I have a daughter.\u00a0\u00a0I still have both my kidneys, just only the left one works properly.\u00a0\u00a0I was born w/ a double ureter and a malformation of my rt kidney, so it has limited function. I had alot of infections as an infant, and was actually on the OR table to have the kidney removed when my doc decided as a last resort to put me on a medication Gantrisin? I think. Took it for many years. I never really understood the full extent of the damage, but I do know that when I was pregnant my parents had consulted with a renal specialist and had him \"waiting in the wings\" in case there were any complications, but there were none. Definitely consult w/a specialist about it.They will be able to provide you with alot more info.",

    "question": "I was born with a \"bad kidney\" on the left side, which caused me many problems until the doctors discovered and removed it when I was four years old. I have been relatively healthy ever since, and the right kidney is doing just fine. I do take a some minor precautions, and I was told by a doctor that, some day, if I were to become pregnant, that I should be considered a \"high risk pregnancy\". No real reason, he said, just to keep an extra eye on things since everything is in there together.I'm just wondering: with no kidney on the left side and a kidney (so I'm told) 2X the normal size on the right-- has anyone ever heard of issues with carrying a baby when you don't have normal kidneys?",
