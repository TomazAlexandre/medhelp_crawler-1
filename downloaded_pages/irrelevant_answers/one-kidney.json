            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Understand your predicament. Your doctor has recommended kidney removal to prevent the tumor from spreading. People are born with a single kidney and may not be aware of it. It is sometimes detected accidentally. The single kidney usually compensates for the functionality. So, don\u2019t worry. Only take care to keep risk factors like diabetes and hypertension under check and also treat any urinary infections promptly. Please discuss all your doubts with your consulting doctor before consenting for surgery.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
