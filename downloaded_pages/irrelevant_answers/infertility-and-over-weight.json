            "answer": "Hi Meeno! Being overweight can cause problems conceiving...but 63 kgs doesn't sound like that much. I'm not really that familiar with metformin, but did your doctor give it to you just to lose weight, or are you taking it for any medical reasons?",

            "answer": "If they gave you metformin it's probably either for diabetes or for PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with Heather.\u00a0\u00a0While you gained substantial weight for you, being 63 kgs isn't even in the overweight category and probably shouldn't affect your fertility.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you are on metformin for PCOS, that will mess with your hormones and CAN affect your fertility.\u00a0\u00a0 If it is PCOS, you are still very young and very skinny (especially compared to most with pcos), so both of those things are very much in your favor and it shouldn't be too difficult for you.",

            "answer": "Here is a website I found with a list of the tests (it's easier to look at because I'm no doctor).\u00a0\u00a0 There are also links on it (on the right listed in red) as far as symptoms and thoroughly describing what it is.http://www.labtestsonline.org/understanding/conditions/pcos-3.htmlIf you have any questions, please let me know.",
