            "answer": "Yes, celiac disease can cause these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0All you have to do is eat a gluten-free diet (no wheat, barley, rye or oats) and give it about 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0You might get relief within a few days or weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone is different.\u00a0\u00a0You'll have to read up on the diet so you'll know what you can and can't eat.\u00a0\u00a0I can't tell you for sure if this is your problem, but it's definitely worth trying to see if you get relief.\u00a0\u00a0Another possibility is yeast overgrowth in your intestines.\u00a0\u00a0The gluten free diet will help with that but not completely eliminate the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, when you start these kinds of diets, the diarrhea might temporarily continue.\u00a0\u00a0So give it time and see how you feel.\u00a0\u00a0 I hope this helps!",

            "answer": "According to my doctor he said they did test for Celiac disease when they did the colonoscopy and I did not have it. Is there anyone else out there with these same problems? I am at my wits end on what to do. I have tried several medications for diarrhea and it doesn't help. One doctor said it was diabetic enteropathy. What can be done about this? I am a prisoner in my own house. Any help anyone can give would be appreciated greatly.",

            "answer": "I'm questioning the information the doctor gave you.\u00a0\u00a0You don't test for celiac disease with a colonoscopy - the doctor has to do an Endoscopy - from the top.\u00a0\u00a0I really think you should go on an Atkins type diet.\u00a0\u00a0Now I see you are diabetic and on insulin once a day. So you'll have to check with your doctor before starting (if you want to give it a try).\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if your doctor will be open to this diet and playing around with your insulin.\u00a0\u00a0The Atkins type diets help circumvent the whole insulin problem.\u00a0\u00a0It helps the body get past the insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0And what helps the diabetes, will probably end up helping your intestinal problem heal in time.\u00a0\u00a0Something for you to think about.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find an answer to your problem somewhere.\u00a0\u00a0But this is what I would do if it were me.\u00a0\u00a0And again, a doctor must help you with your insulin medication as you do this diet.Good luck!",

            "answer": "yes this is a big symptom of celiac disease, mine showed in an endoscopy. I bet you if you start eating gluten free you will get better. also just because it doesn't show the first time doesn't mean you don't have it, it get worse through time where you won't even hold the food down for more than 10 minutes. I actually never had the diahrrea, it was vomiting and feeling like choking. this condition is very common in diabetics.",
