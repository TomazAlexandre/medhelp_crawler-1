            "answer": "This is a finding that you need to discuss with your doc since he will need to put this together with any other findings. In general a fatty pancreas - depending upon the amount of fatty infiltration - can suggest that dietary changes need to be made. But marked fatty atrophy is often associated with type II diabetes, and in some cases with generalized atherosclerosis, so the findings of a fatty pancreas need to be correlated with other test findings. In a similar manner, heterogenous can mean finding pancreatic tissues in areas 'outside' of the general boundaries of the normal limits, which may or may not be the finding in your case.",
