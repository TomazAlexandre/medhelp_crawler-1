            "answer": "Hi there.The decision regarding the treatment of breast cancer for women more than 70 years old is less clear cut, but if the patient is strong, ambulatory, and does not have any significant co-morbid conditions (like heart diseases, diabetes, stroke, etc), then a mastectomy will be a prudent procedure.\u00a0\u00a0After the surgery, the next question will be on what type of adjuvant treatment can be employed (chemotherapy or hormonal therapy) and some studies would lean more towards a less intense treatment in the form of hormonal therapy (if the cancer is hormone receptor positive).Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Regards.",
