            "answer": "All your symptoms could be related to hypothyroidism. Take your Meds - your TSH should become better and should be under 2. All your symptoms are I am sure hard to deal with.. The weight loss is rare but not uncommon. I suspect some other disease happening in paralel - have you tried seeing a GI specialist? Could it be that you are allergic to wheat for example? The glucosen or cardio issues can be related to thyroid but not that common. I suspect some other disease that is happening in parallel to thyroid. I am curious what the Dr. will be responding to your post. I think test for Antibodies too - see if Hashimotos thyroiditis has anything to do with it... Checking your labwork again sounds like a good idea in a few weeks. I wish you good luck!",

    "question": "I took a test early this year and was told I had a TSH level of 5.7 mIU/1. A follow-up test showed it had gone up to 6.5 three months later, and now, another three months later, I was told the level is 23(!). All this time, though, my T3/T4 levels have been relatively normal. I've lost weight, I've become increasingly nervous, irritable and forgetful, and I rarely seem to ever get a good night's sleep. I've also developed a decrease in my ability to process sugar without full-blown diabetes symptoms. It seems that even when I feel as though I've slept enough, once I eat I often fall back into a haze, though this varies with the food. Often when I eat something I develop a speckled red patch just below my sternum, sometimes accompanied by pruritis. There are ancillary issues, including frequent intestinal distress, flaking skin, and increased ringing in the ears, but I don't know if these are related. I'm in my early 30's, I have many relatives who were disposed to type 2 diabetes, but none who had hypothyroidism as far as I know, although I suspect my late father may have had it.We will do glucose and thyroid blood tests in a few months, and I have been given a daily prescription for 50 micrograms of thyroxin, but should I be doing more? Shouldn't we test for tumors in the thyroid and pituitary given the desparity between the TSH levels and the T3/T4 levels? Could the glucose intolerance be related? Thank you very much for your time.",
