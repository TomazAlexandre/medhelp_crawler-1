            "answer": "Most doctors list normal blood sugars BEFORE meals as being in a range of between about 70-126. And I believe that doctors tend to say a person is perhaps diabetic if the after-meal sugars go above about 150 (I have read that the number is 146, but different doctors use slightly different variations on these numbers). In any case, the exact number is not the issue -- if ALL of her sugars are running higher than the \"normal\" range by quite a lot, she should definitely be checked out. I personally would be concerned if my child showed sugars above 200 fairly often. Her sleepiness is a possible symptom, and if this has been going on for a long time, some damages may be happening. She should be seen ASAP. And her dad should not hesitate to take her to the emergency room if she seems unresponsive or if she gets nauseated and starts throwing up. I hope she turns out to be very healthy.",

            "answer": "I want to say thank you for allowing people to read these post. I have been searching for information about diabetes for 2 days and haven't gotten to much help until reading these post. My son is 9 and always tests really high. I didn't think anything of it everyone in my family didn't get diabetes until 30 and up. I bought a monitor for myself and most of the time only used it on my son. On New Years Eve his sugar was 324! I was in shocked I called my dad and he said get him tested asap. I go in the afternoon to try and BEG the pediatrician who over the phone already said he would NOT test because my sons file doesn't indicate a need. Anyway I am pretty sure my son will be tested if not I will have a new doctor and the A1C done as my dad suggested by next week. I had no idea how many children and tiny babies are born with diabetes, I was extremely ignorant to this until just before midnight on dec 31st 2006.\u00a0\u00a0I am hoping it was just a mistake the reading. I dont want to get all worked up yet, but the stomachaches worries me,my sons biggest complaint is headaches ALL the time but i didn't see any post on that...Anyway thanks and tjanks for all the great questions, some are exactly what I was thinking. I guess I'll check back and let everyong know if he tests ok or not. Either way i do plan to educate myself more on this subject.",

            "answer": "Well, after reading this post, I felt better. I too had a scary situation happen to me just before Christmas. My 5 year old daughter, who has not had any urine accidents in the day time sinc she was potty-trained at 3 yr old, had wet the bed for about a week and had 2 urine accidents in the daytime. I noticed she was eating more and drinking more than usual. I thought maybe she had a bladder infection (which she has never had before). Well, to my suprise, when I spoke to my mother-in-law she said that she had also noticed those symptoms and that maybe we should test her blood sugar. I brought my daughter to the place where my mother-in-law works, and much to my suprise her blood sugar was 217 (after drinking 2 glasses of water). Both my mother-in-law and I were shocked. This was 2 days before Christmas. Well, to make a long story short, I went out and bought a meter, testing her twice day, and counting her carbohydrates. We have been to our family doctor twice and now seeing a pediatric endocrinologist. Her blood testing has been inconclusive (Fasting BS = 92, C-Peptide = 1.0, HgbA1c = 5.5). When we saw the ped endo, he thought because of her age and irratic blood sugars that she probably has Type 1 diabetes.Don't feel bad, you are not the only one waiting in the winds to see what will happen. I will tell you what several people have told me: If a parent has a gut feeling about something, follow it because 9 time out of 10 that feeling is right.",
