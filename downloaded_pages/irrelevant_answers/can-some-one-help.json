            "answer": "If the blood sugar is normal, it is likely that your pancreas may be working fine. An ultrasound, even though it can have a poor prognosis, will show most parts of the pancreas.If this is ruled out, these are the possible causes of stomach cramping:-\u2022 Irritable Bowel Syndrome\u2022 Inflammatory Bowel Disease\u2022 Crohn's disease\u2022 Lactose intolerance\u2022 Celiac disease\u2022 Gastritis\u2022 Peptic ulcerThe gastroenterologists usually provide an endoscopy to rule out any serious conditions. If a duodenum ulcer is found, it is most likely to be benign. Gastric ulcers have both benign and malignant problems, but stomach cancer in children is rare.Your daughter will be fine. Has she been through a lot of stress? This can cause temporary gastrointestinal disorders. I have abdominal pain and waiting for the gastroscopy test. Hope everything goes well, and nothing is serious. If it is IBS, then having a limited diet plan will help manage it.",
