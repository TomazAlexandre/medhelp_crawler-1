            "answer": "On this forum, we have heard from a number of moms whose kids have shown signs of hypoglycemia, and I offer my sympathy, for it is a frustrating problem and frightening to watch your child have these episodes. It sounds to me like you are doing exactly the right things... just keep an eye out on him, for you will notice the changes in behavior maybe even before he notices that he feels bad. Sleepiness, a sudden feeling of chills OR a sudden hot feeling both can be symptoms, yawning for no reason (I tbink the brain seeks help and if it can't get sugars, sends for oxygen), irritable moods, etc. -- these are all classic symptoms of hypoglycemia. After his lab tests come back, you may want to visit www.hypoglycemia.org, a website devoted to this condition.",

    "question": "I'm worried that my almost 3 year old may have hypoglycemia. Today at the beach he had plenty of snacks and fluids and was playing with other rowdy boys his age. I could tell he was getting a little sloppy and falling down more. So I grabbed him and made him take a break. He started to shake, claimed he was cold (normally he's always hot), slurred his speach, wanted to go to sleep, got pale and weak and very lethargic. I instantly started to force the fluids and gave him some snacks. After 20 or so minutes he started to come around. But it really scared me. I started to think about other signs that could be related to a blood sugar level. He sweats a lot ... even when it's not very warm out, he is often drenched at night when the A/C is on, and he burns through snacks and beverages faster then the average child. And he's not hyper or anything like that ... quite the opposite actually. He's very mellow. I'm going to have blood work done on him this week. And from what his doctor says it could be his motabolism is fast, or if he is hypoglycemic then offering snacks and beverages more often is really the only way to treat him. And that's what I am doing.My question is: What kinds of snacks/beverages are best and do I offer them in a particular order? Do I stay away from certain types of foods?Anyone who has any information or experience with this subject i would greatly appreciate any of your advice.",
