    "question": "My right eye keeps turning red for more than a month now. I have seen an ophtamologist about it, had many tests done, including blood tests (not within range- fibrinogen 600, ESR 45, ASLO 273 ) and I have taken\u00a0\u00a0 antibiotics for14 days (an infectious disease doctor prescribed them to me). The redness goes away for several days, only to return one morning ( like today) without any apparent cause. I am really frightened that something serious may be an underlying cause. Can you help me?",
