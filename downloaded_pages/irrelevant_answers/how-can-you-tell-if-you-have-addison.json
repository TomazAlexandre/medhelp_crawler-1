            "answer": "Addison's can be hard to figure out simply because it's a hormone type of disease. Symptoms of hormones that are \"out of wack\" are vague when they begin and sometimes takes awhile to track down what exactly is going on. You don't need to develop a tan to have it, but the \"tan\" usually comes when it's in the more advanced stage. Cortisol and ACTH are two of the most common tests they begin with when they suspect Addisons. But, there are other blood tests they do that also give clues if you have this.Diarrhea, nausea, loss of appetite, mood swings, Is your blood pressure low at certain parts of the day?\u00a0\u00a0 These are some of the symptoms you can develop as it progresses.I hope that helps a bit.",

    "question": "I was wondering if you have a routin blood work done will it let you know if you have addison, and if you have been fatigue for like 2 years and you are still able to work does that mean you don't have addison, I am 43, been a type 1 diabetic most my life I also have low thyroid, on med for that. I am always so tiered I have hardly any energy I have to force myself to go to work. My leg muscle seem weak I can't seem to walk as much they seem to want to give out. I am 5'2\" about 113 pounds I have not lost any weight I do not have tan skin. I do all of a sudden use salt on my food, but I don't crave it so bad that I am eatting pickles. Could it be I am just getting old. Hard to go to the Dr as I have no insuracne. If anyone could let me know what they think Thank you",
