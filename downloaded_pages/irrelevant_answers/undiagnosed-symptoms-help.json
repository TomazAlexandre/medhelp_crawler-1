            "answer": "The hair loss can be stress related, as far as the itching, well, you would need a prescription for Hydroxyl CL which can suppress the itching or possibly try some oatmeal bath or benadryl to suppress the itching. The leg pain could be growing pains, RLS, or variety of other things, I'd recommend going to your primary health care physician for diagnosis.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Iron deficiency is the commonest cause of hair loss. Iron deficiency can be due to poor intake or poor absorption or due to hidden loss from bleeding as is seen in UTI and gut problems like IBS. The cause of anemia has to be found out by various blood tests. Iron replacement along with diet rich in iron and hemoglobin should be given.Hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, oils, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause. Since you also have itch possibility of fungal infection, dermatitis, stress and anxiety along with thyroid disorders are maximum. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps. Take care!",
