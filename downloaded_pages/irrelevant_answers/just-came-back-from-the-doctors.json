            "answer": "Well I had nothing and was fine all yesterday. I've had stomach and some lower back pain but most of it has been IBS related with gurgling and went away with food. Last night I'd get random...every 20 minutes 2 second sharp pain in the urethra region of my privates. No urge to urinate, just the pain. Then before bed I freaked and really didn't feel I was emptying my bladder but no burning. I went to bed and the urethra pain disappeared for good. But this morning the urine was there, just a little weaker and a little sting. Really not alot of problems besides that. Some middle back dull pian that isn't constant and barely there.",

            "answer": "I am glad everrything is good! Yes it was anxiety, but we all do it! We think we def have something wrong with us, and it could not be anxiety, but it usually is. I know I have been guilty of that- a few times!!!The main thing is, you know you sugar is good so you dont have to worry about diabetes. Hey, I do have a question- since you found out you are ok- are you still peeing as much? I will do that, once I find out there is nothing really wrong with my, that symptoms just seems to disappear. Anxiety is amazing!!",
