            "answer": "there are new markers to detect early hcc, Golgi protein 73 is the best marker, alfafeto protein is not good anymore but guidelines still use it, in case of hcc early detection and resection has good rates.this is a research level so i don't think it is easy to find a lab for these markers, in italy there is so much research that i found many places but i don't know about the rest of the worldhttp://www.aacc.org/members/nacb/LMPG/OnlineGuide/PublishedGuidelines/LiverTumorMarkerLMPG/Documents/LiverTumorMarkersCh2.pdfif it doesn't grow, iperecoic and according to position it is usually a emoangioma, a benign tumor found on skin and liver with no danger at all and which doesn't turn to hcc, if it grows doubling in about 6 months it can be hcc.MRI is also very good at early detectionunfortunately all hbsag positive are at risk of hcc and even after hbsag seroconversion there is still risk for a couple of years after seroconversion although lowest risk.there is only another illness which has much higer rates for hcc than hbv which is diabetes.the best way to prevent hcc are melatonin 20mg x day and selenium 200mcg x day bllod level between 130-150, vitamin D between 50-60ng/ml, hbvdna und, hbsag/cccdna low or negative",
