            "answer": "Lyrica isn't made for muscle spasms, but for muscle soreness and neuropathy involved in FMS.Your thyroid could very well be causing some of the problems you describe...so could the diabetes and anemia.\u00a0\u00a0Until you get a clean bill of health (straightening out the thyroid, diabetes and anemia) you should only do low impact exercises (stretching or water aerobics is good).If you have not had an MRI done, that may be something to consider to rule out other illnesses that can mimic FMS.\u00a0\u00a0Also, testing for Lyme Disease.Hopefully, by getting your thyroid and other issues under control you will begin to feel much better in the months ahead.\u00a0\u00a0I pray this is the case for you.",
