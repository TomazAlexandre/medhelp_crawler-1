    "question": "I have recently been diagnosed with Osteoarthritis, but have been suffering with a pain in the upper part of the inside & back of my legs, (not lower part of legs) it can only be described as cold & painful to the touch, or rather I cannot bear to touch it or for anything to touch the area because it feels icy/freezing. The easiest way to describe it is if you put your hand on the ice in your chest freezer for a while it becomes painful to the touch.\u00a0\u00a0It can last for several days & is reccuring more regular than it used to.\u00a0\u00a0I do not want to trouble my doctor if there is no reason to because I have had to take up a lot of his time with the arthritis & asthma etc.\u00a0\u00a0I look forward to hearing from you on any ideas on what this could be.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you mcbeth1",
