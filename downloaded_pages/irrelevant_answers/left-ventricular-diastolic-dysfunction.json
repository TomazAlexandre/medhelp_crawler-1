            "answer": "Diastolic dysfunction means that the left ventricle does not relax enough on the diastolic portion, or refilling of the left ventricle, of each beat. This is a fairly common finding and is usually found during an echo which can measure the size of the chambers and walls of the heart. Have you had an echo and if so what did that report show? This could be the result of hypertension so you should have that checked as well.Other than that, a pretty good report, congrats!Jon",

            "answer": "Why did you need to have a heart catherization? Did you have cardiac symptoms and as Jon asked, did you have a cardiac echo done prior to the cath/angiogram? Your age and sex would be helpful also. Diva is known to me and has multiple issues especially cardiac ones and requires all those meds she mentions. Your signs may be different, and not one single cardiac test will determine the whole picture. And if you don't understand a doctor's evaluation, then go back and ask again. Doctors may appear rushed but it does no good to follow a doctor's advice if you don't understand the advice. A second opinion is always good. It's your health!\u00a0\u00a0Joan.",

            "answer": "I have been told that I have left side diastolic dysfunction. Also been told that I have all of the systems of diabetes without having diabetes. Could there be a relationship here. And what is ideopathic dysfunction.Since I have passed through the Dr. telling me I would be dead in 3 years, I am now checking up on what they actually found. I have also been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy in my feet. Drs. last notes were that my breathlessness and other symptoms were psychological and high stress related. I'm ok with that, just wanting to make sure I don't miss anything. Demi",

            "answer": "Really depends on your doctor, your report doesn't show anything bad, really a pretty good report and almost identical to mine. I was told to repeat in 5 - 7 years or if you develop any heart related symptoms. Your doctor may want to recheck in a year or two just to make sure there is no change in the regurgitation of the mitral valve.Great report, congrats!Jon",
