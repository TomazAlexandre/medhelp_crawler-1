            "answer": "Hello.I'm not exactly the mot experienced person you could talk to but I know what you mean.Sometimes when I'm with my boyfriend (please bare in mind that I am legal to have sex, thanks) I just want to have sex straight away, or at random points of the day I'll just be low woah wtf.I think diabetese has a different effect on people. Maybe its not anything to do with diabetese, maybe we just enjoy the feeling of having someone to hold and more. :')",

            "answer": "Hi there, that is wierd. I also have a really high sex drive and am insulin dependent, but I'm a 21 female. I have never thought that insulin could increase your sex drive but there is a relationship between working out and your sex drive. Both release endorphins and both feel great, especially if you are in shape and you do it regularly. Plus, your a guy and men in general have a high sex drive. But it definately could be due to testosterone levels. If you exercise daily, you probably have higher testosterone levels which in return could increase your sex drive. Don't take my word on everything...I am studying physical education and health education and we do actually talk alot about these kinds of things. But I would definately see a doctor if you are unsure about things.Hope this helps!!",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with type1 diabetes at the age of 5 months. I am the 1st in family history to ever have it. My mother suffered a severe electric shock from a cash register when she was 6 months into her pregnancy. Some believe that was the cause , but alas there is no real proof.\u00a0\u00a0I have been insulin dependant since i was 5 months old. I am now over 40. Ever since I can remember I have had an unusually very high sex drive to the point where it drives my wife of nearly 20 years nuts. Is this some sort of possible side affect to the unsulin intake for 40 years or is it just me ?? My diabetes is very well controlled and I have no problems relating to it. I get tested every 3 months by my doctor for control. I play sport all year round and I am fairly fit. Even after running around a cricket field for 6 hours I still want to have sex with my wife as soon as I get home. I also masterbate daily without thought.\u00a0\u00a0HELP ??",
