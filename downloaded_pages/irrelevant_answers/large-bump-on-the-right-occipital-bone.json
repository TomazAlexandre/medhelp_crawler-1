            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!A bump on the right occipital bone can be due to several causes like lipoma (localized collection of fat), a swollen lymph node, (localized harmless swelling in a nerve), an abscess, or folliculitis (hair follicle infection). Rarely is it a bony tumor like osteoma.What is important is that even if the bump may be harmless in itself, it is causing pressure symptoms.The numbness could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level. Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness of little and ring finger.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor (neurologist). It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
