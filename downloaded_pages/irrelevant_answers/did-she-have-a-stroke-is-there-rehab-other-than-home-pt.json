            "answer": "Yes it sounds like she had a stroke, but I agree with the previous post that she needs to be further evaluated.\u00a0\u00a0If she has no paralysis, you are luckey.\u00a0\u00a0 Physical therapy, occupational therapy and speech therapy did not help my 87 year old mother at all...she is right side paralyzed and cannot speak at all.\u00a0\u00a0We have her at home with caregivers.\u00a0\u00a0Our choices were nursing home or home with care.\u00a0\u00a0Don't try to do it on your own..it is to difficult/stressful..you will end up the one in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.

            "answer": "A lot of her symptoms could be from her diabetes also, or her medications, or a possible urinary tract infection, or the beginning of Alzheimers.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr's need to check further to find out what is really going on...not just assume it's a stroke,even though the symptoms are similar.\u00a0\u00a0Often Dr's can't tell the difference between a stroke and Alzheimers..sometimes the two coexist.",

    "question": "my 84 yr old mother in law seems to have suffered a stroke albeit a mild one. her doctor said she has and has ordered home pt, ot and speech. she cant complete a thought or sentence, she slurs. the dr ran a mri and carotid dopler, both are unremarkable. she sometimes gets very delusional and the dr says it may be sugar (she's a diabetic) or infection. when she went to er at the beginning they ran a cat scan and sent her home. is there a way or place to get her thoroughly evaluated? she cant live alone anymore and we dont want to send her to a nursing home. the speech therapist says he cant help but clearly she has problems. she cant remember how to use the phone, cant remember conversations for more than an hour. we just dont know what to do. the o/t people just seem useless and confuse her even more",
