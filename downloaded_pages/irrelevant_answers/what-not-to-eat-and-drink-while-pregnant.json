            "answer": "No raw fish or meat. Your steak should at least be medium well. And stay away from big fish like tuna or sword fish due to the mercury level. Canned tuna is ok. Most seafood once a week is fine. Limited amount of coffee and tea is ok too. Spicy food as long as it sit well in your stomach. Otherwise it's business as usually but too much of anything could cause an issue in your stomach of course. Also take prenatal vitamin if you can.",
