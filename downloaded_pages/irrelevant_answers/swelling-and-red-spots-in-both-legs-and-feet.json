    "question": "Hi, I am having a specific issue in my leg. My feet from around ankle to toes started swelling about 8-9 weeks back and quite painful in the area just before toes. Then some 5-6 weeks back some red spots started appearing around my ankle till calf and this are slightly hard and painful spots (around 15-20 in each leg). I have consulted a doc but he is not able to diagnose anything. In last two - three weeks the pain has increased with swelling actually worsening by the evening though slightly better in the morning. New red spots are also appearing and now in the calf region as well. Am a bit worried what is this and what is the cure...",
