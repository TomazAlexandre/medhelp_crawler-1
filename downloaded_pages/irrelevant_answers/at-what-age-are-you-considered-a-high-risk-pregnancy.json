            "answer": "Thanks perty- My best friend had her daughter 4 years ago and she was 38, had no problems, gave birth at home, and had a VERY healthy 10 lb'er baby girl. She was completely healthy otherwise, and had had another little girl 2 years before. They considered her high risk due to her age, to her dismay. She is very active and healthy and doesn't act her age...she has more energy than me in my twenties!I was wondering because my mom mentioned my cousin's pregnancy to me, and we were having a conversation about what age was high risk. I thought it was 35, my mom thought 40. Just thought I would ask to clear it up...thats all.",

Can't really make our eggs more youthful, healthier and better looking by exercising, eating wheatgrass or slathering expensive cream like we could with the rest of our body...",
