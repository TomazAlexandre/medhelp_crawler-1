            "answer": "Just wanted to provide you a bit of info and bump this back up to the top so that it will not get overlooked.I'm surprised that you feel that the Synthroid caused your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I would have bet that with those thyroid test results you would have had hypo symptoms all along.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently you have an autoimmune system problem (Hashimoto's Thyroiditis).\u00a0\u00a0Over a relatively long period this causes destruction of the thyroid glands.\u00a0\u00a0So you will have to be on thyroid meds to compensate.\u00a0\u00a0If Synthroid causes a problem, there are other brands that may not.\u00a0\u00a0The difference is usually the filler material used in compounding the meds.For your appointment I think you need to ask if the Endo is willing to test and adjust the actual, biologically active\u00a0\u00a0thyroid hormones, free T3 and free T4, with whatever type of medication is necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms relief should be all important, not TSH level. You should also ask if he is willing to prescribe meds other than T4 types.\u00a0\u00a0If the answer to either is no, then longer term I think you will need to find a good thyroid doctor that will treat your symptoms, by testing and adjusting FT3 and FT4 (not total T3 and total T4).",

            "answer": "What you are experiencing sounds just like hypothyroid symptoms and not the medicine.\u00a0\u00a0Give the medicine a chance to work and one week is not enough time.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, it takes 6-8 wks to build up in your system and at that time, you should have your bloodwork re-done with the FT3 and Ft4 tested as well as TSH.\u00a0\u00a0Even at that time, you still may not be on enough medicine and it may have to be increased again.\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors increase the medicine quite slowly.My personal experience is that I felt worse for several weeks after starting levothyroxine but my doctor said to give it the full 8 weeks and to be patient.\u00a0\u00a0(not my strong suit).\u00a0\u00a0I am on my second 8 weeks and fully expect another increase in a couple of weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Overall though, I feel much better.While you think you have had minimal symptoms, probably wont' realize how bad you felt until you feel better.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck at the doctor.",

            "answer": "Yes, my isthmus (center strip joining the two thyroid lobes) was over 2X the normal size on my last ultrasound. That's what what sometimes chokes me, but it's not as bad now that I quit eating gluten. I still have issues with large vitamins.My last endo never told me about my isthmus when she had her technician run the ultrasound. My new, and more experienced endo, actually did the ultrasound himself and explained everything about the ultrasound.Having an enlarged isthmus is common among Hashi patients, and it will commonly cause a choking sensation. I thought it was cancer at first, too, as do many of us. It's typical for us to panic, especially when we have nodules that leak thyroid hormone. That extra hormone may cause even more anxiety, stress, heart palps, etc...:) Tamra",
