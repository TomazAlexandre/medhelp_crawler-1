Not her problem.Most medical schools provide indigent medical care, the University of Neveda School of Medicine is located in Reno.Most municipalities also provide for indigent medical care. Call the social service department of the state of Nevada or call a local hospital and ask for social service. They can review your options.Most states provide a Medicaid type of program for indigents, they should also be able to give you a list of physicians that accept medicaid.Frankly from what you've posted it's not likely that traveling anywhere would affect the outcome of her eye over what can be arranged locally.

            "answer": "Your case is so close to mine its scary. My mom knew she had diabetes but never went to the doctors until her eye became like this. She used to take pills before meals to help her diabetes but just stopped. Then she woke up and her eye was like this and went to the doctors for a full check up. Her Blood Sugar Level was at like 385, and she was borderline stroke, heart attack, liver and kidney failure and many other things, ever since then shes been taking insulin and P-r-icking- her fingers, I've also been filling the syringes because she cant see them, since then her Blood Sugar has gone down to about 100 and we've been eating healthy. The same day i made this topic, i went down to the store and bought a pirate costume eye patch and forced her to wear it, ever since then she has described the pain as a \"2\" compared to a\u00a0\u00a0\"9\" before the patch. Sometimes I just wish my mom would listen to me instead of not taking any action and just dealing with the pain. Thanks for all of your help acme, and now only if I could get my mom to read this so she would know how other people have had the same problems with positive results, but like I said, she is too stubborn and just doesn't want to hear it.",

    "question": "NOTE: My mom is the one with the problem so I wont really know anything else about it then what i am posting here.My mom recently had problems with her left eye, she had sever diabetes and her eye had like a stroke and lose some vision. She went in to have it corrected and they noticed she has large blood vessels behind her eye and they tried to give her a new treatment where they place a shot in her eye, i believe it was some kind of chemotherapy? Well, she had the shot about 3 times and it was not working, her eye was fine, but she was blind, she had no pain. Since then, we have lost our insurance so we can no longer bring her in to continue the shots to correct the blood vessels, since then her eye has become a different color then her good one, like the white part looks slightly gray and her pupil is severely dilated. Her eye is in so much pain that now all she does is sleep, she cant even do the dishes because is hurts so much. We cant really do anything about it because we have no insurance and the treatment would cost thousands of dollars of which we don't have.She is currently taking 2 eye drops twice daily: Cosopt and Prednisolone AC 1% OPHTC SUSP 10ML (a steroid to remove pain)They help the pain and they were both prescribed by the doctor while we had the insurance. Recently her eye has become such a problem it is affecting the family and we really need some help/answers.So my questions are:1) Is there anything we can do to ease the pain other than taking asprin?2) Is there anything we can do to help remove/shrink the blood vessels?3) If nothing will help and we must seek professional treatment, what can they do for her and how much will it roughly cost. (we live in Las Vegas, NV if that helps.)I recently saw online that that taking Vitamin C, Vitamin E, Zinc, and Carotene will help. Is this true?I would like to personally thank you for taking the time to read this and ANYTHING that you think might help would be a great help to us, so please do not be afraid to post what you think.",
