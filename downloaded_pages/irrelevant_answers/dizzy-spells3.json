            "answer": "thanks guys...i'll call the doc on monday...i just never thought it could be my blood pressure because i was just in on thursday and my blood pressure has been normal at every appointment. i am anemic though...maybe that has something to do with it. i am taking the extra iron supplements though so i would think that could be under control. i keep forgetting to mention it at the doctors because it doesnt happen all the time. she is checking my thyroid next appointment because of how ridiculously tired ive been...does being dizzy also corrilate with a thyroid problem?",

            "answer": "gestational diabetes you do not have to be overweight to get, and it really isn't 100% connected to genetics (although if your mother or another close female relative got it while pregnant it can predispose you to the condition, or so it's thought)....it's just one of those things that can occur while pregnant. Did you gain weight fast during this pregnancy? it doesn't have to be a lot, it's more about length of time of weight gain from what I hear....even a few lbs in a very short amount of time....i really hope it turns out to be a blood volume issue (simply your body having trouble adjusting to the 2nd trimester blood volume) and nothing else...keep us posted!",

I never got it, but with last pregnancy (and apparently this one) weight gain is a struggle for me too.",

    "question": "im 24 weeks and some days i wake up SO dizzy that i cant even walk...and just laying down my head spins..closing my eyes makes it even worse so i just have to lie here and suffer through it...and it honestly lasts for hours! ive tried drinking and eating and nothing helps to make it go away. it doesnt happen everyday just sometimes and its always when i wake up from sleeping at night. i dont get it? and its really no fun at all i wish i knew how to make it stop when it happens. i almost fell down on the way to the bathroom a minute ago and i woke up at 9 am and its now 10:30 so its been going strong for a half hour. this is the third morning ive had like this (not in a row). Does this happen to anyone else? should i be conserned or is it just a lovely pregnancy thing? i know u can get more dizzy and faint more often but this dizzy? for this long? all ive read is that sometimes u should sit on the edge of the bed for a few minutes before getting up...but ive sat up in bed for hours and still had it hanging on.any suggestions would be much appreciated",
