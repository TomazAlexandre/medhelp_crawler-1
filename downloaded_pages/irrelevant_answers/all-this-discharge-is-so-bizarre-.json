            "answer": "Your boobs are going to get huge and when the baby comes they will get so sore because they are full of milk but after awhile of breastfeeding your boobs get use to it and so do you. Also, make sure to take good care of your teeth, along with gestational diabetes there is also gestational gingivitis. You may get swollen feet and hands and your feet may grow and whole size (my cousins did). It's a roller coaster but so worth it. And not everyone is the same.",
