            "answer": "Hi, I\u00a0\u00a0too, went around 10 years with simular symptoms. I went to the doctors monthly, but nothing. After awhile I just figured this was my normal. I spent a lot of time in bed as I was so tired all the time. My body temp was up and down. Sometimes I would even sweat sooo much I would have to change my clothes as they were soaked. Anyways, about a year ago I was finally diagnosed with diabetes. I was like WHAT. I was shocked as I had been going to the doctor for such a long time and why did they not find it before. Diabetes is sooo common and extremely easy to diagnose. At the same time I was so extremely happy as this wasn't my normal and I could do a lot to get better. Thats just part of my story, so if they haven't checked you for diabetes it is a very easy blood test, I would recommend it.good luck josse722",
