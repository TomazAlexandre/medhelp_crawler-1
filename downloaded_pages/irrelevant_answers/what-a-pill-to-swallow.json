            "answer": "Are you taking Colestipol or Vytorin to lower your cholesterol?Cholesterol might be actually very beneficial!The cholesterol myth that we have been told, sounds like a 40 year oldbroken record.I haven't seen any studies that prove that lowering cholesterol, improves health status.\u201cIt's not what you don't know that kills you, it's what you know for sure that ain't true.\u201d by Mark TwainI have looked at a lot of studies!!Here's an abstract from PMID: 16875805\u00a0\u00a0Titled:\"Cholesterol Lowering and Mortality: Time for a new Paradigm?\"Sudden cardiac death is the main cause of cardiac mortality. Is blood cholesterol a determinant of sudden cardiac death? Does cholesterol lowering result in fewer sudden cardiac deaths? Answering these two questions may shed new light on the epidemiology of coronary heart disease and on prevention options. In fact, careful analysis of the available data, including randomized trials, indicates that, contrary to a widespread opinion, cholesterol lowering does not appear to be a very effective way of reducing cardiac and overall mortality in the general population.Love & LightNiko",

            "answer": "Vytorin is a combination Ezetimibe and simvastatin and I'm currently taking simvastatin. My doctor is switching my medicine due to my leg cramps to see if that will help. All of the cholesterol \"statin\" medicines can cause muscle cramps.This one works in the gut to keep your body from getting the cholesterol into your body in the first place. Since it works in the gut is why you can't cut, chew or crush it as it has to withstand your digestive juices for a while in order to do its work.Dennis",

            "answer": "Hey Niko,That abstract from 2006 and then subsequent article in 2008 are truly mind blowing to me from the perspective that limiting the amount of saturated fat intake by the patient appears not to have a relationship with the future development of coronary heart disease. I wonder if it extends to stroke and diabetes too?How amazing would it be if the answer to high cholesterol was not drugs but more burgers and fries. I dunno what to think about it all.BlessingsAlex",

            "answer": "Alex, the real culprits are inflammation (from oxidative processes) and high levels of small particle low dense lipoprotein (LDL) that comes from carbohydrates, defined in research as pattern B when at the same time large particle LDL and HDL levels are low. Pattern B is associated with greatly increased risk of heart disease.Pattern A is low small particle LDL, high large particle LDL and high HDL.Cholesterol follows inflammation, helping plug the damage, so it's not the cause, it's not a factor but just a marker in CHD!And since this is the MS Community it might be of some benefit to the members here to look at the following study:High cholesterol, is vital for Myelin repair:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15793579I'm asking for some latitude to allow this link and if it does not appear please search under: PMID: 15793579Burgers are OK, buns are not ( bleached white flour), fries are not ( fried inmostly g.m. pro- inflammatory seed and vegetable oils).In regards to diabetes the main food groups that trigger diabetes through increased toxicity and consequently inflammatory processes are:a. Grains and specially refined flour.b. Sugar and specially fructose.c. Seed and vegetable oils.Very significant as they cause inflammation, insulin resistance and thyroid hormone resistance, all linked to diabetes and if this is not enough, fructose is a big contributor (multiple times greater than glucose) to advanced glycation end products (AGES)and could easily lead to increased Tumor Necrosis Factor Alpha ( TNFa )implicated in many serious inflammatory diseases including Stroke, Psoriasis, Arthritis, Alzheimers, Atherosclerosis, Parkinson's and more!Love & LightNiko",

    "question": "I just was on-line to check out my new RX for cholesterol. \"COLESTIPOL HCL 1GM TAB\".No that isn't a typo. it is 1 gram in size. I currently take some medications that are 500mg per pill and can barely swallow them so I can't imagine what these will be like. And I'm suppose to take two of them before dinner. Of course they also say to not chew, cut or crush them.Dennis",
