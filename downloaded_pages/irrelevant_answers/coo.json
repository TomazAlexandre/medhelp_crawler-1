            "answer": "Exercise, especially in hot weather causes your veins to be more prominent as your body is increasing blood flow to the skin for cooling. Your post did not included what you were doing \"from time to time\" making it difficult to ***** your problem.

I suggest you see a doctor for a complete health checkup and ask to include testing for diabetes. Good luck",
