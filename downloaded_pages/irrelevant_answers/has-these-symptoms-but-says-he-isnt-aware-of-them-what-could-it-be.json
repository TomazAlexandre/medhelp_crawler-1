    "question": "My boyfriend has been going through spells of disorientation, memory loss, sweats, blank stare, slurring of words, higher blood pressure than normal, tunnel vision-running into corners he turns, gas, and pain in stomach for the past week and a half. He isnt aware of any of this happening but can tell something is wrong because i always ask him if he is feeling okay and i make sure he is aware that i see these things happening. A few days before the spells started, he had a crust like layer on the shaft of his penis but it went away after a day or 2.He went to the ER about a week ago and they took a ct scan.It apparently came out fine.He has a docs appt july 3rd but i was wondering if anyone knew what this could possibly be?",
