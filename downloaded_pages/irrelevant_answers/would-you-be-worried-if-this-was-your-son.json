            "answer": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Even health kids and adults get temporary spikes in blood sugars, so 165 is very likely a normal number, particularly with the number of carbohydrates in the meal he ate.\u00a0\u00a0I think he's fine, I wouldn't be concerned, but it's always prudent to check blood sugars if you have concerns.",

            "answer": "The 165 post-meal suggests that he has insulin and it's working.\u00a0\u00a0I would follow the Doctor's advice and test periodically, but I wouldn't worry about that number at this time.\u00a0\u00a0A blood sugar (BG) of 165 fasting would concern me but not 2.5 hours post a high-carb meal.The bedwetting is a different story.\u00a0\u00a0Did you test his BG after those incidents?\u00a0\u00a0I took my then 6 year old in because she wet the bed twice (many years after being potty trained) and she was diagnosed with a non-fasting blood sugar of 283.\u00a0\u00a0Is he extremely thirsty?\u00a0\u00a0Lethargic?\u00a0\u00a0Constantly running to the bathroom?\u00a0\u00a0Those are some additional signs to watch for.For now, I suggest testing here and there and keeping a keen eye on him.",

            "answer": "As a Type1 I can tell you, after eating a burger my bg would be well in to the 300-400 range. 165 is high, however it is not Type1 high, YET! Monitor him like your Dr. suggested, but dont worry your self sick.:)",

    "question": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0My niece was diagnosed 4 years ago at age 5 with Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0My son is 4.5 years old and recently had several accidents in the bed (about 8 over a 3 week period) when he had been dry for about a year.\u00a0\u00a0I bought a meter as we were out of town and could not get to a doctor (I immediately thought about my niece as the night wetting is what sent her to the doctor where she got the diagnoses that day as my nieces urine sugar level was over 1000).My son's last two fasting readings in the morning on a whole blood glucose test meter were 111 and 112.\u00a0\u00a0He was 126 before dinner tonight (1/2 burger, some tator tots & fries).\u00a0\u00a02.5 hours later he was 165.\u00a0\u00a0His pedi just wants us to watch him and maybe look into doing some testing.\u00a0\u00a0What do you guys think?Just a concerned Mom.",
