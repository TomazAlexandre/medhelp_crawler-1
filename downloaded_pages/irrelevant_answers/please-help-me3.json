    "question": "For over a year now I have had the same symptoms and my doctors don't seem to have a diagnosis for me. It starts with my thighs tingling and I feel weak (the same feeling you get if you go the entire day without eating) when this happens it is hard to concentrate and my body seems to be telling me I need to sit down and for the past 9 months I have been having urinary problems. Nothing helps it, eating and drinking more have not helped, sitting or standing makes no difference.I have had an MRI done to check for MS, that came back fine, checked for diabetes, thyroid, anemic, all came back fine. As for my bladder it started with an infection but the feeling hasn't gone away yet even though the infection has. And since the beginning of last year (when I developed these symptoms) my pulse rate has shot through the roof at 120 sitting and 130+ standing and I wake up almost every night because my heart is pounding so hard. When I had an EKG the Dr. said although it was high he didn't see anything wrong.what has come back unusual is a low b-1, i have a little bit of blood, protein and keytones in my urine. I was checked for lupus and it came back negative, however, the doctor told me what they normally look for when a patient has lupus I had this 'thing' but it was only slightly elevated.That has been my problem, everything that comes back unusual is only slightly elevated or slightly\u00a0\u00a0lower than normal so the doctors don't seem to be paying attention to it.I'm 20 years old and until now have not had any health problems.",
