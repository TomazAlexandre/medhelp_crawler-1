    "question": "Does this mean there is no connection between gamma interferon and reversing cirrhosis?\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to tell from this study, because monotherapy ANYTHING rarely works for us.SVRs have elevated gamma levels.\u00a0\u00a0Interferon alfa is a cytokine.\u00a0\u00a0A cytokine is a messenger.\u00a0\u00a0The cytokine sequence goes like this:alfa IFN--->Interleukin 12--->gamma IFN.\u00a0\u00a0So far, we've tried monotherapy megadosing with each one of these cytokines.\u00a0\u00a0IL-12 killed a couple of alcoholics with advanced cirrhosis.\u00a0\u00a0Actually, they were hoping that shooting IL-12 would increase gamma production.Okay, here's the other deal.\u00a0\u00a0I know a person with lupus who is having trouble with connective tissue fibrosis.\u00a0\u00a0lupus people often experience interferon overload.\u00a0\u00a0More alfa means more IL-12 which means more gamma.\u00a0\u00a0So here, you've got fibrosis developing in a gamma environment.Then, there's the other deal.\u00a0\u00a0I take a drug called Avandia for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The drug is purported to reverse liver injury as an offshoot messaging sequence that goes along with controlling insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0Here's the kicker - Avandia is believed to reverse liver injury, and the drug inhibits IL-12 and gamma.So in the first case, you've got fibrosis in the presence of gamma.\u00a0\u00a0In the other case, you've got reversal in the absence of gamma.Does this mean that gamma interferon has nothing to do with repairing liver injury?\u00a0\u00a0Not necessarily.\u00a0\u00a0We don't yet fully understand the pathway.\u00a0\u00a0There may be a piece missing.",
