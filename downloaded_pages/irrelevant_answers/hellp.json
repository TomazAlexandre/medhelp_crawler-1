Well, at 13, you really need to work with your parents/guardians on this.\u00a0\u00a0We can tell you things here but until you are an adult, it is really up to your parents to do the shopping and make sure you have foods that will help you lose weight if that is what your doctor wants you to do.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor is also a great source of tips for this.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that, lean protein and vegis/fruits is the way to go.\u00a0\u00a0Cut back on carbs such as pasta, bread, potatoes, white rice and stick to a cleaner diet of the proteins that are lean and any vegi/fruit you want.\u00a0\u00a0Drink lots of water and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0make it a lifestyle change rather than a diet.\u00a0\u00a0Because restrictive diets almost always end up in initial weight loss quickly followed by gaining the weight back PLUS more pounds than where you started.But you do really need to talk to your parents.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",
