            "answer": "Hi,you HbA1c is pretty high.\u00a0\u00a0The meformin / glimiperide is not working so well.glimiperide is a sulfuronea, which is supposed to stimulate the pancreas to release more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0But it can also burn it out faster.I never took anything but metformin and when that didn't work, moved straight to insulin.I would recommend that you should tell your Dr that you cannot tolerate glimiperide and ask to be put on insulin.The most recent approach is to start partients on insulin early. If you start insulin while your own pancreas is still producing insulin, you can slow down the burn out and blood sugar is much easier and safer to control than if your pancreas has given up the ghost.Are you also trying to eat low carb?\u00a0\u00a0Low carb can also be very helpful in controlling blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0means avoiding fruit juices, sweetened drinks, cakes, candies, white flour prduction and getting most carbs from non-starchy veges and temperate (not sweet) fruits.",

            "answer": "I do eat low carb but give in to things I shouldn't....on special occasions. I know if I would get more exercise, the diabetes would probably go away. Because of a heart issue I wasn't able to exercise as much as I would have for the last couple of years and now that I'm doing ok in that respect I need to start pushing the exercise. I just really hate to go on insulin.",
