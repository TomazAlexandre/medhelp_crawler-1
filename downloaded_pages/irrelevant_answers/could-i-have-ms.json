He asked for my symptoms again and said...well...we're going to do an MRI of your brain.\u00a0\u00a0That is next week.\u00a0\u00a0I would actually like to change doctors because he is not very informative or helpful.\u00a0\u00a0He only seems to want to hear what he \"thinks\" is going on.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried to switch before but there is some kind of loyalty thing going on between the Doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Oh well...do either of you know if it were MS if it would all hit at once or does it start out slow?\u00a0\u00a0Do either of you have it?",

    "question": "I am a 44 year old female and have been having some odd episodes lately.\u00a0\u00a0If my muscles in my legs contract for any reason (walking downstairs, shivering from cold, stepping out of the car) the will tighten up so tight that I can not walk.Sometimes I will fall because they are so stiff.\u00a0\u00a0It only lasts for a few seconds but they are very weak afterwards and my right side is always weak.\u00a0\u00a0My right hand has started feeling wierd as well.\u00a0\u00a0I can tell it is also getting weak.\u00a0\u00a0I do have some autoimmune problems...T1 diabetes, Pernicious Anemia, and my thyroid has been removed but so far...all of that has been treatable.\u00a0\u00a0Just wondering if these latest episodes could be MS since it is autoimmune related?",
