            "answer": "Metformin really worked for me.\u00a0\u00a0The first month I was on it we became pg, but I ended up having an ectopic--nothing due to the metformin.\u00a0\u00a0I also took clomid.\u00a0\u00a0After the ectopic, we started follistim injections since my right side was damaged, RE wanted to produce more follicles on the left to get the job done.\u00a0\u00a0I am now pg again and will be 9 weeks Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0All is going very well.\u00a0\u00a0I was also told the metformin would help reduce the risk of a miscarrige.\u00a0\u00a0RE suggests I stay on metformin until 12 weeks or longer if needed.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, I will not end up on insilin.\u00a0\u00a0I would also advise you to stay away from carbs when you first start the metformin and when you increase your dosage.\u00a0\u00a0Eating foods with carbs and taking the metformin gave me serious stomach issues.\u00a0\u00a0Taking it with peanut butter helped.\u00a0\u00a0Now that my body is used to the metformin, I try to only eat whole grain carbs, but can stomach regular carbs now. Good luck to you!",
