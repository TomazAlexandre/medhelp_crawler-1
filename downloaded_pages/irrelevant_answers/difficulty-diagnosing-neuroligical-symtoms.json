    "question": "I'm a 49 y/o male.Two months ago, the day after a heart stress test,\u00a0\u00a0I experienced weakness from the knees down and numbness in the bottoms of my feet, mild headache, and a feeling of lightheadedness (off balance)--all this resulted in difficulty walking.About two weeks after the onset, I started to feel tingling on the left side of my body, from my face all the way down to my feet.I've had 4 MRIs (brain all the way down to lower back), lots of blood work (including checking for diabetes and thyroid), and leg emg. All results came back normal. I've seen a neurologist, primary care physician, orthopedic, and a neurology center at a renowned hospital. No one knows what is wrong with me.BTW, the stress test came back normal and no doc seems to think my problem is related to the stress test.After taking ibuprofen for the headache, I noticed that it relieved some of my neurological symptoms--then the PCP put me on 800mg/3 day and this relieved enough symptoms to allow me to function normally again. However, I believe that this is simply masking symptoms as I really don't feel like I'm improving more than 2 months later. In fact, I still have tingling in my hands and feet (more left than right, but both sides) , and occasional numbness on the bottom of both feet while on high doses of ibuprofen or naproxen. But these anti-inflammatories seems to relieve many symptoms.I'm on no other medications and am in good health otherwise (had a full physical just before falling ill) and in reasonable physical condition (I was exercising 3 times per weeks prior to falling ill and about 10 lbs overweight). I do have a long history of lyme disease, but I'm not showing any other lyme symptoms and after trying antibiotic treatments again, there has been no change in my neuro symptoms.Any ideas? What might these docs have missed? Might the stress test have a role in my problem?Thanks.",
