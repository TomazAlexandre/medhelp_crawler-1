            "answer": "1) Yes ALL interventions have risk, including catheterization.2) Catheterization, balloon and rings (stents) are all made in the same intervention if adequate, so the risk it is similar to the catheterizarion alone.3) Bypass is a different intervention, with more risks a longer recovery time, however the results are better in diabetic people.How has the dr. determined that a big part of his heart is in good shape? Does he perform any Magnetic Resonance?Jesus.",

            "answer": "As far as I can see Fumarate Acid it is not a diuretic. Bisoprolol Fumarate has and small diuretic activity.The normal diuretic used for HF is Furosemide (Lasix).Be aware that if he takes medicines for other problems (like ibuprofene) they can increase the fluid retention.600ml of liquid per day it is very very litle (liquid includes all sort of liquids not just water) He should not drink that little without periodic blood tests to be sure that there is no kidney damage. The normal dose for heart patients is about 1200ml of total liquid per day.Jesus",

            "answer": "Is he getting the Furosemide at home or in the hospital by vein? Is he urinating more than usual? Is his blood monitored?You need to understand that the swelling in his legs might not be due to the heart. What does the Dr. say?.How is his gout? The furosemide can aggravate it. Unfortunately most of the medication for the gout can aggravate the HF. He need to be carefully medicated.,The Diabetes can produce peripheral vascular disease, which can produce fluid accumulation in the legs that will not respond to diuretics.I am not a Dr. but If he is urinating good quantities and its blood analisys are good, the stents (rings) I do not think that will decrease the swelling, however it can increase its strength if really his heart needs more blood to work better.Is the catheterization still in plan for tomorrow? If yes, you will find soon.My thoughts are we you.Jesus",
