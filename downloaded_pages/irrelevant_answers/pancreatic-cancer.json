            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What other symptoms are present? It is good that the initial diagnostic tests were fine. The exact cause of pancreatic cancer is unknown but it is more common in people with diabetes, people with long-term inflammation of the pancreas or smokers. Early symptoms of pancreatic cancer include dark urine and clay-colored stools, fatigue and weakness, jaundice or yellow color in the skin, mucous membranes, or eyes; loss of appetite, upper abdominal pain, weight loss and even nausea and vomiting. Diagnosis is usually done with CT scan of the abdomen, ERCP, pancreatic biopsy, endoscopic ultrasound as well as MRI of the abdomen. You may ask for a referral or seek second opinion from another gastroenterologist to\u00a0\u00a0ease any worries. Further evaluation and regular follow-up may need to be done. Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hi, . i dont have diabetes, inflamation of pancreas and dont smoke.of the symptoms that you listed i have occasional upper right abdominal discomfort (comes and goes). my stool is not clay colored however does occasionally float but formed. always some shade of brown or sometimes a greenish tinge.the floating is what really causes me concern but i feel the doctors think they have done all appropriate tests. even tho the fecal fat test was not the 72hr one. I expressed my concern about my pancreas to both my primary and gastrologist. my gastrologist ordered the ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast just to ease my mind (i have health anxieties about cancer) and am seeking help. the ct scan was completely normal and he said every organ in my body has been checked. also had colonoscopy and endoscopy (which did show mild gastritis and gerd). I know i should take comfort and relax but im still nervous and feel like the doctors have done all they feel that they should do. is a ct scan with contrast a reliable test for pancreatic cancer that would be causing symptoms?",

    "question": "Hi, im 34 years old male , 6'2\" and 210 lbs. i have increased belching and gurgling stomach\u00a0\u00a0for about a year and lots of undigested vegetables in my stool (this symptom ive had for years). I was on aciphex for years because of gerd but was switched to dexilant for gastritis. Ive recently stopped taking the dexilant and am trying librax 4x a day and gurgling has decreased considerably. i am very regular with my bowel movements (once a day) so i dont see how it could be ibs. my stools float sometimes then slowly sink most of the time. (the floating stools make me very nervous!) I've been to my primary and a gastroentologist. these are the tests i have done so far: chest xrays (normal), ekg, cbc, liver and pancreas enzyme blood tests (all normal), upper gi series (showed some thickening of rugal folds), upper endoscopy with biopsy (mild gastritis and gerd, negative on celiac and h pylori), gallbladder ultrasound (normal), ct scan of abdomen and pelvis with contrast (normal), colonoscopy\u00a0\u00a0(normal), stool tests for fecal fat (not the 72hr one), parasites and infections (normal) and hida scan with cck (normal). I had lost weight but put it back on in the last 4 months. I do have health anxietys and am currently in therapy and taking vybrid for anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my question could all of this just be a combination of gerd slight ibs and high levels of stress and anxiety. with all of these tests wouldnt they have seen if something serious was causing my symptoms? I worry about pancreatic cancer , but if cancer was causing symptoms wouldnt one of these many test have seen it? Is the ct scan reliable for ruleing out pancreatic cancer I feel like I've exhaysted all my options and dont know what else to do.Thank you for your time and help",
