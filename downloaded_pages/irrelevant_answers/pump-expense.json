            "answer": "Hi Lucca's Mom!\u00a0\u00a0None of us are medical professionals, so any information you receive should be verified with your son's healthcare team.\u00a0\u00a0I want to start by telling you that my own\u00a0\u00a0daughter was 21 months old when she was diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0She's now 18 and doing extremely well - no complications!\u00a0\u00a0My heart goes out to you, but I wanted to share that with you to let you know that with the terrific advancements, like the insulin pump, their little bodies can grow up healthy & strong...she's living proof of that!To answer your question, I want to direct you to the JDRF website at www.jdrf.org.\u00a0\u00a0Do you belong to JDRF?\u00a0\u00a0On their website there's a section on the left side for newly diagnosed families where a member of the JDRF Online Diabetes Support Team can be assigned to your inquiry and you can receive advice/information from them.\u00a0\u00a0They even have the capability to direct you to your local JDRF chapter where there may be people in your area who have gone through what you are going through and may be able to direct you to a local agency where you may receive some assistance with your insurance.\u00a0\u00a0I live in New York and there is a Physically Handicapped Children's Program that helps out with copays based on a sliding scale, depending on your income.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is considered a physical disability, so there may be some type of agency in your state that your local JDRF office may direct you to if your state has one.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that this information has helped and good luck with your son.",

            "answer": "Hi Luccas mom -I am a newly IDDM r/t my pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I had my first appt with my endocrinologist today who said I am eligible for a new type of insulin pump that not only gives you doses of insulin, but this one also checks your blood sugars and gives you insulin accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0Supposedly it automatically adjusts your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0The clinic in Santa Monica, CA that I went to has been selected as part of a study for this pump, so it would be of absolutely no cost to me.I'm not sure what the qualifications for getting the pump are.\u00a0\u00a0The name of it is MiniMed Pump.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to my first information meeting about it in two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry I can't tell you more about it, but maybe you could google it to find if there are any study offices in your area.Best of luck to you and your son.",

    "question": "Does anyone know of any resources that we can look into, to help us pick up some of the pump cost that our insurance is not willing to cover.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor recommend the pump for my 20 month old son.\u00a0\u00a0However, we were just informed that our insurance will only cover 50%.\u00a0\u00a0This means that the pump alone will cost us $2500.00 out of pocket, not including the monthly cost of supplies.",
