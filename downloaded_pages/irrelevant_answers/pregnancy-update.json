    "question": "Hey Ladies. Haven't posted anything pertaining to my pregnancy in a while so here's an update! last Tuesday on the 13th, my husband and i took our children to the farm show complex. while thete, we saw many animals, cows being shaved and milked, chickens hatching etc. well i began sneezing and coughing uncontrollable but put it off as allergies. The next morning I woke up drenched in sweat and my body ached horribly. I checked my fasting blood sugar and\u00a0\u00a0itwas 20!!!! (I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes about two weeks ago). Not only that i had ketones in my urine. I remember in diabetes and nutrition that a fever could make your sugars run high/low or show ketones in your urine. so i took my tenperature and it was 102.5! At this point I'm panicking. I immediately pop two tylenol and eat some breakfast. check my sugars and they're through the roof . i recheck my temperature and its down to 101.9. i try to lay down and my world spins, not to mention, my stomach is tightening every so often. Now I'm really freaking out. i finally call my OB and she has me go straight to the triage! I had the flu!!!!!!!! So much for getting the flu shot. It did nothing. so I'm pumped with fluids and sent home on tamiflu and tylenol. Go home to my babies to wake up to my 4 year old daughter burning up with fever! take her to the pediatrician, she has the flu!!!!! smh. it's been quite the week but i managed to keep my husband and my 8 year old flu free. Little momma is recovering and her febrile rash is starting the clear up. On a brighter note i got a free breast pump from my insurance, it's a melodi. And i am now far enough along that i am seeing the doc every two weeks now. I am waiting on labor and delivery to call to schedule my csection. I'm so glad i got through the week and i\u00a0\u00a0feeling much better. Hope all is well with everyone's pregnancies!!!!",
