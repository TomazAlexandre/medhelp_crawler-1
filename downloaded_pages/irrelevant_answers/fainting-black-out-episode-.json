            "answer": "It's hard to tell from just an episode of syncope. It could be because she hadn't eaten, it could be because she was overheated, or it could be something is going on with her. I suffered from a similar thing about 4 years ago, except I went into the doctor because I thought I had gotten a concussion and got an MRI done and found out that I had a type of brain tumor that had hemorrhaged which caused me to pass out. I'm not saying this is what is wrong with your daughter, but I would keep close eye on her and maybe get her into the doctor to see if maybe she could even have a vitamin deficiency (maybe make sure she is eating more iron -- by taking supplements or eating foods with high iron in them).",

    "question": "I had a terrible scare yesterday, my 12 yr old daughter came into the kitchen stopped at the door way, looked to her right, her face went blank and she melted/collapsed to the floor, I ran over to her she was laying flat\u00a0\u00a0and her body jerked, I thought she was going to convulse, but when I touched her she sat up complained her foot hurt (she hit it on the way down) but said she had just blacked out, like no big deal. She said this has happened before, that she just stood up to fast.\u00a0\u00a0She also hadn't eaten. This scared the hell out of me, what is going on with my baby?",
