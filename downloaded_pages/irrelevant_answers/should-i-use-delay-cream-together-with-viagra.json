            "answer": "Hello,An erection problem is the inability to get or maintain an erection that is firm enough for a man to have intercourse. If the condition persists, the medical term is erectile dysfunction. Before deciding the treatment it is important to find out the cause which may be responsible for erectile dysfunction in your case. In most men of your age and since you were having regular erections earlier, the cause looks more like psychological. Other medical causes may be diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord and neurological causes.You can take Viagra and use the delay creams simultaneously.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
