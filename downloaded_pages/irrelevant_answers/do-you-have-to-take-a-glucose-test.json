It will tell you rather or not you have gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It needs to be treated because it would have adverse health effects on you and the baby. Its really not that bad honestly!

Took my blood sugars regularly & whatever.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't have it though.\u00a0\u00a0This time I took the one hour test & failed it because I got sick. I decided to opt out of the 3 hour test because the drink is a lot stronger & u must keep it down ALL 3 hours. My doctor even agreed that I would be better off not to tourcher myself & just go about things like we did last time. I take my blood sugars & stuff now & they have never been off so we're pretty sure I dont have it.",

            "answer": "I guess it could be different in the states but here in Canada my midwife gave me a choice because I am very low risk of getting it. And she makes me pee on this stick that tests for surgar in your urine she said if I was to get it there will be surgar in my urine then I can go in and get tested if we feel I have it. As well the first test you do is NOT a gaurentee you have it, if you fail it doesn't mean you have gestational diabetes it means that there's a possibility and you will have to go for more testing. She gave us a hand out and told us to talk about it then we can decide to do it or not, my husband and I felt that I didn't need to do it so I didn't. I don't want any negative comments about our choice not to do it. My midwife told me if she feels I need to get it done she will tell me and she said I'm low risk and fine, if however, I spill sugar into my urine then she would recommend that I go in for the second test to be safe. It's You baby and body if you don't want to do it don't. I'm 28 weeks and 4 days and our baby is measuring right on track not to big which with gb he would probably be bigger, and he's healthy and happy and I have not spilled surgar into my urine.",
