            "answer": "Very interesting -- sadly so that you're both diabetic now.\u00a0\u00a0One reason that the term \"Type 1\" diabetes was coined was to allow the disease name to be inclusive of all of us, regardless of age of onset, who happen to be adults.It's terrific that you're pumping, since while it does take time to get things levelled out, once you \"get there,\" you'll find more stability with a pump than with any other treatment plan. Many newly diagnosed also experience a period of time -- months, up to a year or more -- that we call a \"honeymoon.\"\u00a0\u00a0During taht time, our bodies are still making some insulin, tho' it's not predictable -- and the beta cells will gradually fail completely.It's possible that your hypos result, in part, from your body choosing to squirt out insulin that you weren't counting on.\u00a0\u00a0Then, sometimes we overcorrect adn end up high. Sometimes, even without overcorrecting, we can end up high if our liver kicks in and helps counteract the low.It's possible that CDE (certified diabetes educator) or nutritionist can work with you and your wife to ease this transition a bit.If you're a record-keeper, it'd be great to track your BG (maybe your meter can do that for you), since we often can discover a pattern of highs/lows and then respond to the pattern ... then watch for response, etc.Back to your original posting, you are the first couple I've \"met\" where the diagnoses were so close together and of different types.\u00a0\u00a0The good news is that you can be terrific support to one another.",

            "answer": "Have you had a definitive diagnosis of diabetes by a physician?\u00a0\u00a0If not, it's a good idea to keep track of your symptoms (and, blood sugar levels) to share with your doctor soon.If I understood your message correctly, your random blood sugar tests are normal.\u00a0\u00a0A Type 1 diabetic, untreated, will not have normal blood sugars -- at least not for long and certainly not after meals.\u00a0\u00a0Again, however, it's important to discuss wiht your doctor the symptoms you've noticed, even with normal blood sugar.Some of the classic diabetes symptoms can be associated with other things.\u00a0\u00a0For examples, more frequent urination is not uncommon as males age and is sometimes related to an enlarged prostate.It's also possible that you're developing some \"sympathetic\" symptoms and/or are more acutely aware of patterns that you didn't necessarily notice before.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, some medications can put a strain on the insulin-response-and-production cycles and so it's good to discuss that with your doctor.Type 1 diabetes is much less common than type 1, and yet it can develop in adults.\u00a0\u00a0That's even less common, tho' I've known Type 1s who were diagnosed in their 30s or 40s.",

I am now on a pump but still have very erratic blood glucose control.\u00a0\u00a0I check my blood glucose 6-8 times per day and count carbs carefully.\u00a0\u00a0However I do not go 1 day without experiencing hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia.",

            "answer": "I have undergone constant blood glucose monitoring for a week which included fasting and eating the same meals all week. The endocrinologist was sure that the adjustments to my basal and bolus rates would even out my blood glucose.\u00a0\u00a0However my BG is still erratic and seems to follow no consistent patterns.\u00a0\u00a0I often drop to the 40's\u00a0\u00a0or rise to 200-400 almost every day.\u00a0\u00a0My Ha1c reading last time was 6.5. It seems to me that I had better control when I was taking Lantis and humulog shots and I wonder if I should give up on the pump. How much damage is being done if my BG rises above 200 for a short time such as a few hours.\u00a0\u00a0I check my BG 6-8 times a day because I cannot feel the hypos or the hypers.",

            "answer": "Hi again, PlantDoc,Sheesh, how frustrating!\u00a0\u00a0I'm also a pumper and found that this book was very helpful for me.\u00a0\u00a0It's at many bookstores, including Amazon.com and might be in a local JDRF resource room, too.It's called,Pumping Insulin, Everything you need to Know for Success with an Insulin Pump, by Ruth Roberts & John Walsh.\u00a0\u00a0The most current edition is from 2000, I think.There are folks who do better on shots than with the pump and you might be one of them.My guess is that you've had your pump \"technique\" evaluated so that you are certain that you're getting a good flow of insulin, that the insulin is fresh, etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0I did read reports from folks using some of Minimed's Quick Set PLUS infusion sets that many are defective and give unpredictable results.\u00a0\u00a0It's certainly worth a toll-free call to the pump & infusion set mfgr to see if there're any QC issues with yours.Many pumpers, myself included, have found that (1) Novolog is much more stable in our pumps than Humalog, (2) changing infusion sets, cartridge/reservoir, tubing (and not reusing these disposables) twice a week is helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, after years of using a 30degree infusion set, I changed to use the shorter 90 degree set that works with \"spring loaded\" inserter.\u00a0\u00a0While I resisted that change for quite a while, I find that these work well for me and the insertion is ... as they say ... virtually painless.Seems like the right time to challenge your endo/CDE to show that pumping (for you) is a superior treatment plan to your Lantus/Novolog.\u00a0\u00a0Will you keep us posted?\u00a0\u00a0I wish you improvements SOON!",

    "question": "I just turned 59 and suddenly developed all the symptoms of type 1 diabetes. My wife had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes a few months earlier and because she had a glucometer I had tested my glucose to find it was normal. I am wondering how I can develop diabetes overnight without any previous symptoms. It seems strange that both of us get diabetets at about the same time but different types of diabetets. Any thoughts?",
