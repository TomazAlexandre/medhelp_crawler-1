            "answer": "I hope I can help you calm down, it's nowhere as bad as you think.Chlamydia is an STD that can be contracted from oral sex. It can be easily cured with antibiotics, usually within 7-10 days. During the course of treatment, you should refrain from sex to make sure the infection is gone. You need to let the woman you were with know of your infection so she can get treated as well. If not, she will continue to infect any other sexual partners. If you have been diagnosed with chlamydia, then I'm sure the doctor has already put you on antibiotics. You'll be fine.Why are you scared you had diabetes? Did you have blood work done that showed elevated blood sugar levels? Was the test an A1C? Had you done at least a 12 hour fast before the blood draw? Did your doctor tell you you were \"pre-diabetic?\" If these questions have not been answered, and you are so frightened you've had anxiety issues, then you need to see your doctor again......specifically for the purpose of establishing your blood sugar levels over a period of time which will rule diabetic concerns \"in or out.\" If you have insurance, I would recommend you see an endochronologist. Don't be afraid. IF, perchance, you DO have diabetes, finding out now is the best thing you can do. Millions of people live perfectly long and healthy lives with diabetes. And if you're \"pre-diabetic,\" that can actually be reversed through diet and exercise.You did NOT have an exposure so you do NOT have HIV. And NO, you do NOT need to test.If you are having a lot of health anxiety, you may want to consider some therapy to learn how to overcome it. Trust me, it's a lousy way to live.PeaceGreenlydia",
