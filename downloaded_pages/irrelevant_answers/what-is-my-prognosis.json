            "answer": "Your stenosis still require no intervention and should be treatable with meds and some lifestyle changes. I would not be concerned with prognosis at this time because with the proper intervention including meds, exercise and diet you should have a normal life unless there's something here I'm missing.You need to do everything you can to slow or stop the progression of your blockages. Is your cholesterol under control? How about your blood pressure? What meds have your doctors put you on so far? Do you have other risk factors that can be controlled like being overweight or smoking? If so, losing some weight and not smoking would be a great start. How about a family history of early onset heart disease?Again, with the proper changes in your life to control the progression of your CAD, I don't see why you need to worry about your life being shorter than anyone else's. Just make sure to get these looked at as often as your doctors say, most likely yearly.Good luck!Jon",
