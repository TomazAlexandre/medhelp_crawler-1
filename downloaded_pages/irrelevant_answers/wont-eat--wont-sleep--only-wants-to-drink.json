            "answer": "She had extensive blood work done at her 2nd birthday doctor's visit. Everything was fine.\u00a0\u00a0 Recently - in the past 2 weeks, my husband and I decided to give her more milk and/or juice instead of the water and also to refuse to give it to her on demand.\u00a0\u00a0This seems to be helping, she will cry a little for it, then stop.\u00a0\u00a0Also, from day 1 that we gave her less water, she\u00a0\u00a0has been sleeping for longer periods of time at night and has even slept through the night a few times - which she never did before.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I am hoping that this is just a habit - like having the cup is her security blanket in a way.Thanks for the info and advice - by the way, sweetpea - what kind of supplements?\u00a0\u00a0I put vitamin drops in her 1st milk cup of the day.\u00a0\u00a0Is there something else out there?thanks:)",

            "answer": "Pediasure has more calories in it and added vitamins. I know for children with more severe problems, medically, they would use a gastrostomy tube(g tube) and do feedings that way with a formula that is used. though I'm blanking out on what exactly it is. You can try googling it to see what comes up. you're mostly just looking to add more protein for her, since fluids won't contain it.",
