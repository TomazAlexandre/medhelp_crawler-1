            "answer": "I don't have any websites to back this, but I am an RN. I know that type 2 (even type 1, type 1 can be controlled without insulin, but with diet and excersise) diabetes would be diagnosed with a specific blood test called an A1C, you can't alter or change it, it's type specific.As for cirrhosis, I believe that biopsy or scans will show the scarring or necrosis or hardening of tissue. Outward signs of cirrhosis would be yellowing of the whites of the eyes or even the skin.",

            "answer": "I'll start by saying that Cirrhosis of the Liver due to alcohol abuse is very tricky to identify before it is too late and has taken it's toll. Nowe there is a chance that since you are asking, you may be symptomatic and the Cirrhosis/Fibrosis could be impacting your glucose/sugar processing. A few of the deadly results of Cirrhosis are Portal Hypertension which is a back up of blood due to scarring in the liver and the inability of the blood to flow. Even a small amount of Cirrhsosis/Fibrosis can have a very serious impact on Portal Hypertension which is one of the primary causes of death in Cirrhosis. Basically you end up bleeding to death with burst blood vessels in the esophagus or stomach. There is another insidious problem in that once you have Cirrhosis you stop processing alcohol through your liver as efficiently and you become even more addicted because you have a higher concentration of acohol in your blood stream. It has been proven that alcoholics with Cirrhosis have a much harder time being abstinent because of this and that they generally feel ill and want to feel good, so it is a catch 22. The best place I can tell you to research Liver Cirrhosis is www.pubmed.gov YOu will find a wealth of information there and you will also notice that there is no recovery from alcoholic Cirrhosis after a certain point which is a fine line. However, if you can catch it in time, you have a chance at slowly reversing the damage and living a normal lifespan. Obviously, you can't drink and you must take care of yourself. I make swure to get plenty of excercise and keep the weight down and blood sugar undwer control. High blood sugar can lead to fatty liver along with diabetes. Fatty liver in combination with Cirrhosis is not good. So take care of yourself. Don't drink. Good luck!",

            "answer": "I also want to add that Cirrhosis is frequently missed when trying to detect it through measuring liver function tests such as ALT and AST. These tests\u00a0\u00a0can be normal and you can still have Cirrhosis, that is why it is so tricky to catch in time. A liver biopsy is the only sure way to get a status on your liver's health.",
