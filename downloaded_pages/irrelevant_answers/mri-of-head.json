            "answer": "HI and welcome,It's always best to get the opinion of your doctor, but from my lay persons understanding, your MRI report is suggesting what is evident on your MRI would be consistent with the findings of ischemic small vessel disease (normal 65+, hypertension, diabetes etc) or Migraines, and since you had your MRI done because of horrible Migraines, that might be the diagnosis it ends up being....Cheers........JJ",

    "question": "I had an MRI done last week, due to having horrible migraines.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor called me today to go over results and is sending me to a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if you could please help me in layman's terms.My results read:Several small scattered areas of increased signal intensity are seen within the white matter of both cerebral hemispheres on the FLAIR and T2 weighted images.\u00a0\u00a0Their MRI is nonspecific.\u00a0\u00a0They could represent areas of minimal small vessel ischemic disease. Alternatively they can be seen in patients with migraines.\u00a0\u00a0 No acute parenchymal abnormality is seen.",
