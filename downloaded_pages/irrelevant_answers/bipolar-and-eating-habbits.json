            "answer": "Diabetes can be a side effect of some medications, most generally atypical antipsychotics. But regardless of where its from, if you have diabetes you have to take eating a healthy diet very seriously. Your psychiatrist should refer you to a nutritionist for that. Medications can make people lose or gain weight (the Clonidine I am on makes me want to overeat for example) but when people are manic they tend to eat more and lose weight because they are speeded up and when depressed people can either eat less as they are too depressed to eat or sometimes eat more as a form of self medication. I wouldn't want to post any specifics about healthy eating other than eating breakfast is an absolute neccessity. Three healthy meals a day and other basics. But if you have diabetes your psychiatrist might want you to be on a very specific diet to control sugar intake and a doctor should advise you more of that.",

            "answer": "I work with patients with diabetes every day. Diabetes type 2 is caused by environment and genetics. (For example over eating mixed with family history of type 2 puts you at high risk.) Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune deficiency. As for either type of diabetes if you are having trouble with your nutrition you should see a Certified Diabetes Educator. If you have type 1 you should have an endocrinologist. Having a good diabetes care team and the right treatment along with healthy diet is what will keep you in control of your blood glucose.Also, being bipolar and having diabetes will be trouble. Stress in itself causes your blood sugar to rise.Personally I have trouble eating both ways. If I am high anxiety I can't eat. Then when the anxiety goes away I eat too much. I also have a lot of issues with food, too much to go into here. I don't know if it the BP or something else.",
