We have found in our surveys of Sugar Sense app users that these are main concerns for them: how their family eats being unhealthy for them and feeling like they're making their family have to avoid foods they love. We don't have any information about it yet for users, but it is a topic we're addressing. Thank you for your post and your concern for your wife. Hopefully more members will respond with tips for you.",
