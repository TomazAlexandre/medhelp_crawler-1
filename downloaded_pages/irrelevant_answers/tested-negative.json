    "question": "Hi DocI have recently been separated from my wife and have had unprotected sex twice, do have associated anxiety and general stress associated. 1st encounter I had symptoms of a rash and discomfort, the girl had no symptoms but we both did a std check bloods and swab and negative on all counts. Applied thrush cream and rash went away. I met another girl and stupidly had unprotected sex again and have since had symptoms after sex. Started with inflammation on the head of the penis and a pain when I coughed (don't necessarily think there is pain when I urinate) The pain went away after a few days but I now have a red spot/sore and occasional discomfort and tingling, I have been applying the thrush cream from day after conception. (Kenacomb at night after shower and Clotrimazole anti fungal cream during the day as recommended by doctor) I have since been back to see the doctor and conducted a full blood and urine sample for all the usual std checks and HIV, all negative.... The doctor didn't really seem to fussed. I have also had the shakes in my hands which I have never had in my life before, but no other significant symptons. The doc thought it may have been diabetes but liver function was normal and is checking now for thyroid issues.I was unhappy with the diagnosis and the doctors concern so I asked for antibiotics for the apparent thrush and was prescribed IALEX 500MG cephalexin 3 tablets a day. I have been on antibiotics for 3 days now and continued cream but the sore has not changed in any way, better or worse.Any advice on where to go from here or thoughts would be greatly appreciated. Causing more unwanted stress.Thanks",
