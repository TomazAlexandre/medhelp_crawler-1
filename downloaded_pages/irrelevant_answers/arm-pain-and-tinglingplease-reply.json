            "answer": "Hello,There are a few possibilities which need to be ruled out.They are diabetes,carpal tunnel syndrome, Golfer\u2019s or tennis elbow, neurological disease like Charcot-Marie-Tooth disorder, osteomyelitis( inflammation or infection of bone and bone marrow),peripheral vascular disease,spondolysis,cardiac causes and thoracic outlet syndrome.Without clinical examination and investigations diagnosis is tough.I feel that an examination by an orthopedician will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
