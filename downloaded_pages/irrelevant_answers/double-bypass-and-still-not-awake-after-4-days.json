            "answer": "I would imagine it would depend on \"why\" she hasn't awoke yet, whether there is reason to worry, but you will worry regardless.My Dad had major anurysm surgery sveral years ago and it took him 19 days to wake up completely.\u00a0\u00a0Before he woke up, his eyes were open and he was talking, but he wasn't making any sense, and seemed to be living in a fantasy world. The cause was unknown, but we think the hospital overdosed him on morphine, and just were refusing to admit their mistake.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, he did come out it and went back to life as normal, so don't give up hope.",
