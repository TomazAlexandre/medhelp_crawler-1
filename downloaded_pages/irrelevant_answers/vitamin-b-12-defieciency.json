            "answer": "Dear JGrip,Wow.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a doctor, but I am very interested in the idea that what a person eats or what medication a person takes causes health issues.\u00a0\u00a0I apologize ahead of time for this long post, but I want to help when I can and leave no stone unturned.\u00a0\u00a0What has happened to you is a little unusual.\u00a0\u00a0B12 deficiency does lead to a lot of very serious complications, and it has to go on for a pretty good while to do that.\u00a0\u00a0There are a few things that may have caused your B12 deficiency, enough to where you ended up with nerve damage.The simple causes include:\u00a0\u00a0Diet, of course, because many young adults eat poorly, so I'm assuming you've now learned to include eggs, cheese, nuts, and various meat sources in your daily meals, if you weren't before.\u00a0\u00a0Also, sometimes people who are allergic to wheat will end up with a B12 deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Rarely adolescent stress will cause it, some acid-reducing medicines might cause it, and drug and alcohol abuse can lead to deficiency also.\u00a0\u00a0All those things you can remedy yourself.More involved causes include:\u00a0\u00a0A malapsorption disorder in the digestive system or an automimmune disorder, neither of which I know anything about, but you can ask your doctor what he thinks about those things as relates to you.\u00a0\u00a0And then there's Multiple Sclerosis, which can happen to young people.\u00a0\u00a0MS sometimes shows up as a B12 deficiency, but since it comes with a host of additional neurological deficits, which you did not list, probably you don't have that.Lastly, the pain you are feeling could be from diabetes, which young adults can also get.\u00a0\u00a0Could be you had both a B12 problem AND diabetes, in which case you need to have your blood sugars checked.\u00a0\u00a0I've had a couple younger friends who had to give themselves insulin shots several times a day, did it right in the workplace or wherever they were.As for your medication, if the stuff he's giving you now is no longer working, then obviously you need a different drug or different dose.\u00a0\u00a0As for another doctor's help, you could perhaps visit a neurologist, see what he thinks, and maybe he can do some investigative tests or refer you to someone else.\u00a0\u00a0They really are great at sorting out mysterious nerve disorders.I'm sorry this happened to you.\u00a0\u00a0I was in a car wreck when I was 20 years old, and it affects me to this day, and I'm in my 50s now.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't handle it very well, took me years to get past it, and much of my life is left in ruins behind me.\u00a0\u00a0And so, even though the last thing you want to hear is go see a psychotherapist, because you're not crazy, I think a good counselor, even on a temporary basis, can be a positive compass for dealing with such compromising obstacles in life.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, you don't have to \"drop out\" of school.\u00a0\u00a0You can get a medical leave of absence if things get really out of hand, you know, miss a quarter.\u00a0\u00a0My best friend in college did that, so glad when she came back, she was number one in her freshman class of 3,000 people.GG",

    "question": "I am an 18 year old male college student. I was diagnosed one year ago with a vitamin b-12 deficiency. I began taking monthly injections to return my levels to normal. The cause of my drop in b-12 was never determined. About 2 months ago my symptoms of burning, stinging, sharp pain returned. My doctor checked my b-12 level which was determined to be at 3000. Since my level was said to be normal it was assumed by my doctor that i was suffering from peripheral neuropathy caused by nerve damage during the period I went without enough b-12. I am now taking Gabapentin 300mg which seemed to help at first but no longer does. I am concerned with what caused my b-12 to be low last year and whether I am suffering from an underlying condition as well that is also contributing to my chronic pain. Can someone please help me? My pain has gotten so bad to the point where it is difficult for me to continue going to classes daily. I don't want to have to drop out of school over this.",
