            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Are you suffering from optic neuritis? Any nerve for that matter if it is completely degenerated cannot be regenerated, but there are certain vitamins which can improve the function of nerves and nervous system. Nervous function and muscular coordination requires the presence of B vitamins along with the vitamin E in good quantities within the body, any resulting or existing deficiencies in these vitamins will ensure weaknesses to overcome the musculature.Since nutrients such as the vitamin B12, the mineral calcium and the essential mineral magnesium are vital for nervous system, which in turn regulates muscles-these nutrients must also be taken in regular and consistent amounts with the diet.Vitamin D may have a direct effect on the eyes, and it is vital for maintaining overall good health. Food sources of vitamin D include butter, egg yolk, fish liver oils, fatty fish such as salmon, tuna, herring, sardines, and liver and oysters. Pantothenic acid might be called a brain chemical. A deficiency may result in nerve and optic degeneration. Major sources of pantothenic acid include liver, kidney, heart, brewer's yeast, sunflower seeds, peanuts, buckwheat flour, royal bee jelly, egg yolk, bran, fish, and whole-grain cereals.Hope this information helps.Best.",
