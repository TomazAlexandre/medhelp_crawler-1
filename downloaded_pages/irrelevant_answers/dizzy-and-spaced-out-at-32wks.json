    "question": "Im 32wks +4 days and starting to get light headed a few mins after i eat dinner or snacks.it only lasts a few mins but i feel totally spaced out and my eyes feel funny. Its starting to become more frequent now. I did have to get tested for the gestational diabetes the other day so i will be getting the results of that on tuesday. My baby is well above average size and ive alot of fluid around her. So i more than likely have the diabetes, but could all this be related??? My iron levels seem to be fine.",
