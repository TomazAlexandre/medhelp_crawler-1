            "answer": "Given the heart history of our family I think it reasonable for you to be sure to get at least an electrocardiogram with you next physical exam.\u00a0\u00a0That process should also include giving your examining doctor the history you have shared here.As for your HR, a rate of 96 while up and walking around isn't particularly high, I would not worry about that by itself.",

    "question": "I've been having weird feelings in my chest, my heart feels like it's racing and fluttering when i'm sitting.\u00a0\u00a0The other day when i was at the gym, it sped up and was pounding so hard and fast i was getting dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0I know your heart rate goes up working out, but this was not a new exercise, and i couldn't get it to slow down for almost 10 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Even sitting i can feel it speed up once in a while, and when i was grocery shopping i stopped to check my blood pressure on the machine and it was at 96.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what is too fast when a person isn't doing much walking.\u00a0\u00a0I exercise several times a week and I take in very little caffeine so I dont think that is a factor. We have a history of heart problems in my family, my grandfather had a heart attack at 28 and died from his second at 68, my aunt passed away at 65 from congestive heart disease and an aneurism in her heart.\u00a0\u00a0We also have a history of diabetes and everyone in my immediate family has high blood pressure, though i have neither.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 5'8, 135 lbs so I'm not overweight. I'm just wondering if this is something I should be concerned with enough to go to my doctor, or if it's nothing to worry about.Thanks,Kathleen",
