    "question": "My 13 yr old son has been seeing a therapist for 4 years. He has been diagnosed with ADHD and ODD. Now they think he may have mild Aspergers. How can I tell? He is moody, doesn't make eye contact ( eyes dart around instead of looking at you), gets hyper-focused on things, did not say a word until about 31/2 yrs old, was very clumsy as a child, doesn't communicate well, and does not display a lot of emotions, very unorganized, grade have started dropping at school. He is very bright, especially in math, an IQ of 137. He also has hyper-thyroidism, being treated, and type 1 diabetes ( since he was 3) and is being treated.Any help would be great. I feel so lost. I don't know how to help him.",
