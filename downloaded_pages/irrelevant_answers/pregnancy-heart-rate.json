    "question": "My resting heart rate is anywhere in between 80-100bpm but after walking through the grocery store is gets up to 115bpm. I deal with anxiety big time so even \"resting\" I'm anxious. Should I be worried about these numbers? Some days I can feel my heart pounding in my chest all throughout the day. That scares me too. I'm obsessing over it and I'm not sure if that's my problem too. I just want to know if anyone else has dealt with this and if getting over 100 when just walking through a store while pregnant is normal? I'm almost 6.5 months preg.",
