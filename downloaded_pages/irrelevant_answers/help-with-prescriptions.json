    "question": "We have health insurance and have been getting along fine for the last 3 years. Now all of a sudden we are having to pay for needles and my sons insulin doubled in price. The insurance company and the pharmacy say its because of the wording of the dosage. His dosage on his lantus only went up 4 units a day. I get the same exact box as I always did but now its costing me double. His Humalog also went up $10.00 for no reason anyone can think of. Instead of paying $95.00 like I thought it ended up costing $255.00. We live paycheck to paycheck and since moving to a small town I haven't been able to find a job. There will be no Christmas this year and we are barely getting by. I have asked various places for help but since my husband has a job and we have health insurance we are turned down. Can anyone help us?",
