            "answer": "Check her mattress.\u00a0\u00a0I had pain in my legs and numbness, pain and tingling in my hips and feet.\u00a0\u00a0Turns out my mattress was cutting off circulation when I slept.\u00a0\u00a0Try a softer and more supportive mattress, plus have her elevate her feet when sitting in a chair (as the pressure on the backs of her knees can cut off circulation.)\u00a0\u00a0You have to watch for ways she sits/stands/leans and lays down that would cut off circulation.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that, cut out caffeine and she may see some improvement.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps!",

            "answer": "It does sound like diabetes with the problem being a circulation problem. Make sure your mom is exercising everyday, even if that means just walking. Ask your doctor if she can get on a good low fat diet, high in veggies. If she eats meat - only eat fish, turkey and chicken and not beef. Cut out sugary junk food. Turmeric and cayenne are good for blood circulation. Add those to her diet, again if her doctor approves. Ask your doctor if she can take a baby aspirin a day which will help with circulation and if you get the all clear from your doctor, try that. Also make sure your mom is not overweight. Overweight combines with diabetes to compound circulation problems. Take care.",

            "answer": "Whenever a doctor ascribes a symptom to stress I find another doctor. That is a cop out for \"I don't know.\" Remember when stomach ulcers were caused by \"stress,\" and people paid $$$ to psychologists and psychiatrists to cure them of their ailment. Well, it turned out to be a bug.",
