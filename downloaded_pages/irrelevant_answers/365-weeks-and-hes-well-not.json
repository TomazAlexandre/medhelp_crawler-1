    "question": "I had another ultrasound today and my little boy is just thriving in there I guess! He's measuring at 40 weeks, his head is on the bigger side and he weighs approximately 8lbs 14oz. My midwife was called out to deliver a baby so I couldn't really talk with her about it. I also had another glucose test today, because mothers with gestational diabetes tend to have larger babies and we were just covering all the bases. The ultrasound technician even wants to know what he weighs when I deliver! With daily contractions since 23 weeks and just being plain miserable, I am ready to meet my little man as soon as possible! He seems ready, and I know I am!",
