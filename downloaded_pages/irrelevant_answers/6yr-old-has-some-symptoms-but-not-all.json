            "answer": "I think it would be very wise to have your daughter checked out by a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0Having a blood test called a Fasting Plasma Glucose Test (FPG) or an Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT)is probably what they will suggest.\u00a0\u00a0I think that any time you have any questions about your childs health, mental or physical you should call your pediatrician.\u00a0\u00a0It is always better to find out sooner rather than later if there is diabetes or any other health problem.\u00a0\u00a0I have been worried at times that my son is urinating too frequently or not eating enough or too much juice.\u00a0\u00a0I have tested his blood with my own glucometer.Some of the symptoms you have mentioned your daughter has been experiencing do sound suspicous.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetic symptoms are frequent urination, constant thirst, lethargy and moodiness.",

            "answer": "Rule of Thumb - and I'm not being mean ... if you're concerned, have a doctor test her for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It's worth the money (if that's an issue) to save your child's life.\u00a0\u00a0Everything else is just second guessing ... and Diabetes is not a chronic illness to second guess with.\u00a0\u00a0(Since you know Type 2s, you already know this fact.)That way, you'll either put your mind at ease or be able to take the next steps for treatment.Fruity smelling breath, constant hunger, wanting sweets, wanting water - can be tell tale signs of Diabetes .... or the signs of some other issue.Frequent Urination = Constant Urination.\u00a0\u00a0And by that I mean almost living in the bathroom with urine that is coming out as clear as the water you just drank.",

I have scheduled her for a glucose test this Wed.\u00a0\u00a0And you are right that I do understand the seriousness of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was supposed to donate my kidney to my uncle but unfortunately he never got healthy enough for the transplant.Thanks again for your kindness.",

            "answer": "One more thing that has not been mentioned... hypoglycemia. Some kids develop LOW glucose levels before developing diabetes. It may be smart to also ask the doctor to do a random glucose check at about 1:30, the time when she is normally starting to show symptoms that something is wrong. I notice that when my glucose levels drop low, my mouth gets dry, which feels somewhat like the thirst caused by HIGH glucose levels. So a fasting sugar test and perhaps a random test at 1:30 would be what I would ask for. Glucose levels change all day long, and so if the test is done only as a fasting pre-breakfast test and she DOES NOT have diabetes, then your doctor will tell you that nothing is abnormal. Testing her during one of her \"spells\" may be smart.",

            "answer": "That is an excellent idea. We went in yesterday for a 12 hour fasting glucose test and the doctor (after discussing my reasons and her symptoms) decided to just give her the finger ***** test.\u00a0\u00a0She came in at 104 - which is not diabetes but high enough to schedule futher testing. We went in for another 12 hour fast lab test this morning and I won't have the results for a few days.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor WAS surprised at the 104 because he really thought she would come in around 60 to 70.I wish I had a meter to test her at 1:30... can you rent one anywhere?",

    "question": "My daughter's teacher and I have been discussing the possibility of her having diabetic symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0After doing some research I have noted that she has some of the symptoms but not all.\u00a0\u00a0She craves (with a capital C) sweets.\u00a0\u00a0She has melt downs if we don't feed her immediately.\u00a0\u00a0She drinks water incessantly and pees frequently (although to be honest I'm not sure what over-excessive urination actually is.. how many trips to pee is too many?)\u00a0\u00a0What started this discussion was she has major melt downs in the class and we noticed it happened around the same time everyday.\u00a0\u00a0She is at school at 7:30AM - snack at 9:00 - lunch at 10:50 AM - and meltsdown around 1:30PM and screaming for food all the way home from school like she's going to die if she doesn't eat!\u00a0\u00a0I started taking crackers and juice for her to eat on our 5 minute walk home from school because it was exhausting telling her we'd be home in five minutes and she could eat then.\u00a0\u00a0Our teacher & I decided to allow her to step outside the classroom by herself and eat a quick snack at 1:30 and that seems to control the irritability.I have no idea what I should be smelling on her breath or anything else.\u00a0\u00a0Is what I've written enough to ask for a test?\u00a0\u00a0Or Do you think this is just normal for a cooped up child?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for any help you may provide me.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to know what made you (as parents) think diabetes and actually go for testing?PS: Type 2 runs in my family but not Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0My uncle just passed away from renal failure as did my grandmother. Mom has it as well as my sister.",
