Use to only eat the food I grew when I was a young vegetarian hippi living on 40 acres...those were the days, but good eating habits have always stayed with me and my weight has not changed since I was a teenager. But as my work life got more hectic and I started traveling all the time I started slipping up and started eating junk food at airports etc - it is interesting that all my worse sicknesses were after I was eating unhealthy. (RA , IC, IBS, Colitis etc) I have learned my lesson...but strangly enough have added white chocolate to my diet. I have become addicted to Lindor truffles every since I became chronic (I have 2-3 per day)...guess they replaced my wine :-)",

HDL generally follows Total Cholesterol (TC), so it's to be expected that anything that raises TC will raise both LDL (the bad) and HDL (the good). More important are the ratios such as HDL to LDL. Unfortunately, the McDonalds diet does nothing to improve them, quite the opposite.-- Jim",
