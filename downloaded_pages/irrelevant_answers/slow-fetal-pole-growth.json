    "question": "We did IVF and should be 8 weeks and 2 days pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0First u/s at 7 weeks showed fetal pole development of 6 weeks with no h/b.\u00a0\u00a0Did another u/s week later, fetal pole at 2.5 mm (measuring at 5.5 weeks) with pulsing and slow heart beat. Dr. recommends waiting one more weeks to do another u/s before making any decisions but thinks there's is a strong chance of miscarriage due to the slow development. How accurate is the u/s in measuring the fetal pole...how could it go from 6 weeks to 5.5 weeks (both were done by different techs) I heard that sometimes the embyo may take longer to implant so that the dates could be off by a few days.\u00a0\u00a0Any similar experiences that turned out successfully or does it look like this pregancy is doomed?",
