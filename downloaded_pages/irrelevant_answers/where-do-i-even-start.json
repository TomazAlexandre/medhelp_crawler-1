            "answer": "It could be a number of things or a combination of things.Your pancreas not only helps to regulate blood sugar levels, it also plays a major role in digestion by secreting gastric juices to neutralize the high acidity of the chyme preparing it for nutrient absorption. Therefore, a problem with the pancreas could potentially cause your gastrointestinal symptoms as well as poor nutrient absorption which could be the cause of your vertigo, weak, tired feeling, slow healing but diabetes often causes the same type symptoms. Your frequent urination, thirst, and hunger is most likely from your diabetes. A endocrinologist would probably be the most helpful. Good luck!",

    "question": "I have had repeated doctors visits without much luck and I am at a loss in where I should even start when seeing specialists.I am a type 1 diabetic, so when I started experiencing strange glucose patterns, I started seeing my doctor for a potential solution. Over time it developed into something even more confusing. Whenever I ate, drank or even chewed gum I would burp or experience gas. This is the only symptom that has remained consistent. I have experienced strange sounds during and long after I ate like gurgling and clunking. My feet will also tingle and I will experience isolated coldness in my extremities.My entire body shape has also shifted. At first I lost about ten pounds in the matter of a week, then a month late I lost ten more. Then a month later I gained ten. It's hard to explain but the mass of my legs keep getting larger yet they have become less and less firm. Areas of my body have gotten larger in a short period of time, then shrunk down again with the exception of my legs. I am back down in my weight. Yet THAT is even hard to pin down because during the course of a day the scale goes from 160 to around 170 by bedtime. My skin has also become dryer along with my hair. My skin heals very, very slowly. I often feel thirsty. I have an increased production of mucous at the back of my throat. I feel intense vertigo whenever I stand. I generally feel weak and tired. My heart also beats fast all the time.Throughout these past few months I have experienced nausea after eating, constipation, random bouts of diarrhea, incontinence and frequent urination. I also get intense hunger pangs sometimes after eating.The strangest symptom of all is a wheezing in my lungs whenever I stand after laying down.If anyone has any kind of idea as to what this could even possibly be I will take anything. Even a specific kind of specialist I can go to. I am scared my primary doctor is just running around in circles at this point in an attempt to look like they have an answer. I am currently on a gluten free diet because that's really the only kind of direction I have to go. I did, however, test negative for celiac's.",
