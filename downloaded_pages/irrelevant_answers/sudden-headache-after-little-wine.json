    "question": "I have been able to consume wine without any problem - usually a glass with meals, have done for years, never over-doing it.....in the last couple of months though, I suffer from a severe pressure headache over the left eye after only a couple of mouthfuls of wine. It doesn't make any difference if it is red/white.There is plenty of info out there on allergies to suplites/preservatives etc and for people that have always had wine headache. I can not find anything about sudden onset of headaches after a number of years",
