            "answer": "Just because a doctor is an Endo does not mean a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Many of them specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Many others have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\" and only go by TSH, which doesn't work.\u00a0\u00a0Many others use \"Reference Range Endocrinology\", by which they will tell a patient that a test result that falls anywhere within the reference range is adequate.\u00a0\u00a0That is also wrong.A good thyroid doctor will treat a hypo patient clinically by testing and adjusting Free T3 and Free T4 as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief is what really matters to the patient, not just test results and especially not just TSH results.It is very unfortunate that the\u00a0\u00a0AACE (Amer. Association of CLINICAL Endocrinologists) doesn't really live up to its name and treat clinically, rather than as described above.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe they should consider a name change.\u00a0\u00a0LOL",

    "question": "My question is kinda long to give background hope not to long.I was found to have several goiters on both sides of my thyroid last year, because of me complaining of the being choked feeling.\u00a0\u00a0A TSH was normal at that time.\u00a0\u00a0That choking feeling has now returned and find it difficult to swallow solid foods.\u00a0\u00a0Again TSH, Free T3, and Free T4 were \"normal\". Seeing more and more of my scalp(hair loss), but nails fine, fatigue at least once a day to the point I feel like I am going to pass out.\u00a0\u00a0In this last year I have been diagnosed with GERD, Barrett's, Lichen Sclerosis, DDD, and gut issues.\u00a0\u00a0All being studied to be linked to auto immune.\u00a0\u00a0I find my symptoms to be worse in the evening with all.Any suggestions on what I should be doing or having done next?Tanya",
