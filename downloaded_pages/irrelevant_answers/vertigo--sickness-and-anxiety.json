            "answer": "Thank you for your reply!I am 18 years old. I've had problems with dizzyness in the past. From when I was 6 onwards I got dizzy spells teamed with a buzzing sensation in my head which paniced me, but they ended within minuites. I had tests done on my ears etc - they just put it down to stress. I don't know if this is related but when I was around 5 I fell down the stairs, hit my head and had to have a few stiches.I havent had those dizzy spells in a few months however this past week I have been suffering this. It is dizzyness, but as if I am on a boat... swaying from side to side. I have no energy and I'm basically lyeing down all the time. No ringing in the ear, but intense headaches and a nausea's feeling but I have not vomited. Also, completely lost my appetite. My boyfriend had glandular fever lately, I don't know if I may have got it.",

            "answer": "I suggest you see a Dr. or Nutritionist to help guide you in regards to both your vertigo and stress issues (may not be the same doctor).\u00a0\u00a0I firmly believe that stress can be a major trigger for hearing and vertigo problems, although it is obviously not the only cause.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, stress triggered a type-3 food allergy (IgG) which caused vertigo and hearing loss.\u00a0\u00a0 There are many OTC suppliments to help with stress, but it's best to get guidance from a professional before using the any food or chemical that affects your brain chemistry.",

            "answer": "Hi Amie635,The symptoms that you mentioned seem to look like Migraine with aura. Preceding headache there will be this feeling of dizziness. Migraine gets worsened during even small amount of stress. I would advise you to consult a neurologist as he will be the right person to help you out. Till then you can take tab cinnarizine, mild analgesics (paracetamol), antiemetics (like domperidone) and drink plenty of water.RegardsOHNS2010",

    "question": "I went to the doctor with those symptoms and he did no tests, he just said it was 'probably' a viral infection. He gave me Betahistine Dihydrochloride tablets to ease the dizzyness. However, I still feel uneasy and sick. It has been over a week now and I'm feeling anxious all the time. I start feeling literally terrified but I don't know why. I can't sleep alone because I get so scared. I'm starting to have panic attacks too.I need some info, like are these tablets any good, when I finish them will this go away? How do I get rid of this?",
