            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. If hemoglobin level is not too low, then the fatigue could be due to other causes such as hormonal imbalance of PCOD, diabetes, hypothyroidism, low vitamin D, low vitamin B12, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium.You must get the complete iron profile done. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "microcytic anemia x14 yrs following 2nd trimester miscarriage & hemorrhage, unresolved due to 10 years massive flooding periods following tubal ligation. (yes, I know..) anyways, TL reversal done 3 months ago, flooding periods have normalized. oral iron supplementing is 2 weeks on/ 2 weeks off not due to nuisance symptoms but full blown bowel obstruction symptoms. hgb 9-11. pao2 99% even though I live at 7000ft elevation possibly due to oxy/hemo differential (compensation)? severe, severe fatigue. I am beginning to feel as though there is a hierarchy of \"to whom the blood goes\" and as a menstruating female I am at the bottom. several years ago I had a male patient who while high on meth attempted a burglary but slipped off a roof & impaled himself on a fence. hgb=11; got 2 units. I had to sit down 3 times while dressing due to fatigue; what gives?",
