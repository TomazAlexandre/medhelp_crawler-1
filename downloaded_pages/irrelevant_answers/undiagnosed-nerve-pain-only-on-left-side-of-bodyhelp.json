            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The sensations of pins and tingling are generally due to peripheral neuropathies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism and diabetes. I know the last two have been looked into, but do get a thyroid antibody test too.Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis and G B Syndrome are two other possibilities. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Please read more about it on: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ParesthesiaPlease discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for your response!\u00a0\u00a0In regards to what you said about the tests I should have, I believe I have had them.\u00a0\u00a0So I decided to go dig up all my lab results from the past year.\u00a0\u00a0I'll list them out and let me know if you see any tests they should have done.The following tests were done in August 2007 (all deemed normal)-Lyme screen/No reflux: Neg-RBC sed rate, non automated: 9-ANA screen: Neg-CK total: 43The following tests were done in September 2008 (all deemed normal)-TSH: 2.87-B12: 489-C-ANCA proteinase-3AB\u00a0\u00a0<3.0-P-ANCA myeloperoxidase <3.00-sed rate AB: 6-Thyrperoxidase ABY: 12.8-T4, free: 1.2-Full CBC and differential:\u00a0\u00a0all within rangeIn addition to these I had MRI with and without contrast and nerve conductivity tests done on both arm and leg.....normal results with these as well.My doc just basically said that they are hundreds of nerve disorders and 70% are never diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0So then we tried the rounds of nerve blocking medicine (Lyrica, neurontin, amytriptiline)\u00a0\u00a0all of which had horrible side effects.\u00a0\u00a0I felt like I was having a heart attack on Lyrica!\u00a0\u00a0I'm stumped here and in pain.\u00a0\u00a0Currently my ankle feels like \"someone poking at a bruise\"\u00a0\u00a0I know that sounds weird, but thats my best description.\u00a0\u00a0I also can't keep that foot straight.\u00a0\u00a0When I walk my foot turns inward, causing me to trip constantly.If you have any other thoughts on my condition or tests that I should take let me know.\u00a0\u00a0Any help would be great!",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!Based on further information provided by you, it appears that you probably have excessive pronation of foot. Pronation is the normal movement that allows the foot to adapt to uneven walking surfaces and to absorb shock. Excessive pronation occurs when the foot has a tendency to turn inward and stretch and pull the fascia along with it. This also causes heel pain, and because of the posture pain is also felt in hip, knee, and lower back. This can explain excessive pain on your left side.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. You can consult an orthopedic specialist. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor (PCP) and get a referral for a sports clinic and consult a sports medicine specialist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I m a 32 year old female who has been experiencing what I assume is nerve pain only on my left side for about 6 years now.\u00a0\u00a0It all started about 6 years ago when I was diagnosed with Herpes and I would get these horrible electric shock pains in the back of my left thigh...the doc told me that was a prodrome to the virus.\u00a0\u00a0Well I believed him and since it was only happening about once or twice a year for a couple a days I didnt think too much.\u00a0\u00a06 years later I am having horrible \"electric\" pain everywhere on my left side.\u00a0\u00a0Episodes now last 8 weeks and occur about every 2-3 months.\u00a0\u00a0It is most severe in my left hand, wrist and forearm, back of thigh, heel, and ankle.\u00a0\u00a0It always starts off as just pins and needles feeling, to numbness, horrible burning, feeling of ice going through veins, and electric shock feeling.\u00a0\u00a0These \"electric shocks\" will literally knock me off my feet. It eventually gets to the point where I cant pick anything up with my left hand or balance on left foot.Been to the docs more recently and they are stumped.\u00a0\u00a0Tests I have had that of course \"all come back normal\" grrr:-MRI of brian and neck, nerve conductivity tests in both arm and leg, blood tests for lupus, ms, etc, thyroid test, B12 test, and no I dont have diabetes.In keeping with the theme of nerve problems, I have had others in the past.\u00a0\u00a0I had a TIA (mild stroke) in 2005...docs baffled as to why,\u00a0\u00a0and I have optic nerve damage due to pigment dispersion syndrome. Other symptoms I have but am unsure if related to this same problem are:-dizziness/vertigo (always feling like i am dropping in an elevator), skin problems-weird rashes, hypersensativity to the sun (break out in major hives), occasional \"foggyness\" like how I felt after my stroke, recurring infections, especially yeast and bladder (ugh).\u00a0\u00a0i was also just diagnosed with endometriosis after a surgery removing some ovarian cysts.Sorry this is so long but it's hard to cover 6 years in a blog!\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has had anything similar or can offer some advice it would be greatly appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0I am just scared that since this has progressed so much that one day my left side will hurt 24/7/365. I can only hope not or find a cure!\u00a0\u00a0thanks",
