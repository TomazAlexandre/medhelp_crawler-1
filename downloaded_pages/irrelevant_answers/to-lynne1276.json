            "answer": "Yeah I was dreading drinking that nasty stuff. I honestly don't think there is twins unless one is hiding the other Very very well. I've had more u/s' then most ppl have in their entire pregnancy. So I'd have imagined they would have seen it by now, but ya never know doctors arent perfect and anythings possible I suppose. I'm sure there is a explanation, but I'm not sure what it is or If I'm going to like it. I've got my own theories, but I think they should be answered next Tuesday.",

    "question": "I know I don't have gestational diabetes. My doctor didn't want to put me thru the 1hr test so he just ordered me a glucometer and I check my blood sugar 3 times a day and it's been wonderful. They haven't said much about anything yet. I haven't had my big scan yet, but will on Tuesday and will definitely keep you posted. I'm sure all these things are going to be brought up then. I'm just so curious I guess as to why I have extra fluid and why my uterus is much larger then it should be. hmmm I dunno what to think anymore.",
