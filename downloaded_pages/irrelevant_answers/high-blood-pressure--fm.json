            "answer": "Well about 2 years ago I started watching what I was eating & cut out all junk. I lost 50 lbs in 1 year. Since October when my FM came back to haunt me I have gained that 50 lbs back. I am a stress eater. And you hit them both on the head I am also a smoker. I have cut back about 1/2 of what I use to smoke since my doc put me off of work. My mother in law is visiting right now & she smokes like a chimney, I will give it a whirl at quitting when she leaves at the end of the month.Thanks,Val",

            "answer": "Hey, VAlME/CFS and FMS are similair but definately NOT the same thing, I have to beg to differ with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0In fact there's a research paper out about just that.\u00a0\u00a0If you need the link, I'll message it to you.In general,\u00a0\u00a0ME/CFS and FMS tend to have low blood pressure, but it is not exclusive.I had very low blood pressure all my life\u00a0\u00a0and it shot up since 3 years ago after dental extraction surgeries.Sometimes, bp can be hereditary too regardless.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on very low dose of Atenolol right now...at times, I cut it in half as bp medicine does have undesired side affects.Have a good day.Kit",

    "question": "Well\u00a0\u00a0I went to the doc yesterday & the specialist said I have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome & FM. I mentioned that to my Family Doctor & he said CFS & FM are the same thing? I think he is wrong, is he? Also I know have HBP does that go with CFS & FM? It wasn't real high it was just on the border line 140/90 so he put me on pills for that. Is there anything else I can do to lower it?Thanking you in advance for all the responses.Val",
