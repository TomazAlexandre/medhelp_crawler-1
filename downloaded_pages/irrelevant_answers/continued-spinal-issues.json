            "answer": "Straightening of the normal cervical lordosis is a physiological body response to chronic neck pain and is not really an injury. Likewise congenital straightening of the spinal canal you were born with.I cannot really say whether surgery is reccommended or not without seeing your scans. Just flattening of the spinal cord does not mean necessarily that there is spinal cord damage or that surgery is necessary - you need to be careful that your symtpoms are actually caused directly by the disk herniation and no another type of soft tissue injury. Otherwise the surgery may not be successful. This a a clinical decsion that can be made by your neurologists or neurosurgeon.Twitches throughout the body are common, and usually are benign - they can also be caused by pinched nerves, exposure to cold, excercise or certain medications or viral illnesses. Very rarely and only associated with muscle weakness and wasting are they associated with ALS.",

            "answer": "(Continued)The tonic water did not help. I also have started with a tremor in my left hand that only happens occasionally. Sometimes it shakes so much that I can't hold anything in it. I also have chronic headaches but I don't believe that they are all migraines. I have pitting edema in both legs & feet. I am also starting to have problems with my bowels and was put on prescribed laxatives by my primary doctor. I am only having a bowel movement once a week. Also when I cough, I now feel pressure on my bowels instead of bladder.My question is, Could these new symptoms be related to my spinal issue's or could they be symptoms of yet another problem? I am sorry that this was so long, but I believe that you would need my past & present medical history to help me. Again I thank you so very much.Jeanne",

    "question": "Hello Doctor,First let me start by saying, \"Thank You for donating your valuable time to this forum.\"I am a 40 year old female with many spinal issue's. I had a lumbar fusion with Infuse & Laminectomy & Discectomy on L4,L5,S1 June 2003. This surgery left me with chronic pain in both back and legs. Also most recent MRI stated that both disc's have again herniated along with much scar tissue. I also have cervical injury's such as: Straightening of the Normal Cervical Lordosis. Mild Congenital Narrowing of the Spinal Canal, C4-5, C5-6, C6-7 Herniated Discs &C4-5 & C5-6 , Cord Flattening at these levels. My cervical injury's were caused from diving in my pool and slamming my head on the bottom. Cervical Fusion has been recommended to me, but I am to afraid of the surgery leaving me in more pain because of past experience.Also in the last two years I have been medically diagnosed with the following: Bilateral Chronic L4 versus L5 Radiculopathy, Bilateral Frozen Shoulder - (MUA 2/7/05) Tendonitis & Tendinosis of both shoulders, Fibromyalgia, Arthritis & Bursitis of bilateral hips, Urinary Stress Incontinence, Type ll Diabetes, Anemia, Acid Reflux, Migraine's, Sleep Apnea & Polyneuropathy. Needless to say I am not the healthiest individual.In the past couple of months I have developed new symptoms. I have a tremor in my jaw only when lying down. This happens every night. I also have had some twitches throughout my body such as foot, leg, arms and only once in my abdomen. I tired drinking tonic water before bed as instructed by my neurologist but only for 2 nights.",
