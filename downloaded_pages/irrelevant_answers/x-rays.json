            "answer": "I am the retired school teacher in NYC who corresponded with you on this website back in May 2008. At the time I was concerned that a dental x-ray (realized recently that I also had a CAT scan for a stress test near that time) had caused a white spot deep in the pupil of my left eye. You assured me that this was not the cause.Anyway, that white blotch is still there and that eye always seems to be dry and irritated and the vision has changed from -3.75 diopters gradually down to -2.00 diopters and that even seems to now be incorrect.Does this seem to be a progressing cataract? The white spot has not grown. I am even tempted to fly top KC and make an appointment to see you. Do you have any recommendations for a competent colleague eye specialist here in NYC? I was seeing one but his office gradually became a clinic----minimum 3 hour wait on any visit.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again,\u00a0\u00a0Joe Mapelli (Henry4375 on Med Help)\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0***@****",

    "question": "Went to a dentist last year for a second opinion. He seemed to have his old fashioned x-ray machine pointed directly at my left eye. A few days later I noticed a white blotch on that eye when I looked in the mirror. Went to an opthamologist. He confirmed it was a cataract \"on the outside of the lens\" unlike what he said was a usual one inside a lens but refused to speculate on the cause. Just for my own peace of mind, is there any way the dental x-ray could hace caused this?",
