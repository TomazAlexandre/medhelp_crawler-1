            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.You should be able to continue with the metformin as long as your sugars remain well controlled. As your pregnancy progresses, however, you may find that your sugars are more volatile and cannot be controlled without insulin. It is important for your health and that of your baby that your blood sugar remains controlled.I would recommend that you monitor your sugars and keep your doctors informed so that they can help you manage your diabetes as your pregnancy progresses.Congratulations on your pregnancy!Cathy",
