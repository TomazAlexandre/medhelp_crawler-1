            "answer": "She will just have to be extra careful with her diet as the baby can get alot of sugar and may become big I had gd but was controlled by diet my babies were born early at 38 weeks but werent too big. A lady in my town just had twins by c section at 37 weeks they weighed 8lb 11oz and 9lb 4oz she is a little lady but has the type 1 diabetes which caused her babies to be so big. She will just have to have special care and be closely monitored through out her pregnancy.",

            "answer": "My mom has juvenile diabetes (type 1). She was diagnosed when she was 2 years old and has taken insulin since. She had five healthy kids. My mom is very small (5'2\" tall and only around 100-125 lbs) and all of us were big. She had two of us by cesarean and three of us natural. One of my sisters was a preemie and she weighed just over 7 lbs but the rest of us were between 8.5 and 10 lbs. I think the biggest concern of doctors is the size of the baby. That seems to be the only complication my mom had with all of us. The doctors will keep a close eye on your sister to make sure everything is okay.",
