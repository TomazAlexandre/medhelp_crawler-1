            "answer": "If you are saying that possibly you have had asthma from birth which would be one of the most common issues of respiratory issues w. children then yes the blood pressure is definately effected by that.\u00a0\u00a0If your blood pressure is in the 140 and over range it needs to be dealt with by your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0That is way too high for someone in your age group and hopefully they have told you how to modify your diet or at the very least have you on blood pressure medicine.........good luck",

            "answer": "Actually, above 120/80 is now considered too high by the medical copmmunity and should be treated...prior a metric 120-139 and 80-to 89 was considered pre-hypertension and just watched. Your question relates system blood pressureSalt sensitivity?Studies indicate that there is some association between a person's blood pressure and WEAK respiratory muscles from birth. Respiration in the lungs has a definite influence over the creation of pressure in blood vessels and the oxygen delivered during the respiratory cycle affect the receptors in the body regions. This means the rate of respiration may be influenced by changing blood pressures. The etiology can be explained with further detail!Also, there is\u00a0\u00a0possibility blood vessels do not function very well with diabetes, or history of diabetes as diabetes can have a damaging effect on the endothelium cells.\u00a0\u00a0Endothelium cells line the blood vessels and act and function as a monitor to the system's nerve center.\u00a0\u00a0For example, when the blood flow is reduced (i.e. low cardiac output or loss of blood...unable to distinquish between the two)) the endothelium cells signal the nerve center to constrict blood vessels, signal kidneys to increase blood volume, increase heart rate, etc. We know diabetes is vessel disease.AHA source if interested more detail: \"Hypertension is a major factor that contributes to the development of the vascular complications of diabetes mellitus, which primarily include atherosclerosis, nephropathy, and retinopathy. The mechanism of the pathophysiological effects of hypertension lies at the cellular level in the blood vessel wall, which intimately involves the function and interaction of the endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells. Both hypertension and diabetes mellitus alter endothelial cell structure and function. In large and medium size vessels and in the kidney, endothelial dysfunction leads to enhanced growth and vasoconstriction of vascular smooth muscle cells and mesangial cells, respectively. These changes in the cells of smooth muscle lineage play a key role in the development of both atherosclerosis and glomerulosclerosis. In diabetic retinopathy, damage and altered growth of retinal capillary endothelial cells is the major pathophysiological insult leading to proliferative lesions of the retina. Thus, the endothelium emerges as a key target organ of damage in diabetes mellitus; this damage is enhanced in the presence of hypertension. An overall approach to the understanding and treatment of diabetes mellitus and its complications will be to elucidate the mechanisms of vascular disease and endothelial cell dysfunction that occur in the setting of hypertension and diabetes\".Hope this provides some insight and a perspective that may help explain the possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0Also, there are unexplained causation for hypertension. Thanks for your question with HD, and if you have any further questions or comments you are welcome to reapondRegards.",

    "question": "hi i am 22 years male..my weight is 44 kgBut i am surprised of my blood pressure..It is always above 140..I thought that was due to diabetes or any heart problem so i checked my blood sugar and did echocardiogram 2 times..But everything was good..I was doubt for kidney problem and did ultrasound but the report was normal..None of the tests had found my abnormalities...But i have a respiratory problem from my very birth..so is it due to this??????",
