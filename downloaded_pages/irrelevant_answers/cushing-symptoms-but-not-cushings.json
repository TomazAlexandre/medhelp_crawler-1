            "answer": "Goodness Sakes.....This is a tough one!\u00a0\u00a0 Welcome to the forum...Are you sure this isn't CHF (Congestive Heart Failure)? That is my first thought....Has Heartworm Disease & Tick Born Diseases been ruled out? It sounds as if your Vet is just guessing.....After these, I would go with Asthma/Bronchitis that can be managed with Bronchodilators which are inhaled steroids, but do not effect the rest of the body......This condition does cause an enlarged Heart, that presses on the lungs...However, the Pot belly IMO would not come into play....The gagging while drinking can be a Collapsing Trachea or Asthma (Above).....I don't seem to be much help...Maybe someone else will come along w/info. for you......If you have any more details, it might help......I assume a complete blood panel has been run, correct? How did it look?Anything thing point to any diseases......And last: Canine Diabetes could be your culprit....It causes most of the symptoms you describe & is quite common..........Has that been checked?\u00a0\u00a0Let me know, Karla",

            "answer": "Karla has given a bunch of Great Possibilities, but she has forgotten to mention one, that I would like to add to her list, as well as suggest.Please have your poodle checked for possible hypothyroid.Poodles are prone to this condition, and, It could be the reason for every symptom you have described.I had a boxer with many of the same problems, and it turned out she was hypothyroid.The test requires simple blood work. Be sure the vet tests T3, T4, and Free T4 levels.Low thyroid levels will affect the larynx, and would explain the snoring, as well as gagging and coughing.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a change in the way her bark sounds?Low thyroid levels would also explain the allergies, panting, incontinence,heart, and adrenal issues.My boxer did have a pot belly as well.While I am not sure if hypothyroid affects the liver, I do know that an enlarged liver could be the reason for the pot belly.Hopefully your vet has already checked for kidney function and diabetes.Best Wishes to you and your pooch.Connie",
