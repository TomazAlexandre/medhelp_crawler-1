            "answer": "Usually when parents post complaints about their child's limited diet,\u00a0\u00a0it seems that the diet seems fine - there are a lot of nutritious items,\u00a0\u00a0it's just a very short list.His diet seems unacceptable.\u00a0\u00a0I never say this,\u00a0\u00a0but I think you need to stop giving him access to several of these things,\u00a0\u00a0and you can substitute other like things.\u00a0\u00a0He won't starve to death - he'll eat the other things.\u00a0\u00a0Really,\u00a0\u00a0I NEVER say this kind of thing,\u00a0\u00a0because usually the diets are minimally okay.How about chicken nuggets, home made sweet potato fries,\u00a0\u00a0 healthy coco puff type cereal (the kind you get in a whole foods store)\u00a0\u00a0and homemade ranger cookies?\u00a0\u00a0I would limit him to a soda a day and then give him interesting flavored water that he can choose the flavors and mix them himself.\u00a0\u00a0Fun.Holding out \"over night\" is probably something he'll do - and maybe hold out the next day,\u00a0\u00a0but he will eat eventually,\u00a0\u00a0and it's not like you're making him eat something disgusting to him,\u00a0\u00a0just healthier variations on what he is already willing to eat.Search the net for a Ranger cookie recipe that looks good - they're packed with oatmeal and other good stuff,\u00a0\u00a0and you can toss in chocolate chips if you think that will entice him.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0well.\u00a0\u00a0I've got a picky eater myself. But the thing about your boys diet is that it is all things you have bought for him and let him have at one time or another and now he has decided that it is all he will eat.\u00a0\u00a0Don't go through the drive through, don't buy diet pop, don't buy cocoa puffs.\u00a0\u00a0You'll have the items in your home that he can choose from and I'd just keep them healthier.\u00a0\u00a0No one has actually starved themselves holding out for cocoa puffs.\u00a0\u00a0Fear not that this will happen.My boy has various issues and he is\u00a0\u00a0not a fan of vegis.\u00a0\u00a0So, I cook them up and slip them in various things like spaghetti sauce.\u00a0\u00a0I also make a smoothie with carrot juice and spinach (which they can't taste at all)--- it is mixed with fruit that is frozen and a touch of cinnoman and a banana.But I just think you have to change the dynamics of the household and what is there for him to choose from.\u00a0\u00a0I guess everyone will have to suffer with no sugary cereal but that' okay-----\u00a0\u00a0everyone will live.Just my opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "My 7 year old son does not eat anything other than McDonald's french fries, diet caffeine free coke, occassionally coco puffs, goldfish, and cookies.\u00a0\u00a0He stopped drinking milk, juice, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He does not eat any other fruit, vegetables, etc.The doctors have suggested that there is no problem.\u00a0\u00a0However, his BMI is on the lower side.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, we cannot try to introduce foods to him.\u00a0\u00a0He utterly refuses, emotionally shuts down, when the subject of food is approached and he will not even look at a new type of food.\u00a0\u00a0He will hold out over night if his foods are removed, and will not break down and eat something else instead.\u00a0\u00a0I do give him a daily vitamin, which luckily he will take, but it is very distressing to know that my child refuses to eat anything other than fried and sugary food (and very little variety within that category -- fries and cookies basically).\u00a0\u00a0How can I get him to discuss food, to consider it, to change his thinking about it?\u00a0\u00a0He has been this way for 5 years now.This discussion is related to/posts/show/275585.",
