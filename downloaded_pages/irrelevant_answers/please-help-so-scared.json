    "question": "Hello , I am 28 years old woman , I had unprotected vaginal and oral sex with someone with unknown HIV status (so stupid of me) . The incident happened in the first days of March 2014 ( I cannot recall the exact date). After a couple of week I got sick with sore throat , swollen neck glands and up to 38 body temperature , also some body aches. That stayed for a week and then went away. I decided to get tested so I had antibodies HIV test on 4th of July 2014 which came negative . Lately I have some body aches especially on my back and under my ribs that come and go . I also have diabetes type 1. My questions are : Is my test conclusive after almost 3 months of the incident ? As a diabetic could it take more for antibodies to appear ? Do I need to retest ? I am so scared , so stressed that it interferes with daily activities , I cannot concentrate on anything .. I am lost .. Please help! Your answer is appreciated ! Thank you in advance , Maya .",
