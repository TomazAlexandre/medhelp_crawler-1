            "answer": "Hello,the nurse is wrong!\u00a0\u00a0In order to control your diabetes you need to know what your blood sugar is doing.\u00a0\u00a0So you need to buy a meter and test strips.\u00a0\u00a0there are cheaper brands.\u00a0\u00a0Then you test your fasting (ideally it is < 95), and you test 1 1/2 to 2 hrs after eating and ideally it is < 140, or even better < 120.Then you use this information to adjust your diet so you can find foods that don't make your sugars go too high (usually carbs are the problem), and to see the effect of exercise on your blood sugar (ie. you may find that 30 minutes walk after each meal goes a long way to giving better control).Do you know your Hba1c?\u00a0\u00a0can you share if you do?",

They seem to be the one who dictate what happens and my treatment.I am also under the consultants at the hospital for my skin problems and my prolific retinopathy (I am now registered partially sighted) and I have to say they have been outstanding. It is my doctors surgery where I feel that I am just another patient taking up time although I only attend when they say and never phone or go at any other time.",
