            "answer": "Hello,This condition is known as Postural Hypotension, it has no relation to a neck problem. This basically is a drop in blood pressure that occurs when a person assumes a standing or upright position, usually after a prolonged period of rest but not always. This occurs as a normal physiological function but can affect some people more then others, this is the most likely diagnosis. In addition it could indicate overuse of particular drugs such as MAOI's and/or particular diseases such as diabetes.RegardsDr Foot",

He also said to take a daily vitamin - that way your body is receiving some of the vitamins that you may miss in your daily food consumption.....\u00a0\u00a0I've been good since!!\u00a0\u00a0But as Dr. Foot said.... it could be something a little more serious.... check it out with your doctor.",
