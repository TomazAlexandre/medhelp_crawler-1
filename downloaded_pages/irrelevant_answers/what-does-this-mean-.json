            "answer": "Thank you both for responding , i did get a ct scan , i think he did abdominal scan too see if i had kidney stones, or cysts on my ovaries\u00a0\u00a0which he said the only thing he saw was a 2 cm cyst on my right ovary which ive had that cyst for yrs and it was 1cm when i first found out about it .when i went to my doc last wk i told him about the lump ,so he felt it , and he asked me if i was doing any crunches or anything i said no i dont really do any exercises , he said feels like\u00a0\u00a0cartilage buildup , so he did some snap crackle , pop on my back to see if that was the problem , and pushed my lower ribs back into place, but it didnt help , he prescribed me flexeril , it doesnt even touch it , it made the soreness that he did go away but i still feel the pain and tenderness coming from that lump in the front ,side and back basically between the hip and lower base of the ribs !I told him about my mom having diabetes and both her parents having it , and if i should be tested often to make sure , he said yes and after that he slipped in can i test u for high cholesteral , i said sure\u00a0\u00a0why not. so he left the room with my chart and was on the phone with a cardioligst so he stopped me before i went for my blood work and asked do u mind if i prescribe you flexaril , and i said sure why not.Anyways the reason for ct scan was because i am having alot of UTI'S\u00a0\u00a0inthe last 10 yrs , and there was blood in my urine ,and i told him about the pains on my left side ,so he wanted to see if i had any stones or cysts maybe causing it , but he found nothing ! except the 2cm cyst on my right ovary\u00a0\u00a0which he said wouldnt cause all the pain on the left side !All i know this is getting annoying ,when i sit i feel like i have a ball of some sort on my ribs ,when i cough my side and back hurts , or if i turn i cant turn all the way . i just dont get it if this is some sort of cartilige build up then why does it hurt , why do i have soreness between my hip and waist line , and i also sometimes get the feeling like stitches inside like that prickly pain feeling !i know i can go on and on about this and get no where with it !again thank you all for responding !",
