            "answer": "How small? Are they worried? I'm 37 weeks and I have gestational diabetes and we were worried I would have a \"fat\" baby because he may be exposed to excess sugars, but he is actually measuring about 6lbs 6oz, which they said is about \"5 days\" behind. I started out at 218 when I got pregnant and I am currently 213 and my doctor seems happy with this. I don't vomit much but my stomach is upset a lot. Also my first son was 8lbs 14oz, babies can be healthy in a variety of sizes, if your doctor isn't worried, you have no need to be.",
