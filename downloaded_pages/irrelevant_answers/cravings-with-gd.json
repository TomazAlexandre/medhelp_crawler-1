            "answer": "I had it with my first and I always wanted watermelon so with my meal I would have watermelon as my carb and have it equal my total carb limit and I would eat meat and veggoes to fill me up. Every now and then I would go to cherry berry and get some frozen yogurt as a special treat. I was, like you, very restrictive on the diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0My girl can out 6lbs 7.9oz. So nice and small even though I figured out a way to work around my constant watermelon craving. And I'm happy to say I don't have it with this pregnancy so there is hope if you wind up pregnant again that you may not have it.",

    "question": "So I have this darned gestational diabetes and I'm on the diet and exercise plan without medication and I've posted about it before how I constantly feel like I'm starving due to the restrictions on what I can/can't eat. Well at 36+2 I'm having cravings that are super bad! I've had them the last month and a half and never over indulged but now I'm craving everything I can't have and I just don't know how to deal with it anymore! Mainly because I also have IBS (irritable bowel syndrome) so certain things upset my stomach and now everything I eat that I consider an indulgence (had a super small serving of lasagna last week and had tacos last night with the shells you fry up a little in the pan first) upset my stomach an at the end of the day, I still have that starving feeling and I'm craving something else. Anyone have tips on dealing with cravings while on a restrictive diet for gestational diabetes?",
