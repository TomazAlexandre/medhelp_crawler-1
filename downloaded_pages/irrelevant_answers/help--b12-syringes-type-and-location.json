    "question": "I bought a vial of the B12 and am in need of advice. Should I be combining the shot with B6? And I am also quite confused about the type of syringe and the location of the injection? Should we be using the longer syringes intramuscularly or the shallower diabetes needles injected into a fatty spot? I am also curious about combining this cocktail with ephedra or phentermine? All advice would be appreciated.Many thanks--TorontoGirl",
