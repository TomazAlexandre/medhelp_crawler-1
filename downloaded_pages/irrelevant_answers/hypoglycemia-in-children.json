            "answer": "Yes, it is possible to \"outgrow\" hypoglycemia. Or so I was told.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with hypoglycemia when I was about 4 and told I had \"outgrown\" it when I was about 9.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure if it was because of the hypoglycemia or because of family history, but I was an overweight child when I was diagnosed and remained that way.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 22 and was just recently diagnosed with it again.\u00a0\u00a0Though I have had symptoms for YEARS.\u00a0\u00a0but the doctors never did the right 3 hour glycerin test.\u00a0\u00a0They only did the fasting sugar test.\u00a0\u00a0If your child is ever told they have outgrown it be sure to watch out for signs of relapsing into it.\u00a0\u00a0I also have the same trouble finding information such as recipes etc for hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0What my doctor says I can eat and what I cannot eat is a lot different than what the sites say diabetics can eat.\u00a0\u00a0She basically told me to check for anything that has malitol, dextrol, anything ending \"ol\" bc its just another name for sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I eat sugar free bread, apples, strawberries in moderation for a sweet fix.\u00a0\u00a0Your child will eventually outgrow a sweet tooth as not having those foods will help them not crave it.\u00a0\u00a0It is a trial and error process to see what foods boost energy and what foods seem to not help as much.\u00a0\u00a0also make sure they eat every 3-4 hours to keep those levels balanced and steady.\u00a0\u00a0it is hard and is a pain!\u00a0\u00a0My doctor told me that I can control it by my food intake and will probably always have it but if I eat right and no sugar, odds are I wont become a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0If you have any questions just post them I'd be happy to share ideas!",

    "question": "My 7-year-old daughter was recently diagnosed with hypoglycemia. Everytime I look up info on the web, I am taken to a diabetes website. She has not been diagnosed with diabetes. What are her chances of becoming diabetic? Her doctor said hypoglycemia sometimes precedes diabetes in children. Is is possible to \"grow out of\" hypoglycemia? If so, what are the chances of this happening?",
