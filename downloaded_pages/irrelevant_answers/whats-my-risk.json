    "question": "about 45 days ago, received unprotected oral briefly from an escort.\u00a0\u00a0Lasted less than 30 seconds because i made her stop.\u00a0\u00a0No other sexual activity. I don't believe she went far enough to call it deep throat.\u00a0\u00a0I had a change of heart and left.\u00a0\u00a0about 3 days ago, started feeling soreness in either the groin or testicle area.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot tell exactly where it is coming from.\u00a0\u00a0There is no painful urination, no discharge.\u00a0\u00a0The soreness occurs mostly when I am sitting and mostly disappears when I am standing.\u00a0\u00a0I have a history of prostate enlargement and have to frequently get up at night to pee.\u00a0\u00a0I am also a trucker that sits a lot.\u00a0\u00a0 I\u00a0\u00a0don't know if my pain in the groin/testicles is associated with the prostate issue, the sitting issue or with the episode several weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0Haven't had my sugar checked in awhile either so not sure if frequent urination is due to prostate or onset of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow,\u00a0\u00a0with the absence of painful urination or discharge, how likely is my painful groin/testicles attributed to an STD?",
