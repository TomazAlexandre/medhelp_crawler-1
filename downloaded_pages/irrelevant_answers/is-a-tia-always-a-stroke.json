            "answer": "Hi,How are you? A transient ischaemic attack (TIA) often called a mini stroke, happens when the brain\u2019s blood supply is interrupted for a very brief time. The symptoms are very similar to a stroke (such as weakness on one side of the body, loss of sight and slurred speech) but they are temporary, lasting a few minutes or hours, and then disappearing completely within 24 hours. A TIA is a sign that part of the brain is not getting enough blood and that there is a risk of a more serious stroke in the future.The risk factors for stroke are: The chance of having a stroke approximately doubles for each decade of life after age 55, heredity, race, gender, history of previous TIA or stroke, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, poor physical activity, poor diet, hyperlipidemia etc.I would suggest that you visit a urologist and rule out all the risk factors listed above and take appropriate treatment.Best.",

            "answer": "How does one know if they have had a mini-stroke especially if their Doctor is not willing to do further tests? What tests of the head or brain are available to determine this ? Do tell, please, as my Doctor says there is nothing I can do but live with the attacks which I have now had 4 of in just over a week ! He seems to think they are just Migraine Variants but they really present like a min-stoke and my family thinks s too.Ta, K.",

    "question": "I had a TIA 4 days ago, momentry loss of vision, unable to speak, sweating etc. I had tight feeling on left side of face and still have wasted feeling to left arm.I had severe pain in muscles in front left of chest across colar bone area to left shoulder. These began the day before and though severe they have gone suddenly today. I thought that I had pulled a muscle and it wasn't related to the TIA but am now not so sure since it just dissapeared so quickly today as muscle/ligament damage takes ages to heal.Heart, CT and carrotid ultrasound have all tested clear. The puzzle is that I don't have any of the risk factors. I'm 61, low blood pressure, no cholesterol, low weight, non smoker and well exercised. I will be having an MRI next week but\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if there are other conditions than the normal stroke risk factors that can lead to these events. I am aware of the link with migraines, are there any other possibilities we should be looking at?Thanks.",
