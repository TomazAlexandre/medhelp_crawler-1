            "answer": "Sounds like she needs seen by peds endo, the elevated tsh needs repeated and with an enlarged thyroid her antibodies may now be measureable perhaps before not high enough. She sounds like she has subclinical hypothyroidism, now this alone is not to blame for her weight gain, there are many many other factors, I know you have seen a dietician but seriously look at her diet, take away any sugared drinks including juice, increase her daily exercise to something a little longer and more enjoyable so she can stay compliant. Look at what she is eating at school lunch and if she is having school breakfast and address what the family is eating overall. Is there strong family history of diabetes or obesity in the family. She is around the prepubertal age that she is definitely prone towards insulin resistance. So work with your ped to get a referral and see how they can help you and your daughter.",

            "answer": "I guess elevated TSH and normal T4 typically signifies a problem with the thyroid gland. However, my 5 year old (almost 6) son also had slightly elevated platelets(440) on top of the slightly elevated TSH count(5.5). He slso suffered a severe traumatic brain injury with asubarachnoid hemorrhage and bleeding from the hypothalmus, after a TV fell on him, almost 4years ago.He miraculously survived by the graceof God, with no brain damage, as his soft spothad not completely closed. He temporarily had mild diabetes insephidis, and completely recovered with minimal therapy within a couple of months.When we left the hospital, they told us to watch closely for hormonal changes, which prompted the numerous blood tests when I said something to my doctor about 3 months ago. The TSH slightly increases every time there is a lab. I know this is rare, but could this be signsof a damaged hypothalamus or scar tissue or something, not just a thyroid problem? Did anyone's doctor run a scan on the head or do most just treat with levothyroxine?Theyare waiting on next labs to determine his medication dose.Any insight would be great, as I am concerned with other problems with his brain, but thyroid issues and autoimmune problems do run in the family",

    "question": "I'm a bit confused.\u00a0\u00a0My 10 yr old daughter just had blood work done and it showed an elevated tsh level 0f 6.5(normal up to 5.5) so slightly elevated-t3 and t4 are within normal range and thyroid antibodied are normal as well-cotisol was\u00a0\u00a0normal too.\u00a0\u00a0An ultrasound of her thyroid revealed that it is enlarged-one side is also bigger than the other and she also presents a multinodlar goiter.\u00a0\u00a0I'm assuming that with normal antibodies(thyroid) that this is not autoimmune.\u00a0\u00a0What could cause this-I've done some research online, but nothing similar to this.\u00a0\u00a0Also her pelvis ultrasound looked normal.\u00a0\u00a0She is only 10 and 4'11 and weighs 150 lbs!!!!! 50 lbs gained in the past 1 1/2.\u00a0\u00a0We have been to a dietician, so she is eating healthy, taking in low calories and excercising almost daily.\u00a0\u00a0Could her thyroid be the cause of this?\u00a0\u00a0She also started having reallyy bad dandruff, itchy, moody, grades have slightly dropped.\u00a0\u00a0She is just different lately and I'm a little perplexed by all of this.\u00a0\u00a0Has an endo appoinment in late February and her general prac. has started her on a low dose of levothyroxine.",
