    "question": "My endo. did an ultrasound of my thyroid in her office. Except of \"no blood flow\" she said it looked normal so the \"problems\" must be coming from the pituitary\". I tried asking questions about what could be wrong, etc. however, she said \"we would probably never know\" &that it would probably \"never change or improve\". I also have problems with Addisons, repeatedly high PTH labs, Diabetes now, low VitD, 1MRI\u00a0\u00a0saying I had Empty Sella but have had normal MRIs since&also a few other abnormal ENDO. labs. Should I be satisfied with this answer regarding the pituitary and thyroid? Are all these problems related? They have all come up within the last 3 years or so.\u00a0\u00a0My PCP has sent me to three different ENDOs and recently even to the Mayo Clinic where the ENDO felt I had too many \"rare things wrong for them to all be true\" so he \"didn't believe any of them\". I also have Ehlers Danlos.Help plz. Have no $ for more docs as my health is going downhill and the costs are rising! Thank you so much for any health or direction. I am so exhausted all the time now and am in chronic pain from the Ehlers Danlos.",
