            "answer": "Hello,Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. . Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle.Pls keep the area clean and apply warm compresses and some topical antiseptics. Also wear loose-fitting cotton clothing and use an antibacterial soap or mild soap like dove.Avoid any kind of cosmetics. Topical antibiotics such as mupirocin or neomycin containing ointment are also useful.In case the symptoms persist then oral antibiotics may be needed.You can also take oral anti inflammatory pain killers and try avoiding close contact with children.Also if the symptom persists then incision and drainage may be required.Pls consult your doctor in that case. Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders.So pls get your blood sugar evaluated.Hope it helps.Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I have boils on my stomach.I had a previous outbreak a couple of months ago.I popped those and they spread even worse over my upper right side of my body.I went to the doctor and was told that it was a staph infection.I was given antibiotics and told to keep area clean.They did clear up entirely after about a week.I had them for two weeks previously before I had gone to doctor.I now have boils popping up again,but around my bellybutton area.What could be causing these?I also had a case of the shingles in this same area when I was eleven years old(many years ago).I\u00a0\u00a0am very concerned about whether they are contagious or not as I have seven kids and do not want them to suffer with this.",
