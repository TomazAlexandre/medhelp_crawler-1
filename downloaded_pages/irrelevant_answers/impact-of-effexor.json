            "answer": "My mother is also taking Effexor along with many other medications.\u00a0\u00a0I do not think Effexor can cause memory loss (if anything, it should improve her memory), but perhaps the reason she is taking the medication is affecting her memory.\u00a0\u00a0Mother suffers from GAD (Generalized Anxiety Disorder) and this disorder with the constant turmoil in her brain (I believe) is causing Mother to forget.\u00a0\u00a0Also, she is so fatigued from her disorder as well as other health issues and I know this is causing some forgetfulness.\u00a0\u00a0Finally, Mother has had three major surgeries in the past five years, and the affect of the pain medication as well as the anesthesia has caused \"damage\" to the brain.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, dementia as you mentioned is also a cause.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, I think it is a combination of many things that cause these issues.",

            "answer": "Many psychiatric drugs can affect memory. The effect isn't sudden. It may build up slowly so keeping a daily record is wise. Atypical antipsycohitics are often given to the elderly to make them compliant. The side effects include diabetes and an earlier than expected death.Benzodiazepines have been the worst offenders. Medicare no longer will cover this class of drug. Sometimes things do go right.My mother was an extremely difficult woman. it wasn't easy to find a nursing home\u00a0\u00a0willing to take her. We used their in house doctor. She was drugged out of her mind. We did change the facility to the other one that was willing. We found an independent doctor who prescribed only the necessities for her as opposed as for the staff.With this better treatment she eventually quieted down and had actual conversations. The staff began to like her and visit her many times during the day. This was a blessing because we were exhausted trying to care for her at home day and night. She needed real nursing.The elderly often need family to watch everything that is prescribed. Look it up and question the reason for using it. Sometimes an allergy or sensitivity can\u00a0\u00a0muck up brain function. The damage is not always permanent.",
