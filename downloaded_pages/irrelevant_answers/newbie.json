            "answer": "Hi Lynnie! I had absolutely no issues with my first pregnancy - no gestational diabetes (which diabetes runs rediculously through my family and I am hypoglycemic), no blood pressure issues or anything. My blood pressure actually go lower while I was pregnant, although it's always around 108/75-ish. It went to like 100 or 103/70. The dr's was pleasantly surprised about that even though there wasn't anything to worry about. My cholesterol has always been good - could be better, but always good - it actually got better after my pregnancy even though I'm heavier.I'm hoping this one will be the same!Also, my\u00a0\u00a0mom has been overweight her whole life - 180-260 was her adult weight range until she had gastric bypass in 2003. She had absolutely no issues with either of her pregnancies - very healthy. She gained 30-some lbs with my brother and then about 18 lbs with me.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "Hi all! I just found this group and glad to be a part! I'm 30 years old and currently 8 weeks 5 days along with my 2nd baby. I weighed 193 when I got pregnant with my DD, only gained 13 lbs. I lost my baby weight (although not the flubber!) when I nursed, but quickly gained it back when I couldn't nurse anymore. This time around I started off weighing 210! Ugh.. Oh well. I keep fluctuating in weigh so far - between 208 and 212. I'm of course p to 212 right now, but I'm sure that's because I have my first appt tomorrow, so of course the scale is going to show heavier just for that appointment! haha! I'll keep you all posted after my appointment!OH - and I'm about 5'4\" also.",
