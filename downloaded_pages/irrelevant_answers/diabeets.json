            "answer": "It depends. If your parents had diabetes or you have a family history of diabetes you have a higher chance of getting diabetes than one who hasn't. One way is you can inherit their diabetes genes [testing can determine this], another way, as most children do, you picked up their bad lifestyle habits voluntarily or involuntarily. By eating a proper nutrition/diet, exercise daily, and maintain a healthy normal body weight along with keeping normal cholesterol and blood pressure levels you have an excellent chance of keeping diabetes out of your life.",

            "answer": "Your original post asked about prevention and was answered. \"To rid of diabetes\" depends on a person's lifestyle; body weight, what he/she is doing to control and manage their diabetes, how often they test, what their daily results are, results of an A1c test, and whether they are following lifestyle guidelines mentioned in the earlier post.",

            "answer": "You asked: How to prevent Diabetes 2.My answer: First of all, check your A1C number to see if you are non diabetic 2\u00a0\u00a0meaning that number must be less than 5%., then reduce or cut your carb to this formula\u00a0\u00a0(10, 20, 20). To understand this formula read this book:\"Diabetes solutions\" by Dr.Richard Beirstein or go google his formula.If you have been consuming 2 cans of\u00a0\u00a0soda drink daily for the last 10 then you are likely a pre-daibetic 2 or already diabetic 2.Sadly any pre-diabetic 2 will b come one sooner or later.The\u00a0\u00a0inexpensive way to find out about your A1C is purchasing a home-test kit called A1C NOW at Walsgreen or Walmart .Once a diabetic 2 you will have it for life, again read the above mentioned book which is the best. Good luck",

            "answer": "But!.....BUT!....... There are plenty of warning signs before you reach a point where medication is required.\u00a0\u00a0If you react to those warning signs by switching to a low carbohydrate diet, you can keep the blood glucose levels pretty much normal by diet only even though you may be technically called a Type 2 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I'm walking proof.\u00a0\u00a0Less than one year ago, I stuck a fasting BG of 161.\u00a0\u00a0Today I regularly stick a fasting reading in the mid 80's with no medication. Make no mistake! I'm still a T2, and will always be.\u00a0\u00a0 It isn't easy to give up all of the \"white foods\", but I consider the alternative, and then the\u00a0\u00a0new lifestyle doesn't look so bad.",
