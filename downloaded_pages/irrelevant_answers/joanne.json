            "answer": "Running out of insulin is very dangerous for someone who is insulin dependent. Running very high numbers for a period of time can cause you to go into DKA. It's not as common in type 2's as type 1's but it can happen. There is nothing you can use that substitutes for insulin. Can you borrow money from someone? Perhaps your doctor has some he can provide or your pharmacy will give you credit? Is there a free clinic that can help you? Do you know someone else who uses the same insulin who could give you some?\u00a0\u00a0I would explore all possible options. If you are unable to obtain any insulin, keep testing your blood sugar. If it is high drink a lot of water. Exercise might help if it is around 200 but not too much higher than that when it could make it worse. If it runs consistently over 300 watch for signs of DKA: flu-like symptoms or vomiting and go to the ER if so.I know money is an issue especially if you don't have insurance but you might want to explore free or low cost medication sites or contact the company who makes your insulin and ask them, or buy extra when you do have money. Running out of insulin is not good. Good luck.",
