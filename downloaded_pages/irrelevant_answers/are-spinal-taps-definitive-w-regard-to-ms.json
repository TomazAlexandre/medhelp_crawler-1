            "answer": "A usual marker for MS is if\u00a0\u00a04 or more oligoclonal bands are found in the CSF. Usually it is the spinal tap that puts the pieces together. When MS crosses the BBB (blood brain barrier) it leaves evidence in the CSF. MRI can not always pick up lesions and you may not always be having symptoms; however I do believe that the marker left in the CSF is almost like a fingerprint to the physician making the diagnosis. If you had a spinal, the dr who ran the tests of your CSF fluid would also make the likely call on a diagnosis with the oligoclonal bands. I know that this is true in my case of MS and also in my father in law who was just diagnosed with MS and our spinal taps were done at different hospitals.Good luck.",
