    "question": "I just had prostate surgery last week and I had edema 3 days later in my left foot. I am diabetic not on insulin. I'm 52, and I think that the edema was just a result for me just sitting around. I went to the emergency room in response to requests from my surgeon. They did a sonogram of my legs to make sure that there was no blood clot. I also have a UTI. Even though it's nowhere near as bad because I have been more mobile, less sitting, more laying with my feet up, I still have edema on the front pads and smaller toes on my left foot. Is this something I should be concerned about at this time... Neuropathy?",
