            "answer": "Quick question: why are you being induced? (Post term, gestational diabetes, pre eclampsia?)I have some basic info on induction in my journals on my profile, along with my birth story (I was induced because my water broke and labor never started).I'd also recommend asking for your bishop score prior to the induction. It can give you a guide as to whether your induction will be successful. Good luck!",
