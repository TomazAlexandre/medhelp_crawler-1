            "answer": "With the dry eyes, they should run the test for sjogrens IMHO (not a doctor) as with one test they can figure it out.Low cortisol usually means a loss of weight, not increase. I had elevated cortisol myself - and while usually they have diabetes and high BP, I did not. So you can vary quite a bit with cortisol issues which can make them complex to diagnose.Adrenal fatigue is not medically accepted.",
