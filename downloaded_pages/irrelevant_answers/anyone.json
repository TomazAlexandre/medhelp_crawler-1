            "answer": "Describe to us your first \"flair\". How long did it last? Also how long have you had the leg numbness?You may have to ask, but the MRI of the Brain, we're the lesions noted consistent with a demylinating disease.\u00a0\u00a0MS has a typical pattern on Brain MRIs.\u00a0\u00a0Usually that coupled with clinical presentation of symptoms (like the leg numbness) will get you DXd with MS.The lip thing, who knows, it definitely would not be classified as a flair, unless it persisted over 24 hours straight.JonM",

    "question": "Is it true that to be a \"MS\" symptom or \"flair\" that (whatever) happens has to last more then 24 hours?the reason I ask is yesterday at work, my upper lip felt numb it felt like tingling and also the right side of my face,\u00a0\u00a0didn't hurt just felt weired, numbness, pins and needles,,, after about 10 minutes I went into the bathroom to (make-sure) my face was not drooping. It wasent.but anyway it only lasted about 45 minutes or so then went away like it was nothing,so my question sence this only lasted 45 minutes and its not a MS flair then what do you think it is???also..I'm having a problem understanding the whole lesion thing,,So the neurologist said she is looking for MS so she wants a MRI and this is after many many blood tests,, full neuro exam/ etc then the results yes indeed there are lesions. but lets \"wait and see\" follow you closly come back in 3 months for another mri cervical and brain and we will go from there.can everyone have lesions that are just there/ like they mean nothing,,???thanksRay",
