            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!There are a few possibilities like hypothyroidism, peripheral neuropathy like in diabetes, peripheral vascular disease, Reynaud\u2019s phenomenon and very cold external temperatures. The other possibility is peripheral vascular disease. You would need angiogram or color dopplar for this.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

There are a couple of good articles in The Nourisher magazine by Bee Wilder or gogle the author.This discovery certainly solved mine problems after many years of suffering.I hope it helps you, it certainly will not harm you. In the night, for the cold feet try to wrap around them a magnetic strap. It gave me some relief before I learned aboutCandida Albicans.My previous attempt to write failed due to a mistake I made. Best of luck.Kind regards\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 nick1942",

    "question": "HiI have been experiencing cold feet (to the point where I have to run them in hot water several times a day - even now in the middle of the summer), a sore throat, fairly intense fatigue, and muscle aches for about 4 and a half months? I was previously very active and in good shape but I am unable to maintain activities more and more. I have seen my family doctor several times and infectious disease doctor once so far. The only thing abnormal in my bloodwork and tests has been my wbc. Its been on the low side - about 4200. I know I cant get an exact diagnosis here - but does anyone have any thoughts?Thanks so much",
