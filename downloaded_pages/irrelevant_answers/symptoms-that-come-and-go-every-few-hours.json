            "answer": "You describe an energy surge as characterized by tachycardia and that may indeed be the feeling of a surge, especially if there is a rise in blood pressure (BP) that accompanies it.\u00a0\u00a0You need to obtain some objective data and I would begin by obtaining a blood pressure cuff, designed to let you easily take your own blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Keep a diary of your pulse and blood pressure, at least 4 times a day and especially when you have a headache or other symptoms.At some point you should have cardiac monitoring for 24 to72 hours.This could be anxiety but the symptoms could also be due to wild swings in your pulse and BP, as is seen, with a pheochromocytoma.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest that you be checked for this.\u00a0\u00a0You should also be checked for hyperthyroidism and a sleep disturbance.You should ask your doctor to arrange this monitoring and do the blood tests, especially so if you can document otherwise unexplained high blood pressure.Please give us a follow-up to let us know how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello, I have a hard time describing my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Please, please don't tell me to consider anxiety, I am absolutely certain there is something physcially wrong.\u00a0\u00a0First off I've suffered chronic daily headache for 3 years strait. I'm on no meds and I'm 30 years old.\u00a0\u00a0It started when I was having some energy surges in my abdomen/chest that gave me a high pulse and would send me into tachycardia and near syncope.\u00a0\u00a0 I also began feeling undescribably sick with a general malaise.\u00a0\u00a0 I immediately stopped smoking when these symptoms started and the syncope has abated for now, but I have a very uncormfortable diffuse feeling in my chest, up into my lower neck,\u00a0\u00a0and I have this \"air hunger\" that comes and goes.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I feel extremely ill, I wish I could make someone understand how bad it is.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms wax and wane.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I don't get especially short of breath when exercising, in fact I feel quite better while exercising, but after exercise, the \"air hunger\" typically gets worse and I crash into a bad episode of extreme malaise and discomfort.It also feels like when I am at rest, my lungs rest fully deflated and i have to make a conscious effort to breathe in.\u00a0\u00a0This is most present when I feel the air hunger and bad malaise,\u00a0\u00a0 it seems like the energy surges,\u00a0\u00a0malaise, air hunger (feel like I need to yawn but can't), chest discomfort are all interchangeable or go together (one may come when the other goes, or some come and go with each other).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I've also noticed, that even though I don't have any cough whatsoever, that I am able to clear my throat and expel small amounts of yellow or white mucus at least a few times a day.Please base your best guess based on the account that the standard CBC/chemistry, echo, Chest xray and EKG are normal.",
