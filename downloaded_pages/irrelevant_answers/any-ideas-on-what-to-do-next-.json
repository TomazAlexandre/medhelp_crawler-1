            "answer": "Hi,It seems like you have tried everything, I would now suggest a chiropractor. His symptoms sound like badly misaligned vertebrae and pinched nerves, MD's just are not trained to see this in x-rays, nor can they manipulate the bones, etc.Has he been tested for Fibromyalgia, sometimes and elevated sed rate can indicate that, or Chronic Fatigue syndrome.",

            "answer": "I'm so sorry you are going through this. You may want to see a neurologist. Some things that can cause this are Diabetes, stroke, Lou Gehrigs disease, Muscular distrophy, HIV, thyroid disorders, Polio, maybe some cancers? Is there any fever or loss of bladder control? Any swallowing difficulties or sagging of the face or problems with speech? Polio isn't in the Western hemisphere so if you live in the U.S. that wouldn't be likely.",

            "answer": "It sounds as tho he has inflammation in his joints.\u00a0\u00a0Rhumatoid Arthritis comes to mind, but you said he was tested for Arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that it came on quickly is rather puzzling.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if it could a neurological situation, but doubtful.\u00a0\u00a0Spider bites can sometimes create this situation, esp the brown recluse.The meds the Doc has prescribed basically only mask the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Steroids would eleviate the inflammation, but you need to find the source.If I were you and truly worried, a visit to the ER might work.\u00a0\u00a0They can order tests on the spot, and have results within hours.\u00a0\u00a0In an emergency setting insurance always picks up the bill, and you can get your MRI immediately.Double check tho with your policy just to make sure.This is what I would do.Keep me posted on what you find out.Take care....Kim",

    "question": "My husband is 56 and has been in good health. 3 weeks ago he woke up with severe pain in both hips (front) and shoulders. The pain is severe, he can barley walk, he is unable to work he can't sleep. We have been to our dr. numerous times she has done compete blood work, all arthritis neg, lupus, neg, lyme neg. he has had chest xray, mri of neck and now we are waiting for insurance to approve CAT scan. He has lost weight, his muscles in his legs, arms appear to be just going away. I am worried sick. Dr has prescribed Naproxen, hydrocodone.\u00a0\u00a0His sed rate was slightly elevated.\u00a0\u00a0The medication has not helped at all.\u00a0\u00a0I was hoping she would give him a low dose of a steroid to see if that gives him some relief. She refused that. We are so frustrated. What could this be... where do we turn?",
