            "answer": "Hello,What you are having is peripheral cyanosis and it becomes important to rule out vascular causes and other causes like Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon. It is a vascular disorder that affects blood flow to the extremities which include the fingers, toes, nose and ears when exposed to temperature changes or stress.I feel that a consultation of a physician will be the best. Other causes of blue peripheries like diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid also have to be ruled out. You may need to get a color Doppler and cardiac tests done to rule them out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hello doctor, thanks of your answer. But let me ask you one more thing, can a Raynaud attack be chronic? I mean, I've had that discoloration for two months, and it was triggered after overexercising. But during that time, the discoloration persisted, meaning that the colour never came back to normal since the day I overexercised.",
