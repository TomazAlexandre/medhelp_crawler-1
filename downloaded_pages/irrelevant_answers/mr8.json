            "answer": "High chloride blood levels are seen in persons who are recovering from diarrhea. They may also indicate a kidney problem or metabolic acidosis as seen in people suffering from diabetes mellitus.You should ask your doctor and talk about your worries.

Or was it because of a medical condition?",
