            "answer": "My doctor has me on metaformin (500 ER)for night time taking and I take my hypo medicine in the morning. I opted to take my Vitamin D at night with my metaformin\u00a0\u00a0 I did the low glycemic, weight watchers, Atkins, etc.\u00a0\u00a0before I was diagnosed with the metabolic disorder and did not see any weight loss results. I was in the gym everyday for 2 hours and still saw no weight loss. This went on for about 2 years or so. I decided to change my direction and push harder to find out what was wrong with my body. I got on the metaformin, Vitamin D with my hypo meds. I lost maybe 3 pds until I read the Thyroid Solution Diet. This diet is a low glycemic approach that incorporates the Mediterranean diet as well. My second lab results came back in 4/13 and my A1c is excellent, thyroid excellent, Vitamin D excellent, Cholesterol at 201 ( I need to watch this) and I feel whole now.",

    "question": "This is more of a testimony than a question. I am open to anyone who wants to know more about it however.\u00a0\u00a0I have been battling this disorder for a long time. I researched and challenged my doctors even when this meant to move on to the next doctor. I took the advice on this forum and finally came across a doctor that listened and followed up on what I thought was holding me back in losing the weight. I finally got my thyroid levels right with my last endo and now I was trying to get the rest of my body right. The doctor heard my cries and the lab results were that I not only hypothyroid but prediabetic and vitamin d deficient.\u00a0\u00a0I was happy to finally get some real answers to what was going on with my body. I love sugar beyond number and even with my hypo meds I felt tired.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking the additional meds and notice a difference immediately in how I felt. I still struggled with the weight loss until I came across this book: The Thyroid Solution Diet by Dr. Ridha Arem. He is a endocrinology with focus in slow metabolism. This book changed my life.\u00a0\u00a0It stopped me from going back to the weight loss clinic. I started this diet in February 2013 and as of this date July 27, 2013 I have now lost 45 pds. I am sooooo happy as it was so hard to lose weight. I borrowed this book from the library just in case you think I am advertising or pushing his book.\u00a0\u00a0Just try it out and see. If you can look back at my earlier post and you will see the difference in what I am saying now. I have hope!!!",
