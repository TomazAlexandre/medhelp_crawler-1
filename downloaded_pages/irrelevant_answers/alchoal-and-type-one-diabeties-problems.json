            "answer": "Dear gmoney,I've seen your questions on another thread and glad your still asking questions.\u00a0\u00a0As a volunteer and mother of a 27 year old with diabetes, he also had issues of the safety of having a beer.\u00a0\u00a0He found that because of the sugar in alcohol it would send his bs skyhigh.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe because of the way the liver metabolizes alcohol (I could be wrong here), he could get a rapid falling of his bs and have a pretty severe reaction.\u00a0\u00a0Also, any mind altering drug, alcohol included, will distort your ability to recognise when a low bs is coming.\u00a0\u00a0We all know how dangerous this is.\u00a0\u00a0Hate to sound like a Mom and preaching, but at 15, I hate to see you having to even deal with these issues. If you feel that it maybe a problem, please tell someone.\u00a0\u00a0Teens have so much pressures these days, especially with these issues and it dosn't help when you also have diabetes. I answered on your other question and appreciate your willingness to get the information you need.\u00a0\u00a0Please keep in touch and I commend you for your courage to be so open.\u00a0\u00a0Stay safe.DMP.S.\u00a0\u00a0I love the fact you are looking into film making.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you are very creative.",

            "answer": "In response to your question several things come to mind.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that everyone with Type 1 diabetes needs to be totally aware of what is happening with their blood sugar all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Alcohol can inhibit this ability for one thing.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the symptoms of too much alcohol and hypoglycemia can be similar and you do not want anyone to confuse a low blood sugar for being drunk as they might not give you the proper treatment.When your blood sugar level starts to drop, your liver steps in. It sends glucose out into the blood, which helps you avoid or slow down a low blood sugar reaction. However, when alcohol is involved, the liver won't put out glucose again until it has taken care of the alcohol. If your blood glucose level is falling, you can quickly wind up with very low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0This is why drinking on an empty stomach can lead to very low blood sugar. Alcohol can cause low blood sugar for up to 12 hours after drinking.Alcohol is also full of empty calories and adds no nutrition to your meal so if weight is a problem, cutting back on alcohol would be a good place to start. Some diabetes problems/ complications can become even worse like blood pressure and triglycerides when alcohol is involved.All kinds of factors can throw off your blood sugar with unpleasant and sometimes dangerous consequences. I would have to agree with your doctor, but if you choose to drink, limit the amount and have it with food, not on an empty stomach (and check your blood sugar more often).Have a wonderful day.",
