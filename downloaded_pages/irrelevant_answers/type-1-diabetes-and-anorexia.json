            "answer": "I sit here and think - again. I can somewhat recognize the fear of food in your daughter that I had. I did very soon learn my limits. I still use my bloodsugar as a meassure to when my ED flowers up. It still does that... I know how far I can push it and it's happened more times than I admit that I've walked 2 days without food, but my limit does go at 3 days. Having diabetes, she might see an obstacle and take up a more aggressive battle.There are 2 things I think you maybe want to consider:1. Fear/anxiety of food2. Teach your daughter how a diabetic diet means she gets control of food (so much control that she soon won't consider it a threat to her weight).Has she had a dietician help her with a foodplan?I know I've posted to you on the depression forum too. I really hope and pray you'll find some helpful answers here on MH!Florena",
