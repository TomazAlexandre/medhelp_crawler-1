My heart would race faster than normal, my legs would shake at times and I felt like I was going out of my mind.\u00a0\u00a0Any Dr. that tells you to relax - specifically when you are feeling like that is not a Dr. worth having.\u00a0\u00a0I was treated w/ radiaition to knock my thyroid from going crazy - my lab results were also through the sky - and regret it more than anything.\u00a0\u00a0I truely believe that there is a HUGE connection between being treated w/ radiation to slow your thyroid down and thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0I am living proof.In 2006 I was diagnosed w/ Thyroid Cancer and had a\u00a0\u00a0radical surger - cut from ear to ear b/c it had spread so quickly -which is unsusal - but b/c I got pregant, the estrogen my body produced acted like a fertilizer for the cancer.I STRONGLY SUGGEST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You find another Dr. and get yourself regulated b/c you lab resluts are not in the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0I just had a TSH test done and I was 0.26 the normal range is 0.34-5.60 according to the Dr.s at Emory University in Atlanta, GA.I live in kennesaw 1 hour away (without traffic) from the hospital but I go to the very best available to me b/c it's sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo very worth it.\u00a0\u00a0Find out if one of your Dr.s (maybe your primary care physician) can give you something to calm you down while you figure out how to your body back to normal.Don't let anyone tell you to relax when you are feeling the way you are - I know, I have been there and there is no possible way to relax - especially when it feels like you are running a marathon when you are not even moving.Good luck!Linda",
