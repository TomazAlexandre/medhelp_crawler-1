            "answer": "Dear Mr. Fixit,Sorry to hear about your fatigue. Most people return to a normal level of functioning following their bypass surgery. I would recommend discussing these symptoms with your doctor. He/she may want to perform a stress test or evaluate your medical regimen inorder to determine whether or not a medication could be contributing to your symptoms. I would also discuss participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program to improve your level of conditioning. Hope this helps.Thanks for your question,CCF-MD-KE",
