            "answer": "First of all, congratulations on the great control.\u00a0\u00a0For those of us who have been working on control of our diabetes for years, I think we would all agree that it doesn't get any easier.\u00a0\u00a0One of the hard parts for me is that anytime something unusual happens in my body, I immediately wonder if it is related to my diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it is, but sometimes it is not.I'm sure you have already looked at how much and when you drink and if your drinking habits have changed since you started having this problem.\u00a0\u00a0I know that if I drink water, I urinate more frequently than if I am drinking diet soda or even coffee.\u00a0\u00a0Urinating more frequently doesn't necessarily mean there is a problem.\u00a0\u00a0It could be good thing.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a doctor,but maybe your kidneys are functioning more efficiently.You do seem a little young to be having bladder problems, but there are people who have spastic bladders and resulting frequent urination.\u00a0\u00a0I always say, if this is a concern to you, I would get it checked out and I would have it done by a urologist. I am big on specialists because the body is just too complex for one doctor to know all there is to know about each part.Regarding caffeine and high blood sugars, I have not had that experience, but some people have odd reactions to the sweeteners in diet drinks.\u00a0\u00a0Splenda is actually a carbohydrate, albeit a very slowly metabolizing one.\u00a0\u00a0I would be interested in hearing if others have had a similar reaction.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, so many other things can cause spikes in blood sugars...hormones, stress, fatty food sometimes will raise people's blood sugars, etc.\u00a0\u00a0My advice is keep up the good work, get the kidneys checked out and as long as you keep having those great A1C's, enjoy your life because you're going to be around for a long time.Es",

            "answer": "Want to echo what's already been posted and to share some observations -- I'm another volunteer, and not a physician, so do check out this info with your doc.If our fluid balance is in sync, then every additional volume of fluid we take on, we will pass as urine.\u00a0\u00a0When we're slightly dehydrated, we can drink more & not pee so much, cuz our cells are soaking up the fluid.\u00a0\u00a0WHen we're well hydrated, additional fluid just gets excreted.As you may know, caffeine is a diuretic and so you might find you'll excrete more when you drink more caffeine.\u00a0\u00a0I hadn't heard about shrinking bladders in \"older\" men, as much as I've heard about enlarged prostate glands -- which put pressure on the bladder.\u00a0\u00a0You might ask your doc for a prostate exam, tho' you do seem young for that.Finally, I'm one of those whose blood sugar is affected by caffeine.\u00a0\u00a0Even from black coffee.\u00a0\u00a0For me, it was noticeable in the mornings and over the past year or two, I've gradually decaffeinated myself.\u00a0\u00a0The result?\u00a0\u00a0I can bolus for morning meal and get a predictable BG as a result.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also a pumper and I tried all sorts of other explanations for why I needed much more insulin with breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0By chance (cuz I loved my morning coffee), I had a day when I had only coffee and no breakfast -- high bg before lunch.\u00a0\u00a0I tried just water and no coffee -- predictable bg before lunch.\u00a0\u00a0A few experiments with & withotu caffeine & the results were irrefutable for me.\u00a0\u00a0Caffeine is a stimulant and it stimulated hormone production that required more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I can have a bit of caffeine in the afternoon, but I do that 1-2 times a month if I can't get a caffeine-free soft drink when I'm thirsty.",

    "question": "I am a 28 year old male and have been diabetic for 14 years now.\u00a0\u00a0The last six years I have been trying to maintain a disciplined regiment and having benefitted from switching to the pump, have seen good results including a A1C that hovers around 6.1.\u00a0\u00a0Personal kudos aside, I wanted to ask if anyone suffered from, or had any knowledge about excessive urination NOT due to high BG levels.\u00a0\u00a0Over the last two years I have noticed that I go to the bathroom a lot more that I used to.\u00a0\u00a0Always when I wake up (sometimes I will wake up in the night just to go to the bathroom and then go immediately when I wake in the morning).\u00a0\u00a0I can easily go four or five times in an 8 hour workday.\u00a0\u00a0When I feel like I am going to the bathroom excessively\u00a0\u00a0I will check my BG levels more frequently and many times is not explained by high levels.\u00a0\u00a0I am also not spilling ketones either.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0I know I am getting older and many men complain of shrinking bladders, but there must be something scientific causing this phemnomenon.\u00a0\u00a0 I have asked my doctor and he is was not concerned as long as my BG levels were not high and I wasn't spilling ketones.\u00a0\u00a0Another thinly related question I had was if anyone else had experienced a spell of high blood sugars from drinking a lot of caffine.\u00a0\u00a0This is not the cause of my bladder trouble, but I did experience an unexplained spike in my BG levels yesterday after drinking more than usual amounts of caffine (but all in no-sugar/diet drinks).Any ideas?",
