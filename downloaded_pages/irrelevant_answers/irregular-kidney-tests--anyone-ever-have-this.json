            "answer": "If they thought your kidneys were in the least bit compromised they would not give you contrast dye. There is a combination of things together which would send off a red flag. Tests are indicators it takes a doctor who knows what medications you are on and your over all health to make an assessment.Mine are high but the doctor tells me that my blood work is great.You probably should talk to a financial planner. I went to a free seminar our local NMSS had with a finacial planner. I would not know what to tell you.Alex",

            "answer": "Thanks, Alex.\u00a0\u00a0I am very concerned about the dye and have no idea why my tests results were ignored.\u00a0\u00a0I am quite upset a little it this because I am dizzy and very short of breath.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why the nurse is dismissing this problem, too.\u00a0\u00a0I can't get in to see my GP tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0I will have to take off from work Monday or Tuesday to ask him all of these questions.\u00a0\u00a0The more I read, the more scary this is.\u00a0\u00a0My test results show stage 3- moderate kidney dysfunction and this was before the MRI and dye and before I became violently ill, took a toxic over the counter medicine for the kidneys and got very dehydrated.I will look for my local NMSS.\u00a0\u00a0I have never thought about this because this came up so quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I never thought I may (could be jumping to conclusions) with chronic kidney disease.I am wondering if the gladolium caused problems with my kidneys in the first place.",

            "answer": "Hi Deb -Gadolinium can be a problem for people with compromised kidney function, and chronic bladder problems can cause kidney issues. I would discuss your results and concerns with your PCP.Kyle",

    "question": "I am sorry it's been so long!\u00a0\u00a0It's been years!\u00a0\u00a0MS is somewhat silent, but to my surprise I happened on irregular tests results taken before my MRI with enhancement.\u00a0\u00a0To save time, I will copy and paste what I said in the kidney forum below; however, has anyone ever have abnormal creatinine and GFR tests?\u00a0\u00a0Can an infection or dehydration cause those?\u00a0\u00a0Can MS cause kidney problems from UTIs and bladder issues?\u00a0\u00a0Do any of you have this problem?Here's the post:Hello, this is the first time to post in this forum.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 53 yr. old female with multiple sclerosis and is overweight, but not obese, a history of high blood pressure, but is under good control.I went in for an MRI before Thamksgiving which included enhancement.\u00a0\u00a0They do a screening for kidney problems prior to the MRI.\u00a0\u00a0I never know the results.\u00a0\u00a0They went ahead and did the test.\u00a0\u00a0To my surprise, this time the results were posted online, and they were abnormal (which wasn't shared with my doctor).The GFR a was 47 and the creatinine was 1.20.\u00a0\u00a0I wrote the doctor's office (MS Specialist) the nurse responded.\u00a0\u00a0She said I shouldn't be concerned.\u00a0\u00a0She said when I go in to see my GP at my yearly exam that I could mention this, if I wanted and that it wasn't a cause for alarm.\u00a0\u00a0She said it was probably dehydration.What would cause these abnormal tests?\u00a0\u00a0Can mild dehydration cause it?\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned?Besides MS, these things may seem relevant:1) night sweats2)\u00a0\u00a0shortness of breath (just started 2 days ago)3)\u00a0\u00a0can't sleep4) on a seizure medicine- a generic of Klonopin5) taking Provigil for fatigue6) low vitamin D (for quite some- said not unusual for people with MS), but is normal now with 3000 units of vit D daily7) history of many UTI due to problems emptying bladder thought to be from MS8) urinary incontinence from MS9) urinary retention (thought to be from MS)10) hypothyroidism11) father died at 72 this year from stroke (related to diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0My diabetes tests have been normal12) violently sick Sunday through Tuesday- well after tests results) with food poisoning (husband got same thing).\u00a0\u00a0Right side of my back hurt very badly.\u00a0\u00a0Took Aleve.\u00a0\u00a0I have a hint of an ache there now, but this shortness of breath and dizziness has been a concern.Should I be worried?\u00a0\u00a0I retiring this month and my retirement plan doesn't include caring for my husband if something was to happen to me to get my entire annuity (he's older than me and insisted to do it that way).\u00a0\u00a0I am torn on whether to.change the plan to include him getting monthly annuity checks if I die before it's too late which will significantly lower my annuity.This sounds crazy, I know, but I have a lot on my plate!\u00a0\u00a0I have only days from retirement.Thanks and sorry so longDebThanks MS Forum",
