            "answer": "Hello,How are you?When there is major surgery surrounding joint and strong muscles there is often nerve damage from the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0However, there is damage also before the surgery and this is only compounded by the surgery itself.Further there may be infection after joint replacement also. The risk of infection in the weeks after the operation is increased if you have rheumatoid arthritis or diabetes, if you have been taking cortisone for prolonged periods of time, if the affected joint has had previous infection, or if you have infection anywhere else in your body.One thing that I want to ask you is that when did you have menopause? Feelings of warmth or hot flushes occur due to hormone changes in menopause. In that case, pls consult your obstetrician/gynaec.Pls consult your physician if the symptoms persist or you have fever or pain in the area.Take care and God bless.",
