            "answer": "Diabetic nerve damage normally does not present itself on just one side of the body like this. Nor does it happen suddenly. This sounds more like a pinched nerve or something like this. You may want to ask your doctor to check it out, or perhaps you need to see a chiropractor to see if your sudden sneeze caused you to jerk some body parts out of their normal positions. But, no, it does not sound like it is related to diabetes -- please do remember that those of us who answer questions on this web site cannot diagnose ANYTHING. We are not physicians, and even if we WERE, it would be impossible to diagnose problems based on simple one-sentence questions. We are people with lots of experience with type 1 diabetes, and so our answers must be received as such.",

            "answer": "I am a 24 year old diabetic. I have had diabetes for 16 yrs. I never evan knew how many complicatrions came with this disease until recently. I have nerve damage and I didn't evan know it. I had a heating pad on my leg and fell asleep. When I woke up I had third degree burns on my leg. I didn't evan feel the burn. You can have nerve damage and not evan know it until it is too late. My leg became infected and all. I had to go to the hospital and get a skin graph done to it. I take lyrica for the nerve damage. It helps with the numbness and burning sensations that diabetics tend to feel through there feet and legs. Good luck!!!",
