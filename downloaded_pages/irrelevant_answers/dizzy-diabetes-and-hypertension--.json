    "question": "Hi Dr.My Dad aged 51 years old working as chef in his own restaurant in India. Temperature in india 40 deg. 45 deg.1 month back in nights he was feeling dizzy (Vertigo) and also started vomiting.We went to doctor his blood pressure was 180/100. Which was alarming. Dr. gave him medicines but he still complained about dizziness.Then I suggested dr. to check his glucose in blood it was 307 gm/dl... shocking.Then we visited an MD. who practices for both hypertension and diabetes. He checked ECG for my dad. Which was normal. He consumes 2 tablets for diabetes and 1 for hypertension. But some times he still complains about dizziness.I check his diabetes 2 times a week and blood pressure daily.Analysis :Diabetes - (Glucose in blood)Fasting time : 120 - 130 mg/dl2 hours after taking meals : 207 - 230 mg/dlHypertension:124 - 134 / 89 - 100Today in the morning 4:00 AM. My dad complained about dizziness again. When he passes urine and after some time it was less. I think salts got rid off from body after urine passing. which made better for him.My Question is why he feels dizzy many times after consuming tablets.Should he stop working as chef as temperature is very high in noon + standing near heat.Or should we go to some Neuro Surgeon so that if any other problem is there in his head.",
