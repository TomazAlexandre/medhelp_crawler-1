            "answer": "Some studies state this but the results are inconclusive. I have advanced tardive dyskinesia which is a potential long term side effect of antipsychotics. An MRI of my brain before I started antipsychotics and years after when I had acquired advanced tardive dyskinesia was exactly the same so this research may not prove to be clinically accurate. Tardive dyskinesia and diabetes are potential side effects of the current generation of antipsychotics (the rate of tardive being the same for all atypicals, the rate of diabetes being the least for Abilify, Fanapt and Saphris). However, if a person has schizophrenia or another psychotic disorder they need to stay in treatment. Of far more importance there is a future generation of antipsychotics in development the NMDA receptor modulates (you can find a link to a study on Wikipedia as well) that will promote a fuller recovery and not cause tardive dyskinesia or diabetes. The antipsychotic I am on glycine (google \"Dr. Javitt, glycine\") in myself has promoted a full recovery from schizoaffective disorder. I am the first person to use it as a primary antipsychotic (by itself) but in the standard studies it is used as an adjunct antipsychotic (along with a conventional antipsychotic) but there are other NMDA receptor modulates in Phase II FDA study that are being studied as primary antipsychotics. Its good to update yourself on research but instead of using highly tentative studies to conclude that a person doesn't need antipsychotics find out about research into new treatment modalities and find some way to advocate that more research and development be done into newer and safer treatment modalities as regards antipsychotics.",

            "answer": "I am not an expert first of all, but I can tell you this much.I have been told that shrinkage of the brain is normal as we all age.A neurologist claims the brain shows shrinkage and the psychiatrist states this is perfectly normal as we all age; both are medical doctors; go figure...I have no knowlege on whether or not meds can cause brain shrinkage.",

            "answer": "Heard arguments for brain shrinkage and against it in the form of antipsychotics actually causing neurogenesis where the brain basically repairs damage to itself from disease or trauma or whatever.\u00a0\u00a0They think it might enlarge parts of it but these studies are all inconclusive like ILADVOCATE said.Does anyone by any chance know why the brain shrinks as we age?\u00a0\u00a0I sure don't.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe it could be a clue to rapid grey matter loss in this illness?",

            "answer": "Hi Corlen,The shrinkage of the brain is only something I was told, but is it\u00a0\u00a0accurate and true for all people; I don't believe it can be and how can anyone really know because the entire population would have to have testing done and statistics would then have to be made.So much is said about general shrinkage as we age and I don't believe it's important at all...We lose an inch in height it is said also as we age; eh, so what, no big deal and bet you that some even gain an inch in height; hahahaha....I believe the body and it's organs do take care of themselves more often than we think...Studies cannot be conclusive because new studies are always done and they all contradict each other so like I say; go figure and don't worry about a thing...: )",

    "question": "I have a relative who has been taking Olanzapine for a while now.\u00a0\u00a0I recently found some information that suggests Olanzapine may be associated with brain shrinkage.\u00a0\u00a0Stopping the Olanzapine medication is probably not a safe bet at this moment since this relative is likely to revert back to previous destructive behaviors caused by his/her mental illness, but on the other hand I think it would still be worthwhile to be informed on this as brain shrinkage is also rather concerning.These seem to suggest Olanzapine is associated with brain shrinkage (at least in monkeys):http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olanzapinehttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antipsychoticshttp://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v30/n9/pdf/1300710a.pdfhttp://www.mail-archive.com/***@****/msg23289.htmlOthers suggest that Olanzapine is actually NOT associated with brain shrinkage - rather, it's only Haloperidol that is:http://www.docguide.com/news/content.nsf/news/8525697700573E1885256DDB0056F836http://mentalhealth.about.com/b/2003/11/12/haloperidol-may-exacerbate-brain-shrinkage-in-schizophrenia.htmI realize that there is no way we can conclude that either of these claims are correct, but does anyone have any guess as to which claims are probably more accurate, and your reasons for thinking this?\u00a0\u00a0My initial response upon reading the above is that Olanzapine is not associated with brain shrinkage in humans, and that it may be associated with brain shrinkage in monkeys but that there is not enough conclusive evidence that Olanzapine was a CAUSE of such brain shrinkage rather than just a correlation.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still not convinced I am on the right track in thinking this though and would like some experts' opinions on this.",
