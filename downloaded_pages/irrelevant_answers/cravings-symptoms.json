    "question": "Since Jan 08, i have lost about 35lbs, no diet or exercise. I have always basically always ate what i wanted (fast foods) and had always stayed at the same weight 115-120. Never gained nor lost, until the last 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0I have always had cravings of salty foods (chips, saltines), and meats ( grilled chicken, deli meat, tuna, beef) that I usually just eat by itself. I had graves disease/hyper back in 94, but had a TT to take care of it. In the last two years i have been to my doctor and numerous specialists and still no answers. I have been defiecent in Vit D and B12, but my levels are back up due to taking those vitamins. I sometimes never feel full after eating a lot, i will usually eat dinner twice an hour apart, like my body is burning the calories and i am completely empty. Sometimes if i do not get the salty chips i will feel like i am getting jittery. I have been tested for numerous things, but every thing comes back normal. Addisons, diabetes, diabetes insipidous. My regular doctor thinks i have some absorbtion problem, and my GI dcotor thinks i have diabetes. Still doing tests with the GI doctor and more tests with a urologist (constant urination). By the way, for all the salt i eat, my sodium level is okay (end of low range) and surprisingly enough i do not retain water. Can the salty foods and meat cravings be causing all of this? The only medication i am on is for thyroid.Here are my current symptoms: weight loss, low weight, salty food cravings( but never use table salt), meat cravings, constant urination, muscle aches in thighs/legs.",
