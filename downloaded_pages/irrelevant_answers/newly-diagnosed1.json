            "answer": "Controlling Type 2 diabetes for three years with diet and exercise for three years is great, nikita. It sounds like maybe your husband wasn't given much information on diabetes when he was first diagnosed and he didn't do any learning on his own. Diabetes is a progressive disease and to progress to needing medications and eventually to insulin is fairly common. I'm not really sure what the doctor meant when he said his pancreas will not function again. In addition to the A1C did he do any other tests such as c-peptide? This will tell how much insulin his pancreas is actually producing. Type 2 diabetics initially produce sufficient insulin but they are insulin resistent and that is what the meds help with. Over time they produce less and less insulin.The work your husband did on controlling his diabetes with diet and exercise is not lost! Those are still very important tools in addition to whatever meds the doctor prescribes. Also if he loses that extra weight that will help him control the diabetes as well.I'm always puzzled when a spouse posts instead of the person with diabetes. Do encourage your husband to take control of his own diabetes by educating himself.",

            "answer": "I would like to add to Zoelula's post by commenting on \"his HbA1C was 6.9 and is now around 10.3.\" To have an elevated A1c indicates his nutrition/diet was NOT being well controlled. There are many web sites with recommended foods & meals by Googling \"diabetes nutrition.\" Three important avenues helping to control T2 diabetes are proper nutrition, normal weight, and moderate exercise. Walking briskly, not pleasure walking,\u00a0\u00a0for 30 minutes after meals or at least 4 times weekly brings about good results.\"the Dr said the pancreas will not function again, he will be on meds all his life \"You kept from us how the doctor determined this. But taking meds for life should be looked at as taking vitamins for life. One should not get depressed for getting healthier.At 52 yo your husband needs to take control of his own health and read and understand what he needs to do about his T2. You can help but the responsibility rests on his shoulders. Controlling and managing diabetes is a simple task. Its not life threatening unless its ignored.Good places to start getting diabetes educated are:http://www.diabetes.org/http://www.emedtv.com/video.htmlhttp://www.glycemicindex.com/",

            "answer": "You're welcome. Thanks for posting back. The three main ingredients for diabetes T2 control and management are:1. Proper nutrition2. Normal weight3. Moderate exerciseA fasting [prandial] reading of 240 mg/dl is very high. Is he having late night desert type snacks laden with sugar? Or eating a large carb laden meal before bedtime? If yes to either one, he needs to stop immediately. If not, discuss this with his doctor for his liver may be producing too much glucose while he's sleeping.Until he gets his glucose levels under control your husby needs to test before meals and 2-3 hours after each meal [postprandial]. Why? Before meals provides a base measurement, a foundation to see if the foods consumed are increasing his glucose levels. You will know this with the postprandial test results. This is the method for learning proper nutrition; what one can and cannot eat. Doesn't matter if you could eat \"that\" when you had GD, it may be the opposite for your husband. The only way to know is test, test, test.",

            "answer": "I don't feel your husby's doc is correct to say 250 mg/dl is OK when normal fasting is 70-99 mg/dl. And 2-3 hours after a meal is <180 mg/dl, others say even less of <140 mg/dl. As you can see the 250 mg/dl is way of target. This link defines glucose levels http://diabetes.webmd.com/blood-glucose?page=3I do commend you for trying to get your husbands level lower but he's the one who has to watch his nutrition [what he eats]. Its not going to be an easy road for it took a long time for him to get where he's at but he will get there if he practices self control.Good luck.",

            "answer": "I totally understand how your husband feels, nikita. I have prided myself on eating healthy for many years, and perhaps feeling a bit superior to all the people around me who survive on junk food. I'm also a vegetarian so eating low carb is complicated. I just had to accept that controlling my diabetes was going to be a steep uphill battle if I didn't reduce my carbs. Testing two times a day isn't enough. In order to find the reactions to various foods it is necessary to test two hours after the meal. I have some concerns too about your doctor's lack of aggressive treatment. 250 is not ok, and if 250 is the goal, then occasionally it will be 300. Both numbers lead to longterm complications.Personally I would see an endo, not a regular doctor and have him do a c-peptide test to see how much insulin your husband is producing. If his insulin production is low then he will need to start insulin. He needs to get those numbers down.",

I'm not your marriage counselor but I don't think it's positive for you to have to play the \"bad guy\". Your husband is a mature man who should care about his own health. Yep, I know it's hard for kids. I live alone so can cook how I want. I don't know how old your kids are, but perhaps they can be taken for their baskin robbins treats separately. But since diabetes is genetic, they can only benefit by learning to eat healthy.If his pancreas were entirely \"dead\", that is not producing any insulin at all, your husband would not be able to survive without injections. I'm not sure why your doctor keeps saying that. The c-peptide is a simple test that can see exactly how much insulin is being produced.Keep up the good work!",
