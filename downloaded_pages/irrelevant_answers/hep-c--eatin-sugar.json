            "answer": "Hi Susan,I think if you look at the Pegasys full prescribing info sheet from Genentech:http://www.gene.com/gene/products/information/pegasys/pdf/pi.pdfyou\u2019ll see an entry listed under endocrine disorders (line 403-409):\u2018\u201cHyperglycemia, hypoglycemia, and diabetes mellitus have been observed to develop in patients treating with Pegasys. Patients with these conditions at baseline who cannot be effectively treated with medication should not begin Pegasys therapy. Patients who develop these conditions during treatment and cannot be controlled with medication may require discontinuation of Pegasys therapy.\u201dWhat\u2019s not shown is the rate of incidence; I think that would be very important data. As you mentioned above, there seems to be an increased rate of DM II among HCV RNA positive individuals; obviously, all risk/benefit needs to be weighed.I was diagnosed with diabetes type II prior to HCV Dx or therapy; I don\u2019t know if HCV had a casual effect on my diabetes or not. I do have immediate family members with it though, and they are not HCV positive.With all this said, I\u2019m not convinced that an HCV positive patient needs to be particularly wary of dietary carbohydrate/sugar intake during HCV treatment. Of course, if they have evidence they\u2019re not metabolizing carbohydrates for some reason, that\u2019s another story.--Bill",
