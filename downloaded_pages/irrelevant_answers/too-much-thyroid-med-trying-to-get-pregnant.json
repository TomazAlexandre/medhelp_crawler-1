            "answer": "This is a very old thread and the previous posters are no longer active on the forum.Unfortunately, they were only going by TSH, which is often suppressed for various reasons.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, TSH fluctuates greatly over the course of a day, so it's a very unreliable diagnostic.You should get your actual thyroid hormone levels tested.\u00a0\u00a0Those are Free T3 and Free T4.\u00a0\u00a0Adequate levels of thyroid hormones are essential for the growth and development of a fetus.\u00a0\u00a0TSH is not a thyroid hormone and does not adequately reflect actual thyroid hormone levels under many/most circumstances.",

    "question": "Back in July my TSH was 7.3.\u00a0\u00a0At the time I was on 25 mcg.\u00a0\u00a0My dr increased my dose to 100 mcg.\u00a0\u00a0A month and half later my TSH dropped to 0.25.\u00a0\u00a0He told me to keep the same dose, but skip one day a week.\u00a0\u00a0I just had it rechecked (about 6 weeks of skipping one day a week).\u00a0\u00a0Now the TSH is 0.01.\u00a0\u00a0So, I feel I'm obviously on to much med.\u00a0\u00a0He told me to now skip two days a week.\u00a0\u00a0Is that really going to make a difference?\u00a0\u00a0Can TSH levels go negative?\u00a0\u00a0I am also trying to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Is it safe for me to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I'm very frustrated w/ that because I've been keeping my blood sugar good for a year now.\u00a0\u00a0And then when I wanted to start trying in March, this whole thyroid thing came up.\u00a0\u00a0I got pregnant in June, but lost the baby at 6.5 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I really want to concieve/give birth to a baby.\u00a0\u00a0My fear is that because I have diabetes and thyroid disorder and a previous miscarriage, I will not be able to.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone gone through this?",
