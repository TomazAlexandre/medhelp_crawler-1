            "answer": "Hi, why do you want to reduce the dosage? is it the side effects? Tonact is Atorvastatin a drug in the group of statins which is used for high cholesterol. It is usually a safe drug. Main side effects are elevated liver function tests and and a condition called rhabdomyolysis. But these are not very common. Stopping the medication will depend on your cholesterol levels after taking the medication and your other problems like high BP, diabetes, family history of heart problem etc. Sometimes your doctor may advise you to continue indefinitely even if the cholesterol level is normal. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance. Regards.",

            "answer": "If you speak with your Doctor, they may agree to half your dosage, and then one month later take another cholesterol test. If the results show a rise in cholesterol, then you need the statins. If they stay the same, then you could try cutting further. It's the only true way to know whether you require them or not. Just remember though, only 15-20% of your cholesterol is due to what you eat. Your liver does the rest. There are certain foods apart from fats which encourage the liver to make cholesterol lipids too.",
