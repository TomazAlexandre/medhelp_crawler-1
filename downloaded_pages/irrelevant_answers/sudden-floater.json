Considering you have diabetes,take special care with both things and follow the diabetes treatment carefully,some floaters can be inofensive, only bothersome but any increase in size or number you better check with a retina doctor,Pay attention to flashes of light or so as well.Good luck!!",

            "answer": "Floaters have to do with the insides of the eye actually, so I am not actually sure dry eyes have anything to do with floaters really. Most people have them to different varying degrees, it's just that not everyone notices them. If you suddenly see many of them, or they keep getting worse, it is wise to see the ophthalmologist. Sometimes an occurrence like this can be an emergency especially if you see flashing lights too. Here is a good picture of vitreous floaters in the eye.
