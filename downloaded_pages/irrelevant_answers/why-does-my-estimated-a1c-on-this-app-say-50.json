            "answer": "Hi there, it sounds like you're doing great! If you email our support team at ***@****, they can tell you more about how the estimated A1C is calculated. Are you recording the numbers you get twice a day in the app? The more BG readings you enter, the more accurate the estimated A1C is. And remember of course, that an estimated A1C is just that, an estimate. But at 5.0 I believe you are well below the threshold for people with diabetes (per the American Diabetes Association, you want numbers less than 7%).",
