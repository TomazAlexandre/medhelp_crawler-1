            "answer": "Hello,I am a volunteer here, not a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0My input / advice is based on knowledge and experience in caring for my soon to be 11 yr. old son who was dxd at age 3.\u00a0\u00a0(Always seek medical advice from your physician.)Here is some info.What is a 2-hour glucose tolerance test?A glucose tolerance test measures your body's response to sugar. You drink a liquid containing sugar and then have blood withdrawn from a vein in your arm two hours later.What's normal?A normal level is less than 140 mg/dL (7.77 mmol/L).What level suggests prediabetes?If your two-hour glucose tolerance is 140 mg/dL (7.77 mmol/L) to 199 mg/dL (11.05 mmol/L), you may have prediabetes.What level suggests type 1 or type 2 diabetes?A blood sugar of 200 mg/dL (11.11 mmol/L) or higher two hours after you drink the sugar solution indicates you may have type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Your doctor may repeat this and other tests to confirm a diagnosis.___________________________________What is a fasting blood sugar test?A fasting blood sugar test measures the amount of sugar (glucose) in your blood after you fast for eight hours.What's normal?Your fasting blood sugar is normal if it's 70 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), or 3.88 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), to 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L).What level suggests prediabetes?If your fasting blood sugar is 100 mg/dL (5.55 mmol/L) to 125 mg/dL (6.94 mmol/L),\u00a0\u00a0you may have prediabetes.What level suggests type 1 or type 2 diabetes?A fasting blood sugar value by itself doesn't help distinguish between type 1 and type 2 diabetes. But a fasting blood glucose of 126 mg/dL (7.00 mmol/L) or higher is consistent with either type 1 or type 2 diabetes when accompanied by classic symptoms of diabetes",

            "answer": "If your insulin was a lot higher than normal but your blood glucose was in the normal range, it means that your pancreas is having to produce large amounts of insulin to keep your blood sugar down. So, yes, your are insulin resistant, even though you are technically not a diabetic.Insulin resistance suggests that you are developing Type 2 diabetes, even though your blood sugar levels are within the normal range. The experts are not sure what causes insuli reistance. But, to me, the most compelling reason is over-exposure to carbohydrates.You can restore the sensitivity of your insulin receptors by avoiding carbohydrates, getting exercise and losing weight. You have a limited window of opportunity before you become a Type 2. And now is the time to start working on it.Cheers,Mark",

            "answer": "I think what you meant to say was that your fasting glucose was in the normal range and your tolerance test was elevated.This indicates that you have either some degree of insulin resistance or lack of appropriate insulin production.It is hard to diagnose unless i have a clearer picture of your clinical status.How old are you?Are you overweight?",

    "question": "I had a glucose tolerance test and an insulin fasting (drinking the glucose drink) blood test done. I have seen my results but have not had them interpreted for me. My glucose fasting results came back within normal range but my insulin fasting results came back out of range for the 0,1, & 2 hour results. They were much higher than the normal ranges. Does this mean I have insulin resistance?",
