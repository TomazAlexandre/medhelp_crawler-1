    "question": "Hey ladies! I just found out today that I have PCOS! So, losing weight is going to be harder for me than I had hoped. It has always been hard for me to lose weight (now I know why) but I am considering the South Beach Diet. Anyone have good luck with that diet? I already work out, so now I just need to make sure my diet is in check. I have been counting calories and staying under 1300 but I don't think that is going to be most effective for me now that I know that i have severe PCOS. Doc told me that my testosterone level was high, even for a man!! So, as a woman, that didn't make me feel too great lol Anyways, just wanted to post and say UGH!!!!",
