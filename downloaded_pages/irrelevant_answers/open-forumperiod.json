It is just you still bleeding from having him. Even though you had a C-section, you can still bleed from having him.I go to the doctor today, can't wait. My husband says that I am going to have the baby today. I don't think so, but what ever makes him happen he can just believe it.",

Oh, I can't wait to find out what you see, OMG, what if it's twins. That would be cool!!As for me, AF is still really lite. Less then yesterday, weird. I'm starting to wonder why this is happening. I've never in my entire life had a lite AF. Not that they are extremely bad but never lite enough for the first couple of days for a pantyliner. It's dark now too, what's going on. I'm starting to wonder if it's an early m/c maybe. Chloe, how did your last AF go, I can't remember. I do know it was spotty for a few days but how was it at first and how many days, Maybe I'm pregnat. I'm flipping tired I know that.",
