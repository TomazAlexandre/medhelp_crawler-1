            "answer": "Hello.Since how long are you having this problem? Can you narrate the MRI report here, if you have a copy? You seem to have the pain either due to neuropathy or small vessels disease. Are there any lesions seen on MRI of brain?I can understand it must be difficult for you to manage with such varying pain with temperature changes. Do you have any other physical illness diagnosed?Regards",

            "answer": "Hello.The symptoms of itching and feeling of draining seem to be seasonal. There may be an allergic reaction involved here. The feeling of something draining inside the head can actually be due to the neuropathy. There is no continuous space extending from the head to the arms.You should get an inner ear assessment. The diabetes could affect the nerves and produce various symptoms of neuropathy.How is the blood pressure cuff injury?Regards",
