I never had an issue with dairy till I got pregnant and this is now my third pregnancy and its worse now then its ever been. First it was just milk and ice cream now its other things like cheese. My stomach will hurt and cramp up I get extra saliva in my mouth an my throat starts to feel like I have a lump in it and it causes me to cough. I heard probiotics will help but I'm not gonna try it till after the baby's born.",
