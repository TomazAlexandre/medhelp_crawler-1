There will be a higher risk of down syndrome but as you know it can happen to anyone. Take your prenatal vitamins especially folic acid and vitamin c. Make sure to avoid certain foods and make your appointment good luck xx",

Just keep in mind that even at 50, when odds of chromosomal problems are much higher, the odds are still strongly in your favor that the baby will be fine. Ask about NOT such as the Harmony test. It's fairly accurate but not perfect at identifying trisomy. I believe the accuracy is close to 99%, and it can be done fairly early (like 10 or 11 weeks). It's just a blood test, so there's no risk of miscarriage as there is with amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Just stay positive.\u00a0\u00a0Many women at your age have healthy babies.",
