            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Rectal bleed could be due to polyps, hemorrhoids or due to endometriosis. Consult a gastro specialist for this. You could be having bladder infection, cystitis or the kidney stone can be causing the symptoms. What was the fluid analysis of the ovarian cyst. You should consult an urologist and get a complete checkup. Also diabetes should be investigated.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response.I passed the stone back in december so it isnt that, and i dont think that they told me the fluid analysis for the cyst.Also, a few people have mentioned that i should be checked for diabetes, but ive never said anything to the doctor.I wrote to the forums for ideas to see if it was urgent or if i could wait it out.. only because i wont have health insurrance until after the 1st of May. and i already owe thousands to the ER. heh.The Rectal bleeding only lasted those three days(the second day was when i went to the ER for it).. i havent had it since.As of today, i am still having all of the symptoms i listed as well as some dizziness and nagging back pain between my shoulder blades with two different bowel movements (nothing really abnormal with the bowel, and not much straining)I dont know whats going on, but it seems like im always having problems with something :(",
