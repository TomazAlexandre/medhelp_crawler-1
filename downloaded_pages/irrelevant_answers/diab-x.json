            "answer": "Snake oil...no site list amount of ingredients in each capsule/tablet. To much chromium leads to ill health. If it was such a cure then why hasn't the American Diabetes Association made announcements proclaiming its wonder cure? No doctors backing this wonder cure? No major teaching hospital where doctors are trained using it or backing it? By the way, I went to the various university web sites and various test labs listed on several pages touting DIAB-X, and searched and searched for DIAB-X test results. Guess what? Nothing could be found on DIAB-X. Snake oil.",

All these claims of being tested by leading medical and educational centers is just a big fat old lie.

            "answer": "Dave....you should know that when you take one of us on, you take the whole forum on, and some of us have a background in diabetes and Clinical Research.\u00a0\u00a0So we know how to read studies.You are basically quoting studies done on some of the ingredients contained in Diab-X, but no human studies done on the product itself.Let's look at one of the claims made about Diab-X.\u00a0\u00a0The website says it.....\"Reduces weight regain after weight loss in animals.\".....and the study quoted as proof is titled.....\"Effect of hydroxycitrate on respiratory quotient, energy expenditure, and glucose tolerance in male rats after a period of restrictive feeding.\"This study, done in Switzerland in 2004, used 24 male rats which were basically starved for 10 days then fed a high glucose diet plus hydroxycitrate (HCA) supplement for 6 DAYS.\u00a0\u00a0Controls received the same diet without the HCA supplement.During the first couple of days, the respiration quotient (RQ) and energy expenditure (EE) decreased.\u00a0\u00a0The findings POSSIBLY reflected a decrease in de novo lipogenesis (fat production).\u00a0\u00a0But by day 6, the respiration quotient (RQ) and energy expenditure (EE) DID NOT DIFFER between treatment groups. HCA suppressed food intake during the first couple of days, but overall, (as stated by the study results), BODY WEIGHT REGAIN WAS NOT DECREASED in the HCA group.In other words, hydroxycitrate (HCA) DID NOT \"reduce weight regain after weight loss in animals\" as your website claims.So that makes one of your claims FALSE Dave.\u00a0\u00a0As you told Dot.Calm, I strongly urge you to go back to your site and review what the study says.Oh yes, the study also said, \"HCA MAY improve glucose tolerance\".\u00a0\u00a0But since an oral glucose tolerance test was only performed on day 4 or 5 of the high glucose diet, then there's really no way to compare to baseline, is there?\u00a0\u00a0That means there's no way to show improvement in glucose tolerance.Plus, you and I know that in the world of Clinical Research, a study done for 6 days on 24 RATS means absolutely nothing.Come back and talk to us when you can show us LONG-TERM Diab-X EFFECTIVENESS STUDIES done on HUMANS.",

            "answer": "I lost 20 pounds after taking DiabX for 30 days. I am prediabetic and have tried other sources of nutritional food supplements but I believe the reason DiabX worked so well is that it uses a superior chromium known as chromium as polynicotinate.I also feel the formula DiabX has put together incorporates other specific nutrients that makes it better than any product I have seen.I've researched and verified the studies and appreciate the fact that DiabX carries several US patents, is GRAS approved and verified as a USP/NF product made in America. Many people suffer from blood sugar imbalances that can lead to excess weight and increase risk of heart disease. I think it is important we share discoveries like this. Diabetes is NOT a drug deficiency. Even the American Diabetes Association agrees that type 2 diabetes \"can be reversed.\"If any one has failed to prevent diabetes, they need a cure. All the drugs people are taking do NOT address the root cause of blood sugar imbalance . . DiabX is guaranteed and it works for me. Pass it on!",

Made in America as all the ingredients are combined and put into capsules in an American factory? That's all you can claim. All the ingredients are NOT American made products so stop with bull misleading hype.I'm still waiting on \"proven test results\" that in 7 months no one has been able to provide, not even your dumb behind. And you have to wonder whether the Internet Crime Complaint Center or the Federal Trade Commission at http:///www.ftc.gov are getting the evidence needed to Diab-X down.",

            "answer": "reyb - I agree with you 100 percent. Far too much ego flexing by people who most likely do not have Type 2 Diabetes. No matter what is said, the montra remains the same - Snake Oil. Personal results can't count either because of conflicts of interests they have - no doubt they are drug reps pushing Metformin on everyone.In the end, its all about money and who gets it. The drug companies want their share, as does the natural cure folks. Diabetics are trapped in the middle. No matter which way you decide to try, one thing must happen: a change of diet and lifestyle. If you reverse Diabtetes (as I have) and do not change, you will go right back to where you started. That is beyond dispute.My advise - after making the change in your diet and activity level, look at your A1C. If it is higher than you would want, try some thing like Diab-X. Remember, you are in control of your treatment, don't let anyone take that away from you.",

If you wish to remain healthy... 1.) eat well, NO not eat cheeseburgers, fries, and a HUGE coke or Vanilla Shake as your staple foods. Eat well: Free Range Turkey, broccoli, tomatoes, black beans, fresh sweet potatoes, blueberries, and a tablespoon of apple cider vinegar every morning before\u00a0\u00a0you start your eating day... and include more wherever you can. Pay attention to your Glycemic loads... do NOT overload your system with products that will spike your insulin level. I have ABSOLUTELY zero faith in the FDA. They allow ALL these products in the food stores to be FILLED with sugar, so much sugar that it has induced a DIABETIC epidemic in this United States. There are very few products that have little to zero sugar in them. Read the back of the boxes. It is AWFUL! So whoever brought up FDA in this FORUM need to check their facts. The FDA are criminals!

There is NOT any product out there that will help anyone if one is NOT prepared to do what one MUST! Being healthy and remaining healthy REQUIRES work. Exercising everyday ... sometimes 2x a day when time permits, 37 minutes in the morning before 1200 hours and again in the evening before 1900 hours. Eating well is a MUST. NO, not calorie counting... making the BEST food choices you can to keep your human machine running. Yes, I advocate supplements, GREAT minerals and GREAT comprehensive multivitamins and GREAT B Complex... GREAT krill oil... however, that's about it!I was borderline Diabetic classified as 'Insulin Resistant'. Unfortunately, some people's pancreas do NOT make enough insulin. Is it hereditary? I don't believe in that stuff, Each person enters God's Universe with their own things to work through, hereditary does not have anything to do with it (that's another forum, elsewhere). It is my belief, I am confident you all have your own... and ALL is invaluable because it is your journey. However, I have made very every effort to pay attention to EVERYTHING going into my mouth as I do NOT wish to become diabetic. My grandmother passed away at 93 with Diabetes... however ten (10) years before that she had gone blind, and twenty (20) years before that she had acquired Alzheimer. Yes, I have read that Diabetes can cause Alzheimer in some people. Is it factual... I don't know. I don't believe in doctors, pharmacists, and researchers, as I believe they all have some MONETARY greed agenda.
