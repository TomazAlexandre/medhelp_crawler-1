From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may most likely occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here.

    "question": "Hi everyone,This is my first post here, I have no medical skills whatsoever so I'll try to explain my problem as good as I possibly can.Yesterday at 4:00 am a minor pain started in the palm of my left hand and it has been killing me ever since, I took a spray for spasm treatment thinking that it was just a regular spasm, at 9:00 am the pain started to hit other places in my hand up to my triceps.I am a 19 yo male and at that same night I was lifting buckets full of water. Anyway, I'm saying this to whoever can help me out there because the pain is getting more terrible by the minute and I believe that its a nerve-related issue.",
