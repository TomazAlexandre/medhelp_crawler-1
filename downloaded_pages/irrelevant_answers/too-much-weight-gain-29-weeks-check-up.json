            "answer": "I don't know about your doctor, but I have gained 25 lbs this pregnancy (I am 28 weeks) and my doctor is worried I am not gaining enough weight! The average recommended weight gain is between 25 and 40 lbs depending on your pre pregnancy weight. In fact, she had me cut down on jogging for an hour a night so that the baby could gain more weight (I gained only 1 lb last month, and a LOT more in early pregnancy)",

            "answer": "I have gained that much as well, and my Dr. said it is totally normal. As long as the baby is fine, it's FINE!! Dont let your Dr make you feel guilty! You ARE pregnant and supposed to gain weight!! As long as you eat healthy and your glucose tests came back ok, I think you are just fine!And measuring off a little is also totally normal. I am 36 weeks, but my last appt. (1.5) weeks ago, I was measuring 35.5 weeks.. So I am measuring approx. 1 - 2 weeks ahead too.. Everyone grows and measures different! =)",

            "answer": "Just because you were measuring a little bigger doesn't mean your baby is going to be big. I measured a week bigger then I was and Noah was only 7lbs 7oz.Don't worry too much about the weight gain just watch what you are eating for the remainder of your pregnancy as it is true that you don't want to gain too much.",
