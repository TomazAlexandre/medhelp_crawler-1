            "answer": "Type 2 diabetes develops slowly but Type 1 develops very suddenly. However it sounds like you have done all you can to check for diabetes and you are fine. It is not certain at all that you will develop diabetes just because it is in your family.I agree with Sally that you should seek a referral to see if you are suffering from an anxiety disorder and need treatment.",

    "question": "Sorry english is not my native language !I have posted couple of times similar question\u00a0\u00a0. I am 29 year old andI have family history of diabetes . 6 months back this thought came in my mind ,that i am developing diabetes. From that day\u00a0\u00a0I been to hospitals many times for glucose test\u00a0\u00a0whenever any ill symptoms appear . Almost everyone is saying I am not a diabetic . In fact they wonder when they see my strange blood glucose test results.\u00a0\u00a0Today as a final confirmation I took\u00a0\u00a0FBS and PP test . Fasting 6.1 mmol (109.8 mg)\u00a0\u00a0 After taking breakfast (2 hours later) 5.6 mmol (100.8) .\u00a0\u00a0The lab technician\u00a0\u00a0took a marker and correct the fasting result 6.1 to 5.3 mmol (95.3mg).I dont know why she did so . I can see the correction mark clearly.\u00a0\u00a0I came out of hospital and tested blood sugar with my glucose meter\u00a0\u00a0it is 5.5 (mmol).\u00a0\u00a0 Again I am back to my worry\u00a0\u00a0home . I have many questions about developing diabeties.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes develops gradually ? or suddently it attacks ? . from the last 6 months , I am taking care of my diet and doing exercise for 45 mins daily .Presently i am suffering with anxiety and stress .",
