    "question": "I am a sixteen year old girl and i have been having stomach pain for about 9 months now. the pain is usually in the upper left side and radiates out. sometimes it feels like someone is squeezing my upper intestines and my rib feels like its popping in and out of place. my symptoms are weight loss, severe constipation, headaches, bloating, gas, and loss of appetite. Ive had and endoscopy, colonoscopy, cat scan, xray, multiple blood tests, allergy tests, diabetes test, fructose intolerance test, and stomach motility/emptying test and the doctors haven't found anything except lactose intolerance. I tried an IBS diet but that did nothing to alleviate my symptoms (it might have even made the worse especially the bloating). ive tried cutting out dairy and gluten from my diet and nothing works. The pain is so bad that ive had to miss 15% of school this year. please help me. i am in so much pain. help",
