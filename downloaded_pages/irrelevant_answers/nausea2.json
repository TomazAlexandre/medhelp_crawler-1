            "answer": "Hello,Chronic nausea can be due to stomach disorders such as gastroenteritis, liver/gall bladder disease, cancer, medications, inner ear diseases like labrynthitis, ulcers/gastritis, metabolic like diabetes, hypothyroidism and adrenal diseases or neurological causes.Take an OTC lactobacillus preparation and yoghurt with your meals. Drink plenty of fluids and eat small nutritious meals at frequent intervals instead of a heavy single meal. Exercise frequently and take your dinner atleast 2 hrs prior to bedtime. Also raise the head end of the bed by 2 blocks.You can also take some antacid or OTC medications like omeprazole and ranitidine. If the symptoms persist then get it checked from a physician.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
