            "answer": "Sorry I'm not sugarcoating this!\u00a0\u00a0And you're probably not going to like my answer any more than you liked your doctor's attitude.\u00a0\u00a0But you need a serious answer to your question, \"What does someone do in a case like this?\" (218 blood sugar), and no one has addressed that, so I will.STOP EATING LIKE A PIG!\u00a0\u00a0There is NO ONE who should be eating the way you have been, whole cakes, TWO lava cakes, eclairs, etc, diabetic or not.\u00a0\u00a0You're darn lucky your numbers aren't in the 300 or 400 range the way you're eating!\u00a0\u00a0Just because you may not have BEEN a diabetic doesn't mean you didn't cause yourself to BECOME a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0And by the way, being overweight isn't the only way to become diabetic, so the fact that you gained 6 pounds but are not overweight doesn't mean a thing.As for your fasting blood sugar being 100, that's actually OK.\u00a0\u00a0Normal range is between 70 to 100 milligrams per deciliter.\u00a0\u00a0But it sounds like you may have an overactive thyroid gland based on the fact that you aren't overweight and absolutely should be if you're eating the way you say you are.\u00a0\u00a0And an overactive thyroid gland can be a cause of high blood sugar readings.I am very sorry you lost your husband and your son.\u00a0\u00a0No one should have to go through that!\u00a0\u00a0But destroying your health is not the answer.\u00a0\u00a0As others have suggested, get help.\u00a0\u00a0There are a lot of support groups, check them out.\u00a0\u00a0Get a doctor you do like and tell him you're depressed.\u00a0\u00a0There are medications you could take if support groups aren't enough.Oh, and as for not being able to exercise because you're a senior citizen, baloney!!!\u00a0\u00a0I am a senior, have multiple sclerosis (and a lot of other things including diabetes) and I exercise every day, typically walking a mile or two each day if my legs are working, swimming and treading water for about 2 hours on days I can, and basically there isn't a day that I don't at least walk half a mile, even if I need my walker to do it.\u00a0\u00a0There are senior groups who get together for exercise, senior water aerobics at a lot of the YMCAs and other community pools, and simply taking a walk around the block is exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you're in a wheelchair, there are exercises that can be done, unless of course you're a quadriplegic.\u00a0\u00a0Age\u00a0\u00a0has nothing to do with it.\u00a0\u00a0And exercise is a great cure for simple (not chronic) depression, a whole lot better than eating yourself sick.",

            "answer": "thank you for your spectrum--sorry for your health issues--i did not say i couldn't exercise--in i said i don't exercise--i needed to vent the day i wrote this--i pray you never lose a child--your life becomes unmanagible and there is no logical explanation for it--you do things you would never do otherwise--you reach out for people places and things but don't always get want you need ( i was reaching for food )\u00a0\u00a0i was given a new meter and bought strips and i am back to the ranges i was before ( of course i stopped the collision course i was on for about a month ) my blood work, once again came back normal so my thyroid is fine--i like this dr--he listens to his patients--doesn't tell you what to do but offers advice.",
