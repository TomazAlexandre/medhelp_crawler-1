            "answer": "Hi,I does sound like yeast to me.Yeast can be very difficult to clear up and can be a sign of other more serious problems like diabetes.It is allways best to have it correctly diagnosed by a doctor.Creams like Canesten and Monistat can help to get rid of the infection.In a case of sexual partners both of you need to be treated at the same time.When treating it with the creams, you must make sure that the entire surface of the penis and scrotum are covered. If uncircumcised, retract the foreskin and cover the complete surface, return the foreskin back the natural position and cover the rest of the penis.Partner must abstain frm sexual contact untill the infection has been resolved.All the best,Ron",

            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to yeast infection. The other possibility is of chafing skin. Oral course of antibiotics is needed. In addition, don\u2019t use any cosmetics on the penis, instead use some topical antimicrobials like Bacitracin or Lotrimin. Also corticosteroids and topical immunosuppressants can be used but they are available under prescription. Also retract the foreskin daily and soak in warm water to clean penis and foreskin. In case the symptoms persist then consult a urologist/dermatologist for evaluation and antimicrobials and steroids prescription.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
