I am borderline but im doing good and it was hard at first but then my body got used to the changes in food. Rather the gaining weight I have losed 23 lbs and im 29 wks tomorrow. I like to eat whole wheat bread with peanutbutter. my problem is the fasting morning sugar but as long as I eat protein before bed I am able to control it.
