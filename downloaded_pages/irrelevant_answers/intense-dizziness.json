            "answer": "Dizziness and nausea could be caused by low blood pressure, or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My mother had the same symptoms before she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0After her diagnoses it all kind of made sense. Especially the intense abdominal pain after having shared a large sprite with me at a movie.If your doctor did blood tests chances are he would know to include diabetes, especially with your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I would ask just to be sure...You can't be too careful.\u00a0\u00a0And get your blood pressure taken as well...Very low blood pressure can be as serious as high blood pressure.",
