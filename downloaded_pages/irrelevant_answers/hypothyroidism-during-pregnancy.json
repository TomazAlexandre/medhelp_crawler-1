            "answer": "Get on thyroid hormone, NOW! I have Hashimoto's hypothryodism. I gave birth to a preemie, and I wish docs would have tested my thyroid levels while I was pregnant. She is healthy now, but we were lucky. Hypothyroidism in the mother can cause miscarriage, premature delivery or developmental delays. My child did suffer developmental delays. We got her occupational and speech therapy. She is a normal six-year-old now, but those first few years were tough.Thyroid antibody tests are TGab and TPOab.I started at 50 mcg thyroid hormone and had no problems. 25 is a dose reserved for older people or children. They may want to start you at 25 because of your condition, but keep on those thryoid levels. Get your freesT3 and Ft4 in the upper 1/3 of the range. Don't let a doc treat your TSH. It is a pituitary hormone. Treating the frees is the most direct way of getting your thryoid hormones up.:) Tamra",

    "question": "Hi,I had undergone hemithyroidectomy on 8th October 2009 for a colloid goitre. My TFT was normal before surgery.I am currently in 6th week of pregnancy (My last menstrual period was 20th Nov 2009). I repeated TFT on 21 Dec 2009,. In that, TSH was 6.95 (normal range 0.465-4.68 mIU/mL); Free T4 was 11.8 (normal range 10-28.2 pmol/L); Total T3 was 1.56 (normal range 1.1-3.1 nmol/L) and Total T4 was 69.7 (normal range 55-160 nmol/L).I would like a suggestion regarding whether to start thyroxine supplementation and if so which dose to start with ? (I have a history of high blood pressure in the past, but now ok).Thyroid antibodies were not prior and after surgery. Do you suggest that I do it? and how does it affect the baby?Thanks,shazra*cross posted in pregnancy forum",
