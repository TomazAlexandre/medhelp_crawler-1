            "answer": "HiyaThanks for your reply. To answer your questions I take two 500mg metformine a day. My glucose level is anywhere between 5-7( finger *****) normally. I've been diabetic for about 5yrs now. We ALL procrastinate to an extent about making doctor's appointments that\"s just never a fun thing. surrounding work and school i simply have not gotten around\u00a0\u00a0to it, so that's my excuse! Of course I possibly could have other underlying issues surrounding the experienced numbness I never ruled that out that's why I brought my question here to see if someone else could of had a similiar problem. I've had blood work done recently there were no vitamin dificiencies. Salt ( I don' really use that much it could be just a small sprinkle)could be possibly the culprit to my problem I do notice when I have it I'm awake more often",

    "question": "I'm a 35yr female and I have type 2 diabetes..My sugar level is pretty much under control but for the past 6 months or so when sleeping my fingers/hands fall asleep also. It feels like pins and needles and I must wake up and shake them out just for them to feel normal again. I am constantly cold! 19 degrees cel. is not warm enough for me and I am constantly sleeping in fleeces and other warm clothing. I was wondering if anyone else had this problem and whats your take on it? I'm thinking of making a doc's appointment...I already know what he is going to say...Excercise.",
