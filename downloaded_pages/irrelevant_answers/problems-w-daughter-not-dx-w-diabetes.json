            "answer": "Hi anniemack,First, I must give the usual disclaimer: I am the mom of a diabetic teen, not a doctor. Your daughter's symptoms sound complicated and frustrating, and I understand your worries.As for the question about \"normal\" people have blood-glucose readings of 200 or higher, no, those numbers are higher than normal. They're not as high as those of a typical newly diagnosed type-1 diabetic though. My daughter was at 450 when she was diagnosed at 14, and I know some who were 600, 800 or worse.Something is going on, but it might not be diabetes. If it were diabetes, she would be very thirsty and urinating a lot, and losing weight. It doesn't sound like she has all the classic symptoms. As for what else her symptoms might mean, I couldn't guess, because diabetes is all I deal with. Hopefully the endocrinologist will get you some answers and some treatment. Hang in there... I'm sure she'll get better.",

            "answer": "Has she seen a gastroenterologist? A number of the symptoms you mention can be associated with inflammatory bowel disease (ulcerative colitis or Crohn's disease), including cessation of growth, susceptibility to infection, stomach pains, discomfort in eating, and constipation or diarrhea (or both). Just a thought. I hope you find the answer soon.",

    "question": "My 13 y/o daughter has had lots of health problems during the last several months (frequent infections, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0We are currently waiting to see an endocrinologist in mid. Nov. but she has had some metabolic tests run recently just trying to figure out what is going on with her.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing completely out of the norm but our pediatrician suggested we might want to track her blood glucose levels w/ an at home meter.Her levels are completely normal (+/- 100) for a few days and then will be in the mid to upper 100's off and on for a couple.\u00a0\u00a0She has GERD and sometimes will go without a bowel movement for a couple of days.\u00a0\u00a0This has happened several times recently...she'll eat a large meal, before she's finished she says she doesn't feel well, wants to lie down, stomach hurts, headaches, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes she'll vomit a little or have diarrhea issues.\u00a0\u00a0Tonight it happened and so I took a reading and first it came back @ 201, I had her get up, wash her hands and I took it again and it was @ 210 (30 - 45 min. after eating).\u00a0\u00a0Can normal people get readings like that?\u00a0\u00a0Also, another problem we've had this year is that she has stopped growing and she hasn't even begun any signs of puberty.\u00a0\u00a0 Are any of you familiar with these types of symptoms?This stuff is driving me and my husband crazy.\u00a0\u00a0We hate to see her feeling so badly and would love to have some insight until we can get in to see the Dr.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you,",
