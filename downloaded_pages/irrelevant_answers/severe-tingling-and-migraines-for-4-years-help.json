            "answer": "What kind of insect were you bitten by? Do you recall what it looks like?Lyme disease was the first thing that came to mind, and it's important that you know that it's a clinical diagnosis--i.e. you can test negative for it, yet still have the disease (this typically occurs in the very late stages of the disease, from what I understand). You might want to bring this up to your GP.This might be way out in left field, but have you looked into 'visceral leishmaniasis'? They're caused by sand-fly bites. I'm not sure if you live in an area that has sand flies anywhere nearby, but I figured it couldn't hurt to suggest this. What kind of parasites have they tested you for? Have you looked into toxoplasmosis?Good luck, and I hope you figure out what you have soon. It sounds like whatever you have is causing some neurological degeneration, so I hope you start to feel better soon!",
