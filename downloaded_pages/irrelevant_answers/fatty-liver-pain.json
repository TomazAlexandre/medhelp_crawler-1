            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Your symptoms of fatigue and pain could be due to fatty changes in the liver. Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding alcohol and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I have had this pain that everyone has been talking about for a few years now. I also get nausea frequently and recently I am extremely tired. I had my gallbladder removed 1 1/2 years ago and 6 mos ago I had my ovaries removed. I feel like I am running out of things to remove and the pain is getting more frequent. I also feel it more at night and I try to get energy to walk as my Dr said I need to lose another 20 lbs in hopes that my liver function will reverse. But after the removal of my ovaries I lost 30 lbs and my liver function got worse. 4 years ago I never even had high BP and now I have High BP, Diabetes, high Triglycerides and no energy. please let me know if losing the weight helped any of you. I am at a loss right now.This discussion is related to/posts/Gastroenterology---Digestive-Disorders/Fatty-liver-and-pain-in-upper-right-quadrant/show/234038.",
