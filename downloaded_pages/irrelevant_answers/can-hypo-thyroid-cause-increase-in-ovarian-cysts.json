    "question": "I am in the stage of my hypothyroid originally started on 50mcg synthroid TSH was 5.8/5.9 symptoms of hair loss/brain fog,etc., they cut the dose in half b/c TSH showed .226 but my symptoms are as bad as ever and the mind fog is worse. I am also experiencing an increase in my ovarian cysts..so..can my levels being in such a zig/zag have the effect of messing with my menstral cycle, spotting from ovulation til day 20, then heavy cycle days 20-28. and aggrivating my ovarian cysts?Thanks in Advance",
