            "answer": "I'm pretty much in the same boat I work in a nursing home and its 12 hour shift so alot of heavy lifting and very long hours on your feet and walking. I went into labor at 27+8 luckily they were able to stop it shortly after I found out I had gestational diabetes meaning i have to watch my sugar see a diabetes councillor and doing non stress test twice a week so my husband suggested me going prn (working my own schedule when they need me) well I talked to my boss and told her I still wanted to do two days a week (I only worked three) but because of all the appointments it would be easier to go prn and work mainly weekends she was happy because we are ALWAYS short on weekends but since then she hasn't called or txt me needing me to work and when I call or txt she waits all day to call or txt back and says she's already filled the schedule come to find out they have been working short and she's begging people to come in even the days I ask her to let me work!!! I am livid so today I confronted her through txt told her I was going to call corporate because I do my job when I'm there and its discrimination because I'm pregnant she txt me said she was getting ready to txt and see if I could work the weekend lol",

            "answer": "Luckily mine isn't my boss giving me trouble its my Co workers. I went in today and just told my boss I can't work in one of my houses because of the lies and back stabbing going on. She was like I knew this was coming and I understand. If you knew it was coming then talk to the other ladies about their lies! But no. Instead I look like the bad guy and left my clients.The other family I work for has been amazing about everything. They are like my own family I've worked with their son for 6 years. And I'm grateful to still have them on my work load.\u00a0\u00a0And they are my next door neighbors! Lol so it's nice just to walk next door and be at work.",

    "question": "Does anyone else have work issues due to your pregnancy? I am a home health aid for people with mental and physical disabilities. I work in two different homes. One of which has three clients living there.. meaning there are like 6 females all working in this one home. I am 20 weeks pregnant with my first and there is another woman that works in this home who is trying TTC with her third. Well we were pretty close and recently she has started making things hard at work. I was working 70 hours a week until finding out I was pregnant. My boss decided to take me off weekends to give me a break that I really needed. This upset everyone. Even though no one understands that I work another house as well.. to the point they pushed me out of the house I was working. So now I'm only working like 23 hours a week..I'm so frustrated",
