    "question": "I have a 9 year old son that has a history of fainting spells.\u00a0\u00a0They started when he was 5, when he passed out cold while in a store.\u00a0\u00a0He gets very clammy, but says he is hot and cold at the same time, and he says that he can tell when it's going to happen now because his his stomach gets queasy, and he feels shaky.We have told him that when he feels this way, to sit or lay down immediately, no matter if it is on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0We have tried to tell him that it is better to sit down than to fall down, especially if he can feel it coming on.I am a fainter myself, having had this same problem all my life (I've passed out cold around 6 times)...I never considered myself as anything other than just a fainter since my grandmother had the same issues, but now that it is happening to my son, I am so worried.\u00a0\u00a0We took him to Children's Hospital a year ago, and they ran tests for blood, brain, heart, epileptic attacks, all came back normal...but he still faints.\u00a0\u00a0We watched everything, including his diet, and the last episode happened yesterday. He had eaten a full breakfast about 1 1/2 hours before, and was getting a haircut when he said he was going to fall out of the chair, and he felt sick.\u00a0\u00a0He had eaten no sugar at all yesterday prior to this happening...could this be hypoglycemia?\u00a0\u00a0We are going to the clinic tomorrow...HELP!!",
