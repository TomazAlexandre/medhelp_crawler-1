            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The smell could be due to too much sulfite consumption. There are some bacteria in the gut that produce hydrogen sulfide gas. This gas has a smell of rotten eggs. You can test its presence by urine test strips available OTC. Most of this gas comes from sulfites a person consumes, which is a part of all preservatives. Sulfites are present in all juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough.If you have been taking these things in a good amount, then cut down the intake. Also take a lactobacillus preparation and yoghurt with your meals. In all probability the smell will go. If it persists, then talk to your doctor.The other possibility is uncontrolled diabetes mellitus. Certain drugs like antidepressants and thyroid disorders too can cause the smell.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
