Are you taking Lactulose and Rifaximin for hepatic encephalopathy? Assuming you also suffer from portal hypertension. Subtle signs of hepatic encephalopathy are observed in nearly 70% of patients with cirrhosis. If you are having trouble with the ability to concentrate, shortened attention span, changes in memory, intellectual function, hypersomnia, slowing of ability to perform mental tasks, insomnia, or inversion of sleep pattern, and coordination. This can also affect your energy level and ability to work.I hope someone else here can help you with the work issue you are facing.Best of luck with your discrimination case.Hectorsf",

            "answer": "Lil, Before you can get any protection you have to register your complaint with the Department of health and human services, then you have to file a complaint with department of civil rights, then you file with D.O.L.equal employment opportunities,then you file with the D.O.L.under the heading of americans with disabilities act.At that point you can get a U.S. attorney that specializes in labor law that will take your case.But if you still have hcv then you have a blood born pathogen and you are sticking you hands in peoples mouths.Best chance of keeping a job is to transfer out of dentistry. Remember though you work for the government and they make their own rules.If they don't want to abide by a law, they are not going to do it, and there is nothing you can do about it.",

    "question": "I am currently a dentist who works for the federal government.\u00a0\u00a0Since 1979, with the exception of a period of approximately 17 months, I have worked for the federal government either as an active duty military or civilian dentist, thus nearly 30 years total.\u00a0\u00a0I am in my 26th year as a dentist in this agency and my career has been almost exclusively clinical dentistry involving patient treatment.\u00a0\u00a0In 2002, following one of many \"needlestick\" incidents, I was diagnosed with Hepatitis C.\u00a0\u00a0I was successfully treated by my primary care provider.At this point, I find the fatigue of the cirrhosis involved as well as the type 2 diabetes to pose a problem with fatigue in terms of doing the involved dentistry my supervisor considers important.\u00a0\u00a0He is aware of my situation with Hepatitis C but is pursuing a formal process to have me fired.I will need an attorney to approach this situation.\u00a0\u00a0Retirement under FERS yields me very little compensation for\u00a0\u00a0the illness, discrimination, and mental anguish I have suffered for the past 8-12 years.\u00a0\u00a0Does anybody know of any cases of this type in the recent past and how it was handled?\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone suggest an aggressive attorney who might help me with the federal government's own discimination efforts against me?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you![",
