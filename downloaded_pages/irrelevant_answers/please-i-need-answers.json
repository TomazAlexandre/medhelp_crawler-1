            "answer": "Hello,Very sorry to know that your husband is suffering from so many problems, and you as his caretaker are probably suffering along with him.As he has so many problems, it is difficult for him to completely recover from all of the problems, or even to recover from even one of them completely. With so many problems, it may be difficult for you to manage alone with him. You might want to think of hospice care or of care at home with the help of trained nursing staff, if money is not a constraint.Caretakers of persons with chronic diseases become depressed and start developing diseases of their own. There is probably going to be no sudden change that is going totake place in your husband's situation. I suggest that you take care of yourself. Though this may seem heartless, this is the practical aspect.Regards",
