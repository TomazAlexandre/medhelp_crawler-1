    "question": "Hi i am a 13 year old girl who has had severe headaches for a year now. There has been many strange symtoms that docters can not explain. When you put it all together i have severe headaches, severe fatique, generalized weakness, High heart rate, and a slightly elevated blood pressure, very much affected by cold. I also got a cold a little bit earliear in the year so they put me on antibiotics, but it kept coming back. I was on three rounds of antibiotics. It still hasn't gone away i have been on nasenex since then to control it. Docters have noted i have a 2.5 cm retention cyst in my sinuises. About a month ago i had a extremely severe headache for three weeks, i literaly could not get out of bed, because when ever i sat up i was in a extreme amount of pain. Recently one of my docters have mentioned it could be adrenal related. I have an appointment later in the month, but i just wanted any ideas u can come up with. thank you very much!",
