            "answer": "To Tippy:I'd be very grateful if you'd post the high blood pressure meds Vertex says not to take.To BB:I'm as frustrated as you about the connection between high blood pressure and tx.There really isn't a lot of information out there and few people here seem to have this 'side effect'. Many people may not monitor their pressure and wouldn't be aware of fluctuations. Or it may simply be uncommon.I went from normal blood pressure before tx to continually increased doses, still with no success.Before tx, all my techniques to control pressure without meds worked well. On tx, nothing works (so far not even the meds).I have very elevated diastolic (resting) pressure, like you. Yours is high, at 102, and that's what I'm running into, even on meds. (The current ideal is 115/75.) My problem is that the meds send my systolic plummeting to 100, making me feel faint, but so far are ineffective for my diastolic. Bummer. It's tricky for the doc to sort out.As you said, high blood pressure is serious when left untreated. It insidiously and slowly does damage that can have fatal consequences.Treating it, though, can be a pain in the arteries.I'd recommend taking the pills. I hope this is only temporary for both of us. Which ones did your trial nurse approve?And congratulations on your UND at TWO weeks. That's huge, wonderful news. Do you know how many weeks you'll be treating altogether?",

Clinical guidelines in Great Britain, (but not the US), call for avoiding diuretics and beta-blockers as first-line treatment of hypertension due to the risk of diabetes.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beta_blockerI certainly wouldn't want to try a beta blocker during treatment when developing IR/Diabetes can make you fail.Do you know what Metformin, ACE inhibitors, and statins have in common?\u00a0\u00a0They're anti-oxidants.\u00a0\u00a0That's why all of them can prevent diabetes.This is one of my favorite articles.

            "answer": "Yes, somewhat the opposite in the U.S. where diuretics have received recent press with study backing as the most effective first-line rx treatment for high bp. For example, my internist suggest hydrochlorothiazide to start with, that being a very common diuretic. On the other hand, my cardio likes the Ace Inhibitors to start. And to add to the confusion, my tx doc liked the combo treatments like Hyzzar which combine the angiotensin II receptor Losartan with the diruetic\u00a0\u00a0hydrochlorothiazide.All this left me one very confused guy\u00a0\u00a0:) and lately I've been experimenting with both losartan and\u00a0\u00a0hydrochlorothiazide either solo or in combination to see what actually works as no sense taking a combo like Hyzaar if one drug is simply going along for a free ride without benefit. I have yet to try an Ace Inhibitor but hear they have more side effects (dry throat and coughing for example) than an angiotensin II receptor like Cozaar.Any more suggestions here would be welcome because while I'm confused, maybe if I get more confused I will then see some clarity.-- Jim",

            "answer": "Promote Heart HealthAvocados contain oleic acid, a monounsaturated fat that may help to lower cholesterol. In one study of people with moderately high cholesterol levels, individuals who ate a diet high in avocados showed clear health improvements. After seven days on the diet that included avocados, they had significant decreases in total cholesterol and LDL cholesterol, along with an 11% increase in health promoting HDL cholesterol.Avocados are a good source of potassium, a mineral that helps regulate blood pressure. Adequate intake of potassium can help to guard against circulatory diseases, like high blood pressure, heart disease or stroke. In fact, the U.S. Food and Drug Association has authorized a health claim that states: \"Diets containing foods that are good sources of potassium and low in sodium may reduce the risk of high blood pressure and stroke.\"One cup of avocado has 23% of the Daily Value for folate, a nutrient important for heart health. To determine the relationship between folate intake and heart disease, researchers followed over 80,000 women for 14 years using dietary questionnaires. They found that women who had higher intakes of dietary folate had a 55% lower risk of having heart attacks or fatal heart disease. Another study showed that individuals who consume folate-rich diets have a much lower risk of cardiovascular disease or stroke than those who do not consume as much of this vital nutrient.http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=foodspice&dbid=5",

            "answer": "Dear Co:I hope BB has a chance to read your post and then discusses the betablocker with his doctor, who prescribed it to be taken during tx. There may be a valid reason for this class of drug during tx but the NP is likely unaware of the IR risk.\u00a0\u00a0I'd love to hear back from BB about the doctor's reason. Maybe it's a balancing act. (Please don't laugh.)I know beta-blockers are out of fashion, except under the table for performance anxiety, so thank you very much for sending me great information that confirms this. Still, it's important to say again that my mom took it successfully for at least thirty years. She didn't develop diabetes or have cardiac events.Jim:My ACE may be a beauty of a drug by all accounts but it ain't bringing down my isolated diastolic during tx. Nonetheless, I love what I read about the 'magic' ACE and don't mind taking it. I prefer it to an ARB, which hasn't been studied as long. There was some very bad press about it recently (I'm linkless today) in combination with ACE.I\u00a0\u00a0briefly had a dry cough but nobody who's done tx would likely give it a second thought. It was tolerable and temporary.Rocker:I love avocados, always have, except for when I overdosed on them and couldn't bear to have them in sight. Avocados aren't enough, though, sorry to say.",

I've read a diuretic can amplify the effects of the ACE but maybe it's just additive.Of course it your ACE isn't doing its job then you have to change, what will be your next drug of choice?--------",
