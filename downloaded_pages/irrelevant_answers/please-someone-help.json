            "answer": "Oh yes! I can have the anxiety without the racing heart. It all depends on what your anxiety wants to do at that moment. A panic attack gives me a racing heart. Believe it or not I had one last night. It was my first panic attack in a while. Got really nervous, don't know why. My heart started racing and the more I worried the faster it got. My regular anxiety I can have all the time pins and needles through out body and other symptoms, but no racing heart. Panic/Anxiety does whatever it wants when it wants, until we can learn how to control it. I have gotten better, but still have a while to go to get back to my normal self.",
