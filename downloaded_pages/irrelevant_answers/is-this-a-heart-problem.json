            "answer": "Thanks for your response! Actually, I am experiencing these symptoms all the time, not episodically. My hands and feet are always slightly blue and splotchy, they just get much worse when I stand for more than a few minutes or exercise. I do feel short of breath, and I am lightheaded 24/7. Do you happen to know of any conditions that can cause these symptoms?Thanks again!",

    "question": "I am a 15 year old boy who has been dealing with chronically cold hands and feet, debilitating fatigue, and increase of symptoms after eating.After standing for a few minutes, my hands and feet become a dark shade of blue, and are very cold. My lower legs become incredibly itchy. However, I do not experience an increase in fatigue while standing up.I have been tested for autoimmune disorders, thyroid problems, infectious diseases, diabetes/hypoglycemia, and many other diseases/conditions. I have been misdiagnosed multiple times in the past.I am 100% percent sure that my symptoms are circulatory related. It seems that something is preventing enough blood to reach my brain and lower extremities, causing these symptoms.What disorders would cause my hands and feet to become dark blue and itchy like that? Maybe something related to my heart?THANKS!",
