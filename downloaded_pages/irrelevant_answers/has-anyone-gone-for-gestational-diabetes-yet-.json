            "answer": "Keep in mind that like waitn838 said, there is a high chance that your 3 hour test will be just fine.\u00a0\u00a0Many women come up borderline on the 1 hour test and then turn out to be fine on the 3 hour one.I go for my test in two weeks - the head of my OB department specializes in gestational diabetes and she recommends everyone be tested around 24-26 weeks (earlier than the standard 28 weeks) - that way, if GD is identified, you have more time to get blood sugars stabilized and help the fetus.\u00a0\u00a0So, in the worst case scenario, if it is GD, you have plenty of time to work on it and your baby will be just fine.",

            "answer": "I had mine this past Monday! The drink was horrible...wish I could have had jelly beans. I gagged the whole time I was drinking it bc I had to drink it within 5 minutes! The dr told me she would call if I had it and I never got a call back, so I guess I'm in the clear. She scared me though bc she said twin pregnancies usually cause it. Good luck to everyone who still has to take it.",

            "answer": "I haven't had one this time around and won't because I've been treated as if I have it to start off with.\u00a0\u00a0I have PCOS and my insulin levels are really high to start off with - have been pre-diabetic for about 7 years now due to it.While pg with DD I was on metformin thru 13 weeks, then took 3 hour test and passed....wait until 28 weeks or so, took 3 hour test again (doc was sure I'd fail 1 hour, so didn't bother with that) and of course I failed.\u00a0\u00a0I tried some diet but ended up on Glyburide by about 32 weeks.This time around, I was on Metformin thru 13 weeks and instead of stopping, switched to Glyburide right away to see if we could maintain levels throughout pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0So far my sugars are good with the meds and I'm not spilling so no need to up my dosage yet (I'm on lowest dosage).\u00a0\u00a0I'm high risk due to this and AMA so I'm having u/s every 4-6 weeks.....DS is measuring a little big so far, but not scarey big.\u00a0\u00a0Perinatologist just says to continue to monitor and see how things go and expects that I'll have to up my dose at some point.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping not to, but we will see!\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could control it without meds, but have such a hard time with it even not pregnant....pregnant makes it 100 times harder!",

    "question": "Hey ladies hope everyone is feeling well!Yesterday I went in for my gestational diabetes test, my doc. sent me in early because I am measuring a little big.Well I got the phone call this morning and I am boarder line! Im so upset, I spent the night in the ER with my son because he said he had eaten a battery and then I get this call!? (He didnt eat a battery, he has been telling a lot of stories lately)I have been reading about it all morning and Im a little confused, I am over weight even before the pregnancy but I have only gained 5-6 lbs and I am 23 weeks. The only thing I cant think of is that I have been eating a lot of home baked goods (cookies and treats) but that is it. I really dont have anything else they list for being at risk. It said that if you gain to much weight to fast that can cause it among other things....I guess I'll deal with it but I have been fighting tears all morning!Anyone else have gestational diabetes or had it before??",
