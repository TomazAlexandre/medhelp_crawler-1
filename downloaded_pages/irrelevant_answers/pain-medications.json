It helps dramatically, just leaves a rash on my skin due to a adhesive allergy i have, but DEF go for Butrans.",

    "question": "Hello, I am a 56 year old female with Fibromyalga, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, Diabetes and Microvascular Disease.\u00a0\u00a0I currently take Gabapentin, Verapamil, Potassium, Lasix, Metformin, Talwin, and Amrix. I used to take Hydrocodone for back pain and overall pain from the Fibromyalgia. But I developed an allergy to it. So, my doctor switched me to Talwin, which works ok. No allergy to it. We had recently moved and I had to find a new pain doctor. I had shots in my lower back for pain and they gave me Tramadol. However, they had previously prescribed a Butran patch for me and I had trouble getting approval from my insurance company, so I just stayed with the Talwin. I have recently read up on the Butran patch and taking it makes me nervous. I am wondering which of the 3 medications (Talwin, Butran Patch, or Tramadol) would be best with the other medications that I take. I also take aspirin and Zyrtec OTC.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for any help.",
