            "answer": "Thank you for your help. I have scheduled an appointment for a well-child check-up with my son's pedatrician for the day after Thanksgiving. I have checked his sugar a few times since my last post and all the levels have been in the normal range. I think I am going to lay off pricking his fingers (he hates it). And keep a close watch on him. I have also instructed his grandparents not to fill him up on cookies, candies and other carbs when he goes to their house. I may have gotten carried away. He is our only child and the light of our lives. I guess sometimes we can be overprotective of the things we hold so dear. Thanks again for your help.",

            "answer": "I understand completely.\u00a0\u00a0I am a Type II also.\u00a0\u00a0Occasionally I will check my kids blood sugar if they are acting strange.\u00a0\u00a0A few months ago my 15-year old son passed out for reason - just crumpled to the floor while standing in the kitchen.\u00a0\u00a0I grabbed my glucose meter and checked - he was around 115 (looking back I probably just caught it as it was crashing).\u00a0\u00a0Last month my son and I came back from a family birthday party (cake, ice cream, pizza) and my son went into his room.\u00a0\u00a0He grabbed a Mountain Dew and took *ONE* swallow.\u00a0\u00a0He said he was really dizzy and getting tired.\u00a0\u00a0I grabbed my glucose meter - he was a 262.Me doesn't urinate frequently but is constantly hungry and thirsty (hey, he's 15!).\u00a0\u00a0I just saw an endocrinologist with him this afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest you talk to your son's pediatrician and ask his/her opinion.\u00a0\u00a0My son's pediatrician agreed, 262 was scary - we got a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Today we met with him and he said to just monitor the glucose levels and maintain a good diet.\u00a0\u00a0Come back either in two months for another A1C (his was 5.1) to see if there is any progression.\u00a0\u00a0However, if we get more than 2-3 readings of over 220 get in immediately.\u00a0\u00a0We are all sure my son is in the early stages of Type I but his pancreas is still hanging in there.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing will slow it down or speed it up, we just have to be ready when it gives into the diabetes.I haven't dealt personally with Type I before.\u00a0\u00a0My entire family is Type II.\u00a0\u00a0These are two completely different diseases.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that is is GOOD that your son's glucose levels dropped to normal so soon and stayed there (mine will dip into the 70s). Talk to your pediatrician and see if it is a concern or if (like me) you're just very cautious because you are living with it too.",

    "question": "I am a type two diabetic. I check the blood glucose levels of my four year old son with my meter often. The levels have always been good. The other night however he ate a lot of his Halloween candy and I check his sugar a couple of hours after he had eaten it and his BG level was 159. This really worried me because his sugar levels had never been this high. I checked again in thirty minutes and it was 133. I checked it again in two hours and it was 106. I checked it the next morning and it was 95. The following night after dinner it was 106 and tody after eating a pancake with syrup for breakfast, and drinking a juice box and eating some other carbs his sugar level was 105. Would a lot of candy cause sugar levels to go up to 159 in a non-diabetic? He hasn't been urinating more than usual and not excessively thirsty. I am just so afraid of him having to go through the insulin shots.",
