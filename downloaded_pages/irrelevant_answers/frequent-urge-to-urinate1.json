    "question": "Hello. For the last couple of days I have not been able to sleep because I have to wake up 2 to 3 time a night to use the bathroom and during the day, especially when I am sitting I feel the urge to pee. I have no burning and when I got I do not feel like I need to go more but after a few minutes I feel like I need to go again. It started when I was on my period but I don't know if that'd just a coincidence or not. I'm going to the doctor in 2 days but I was wondering if anyone else has had this problem. And I am a 22 yr old female.",
