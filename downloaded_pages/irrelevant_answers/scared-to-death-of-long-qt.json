    "question": "So I\u2019ve been on a real rollercoaster here. Please excuse the length. I could really use some support. This is two posts I put up in a different group but it\u2019s my story so far.I was recently in the ER due to shortness of breath that was determined to be from asthma. They did an EKG which showed a prolonged qtc of 515 ms.I\u2019ve had many health issues this past year and have had 30 EKGs, event monitor, and holter monitors, two stress tests. Only two EKGs show this prolonged QT.Since many of you are already diagnosed, is this something I should be worried about? I\u2019m terrified of just dropping dead.I\u2019ve never passed out and had two perfectly normal stress tests.UPDATE: so my cardiologist said that my qt interval was slightly prolonged \u2014 it was qtc 515, but he must have gotten a different reading by hand. I\u2019m assuming so anyway \u2014 which he believes is benign in nature due to all the other EKGs being okay.He told me to come in and get another EKG so he could look at it. It came back\u00a0\u00a0 442.Still waiting to hear back for analysis.I looked at all my other numbers on all my other tests and all but those two my qt numbers are in the 420s or 30s, all depending on my heart rate.Could this be because of my dysautonomia? My Autonomic system is stuck in the \u201con\u201d position and so I get a lot of adrenaline.I\u2019m still anxious as hell over this. But I\u2019ve never had any issues so this is so strange. No family history of anyone suddenly dropping dead, no one dead under 50 for any reason. Hell my great grandparents on my dad\u2019s side lived into their 80s and so did most of their kids. My grandma is still alive.On my Mom side diabetes took my grandma in her sixties but she didn\u2019t take good care of herself either. My grandpa died of a heart attack. Again every overweight and all manner of bad habits.I just don\u2019t get the random prolongation. No history, no fainting, no problems running around, being active, exercising, nothing.Then I took to constant dizziness that never goes away, heart palpitations on occasion, skipped beats, migraines, asthma, ect.Showed autonomic dysfunction on my tilt table. I have diabetes that\u2019s well under control through meds and diet.I\u2019m baffled and scared to death.",
