            "answer": "hi, this probly wont be of much help, but i know that a fever is usually a good indication of an infection. low back pain with it could mean an infection somewhere in the back? like maybe a kidney infection, although you would have sharp side pain with that as well. being tired could very well go along with infection also because it could take a lot out of someones body to go through it for a long period of time. The new meds might be a possibility of the fatigue as well, have you done research on the meds? my best wishes! hope you get well soon!",
