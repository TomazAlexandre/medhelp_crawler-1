            "answer": "This happened to me as well the dr just put me on lyrica- 75 am and pm and 50 at noon and it has all but stopped. The rheumatologist says it is a symptom of Fibromyalgia and prediabetes. Who knows? Gp also gave me Vistaril to sleep. Good luck to you. My drs just have the state of mind to mask or stop the symptoms, I have little insurance and cannot afford the MRI's and such- I just get the sample pills and am sent on my way. I am female and 48. blessings. DrV3",

How does the body turn stress into pinched-nerve-like effects of numbness in limbs and face?\u00a0\u00a0And I do wonder: is there ANY human being not under multiple and sometimes overwhelming stresses?\u00a0\u00a0But oh, how I hope I am simply an overstressed one.gonewiththewind, New York",
