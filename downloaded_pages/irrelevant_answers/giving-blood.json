            "answer": "Surfin' USA:i use the VA also but diabetes has always been something they won't let diabetics do. Of course, i'm no Doctor, just another Type 1 diabetic. i can't even tell you about Type 2 diabetics (i'm sorry i referred to people with diabetes as diabetics because there are those who take offense with this saying you are treating them like diabetes is the only important thing in their lives. i refer to myself that way and don't think of it in terms of giving or taking offense. Please accept my apology if you were offended.)The way i had it explained: is that even with the best control there are going to be moments when there is too much insulin or sugar present in the blood affecting the person getting the blood.That was many years ago i was told that, about 20 or so years.i do agree with the comments in that you've got to do some work on reducing your A1C number. Don't take me wrong, Lord knows i've not always been perfect. But start to read a little more about accepted diabetes care and start to work towards that. Don't try to do everything at once. If you do it in steps it won't seem like such a difficult task.i have even taken steps to improve my diabetes control since starting at this forum, because i felt i couldn't tell someone else to get good control if i weren't doing the same. But it did it in small steps, tackling those things that have the worst affect on blood sugars. Like when sitting down to a meal instead of thinking they can't tell me how to eat and then doing what i felt, though i know eating even too much of a good thing is bad. So i went little bits at a time.good luck, bret",

    "question": "Its me again..doing much better in terms of coping with the D, although my a1c has gone up(8.1) just glad it wasn't worse. Resolved to work harder on my diabetes this next year( funny how that is always a resolution of mine, come Jan.1!) Will complete Cozmo training next week- really looking forward to it! Anyway, my post this evening is somewhat of another rant, I give blood frequently with the Red Cross/VA blood services and I wanted to do something differant, the whole blood donor guidelines are supposidly true for the other services. (in particular,apheresis donation)Apheresis is when they circulate/collect red blood cells through an IV line into a machine. Diabetes hasn't posed a problem with regular blood donations, and apheresis is supposed to be even quicker/more safe in terms of recovery.(2 days,and you've got back whatever you lost) So I signed up, over a month in advance- when I got there, went through the health history and then the tech tells me I can't give- why, because they run dextrose through the IV line. I was quite peeved, I could have easily adjusted for that with several extra units of insulin pumped in,but medical rules are written in stone. And I can understand why they do it, because most diabetics do not recieve very good training + making those adjustments would be significantly hazardous to their health. They said one day, they might change that rule but for now just live with it..Telling me I can't do something because of diabetes makes me all the more resolved to do it,wish more people in this world had some basic common sense.",
