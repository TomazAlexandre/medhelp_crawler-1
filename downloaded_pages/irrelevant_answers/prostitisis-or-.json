            "answer": "Hello,Since the burning sensations started after lifting heavy weights, it is most likely a neurological injury to the lower spine. This may cause a burning sensation, tingling or numbness in the genitalia, thighs, legs or feet.Hence to get it ruled out get a MRI lower spine done. The other possibility is of diabetic neuropathy, i.e. damage to the nerves due to the longstanding diabetes. The diagnosis is made usually by doing a detailed clinical evaluation and by a test called Nerve Conduction Velocity test. It makes sense to consult a neurologist for the same. Drugs like methylcobalamin along with pregabalin help in improving the pains.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

I have not had any leg issues since. I will still go see my Neurologist to make sure.\u00a0\u00a0I have had two diabetes tests, is this one you mentioned different?This is what still remains:- Pain when ejaculating about 30 minutes afterwards.- slight discomfort in groin areaThis could also still be from the spinal issue that will be checked out in August (earliest I could get in).",

    "question": "Hello,I have had an issue with burning sensations in the genital area, tip of penis. I will post a timeline and what has been done, so hopefully I explain this properly.- In May I was doing some heavy lifting in my garage and may have injured my lower back. My back doesn't always hurt, more of a just sore feeling. Right after this happened the tip of my penis felt like it was on fire. Erections were not happening, and if they do it doesn't last long. I went to a local urgent care facility and they tested my urin for infections. Test negative.I then went to my primary care Doctor. He inspected me and took a urin sample and tested for gonnorrhea and\u00a0\u00a0chlamydia, tests negative. He put me on a two week dose of ceproflaxin.This really didn't do anything. Warming feeling was also in genital, rectal areas too. Lower back felt warm too. Don't know if this is related, but bottom of feet felt sweaty and very hot, maybe tingling.- June I went to see an urologist and discussed my warm feeling and he asked if I had athlete foot. He was suggesting I brought up my athlete foot to my groin area. This could be since I have had really bad feet since the military. I seen a foot doctor and he did say I had some foot fungus. Started treatment for that. Used over the counter cream for feet and groin, even though it didn't look like I had jock itch. Seemed to get better.Well the burning sensation came back in my groin area, not on the tip of my penis this time. Still have a burning sensation in my feet at times. I went back to my primary doctor. He gave me a prostrate exam and said it felt normal. He had me do some blood tests for kidneys, liver, inflamation, PSA, diabeties, and my numbers came back great.- July I went back to my Uroligist. He gave me two more weeks of cepro. I got through most if it and had a reaction to the drugs. I'm not sure it was not anxiety. I have been spending too much time on webmd and freaking myself out. Dr said just to take some aleve twice a day. Well that didn't work and I had severe burning in groin area. I got some relief with bowel movements. Went back to Uroligist and he ordered a CAT scan for this coming Monday and stated that it sounded like I was just really inflamed in my groin area. He gave me a persciption for Naproxen for six months. This has helped a little.My primary care doctor also wants me to see an allergist and Neurologist specializing in back injuries. I see them in early August.So here are the symptoms as of today:- burning or warm groin and rectal area, comes and goes. There is also some burning in my lower back too if I sit wrong in a chair. Laying down I almost always have no issues.- feet, same thing and I would have to say they come at the same time. If I wear shoes and socks with no activity, feet get really sweaty and start getting warm. It does happen in flip flops too, just not as much. Been trying to keep up on washing my feet and applying anti fungal cream on feet and groin. With walking, usually doesn't happen.- my lower back still feels \"different\" than normal. Hopefully I didn't hurt it too bad.- ejaculations do not feel good. Urination has not ever been painfull. Bowel movements is a different story.So where do I go from here? I have only been on Naproxen a few days, so maybe give this some more time???Thank you for any experiences or advice.",
