            "answer": "sorry if I sound illogical or hypothetical.. but I wanted to share my experiences and beliefs...I am a believer in yoga and natural medicine.. The fact that our ENTIRE BODY was created out of a single cell when we were conceived in our mom's womb.. is proof enough that our body has an inherent capability and information about how to fix diseases... given a chance and a triggerI have seen natural/homeopathic medicine helping regrow bones which dissolved due to diabetes,\u00a0\u00a0cartilages and spinal disks which were damaged.. regeneration of liver, shrinkage of an enlarged aortic valve in the heart.. increased E/F ratio for cardiac patients.. and seen so many women get cured of gynac troubles.. I have myself seen the effect of these techniques on my fibroids, cysts and irregular cycles...In a nutshell..\u00a0\u00a0more than the allopathic medicines, it is prayer, belief, yoga and natural medicine that I believe in...Its worth the research :) Hope it helps you as well...",
