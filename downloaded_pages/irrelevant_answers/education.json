            "answer": "Hi,There truly are many resources out there, sometimes it can be a bit overwhelming. The best place to start really is by speaking with a certified diabetes educator. You can most often find them in hospitals or associated with Endocrinology clinics, and they are a wonderful resource for information on diabetes overall, and more specifics like diet, medications and general care/health maintenance. Some are better than others ofcourse, so ask around for recommendations from diabetes support groups.The American Diabetes Association has some good information on their website www.diabetes.org, including some downloadable information on diet and meal planning.\u00a0\u00a0This is a good starting point also.There are so many books out there that I cannot think of one off the top of my head. But the support /discussion boards on the ADA website may have groups discussing books, so check into those too.Take care.",
