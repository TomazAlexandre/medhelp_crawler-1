            "answer": "Welcome to the world of PCOS and TTC.\u00a0\u00a0I was also DX'd with PCOS at 26 and I did conceive on my first cycle of 50mg of clomid.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, that pregnancy was not successful for me, but don't let that discourage you.\u00a0\u00a0The best thing I can recommend is to do your homework.\u00a0\u00a0I luckily had a very aggressive OB and when she DX'd me with PCOS, she immediately set me up for ovarian drilling and put me on metformin to help regulate my insulin (a very common problem with PCOS).\u00a0\u00a0Clomid itself is not an actual fertility drug, it is an ovulation drug - something I didn't learn until later on in my journey.\u00a0\u00a0If you have PCOS, simply ovulating may not solve the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely ask your doctor to check actual ovulation for you - or at the very least, start tracking your temperatures to see if ovulation even occured.\u00a0\u00a0Something both my OB and my RE told me, later ovulation reduces the chance of conception - without medication, I normally ovulate around CD20 which is late.\u00a0\u00a0And this only happened after my laparoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0Before the ovarian drilling, I would go months without an actual period - thank goodness I now have one every 35-36 days.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to you and SSBD!!",

            "answer": "@Sheaby, I have taken metformine befor when I was about 19 I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. It was for the diabetes but I didnt respond well. It upset my system a lot. I myself will go severl months with gettin my cycle on my own then just stop for no reason. My dr decided to have me take a steriod when that happens. That is what I did this month. I started my period on the 18th and took my first dose of clomid on 12-22. My period is at an end. I sometimes can feel when I ovulate and also have a small plug of mucus. So I know I do ovulate. However my left tube has a small tear and causes early spillage. This is the first time I have taken clomid because the first time I have been really serious about having,a baby. I feel really good about this and confident. I never knew this many women share the same issue as myself. I felt alone for a long time. I have know about the pcos for years. I just never knew how big a part it plays in my conception and carrying full term. I have a better dr now so im prayin things will come out very different.",
