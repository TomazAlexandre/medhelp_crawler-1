            "answer": "Don't put any cider vinegar on.What you could try is apply Bicarbonate of Soda to your washed and gently dried area.\u00a0\u00a0Bicarbonate of Soda will help to reduce the\u00a0\u00a0moisture and the smell.If you feel that you are actually sweating a lot, you can purchase Odaban.What you need to do is to make yourself an appointment to see your doctor and to get a swab done from those areas that are bad.\u00a0\u00a0The swab should be sent to the laboratory to identify any bacteria or fungus.\u00a0\u00a0Once the results come back your doctor will be able to know how to treat you.Don't use any soap, bath and shower gels.\u00a0\u00a0You can try non perfumed soap, soap that has the same pH level as our skin and baby washes may be fine.Don't wear nylon or manmade garments.\u00a0\u00a0These make you sweat more.\u00a0\u00a0Wear cotton pants and trousers. These help your skin to breathe more.Get your clothes washed in non biological detergent and if you use fabric softeners, use the ones that are suitable for sensitive skin.What you eat and drink and how you empty your bowels, will also affect your odour.You can buy off the internet Epsom Salts and put 2 or 3 cups of it into your bath water and soak in that for 12 mins or more.\u00a0\u00a0You will get instructions on the pack or bucket which ever one you purchase.\u00a0\u00a0The Epsom Salts neutralise the pH level on our skin and bugs don't like this.\u00a0\u00a0If you do try the Epsom Salts, do put some baby oil or coconut oil into the bath water too, because the salts are very drying on their own.\u00a0\u00a0Epsom Salts contain magnesium and when bathing this is absorbed through the skin, which is a good thing.Don't forget to book an appointment and see your doctor.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately, as we age we do not produce enough natural oil, and that can make our skin itch as well as irritants, some illnesses and some medications.You have to be careful with steroid ointments as they thin the skin.I have never heard of parasthi, but will look it up now.I hope that you do not use normal soaps and avoid using biological washing detergents.Epsom Salts is supposed to be very good for lots of things.\u00a0\u00a0If you do try it Dalubaba, to soak your feet in a bowl even, do put some baby oil.\u00a0\u00a0Epsom Salts on their own is very drying to the skin.Coconut oil (the organic virgin one) is really good too.\u00a0\u00a0 It is antibacterial, antifungal, moisturising, you can cook with it, eat it.Have you had a check done for diabetes and your liver and kidney function?You don't need to answer that, it is just something to think about.",

            "answer": "Well there is no point eating food if you don't like it.Don't forget to book an appointment and get the doctor to take a swab to send to the laboratory to rule out any fungal problem.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes a fungal cream or a fungal spray needs to be used for quite a while.\u00a0\u00a0A doctor sometimes may prescribe antifungal medications to take by mouth.\u00a0\u00a0There are antifungal single dose capsule that you can purchase without a prescription from the pharmacy, but the doctor can prescribe stronger and a longer dose if it required.Don't forget to follow the advice I gave you in my first message.It would also be a good idea for you to ask your doctor to arrange for you to have a fasting glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0Skin problems in that area in between the legs that are persistent can be related to glucose intolerance, pre diabetes or diabetes.Do bear in mind too, that everyone has some odours.\u00a0\u00a0But as yours is very strong and you have that skin issue, you need an urgent appointment with your doctor.",

    "question": "Hi I've been having these god awful smell coming from my testicles or somewhere in the groin area and it has destroyed my life. I always have a strong ,very strong musky odor. Not even a minute after I come out of the shower I begin to smell it again, and yes I clean myself well. I would first use regular soap then moved onto anti-bacterial soap but it doesn't seem to work. I also used rubbing alcohol , antifungal spray, synalar cream, but I still haven't tried white apple cider vinegar. I always feel my testicles moist and sometimes itchy, but the worst problem is the smell. The smell and moist feeling has been around has been around since I've been a freshmen in high school and now I'm a senior in high school. I thought it would go away but it doesn't. I dry myself thoroughly and put powder to try to stay dry but it doesn't help. It has destroyed my social life. Everybody tries to avoid contact from me, even my teachers. I'm not overweight. I was pretty active I wrestled in high school and did tawekwondo, but stopped a couple months ago. I would go to a gym but it's too embarrassing because the odor is really strong. I have a rash between my thighs and my skin on my penis and testicles was peeling off. It was maybe because I was using alcohol, the antifungal spray, and baby powder and it was leaving my penis dry. Or I was masturbating without any lub or lion.\u00a0\u00a0Please help me I know there has to be something wrong down there.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not paranoid.\u00a0\u00a0It is seriously embarrassing, everybody that knows me looks at me with disgust even my family. Please help , thank you.",
