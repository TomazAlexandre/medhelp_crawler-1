            "answer": "What would help your mother is to manage her blood sugar. Her vision fading is probably caused by high blood glucose. Does she test her blood sugar regularly? If she is high than she needs to learn more about how to control her numbers with diet and exercise and perhaps talk to the doctor about changing her medications if they are not helping and having side effects. Yes, pot would help with her nausea, but more important than temporary relief of symptoms is getting to the bottom of what is causing them and controlling her blood sugar so she doesn't have further unpleasant complications. Complications from diabetes are not inevitable if blood sugar is well controlled by a combination of diet, exercise, medication and maintenance of healthy weight.",

            "answer": "I'm diabetic and I'd be afraid to us pot. When i did take it when younger all it did was make me sick. So I don't think something like this would work for everyone and in any case. It's best to have your mother talk to her doctor.Zoelula is absolutely correct in that she needs to know what her glucose levels are at right now and to know what levels she needs to be at. Diabetes doesn't go away or get better if you do not treat it. Masking it with a drug or narcotic will not help her situation.",
