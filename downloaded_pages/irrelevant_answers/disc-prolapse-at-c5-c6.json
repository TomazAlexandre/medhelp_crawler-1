            "answer": "Hi Umer, I understand your concern for your ailing father. Well there are two lines of thought. The compressive neuropathy needs to be relieved by discectomy at the affected levels to avoid compression of exiting nerve roots from these levels. However he being a diabetic can have delayed healing and other peripheral neuropathies as part of the disease like peripheral neuropathies. So the outcome would not be worth the risk. This is my contention. You can get an expert\u2019s opinion, a neurologist by posting in the expert forum. All the best and take care.",
