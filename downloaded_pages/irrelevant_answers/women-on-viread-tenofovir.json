            "answer": "are you on vitamin d supplements?vitamin d3 supplements are necessry to avoid bone and fat problems while on tdf, also diet is very importanti also noticed little fat gain when tdf was added to etv but since i reached bmi 21 with no fat at all it is easier to control it by vit d and diet.also monitor for fatty liver because this fat makes fatty liver too and this raises chances to get also all other fat related diseases like arterosclerosis, ictus, diabetes, cancer and so onkeeping an eye on levels of vit d3 (vitd25oh>50ng/ml), oxidatve stress blood tests all within normal, fresh vegetable diet rich of antioxidants you can balance all this and prevent all diseases",
