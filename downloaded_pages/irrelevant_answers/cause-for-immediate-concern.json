            "answer": "I haven't seen any association of BO or vertical ridges on nails with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone has some tartar buildup. If you want to get your blood sugar checked or hemoglobin A1C is a good test too then you can. I would do a general chemistry with a fasting blood sugar. I have vertical ridges on my thumbs as well and peeling fingernails and the peeling fingernails is due to being hypothyroid. So you might want to check your TSH level as well. Have you felt tired? The high blood pressure can change with going down on meat, and dairy products, no oil or fried foods and exercising more. If you are type 2 diabetic there is a diet that will reverse both of these but it is vegan and oil and fat free and takes a lot of work to get used to. You are young and may not think this will affect you but maybe watch the DVD forks over knives and see what you think.",

            "answer": "It is quite normal to get ridges in our fingernails as we age.\u00a0\u00a0They can also appear if you have had an injury to the nail bed.\u00a0\u00a0If the nails are yellow with the ridges, this is likely to be a fungal infection.Ridges in the nails with white patches can indicate psoriasis.Horizontal ridges on the fingernails are the ones to be concerned about.Like mkh89 says, anyone can get a build up of tar and this has nothing to do with having diabetes.You need to brush your teeth in the morning and before going to bed and also floss.\u00a0\u00a0Your hygienist will give you instruction how to brush your teeth effectively and also how to floss.\u00a0\u00a0You can also purchase little brushes in different thicknesses to fit in between your teeth too.If you are concerned about diabetes, the symptoms to look out for are: itchy skin, having wounds that are slow to heal, soreness and itchiness in the genital area and in between the inner thighs, thirst, feeling tired after eating, feeling ill if you miss a meal. Having an urgent need and going frequently to urinate can also be a sign of diabetes. (this can also be due to a urinary infection and also a prostate problem in men).\u00a0\u00a0 Sometimes, you may feel that you have loss of sensations in the skin (this is due to nerve damage).Putting a lot of weight around the belly area can also be a warning sign of diabetes (that is unless you have a bear belly!)An ophthalmologist would be able to tell if you are diabetic if there are any changes in the back of the eye, usually this is when damage has already been done to the retina.An HbA1C blood test gives the average glucose reading over a 9-12 week period.\u00a0\u00a0A glucose test would also show whether you are diabetic or not.For high blood pressure, it is the amount of salt that can increase the level of blood pressure and also if you get very stressed and anxious.\u00a0\u00a0Never take a blood pressure reading after drinking a cup of coffee or after exercise or rushing around otherwise the reading will be raised.\u00a0\u00a0The best time to take a reading is when you are relaxed.\u00a0\u00a0Don't talk whilst your blood pressure is being taken either.Our body does need a certain amount of the good fat to be able to function properly.\u00a0\u00a0Olive oil, fish oils, and oil from nuts are the good oils.\u00a0\u00a0It is the saturated fats and sugars that we need to avoid or keep to a minimum.\u00a0\u00a0And keep your salt to a minimum too - easier said than done, I know.\u00a0\u00a0I love lots of salt on certain foods.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",

    "question": "I have a doctors appointment set for March but I was wondering if anyone has had anything similar happen to them. I need to know if I can wait til March or if I need to go to the doctor now. I am a 25 year old male 6' 165lbs. never have had weight problems in my life. I have high blood pressure and a sudden increase in body odor under my arms only. I have never had the BO either. I have vertical ridges that have developed on my thumb nails and when I recently went to the dentist she found tartar under the gumline on the back of my teeth and she asked if I was a diabetic? This all may be several pieces leading to nothing but I was wondering if anyone has ever been through anything similar.",
