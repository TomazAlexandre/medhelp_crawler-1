Common causes causing erection problem are stress and anxiety, poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, which make sex a task rather than a pleasure, negative feelings about non performance,smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, spinal cord injury, nerve damage (for example, from prostate surgery), or neurologic disorders (such as multiple sclerosis or Parkinson's disease).Talk to your partner openly about any fears or apprehensions, eat nutritious healthy food, exercise regularly and cut down on smoking or alcohol if you are taking it.If still a problem then please get yourself evaluated for the medical conditions mentioned above.I sincerely hope that helps.

            "answer": "Hello,Obviously these symptoms have started after injuring the penis but it is also important to rule out other causes like infection (Epididymitis or Orchitis) or inflammation, testicular torsion( most common in young men), excessive bicycle riding, hernia, varicocele or kidney or ureteric stones.Lab investigations like complete blood examination, urine examination, ultrasound lower abdomen and genitalia and cystoscopy will help in diagnosis. Treatment will be started thereafter.My advise would be to consult a urologist.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",
