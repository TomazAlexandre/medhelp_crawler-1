            "answer": "I did mine today. They drew blood 4 times, once when you first get there and then once an hour every hour for 3 hours after you drink the drink. The stuff you have to drink this time is even harder to keep down than the 1 hour test bc it has twice the amount of sugar so its super sweet. I had to send my boyfriend to get me some ice chips. It helped me not feel so naseated. Hope all you ladies get good results!",

            "answer": "I wasn't feeling very good after the first hour so the hospital took me to a room where I could lay down on a hospital bed. It helped me get through the test otherwise I think I may have gotten sick and they said that if i got sick I would have to come back another day to take the test again I was not about to do that lol.",
