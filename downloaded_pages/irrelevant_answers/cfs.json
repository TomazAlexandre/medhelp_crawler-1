            "answer": "Actually, postie, many people with CFS *can* exercise, just not very much or at least significantly less than they used to.\u00a0\u00a0Most people find that exercising very lightly but regularly will improve their stamina marginally over time.Using myself as an example, I went from being able to walk 15 minutes without getting exhausted to being able to walk 20-25 minutes without getting exhausted...this took several months of walking the same route, occasionally adding a little bit on days when I felt a bit better.\u00a0\u00a0I also found that lifting weights was helpful for the weak, jittery feelings.\u00a0\u00a0But again, I had to keep it WAY less than what I would have before getting CFS and stop well before I felt tired.\u00a0\u00a0If I didn't, especially with the walking, I'd be exhausted and myalgic for at least a day or two afterwards, sometimes more.As for sleep, while I personally haven't found it all that helpful or detrimental when I sleep more or less than normal, I know others have reported at least some mild to moderate changes in symptoms, so don't rule it out.But back to the OP, the white-coated tongue sounds very much like a yeast infection, which is not typically part of CFS.\u00a0\u00a0A doctor can prescribe an anti-fungal mouthwash or systemic anti-fungal to help with the problem.\u00a0\u00a0The rest of your symptoms match CFS fairly well, though they can also be caused by a number of other things like the yeast infection possibly affecting the rest of your system.",

            "answer": "I have found that when I do mild exercise, I am ok afterward, tired, but like I am usually (which is tired all the time). But if I exercise strenuosly (sp?), it knocks me for a loop the entire next day and sometimes into the one afterward. I take a dance class on Monday nights (don't want to give up), but Tuesday I am tototally useless, because I am beyond exhaustion. So, yes, you can exercise but you should keep it low and mild.Also, I believe that yeast infections are common for CFS. I have read that in the research that I have done on CFS.\u00a0\u00a0You should see a doctor for that.Good luck!",

            "answer": "am very much with robinhood, with time and slow excercise, learnig what your limits all help greatly but its feeling well enough to be able to start this in your daily routine. it does build your stammina and you gain more energy. all your symptoms do sound normal symptoms. i also suffer with yeast infections continuasly and no matter how many times i treat it or avoid certain foods ect it comes back. i have been using a natural candida balance that i get from holland and barrat. its called dida and costs about \u00a320 this will last for a month but then the second month the table itake drops. i have found this the only thing that helps keep it balanced and no infections have occured since, it also stops sweet cravings if you have any. hope this helps",

You can probably buy it at a natural health food store, but I know Thorne Research's products are high quality.To answer your other question, any kind of sugar will exacerbate yeast infections and whip cream has sugar. There is a natural sweetener called Stevia, which can be used to sweeten things and does not exacerbate yeast problems. Stevia can be purchased at health food stores also.",
