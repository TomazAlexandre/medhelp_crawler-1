    "question": "I am 34 years old today actually and I am also about 3-1/2 weeks pregnant. My first pregnancy with my 5 year old son was normal, with the exception of gestational diabetes. For this pregnancy, my HPT was positive only 6 days after my period went off! So I'm guessing that would have made me about 6-7 days pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I went into the doctor's office the very next day to be tested and the doc said that the test was a faint positive but it was positive nonetheless. I was sent for bloodwork the same day and my levels were 367. I tested again 2 days later and my levels were 358. I tested again 5 days after that and my levels were 275. The doc said that it might be an ectopic pregnancy or a miscarriage in the making since my levels were so low and decreasing. Also, the transvaginal ultrasound didn't yield a sac either. I haven't had any bleeding or spotting just\u00a0\u00a0very light cramping from time to time. My only real symptoms are very swollen breasts and slight back pain. The doc said that I will miscarry soon. What am I supposed to do, wait around to bleed out (miscarry)? Could it be possible that this is just a very early pregnancy and that my levels might increase? Help! I'm worried!",
