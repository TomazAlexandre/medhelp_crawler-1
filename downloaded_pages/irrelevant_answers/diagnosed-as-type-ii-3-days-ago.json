            "answer": "What meniere135 has to say is totally true!As a matter of fact, I would even dare to add that without even asking anyone you must at first instance stop eating processed & refined sugars at all. As far as atkin's diet is concerned, only your physician can give you a green signal in case he agrees with Dr. Atkin's diet; personally, I do agree but I also suggest my clients to cycle the carbs once weekly so that there are no chances of diet-induces keto-acidosis that could possibly occur to those following atkin's diet too stringently over a longer period of time.Parth Adhyaru",

            "answer": "Welcome to the \"club that nobody wants to join\". For better or worse there are many people with Type 2 diabetes who ignore it completely and think it won't go away. Then there are people who manage it on a daily basis and successfully control their blood sugars. The ways to control type 2 diabetes is with change of diet (reduction of carbs), weight loss if necessary, exercise, and, if necessary, medication. Medication is not the enemy, and if it is needed can help control your blood sugar. However, I agree with the previous poster that it shouldn't be the first choice; diet, exercise and weight loss should. I am going to send you a PM with a website with a lot more diabetics of both types. There you will get the support and knowledge you need. Hang in there, there is a lot to learn but you have the right attitude.",

            "answer": "Please do talk to your doctor or CDE, but don't be surprised if they don't fully support low carb eating. Many doctors are still adhering to older ADA requirements which include very high carb eating and have not yet accepted the validity of low carb which we diabetics know a lot more about.As for Ketoacidosis: Dietary ketosis caused by fasting or eating very low carb is not the same thing as DKA (Diabetic ketoacidosis). DKA is a state of exreme and uncontrolled ketosis and will result after a period of time of very high blood sugars. People on low carb diets produce some ketones but it is not dangerous unless you have very high blood sugars consistently. Two very different things.",
