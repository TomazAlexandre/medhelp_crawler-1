            "answer": "By 37 weeks most babies will do fine but sometimes there's a concern about lung maturity. I had my dd at 37 weeks due to GD complications and she was just fine. I would have been a lot less nervous if I knew I was having her at 38 or 39 weeks though. Personally, if you can wait and it's only and issue of size, I would hold off another week or so. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Sorry....I'm not ImmortalOne, but I just wanted to tell you pretty much the same thing that the above poster said. At 37 weeks, generally all babies are just fine. There is just a concern about lung maturity. If there is a greater risk to Mom, then they will take the baby. I'm guessing that since they want to take your baby because of size, she probably is developed enough to be just fine at 37 weeks. Especially since the due date is just an estimate usually....you can actually be due 2 weeks in either direction of the due date you are given!I'm sure everything will be just fine with your little girl! :) Good luck!",

            "answer": "For me if Lilith had been born at 37 weeks, her lungs were immature and she would've weighed under 5lbs.\u00a0\u00a0To be honest, after all the complications I had during my pregnancy, during my labor, and then how she had to be in the Special Care Nursery (and she was born at 39 weeks), I would say the same to anyone - if you can wait out till 39 weeks do so.As far as size, remember that ultrasounds are not exact.\u00a0\u00a0They told me Lilith would be almost 8 lbs.... she was barely 6.",

My doctors want to do a c-section around 37 weeks because my baby is so large due to my diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering if they do it that early is there going to be something wrong with her when she is born, because if so i will ask them to wait until 38 weeks to make sure she will be healthy.",
