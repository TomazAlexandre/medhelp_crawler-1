            "answer": "The constant, unquenchable thirst is a classic symptom of juvenile diabetes. The frequent urination also points to juvenile diabetes. I have never heard of body odor being a symptom. I've also never heard of cold being a symptom, but weakness, lethargy, and weight loss are all major symptoms - and the weight loss in particular could lead to feeling cold. As to behaving badly in daycare, irritability is among the major symptoms of juvenile diabetes. Be SURE to get your daughter to a doctor before - and I really hate to say this - it's too late. Untreated juvenile diabetes is life-threatening and, if ignored, leads to coma and death. It is a VERY treatable condition, but it MUST BE TREATED. She should have her blood sugar level and urine checked.",
