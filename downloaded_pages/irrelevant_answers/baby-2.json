            "answer": "I may be wrong, but I think that diabetes does put you at risk of preterm, one of my friends had gestational diabetes and they did expect baby to arrive early (he was only a week early in the end) but I'm not too sure how that compares with you having diabetes normally. I'm sure you will be carefully monitered and maybe baby will be prepared early with steroid injections to help prevent any problems which may come from being premature. You are probably best to speak to your doctor /midwife who will know if your other early arrival had any relation to your diabetes and the likelyhood of it happening again. Best of luck to you, I hope it all goes well.",
