            "answer": "The things you can do to slow the progression of your diabetes are: Lose weight and maintain a healthy body weight, exercise on a regular basis and learn about a diabetic diet, basically eliminate sugar and drastically cut all carbs such as cereal, bread, pasta, rice and potatoes. Replace them with protein and fresh vegies. There are many many websites online regarding Type 2 diabetes. Complications from diabetes can be prevented by maintaining healthy blood sugars. I would suggest getting a meter and testing your blood sugar two hours after various meals so you see what foods and portions you can eat and stay under 140.",
