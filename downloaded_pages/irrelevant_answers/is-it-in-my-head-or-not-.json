            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.I would recommend speaking with your midwife. It does not sound like diabetes. Pregnant women do need to increase their calorie intake, but if you are feeling lightheaded frequently you should have it checked out. In the meantime make sue you are eating regularly. Keep snacks with you to prevent yourself from getting to the point where you are not feeling well.Good luck. Congratulations on your pregnancy.Cathy",

    "question": "I'm 13 weeks today. I'm always hungry as if my\u00a0\u00a0sugar levels are low. There is not history of diabetes in the immediate family. But I'm concerned its every couple of hours where I go dizzy & all light headed until I eat something sweet or a glass of milk. I've always been bit a snacker way before being pregnant, this is my 2nd LO. I'm not big person I'm just about the typical average person I do cook & eat good proper hearty meals so I'm unsure. I'll be mentioning this to my midwife next time I see her but I'm curious if these are symptoms of diabetes or if its all just in my head sort of thing. Appreciate any advice given.",
