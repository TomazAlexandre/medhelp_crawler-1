            "answer": "Prednisone is an accepted treatment for pseudotumor cerebrii, but usually doctors are reluctant to give it to patients who are overweight due to the potential side effect of further weight gain, which is thought to be associated with pseudotumor - thus potentiating a vicious cycle. However, since you are:1. unable to tolerate the first line or more traditional meds 2. you're obviously making great efforts to lose weight and get in shape3. getting symptomatic relief with the medicationthen prednisone seems to be the optimal medication for you.Now keep in mind I have never seen you personally and cannot make any accurate clinical diagnoses or treatment plans without doing so. Also, longterm prednisone does have other side effects such as bruising, osteoporosis, diabetes, and electrolye disturbances just to name a few. Talk to your doctor again or discuss this with your neurologist. I can understand how you may be frustrated as prednisone seems to be helping you, but I'm sure your doctors just have your best interests at heart. Perhaps you can work out a short term treatment plan with steroids.Good luck.",
