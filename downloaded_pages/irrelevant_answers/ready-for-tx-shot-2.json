            "answer": "I have always loved water but this is a whole new ball game. I drink cranberry juice but cut it with enough water that it's not too sweet. My dr. said any kind of liquid that doesn't have caffeine. I drink the 'light' juice with splenda.I get that headache too when I don't drink enough. I eat peanut butter toast when I take my morning riba. I don't think the pills cause fever, I think it's the shot. Just my opinion.I feel best today, thursday, then tomorrow starts over again. I will do shot 4 tomorrow, not too far ahead of you.Hang in there, it stinks that you have to go thru this again!Best wishes for svr in '07!Bug",

He has to eat nutritious foods for the diabetes, but he's also had issues with the taste of food. He feels hungry, and then can hardly eat when he tries to. He's still getting bouts of naseau (sp?) We'll be glad when this is over!! It's funny, though, about your apples and yogurt tasting bad...apples and yogurt are about all he can eat when he's not feeling well! Go figure! He's lost a lot of weight, too. Probably about 40 lbs and he's on week 31. I keep trying to get him to eat. He's lost enough weight for now!!",
