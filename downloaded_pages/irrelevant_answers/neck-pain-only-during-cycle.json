            "answer": "This symptom is the oddest I have ever heard! It is not funny at all but the way you worded it and my sense of humor, I am sorry but I laughed so hard I cried! I am serious now. First you need to see exactly what is going on in your neck. How are hormones involved, if they are? I don't think it is from the diabetes or high blood pressure. I know some people get those high blood pressure headaches. Get to a dr and maybe get a musle relaxer. Flexeril suck in my opinion but was taking Parafon Forte 500 and now I am on valium (yes, good for muscle spasams). Next of course is a pain pill. Tylenol 3 or 4 is good for cramps and since it seems your cramps are moved up they still might help. There are a good variety of pain pills out there from narcotic to non-narcotic. Keep going thru them until you find one that works. Never be afraid to ask the dr to switch or go to a higher dose. But get to the dr because something is not right and keep us posted on whats is going on. Best of luck! Dee088",

            "answer": "I have an unstable shoulder girdle with associated neck injuries and my symptoms worsen considerably after ovulation, too. The instability of my shoulder girdle increases which in turn increases my pain levels so I usually need to almost double my pain medication in order to function 'normally' during this time. The way that I understand it is that in the second half of your monthly cycle you produce higher levels of the hormone progesterone - which drops away rapidly at the onset of your bleeding. This acts on your soft tissues to 'loosen them up' (ready for the potential growth of pregnancy) which is why it affects my shoulder girdle stability. Since I'm not sure of the cause of your neck pain, IceeyJ, I'm not sure how it would affect you - but maybe you'll find this explanation helpful :). Apart from taking more pain relief I have yet to learn how to better manage this time of my cycle so I'm sorry I can't offer any other answers.I'd be interested in anything anyone has to add to this topic because I think so much of what we hear about back and neck pain ignores this progesterone action that has so affected me, and must surely affect other women as well.Wishing you Well.",

    "question": "I have been suffering from neck pain for almost two years now. After I turned 30 years old, I have been diagnosed with diabetes and high blood pressure. The neck pain came shortly after turning 30. It is REALLY bad for two weeks every month, which starts a day or two before I come on my cycle all the way until a week after I gop off of my cycle. What does my cycle have to do with my neck pain? Why after 30 am I hurting in my neck instead of my abdomin when I come on my cycle? What can I do to stop this pain?",
