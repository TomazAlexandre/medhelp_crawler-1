            "answer": "Hi!My WBC and Platelet counts were dropping before I ever started tx. They're even lower now that I have been on treatment. WBC was down to 1.3 so my doc started me on Neupogen three weeks ago. It's brought it up some but still no where near normal. I think what was happening to me was that other organs are becoming involved because of the liver problems. I've had the Hep C probably since 1969 when I received blood transfusions after a car accident. Didn't find out I had it till Nov. 2007 and that was just because I had some lab work done and my liver functions were off. I already have some cirrhosis but no symptoms to speak of. Hope this helps.

You would be more prone to catching things and getting sicker because you couldn't fight it off. When your platelets are low you are at more risk of bleeding.",
