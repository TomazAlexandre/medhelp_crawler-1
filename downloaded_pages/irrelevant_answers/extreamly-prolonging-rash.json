            "answer": "Hi Thomas,We aren't doctors here, and to find out what it is really requires a doctor visit. That said, I can say that I have not heard of that as a symptom of diabetes, unless you are also experiencing unusual thirst, frequent urination, and weight loss. If you are experiencing those, then you should get to an endocrinologist and figure out a way to pay for a visit. If you're not, it could be any number of things, but it seems quite unlikely to be diabetes.It sounds miserable. I hope you can start a little medical savings account and save up enough to get to a dermatologist-- hopefully she or he can figure it out and get you some relief!",

            "answer": "I too have suffered from the same rash symptoms for years. I have seen several doctors, all with pretty much different diagnosis'. Anything from poison oak, poison ivy, sumac, shingles, nerves. You name it and I suppposedly had it. I have had steroid shots, oral meds., creams and I thought a couple of times I had gotten rid of it, but it always came back. I noticed it for the first time when I was pregnant with my daughter. My OB Dr. at the time said he thought it was just a simple case of yeast on the skin and gave me a cream/topical to use. It helped, but if I stopped using it, it would just come back. Needless to say 16 years later and here I set today with the same problem. I did finally find out what it is. I can't remember the medical terminology for it, but this one Dr. told me it was a diabetic rash brought on my elevated bloodsugars, stress. If you haven't already done it, you need to check into getting a fasting bloodsugar draw to determine whether or not you are a diabetic.PS. This rash starts out with tiny red bumps that starts to look like a blister. It's extremely itchy to the point of driving you crazy. Beware of hot showers or any kind of heat next to it, this seems to irritate it more!",

            "answer": "I have a re occuring rash which i believe is caused by elevated blood sugar levels. It is uncomfortable and very itchy. The dr did give me some steroid cream but it only returned again because that dosen't fix the problem it just suppresses the symptoms.I would recommend not going to the doctor if you suspect you have diabetes type 1. Instead i would go and see an alternative practioner such as a homeopath because the earlier you go than the more chance they have of alleviating your problem. Otherwise you will be stuck on insulin for years and eventually your diabetes will drive you into insanity...You can always try and control it but to keep it balanced all the time requires much dedication. It consumes your life, whever you go and whatever you do you will bring it all with you. Most of the time i do not feel balanced even when I am balanced I may not feel well because of my blood sugar yesterday or earlier. It requires much patients and deligence and still after 10 years i have not mastered it at all and I feel liike i am living for it. I am working just to keep myself alive daily, why? I don't want to live if i cannot be free and relax. I don't enjoy life. I can't forget about it it is alway there everyday. I am constantly watching something all the time. Only when my bloodsugar is balanced do i feel happy, so i must consistently work toward this state all the time.It all comes from the doctor's idea that death is the end and they must 'save me' but by performing their 'heroic' acts they cause me a life full of misery. I have never thought that death was in fact the end and shortly before i was 'saved' by the doctor i felt i was dying and going to heaven, a great relief poured into my heart as i knew that i did not want to continue the road with such a heavy load when i was 13.",
