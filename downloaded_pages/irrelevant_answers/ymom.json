            "answer": "I\"m going to make an assumption she is or was a smoker? If she hasn't stopped smoking the COPD will progress much faster then if she doesn't smoke. The fact that she is on oxygen could very well mean that she has lost a great deal of lung function and she could be experiencing heart failure as well. Uncontrolled diabetes also contributes to heart damage and various other organ damage. So it really depends on how well her diseases are being controlled and other factors. My grandmother lived for nearly 10 years with heart and lung failure, and she also had diabetes. However, she never smoked a day in her life. If you really need to know what her future prognosis is, then you could ask her doctor?",
