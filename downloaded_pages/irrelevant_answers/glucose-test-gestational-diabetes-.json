            "answer": "They give u a sugary drink u have to drink it then after an hour they do a blood test.. I was told I do not have to fast but to not eat any thing high in sugar like juice or high in carbs but to eat something light and high in protein so it won't affect the test.. I think a passing score is under 140 if it is above you have to go back for the 3 hour test",

            "answer": "I was told to eat a light meal, no sugary items. You drink the sugar drink sit for an hour and get blood drawn. If you fail the 1 hour you will have to do a 3 hour which is how they tell if you have GD. You do have to fast for the 3 hour. I failed my 1 hour and I'm going for my 3 hour on saturday. Good luck.",

    "question": "hello,Those of you who already took your glucose test. How do the doctor determine you have diabetes? I heard they will give you a sugary drink and you have to wait for an hour for the result. Also before the test you cannot have any meal.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true? And when are you allowed to eat?",
