            "answer": "Hi there,Few fruits like grapes, mango, bananas and pineapple, have a high glycemic index and high sugar content. This means high carbohydrates. For fruits you should eat fruits low in sugar such as cranberries, lime and blackberries. Bread, cake, pastries, pasta and foods with breadcrumb or battered coating should be avoided. For more details and queries it is suggested to consult a nutritionist. I hope it helps.Best luck and regards!",

            "answer": "Fruit is fine, but in moderation.\u00a0\u00a0They are high in fiber and antioxidants, but can have a lot of fructose, which digests more slowly than, say, white flour or cane sugar, but still shouldn't be overdone.\u00a0\u00a0But a piece of fruit a day won't harm you.\u00a0\u00a0Also remember that vegetables are all carbs, so the notion of low carb diets is misleading -- what you really want to do is eat low on the glycemic index and eat what you digest well, but saying all fruit except the bitter ones is bad for you is probably going overboard unless you eat too much of them.",
