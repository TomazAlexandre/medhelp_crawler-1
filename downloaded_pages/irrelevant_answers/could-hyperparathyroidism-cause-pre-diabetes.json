    "question": "One year ago I started feeling sick all the time and was eventually diagnosed with hyperparathyroidism and am awaiting surgery.\u00a0\u00a0In the same time frame I became pre-diabetic. I have no family history of diabetes and am not overweight. My question is, could the hyperparathyroidism cause pre-diabetes? The nurse at the Norman Clinic told me sometimes the pre-diabetes goes away after the parathyroid is removed. What do you think?",
