            "answer": "Hello Wilma,Welcome to the Pain Management Forum. I am sorry to hear about your problem. I hope you are not serious or I am misunderstanding your post.If your truly have \"black\" legs this means you have Necrosis. This is a medical emergency. Necrosis (basically means dead) it is the name given to premature death of cells and living tissue. Necrosis is caused by external factors, such as infection, toxins, severe circulatory\u00a0\u00a0issues or sometimes trauma. You should have pain with this life-threatening condition. This can be from long standing diabetic circulatory problems which would or certainly should have been noticed on a visit to your PCP.I will not comment further until you are able to provide us with more information. Do you actually mean \"black\" or are your lower extremities discolored, possibly blueish? Of course that is not a good sign either but it does not mean that you have necrotic tissue. I will wait to hear from you again before I offer further comments. However if you do mean black as in necrosis you must go to the ER now.I'll be waiting for additional information.Peace, Tuck",

            "answer": "Dear Wilma,I am totally with Tuck on this one.\u00a0\u00a0If your legs are actually black that is not a minor problem.\u00a0\u00a0THIS COULD BE A SIGN OF AN INFECTION THAT COULD POTENTIALLY KILL YOU!!!I don't want to be an alarmist but an infection in any part of your body can cross over and end up in your blood stream, then you are called SEPTIC and I cannot stress how fast you can go from feeling fine to gravelly ill in a matter of hours.\u00a0\u00a0I personally had several bouts of MRSA (Medically resistant staph infection) that left my right leg and migrated to my blood stream and It is a very scary thing.\u00a0\u00a0I lost my right leg above the knee because they could not get rid of the infection with the strongest arsenal of antibiotics that they make.\u00a0\u00a0I spent 3 and a half months in the hospital the first time it happened.. several weeks the second and third time it happened and 4 months in the hospital the last time it happened and then I got to hop out of the hospital..GO TO THE DOCTOR NOW, PLEASE AND keep us posted on your condition.\u00a0\u00a0I am not majorly religious but I am praying for you...!Vickey",
