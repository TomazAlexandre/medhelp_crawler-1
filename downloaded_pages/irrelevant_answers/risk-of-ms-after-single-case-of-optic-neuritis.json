            "answer": "Hi and welcome.Here is one thread that discusses your question in detail. Quix is an MD who also had MS, so she is very careful to give us accurate information from reliable sources.http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Multiple-Sclerosis/Mild-Severe-ON--MS-/show/301247ess",

            "answer": "Maybe doctors deal in medical percentages all the time but for someone who has had several less than 1% chance medical incidences in my life, percentages mean nothing if you are in the 1% that has whatever it is.I have never had ON, there is no family history of MS in my family and they haven't found any brain lesions, yet I have MS.\u00a0\u00a0I am not saying that to scare you, just to say that MS like a lot of other diseases happen to people that don't fit \"the profile\".You don't actually say she is experiencing any symptoms. So are you just trying to figure out if she could possibly have MS with no symptoms simply b/c she had ON two years ago?\u00a0\u00a0If so, you are just asking to be stressed out. Let it go for her sake and yours.If, however, she is experiencing symptoms of some sort related to a neurological problem, there are a lot of tests that need to be performed before an MS dx can be made. In which case she should be seeing a neurologist to take her history and begin that process.Good luck.Julie",

            "answer": "Yes she recovered completely and has had no symptoms ever since.I understand what you're saying and I know that percentages are of no consolation to sufferers, but some of the %s quoted in reference to ON seem just unbelievably high...I hope you're doing well! Thanks for the replies guys!",

            "answer": "I get it.\u00a0\u00a0And I am sorry if my answer came off as snarky. I know you are just concerned for your friend. What a relief that she has no sx and has completely recovered!Your question was totally legitimate and it is useful for a lot of people to know the answer to it, not just you.The percentages can also work in her favor though.\u00a0\u00a0Just because percentages are high for something doesn't necessarily mean that she is in that unlucky percentage. I have beaten huge odds over the years and yet, I am leading a very normal life, compeletly free of any disabiltity.If I were someone who had any increased percentage for getting MS the first thing I would do is make sure I get plenty of vitamin D (I would take suppliments) and I would make sure I take care of myself (rest, sleep, exercise, keep stress low).\u00a0\u00a0After that, I would live my life normally.Julie",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply Julie :) I don't think she takes Vit D and I have known about that link, in fact it seems that a very large % of the population of the northern hemisphere is relatively deficient in it so who knows.. maybe everyone should be on it.The problem is just that when you try and research ON you are immediately confronted with nothing but MS. I cannot find a single story of someone describing ON with no subsequent MS unless it is from some other clear cause like trauma or cat scratch disease. My friend had the full work up and basically got a Dx of idiopathic ON so that's putting her in the MS ballpark but the impression given by the internet is.. she is going to get MS simple as that.",

            "answer": "Ok I just did a pretty epic journal trawl and I think I got the picture at last:[quote]Of 19 patients without MRI lesions, none developed clinical multiple sclerosis, although 3 had new MRI lesions. In a second study with a 5.6-year follow-up of 74 patients with optic neuritis, 22% developed clinical multiple sclerosis (Jacobs et al 1997); 76% of these had abnormal MRIs initially. Of note, half of the patients who did not develop clinical multiple sclerosis also had abnormal MRIs at onset. In a third study, optic neuritis with no MRI lesions led to multiple sclerosis at 5 years in 16%, versus 51% of patients with 3 or more MRI lesions (Beck 1997). The 10-year data for this study show multiple sclerosis in 22% without MRI lesions, and in 56% in those with 1 or more MRI lesions. The amount of disability is unrelated to baseline lesion load. In a fourth study, optic neuritis with no MRI lesions led to multiple sclerosis at 5.5 years in 6% of 44 optic neuritis patients, versus 82% of patients with an abnormal MRI (Morrissey et al 1993). With no baseline MRI lesions, a patient has a 25% chance of developing multiple sclerosis in 15 years (Pula and Reder 2009). With 1 lesion, the cumulative probability is 60%. With 3 or more lesions, the likelihood is 78%. Optic nerve enhancement itself does not count as a lesion. In a fifth study of 102 Italian patients, optic neuritis with no MRI lesions did not lead to multiple sclerosis at 8 years, whereas 57% of patients with an abnormal MRI did develop the disease (Ghezzi et al 2000). Despite the correlation between MRI lesions and development of multiple sclerosis, 19 to 31 years after the first episode of optic neuritis, 20 out of 30 patients had brain MRI lesions, yet had no clinical manifestations (Nilsson et al 2005). Spinal cord MRI helps determine dissemination in space in only 1% to 4% of optic neuritis patients who have normal brain MRIs (Dalton et al 2003).[/quote]So 1) there is a massive difference between normal and abnormal MRI risks 2) lumbar puncture, age, sex and race probably alter these risks even more but to what extent isn't very clear, 3) the studies on this have used pretty small population samples, almost all only ~50.. 4) as each study looks at different time frames and as you look at 15 years+ rates you are going to be confounded with the increased rates due to ageing and that doesn't seem to have been corrected for?So over all, yeah if you get ON at all then you are going to be worrying about MS, but if your MRI is normal than you fall somewhere between >1% and 30% of ever developing MS, probably closer to 30 than >1 but nobody is really sure.What you tell an 18 year old girl coming in with ON then I really don't know...I reiterate: I hate neurology. Most depressing field of medicine.Thanks for the help guys.",

            "answer": "There is no doubt her odds are increased (definately not a for sure!) because of the ON but heck a lot of people live with increased odds of breast cancer, heart attacks, diabetes, etc, for one reason or another. It doesn't mean they are going to get it.She is young and healthy now, that is what she needs to concentrate on. Heck, all the things I worried about when I was young NEVER happened to me, but there has been a whole host of things that never occurred to me that did happen to me. Life is kind of like that.One of the things my neuro told me after dx me was to stay off the internet doing research on MS. He said it was overly negative. This is the only forum I have ever been in and have not researched MS, but I have read the literature my neuro gave me.My kids do take vit D suppliments now that their risk for MS has increased due to my dx.\u00a0\u00a0They know about their increased risk. Of course at 16, they are not worried (it's called feeling invincible) but they are also taking their lead from me.Julie",

            "answer": "Thanks again Julie, you are very right!I suppose it's just the fact that heart attacks, diabetes etc. are risks that we are all very familiar with. But optic neuritis, even as a medical student, is something I knew very little about until my friend told me and so you dive straight into the literature and it seems very jumbled. I still don't really know what kind of picture it paints, not like if someone asked me their risk of developing diabetes because their mother had had it, where I would be fairly confident in the likelihoods involved.I guess I'll just have to let go! Not something I am good at, I get very stressed out about these things.Thanks guys! Good luck to you all with any conditions you may have!",

    "question": "I am a medical student and I am finding it hard to figure this out, so I can imagine how stressful it must be for patients!A friend of mine suffered a severe case of unilateral optic neuritis about 2 years ago. She is black, female ofc, and she was 17/18 at the time.As far as I know she had no other neuro symptoms before or since.All tests at the time came back normal, she lives in the US so I imagine they did the full shebang of tests too. No lesions on MRI anyway, no family history of MS.Basically.. what is her risk?! There are so many studies out there all saying different things! A lot of them are of such small patient groups to.. like 100 patients sometimes! And it doesn't often stratify your risk according to your demographic and symptoms, and for example, ON in \"children and over 40s\" is supposed to be much lower risk than the 2-30 age group but where does 17/18 fit into that?So I was wondering if someone here knows what sort of risk she has, are we talking \"she pretty much has MS, just a matter of time\" or are we talking \"very unlikely but a slightly higher chance than someone who hadn't had ON\"?1%? 10%? 75%? I have seen them all!",
