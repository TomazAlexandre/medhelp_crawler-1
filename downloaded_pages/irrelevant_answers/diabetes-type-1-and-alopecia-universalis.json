            "answer": "Hi!Overuse of steroids can precipitate a diabetes like condition. Hence, this possibility should be ruled out. Yes, diabetes can cause hair fall by reducing blood supply to scalp and causing scalp dryness and increasing the risk of dandruff.Hair loss can also be due to dandruff, dermatitis, shampoos, oils, soaps, dust and dirt etc. Thyroid disorders and diabetes too could be a cause. Insomnia, stress and anxiety along with poor diet and excess of caffeine too can be the cause.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, increased bilirubin can cause hair loss. This happens mainly in hereditary hemochromatosis which is a genetic condition in which excess iron is absorbed from the gut and stored in various parts of the body. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi! I am 23 years old, I was diagnosed with DM type 1 recently and I developed alopecia universalis, later on. Are these two diseases related to each other? I know it is something like an autoimmune process going on in my body. However, is there still a cure for alopecia universalis? Before I was diagnosed with DM and alopecia I had several lymphnodes in the cervical area and was even treated with prophylaxis of anti TB medications despite negative PPD and Xray results and later on I was confined due to cholesystitis secondary to typhoid fever. I had at that time a fatty liver,slight ascitis and slight pleural effusion. I also had several episodes of allergic reactions to an unknown allergen and was treated with antiallergies and steriod. So, are there possibilities that those previous medical conditions precipitated my diagnosis of my present conditions? Please help. Thanks and regards.",
