    "question": "This problem started about a month ago. I am a 39yo male and have been having back problems off and on for 9 months. My left leg has always had pain since, so I decided to go see a Chiropractor to see if he or she could alleviate it. After my 5th session I noticed a tingling sensation in my penis and a pulling/retraction pain. I awoke the next morning with a painful erection and ever since it has been painful. Also when I stand or stretch my penis retracts into my body and when I lie down it relaxes. I had an MRI of my back and they said they found nothing remarkable. The doctor also did a physical exam and found nothing wrong. I am in a lot of pain and frustrated. Any help would be extremely appreciated.Thank You,ChrisI",
