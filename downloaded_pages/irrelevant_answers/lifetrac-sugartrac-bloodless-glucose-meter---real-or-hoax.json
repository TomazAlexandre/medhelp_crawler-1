            "answer": "Dear Tony,I asked a couple of other volunteers about LifeTrac and none had heard of a beta test for a non envasive glucose meter.\u00a0\u00a0I also checked the web and other sites and could find nothing. It's possible I have missed something, but as we all know and as you said, we have to be a little cautious when it comes to somethings on the internet. You did'nt say where you saw this, but personally, unless I know it is a reliable source, I try to verify like you did.\u00a0\u00a0My son has had type 1 for 18 years and would also love a meter like this.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone else has indeed heard of it, we may see a comment.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck.dm",

            "answer": "I actually gave them a call.\u00a0\u00a0They're located in Maine.\u00a0\u00a0And tehy're not the only company doing this - seems since the late 60s some 30 companies have researched and actually developed the technology into a viable product .... they just never brought it to market. Most of the calls for information to them have been in reference to it's use with children.This month they start Phase II of their trials with production grade model; it *does* work (with somewhat better accuracy than LifeScan's OneTouch Ultras); and sometime in 2004 we should start seeing the device in use.\u00a0\u00a0They don't seem to have a problem with Glucose monitor manufacturers lining up to market/produce the technology either.The device has to be written up the medical journals and get FDA approval. But the technology is here.\u00a0\u00a0Their website's out of date at the moment, but it's at:http://www.sugartrac.net/",

The spiral-shaped circuit at the center of the device (pink) emits electromagnetic waves; the electrical properties of a thumb placed on the spiral change how energy passes through the circuit. The Baylor researchers are analyzing the changes in energy to gauge glucose levels. Credit: Randall Jean/Baylor University",

            "answer": "THE BOSTON GLOBEMarch 14, 2008A small Franklin company says it is developing a novel device that could potentially let diabetics continuously monitor their blood-sugar levels \u2014 without having to draw blood.Echo Therapeutics Inc. is expected to say today the device passed one of its first key tests, a pilot study with two dozen patients in the intensive-care unit at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. The Symphony system, a disc about the size of a half dollar, is designed to read glucose levels through the skin and transmit the information wirelessly to a nearby computer or hand-held meter. Currently, diabetes patients must normally ***** their skin to draw a few drops of blood and place them on a measuring strip.\u201cI think it\u2019s extremely promising,\u201d said Dr. Stanley Nasraway, a Tufts University School of Medicine professor and director of surgical intensive-care units at the medical center. Nasraway said Echo\u2019s experimental device appeared to be reliable, relatively accurate, and easy to use, though he cautioned that it must first be tested in much larger clinical trials with a wider group of patients.If successful in broader trials, Echo hopes to win approval from the US Food and Drug Administration to market the device as soon as late next year to both hospitals and diabetics for home use. Company executives estimate at least 1.5 million diabetics in the United States currently test their blood-sugar levels twice a day or more, and could potentially benefit from the device, making it a multibillion-dollar market.\u201cIt\u2019s an enormous market opportunity,\u201d said Harry Mitchell, chief financial officer.To be sure, Echo is still tweaking the device. It now uses ultrasound technology to expose capillary blood vessels to measure blood-sugar levels. But in future versions, the device will scrape off the outermost layer of skin.Other companies have failed in efforts to market alternatives to needles for diabetics. In 2001, Cygnus Inc. won FDA approval for its GlucoWatch, a blood-sugar meter that could be worn like a wristwatch.But the device was eventually discontinued amid complaints it was not accurate and caused skin irritation in some users. Johnson & Johnson, which now reportedly owns the technology, did not return calls seeking comment.In addition, several companies, including Pfizer Inc. and Eli Lilly & Co., recently scrapped projects to develop an inhalable form of insulin, used to regulate blood-sugar levels. Eli Lilly was working with Cambridge-based Alkermes Inc. on the technology.Echo also would face competition from other companies, such as DexCom Inc. of San Diego and Medtronic Inc. of Minneapolis, which have developed systems to let patients insert a glucose sensor just under the skin. The sensors constantly monitor glucose levels for up to a week before they need to be replaced. Echo says its system is superior because patients wouldn\u2019t have to use a needle to insert the sensor, which could be placed on the body like a bandage.But Echo would likely need to raise tens of millions of dollars for clinical trials and other work to bring the product to market. The company had $2.3 million in cash as of September.\u201cWe see lots of interesting ideas,\u201d said Medtronic spokesman Steven Cragle, \u201cbut actually getting them approved is a much different story.\u201dAnd so far, investors do not seem impressed by Echo\u2019s potential. Its stock closed at $1.35 Wednesday, down from a high of $31.70 in 2004. Echo\u2019s market value is just $25 million.\u201cWe have really just started telling our story,\u201d said Echo chief executive Patrick Mooney. \u201cIt\u2019s not a negative. I think Wall Street just doesn\u2019t know who we are.\u201dMooney said the Echo technology was originally pioneered in 1996 at Robert S. Langer ScD \u201974\u2019s lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and then further developed by Sontra Medical Corp., which merged with Echo last year.The American Diabetes Association, which promotes diabetes research, declined to comment.",
