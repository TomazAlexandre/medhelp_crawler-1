            "answer": "Hello and welcome to the medhelp forum. I would appreciate if you also put up a clinical brief about your current symptoms and any other symptoms back in 2005 when this MRI was done. there are various non specific reasons for these periventricular\u00a0\u00a0and peri atrial hyperintensities in the white matter of the brain as seen on MRI. These could be related to ischemic changes in small blood vessels of the brain particularly if you have hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol. It can be seen in migraine headaches, which is again a vascular headache. Multiple sclerosis needs to be investigated if you have other symptoms. Your symptoms need to be correlated with clinical findings and other investigations before coming to a diagnosis. Consult a neurologist at the earliest. Wishing you all the best.",

    "question": "2012: Can you give me your opinion please I would so appreciate it. Multiple area of abnormal increased T2 and flair signal present in the strip white matter. There is periventricular predominance and demyelinating disease is suspected. Chronic microischemia changes not totally excluded.\u00a0\u00a0There is mild atrophy of the corpus callosum.\u00a0\u00a0No lesions are identified in the posterior fossa.Diffusion weighted sequences appear normal. The ventricles are normal size. No mass or midline shift. The cp angles are clear, the craniocervical junction appears unremarkable.IMPRESSION: Nonspecific white matter signal abnormalties in the cebral hemispheres. Demyelinating disease is favored over chronic microischemia changes.2005:Flair and T2-weighted images show several small foci of hyperintensity in the cebral white matter. These are most prominent in the peri-atrial areas. This is not a specific appearance in a patient this age, ddelineating or chronic ischemic change might be considered.IMPRESSION: Multiple areas of T@ hyperintensity in the cerebral white matter as described.Why can't they we understand this, we have the problem. I realize if any of you would help me with this, it would be just an opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much!Tags: MRI Brain question",
