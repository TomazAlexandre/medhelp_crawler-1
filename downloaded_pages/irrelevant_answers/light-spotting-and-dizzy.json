Those are the ones listed in the last post. However this forum IS restricted to a certain amount of new questions each day. There have been a couple times I've tried to post a new question and have gotten the Forum Full message. I would however like to see each person only take up one thread for all of their problems each day. I've actually found the archives on this site very helpful and have personally avoided taking up a thread on more than one occasion after finding my question answered.",
