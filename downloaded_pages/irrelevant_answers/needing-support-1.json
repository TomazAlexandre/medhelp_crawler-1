            "answer": "Wow im going to the exact same thing, i also have a 2 yr old. In my case the separation has been very difficult, he cheated, he is not helping financialy, and just disapears for weeks at a time. He is doing drugs and also gave me a std (nothing major but still). My due date is on the 20th but doc thinks is gonna be before. This pregnancy has been so hard, i got diabetes, i only gained 5 pounds.... so i totaly understand how u feel. All i think about is i am almost there!! We can do this, clearly we can make it without their help. They are the ones losing not us, and if they dont wanna be a part of their kids lives thats on them, one day they will answer to that. All we have to do is stay focused and strong for our kids .and remember you are not alone!! Hang in there \u263a",
