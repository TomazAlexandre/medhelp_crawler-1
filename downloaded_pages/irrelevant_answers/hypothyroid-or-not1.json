            "answer": "I am having blood work done tomorrow to see what my levels are.\u00a0\u00a0They have always been normal since my surgery in 02 but I have always had symptoms of hypothyroidism but since the levels were normal no one including the endocrin. would do anything about it.\u00a0\u00a0He told me to lose weight because I was borderline diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Well, that was part of the reason I went to the endocrin because of the weight gain and other symptoms I was having.Today my new dr told me he understood where the endocrin was coming from BUT your levels can read normal and you are still hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't go into great detail about it but will once my results come back.\u00a0\u00a0All he said was it's usually more underlying than just the levels.",

            "answer": "Your TSH does show hypothyroidism. You can have all kinds of strange symptoms. Your thyroid has to do with alot of things in your body. I had tons of symptoms associated with my thyroid such as- low blood pressure, numbness and tingling in my feet and hands, extreme forgetfullness, brain fog, constipation, anxiety, heart palps,seizure like black outs, periods of hypogycemia and I felt like an 80 yr old woman!! ( that's not even a total list of all my symptoms) There are so many symptoms which can be different for each person.If you feel like your internist is not treating you correctly you should see an endocrinologist.Best Wishes~",

    "question": "I have recently taken a blood work up and my doctor said I am Hypothyroid. I have TSH at 6.5 but my T4 is barely normal, and my T3 is okay.\u00a0\u00a0I went to see my doctor because I complained my hand was still pins and needles after being stuck in traffic. I had hung my arm out the window for 3 hours.I am concerned because my general blood work shows acceptable ranges for a lot of things but really not in optimum.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried that my health is just not right and I am not sure if hypothyroidism is not from more than just my thyroid working right.How do I get to the right doctor? My internist is saying she can solve my problems alone.",
