            "answer": "If you eat a varied, healthy and well balanced diet and don't overdo it on the cakes, biscuits, sweets, fizzy drinks and too much fruit drinks, and exercise, you should be fine.It is true that anyone at any age could get diabetes, pre diabetes or glucose intolerance.Being overweight with a lot of fat around the belly, having a parent or siblings with diabetes, this will put you at a higher risk of getting the disease.If you notice any symptoms like foggy vision or start to feel very thirsty, or go frequently to empty your bladder, and especially after eating too much sugary foods - or feel very sleeping after having a meal, make an appointment to see your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He can send you for a glucose test, or send a blood sample to check your HbA1C levels.Other symptoms to watch for is if you get a headache or start to feel very nauseas when you feel hungry.\u00a0\u00a0These symptoms could be those of hypoglycaemia - low sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0People who do not have diabetes, can also get these symptoms.Choose breakfast cereals and yogurts that have a low sugar content.\u00a0\u00a0Don't be fooled by labels that say \"healthy\" or \"low fat\".\u00a0\u00a0These products may still contain too much sugar.The best way to track what you eat is to write it all down.",

            "answer": "Eating foods with fibre allows the body to release the energy more slowly.\u00a0\u00a0Whereas, what are called \"simple carbs\" are those that are processed with no fibre, sweets, cakes, white bread for example will give you a high sugar spike only for your sugar levels to drop down very quickly.Eating a well balanced diet with fibre rich foods won't spike your sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Eating smaller healthy meals and healthy snacks in between your main meals is far better than overindulging at one sitting.Portion sizes are very important too.You will find more information about portion sizes and healthy meals on the web.",
