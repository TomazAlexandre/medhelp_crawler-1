            "answer": "Hello,I am very sorry to hear about your premature coronary artery disease.\u00a0\u00a0Just about everyone with coronary artery disease should be on:aspirinstatin (lipator, zocor, crestor, etc)beta blockerace inhibitorI notice you are not a statin -- do you know why?\u00a0\u00a0If you had muscle aches, we usually try another statin.\u00a0\u00a0If that still doesn't work, we will at least use Zetia unless your LDL is already rock bottom.\u00a0\u00a0Even if your LDL is less than 100, we still use statin medications in everyone with out an absolute contraindication.Make sure you have very tight control of your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Glucaphage is a great diabetic medication that we like to use at maximum doses (assuming normal kidney function) before starting another agent.NO SMOKING (your probably don't but we can never say this enough).Consider a second opinion at a major medical center if you haven't already had one.\u00a0\u00a0If you do this, take with you your echocardiogram, lab work if you have it and the catheterization films probably on\u00a0\u00a0CD.I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and thanks for posting.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your time. My apology, I am on Lipitor (40mg/day) Yesterday we (my doctor and I) decided to increase it to 80mg, since my Triglyceride was little higher and HDL is lower. For anyone reading this, I was a smoker since I was 20. At the age of 30 I had first MI and CABG X3, and I was not over weight. Please listen, CABG is not a fix for our condition; it is merely keeping us alive. I went on smoking even after my first CABG in 97. Now at the age of actually 39, I had second MI and re-do cabg x5 by one of the best surgeon in the country, I realized - CABG is a temporary fix. And I did quit cigarettes 5 months ago. So can you.",

            "answer": "What a coincidence! Ihave an almost exact replica of your CAD history and procedures. 2 CABGs, stent implants in between with last OHS just last September and now still having chest discomfort but with nausea on exertion. I am also diabetic, hypertensive with high TG, VLDL and low HDL. I had a stress Echo in May 06 which showed EF of 55% but with Stage I dyastolic dysfunction. An Adenosine stress test last month also indicated some stenosis in the apical and inferolateral areas of the heart. My meds include Glucotrol, Coreg, Diovan, Zetia and Coumadin since I did have a Bicuspid Aortic valve replaced with a St.Jude mechanical. I am concerned about another Angiogram since I had 5 Catheterizations done last year including the 3 stent implants. The cardios have me off Aspirin/Plavix since they said that they bypassed the stents in my last CABG but I notice you are still on these meds. Fortunately I have never smoked but still afflicted with this severe CAD. And since my last CABG done at CCF I have done all followups at CCF. My chest discomforts usually suside with application of Nitro patch which may help you out. If you don't mind because of our very similar conditions I would like to keep in touch with you. My email is: ***@****.Thanks, Chris R.",

            "answer": "I had a Quad bypass in Sept 04 at the age of 55, the day after Pres. Clinton had his bypass. When he says \"I feel your pain\", he is telling the truth. In Nov 04, my bypass failed. I have one and a half open. They cannot use anymore veins since they are too small. Attempt to stent failed also. So I live on Nitro. I would get chest pains every night so they changed my Nitro patch to night use.Even then, I can get chest pains if I have a physical dream. I dreamed one night that I was a Templar Knight and in a sword fight. My oponent pressed my sword into my chest and I had chest pain. Then I woke up and sure enough, I was in a full blown angina attack. I have to sleep in my recliner since I get chest pains when sleeping flat.My meds include Metoprolol, Plavix, Ecotrin, Cozaar, Pravistatin, Niaspan, Protonix, Darvoset, Amitriptyline, Combivent, and Nitro Tab/Spray PRN.Over time, you will learn by the way your chest feels when to pop a Nitro. I do not know what else we can do in these situation. My Cardio will not let me work. I cannot walk far to exercise due to Spinal Stenosis. I know what it is like to get chest pains just from taking a shower, making dinner, or cleaning house.I quit smoking 2 months ago. One more month and I can get into a Chelation Therapy Study they have going here. I hope that helps providing I do not get the Placebo.My CABG was done by the Pepin Heart Institute. I have 2 Cardios at the Cardiovascular Center of Tampa, so I always have a 2nd opinion. It never hurts to have a second opinion.",

            "answer": "After reading up on chelation I am also considering this route but want to do some more research because of my particular heart condition (AVR with Dacron patch). I have also seen the ad for the NIH research trial and hope to enroll if accepted. I do have regular dreams but they wake me up with heavy palpitations and almost always with high BP. I am now considering CPAP since a sleep test indicated mild to moderate sleep apnea with little or no REM sleep. I would welcome input from anyone who have done chelation therapy and what were their results one way or the other. Also whether CPAP helps with the night waking spells, palps and high BP?",

Most of the material removed is excreted via the kidneys so these must be in good shape and some people apparently do suffer some kidney damage. I have just received some hopeful news that I may be included in the NIH trial here in Tampa but must have all the necessary blood and kidney tests. I have obtained alot of info on chelation and arteriosclerosis and natural treatments from a website: Afibbers.org.
