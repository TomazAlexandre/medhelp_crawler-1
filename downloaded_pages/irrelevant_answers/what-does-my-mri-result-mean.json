            "answer": "Hi!Ok here is the explanation:A persistent right trigeminal artery: this is no cause of concern, is present in some individuals.vertebral and basilar artery flow-voids are small: This means there may be mild narrowing or kinking of these arteries which are unlikely to require medical intervention.T2 hyperintense lesions: These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.small periatrial periventricular lesions: Not sure how they look, but could be due to MS.C4-5 and C5-6 MRI shows degenerative changes due to age, wear ad tear, arthritis etc. This is usually managed conservatively with physiotherapy, pain killers, hydrotherapy, acupressure etc.Please discuss in detail with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history.

    "question": "Can you help in laymans terms tell me what my MRI results mean?A persistent right trigeminal artery may be present, an anatomic variant. The vertebral and basilar artery flow-voids are small. Cerebrum: Multiple small T2 hyperintense lesions are seen in the cerebral white matter, excessive for age. Most of the lesions are scattered randomly, but small periatrial periventricular lesions are present. No mass effect is appreciated. Cerebellum: No lesion seen. Mild cerebellar tonsillar ectopia is noted. C4-5: Decreased disk height and signal, uncovertebral joint degeneration, facet disease and posterior disk osteophyte complex. Central canal is normal. Moderate right and mild to moderate left foramina narrowing. C5-6: Decreased disk height and signal, uncovertebral joint degeneration, facet disease and posterior disk osteophyte complex. Central canal is normal. Severe right and moderate left foramina narrowing. Any deciphering would be greatly appreciated!",
