            "answer": "I am type 2 also.\u00a0\u00a0I have nerve damage in my spine and other places (not diabetes related).\u00a0\u00a0Even though it is different they seem to be treated similarly.I am also a chronic intractable pain patient. With that I want you all to keep in mind we all react differently to different kinds of pain and meds.I was started on opiates which do help some (I know many are against this, however there have been quite a few times I was almost driven to ending it all)I was given Neurontin and it kept being upped, it made me very tired, but that is all. Baclophen didn't help either.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor begged me to try Lyrica. It didn't help except with sleep.\u00a0\u00a0 There are other meds similar to neurontin that may help better.Now some may think my meds are extreme, but as I said w/o them I probably wouldn't be typing this.\u00a0\u00a0I try to take as little of the opiates as possible. Because of a spinal cord injury my psyiatrist (physical therapy doctor) doesn't want me to go to p.t.\u00a0\u00a0 He isn't the only one that has told me that. My last surgeon forbade it. I know why now, The surgery failed.I am on Morphine,oxycodone(prn), xanaflex for spasms(used often for spinal cord injuries and M.S.\u00a0\u00a0 I am on 2 antidepressants ):Mel you should really ask your doctor about your husbands nerve damage, whether there is a way to help relieve the pain and possibly stop the progress.\u00a0\u00a0I know good control should do wonders.",
