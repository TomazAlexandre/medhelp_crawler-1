            "answer": "Your test results and history say that you have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis, and are hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately many doctors are hung up on TSH as being all they need to diagnose and treat a thyroid patient.\u00a0\u00a0Just because Free T4 and Free T3 are within the ranges doesn't mean that is adequate for you.\u00a0\u00a0Due to the erroneous method used to establish the ranges, they are far too broad to be functional across their entire breadth for most hypo patient.\u00a0\u00a0Many of say that symptom relief required Free T4 at the middle of its range, at minimum, and Free T3 in the upper part of its range, or as necessary to relieve symptoms.Before going further, please tell us about your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Also, what did you mean that symptoms come and go?\u00a0\u00a0Over what time frame?",

            "answer": "You have a lot of symptoms that are frequently related to being hypothyroid, which is consistent with your Free T3 and Free T4 levels that are too low in the range.\u00a0\u00a0So you need to find a good thyroid doctor that will treat you clinically, by adjusting FT3 and FT4 levels as necessary to relieve hypo symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief should be all important, not just test results.\u00a0\u00a0If you will tell us your location, perhaps we can recommend a doctor for you.When you see another doctor, I also suggest that you should test for Vitamin D, B12 and ferritin.\u00a0\u00a0Hypo patients are frequently too low in the ranges for those as well, which can cause symptoms, and also affect metabolism of thyroid hormone.\u00a0\u00a0Also, since you mentioned that the symptoms seem to be inconsistent, it might also be a good idea to get an ultrasound of your thyroid gland.You also listed a symptom of frequent urination, and dehydration, which made me think that\u00a0\u00a0you should test for the possibility of diabetes just to be sure.\u00a0\u00a0 Note the following.Common warnings signs of diabetes include:Increased thirstIncreased hunger (especially after eating)Dry mouthFrequent urination or urine infectionsUnexplained weight loss (even though you are eating and feel hungry)Fatigue (weak, tired feeling)Blurred visionHeadaches",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response. I live in the Boston area.My vitamin D and ferritin levels are low, but my B-12 levels are normal (mid-high). I had a thyroid ultrasound several moths ago and it showed increased vascularity and mild thyroid enlargement.I've been tested for diabetes several times and have been told that I don't have it (my a1c levels are also normal). I do suffer from frequent hypoglycemia (this is the opposite of diabetes right?).",

            "answer": "What are the reference ranges for your T4 and T3?\u00a0\u00a0Reference ranges vary lab to lab and have to come from your own report... Also, were those Free T4 and Free T3 or were they Total T4 and Total T3?\u00a0\u00a0They aren't the same tests and don't provide the same information.It looks like your doctor should not have decreased your Armour... Did she do that because of the low TSH?\u00a0\u00a0TSH is often low/suppressed when one is taking a medication containing a T3 component, such as desiccated hormones or when one simply is taking an adequate dose of any thyroid hormone.Your Free T4 may be too low and you might simply need to add a small dose of T4 to your Armour, depending on the reference ranges for your T4 and T3...Your high TPOab indicates that you have Hashimoto's, which is the #1 cause of hypothyroidism in the developed world.",

    "question": "I went to see a new endocrinologist and they said these results were normal and in the middle of the normal range (with the exception of the antibodies):TSH: 2.6 (.35-4.9)Free T4 0.95 (.89-1.89)T3, total: 96 (60-181)Anti TPO AB: 1118 (<5)This is the third endocrinologist I've seen so far and they didn't check my FT3 levels. My FT4 is at the bottom 6%, which is far from 50% and they claim it's normal and in the middle of the range. My TPO antibodies seem to increasing very rapidly and I don't know how to stop them (they were 130 two years ago, in the 400's-800's last year and now they're in the 1100's).\u00a0\u00a0I have symptoms that come and go, but all 3 endocrinologists seem to think they are not related to my thyroid. Am I hypo??I've pretty much given up on endocrinologists at this point. Any advice would be appreciated.Previous thyroid labs:Sep 2014:T4 serum free: 0.97 ng/dL (0.7-1.48)TSH: 2.16 u[iU]/mL (.4-3.98)T3 free serum: 2.4 pg/mL 2-3.9Thyroid peroxide ab: 781iu/ml (<5) HTSI: 44% (<140) August 2014April 2014:TSH 1.7Free T4 1.2Thyroglobulin Ab: 83.9 IU/mL (<19.0) HTPO ab: 420 IU/mL (<34) HNov 2013 - Mar 2014:TSH 3.8-4.2 mIU/Lfree T4 1.0-1.2\u00a0\u00a0(range: 0.9-1.7)(had lots of hypo symptoms)mid 2013:borderline low TSHnormal free T42011:very low TSHborderline high Free T4(had lots of hyper symptoms and was told I was hyper)",
