            "answer": "First off Carrie, I am very sorry for your loss. Saying goodbye is always difficult, more so when you dont know exactly what happened.As I read your question I too first thought of a urinary tract infection. The initial symptoms fit however it would not have been fatal. A considered diabetes as well. Diabetes causes an elevation in the blood sugar levels and results in excessive urinating, urinary tract infections, and weakness. Once you mentioned the extreme amount of blood during her final days I knew that this was likely a common urinary tract cancer called Transitional Cell Carcinoma (TCC). TCC is more common in older dogs however can be seen in dogs as young as 2 or 3 years old. It starts of as an infection and then causes urination troubles, pain, weakness, and eventually a lot of bleeding.My condolences to you and your family, I hope this helps a little with closure. TCC if very difficult to control and cannot be cured.",

    "question": "3 Days ago our beloved Pekingese passed away. She was almost 7 years old. For a while she had been acting as though she was in pain when she jumped up on the couch but other than that she had no other symptoms of being ill. About 2 months ago she had blood in her urine ONCE that was extremely noticable. Then we started noticing the urine had a foul smell. My husband and I are at the moment having financial difficulties and I could not afford for her to be seen by a Vet so I called..he said it sounded like a UTI and he prescribed an antibiotic which got rid of the foul smell but she starting urinating alot more frequently. Her urine was also cloudy. She was trained to go outside... She would come in the house after having urinated outside, and urinate more. I mean she would just be walking around and then all of a sudden start urinating. She showed no signs of pain.. did not sleep any more than normal. She ate like she always did. On Wednesday, the day before she died, she vomited ONCE and had diarahha. She also seemed as though she was having a hard time climbing the steps to come back inside. I would have to pick her up and tote her in. Thursday morning, She had died on her bed. It looked as though she had bled out of her rectum or vagina...Not sure which one. The blood was very dark. I am just trying to get some closure as to why she died because this was so unexpected. Any information or thoughts would be very appreciated. Thanks.",
