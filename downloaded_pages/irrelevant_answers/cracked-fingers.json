            "answer": "I have had this condition for years now. I have had just about every prescription and OTC product available. The best thing I have found by FAR is a cream you buy online from Medco Lab. It is called Lanaphilic ointment with 10 % urea. It costs about $14 for a 1 lb jar which lasts for a couple of months. It is especially helpful if you apply at bedtime, as well as throughout the day.Good luck and let me know how this works for you. Everyone so far that I have recommended this to has loved it. I'm trying to get my Dermatologist to get some and give out small samples. It works so much better than what they gave me at their office.",
