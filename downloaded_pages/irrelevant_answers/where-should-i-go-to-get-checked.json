            "answer": "Hi!You must begin with your primary care doctor and get investigated for diabetes. Seborrhea, fungal infection (may be you have this on toe nails), repeated diarrhea, boils etc are common in diabetes. Cold ankles and feet could be due to diabetic neuropathy.Other than this you could be having an inflammatory bowel disease such as Crohn\u2019s, IBS, celiac disease etc, which has probably weakened your immune system. You may need a referral to a GI doctor. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
