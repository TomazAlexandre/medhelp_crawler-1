There isn\u2019t too much that can be done regarding his platelets; depending on how low they became often the only option is dose reduction/treatment cessation.Can you further detail his intolerance to therapy? Was this subjective intolerance?You should be aware there are no physicians on this site; only patients.Bill",

            "answer": "I would suggest your father follow up with the gastroenterology clinic. They may also refer him to a hepatologist if his condition is advanced.He should be monitored for liver cancer every six months, as he has cirrhosis. He should also be given beta-blockers to reduce the risk of developing internal bleeding. He may also be given meds to treat hepatic encephalopathy which is common amongst most patients with cirrhosis.The clinic may also want to do tests to learn more about how far his cirrhosis has progressed. Many people can live for up to 10 years before they start to have symptoms of decompensated cirrhosis. (Fluid retention in their abdomen, bleeding varies, hepatic encephalopathy (confusion and coma)). Unfortunately once these signs of decompensated cirrhosis appear, his liver will quickly become progressively worse and he will need a liver transplant to survive.Since your father can not tolerate treatment for HCV the only options are for him to stay stable for many years until new HCV treatments become available that don't include the use of interferon and ribavirin. This is many years down the road as of now. His other option is to get on a transplant list at a major institution that performs liver transplants.Best of luck.Hectorsf",

            "answer": "Hi Susan, there are many of us out here who have had cirrhosis for 15-20 years with no signs of decompensation. You are correct. I was diagnosed in 1992 with cirrhosis (by biopsy) and again a couple of years later after unsuccessful tretment. I am also not allowed to do any more interferon as it rapidly drops my neutrophil count to extremely low levels (the last time to 0). There will be trials in the near future with protease and polymerase inhibitors and no interferon. As for getting on a transplant list, they won't look at you unless you are decompensating.",

He has chronic viral hepatitis C infection with early cirrhotic changes aand high viremia. 18 months ago, he was started on antiviral treatment with 180 mcg pegylated interferon\u00a0\u00a0alpha-2 and weight based daily ribarivin. The patient developed marked leucopenia and thrombocytopenia. He was seen by hematology service and given supportive measures and GCSF with interruption of treatment. After correction of hematologic parameters, the patient did not even tolerate half dose treatment. Decision was made to abandon antiviral treatment. He is now following up in gastroenterology clinic and hematology clinic.",
