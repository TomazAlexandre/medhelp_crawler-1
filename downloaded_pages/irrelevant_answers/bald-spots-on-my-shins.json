            "answer": "Hello,For these bald spots, alopecia aereta has to be ruled out. It is a medical condition in which hair is lost from some or all areas of the body. Alopecia areata is usually diagnosed based on clinical features.Trichoscopy may aid differential diagnosis but confirmatory diagnosis is by biopsy skin.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello Drm Community. I'm not sure if I have to continue living with this for the rest of my life but I have large bald spots on each shin since I can remember. It is more of a cosmetic thing but I was wondering with all the wonders of technology and medication if there is a solution to this problem. Possibly a way to re-grow hair in the area? Where I can finally feel comfortable wearing shorts and not feel embarrassed others are staring at my bald shins. I hardly wear long socks so that can't be an issue. I'm as healthy as can be.Any help, advice or comments are greatly appreciated.Thank you for your help.",
