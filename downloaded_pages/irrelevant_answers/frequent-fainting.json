            "answer": "Is the pacemaker actually working? Are the settings correct? It sounds like sounds like he may be going into a dysrhythmia and the pacemaker not kicking in, therefore causing him a lack of oxygen to brain so he passed out? He may be dropping his heart rate too low and the pacemaker not kicking in lick it should be, therefore causing him to pass out. Or he may not be eating enough due to loss of appetite, therefore causing him to have a hypoglycemic episode or low blood sugar, you may want to check his sugar periodically or question the doctor about this. Those would be the things that would come to mind first.",
