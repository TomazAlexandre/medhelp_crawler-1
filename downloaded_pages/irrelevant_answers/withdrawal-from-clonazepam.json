            "answer": "Unusual fatigue, unusual muscle movement, and one-sided weakness are rare side effects of clonazepam. If it was the clonazepam, then your symptoms should go away if you discontinue the medication. Maybe your doctor can refer you to a specialist. The pain could possibly have been caused by your initial back injury.",

            "answer": "your symptoms sound more like sciatica, or something similar due to your back injury. stronger muscle relaxants may help. i'd make an appointment with a neurologist, an ortho specialist, and a pain specialist in that order.",

    "question": "I have had a worsening condition for 5+ years. Been on clonazepam for over a year. ....\u00a0\u00a0 .5 mg at night at first, then another .5 tablet during the day. My legs, especially the left is getting worse. can hardly stand, muscle weakness and sensation of cramping, and actual cramping at times. There was an ititial back injury, but I feel the numbness and tingling I feel in left leg and both feet ( and lately even in the hands) is due to either medications or electrolytes or vitamin defiiency. I am on a roller coaster as to when and how much clonazepam to take. Sometimes it helps and other times it doesn't. I am at my wits end. I have seen many doctors and no one has an answer. Even the ER just gives me IV of Ativan and saline to ease cramps, but next day it is back again. Sometimes I feel worse after I eat, but was tested for diabetes and it was negative. I just want the pain to stop.",
