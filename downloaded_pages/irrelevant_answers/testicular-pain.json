            "answer": "I use to get testicular pains from over-masturbation. I been stop masturbating and no longer get that feeling. Not saying this is the cause but it could be... You did mention masturbate frequently. If you are forcing ejaculation, barely shooting out anything when you're not horny again yet, that could put trauma on the testicles.",

    "question": "I am a 62 year old male, diagnosed in the late 90s wit type 2 diabetes. In the 80s with HBP and high cholesterol - now pretty much in control. Latest A1C I thought was good but my doctor thought bad. 5.6I perform self examination of the testicle (as suggested after showering) and\u00a0\u00a0don't know what is a normal or abnormal \"lump\".Within the last two months I have had quite a bit of testicular soreness and swelling in the left testicle..sometime, but not often, in the right as well.. I noticed several years ago that my testicles were hanging lower and that the lower skin around them was loose and not taught around them. (sort of like that sagging skin around you neck when you get older). For the last several months there has been an accompanying lower back pain, mainly on the left. Sometimes I get lower front abdominal pain but that comes and goes and isn't severe.I do masturbate frequently so naturally i am wondering if I have created some condition and keep it aggravated. I am very concerned because I never had a problem before and symptoms, at the worst, point to testicular cancer.Can you advise how to proceed?",
