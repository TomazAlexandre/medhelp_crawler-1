            "answer": "Its not really a pass/fail kind of thing. They just check to see if youre body is processing the sugar like its supposed to. If it comes back on the high side (130 or higher) they will probably have you come back for a 3 hour test where you drink the liquid again (usually double the sugar concentration or twice as much liquid) then test your blood every hour for 3 hours. If 2 of those tests come back high, chances are you have gestational diabetes. But it normally goes away after you deliver. Hope this helps :)",

            "answer": "I did the two hour test. They take you in and take a blood test to see of your blood is ok then you drink the glucose drink( I agree choose lemon line if you can) and the. You have to drink the whole drink in 5 minutes. You sit for an hour after the drink is gone and then they test you again. If you puke you have to retake the test so I recomend closing your eyes and trying to nap durring your hour wait the drink made me very sick to my stomach for about 3 hours. It's an easy test just don't worry about it you'll be fine! The worst part was getting the drink down",

            "answer": "Technically if you fail it would mean you have gestational diabetes and it's not really bad they would just make you watch it and make sure your eating healthy. It only has bad effects on the baby of you don't get diagnosed or treated for it. I wouldn't worry diabetes runs in my family and my mom had Gd and I still passed! Don't stress yourself out over it.",

And I have this type of nasty drink before, wasn't the glucose drink, but it was for a scan because my gall bladder was infected. It's awful -.-",
