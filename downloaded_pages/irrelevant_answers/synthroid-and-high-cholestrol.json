            "answer": "While you wait for the dotor ot answer:Like all the rest, foods/drinks (and coffee), vitamins, and other drugs, take Welchol hours away from your thyroid medication.Welchol can make it harder for your body to absorb certain other medications, including levothyroxine/Synthroid. So as long as you take them both far apart from each other, you should be fine.Low Vitamin D, did you tell the doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Will you be taking supplements to build up your low V-D, I presume.\u00a0\u00a0I take supplements of 2,500 V-D with 25,000 V-A, plus I am a sun worshiper or I should say the sun worships me. ;)Good Luck - Good Health!GL,Thyroid patient - comments are based on readings from medicals and not meant as a diagnose or treatment.",
