            "answer": "What I recommend to people is google BMR and then TDEE this will tell you the caloreis at rest and the calories when active. Then you divide them up, protien 35%, carbs 50% and fats 15%.\u00a0\u00a01 gram of fat= 9 calories, 1 gram of protien =4 calories, and 1 gram carbs = 4 caloreis.I hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Try a high-fat moderate-protein diet - mine is about 75% fat, 25% protein. Yeah, zero carbs. Or as close to 0 as you can get.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, zero carb refers to an intake of less than 5 grams of carbs per day.\u00a0\u00a0For example, one egg has a gram of carb, so that's negligible. Eggs are practically a perfect food from a fat standpoint (almost 100% saturated).If you are looking to lose weight, you need to cut way back on carbs. Go as low as you can go.\u00a0\u00a0If you are looking for athletic performance, like running, swimming, and long distance cycling, fat adaptation works better than draining your glucose stores then hitting the wall, which is what happens if you high-carb it. Once you are fat-adapted, you won't believe the energy you have. Weight maintenance is a cinch as well.Carbs wreak havoc on insulin levels. It's the reason we've got an epidemic of diabetes in this country.\u00a0\u00a0Forget about high intakes. Anything over about 50 grams a day is definitely not healthy.Following anything put out by the \"Food Pyramid\" people or the USDA is just asking for trouble.",

            "answer": "To barn babe: Here's the deal: a high fat, low carb diet is NOT healthy (Dr. Atkins died of a heart attacks, you know). In fact, your body actually NEEDS carbs to synthesize all of that fat and protein you're eating. Otherwise, it's all void. Also, saturated fat is linked to heart disease and high cholesterol - things you really want to stay clear of. There's absolutely nothing wrong with eating carbohydrates. Carbs are the first macronutrient that your muscles go to for fuel, and if you're not taking any in, your body\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 will actually burn muscle tissue instead (note: your heart is a muscle).When it comes to carbs, whole grains are best.Your best bet is to go to a site like ***********.com and figure out your percentage of nutrients you should take in based on your calorie intake.",
