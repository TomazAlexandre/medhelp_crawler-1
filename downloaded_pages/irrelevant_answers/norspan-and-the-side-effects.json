            "answer": "Patches are difficult to taper from so I assume you will have to go ct. I think your best bet is to speak with your doctor and ask him for a safe taper plan. that will get you through the physical withdrawal.As far as the blood sugar goes, you should also speak with your doctor. I don't think anyone here can help you with a medical problem such as that. there is also a good diabetes forum here at MedHelp. You may want to post there and get some feedback but again, you should consult with your doctor.",

    "question": "Iv'e been using Norspan Patches for about 10 months now,and apart from not really helping my pain relief,I have lostabout 14 Kgs in weight,I quite often feel nauseous,and have really gone gone off most foods,I'm really never hungry.I have fibromyalgia,which has made life a misery,but you just get on with it I guess. One thing I can't stop eating islollies (sweets),,and I had my sugar tested last week by my mother inlaw,and it was 5.3.so,any help on this subjectwould be greatly appreciated.Thank You.\"Terry .Victoria Australia.",
