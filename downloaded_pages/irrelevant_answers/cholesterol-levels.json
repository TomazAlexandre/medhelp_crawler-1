No exercising. No I dont have diabetes. It just amazes me, that I change my eating habits 100%, and my cholesterol goes through the roof. How depressing.",

    "question": "Ive been posting alot lately... have had chest discomfort after exertion since I had swine flu in Nov. Am a 48 yr old female..high Blood pressure and moderatly high cholesterol. In Aug, I went on low fat diet. Watched labels ( my 51 yr old husband had heart attack-so I ate what he was recommended to eat by the Dr). We eat Zero red meat..very little sat fat...I read all labels, no junk food-well, I take that back..we buy \"Baked Lays\" for a snack...but I mean we have cut our eating habits 100% from what they were before his heart attack. I had a heart scan this week, and because I am overweight, the Dr that read it, said \"inconclusive\" but he did see several areas of narrowing arteries...I saw a cardiologist for the first time today. He reviewed the scan, said I def have plaque in some arteries, but wasnt convinced it was blocking anything...so before he does something like a cardiac Catheterization, he has scheduled me for a Nuclear Stress Test next Tues and Wed. I was \"bragging\" about how at least one good thing is that Ive been eating good, and that I would love to know what my cholesterol is ( Im not on any chol lowering med)..since Ive been eating so healthy. Last year, in March 09, my total chol was 214, good chol was low at 42... bad Chol 156...triglycerides 98...so it was all around not great...but borderline...my primary Dr ( a quack-Ive since dropped her after 2 months of her telling me that my chest burning upon exertion was \"pleurisy\") did NOT put me on Chol med.SO..today Im all bragging. I just got my results and they shock me!!!Total Chol\u00a0\u00a0266\u00a0\u00a0( ive never ever been this high)Triglycerides 109 ( not bad..not up too much..but still..up)HDL\u00a0\u00a044\u00a0\u00a0( not high enough but up a tad from last year)LDL a WHOPPING 200Iam absolutly stunned and SCARED even more. Something has to seriously be wrong with me, doesnt it?How can I be passing by all the delicious foods that I love, eating turkey turkey turkey ( yes, I cook with white meat only) and veggies and doing all the right things, and my chol levels JUMP like that, HIGHER THAN EVER?No wonder Im having chest discomfort!!! My arteries are probably a mess!Please...has anyone had cholesterol this high?? LDL this high??? Can anyone explain why it jumped so much in ONE year, when Ive been eating the best I have eaten in my life???One note...I was recently put on Hydrochlorithiazide (water pill) would this have any bearing at all on anything????I dont see my cardio till the stress test on Tues...any info anybody has would be great.",
