            "answer": "Lantus works very well, but when you are using over thirty units for a nightly shot - that's kind of a lot, I have to suggest you talk to your diabetic nurse to review your protocol. You can use both Novalog and Lantus, but not in the same syringe and not at the same injection site. Lantus is usually administered at night to bring your glucose levels down to normal in the morning. If you have abnormal glucose levels at bedtime, one philosophy is to bring them down to normal using a small amount of short acting insulin and then use the lantus to make sure they will be normal in the morning.",

    "question": "Page 1 of 269 for: I'm taking 32-40 units of lantus a day. My A1C is 6.7. Why would I be given a pill instead of short acting insulin if the lantus has proven to work so well?ive tried numerous pills for diabetes over the past 20 years. Efficacy never enough- so we tried lantus.",
