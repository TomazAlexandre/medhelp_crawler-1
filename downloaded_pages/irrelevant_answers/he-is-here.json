My due date is March 4, but gestational diabetes and high blood pressure and wanting to have my tubes tied,\u00a0\u00a0Doc said c-sect was probably best because inducing can take up to 3 days and 50% of the time it ends in c-sect anyway. I'm just worried about the ppd and recovery. Let me know how you're feeling with recovery if u get a chance.\u00a0\u00a0I know you'll be bust with baby.",
