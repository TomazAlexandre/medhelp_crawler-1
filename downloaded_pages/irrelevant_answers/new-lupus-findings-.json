            "answer": "It started a year ago I knew I had pcod so I went to endocrinologist to get my thyroid because my daughter had Hashimotos. So actually I was hoping the thyroid doctor could help me lose weight He said I had hypo thyroid and diabetes mellitus. Fine so I tested my blood and took synthroid about June of last year I had a sudden seeking spell I had gotten over flu and that maybe it was coming back with a vengance because I was so weak. So I went to er and they called thyroid Doctor and also I had been going to chiropractor for bad back and\u00a0\u00a0my back would be ok for a week or two and then it would get so stiff and burn and ache that I had to go back he said I had a bulging disc and some degenerative disease not so bad but there so to compete the er story they told me to go to neurologist and I did he found I had severe paraspinal spasms and some bulging but thought I might have had a tia or seizures so he decided seizures so I took his medication and lost twenty lbs and could not walk straight then cardiologist who said my heart was good but I was hardly able to make it through Walmart without being exhausted. My husband freinds were frustrated about how slow i walked and were not use to this. So I need a regular gp we had traveled because my husband and I never stayed in Houston for long enough to have a regular family physican. She ran me through test but thought I shoulc check out a different neurologist. So I did he check me mystenioius gravis and me to neuro opthalomologist and she though I could have something called drop syndrome but said it would take muscle biopsy by this time I had seen gastroenterologist cardiologist and endocrinologist neurologist and gp. So I decided if they arent finding anything It must be in my head but I no longer worked and couldnt remember thing well enough to keep my job I couldnt remember my customer names it was embarrasing so I stoped working some days my back doesnt bother me and I almost walk with a spring in my step and the next I have done to much the day before and I cant hardly walk to get a glass of water. So had a flu with a terrible case of chills they were the most painful thing i had experience to me it was just chills but they hurt my muscle so bad I thought I would pass out I had sore throat with ulcers in my mouth you would think a terrible case of strep except my strep was negative so back to doctor gp and endo and thyroid to low vit d to low and co2 low in blood work and some anemia and Positive lupus blood work she did a test just for lupus and it came back positive the things is my mother went to rheumatologist and took prednisone for rhrumatoid arthritus but she never looked cripple but she started throwing blood clots and they gave her coumadin. I just hope I dont have to go there\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry but you ask and I guess I just needed to put this all down I feel so crazy because I think I am well and then all the sudden the weakness will come back I also have lots of yeast infections",
