It depends how big you are really as there is more chance of us bigger mummies getting diabetes and few other complications but as long as you get enough exercise and eat your 5 a day and avoid too much sugar you will be fine, I feel fine and have no problems don't stress about it too much because honestly there is no need x",

My doctor is having me deliver via c-section but it's not a weight related decision. She said eat when I feel hungry and cut back on sugary foods/beverages. She said not to worry about the weight and just focus on having a healthy pregnancy :)",
