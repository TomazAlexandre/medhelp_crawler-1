            "answer": "My son is the same and I think it is the school day. Some days he is not able to do any homework and I leave him be.

            "answer": "This may sound very strange, but have you had him tested for Type 1 diabetes? My son was the exact same way, and although he has AS, he is also a newly dx diabetic.We found out he was aggressive because his sugar was sky high and didn't really notice the tiredness, until he really didn't want to do anything. By the time I caught it, his blood sugar was in the thousands and his A1C was 14.9! He was hospitalized immediately and put in ICU.I don't mean to be alarming, but sometimes even though it's the farthest from your mind, it's better to be safe than sorry.",
