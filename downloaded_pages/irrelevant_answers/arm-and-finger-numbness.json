            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Numbness in a single arm can be due to a pinched nerve in the neck or at shoulder or elbow. It can also be due to deep vein thrombosis in the arm. You will first need to consult a neurologist and rule out nerve compression by MRI or nerve conduction studies. Thereafter if this is ruled out, then you will need to consult a vascular specialist.Please consult your PCP for primary examination to rule out peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, hypothyroidism or due to Vit B12 deficiency followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
