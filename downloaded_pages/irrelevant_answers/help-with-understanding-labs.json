I would talk to the doctor, tell him that you think the dose is too high and see if he will cut it back.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, get another doctor.\u00a0\u00a0This is far too serious and uncomfortable condition to have a doctor that doesn't know what he is doing.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a reason she is on armour instead of synthroid?If you go to another doctor be sure to take her latest lab results.\u00a0\u00a0She should be tested every 4-6 weeks or less as she might be sensitive to the meds. I am and I have been getting my labs done every two weeks to make sure I do not go hyper again.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Just keep asking questions until you get answers.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in touch.",
