            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Very high ferritin levels above 1000ng/L are usually associated with hemochromatosis. Alcoholism, some types of anemia and thalassemia too can raise the ferritin levels very high. A high ferritin level with normal or low iron saturation is seen in conditions like\u00a0\u00a0alcoholic or infective liver disease, chronic inflammatory disease such as arthritis or asthma, hypothyroidism, and type 2 diabetes. All these conditions can cause muscle ache and fatigue. Discuss with your doctor and run tests to rule these out. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
