            "answer": "I am puzzled by this. I am not sure why you would be given metaformin if you do not have PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0If you are truely ov and getting a true period, then the odds of you having PCOS are not that great.Even though I had a period each cycle after charting my temps, I saw that I wasn't ov. This I had annovulation cycles. Even got +opks. Came to find out that OPKs only tell when LH surges are happening but not if you actually ov. Did your doctor do bloodwork to verify if you are ov?Any sonograms done to see if you had cysts on your ovaries?\u00a0\u00a0was you uternine lining checked for it's thickness?",

            "answer": "Well I am glad you had a through work up even if you didn't get answers as to why you are having trouble concieving.It must be something new or at least I never heard of using metaformin to prevent gestional dm; can't hurt to take it right and if it does prevent GDM then all the better.My sonogram showed cysts and coupled with my annovulation cyles thus a too thick endometrium, I was then dx with PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0However my blood sugar levels were always in the normal range.Are you taking clomid or any other fertility drugs to induce more follies to mature?",
