Explain that you have gained the weight and would like to lose the weight in a healthy way.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin wills but weight on if too much be taken.\u00a0\u00a0Not eating carbs also is not healthy for a diabetic, especially on the pump from what I have read and been told.\u00a0\u00a0I would check with your diabetes team and see a nutrionist to get you on the right track.",

            "answer": "ES,Some folks find that caffeine elevates their blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0If you think it might be true for you, you could experiment with having the same breakfast for a few days \"with\" your normal caffeine (I'm assuming coffee here, but you can apply this to any meal where you normally have caffeine).\u00a0\u00a0Check your BG an hour and two hours and three hours afterwards and jot down the results.THen go a few days, again having the same foods, but without caffeine at that meal.\u00a0\u00a0Do the same BG tests and jot down the results.If your pattern is that the results are higher with caffeine, then at least you know it's a factor.\u00a0\u00a0I've read that caffeine, as a stimulant, may make us a bit more resistant to insulin -- all else equal.\u00a0\u00a0For coffee drinkers, be aware of the calories in milk/cream/fake creamers, too.I'm not a physician, but have had DM for about 35 years.Good luck with this & your weight issues, too.",

            "answer": "There have been \"studies\" both for and against a diabetic drinking caffeine. I've heard that it helps type 2's, I've also experienced that it does seem to contribute to higher blood sugars in myself. But then there's also another study that said drinking caffeine helps a diabetic feel a low blood sugar (hypo) coming on. I've also found this to be true in myself. If I go without caffeine, I experience more lows that I do not feel.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard to know what study to believe... 8-}",

    "question": "I'm newly diagnosed type 1 (see Weight gain / Best Way to Lose Weight thread for backround info), and I saw on another thread a reccomendation that type 1 diabetics avoid caffine. I've never heard this before, and I'm wondering why and/or if this applies to all type 1's, or just the person to whom it was originally written.Thanks.E.S.",
