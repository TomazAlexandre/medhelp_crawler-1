    "question": "My mom, who is 83 years okd, has suddenly developed a problem with frequent bowl movement.\u00a0\u00a0I have questioned her carefully and found that she does not have any pain associated with her bowel movements but they come with urgency and she has to go right away, She had a colonoscopy before all this started and the doctor said she was clear. At the time they were looking for a source of blood loss. Initialy, when this problem started she had a lot of mucus in her stool. her family physiican said she may have a stomach infection and gave her some antibiotics. That helped with the mucus and, for a short time, with the frequncy but now she is back to 6-7 times a day. She is a diabetic so she does eat more fiber but not any kind of real fatty foods. I recommended that she insist on seeing a gastroenterologist. It just seems strange that this started all of a sudden. If you can shed any light, please let us know. I looked up Chron's disease and ulceratic colon but, the fact that she has no pain seems to rule those out.\u00a0\u00a0. .This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/234689\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/234689</a>.",
