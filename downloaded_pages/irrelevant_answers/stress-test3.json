            "answer": "I did a non stress test with my daughter (I didn't think they gave women stress tests!)The non stress test is basically fetal monitoring. They have you lay down in a semi reclined position and sick all the monitors on like they will in the hospital when you're in labor. They monitor contractions (strength and timing) and baby's heartbeat. You can also hear baby moving around! My little girl got the hiccups during mine so her heart rate read kinda funky!They did a non stress test for us because my water had been broken for a couple of days and they wanted to check my baby. She was fine, but my fluid was so low I ended up going in to be induced that night so that she remained fine! She was born a little less than twenty hours after my non stress test!",
