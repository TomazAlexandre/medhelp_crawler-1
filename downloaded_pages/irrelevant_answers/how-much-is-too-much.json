            "answer": "Yup, THAT sounds famililar.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 40 now; like your friend, since I was 21 (well, 18, really) I would binge drink.\u00a0\u00a0I *could* have only 1-2 drinks and stop, but if I had more than that I couldn't stop.\u00a0\u00a0Did stupid things, felt cruddy for days after.\u00a0\u00a0But it seemed \"ok\" meaning I still functioned well in school and then work, got good jobs and promotions, all that.\u00a0\u00a0But over time it really starts taking a toll, and I'd say that it's around 30 when body changes really start happening, metabolism starts changing, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, let's face it, being drunk or hungover can seem \"funny\" or \"ok\" in college but at some point as we enter our mature life, it just doesn't serve any social purpose anymore and just gets in the way of our potential and possibilities.Anyway, even though your friend's weight is ok, if he's not eating well and still binge drinking, his liver and other organs can get damaged.\u00a0\u00a0I have always been fit, never overweight, no family history of any diseases, but in my mid-30s I ended up with pancreas infection and diabetes, and I have only myself to blame.\u00a0\u00a0So, that's my cautionary tale.No one wants to admit they can't control their drinking; it's hard to quit.\u00a0\u00a0But if he's not drinking ALL the time now, then now is really the time for him to just give it up before his binging becomes habit and then that much harder to quit.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you and him.",

            "answer": "Generally if a person drinks to get drunk or gets drunk everytime they drink, they have a problem.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, when you get in your 30's or 40's it takes a toll on your health.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up years ago in the hospital with pancreatitis and it was very painful, I new someone that deveoped stomach ulcers and bled profusely in their 20's due to alcohol. I also knew someone that turned yekllow with jaundice because abuse of alcohol can cause many problems, mental and physcial but the problem is most people whil drinking can't see it until something huge happens.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck",
