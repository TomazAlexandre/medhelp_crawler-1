            "answer": "you should have your dr check out as many things as possible, because the list of causes is quite long. the simple solution is some kind of blockage, in which case take lots of laxative products, maybe even an enema. my dr said the excessive gas can be from irritable bowel syndrome (im having the same problem, but with other symptoms as well), but ive been dealing with mine for over 6 months now, so its doubtful youll die form it or anything. just keep going to the dr and insisting on any and all testing possible. also, sometimes, these can be from other issues having nothing to do with the digestional system, so if nothing appears there, youll have to start looking at other body parts. ill watch this board, and if i end up with any good results from my tests, ill post again.",

            "answer": "HiYou could be suffering from an inflammatory bowel condition such as Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Other than that it could be due to H pylori infection. It can also be food intolerance. Diabetes can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Constipation can also cause bloating. Very sedentary lifestyle is another cause. Fluttering can be due to gas. If you missed your periods then check for pregnancy as this can also cause excess gas, constipation and fluttering. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Take care!",

    "question": "I've been belching excessively and had a lot of gas for the past three weeks. Also, my stomach feels tight, like there is a knot inside and there is pain around the navel on the left side, the pain sometimes moves to my back or to the right side, it has been unbearable! I also feel flutters in my stomach. What do you think is happening to me? It is really scary, especially the fluttering in my stomach :(",
