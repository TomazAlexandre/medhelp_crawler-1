            "answer": "To dispel the doubts about the person recommending the concoction, first one has to locate him. Then ask him to produce the proof of genuine patients treated by him, And to produce medical pathological evidence of alleged cure. How many patients has been cured, along with personal interview of each of the first 50 patients. This is not enough. There has to be controlled testing of minimum 100 patients, as the claimed period of cure is very short. We shall then be able to judge the efficacy of the said treatment of diabetes cure. Hope all of you will see the reason, logic and argument behind what I am suggesting. Best Wishes.2. I just came across the herbal cure of another\u00a0\u00a0item: Paneer Doda as it is known in India. It is also known by its horticultural nomenclature : WITHANIA COAGULANS. I request all readers to check up this item's effectiveness to cure diabetes, any research findings supported by medical approval-esp. Ayurvedic.",

Maybe it is a hoax but the ingrediants generally hold great health benefits anyway, so no harm in taking it for a couple of weeks. If whole grains are used, as opposed to flour, you'll find that the filtering isn't a problem. The result is a dark greyish liquid, with a mild taste - predominantly of the black seed. It's not bad or disgusting to the taste either.",
