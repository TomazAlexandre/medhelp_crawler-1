            "answer": "Anyone can develop a Staph infection, although certain groups of people are at greater risk, including newborn infants, breastfeeding women, and people with chronic conditions such as diabetes, cancer, vascular disease, and lung disease. Injecting drug users, those with skin injuries or disorders, intravenous catheters, surgical incisions, and those with a weakened immune system all have an increased risk of developing Staph infections. If you don't have any of these problems then you shouldn't worry too much about this, just make sure to cleanse your hands everytime after entering outside of your home to avoid possible contact. Good luck to you. Sincerely, Elizabeth",

I personally would see ow if this one person is always getting these infections maybe suggest to the landlord or matience person that they be allowed to use a specific washer and dryer. for the whole time then throw in bleech after all said and done. No one should have to leave their place, especially if on site laundry is cheaper and easier to do\u00a0\u00a0laundry.michelle",
