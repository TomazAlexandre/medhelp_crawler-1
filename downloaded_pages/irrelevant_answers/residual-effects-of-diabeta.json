            "answer": "I am not a doctor and I am not familiar with your particular medical situation.\u00a0\u00a0Most people who take oral medications to lower their blood sugars are still producing some of their own insulin.\u00a0\u00a0How long it takes for your blood sugars to go up will depend on many factors, including how much insulin your body produces on its own, how much and what you eat, exercise, etc.\u00a0\u00a0 The real question is why would you want to discontinue a medication that has helped you maintain an acceptable glucose reading?\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to talk with your doctor before making any changes.\u00a0\u00a0If there is something you don't like about the diabeta, he may be able to recommend something equally effective without the effects you don't like.\u00a0\u00a0I f you do try to discontinue your medication, please check your blood sugars frequently so that you can monitor any rapid changes that might put you at risk.Es",

            "answer": "I am the person who presented this question. I especially appreciate the unexpectedly and remarkably quick response; however I was hoping for an estimate, however rough, of a range of time it might take for all of the effects of diabeta to have become negligible. Days, weeks, months? Or possibly there has never been any study on this? Now, as to the \"why\": The general belief seems to be that once a person is diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, it is for life. The person mentioned in the question has been able to get glucose readings under 120 without taking the medicine for 2 months (with daily exercise and smart food choices). So, he wondered if the years of medicine take a long time to wear off. Thanks again from \"Oliver\u00a0\u00a0B.\"",

            "answer": "Oliver,Sorry I have taken so long this time to respond.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also sorry that I don't know the precise answer to your question since I am not a researcher or a doctor, but just a volunteer.\u00a0\u00a0However, knowing that you have been diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes does shed some light on your situation.\u00a0\u00a0My understanding is that it is Type 1 that you have for life.\u00a0\u00a0I have Type I Diabetes and my body produces no insulin whatsoever.\u00a0\u00a0Without insulin, my blood sugars would go sky high within hours and I would get sick very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 Diabetics, however, are still producing some insulin.\u00a0\u00a0It just may not be enough to sustain their body weight or their diet or they may have some insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0The medications are used to stimulate more insulin production or increase the effectiveness of the insulin you do produce.\u00a0\u00a0Many Type 2s can go off their medication if they lose weight, watch their diets and exercise regularly.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like that is what is happening with you.\u00a0\u00a0The medicine is no doubt completely out of your system after two months.\u00a0\u00a0But you have obviously accomplished what many doctors treating Type 2 patients have a very difficult time trying to get their patients to do... to eat right, exercise and pay attention to their blood sugars\u00a0\u00a0My hat is off to you!\u00a0\u00a0That doesn't mean you are home free. You still need to keep up the good work.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases, people can develop Type 1 diabetes after years of keeping their Type 2 under control.\u00a0\u00a0So just keep on doing what you are doing, but watch your blood sugars and stay in touch with your doctor if you find that you are not able to get them down without some medicine. Good luck to you!Es",
