I've been Type 1 for 42 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0I am 1/2 way thru a six month observational trial for Symlin.\u00a0\u00a0One of the things the program co-ordinator told me was that once u open(start using) a vial it is only good for 28 days.\u00a0\u00a0this is whether it is refridgerated or not.\u00a0\u00a0this is also what the pkg insert says.\u00a0\u00a0If you are using beyond the 28 days this cld b the problem.",

            "answer": "I have tried several new vials and only use them for 28 days but still, it lost its effectiveness. I know that your body can become used to a drug and the effectiveness wears off but I would think it would take several months or even years as opposed to 3 months.",

            "answer": "I've had Type I for 19 years and I'm 47 years old. I've taken Symlin for about a year and over the last six months my A1C has gone from 7.2 (the highest it has ever been) to 8.1. I have never connected it to the Symlin, but now I wonder if that may be part of the problem. I take 10 units with meals. It's rare that my fastings are ever below 200 no matter what I do. I also take Lantus and Humulog. I've been seeing an Internal Medicine doc because there are no Endocrinologists in the city I live in, but I'm going to call for a referral to a city 75 miles from where I live to get a second opinion. Fortunately, I don't have any complications, but I wake up at night worrying that I may if I don't get my blood sugars under control. I'm not overweight, so that isn't an issue. I've asked my doctor about stopping the Symlin and he said it's not a good idea - that doctors are starting their newly diagnosed Type I patients on Symlin right away. I appreciate hearing from people who are struggling with this injection.",

    "question": "I started taking Symlin a few months ago and at first it was great and worked very well. I was able to reduce my boluses by half. However, over the past two weeks, it has become ineffective and I am already at the max dosage. At this point, I stopped taking it because I found myself super high 2-3 hours after my meal and feeling the usual effects of being high. Has this happened to anyone else and what did you do about it?",
