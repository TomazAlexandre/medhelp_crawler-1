            "answer": "The cause for small fiber neuropathy in most patients over the age of 60 is never found. Of the known causes, diabetes is the highest. Other disorders which could cause this include systemic amyloid, connective tissue disease, monoclonal protein abnormalities, toxins (such as alcohol, or some medications), and there is a group of genetic conditions referred to as hereditary sensory autonomic neuropathy.There are several classes of drugs which can be used for symptom treatment, and they include the anti-seizure medication (Neurontin), Anti-depressants (Elavil, Nortriptyline), Anti-arrhythmic (mexiletine), opiods, and capsaicin.Regarding treatment for the disorder, unless a cause is found there is no specific therapy. Also, the progression of the disease is unknown, and varies from patient to patient. Pain could indicate either worsening of disease, or in some instances recovery of function. I hope this helps, and sorry for the delay.",
