    "question": "Hi,I have a 13 year old black lab/collie plus some mix (about 35lbs).\u00a0\u00a0In the last few weeks she has lost weight to where you can feel her ribs most of the weight has been lost in her hips and stomach.\u00a0\u00a0She has never been a dog that ate very much, usually id fill her large bowl up maybe 3 times a week.\u00a0\u00a0She has slowed down eating her pedigree senior formula food and really only eats it when milk or table food is mixed in with it.\u00a0\u00a0Should this be taken as a sign that she no longer likes her food, she is also getting into the garbage more often.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a type of food that i should switch her to? Maybe a puppy food so she can gain more weight back?\u00a0\u00a0Also she has never handled wet food very well, would it be a good idea to mix in a small amount of wet food into her dry food?Thank You Very MuchSteve",
