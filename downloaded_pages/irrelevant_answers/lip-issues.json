            "answer": "It could be due to the fact that the Coumadin has thinned your blood more than usual, and it is causing it to flow faster and you are noticing it. Have the level checked, and ask your doctor as well, you might be taking a little too much of the drug.Oh, I would watch out the chewing on the inside of your mouth, since your blood is thin, you could start bleeding and that would not be a good thing.",

            "answer": "I used to get that and I have unhealthily low sodium levels so I have to eat tons of salts and such which means I easily get dehydrated. After I started my new job at a gym I started drinking lots of water and I haven't that issue for a while. The only time I do is when I don't work for a couple of days and don't have a reason to drink water. It may seem like a lot, but try to drink at LEAST 8 full glasses of water a day, if not more- while trying to cut down on sodium intake as well. If you can I would go to a doctor and see if all your chemical levels check out. Protein, Iron, Calcium, all vitamins, and especially your glucose levels. Diabetes can be a very dangerous thing if not treated, not to scare you, but my boyfriends mother, and both my grandparents had it. I also hate to say, but you may want to continue with an exercise routine or something similar that will increase your muscle mass. Being overweight can cause type 2 diabetes, which is just as dangerous as type 1 if not properly managed. Note: You can not lose weight if you don't gain muscle. Even if you play with your children and pick them up and put them down repeatedly it will help a lot.",
