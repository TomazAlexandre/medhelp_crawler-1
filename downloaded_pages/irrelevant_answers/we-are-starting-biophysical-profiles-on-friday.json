            "answer": "From what I gather they get 2 points for each thing they look for.\u00a0\u00a0My mil said (as well as what the emedicine website) anything under a 6 he will deliver right away because the baby is in distress.\u00a0\u00a0A 6 is borderline and will have to have 2 to 3 times a week profiling(my sil had this done with her last), and and 8 is good, and only weekly monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think he is in distress, and believe the tests will be good, but there is always that chance, and that is what makes me worry.\u00a0\u00a0From what I have read these tests are highly used and regarded as accurate (as well as any test can be), and I am very thankful he is not taking any chances.\u00a0\u00a0The positive side is that I am healthy (when mother is having problems it increases the chances of baby having problems) other than the gd.....good bp, and no protein in my urine. thanks for listening Patty.\u00a0\u00a0Dh is working seconds tonight and I am home by myself and stewing.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure everything will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0I am so glad you are 28 weeks!!\u00a0\u00a0Doesn't it feel good to hit that mile marker?\u00a0\u00a0I did breathe a little easier that week. And the u/s I had at 31 really hit home.\u00a0\u00a0All the other were before he would survive outside, but the last u/s was more real to me.\u00a0\u00a0Does that sound crazy?",

            "answer": "Not at all, You know, two of my nieces had their babies very early, I mean VERY early, both were only 6 months pregnant. Both babies (now 5 and 2 years old) are doing very well! One of my nieces had a grand mal seizure that lasted 12 hours and they were forced to take her baby, he only weighed 10 oz when he was born, but he was a fighter! He would get his little hands up under the cords and tubes and yank them out all the time. The nurses said they were on their toes the whole time he was in the hospital! Just knowing that, and that they are doing so well today gives me more inspiration that miracles can and do happen! It is possible for them lil ones to be born so early and do just fine! Let's hope and pray this isn't the case for you but even still, if by chance it could happen, there are things they can do now a days that really help them lil babies make it! I'm sure he is doing just fine in there and isn't under any kind of stress what so ever! It is good that you are healthy! That probably makes more difference then we all realize you know, it's great that you actually look at your diet and make sure you are eating well and not getting too much sugar. Anytime you need to chat I am here! DH is working out of town now during the week and I just have such a hard time sleeping when he isn't here!\u00a0\u00a0I'm here if you need me!!",

    "question": "The doctor is concerned about the gestational diabetes, and the baby's weight, so he has ordered a biophysical profile on Friday.\u00a0\u00a0I am nervous, I probably shouldn't be, but if he does not score high enough they will deliver. The doc keeps telling me he is happy with everything (diabetes doc was impressed with my numbers last friday, yeah), but still ordered the test. My mil worked with him on L and D at the hospital for 20 years, and says he is being careful and sure everything is okay.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I should be grateful he is being so cautious, and count my blessings, and I am....I am just scared.\u00a0\u00a0I will be a nervous wreck until Friday.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and I gained 2 1/2 pounds, so I am up to 7 1/2 total now.",
