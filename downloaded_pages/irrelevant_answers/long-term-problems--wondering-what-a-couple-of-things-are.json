            "answer": "The differential diagnosis of nonspecific white matter lesions on an MRI scan of the brain is quite extensive, but in many cases are clinically silent. Common causes are chronic ischemic disease in the setting of stroke risk factors (such as high blood pressure,diabetes, and a predisposition to blood clotting disorders),inflammatory disorders, tumor, and certainly demyelinating disorders such as multiple sclerosis. Other demyelinating disorders include acute diseminated encephalomyelitis which is an autoimmune phenomenon that occurs after an infection such as a cold and congenital diseases that affect the nervous system's ability to produce myelin. Those typically manifest earlier in life and are quite dramatic in presentation.Although they may not be related to the lesions seen on the MRI, your symptoms of episodic slurred speech and facial weakness do sound as if they need to be looked into further by your physician. Depending on your medical history, they could represent a number of neurologic possibilities such as stroke, seizures, or migraines.\u00a0\u00a0Your physician should be able to direct you to a proper diagnostic workup. Good luck!",

    "question": "HiI am trying to find out a couple of things are. I have been diagnosed with two white matter lesions, on the frontal lobe, one is near the left lateral ventricle, I was wondering can these types of lesions be removed? I previously had a brain tumor removed in the left petrous region.I have had difficulty with pins and needles in my hands and feet, sluggish movements at time, slurring of my speech and a drooping of the side of my face. When this happens my sight has also been affected.It stated in my mri report that I might have some type of demlyinating disease, the doctor has ruled out MS, what other types of dymylinating diseases are there?I apologize for all the questions, I am just trying to get a general understanding for what is going on. I am on several medications, synthroid, premarin, mysoline, trazadone, covera, acculate, clonidine.I have also been diagnosed with neurocardiogenic syncope and autonomic dysfunction, I have had many surgeries because my body for some reason develops tumors, that become big enough that they have to be removed.Thank you for any answers or directions you can point me. This forum I have been watching for about a year, its a wonderful service.",
