            "answer": "Thanks for your reply AJ.\u00a0\u00a0It didn't mention anything about being vaccinated just that surface was negative and that Hep B was negative. Maybe I should ask my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0But most likely I was not vaccinated..I'm wondering if I was possibly infected 2 1/2 months ago, would it be too late to get the vaccination now?Also I understand that 95% that get this as an adult, develop antibodies and become immune.\u00a0\u00a0Is this true?",

            "answer": "I've not ever heard that, but hep b prevalence is very different in different countries.Because of vaccines, hep b is becoming far less common.And if you are negative thus far, it would be a good idea to talk to your doc about vaccination.If you have no antibodies, you haven't been vaccinated.AJ",

Once a person has recovered, they are no longer contagious and are immune to future hepatitis B infections.andhttp://www.emedicinehealth.com/hepatitis_b/article_em.htmAbout 90-95% of people who are infected are able to fight off the virus so their infection never becomes chronic. Only about 5-10 percent of adults infected with HBV go on to develop chronic infection.I've also read it on cdc.gov but couldn't remember where i found it there.",

            "answer": "Oh that doesn't mean that 90% will get it.\u00a0\u00a0That means of those that are infected, 90% will be able to recover, and not have it become chronic.That means if you get it, there is a 10% chance that it would be chronic if you are otherwise healthy (as in no HIV, diabetes, or in some other way immunocompromised).Does that make sense?AJ",
