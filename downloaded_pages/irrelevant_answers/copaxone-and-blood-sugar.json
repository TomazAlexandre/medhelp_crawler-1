            "answer": "Solumedrol is known to cause problems with the A1C counts - increases in sugar levels on steroids are common.\u00a0\u00a0Were you predisposed to diabetes before you were diagnosed with MS?\u00a0\u00a0It may be just coincidence that your sugar is up, but well worth having the discussion with your doc.\u00a0\u00a0Can you get information from SS about the 1% and share that with your neuro?\u00a0\u00a0If you suspect the copaxone is to blame, your instinct might be right.Is the oral med you are referencing a drug for sugar control?good luck, Laura",

            "answer": "Hi Laura,Once I emailed my Neuro to advise that I wasn't the first patient ever to tell them it was causing an increase they called SS for information. I knew the Solumedrol was the cause at first, but it's going on July now - do you think it could still be the reason it's higher than normal?Yes, the oral med I was referencing was for type 2. I guess I will continue to be patient. I don't want to switch DMDs.............thanks for listening. LOL",

            "answer": "one would think it has been long enough for the steroids to quiet, but it also could have been the catalyst to set off your type 2 diabetes some way. I hope you can regain control, and soon.",

            "answer": "You are so very smart Laura. Like my friend, Immesco (spelling), I enjoy your posts and agree with everything you say! You are very informative to us newbies, we need all the help we can get :)I spoke with Shared Solutions who reported the side affect to the FDA during my call and are going to follow up in a month. I really don't want to change drugs as this is the only side affect I'm having with the Copaxone and I don't feel physically bad. I really appreciate your thoughts and input!",

            "answer": "This has more to do with thinking it through and not smartness.\u00a0\u00a0I tend to be the simple thinker here- more in practical thoughts than the scientific angles.\u00a0\u00a0Even though Shared Solutions is reporting the side effect, you should think about going to your primary care physician and have your sugar levels monitored.\u00a0\u00a0We like to blame all of our health problems on MS but it ain't necessarily so.\u00a0\u00a0Please get it checked out\u00a0\u00a0thoroughly and don't let the diabetes get out of control.",

            "answer": "I only had one 5-Day Infusion treatment of Solumedrol when I was first diagnosed and it spiked my blood sugar. This through me for a loop since I am normally hypoglycemic. My sugar returned to normal after the the steroid treatments ended and I haven't had any issues with high blood sugar since. I would have to agree with Lu here on this one and say you really should contact your doctor about your new consistently numbers. They could be due to Copaxone, but it may actually be that you may need one of your T2 meds adjusted or changed.",

    "question": "I found the forum a couple of months ago when searching if Copaxone increases blood sugars. The thread I found was from 2008. My sugars have\u00a0\u00a0been so under control and no AIC's over 5.4. I was off meds for a month after my the delivery of my daughter and was still so under control that my PCP decided not to refill my Rx.After 3 months of Copaxone my morning fasting sugar is still high anywhere from 120-150. They have always been in the 70's and during my pregnancy, my highest reading was 99. I feel like I'm treating the MS at the expense of something else.I have spoken with Shared Solutions who have agreed they have heard this complaint before but it's in less than 1%. It's so rare that my Neuro is in denial that its the Copaxone; however, this has been the largest change in my lifestyle in the past 3 months.I don't want to change medications; I don't want flu like symptoms nor depression. Has anyone else had this problem and if so, what was your resolve?Many thanks in advance.",
