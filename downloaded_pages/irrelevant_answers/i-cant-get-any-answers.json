            "answer": "Hi, hopefully you find answers. Like I mentioned you could get screened for metabolic disorders like hyperthyroidism and diabetes. If other conditions have been ruled out then it could be that you have an increased metabolic rate which could be preventing you from gaining weight. But usually skinny people have a genetic predisposition to like foods that are not fattening. You could start by keeping a diary and noting down the food you normally eat. Next slowly start increasing by say 500 calories per day. Maintain this for a week. Next increase by another 500 calories till you reach the desired weight. It is important that you substitute and eat healthy food like protein rich food. Also exercise helps build up muscle mass, so enroll in a good workout program. Good luck with your therapy. Regards.",
