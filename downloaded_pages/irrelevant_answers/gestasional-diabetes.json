            "answer": "I would get a second opinion. Have another dr there or at a diff hospital look over the test results. With the 3 hour I think normally they want all 3 passed or at least 2 and I know my dr said sometimes she'll go ahead and see how much higher they were but usually they monitor with diet and exercise first and medication later. Maybe even talk to ur dr and ask if there's anything u can do before medication to help",
