            "answer": "You don't say what your numbers are normally, it would help for us to know this. I agree with the doctor, being hypoglycemic for that long would have led to some serious problems. This happens when the body is producing too much insulin, your glucose is being released too slowly into the bloodstream, or your glucose is being used up too quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Idiopathic hypoglycemia occurs for no known reason and the person doesn't have diabetes, but it would still cause some serious problems for you. Your blood sugar can spike during the night due to hormone levels.\u00a0\u00a0Food makes our sugar rise and the type of food can make it rise even higher.\u00a0\u00a0There are ways to help control this, by eating several small meals of complex carbohydrates, fat and fiber throughout the day, and include extra exercise as well. I wouldn't tackle this on my own, I would see an Endocrinologist for a complete evaluation of your endocrine system and testing to determine what, if anything is causing this. He/she can also refer you to a nutritionist if nothing is found to be wrong and your diet needs to be adjusted to manage the amount of sugar in your system.\u00a0\u00a0All the readings you have listed are high, it would be interesting to know what your numbers are when they are low.\u00a0\u00a0For diabetics, their sugar spikes due to either not enough medication and/or insulin or eating foods high in carbs.\u00a0\u00a0See an Endo and go from there, even if everything checks out okay, this needs to be controlled to keep you healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

            "answer": "oh sorry haha befor i spiked high levels with my second pregnancy my sugar had never tested higher than 114 and i usually sat around the mid 80s when i was feeling normal. the lowest i ever tested it at was 34. the only problems that it caused me really was that i had to constantly carry sugar around with me for emergencies and i would pass out randomly despite what i had eaten. i went to an endo when i was pregnant and they tested me negative for diabetes and neg for hypothyroid but that was about a year ago. at that time my fasting glucose was 119. its super frustrating because i have been told so many times that there has to be a reason for this but they cant find anything. thanks for your thoughts!",

            "answer": "A fasting glucose of 119 is high, as is 114.\u00a0\u00a0Have they checked you for a pancreatic tumor which causes low blood sugar? Blood sugar that repeatedly rises and falls happens in a pre-diabetic person who is insulin resistant. You produce enough insulin but your cells aren't absorbing it.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, someone more knowlegable than myself can enlighten both of us on this.",

            "answer": "he had mentioned the tumor initially but couldnt test for it while i was pregnant and then my numbers were so much higher after i had the baby that he thought it was gone and so why bother getting to the root of it.",

    "question": "i am 27 years old now and was diagnosed with hypoglycemia at age 4. it has been a significant problem from then on until my second child was born a year ago. ive monitered my glucose levels randomly and they had never gone above 114 until my second pregnancy when they started spiking. i have been tested negative for diabetes, and they hypoglycemia seemed to have diapeared after the second pregnancy. however, the other day i was overwhelemed with the feelings of passing out when i got up in the morning and i grabbed my meter and was at 124 without having eaten anything yet, and then today i had an egg and toast for breakfast, a protein bar and a latte and started feeling sick so i tested again and was at 215. i ate a string cheese and tested again and was at 108. any theories here? im stumped. every dr ive been to says theres no way i could have been hypoglycemic for such an extended amount of time without another reason and i do not nor have i ever had an eating disorder. diabetes does run in my family and my grandmother was thin and diabetic. what should i do?",
