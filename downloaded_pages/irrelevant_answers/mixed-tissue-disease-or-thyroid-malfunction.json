            "answer": "Thyroid disease is often an auto-immune disease, but not always.Auto-immuned diseases tend to accumulate, such that if you have one, the chances of having two or three in ten years are fairly high.I don't think you can say auto-immune thyroid disease is the root of other auto-immune diseases, although in a way it is.You can develop Celiac Sprue and then years later develop Hashimoto's. You can develop Lupus and then farther down the road develop Hashimoto's, and then Rheumatoid Arthritis.Auto-immune thyroid disease does not necessarily precede any other auto-immune disease.At the same time, auto-immune thyroid disease does often lead to further health complications like Rheumatoid Arthritis, Carpel tunnel(sp?), anemia, calcium loss from the bones, reduced blood platelet production in the marrow, diabetes, digestive disorders, chlosterol problems, heart complications, do I need to go on?And many times it is another auto-immune disease.You sound like many of your diseases are tied to thyroid disease. Your test numbers show you Hypothyroid. Do you have a history of thyroid disease?You should have a Free T4 test.Antibody tests; Thyroid Peroxidase antibody (TPOab), and thyroglobulin antibody (TGab)You have the medical picture of someone who has had untreated thyroid problems for a long time.",

    "question": "I have been treated for 8 years for Primary antiphospholipid syndrome, 4 years MS. Now MS is rediagnosed as Mixed Tissue Disease. I googled it and read that I should make sure that my thyroid is functioning optimally. I have multinodal goiter with s&s of hypo -TSH this week is 11.48. My GP is going to have T4 checked and call me Monday. Can thyroid problems cause other autoimmune disease symptoms? I have 14 white matter lesions in my brain, oligioclonal band cells in csf lots of neurological symptoms that just keep increasing. I haven't been able to work for 41/2 years now. I have gained 70lbs. Over the last 30 years I have been dx with Raynauds, Polymyalgia Rheumatica, Interstitial Cystitis, Rosaecea, Ulcerative\u00a0\u00a0Colitis (which I control with a gluten free diet) Asthma (I was also low in Alpa1 Anti-trypsin)and food allergies. I don't mean to take up too much of your time, but I am trying to find out if thyroid disease can be the root of autoimmune diseases. What tests should be done? Thankyou.",
