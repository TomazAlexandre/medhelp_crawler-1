            "answer": "Those changes\u00a0\u00a0are not consistent with simple myopia, changing too fast. Some possibilities: 1. undiagnosed diabetes, if you have symptoms or family history you should be blood tested for it with A1c test 2. corneal disease such as keratoconus 3. contact induced corneal edema.My advise would be to stop wearing the contact lens and make an appointment with a corneal ophthalmologist specialist to rule out these problems. You should take in a copy of your eye recrods from your present \"eye doctor\".JCH III MD",

    "question": "I am a 29 yr old female and have had annual eye doctor visits for years. I am wondering what the cause for sudden, large scale drops of diopter can be at my age. My doctor doesn't offer an answer. When I was pregnant with my daughter (3.5 years ago) I noticed a -2.0 drop in each eye. Subsequently, when my son was born 15 months ago, my eyes followed the same prescription change, dropping my diopter almost another 2 points in each eye.I am no longer pregnant, and have not nursed in a year. Last year when I went to the eye doctor, my prescription was -7.50 in one eye, and -5.75 in the other. 2 weeks ago, I literally watched my vision worsen within a matter of 4 days. I waited 2 weeks and went to the eye doctor when it didn't improve. The eye that had been -7.5 was now -8.25 and my -5.75 eye was down to -7.50.I know my pupils are 8.2 and 7.6. Also, my corneal tissue is 590 and 600. Not sure if that helps, or matters.I wear ProClear soft lenses and have the following medical conditions.My medical conditions are:Hashimotos (immune system attacks thyroid)De Quervain's (arthritis in wrists)Demagraphish (hives form when skin is touched)AsthmaI'm just wondering if I should be concerned or looking into health problems that could cause this.Thank you very much for your time.",
