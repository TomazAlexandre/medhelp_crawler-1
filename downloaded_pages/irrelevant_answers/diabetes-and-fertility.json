            "answer": "Congratulations on trying to conceive! I was being treated with Metformin for my diabetes risk and irregular cycles. For women, Metformin can also make them super fertile (odd side effect) while regulating blood sugars. I'm not familiar with men and fertility issues, so I did a quick search and found this:Male Infertility & DiabetesDCS: What about diabetes and infertility as it is related to males? Does it cause fertility issues in men, too?Dr. Falcone: Yes. Certain diabetes complications can cause issues for men that contribute to infertility. For example, nerve damage from diabetes, multiple sclerosis or a spinal cord injury can lead to retrograde ejaculation \u2013 where the semen goes into the bladder. Since the semen never reaches the female reproductive system, infertility may be an issue. Erectile dysfunction, or the inability to achieve an erection, is another diabetes complication that can lead to fertility problems for men.I also had the Mirena IUD removed recently and fertility doesn't always come back as quickly as the advertisements say. I didn't start ovulating again until 5 months after I had it removed, and I only had it in there for 6 months.",
