            "answer": "Actually with low blood sugar the best thing is an increase in protien. I keep a block of cheese on hand and if mine starts to drop then I slice off a piece and lay down with some water a few mins and it clears up. I have dealt with low blood sugar in all 3 pregnancies now but was not diabetic...oh and my dr suggested powerade or Gatorade to help keep then stable.",

    "question": "I passed my diabetes test a couple weeks ago but at my last appointment my doctor told me I have low blood sugar. She didn't tell me much other than to up my protein. But should I up my sugar slightly too? I know I get lightheaded too. I'll pop a hard candy in my mouth and feel better. Any suggestions? Has anyone else delt with low blood sugar?",
