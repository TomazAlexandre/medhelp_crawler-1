            "answer": "Yes, I agree. Have him call the hepatologist and get this checked out right away.\u00a0\u00a0There are so many different possible reasons for this symptom.\u00a0\u00a0Treatment can cause blood sugar problems, so it could be related to blood sugar and circulation.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of medications can cause numb or cold hands and toes, so it could be another medication not specifically related to treatment (if he's on any).\u00a0\u00a0People with Hepatitis C are prone to cryoglobulinemia, which is a blood condition that can cause some changes in the skin and vascular system.\u00a0\u00a0Peripheral artery disease or vascular insufficiency could cause some symptoms like this.\u00a0\u00a0Peripheral nueropathy can be a side effect of treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Whatever the cause is, he will need to be very careful not to burn or otherwise injure his hands or feet when they are numb as the loss of sensation can result in a serious injury and depending upon the cause of the numbness can also lead to wounds that won't heal properly.\u00a0\u00a0Have him call his hepatologist tomorrow morning.Advocate1955",
