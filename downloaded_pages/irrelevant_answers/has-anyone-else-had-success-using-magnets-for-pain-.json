    "question": "I have a number of pain causing physical problems......arthritis, degenerative spine disease, diabetes, etc. For a number of years I\u00a0\u00a0woke up with severe pain in my toes for which I have found that magnetic rings worn on the toes involved stops and or prevents this pain from occurring. I also use them to stop pain in my fingers during the day. Since the onset of my type 2 diabetes I have been using magnetic bracelets to help prevent swelling in my ankles.Since my success in this method has been so beneficial I hate to think that I am alone in using this method which apparently has no serious side affects and so many uses.",
