            "answer": "Waiting for solid answers when some weighty possibilities have been mentioned has to be the hardest thing. Hopefully after the MRI they'll give you any results in a timely manner. You know, all those symptoms don't have to come from a singular diagnosis. Maybe they do, but you really could have a few different more minor conditions at work. Have you been evaluated for the individual symptoms? For instance, the thirst - checked for diabetes? The difficulty swallowing - been evaluated by an ENT doc? Sleep issues - had a sleep study? Fatigue - Thyroid, diabetes, sleep disorders, anemia been checked? Memory trouble - common with some sleep disorders. Anxiety - not unusual with some sleep disorders. What about meds - could any of your symptoms be side effects of a med? I've had a med cause involuntary movements. I have a sleep disorder called Periodic Limb Movement Disorder, and the trouble it caused with my legs and lower back had the doctors stumped for a long time. Sometimes the answers can be elusive, but the process to diagnosis is often by process of elimination. Hang in there till you get answers.",

            "answer": "We've been through the process of elimination and its been an ongoing thing for a few months now trying to find out the diagnosis so to speak. Its truly a nightmare and time consuming. I will be prescribed a med called Levo something and if the tremors stop we know its PD and if they don't stop we know that it is not PD. I just want answers so that I can get on with things and I have two children and a husband and this is very scary if you know what I mean and Im sure that you do. Thank you so much for your input it really means a lot!",
