            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.There are several forms of diabetes insipidus. Neurogenic or Central diabetes insipidus can be caused by pituitary tumors. The symptoms of Central DI are excessive urination and extreme thirst. It differs from diabetes mellitus it that glucose does not spill over into the urine.You don't mention in your question what medication you were taking. Commonly central DI is treated with desmopressin.\u00a0\u00a0Desmopressin works by limiting the amount of water passed in the urine.I don't know why you would suddenly notice a decrease in your symptoms after 34 years. I would recommend making an appointment with your regular doctor to see what might be causing this. Until you can be seen, it is important that you remain aware of your fluid intake and output. The concern with DI is the risk of dehydration and a decreased potassium level.Good luck!Cathy",
