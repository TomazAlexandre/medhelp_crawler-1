            "answer": "I'm not sure I can be of much help, but I also have had a lot of lower back, hip, leg and foot painI have felt the same symptoms, but most of my foot pain concentrated in the big toe to the middle toe, however the whole foot is fairly numb. Have they done an MRI to see if there is compression on that L5 root caused by a disc or vertebrae, or even a CT scan. I have also had EMG's and Myelograms to help with the diagnosis. Mine has been different at different times. A ruptured disc, a shifted vertebrae, a tumor inside the spinal cord, a tethered spinal cord. I would start with some testing to get to the bottom of the problem. Those shocks can be aweful can't they? Better to look in to it before you get too much nerve damage and a lot of drop foot. Just know that there are others here who care and share some of the same problems.",

I want to let you know that there are NO Doctors on this Forum, only CP\u00a0\u00a0{Chronic Pain}\u00a0\u00a0Patients that help each other with our OWN expertise and experiences that we have developed through our OWN CP Issues.I'm so VERY sorry to hear what you are going through!!!\u00a0\u00a0I KNOW how difficult it is when you are having such pain and you are trying to get it under control!!BEFORE you make ANY decision to stop ANY treatments you need to talk with your Doctor!!\u00a0\u00a0You MUST remember that NONE of us on here are Doctor's and we try VERY hard to keep from making ANY suggestions that ONLY a Doctor ALONG with you can make. :)\u00a0\u00a0You have SO many different conditions going on that it's VERY difficult to tell WHAT might be going on with you.I can tell you this much, I lost my husband to Diabetes and I KNOW that Neuropathy can be a side effect of the Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Is there ANY chance that you could be experiencing that in your legs?\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever been tested for Neuropathy in your legs and feet?\u00a0\u00a0I KNOW that my husband had the VERY same symptoms that you do and he had SEVERE Neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I HOPE that if you HAVEN'T checked into it that you will!!\u00a0\u00a0His pain was there all the time BUT even worse at night time.\u00a0\u00a0He would cry at night sometime because the pain WOULDN'T let up at all!!\u00a0\u00a0There was nothing that I could do to help him and I felt totally helpless.\u00a0\u00a0:{Do you have arthritis in your hip?\u00a0\u00a0Do you need a hip implant?\u00a0\u00a0The reason I ask this is because I have had 3 Total Hip Implants in my left hip in the past 30 years. My arthritic pain from my hip made my leg feel like I had bone cancer!!\u00a0\u00a0NOTHING relieved it and at night it was terrible as I couldn't sleep at all.There are a NUMBER of things that you need to check out IF you haven't already done so, that COULD be contributing to this pain that you are having.You have SO much going on and I HOPE that you will consider going to a PM {Pain Management} Doctor IF you don't already have one.\u00a0\u00a0You need to get the BEST Pain Management that you can AND that you deserve!!PLEASE stay in touch with us and keep us updated on what you find out AND how you are doing!!I will be looking for your update.\u00a0\u00a0:)I WISH you the VERY best.................Sherry\u00a0\u00a0:)",
