            "answer": "I just got diagnosed borderline, it's really given me a wake up call. I have been eaten better recently, but getting the diagnosis has smartened me up. If you are already on a blood pressure med, I would take this seriously, kids don't get high blood pressure unless they have bad eating habits and predisposition to diabetes. I would recommend you see a nutritionist and get tested.\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know what you are going through are \"sugar dumps\" where your blood sugars drop after having high carb food.",

            "answer": "Sounds like you might have hypoglycemia when your body produces too much insulin when you eat carbs. (Diabetics are hyperglycemic) So if you eat pancakes you get the quick sugar rush but then you suffer a low.\u00a0\u00a0You feel bad, eat more, triggering more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0It is closly related to diabetes and you can pass out from it. The test is the same one they use for pregnant mothers.",

            "answer": "There's an early stage of diabetes in some people that also involves hypoglycemia. A person eats something that raises the blood sugar too high. The body is still capable of producing insulin (but late - the phase one response is already damaged) and then puts out so much insulin causing your glucose levels to drop significantly, sometimes too much. Stop eating those foods that cause your body \"to tremble very bad and feel weak and lightheaded and very tired.\" Go see a doctor today.",
