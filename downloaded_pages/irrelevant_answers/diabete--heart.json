            "answer": "Your father is doing the best possible control of his diabetes, diet and moderate exercise. I'm not educated in the homeopathic Gharelu methods so I can't comment on it. But your post leads to several questions.Is your father living in the United States or India?\"On his recent visit to doctor, he suggested him to start take insulin injection of low qty, reason being he told him that because he is not taking any medicines, his heart is becoming weak day by day(No physical test being conducted to determine same) .\"Did you have a follow up conversation with the doctor to determine how he/she came to the conclusion of needing insulin and it helping a weak heart without running any tests? Call and talk with the doctor ASAP.\u00a0\u00a0If you feel you're not getting straight answer go get another opinion and dump the first one. If your father hasn't had one recently ask to have an HgbA1c (hemoglobin A1c) test. This test measure the glucose on new red blood cells over the past three months. This is what doctors use to determine diabetes and how much the patient has it under control. Test results is in percentage where normal is Transplant>Heart>Transplant by Donor Type, Center. I chose transplant because its first on the list to provide a list of teaching centers. Find the center then ask to be referred to it. Be sure to get a copy of the test results and be present so you can discuss any issues found with the doctor. Second hand information doesn't always get passed correctly or in full order.Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi, Thanks for this wonderful forum.My situation is that, my father is a diabetic patient from around 12 yrs. He is controlling is sugar level from his diet and other herbal methods(Ghrelu methods). Although he is visiting doctor and checking his sugar level twice every month, based on results he alter his daily routine, i.e. diet control, morning walk etc. On his recent visit to doctor, he suggested him to start take insulin injection of low qty, reason being he told him that because he is not taking any medicines, his heart is becoming weak day by day(No physical test being conducted to determine same) . All i want to know should he start taking insulin or not, because as per my knowledge insulin should be last medicine for every problem. Is there a real danger for diabetic patients(10+ yrs) of getting heart diseases even if they are living there normal life?Please help me out as i love my father very much and i don't want to take undue chances from his health.",
