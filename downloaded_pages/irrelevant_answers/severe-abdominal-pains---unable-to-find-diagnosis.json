            "answer": "I would think since your husband\u00a0\u00a0has had his colon and stomach examined by endoscopic instruments,there is not many more places to examine. I am sure the Gastroenterologist who performed the tests mentioned the digestive disorders of Crohn's disease, Irritable Bowel Syndrome, Ulcerative Colitis. For your information, there is a federal website that lists and describes digestive disorders and diseases from A to Z. For piece-of-mind, go to http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov, and click on Digestion or Digesive link and read about the many disorders your husband may have already experienced. If you wish, begin with letter A and read to letter Z.I have had neuropathy in the soles of my feet for 5 years. It sounds strange, but I take medication that is primarily for mental conditions that also helps for neuropathy. The medication is named, \" Amitriptyline HCL, 50-mg.\" This medication helps about 50%, but is the only medicine that helps me.Good luck.mcdee708",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Your husband could be suffering from an inflammatory bowel condition such as Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Other than that it could be due to H pylori infection. It can also be food intolerance. Diabetes can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence proper treatment and control is necessary. Changing to another drug may help. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Constipation can also cause bloating. Very sedentary lifestyle is another cause.Since I cannot examine your and know other related conditions he may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. He definitely needs to see a GI specialist. Take care!",
