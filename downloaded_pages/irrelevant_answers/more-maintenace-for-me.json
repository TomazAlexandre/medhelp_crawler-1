I did bring it up with my doc and he said he'd be watching me closely.I suppose I need to research my actual problem (insulin resistance) and the different meds out there since I don't know much about diabetes and or my particular problem. Friole, thank you for your words of support. You certainly are appreciated! Giddyup",

    "question": "Hi all, My computer and salary have been down so I've been using the Library computer.I saw my doc the other day. He put me on a beta blocker in hopes of halting my developing varices.I also take a diabetic drug called actos because my doc says my liver isn't managing sugar levals right. My doc says he' try a new tx when he thinks there is a good one for me.He is very positive about maintenanceand believes it's the best route for me for the forseeable future I'm waiting for my pcr and expect it to be low compared to my usual pre maintenance 2mil.I've been on maintenance for a year now.Sometimes I get really bad sweats but thats pretty much the worst of it.I'm stage 4 43 years old. Good health fellow heppers!-giddy",
