            "answer": "Hi!The simplest reason could be faulty footwear. Even if the child does not have any apparent problems, if he has \u2018hot heels\u2019 then the following conditions should be looked into: diabetes, Sjogren\u2019s syndrome, peripheral neuropathies, hypothyroidism, lupus, peripheral artery disease, sarcoidosis, and high blood pressure. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
