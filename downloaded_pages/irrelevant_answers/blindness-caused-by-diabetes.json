            "answer": "I'm not sure Retinopathy can be reversed once the damage is done, but it's believed it can be prevented by good control.\u00a0\u00a0'Nonproliferative retinopathy' is when it's in it's beginning stages and if diagnosed early, treatment might be able to stop the progression.\u00a0\u00a0'Proliferative retinopathy' is when damage has already happened, but it can often times be brought under control with Laser treatments.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors at Johns Hopkins have done so much research on this subject.\u00a0\u00a0They believe that genetics plays a part in who will develop Diabetic Retinopathy.\u00a0\u00a0They've also seen that children rarely develop the problem until after they go through puberty.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently the hormones play a part in this as well.\u00a0\u00a0One other thing to add - there's a surgical procedure called a \"vitrectomy\" that has returned sight to many that have lost vision through excess bleeding into the gel in the back of the eye because of Diabetic Retinopathy.\u00a0\u00a0The surgery removed the gel/blood, and replaces it with sterile fluid. Hope this helps. :-)",
