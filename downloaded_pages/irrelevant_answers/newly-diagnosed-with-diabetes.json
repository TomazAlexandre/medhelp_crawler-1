            "answer": "There is a lot of information on various sites on the web about type 2 diabetes and food and weight loss (some of it not too reliable). My suggestion would be to drastically reduce carbs (which is good for glucose control as well) and to eat low fat. So basically protein and healthy vegetables. Exercise is a huge piece of the puzzle for both as well. I don't think there is anything to worry about taking both Metformin and Levothyroxine.",

    "question": "Hi I have told many times in the past that I am pre diabetic as my fasting blood sugars run anywhere from 107 to 118 when cked every three months. Then in January she started testing A1c levels also and said they were high (6.1, and then 6.3. but this last time my fasting level was 118 and my a1c came back 6.5. She said now I was diabetic and put me on Metformin 500 xr once a day and told me to lose weight. I forgot to mention she was concerned I gained 16 lbs within same time period (even with change of diet and exercise). I am also Hypothyroid and on Levothyroxine 115 mg. I have 2 questions, If I take Metformin with evening meal and thyroid in am is there still a chance for interaction? Is there a good diet that works for people who have somewhat high blood sugar level but not at extremes that will help me lose weight. Sorry for the book, but am really concerned as I am a single mom with a 15 yr old still to raise and I must be able to keep working to support both of us.",
