            "answer": "I'm sorry to hear kitty is so sick....I would say get a second, even third opinion from an other vet (a reputable one at an animal hospital) even if you do trust your vet. At the very least it will set your mind at rest.The problem with any treatment that involves chemotherapy, intensive surgery, or other (make you feel terrible to get better) treatment is when it comes to animals, you can't explain to them \"this is for your own good\".So inevitably, they do tend to just give up and die from the treatment itself.So yes, while I have heard over the years of potential experimental treatments for this (which are very expensive, if even available to the public), they also tend to have an incredibly low (almost non existent) success rate, and tend not to make it out of clinical trials.Good luck, and I hope you do hear something positive.",

I started with 4 and 2 of them lived to be 20, so I was hoping ultrasound would show something not serious, but he has tumors throughout which is why he stopped eating. I brought him home and he is on steroids , pain med and anti-nausea pills until I see him worsening and the inevitable happens.For now he is eating and purring next to me on the couch as usual, so I am savoring each moment as I brace myself for the inevitable. At least he will be in good company with his many brothers and sisters and we have had wonderful yrs together...although no matter how many, it is never enough.",

    "question": "My beloved almost 14 year old cat has just been diagnosed with carcinomatosis with hypoechoic masses in the mesentery. My heart is broken and I trust my Vet completely, but I can't help but think that there might be some miracle treatment out there to save his life. He is not in any pain, but does have trouble eating. Our Vet said it is probably a matter of weeks that we have left with him. He is a truly remarkable cat with an uncanny will to live as he was diagnosed with diabetes and was in remission within a month of insulin therapy. Is there anything that we can give him or anywhere we can take him to beat this thing??\u00a0\u00a0Please help. My fiance says I am being selfish and belittling our Vet, but I love him so much I thought after he kicked the diabetes that we would have more time with him.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for for time and consideration. Sincerely and with heavy heart. Tinabean",
