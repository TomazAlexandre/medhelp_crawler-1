    "question": "I went on a short trip and when I came back there was a small rash on my left hand. I knew it was probably an allergy so I left it and thought it'd go away after a few days. Now however, its spread all over my arms and its begining to show on my back and neck. They're small red rashes and spots probably 5-20mm in diameter. They don't itch, but spread. I have no idea what it is. In some of the rashes, it appears the skin at the centre of the rash has dried and died out.I thought it might be contact dermatitis, but its not itchy. And when i searched up other possible causes like rubella - i didn't have any of the symptoms. In fact i have no other symptoms except small rashes as i've described. I've had no headaches, no fever, no runny nose, no sore throat, no cough, no red eyes.",
