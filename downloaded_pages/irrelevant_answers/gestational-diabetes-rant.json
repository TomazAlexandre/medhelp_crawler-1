            "answer": "Thank you im just sick of people saying gestational diabetes is the worse thing that can happen to you. No I was 13 when I was diagnosed with type 2. I got pregnant at 14 (bad choice but we all have them) with a guy who I had been with since I was 12..... hethought I shouldnt be pregnant because of the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He pushed me down 3 flights of stairs. Since then I've been with one guy and we have tried for over a year and it finally happened. Now im 11w4d but I cant give birth how I want. I cant go natural. I have to see four drs twice a week and I could be put on bed rest two months before im even due. I've been admitted to the hospital twice already on bed rest.\u00a0\u00a0And people wanna say that since they have gestational diabetes their world is ending?\u00a0\u00a0Most times it goes away after birth. Mine doesnt. I will have mine till I die no matter how well I take care of myself.",

    "question": "I need to rant like big time to all the pregnant women.Everyone thinks getting gestational diabetes is extremely horrible.\u00a0\u00a0Yes ur blood sugars are to high and now you have to watch your diet. I understand that but gestational diabetes can go away and it doesn't happen until later in your pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Im 18. I have had type 2 diabetes going on 5 years. It was in my genes. I've had to watch what I eat and take shots and pills all these years. I have to check my blood sugars at least 10 times daily. Take shots at least 8 times. So yes gestational diabetes is bad. But there are women who are pregnant with preexisting diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We watch you complain about the gestational diabetes while we are here like god you are so damn lucky. There are complications that come from gestational diabetes but us women with preexisting diabetes have so much more complications and are at high risk as soon as we get the positive test (which in itself is extremely rare and hard for us).Im sorry im ranting at all of you women but y'all get the easy side of it.",
