            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms if there is no rash and you are feeling like bugs biting all over the body, the possibility of peripheral vascular disease needs to be ruled out. They are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please get it evaluated from a doctor.",
