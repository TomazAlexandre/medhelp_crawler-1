            "answer": "Stress raises blood sugar so you have that to deal with for a start. Consider trying a LCHF (low carb high fat) diet and also intermittent fasting. Diet Doctor has some great articles to read through. It's possible stress is affecting your weight but so can diabetes (weight gain or loss).",

            "answer": "I'm sure you don't need your daughter, or me or anybody else to tell you that you are on a very \"slippery slope\".If you don't take time to address your situation, your situation (alarming to my opinion) will sooner or later force you to take time, which may be too late to reverse the damage.It is a miracle that you don't have any other diagnoses, however, this does not mean that because of that you are in\u00a0\u00a0the clear, barring the ones you mentioned.As a matter of fact, you have certain undiagnosed imbalances, which have not brought about any symptoms yet.The onset of disease process, starts long before symptoms\u00a0\u00a0appear.You are still able to prevent any additional serious unwanted health complications, by making some corelifestyle changes.Make time to prepare healthy meals and also to prepare healthy snacks for work from scratch!LCHF as Red Star mentioned and choose organic, fresh and nutritious SINGLE ingredients!Cheez-Its and pepperoni??? Really?I don't even know what that is but it doesn't sound healthy.Your life outside work should be the opposite of the hospital ER. Calm, peaceful, serene and slow paced.Your\u00a0\u00a0weight loss is of some concern.Stress and diabetes are possible factors as Red Star said, but it may have to do more with the effect of\u00a0\u00a0Jardiance, which causes ongoing glucose elimination. Not\u00a0\u00a0designed as a weight loss drug though.When combined with an optimized nutritional plan and some exercise, it will probably work to your advantage.Just watch out for any side effects, specially kidney issues and UTIs.Best wishes,Niko",

    "question": "I am a 54-year-old diabetes patient whose blood sugar is not well controlled although we are currently on a new insulin regimen of 35 units at night. I also take metformin 1000 mg BID and Jardiance once daily.\u00a0\u00a0I was at my heaviest in 2008 at 355 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Over the ensuing years, I have lost very slowly and am now down to 271 lbs as of this morning.\u00a0\u00a0My concern is that approximately a week ago, I weighed in at 287 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0My eating habits have changed some.\u00a0\u00a0I work second shift in a hospital ER so typically only have two meals a day.\u00a0\u00a0I rarely eat \"meals\", choosing to have Cheez-Its and pepperoni or sometimes mixed fruit, cheese, or something else light on the stomach.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is a nursing student and she is concerned about malnutrition.\u00a0\u00a0I have no other symptoms such as fatigue, weakness, altered mental status or confusion, etc.\u00a0\u00a0My only physical symptoms are those cause by osteoarthritis of the knees and hips because of the many years from carrying 300+ lbs of weight.\u00a0\u00a0I do not \"feel\" depressed or anxious although my husband of 26 years did pass in August of 2016 and my sister who has some behavioral health issues, did move in with us in July of 2017.\u00a0\u00a0Could stress cause this type of weight loss?",
