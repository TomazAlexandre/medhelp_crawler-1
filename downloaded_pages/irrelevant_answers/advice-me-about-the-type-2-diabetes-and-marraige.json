            "answer": "Hi,I am sorry you are going through this stressfu time when you would otherwise be happily planning for your future. I hope the following information can help:1) If your fiance has Type 2 diabetes that is recently diagnosed and is now under control, his outlook for life is actually quite good.\u00a0\u00a0There are many individuals who have had Type 2 diabetes for years and years, and do not develop any complications at all. Some do, but there are treatments for that as well. Much of this is\u00a0\u00a0in your fiance's and his physician's hands--good control will help him live a long and healthy life. But he needs to take charge. The natural course of diabetes is for\u00a0\u00a0patients to need more medication over the years, but not necessarily, and even if you do it can be managed with good care and guidance.2)Complications of diabetes are related to having continued high\u00a0\u00a0blood sugars. If they are controlled, there is little risk of complications. The complications include decreased vision/various eye problems, heart disease, stroke, nerve problems, liver problems, kidney failure, digestive problems, frequent infections, amputations, impotence.3)A spouse cannot contract diabetes, so your chances of having diabetes are totally dependent on your own history, lifestyle and family history. It has nothing to do with your husband-to-be.4)Your children will have an increased chance of developing diabetes in the future, but often this can be avoided with weight control, diet changes and good healthcare. But yes, there is increased risk.I hope this helps clear up some information/confusion. Your fiance has a good chance of doing just fine for many, many years.Take care and all the best to you both.",

            "answer": "Thank you Anitha, How do you see the report of my boyfriend. Recent Feb 1, 2008 his Blood sugar level was 90( Fasting)- 110(After\u00a0\u00a0food). Currently he is only having 1/2 a tablet in the day and 1/2 a tablet in the night. Diet under control. Minimum 30- 45 minutes of walking. How do you see this?Also, You have mentioned so many complication of diabetics. Is it that he may have in future or will have at least one of those mentioned about 10-15 years from now? Any ways to prevent developing diabetics for my children (during pregnancy itself or after birth like medications, injection etc...) as you say there are increased chances.How do you see a marriage relationship like us? From my parents end, is the fear valid? Is it worth to drop the proposal for the diabetic as the doctor adviced? This question is not my wish to drop the proposal but my parents thinks so much. Would you like to suggest me anything, you are welcome! Thank you",

            "answer": "Hi,Those numbers you gave for your boyfriend's glucose control are very good, as is his current\u00a0\u00a0exercise daily. The complications of diabetes occur when your blood sugars are not well controlled. So if he keeps the sugars well controlled, he may not develop any complications at all even 15 years down the line. There are other things that need to be kept in check, like blood pressure and cholesterol levels. If he is overweight, losing some weight will be very helpful and may even cure his diabetes at this time. If he is smoking, he should stop.There is nothing specific you can do in terms of medications for yourself or your children to prevent them from developing diabetes in future. During your pregnancy, be sure to get good prenatal care to see if you have any signs of high blood sugars yourself, and if you do they should be treated. Otherwise, there is nothing specific aside from keeping your children healthy and their weight controlled.I am afraid it is not my place to really comment on your relationship overall. In terms of his health and current state of his diabetes based on your information, I think perhaps your parents would feel better if they knew that his outlook is quite good as long as he keeps the sugars controlled.\u00a0\u00a0If they have specific questions they can ask on this forum as well, or send an e-mail to my practice at ***@****.Best of luck to you and your fiance.",

            "answer": "Hi,Some Good news for you all.My boyfriends sugar level is well in control as always been. In his last test, his blood sugar level was at 158 after food\u00a0\u00a0as he had some drinks the previous night.(This scared me as the level should within 140. Am I correct?). Even then, His consumption of tablets is reduced from day and night - 1/2 tablets to just 1/2 a tablet a day. the doctors have promised if the sugar level is well in control, he may stop his medication\u00a0\u00a0after some months. However, he should be well controlled on diet and exercise, avoiding sugars and more. How do you see this? Does this seem to be of any reversal of his diabetes?Diabetes is never the end of life. Its even crazy to think like that. However, still negativity is all around me. I don't know how come the doctors in India have so much negativity about my wedding to my boy friend who is diabetic.They have shocking information to my parents\u00a0\u00a0and also the friends circle of my parents and world can never stop their negativity. They call it reality and facts and uploaded all of those into my parents mind which really worries me. The talks are much scary too. More often, they complain that my decision on choosing the boy is wrong, although I don't feel the same. I don't know where humanity speaks here. Is my decision bad? Cant we live a normal happy life for many years? Is choosing diabetes for marriage is so wrong that will lead to our unhappy life? What is the reality and fact?Is it true that the diabetes will suffer at least few of the complications even if the blood sugar level is well controlled due to consumption of tablets and side effects due to this after few years?Hope you could understand what I'm going through.Please help.Thanks!",

            "answer": "Hi,Diabetes is reversible by good lifestyle, as is happening with your boyfriend.\u00a0\u00a0The 158 value after food is nothing to be very concerned about.So many things in life are not sure. No one can predict what will happen in 10 or 15 years.\u00a0\u00a0 You will be blessed in your marriage and your health because you will both be very conscious about taking good care of yourselves and your family.The ability of your boyfriend to control his diabetes is also a good sign.\u00a0\u00a0You have a partner who will be strong enough to acheive in life what he needs to do.If you love and are happy with eachother and see that you are well suited, please disregard all the naysayers concerns with his health.\u00a0\u00a0Go and have a happy life togheter.Sally",

            "answer": "Hi,I am so sorry I missed your question, it did not come up in que when you write the most recent question.Type 2 diabetes can develop into a type of Type 1 later on IF\u00a0\u00a0the pancreas is not able to keep producing enough insulin. This is not definite and only happens to certain individuals.Complications related to diabetes are mainly from high glucoses and not the medications taken. All medications can have side effects ofcourse, herbals, teas etc included. It is important for your boyfriend and his doctor to keep a lookout for possible side effects of any medications and change to something else if possible. Ofcourse, if his glucoses can be controlled with diet changes and exercise, this is the very best scenario.Take care and good luck.",

Is diabetic reversible ?Can my boyfriend live a life free of diabetes (without medication)?\u00a0\u00a0Will the pancreas reverse to normalcy, so as the boy and health?he his consuming only 0.5 tablet per day.So this means that his pancreas is just below normalcy (minimum). So his blood sugar or glucose level is close to normalcy. So his risk factor and complication due to BS is very minimum or nothing. Am i Correct?",
