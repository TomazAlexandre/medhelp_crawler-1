            "answer": "Elizabeth Jane:From your description, I really can't tell whether what you have is just the thinning which often comes with age, or whether you have a hair or even a hormone problem (such as thyroid.)The actual frequency of hormone imbalances causing hair loss is very low, but I think a visit to your dermatologist would very likely clear up your questions with just an examination and a few simple tests.\u00a0\u00a0That way you'll know whether you're aging, gracefully or otherwise.Best wishes.Dr. R",

    "question": "Dear Doctor, I am loosing scalp hair all over but mostly on my left side there is a developing 6\" area which never grows back normally!\u00a0\u00a0Is it because I sleep on my left side,just aging or a possible disorder?My eyebrows are so scraggly, sparce and the end part has completely disappeared! I always had a full head of hair and other hairy areas so much that my father use to call me his little monkey! Pathetic! However,I am trying to grow in some hair (without the usual plucking to make it look better) so I have something to work with as far as \"hair\" but I still need to add the end part with powder! It just doesn't grow! I do not over pluck my eyebrows! What can cause the loss of the end part of eyebrow hair and be sparce in the front? Of course, the hair grows in places other than you want them to, like the chin!My eyelashes are sparce but started out with full lashes as a younger person up to age 50; however, there are spaces on the lower lashes which never seem to come back in! Do they at my age? I am now \"55\"!!!! Look younger than 55 years; about 10yrs!\u00a0\u00a0I am not a vain person but I do not know how to correct these issues and/or for how long should I do it? I am a believer of aging gracefully but what is gracefully?\u00a0\u00a0Is there a disorder that has these symptoms such as hypothyroid, post-menopausal effects, just aging?\u00a0\u00a0Please respond as to your opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!
