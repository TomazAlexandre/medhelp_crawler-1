            "answer": "Hi,I think that you know that what you are doing is very self destructive. You would not be posting on this forum if you didn't know that.Doing cocaine is bad for anyone.\u00a0\u00a0It is even worse with your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Uncontrolled diabetes kills.\u00a0\u00a0Cocaine also kills!\u00a0\u00a0That is obviously double trouble!Are you on insulin or just tablet medication.\u00a0\u00a0If you are on insulin you are flirting with death every time you take cocaine.\u00a0\u00a0If you are on tablet medication, you are still doing yourself no favours.I recommend that you get out with this crowd that you are with, if it is possible.\u00a0\u00a0 I also recommend strongly that you talk with your doctor, a minister, or any community programmes and see if you can get into rehab.In the meantime, I think you need to reveiw everything you know about diabetes and do everything you can to get it under control.You are too young to be killing yourself this way.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to be so blunt.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes.",
