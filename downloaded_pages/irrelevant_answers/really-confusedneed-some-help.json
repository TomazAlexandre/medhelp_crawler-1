            "answer": "umm...the first time i got a blood test and they just asked if i had a cold sore cuz my test came back abnormal. i have no idea what the differences are between the tests. but like i said the second time they said anything about it i went in for the yeast infection. she just looked at me and said its herpes...she didnt test the swab or nothin, just threw it away. when i was first told i had it i only had i wanna say 2 partners, i was engaged to the first one for 6 years and the second one we were together for i wanna say 5 months at the time but of course i found out maybe last year that he was like the town bus, everyone had a turn. when i had my first \"outbreak\" I had and I know it is bad but I had 5 partners...i never have sex without a condom... well i did one time but literally that is it! And it was with the x fiancee. Everyone I have been with that i could get ahold said they were tested shortly after i talked to them and they came up negative",

I can also look at your first herpes blood test for you if you call to get the results and post them here - e.g. hsv1 igg 4.9 and hsv2 igg 2.3 or whatever they are.",

    "question": "Alright here goes. I was tested positive for herpes last year. now me being the type of person i am i got all the information i could possibly get...I am a little confused though. Can a doctor tell its herpes just by looking at it? I am thinking maybe i could have been mis diagnosed, heres why...I went in for a yeast infection(i thought) It wasnt bad at the time but I have diabetes so i hafta have everything checked out and i get them alot...Doctor told me it was a severe bacterial infection. She gave me a cream and I used it for a few days and then it got worse, hurt so bad to go to the bathroom and take a shower and my legs hurt so I went back thinkin I was havin an allergic reaction to the meds. All she did was look at my \"area\" and told me i had herpes. I have read that herpes tests check for obs. Is it possible that even if i did get tested and it came back positive it could be because i already have obs in my system from my diabetes and other medical ailments? And if i have herpes why is it that nobody else seems to have it and i have not had one \"outbreak\" since I was diagnosed...and its been over a year",
