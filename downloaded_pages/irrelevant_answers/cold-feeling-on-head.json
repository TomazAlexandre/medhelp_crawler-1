            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may occurs due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

    "question": "For the past almost week now, I've had a cold feeling on my forehead and sometimes on the top and back of my head and sometimes it will move to the sides where my temples are as well. It feels as if an ice cold rag is laid on my head. Sometimes it will feel like it's tingling too. At first I tried to ignore it, but it just wont go away. When it first started it would only happen once a day, but today was the first day that it had been going on all day and will not stop. Today is the first time that I feel my nose tingling too. I'm really starting to worry something cold be seriously wrong, I'm only 24 years old. I do not have a headache, or any anxiety just the cold feelings that come out of nowhere.",
