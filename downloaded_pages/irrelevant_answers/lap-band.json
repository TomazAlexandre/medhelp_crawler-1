I have been down to 195 and had no extra skin before but that was on those stupid phen-phen pills. now i gained it all back plus some. I really dont look 350 but i am",

I need to loose 100 obs, so I can breathe easily again and walk easier and live to enjoy my grandbabies.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid because the cost to me here in Canada is 18000$ alot of money, so I need to know it will work, if it does it will be worth the sacrifising but if it might fail because I dont have will power or stamina it will break us.\u00a0\u00a0What is your opinion please?",

    "question": "I am so glad that i found this web site. This forum has offered a great deal of insight on both types as well as experiences from these surgeries. My mother had the RNY bypass surgery and i must say that she has lost 110lbs and looks terrible. Her self esteem is lower than ever. She is very concerned about her appearance and always has been, but it has turned into an obsession! I was exploring my options and will continue to research the Lap Band surgery.I would really like to thank The Ghost for giving us those follow ups, but will you PLEASE let us all know what your current situation is. I am dying to know, I want to hear more!!!I have a few questions.1. After you have dropped the weight you needed to drop can you elect to have the Lap Band removed?2. Are you restricted from running or jogging after you begin to lose the weight? A risk of slippage?3. After the surgery what are your restrictions and for how long? EX; exercise, return to work because I have a labor intensive job.I would again like to thank all of you for sharing your knowledge and experiences with the rest of us, it really has helped!",
