            "answer": "They probably tested you so soon because you were a higher risk for gestational diabetes. I got tested my second appointment and then again at 28 weeks. Just because you didn't pass the one hour test doesn't mean you have gestational diabetes, the three hour test will determine that so there is still hope that you don't have it. If you do have it they will monitor you closely and have you on a special diet/exercise plan. As anniebrooke said google it :)",

    "question": "I'm eight weeks and three days. I went for my first doctor appointment and they took blood and had me drink a super sugary drink and wait their for an hour to test for diabetes. They called me yesterday and said the test was high and they want me to come take a three hour one to see if I have diabetes. They also said I can't eat after ten the night before I go. Could I have diabetes because I'm pregnant? If so will it go away? I'm over weight, Im barely 5'1 and I weigh 180. I've gained a lot in the past year or so. Could that have to do with it? Anyone do this test?",
