            "answer": "After 12 years of infertility, after watching my sisters have child after child, after watching one of my sisters have 2 abortions, after being told we had a better chance of winning the lottery then conceiving a child my mother MOCKS the choices I made for my baby registry. After being diagnosed with gestational diabetes my mother told me to stop complaining about having to check my blood 4xs a day. During a high blood pressure/ proteins in the urine possible pre eclampsia scare my mother shrugged and went up north for a shopping weekend with her sisters. So yeah... I get the whole crazy *** mother thing.",

            "answer": "Wow... Im sorry you have to go through all of that. Why does it seem so hard for people (especially our mothers)just to give us the support we need and stop harassing every move we make? I have a high risk pegnancy as well except the GD. I know somewhat of what you're going through and I hope things get better for you! Im sure your mother would hate to have to stab her fingers 4x a day so she shouldn't be so negative towards anything you're going through! Congratulations on this pregnancy and take it easy!! :)",

    "question": "I know I'm probably over reacting but my mother just pissed me off. I knew this question was on it's way for some time now but she asked me in a sarcastic way if I was sure I wanted to name my son what we are naming him because kids will make fun of him. His name is quite popular here and its a huge family name as well. It's very meaningful to my husband and I love it as well. If I wanted your input, I'd ask for it so since I didn't, keep quiet! Anyone else have someone putting their two cents in where it's not wanted?",
