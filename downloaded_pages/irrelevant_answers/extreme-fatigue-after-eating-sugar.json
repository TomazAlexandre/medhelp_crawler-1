            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The only way to know for sure is to have your blood sugar tested. I would recommend speaking with your doctor about your symptoms. If your blood sugar is elevated, you are going to have to make some dietary changes. You could try making them now and start to decrease the amount of carbs in your diet. Instead of the candy bar, you could try a snack high in protein which will not cause your blood sugar to spike and then drop. Some snacks that are high in protein are hummus, peanut butter, you can dip veggies or fruit. There are also protein bars which are quick and easy like a candy bar. However, be careful with these, many are so loaded with sugar they are candy bars in disguise.I hope this helps.Cathy",

    "question": "What is the difference between the fatigue a non-diabetic person would experience after consuming sugar and the type of fatigue someone with insulin resistance would experience? I figure it's different for everyone, but any insight on some of the general signs of being diabetic would be helpful.I am a 26 year old female with a BMI of about 21-22. I eat a vegetarian (though not particularly healthy - very carb-heavy) diet and am not particularly active. Sometimes after consuming refined sugar I begin to feel so fatigued that I can barely stay awake. Today at work I ate some candy (bad idea) and shortly after was struggling to even keep my eyes open. I was not tired before the candy. This is a recurring issue. My grandmother had diabetes type 2 but neither of my parents do. Just wondering if this could be a sign of insulin resistance/high blood sugar or if this is different than what people with diabetes experience. Also I apologize if I used any of the terminology incorrectly here.Thank you.",
