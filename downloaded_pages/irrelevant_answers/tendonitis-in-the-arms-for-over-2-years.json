            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of your symptoms. Possibilities that may need to be considered include inflammations, degeneration, tendonitis, neuro-muscular causes, joint issues, micronutrient deficiencies etc. I would suggest getting this evaluated by a primary care physician or an orthopedician for an accurate diagnosis and suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "Hello all,I am a diabetes patient for almost 3 years now (not on medication though) and had tendonitis developed on my both elbows almost at the same time when Diabetes was initially diagnosed.About 18 months ago I did physiotherapy for both elbows and got almost better .However this issue has not completely gone away and it keeps coming back .It becomes more apparent whenever I do some lifting .Lifting a 10 lbs bag some times causes pain in my elbows and I feel that muscles and tendons are getting pressed too hard and I feel extreme pain in some cases.In addition ,my Knees have also started to hurt now. Over last few months,I am also exhibiting little noise/creaking when I move any joint in my body including my fingers which is due to friction in my bones/joints .Currently I am studying and dont have medical insurance through my employer .I need to know how serious is my condition and what could be done at this stage .As an FYI I am only 33 years old.",
