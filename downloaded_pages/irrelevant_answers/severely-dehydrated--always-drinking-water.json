But I have traveled and Lived in Florida, Georgia, Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, and Oregon. \"Visited New Jersey\"I will ask my Doc to run a Heavy Metals Panel this week just to rule out that for exclusion.",

    "question": "Hello everyone, I am a 25 year old male who is 5'8 and weigh 230lbs (36%BMI) I have been having trouble where I feel I become very dehydrated very easily and I am drinking lots of water a day (roughly 6-8 quarts).... I notice that when I wake up in the morning or if I go a couple hours without drinking water that my urine is very dark (Apple Cider/Tea colored), Somewhat burns when I output, dry mouth, thirsty, brainfog, facial and body flushing, skin feels hot to touch, out of it, muscles feel very tense and achey..... I have had 3 recent ER visits in the last 4 months for questionable heart arrythmia and panic attacks, which each time was experiencing Sinus Tachycardia, but also each time I was notably dehydrated since each visit they would give me sodium chloride on IV and oral Pedialite which helped with the tachycardia and anxiety.... The most recent visit they did blood work and said that my white blood cell count was elevated and bilirubin levels were also elevated, thyroids were normal as were kidneys. Liver levels were a little high. All of my Metabolic Panels were apparently normal ranges.... the times before that I had one 24 hour UA that showed High Kidney Creatinine levels and also elevated liver ALT on that one... Just had my adrenal glands tested on a serum blood test and UA and I guess that was normal as well... Does anyone know what can be causing this sever dehydration despite how much water im drinking? Diabetes Insipidus?? Kidney Failure?? Liver Problems??I am Diagnosed with:Panic DisorderGeneralized Anxiety DisorderTBI ( Car Accident)Elevated Blood PressureWhiplash SyndromeCervicogenic Migraine and DizzinessPlease any advice would be appreciated.....",
