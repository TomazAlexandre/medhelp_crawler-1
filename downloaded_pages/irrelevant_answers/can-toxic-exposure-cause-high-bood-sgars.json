            "answer": "Thank you for responing\u00a0\u00a0please find details below.1. Home, my husband works from home so was thus exposed 24 hours a day.2. He was diagnosed with diabetes 3 years ago, (no family history at all).3. Prior to the poisoning he weighed 15 stone, over the 5+ years that that he was poisoned he balloned up to 22 stone, since he has come out of the poisoning he has lost over 8 stone, without diating and now weighs just under 14 stone.4. He was urinating frequently a few years ago but now is back to normal.5. The exposure began 8+ years ago and stopped 3 years ago when we discovered the faulty appliance pumping out kerosene products of combustion and kerosene vapours.The cooker is a heat/boiler and is never turned off even during the summer months.We live with electricity only because we have become sensitive to any fumes.Thanks carole",

            "answer": "Hello again Carole,To my knowledge, there are no medical or scientific studies that have established a cause and effect relationship between kerosene vapors or products of combustion and diabetes.In terms of his symptoms, one possibility is that the weight gain several years ago was due to the onset of Type 2 diabetes, which is characterized by insulin resistance, weight gain, polyuria (frequent urination).If he now has lost weight (and may or may not be treated with diabetes medication), his diabetes (and high blood sugar) is likely under better control. As a result, one would expect him to not have polyuria now if his blood sugars are well-controlled.Does your husband take medications for his diabetes?Do you (or your husband's health care provider) believe that the weight loss is due to better control of the diabetes or is the weight loss unexpected? Base on my calculations from your note, he has lost 14 - 15 pounds. Is that correct?~\u2022~ Dr. ParksThis answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical or legal advice.

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply, my husband has lost more than 7 stone over the last 2.5 years, in total and about 4 stone in the last 12 months.My husband had toxicological screening of his blood and urine done 2 years ago and they found various very high levels of metals in both along with volatile organics compounds. these included arsenic, manganese, selenium, nickel, lead and mercury and benzene and toluene in the VOC's. When we had the cooker tested for products of combustion by a forensic environmental expert he found that all of the above were being emitted in to the air he breathed in over the 5+ years that he was exposed.We have found scientific and medical research papers find many links to diabetes and exposure to toxins in particular arsenic and benzopyrene.Does this help?Thanks Carole",
