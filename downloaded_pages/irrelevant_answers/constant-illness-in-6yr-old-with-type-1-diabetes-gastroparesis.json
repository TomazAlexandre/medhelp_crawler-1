I will try what you suggested and and send a link over to her dr's and nurses.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again!",

            "answer": "Welcome to our forum,We're not physicians here but all have experience with diabetes and are happy to share out opinions and suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0Learn what you can here and run the ideas by your child's doctor.I can't tell from your posting if your daughter is being followed by an endocrinologist/diabetologist or \"just\" a general pediatrician.\u00a0\u00a0It's so important for us to have access to specialists, and if she doesn't (yet) my first suggestion is to get a referral to one.\u00a0\u00a0If you're already being followed by an endo, then ask for a referral to a gastro specialist who can focus in on that part of her system.In the short term, try some home techniques ... like don't allow her to lie down/sleep/nap within 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0Elevate the head of her bed (not just pillows under her head) so that while she sleeps, gravity will work with the digestive system to move things down.\u00a0\u00a0Limit her fatty and spicey foods and begin to keep a food/symptom diary with her so you'll begin to see patterns of how she feels relative to what she's eaten and what she's been drinking.Many folks with Type 1 diabetes have or develop other issues.\u00a0\u00a0While our disease *is* an autoimmune disease, it is not immune \"deficiency\" that causes our disease.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, our immune system is hyper (overly) sensitive and that's what's believed to cause our immune system to have attacked our beta cells in the pancreas.Among the issues that diabetics often face is a sensitivity to wheat/gluten and/or dairy foods.\u00a0\u00a0While some folks have a sensitivity or allergy to either/both of these foods, other folks have a medical condition (read about Celiac and Crohns, fore example).\u00a0\u00a0A typical American diet is loaded with both, and you might try eliminating those foods for a while to see if her digestive system begins to work better.\u00a0\u00a0Is your daughter drinking plenty of plain water or other non-sugary, non-carbonated, non-caffeinated beverages?\u00a0\u00a0That's a good habit to get her into.My understanding is that gastroparesis is not evaluated by doing a blood test, but rather it's done by doing a gastric emptying test(s) and perhaps some other techniques that allow the docs to see what the digestive system is doing.Hope this helps some and I hope you'll hear from others, too.",

    "question": "I have a 6 yr old daughter who was diagnosed at almost 5 yrs. old with Type 1 Diabetes. Late last year she started having problems, saying her heart hurt or her throat burned\u00a0\u00a0or she couldnt have a bowel movement but felt she had to and her tummy was hard quite often. After getting her into her diabetes dr who is 6 hrs away he diagnosed her with acid reflux, she is taking prilosec and that has helped somewhat but since then she has gotten sick with mostly stomach viruses and/or strep throat every month since last November. Right now she has not eaten well in the last 4 days saying her tummy hurts if she eats anything beyond liquids or very small items. I have a two questions1) Is it possible acid reflux was an under diagnosis? She seems to have a lot of the symptoms for Gastroparesis, she had blood and urine work done and everything looked good, so I was told.2) Does anyone else have a problem with their child getting sick soooo often, is it possible that she has a weaker immune system that goes beyond the \"immune deficiency\" from being a diabetic?I feel like everytime we get over an illness here comes anotherone. This is my first time posting, thank you all for listening!",
