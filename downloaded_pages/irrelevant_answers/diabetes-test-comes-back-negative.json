            "answer": "Have you had the 5 or 6 hour glucose tolerance test? If all your doctor is relying on is fasting blood sugar he won't get much information. Your symptoms suggest not diabetes, but hypoglycemia, except for the joint and muscle pain, at least I never had the joint and muscle pain.",

            "answer": "I agree. It sounds like reactive hypoglycemia, where high carb foods make your blood sugar go low. Do you have the same thing when you eat say a plate of pasta? If it's just sweets, simple solution: don't eat sweets!",

            "answer": "When you feel a mild hunger, don't go for starches or sweets. Eat protein. At my suggestion, a friend with this problem kept boiled shrimp in the refrigerator and ate one or two when she wanted a snack. People with hypoglycemia (presuming that is what you have) should eat several small meals a day, instead of three squares.",

        {
            "answer": "I agree with the suggestion above that you should have an OGTT to see how you react to carbs. Also google reactive hypoglycemia for more information. The yogurt and tortilla are about 30 grams of carbs, not an enormous amount (assuming the yogurt is plain, not the fruit kind which is sweetened). Yogurt is dairy by the way. Get the test. Meanwhile if you invest in a meter or borrow one you could see what your blood sugar reading is when you feel that way which would give you important information.",
