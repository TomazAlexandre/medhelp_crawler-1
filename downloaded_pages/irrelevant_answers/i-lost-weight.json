            "answer": "My doctor told me that its very common to lose weight during the begining of your pregnancy. I threw up about 3 times and always had morning sickness all day like i felt like i was going to vomit but only actually got sick about 3 times and after about 18weeks it went away but i lost 5 pounds, i ate more than i did before i got pregnant and i got lazy in the beginning and would just lay around the house and watch tv all day because i always felt real sick to my stomach and even tho i was lazier and ate more i still lost 5 pounds, and my doctor told me that was normal so dont stress out about it.",

            "answer": "It is normal to lose weight ESP if (no offense cause.IDK your body build) you're over weight. Its healthy even, surprising I know. My MIL lost 75lbs with my SIL and she very obese, I've seen pics. A lot of Drs recommend it so that you don't become even more over weight and so you don't develop geatational diabetes. If your Dr doesn't seem concerned then its all good! As long as baby is growing healthy then its fine, I mean just don't starve your self Haha cause THATS not good! congratulations on the pregnancy Hun!!!",
