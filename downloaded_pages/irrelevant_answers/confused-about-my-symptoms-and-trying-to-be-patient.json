            "answer": "From all you say, it will be very strange if you have diabetes. So consider this just one of many trials you have to go through to get to your final diagnosis. I'm confident your doctor will be forced to check that one off his list, so heave a sigh and endure it.My neuro recently brought up the diabetes motif as well, and so I had an A1C blood test, which satisfied him. No glucose tolerance, glad to say.I'm sure you were chuckling when you wrote that you're too old for MS. Maybe you feel too old to put up with the hassles of the diagnostic process, and I sure understand that. But as you know, you're not too old for the disease. Wouldn't it be great if we were? Then they could say, \"Nope, that's not it. But here it is--some little glitch that can be healed with 2 aspirin and call me in the morning.\"?ess",

            "answer": "I sure wouldn't give up. It definately does not sound like diabetes to me, but I am not a doctor. I was diagnosed with MS 2 years ago, and I never thought that I could have it, let alone, I had no idea what it was. All of the signs and symptoms you named above sound like what I had when they diagnosed me. However, they believe I have had the disease longer and just attributed the symptoms to something else. Have you had an MRI yet? That is one of the better tests to have, and it is painless. I wish you the best of luck!BH",

    "question": "Hi all,As a newbie here, I have learned so much already, but I am still confused.\u00a0\u00a0My neuro had me go take a 2 hr. GTT and I am waiting for the results. Obviously, she is trying to rule out diabetes even though I have absolutely no symptoms other than peripheral neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone EVER heard of anyone who had numbness as the only symptom of their diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0No thirst, etc. I have been in such a habit of ignoring things and have issues about complaining too much, but now that I know more, I am noticing pains, including the \"girdle\" that I just ignored in the past because it is relatively mild. My feet feel like I'm walking on gravel, my hands...well, less functional and I drop things all the time.\u00a0\u00a0My gait?\u00a0\u00a0I don't know, seems like I am weak in the legs, off balance, and stagger like a drunk. Dizzy spells seem to come and go. The fatigue is horrible because I garden, and I get so worn out after a short time working out there. I also seem to be short of breath, but that might be because I definately don't exercise enough. My heart has been checked out, so I don't think it's about that. Last recent thyroid test shows that my Synthroid dosage is just right. Uggh!\u00a0\u00a0Now I read this over and worry that I am being a hypochondriac!\u00a0\u00a0If it turns out to be MS, I must have had it for a long time, because I keep remembering things that I felt in my body that I ignored years ago...I am \"too old\" for MS!\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for listening, my friends...Mary Kay",
