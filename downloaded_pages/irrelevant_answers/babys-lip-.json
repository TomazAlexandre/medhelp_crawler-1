            "answer": "My 2nd child was born with cleft lip and palette. It was noticeable in my 20 week ultra sound. In the ultra sound it did not look off center. It was a big dark gaping hole. Also I never had any excess fluid, never heard of that being associated with cl/p.\u00a0\u00a0They specifically look for cl/p in ultra sounds.\u00a0\u00a0If they hadn't said anything I really wouldn't worry. If you are still concerned just talk to you doctor about it. Maybe he can pull up your ultra sound and show you where it would be and explain how a cl/p would look be not",

    "question": "I just had a 3d/4d ultrasound for fun and in some of the pictures my babys lip looked a little dark and kinda off center from her nose, the tech said she was pressed against my uterine wall and that is why she looked smooshed but of course I am a little worried about cleft lip. Would my doctor have noticed if it were cleft lip in my anatomy ultrasound or does that not detect them. Im 29 weeks and have had several ultrasounds bc of my age and he has never mentioned it. I also have excess fluid and I have gestational diabetes which can cause excess fluid but so can cleft lip. Anyone have any info that may be useful?",
