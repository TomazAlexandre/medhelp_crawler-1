            "answer": "Quite honestly I encourage you to see another doctor as this is a legitimate question pertaining to your health and well being that you deserve an educated and informed response to.On the other hand your doctor simply may not know.Acute Hepatitis C as you may know only means you were exposed to the virus and you cleared it on your own. Elevated liver enzymes are often a symptom of Acute HCV so if that is the case with you, have they returned to normal values?I encourage you to seek an answer to this. Meanwhile based on what little you have shared in your post and absent any other circumstances (yada, yada, yada) I am not really seeing why you would not be able to drink. Especially since it does not appear Hepatitis C is an issue.",

I know you said your Acute HCV resolved in 2010 and it's probably a non-issue but I was wondering when the last time you were testing for the Hepatitis A, B & C Antibodies.",

            "answer": "Congrats on having resolved the HCV without the need to treat it! As far as your liver goes you should be in very much the same boat as the general population: drinking small amounts on an irregular basis is fine, but be careful not to mix alcohol with other meds. I'd be more concerned about the diabetes, as alcohol is pretty bad for blood sugar levels. Be careful to keep an eye on those levels and be especially careful about drinking on an empty stomach, when it could be absorbed very rapidly.",
