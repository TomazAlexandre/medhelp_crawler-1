            "answer": "The symptoms DO sound very typical of hypoglycemia. I have known people who are not diagnosed with any kind of illness, but who can get so severely hypoglycemic that they can pass out completely for a short period of time. One of my high school friends does this often enough that her co-workers keep orange juice in a frig at her place of work in order to rescue her if they see her looking dazed. I agree that the best thing to do is to get a glucometer and test her when this happens.",

    "question": "my 6 year old daughter has been having unknown seizures since she was 2 years old. she does not get them that often, but she does definately has seizeres and has had every test done to try to find out the problem. she has seen a specialist twice and she has had a blood test. but will hypoglycemia always show up on a blood test? because when she has had her blood tested, it has been at times when she feels fine. no docto has even brought up a the possibility of hypoglycemia or diabeties or anything. but I just have this feeling\u00a0\u00a0the seizures are from her sugar or salt levels spiking sometimes. she often complains of feeling dizzy and gets headaches. i think that i may have the same problem, but i dont know if i actually have had a seizure( i have felt really light headed and shakey at times, or sometimes feel this way from pain such as stubbing my toe or hitting my elbow.i cant say for sure if i have had a seizure or passed out. i just can feel drained all of a sudden and then i wake up on the floor soaked with sweat. this is the same thing i see in my daughter. but i i actually see her seizures. after the seizure she is very tired and sweaty and thirsty. I always get her something to eat & drink.within 30 minutes- 2 hours, she is totally fine. is there a certain doctor type i should have her see.? I am really worried. what should I do??",
