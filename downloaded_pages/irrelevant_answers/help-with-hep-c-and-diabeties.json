            "answer": "Can't answer why, but I believe Bill is correct about exercise elevating liver enzymes. It is usually a precaution not to have strenuous exercise prior to the tests. I think that it is not that exercise is bad, it just causes an elevation in enzymes. Probably has something to do with the liver's function of storing and releasing glucose on demand. This is just my supposition, so don't take it as gospel.",

        {
            "answer": "I don\u2019t really understand either. I think one of the primary liver enzymes, ALT is less specific to liver injury than the other one. Many things can cause it too increase, one of them being muscle damage. I think it increases in the event of a heart attack too; muscles apparently release several enzymes/proteins when they\u2019re damaged.I don\u2019t think exercise is bad in any way; but if you have just done a big session of weight training, say; it might not be good to do a liver function test shortly afterward.Diet and exercise remained key components in diabetes type II management; although sometimes I wish they weren\u2019t :o).Bill",
