    "question": "My right knee & on the right side in the soft part feels numb & if I get it against anything or kneel on the floor on my knee it feels like I put my knee on something sharp or it can feel like I put it on a nails & it can really hurt, I can rub my knee I can touch my knee firmly, even smack it & it does not bother it, it only shows these symptoms when I get against something or\u00a0\u00a0kneel down on it, its weird but its me so it would be.lol.. I thought maybe a form of neuritis but I don't know, I did nothing to my knee to cause this...Sometimes if I get against something in a certain way I feel the sensation of something rolling inside I want to say like a vein maybe...It is just weird... If I run my fingers over the spot it feels numb...I am just curious about it.....Thanks...Lee",
