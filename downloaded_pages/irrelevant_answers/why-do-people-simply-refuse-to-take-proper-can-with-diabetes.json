            "answer": "Hi there!It is great to hear about your mom and I really wish that we all had the same determination to continue in life despite the hardships. Diabetes per say is not a disease but just a deficiency of either insulin or its action and we should consider ourselves fortunate to have lived at a time when it can be well managed and appreciate the life God has given us. All humans have a tendency to sympathize themselves without realizing that there are worse things in life and there are people who struggle just to survive.Anyhow wish her a healthy and beautiful life!Take care!",

            "answer": "I'm guessing your mom was around 30 or so when diagnosed? I am a type 1 and have had it for 12 years now. I am 20. Besides myself my youngest sister and older brother also have it. I understand that there are people who wonder why not take care of yourself? For me I have both the determination as well as the set backs that come along with it. In march I became pregnant and have always thought my chances were slim. I miscarried in april and ended up in critical care because of ketones. I was devistated even though my a1c dropped from an 8.9 to 7.8 in 3 months. Other then the fact of Having problems with concieving I also have to worry about making enough money to support the cost of diabetes. The stress of working hard makes the thought of living unbearable and even though I want to live and want to take care of myself I don't. Its great to hear about your mom but since she has been diagnosed if I'm correct has probably had so much motivation to keep living because of maybe children or a husband. And sometimes people have a hard time taking care of it for many reasons. Hopefully I will end up like your mom living to see my 94th birthday with great control of my diabetes. However like I said the decisions people make have so many different factors.",
