Most likely your symptoms could be due to vitamin deficiency, injury to a nerve, pressure on spinal/peripheral nerves (neuropathy), lack of blood supply due to cholesterol plaque from atherosclerosis in the extremities, viral infection and use of certain medications.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, atherosclerosis can also cause pain, numbness, and tingling while walking and they can also reduce blood supply and lead to numbness.
