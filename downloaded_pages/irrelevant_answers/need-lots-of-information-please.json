            "answer": "I can remember back to when I was diagnosed and had all of the same problems.\u00a0\u00a0I am a Type 1 so things may be a little different for you than me.\u00a0\u00a0First are you Type 2 or 1.\u00a0\u00a0I know this is a Type 2 forum but your symptoms and problems sound like those of a Type 1 diabetic.Some more specific questions would be easier to address but here is some general information.First on Diet.\u00a0\u00a0Biggest advise is just eat a normal well balanced diet.\u00a0\u00a0If you have health insurance MOST of the plans will cover going to Diabetes Education classes that are offered by dieticians.\u00a0\u00a0They go over what to eat and how much to eat and specific concerns of diabetics (like carb counting).\u00a0\u00a0This is a GREAT idea you usually get a very nice book to refer back to later that covers it all.Collapsing.\u00a0\u00a0Usually these symptoms are caused by Blood Sugar that is too LOW.\u00a0\u00a0This is what makes me think you are more Type 1 in your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if a Type 2 can get these same symptoms from something else.\u00a0\u00a0If you can I would test when you are feeling this way and you will gain a better understanding of it.\u00a0\u00a0If you are low eat sugar, carbs or Glucose tablets.May be a basic miscommunication problem here as well Type 1 Diabetes (also called Juvenile Diabetes) is when your pancreas do not produce ANY insulin and can be gotten at any age either Adult or Child but it is usually gotten at an early age thus called Juvenile Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Type 2 is when your body does not use the insulin that it produces as effectively as it should so you can make adjustments in diet and exercise to compensate for those deficiencies.Exercise.\u00a0\u00a0First all exercise is good.\u00a0\u00a0It is just that diabetics must take into account that it uses carbs and sugar and other stored energy in the body.\u00a0\u00a0If you have other helth issues consult a Dr. first.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise can have differing effects on different people.\u00a0\u00a0You need to find out how it effects you in particular.\u00a0\u00a0Some people must take sugar before they exercise to maintain energy.\u00a0\u00a0Some will have their sugar levels rise during exercise and must compensate with medication.\u00a0\u00a0Adrenaline increases with exercise and the release of Adrenaline increase the the effectiveness of Insulin (whether natural or injected) in the body\u00a0\u00a0so more the same insulin will do more work when Adrenaline is increased.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore if you are a Type 2 and you exercise it will keep you sugars at a much better level.\u00a0\u00a0If you a Type 1 you need to know when you took your last Insulin as to not make that Insulin work too hard and give you Hypoglycemia ( Low Blood Sugar).\u00a0\u00a0If this is the case it can be very serious very fast.\u00a0\u00a0When execising you need to have sugar available at all times in case you need it.Vision Problems.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to assume that your vision is getting blurry every once and a while.\u00a0\u00a0If that is not the case you need to tell me what vision problems you are having.\u00a0\u00a0Temporary blurring will happen more often when diagnosed and will more that likely dimish over time.\u00a0\u00a0When your cells absorb and release Sugar they swell and shrink.\u00a0\u00a0This includes the cells in your eyes.\u00a0\u00a0This causes vision changes.\u00a0\u00a0As sugar levels stabilize the problem will subside.\u00a0\u00a0As a diabetic it is very important to see an eye Dr. once a year and for that Dr. to know that you are diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0There are some extra tests that they must do to determine if the diabetes is effecting your eyes in a permanent or temporary manner.\u00a0\u00a0If temporary they can correct it temporarily and change prescription back later as problem goes away.Glucose tablets.\u00a0\u00a0These are used to raise you sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Usually they are only needed by a Type 1 diabetic as far as I know but perhaps a Type 2 needs them as well for something.\u00a0\u00a0Don't really know what else to say about them other than take them when sugar is low and if not low dont take them.\u00a0\u00a0Just a form of sugar that can be used instead of food that is all.I know that this can be VERY confusing and VERY overwhelming.\u00a0\u00a0Not to worry it gets easier as it has time to sink in and you deal with it every day.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that this post helps you some and if you have additional questions please post them and we will do our best to answer.Good Luck:)\u00a0\u00a0We are wall pulling for you and have been there.Kevin",

            "answer": "If you're Type 2, the BEST resource out there is a book:\"The First Year Type 2 Diabetes: An Essential Guide for the Newly Diagnosed\" by Gretchen Becker.It covers everything in an easy to understand way.\u00a0\u00a0You can find it at most bookstores, and probably pretty cheap on the 'used book' web sites like half.com",
