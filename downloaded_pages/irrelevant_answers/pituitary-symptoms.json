            "answer": "Hyperhidrosis may be congenital or an acquired trait. Congenital means you are born with it, while an acquired trait means you are not; the condition is acquired later in life after birth.Hyperhidrosis may be categorized as being the result of an underlying health condition, or with no apparent cause:Primary idiopathic hyperhidrosis - there is no apparent cause. Idiopathic means \"of unknown cause\". In the majority of cases the hyperhidrosis is localized.Secondary hyperhidrosis - the person sweats too much because of an underlying health condition, such as obesity, gout, menopause, a tumor, mercury poisoning, diabetes mellitus, or hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid gland). It can also be caused by some medications. Generalized hyperhidrosis is more common among patients with secondary hyperhidrosis.According to the National Health Service (NHS), UK, approximately 3% of England's population (1.53 million people) is affected by hyperhidrosis. According to the International Hyperhidrosis Society 3% of the world's population is affected.For some people hyperhidrosis symptoms are so severe that it becomes embarrassing, causing discomfort and anxiety. The International Hyperhidrosis Society describes the consequences of hyperhidrosis as sometimes even disabling. The patient's career choices, free time activities, personal relationships, self-image and emotional well-being may be affected.Fortunately, there are several options which can treat symptoms effectively. In severe cases surgery may effectively stop the excessive sweating. The National Health Service (NHS), UK, mentions that the biggest challenge in treating hyperhidrosis is the significant number of people who do not seek medical advice, either due to embarrassment or possibly because they do not know that effective treatment exists.",
