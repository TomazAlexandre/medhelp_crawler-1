            "answer": "Did your doctor give you any meds to help with your PCOS? I don't think the Depo actually caused the PCOS. It was the weight that you put on from the side effects of the Depo shot. The acutally shot did not cause you to have PCOS. I too have PCOS. I take Metformin 500mg 2x. I also lost just over 50lbs in a year. I would have liked it to be more, but family issues have caused emotional eating. I was always on birth control (yasmin) for 2 years. I stopped taking them in August and had a normal flow 8/30-8/31. Currently I am waiting for my next cycle to start. I'm not sure if I ovulate now, but I have some supscion that I did atleast in August. If your overweight, I suggest a simple diet. Try eating 5 small meals a day which include 3 meals and 2-3 snacks depending on your day. Keep them atleast 3 hours apart. Fiber does wonders for me. If I eat Fiber enriched breakfast, I stay full until lunch at 1pm. I strongly advise if your not on Metformin, to ask your doctor if you can go on it. It realy does help.",

            "answer": "I am in a similar situation. I am 19 years old and I just found out that I have PCOS. It's crazy, and I feel like I have been betrayed by my body. I too am scared I won't be able to conceive and my Fiance, though he's handling it will, it upset as well. My doctor told me that I'm at a high risk of diabetes and need to lose at least 10% of my body weight to help with the symptoms. Perhaps exercise will help with the nausea . I'm sorry I cannot offer advice or help but I thought you should know that you are not alone.bearr",
