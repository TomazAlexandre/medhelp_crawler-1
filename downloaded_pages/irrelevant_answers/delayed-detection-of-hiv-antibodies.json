            "answer": "OP..you are confusing autoimmune diseases and immunosuppression (being immunocompromised). The latter is where there is a theoretical possibility of delayed seroconversion.\u00a0\u00a0That would include people on chemo, people with advanced, terminal cancers, people taking anti-rejection meds after an organ transplant, heavy IV drug users.It's where a person's immune system is actually compromised, and not working properly.Incidentally, the idea that even these conditions cause a delay in production of antibodies is highly debated.\u00a0\u00a0Even people with immunosuppression still test POS within the 3 month window period most times.",
