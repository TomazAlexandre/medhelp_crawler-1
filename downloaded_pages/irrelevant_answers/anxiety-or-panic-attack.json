            "answer": "Sounds like you have anxiety and you were having a panic attack. It is always good to go to the doctor though and make sure there is nothing else wrong. I had quite a few panic attacks in the begining now I kind of know how to control them but sometimes I get that fear in my head that i'm going to die and it sends me into a panic that I can't control and I just have to wait for my body to calm down. As for all the symptoms you mentioned I have had them all and I know there no fun. Good Luck and keep in touch let us know how you are doing or if you have any questions.",

            "answer": "I'll second what caveman said about this being an anxiety attack. The symptoms are all pretty classic. You seem to have a good handle on what to do when one of them \"hits\" you.........it sounds like you remain fairly calm, which is great if you can do that! Not being a doctor, I can't say if these symptoms have any possible relation to diabetes or not, which is why I also agree that seeing your doctor to rule out anything organic is a very good idea. You and your doctor can discuss the possibility of anxiety at that time and decide on a treatment plan.I wish you the best and let us know how you're doing, OK?PeaceGreenlydia",

    "question": "I have had a few of these \"attacks\".They start by a lightheaded feeling...kind of dizzy( but not bad)heart feels like its racing...fear of this being\"it\"..worry(severe)a crampy feeling..shaky(severvei think)....and a tightness near my heart..never a pain just tight.These last for a few minutes mostly(one or two were about an hour)I usually do deep breathing and drink water or pop(have diabetes in family and was wondering could it be this instead?)lay down and try to calm down.Most of the things I have checked have'nt said much about a heart squeezing.Today I had one and when I was calming down,I tried to write my symptoms down.Writing was shaky and I kinda had some trouble making the letters I wanted.That lasted only a few seconds...maybe a minute.Any information would be appreciated.",
