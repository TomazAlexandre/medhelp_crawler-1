            "answer": "Hi,I am sorry for the late response. They will be doing a stress test so they may suspect that this may be a factor in her diagnosis. Panic attacks have been known to cause pain in this area also.She may need to have more test to find the actual problem.It does seem as if she has some good doctors so that is great that they are looking to find the problem and not just sweeping it under the rug so to speak.Please let us know how her test goes.Ask her to join our community. Support is very important and she is lucky to have such a kind and caring friend looking out for her:)",
