I know i shouldnt but i feel like alls i do is yell at him constantly and complain but its like he doesnt understand how tired i am! Im so sore and still working 6 days a week come home cook and clean and chase around our one yr old and he thinks after all that i wanna have sex. Alls i want is a hot shower my feet and back rubbed. Is that to much to ask?! Today i finally broke down and cried and im so worried i wont be able to handle two babies and i just feel depressed from thinking that. Iv got so many emotions goin on i feel like im ready to have a break down :( ughhh nov 5th will you ever get here.",
