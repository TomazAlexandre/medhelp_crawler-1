            "answer": "I was a young female of 15 when I was diagnosed. I am 25 now and have been through high school finals, boyfriends, a marriage, a divorce, and now, yes, college as well. Has you daughter been in to see an Endocrinologist? This is a metabolic/Diabetic specialist.The reason I ask is because it's not only hard to be a teenage female turning into a young woman with hormone changes, but you add diabetes to that and it's damn near impossible to maintain numbers!! Stress, depression, and Diabetes all go together. Your daughter is obviously feeling overwhelmed. I don't think the Lantus is solely to blame. Women go through a chemical change every 5 years! I have been through so many insulin changes and shot regimens, I have lost count!I am finally on a pump and very happy and rarely have a number out of line...unless I have my period (normal to see a fluctuation in blood sugars), an illness (again, it's normal to have a higher readings when your ill because your body is under duress), or get upset. When I'm angry, my sugar goes down. When i'm sad, it goes up. If I cry for a bit, that will make my sugar go down because it takes energy to cry. If my adrenaline pumps through my veins, my sugar plumets because adrenaline is a hormone and so is insulin.I would highly recommend that your daughter see a female Endocrinologist. The reason is that a few female diabetics end up with a secondary metabolic disorder just due to the fact that they are diabetic.Just to let you know, it takes a lot of energy to walk, move, stand, carry a bag...all things women do when they shop. I only last about 30 minutes in a mall. It just takes too much out of me. And I always need at least 2 bottles of water that I carry in my purse. Shopping is a lot of work! Even if I am excited to be shopping.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your feedback.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, my daughter visits her endocrinologist 3 to 4 times per year.\u00a0\u00a0She also works out every day, eats well and is normally filled with energy.\u00a0\u00a0The change since she has been on Lantus has been fairly drastic. While just a few months ago she was vibrant, very social and filled with energy, she is now sleeping almost 12 hours per day and spends a good portion of her day just laying in her bed.\u00a0\u00a0She's very frustrated as she's home from school for the holidays and wants to spend more time with her high school friends and do things, but just doesn't have the energy. It pretty much took an act of God the other day to get her up to go and see a movie!And for the record, when I say that stress used to impact her greatly, I wasn't kidding.\u00a0\u00a0I used to dread any time she had a fight with the boyfriend because I knew I would be calling the ambulance in the next 12 hours.\u00a0\u00a0She's had post-boyfriend fight sugars go as low as 10 to 15.\u00a0\u00a0Final exams?\u00a0\u00a0She almost certainly would wind up semi-conscious on the floor midway through the exam.",

            "answer": "You mentioned that her sugars are running significantly higher, but her doctor lowered her Lantus? Why was that? I would think it should either be raised (little by little) or a short acting insulin, such as Humalog, be added at meal times, on a sliding scale, to cover the mealtime highs. That's how I've been treating mine for 5 of my last 38 years of being Type 1. (I'm almost 41). It's worked quite nicely. Like sickandtired1983, I have had to periodically have my dosage changed by my Endo. We just change ever some-odd period of years. For me, it's about 7 years between changes.Also, has she had a thyroid exam by her Endo? Mine just requested one fir the first time last visit, as there were recent thyroid issues with my Mom, but thyroid issues can also change the metabolism.Good luck, and let us know how you both do. Let me know if you have any questions - I've been through (almost) it all!",

    "question": "Okay, my juvenile is no longer a juvenile.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed at age 11 and is now 21.\u00a0\u00a0She had been taking Humalog/Humalin (sp?) for years.\u00a0\u00a0As she progressed into her teens, we found that stress was a BIG factor for her.\u00a0\u00a0Finals?\u00a0\u00a0She'd be unconscious.\u00a0\u00a0Fights with the boyfriend?\u00a0\u00a0Ambulance.Basically, we spent more time fighting low blood sugars (regardless of the dosage changes) than high blood sugar.As she's gotten older, her blood sugars started running a bit higher for a few months.\u00a0\u00a0Her doctor switched her to Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0Her numbers are now regularly running 200 to 300+, where they previously -- and for 10 years -- were running at 50 to 100.\u00a0\u00a0She's barely eating, exercising, doing everything right, eating perfect foods.\u00a0\u00a0She's also cut back on dosage several times on doctor's orders.She's now about 2 to 3 months on Lantus, and now that I've spent time with her over the holidays (she's at college out of state), I see major problems.\u00a0\u00a0She has NO ENERGY at all.\u00a0\u00a0It's hard for her to get the energy up to even see her friends.\u00a0\u00a0For all of the parents of teens out there, we were shopping today and the pants she's wanted at Abercrombie were on sale and she didn't have the energy to wait while I stood in line.Does anyone else out there have experience with Lantus???????",
