            "answer": "Thanks guys! Yeah I've been drinking a lot lately. I'm drinking up to 4-5 liters of water a day. Im drinking that much now so I can flush out my system in case of in infection. Today I've only gone to the bathroom about 7-8 times. Not sure if that is normal or not, but yeah I always have the attacks after I look at symptoms. You'd think I'd know better but it's gotten me obsessed with it. First I thought I had cancer..then I got over that..then I thought I had a thyroid problem..then I got over that. Then I thought acid reflux, and then I got over that..and now diabetes. LOL it's pathetic! I really need to stop.Also, when you guys have an attack how much does your heart rate go up? Mine really pounds!",

            "answer": "Yeah your heart will pound so hard and fast you can almost see it pounding in you chest. it is def. the computer that is causing the panic attacks. looking up all that stuff and just the simple act of staring at the computer screen for long periods will bring them on. I know this first hand. I went through all the same things you did. Something to think about is the fact that most people that find out they have cancer or some other serious illness almost never really have bad symptoms first. They go to the doc for something else and thats when the discover the cancer. You are only 20 and have a long healthy life ahead of you. just relax and enjoy it. Chances are by the time you are old enough to catch cancer they will have a cure. Oh yeah and for drinking a lot of water to rid of an infection that really won't do any good especially cause you probably don't have one its just in your head. Just tell yourself you are going to run your life not let the panic and anxiety run it. Good Luck!!",

    "question": "hey everyone. how's it going?so lately for the past month or so I've been anxiety free. my heart use to constantly race everyday and for a solid month it was in the 80's-90's at the most which was a complete relief to me.recently i've been urinating a lot and well for the past couple days i've been looking up symptoms and of course one was diabetes. I of course got scared as hell and from then on have been obsessed with looking up diabetes, causes, effects..etc. here's the thing though I'm 20 years old, skinny, pretty active, and it does not run in my family at all. I've been to the doctors 3 times in November and December *physician in which she took blood tests* and my cardilogist who ran about every test on me. Well today I again was looking at symptoms and such when I began to feel my heart race really fast. I'm talking 120-130ish. It really scared me so I got off the computer, and then I began to shake, feel weak, mouth dry, and sweaty palms. I then sat down, calmed myself, and within 15 minutes my heart rate went way down and is going back to normal.my question is could all this nonsense with me looking up symptoms, and being obsessed with checking out all these meds sites and scaring myself be the cause of why I had an attack? EACH AND EVERY time I've ever had an attack it started in my room, and would be right after or during when I was on the computer.answers would be greatly appreciated.thanks. :)",
