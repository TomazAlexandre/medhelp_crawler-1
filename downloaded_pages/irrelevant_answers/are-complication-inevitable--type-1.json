            "answer": "Hello imtko,I am one of the volunteers here, so, please remember that I am NOT a medical professional, but a mother of an 11 year old who was diagnosed with type 1 at age 3.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, my sister was dxd 10 years ago at age 24.Your A1C's are great. Although you could still be in what they call the honeymoon phase where you body still produces a little insulin giving you better BG's at times, just continue to take care of yourself.My son has been living with diabetes for 8 years and my sister has for 10 and neither of them have complications FROM diabetes.Do not give up on your life because you have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Taking care of yourself in a different way (than before) is part of your life now.\u00a0\u00a0Just continue to do it and see your endocrinologist when you are supposed to see him or her and seek advice from him / her when you do see a pattern of highs / lows.Do not rule out marriage.\u00a0\u00a0If you meet someone who cares about you, he or she (you did not mention if you were male or female, sorry:) should want to learn about diabetes so that he/she can be supportive.\u00a0\u00a0This is NOT a death sentence.\u00a0\u00a0If I thought it was, do you think I, as a mother of a sweet 11 yr. old would be sitting here typing to anyone and keeping a positive attitude?I am not trying to make you feel bad, but you still have SO MUCH LIFE AHEAD of YOU!\u00a0\u00a0You CAN LIVE, not just exist....but, you need to remember that in order to stay healthy.....in order to greatly reduce the risk of problems / complications, you need to be active (like you are now) in caring for your diabetes.Also, if you are a female, there have been MANY women who have type 1 who have successful pregnancies.\u00a0\u00a0Of course the proper medical (prenatal) care is necessary and a type 1 would be high risk and see a perianatologist, in addition to support and advice from your endo., but there are many succes stories.Do not worry about passing diabetes onto your child.\u00a0\u00a0I am unsrue what the percetnage is to be honest with you.Sure, if I could, I would take my son's diabetes from him, but he is living and healthy and a wonderful, compassionate, boy.\u00a0\u00a0We do things a bit differently than we would as far as him staying the night at a friend's house.\u00a0\u00a0I am not ready for that yet.\u00a0\u00a0He can stay the night at my mom's house because she knows what to do if he needs someone to help him.If you keep taking care of yourself and seek help when necessary, you have a future.\u00a0\u00a0There can be a happy future for you.\u00a0\u00a0No one can promise anyone that they will not have a certain health problem, even if that person is not a diabetic, but since you are, my son is, and over 16 million americans are, there is hope and proof right on this board that people get married and have bright futures.Diabetes is unpredicatable and there will be unexplainable highs....that IS what THIS disease looks like.\u00a0\u00a0You can only do your best to make sure you have the knowledge and the tools to take care of yourself.You care enough about YOU to post here, so I think you will continue to care.Possibly share some of your feelings with a social worker.\u00a0\u00a0It helps to talk.At times, a lot of people feel doom and gloom, but you can live and look to the future with hope:)Take care,SS",

            "answer": "There are lots of old-time Type 1 diabetics around who don't have any serious complications. Like you, I became T1 at 21. That was 28 years ago. Since then, I have got married, had two children, had a career, emigrated to New Zealand, started my own business etc. And I still dont have any serious complications.Minimal retinopathy weas picked up in a recent eye examination. But it doesn't affect my vision. And I am determined to clear it up by improved control. So stop worrying. If you can keep your HBA1Cs below 6.5% and maintain a healthy lifestyle, you shouldn't have any problems, at all.Cheers,Mark",

            "answer": "You see, you are already receiving great input from people who are also living with type 1.\u00a0\u00a0My sister was dxd at age 24 ten years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I forgot to mention that in my answer.\u00a0\u00a0I only mentioned my son.The reason I want to mention my sis is because she had a lot of IGNORANT people say stupid things about her life expectancy, etc.\u00a0\u00a0People who say those things are ignorant.\u00a0\u00a0Just keep taking care of yourself and make sure you see your endocrinologist every 3 months (unless otherwise specified by your doc).No one here is saying that you will not have bad days, but you CAN have a future and it can be a healthy one.\u00a0\u00a0I truly believe that.",

            "answer": "Hey,I have had type 1 diabetes for 15 years and I am 27.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you may need to talk to someone professional and sort out some feelings.\u00a0\u00a0You can live a long wonderful life if you make it your priority.\u00a0\u00a0No one else can do it for you.\u00a0\u00a0Your A1C scores are good and that is key.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is tricky and sometimes your body does not do what you think it should, or what your doc thinks it should.\u00a0\u00a0My advice is to find a great doc who can listen and also tell you what needs to be done.\u00a0\u00a0I know there are people in the med field who talk like you are lucky to make it to that evenings dinner.\u00a0\u00a0Do not listen.\u00a0\u00a0When I was diagnosed at age 12 the diabetes \"educator\" at the hospital told me I would probably not live to be 35.\u00a0\u00a0BULL ****!\u00a0\u00a0I get angry just thinking about that. I am married, have the most gorgeous daughter and plan on being on this planet for a good 75 more years at least:-)\u00a0\u00a0Remember, none of us are promised another tomorrow so grab life by the horns and enjoy the ride!",

            "answer": "I am a grandmother who was diagnose 38 years ago as a 12-year-old. I have no complications of any sort. So no, it is NOT true that all diabetics suffer from complications. The key is to keep your glucose levels in the normal range as much as is possible. With today's insulins and pumps, it is easier than ever before to keep a comfortable a1c level in the low 6's without suffering dangerous hypoglycemic episodes. Yes, you have to test often and adjust either food intake or medication, depending on what the results are.Since you are asking for information on help with the cost of supplies, let me direct you to our Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST). Please follow the directions in the answer to \"vader 418\", who posted a question above this one and when you fill out the form, write that you need help with the cost of diabetic supplies. You will be put in touch with the staff member who handles all requests of this nature and who has a wealth of knowledge about what is available in various states for diabetic people who have no insurance.May you live long and healthily.",

            "answer": "Thanks a lot for all your support. But sometimes its just crazy you know, reading all those numbers online, where this % get this, this %get that, and those %ages are very high. Taking care of myself is what i will continue to do, but its the hope that not in me yet. Of course there are many healthy type 1, but there are more of the non helthy with complications, those of you who know, i just wonder, what is the life expectancy for type ones at 21 if A1c is around 7 or so ? Just wonderingThanks for all your input, and i truly do believe you and will keep those numbers under 7 no matter what. Nowadays, im in Lantus, 4 shots a day, and check levels about 6 times a day, and i will continue to do so. The hardest part now, is exercising, i used to exercise 6 days a week, serious exercise, but now im afraid to go hypo !Any suggestionsThanks again, i hope all of you and your loved ones live the day to say \"Look at me, 85 years old and in perfect health :)\"",

I was diagnosed at 14 I am now 43 no complications married, divorced, remarried have a beautiful daughter who is healthy and strong and my A1C's run about 5.9!It takes hard work and a strong will to stay in control but I think it has made me a stronger person. You have all the right stuff!!! My life is good and honestly I would not change a thing.I wish you all the happiness you will get it!One thing that may make your life a little easier is an insulin pump. It gives me more freedom to run my life on my schedule. Check with your insurance it does require pre-approval most of the time.All the bestCarolyn",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed T1 29 years ago at the age of 25. I am free of complications. My A1Cs have been running at about 7.0 for years with MDI. I am now trying out a pump to determine whether I can improve my control.I have been happily married for 30 years. We only had one child because I feared, as you probably do, that my children would be diabetic, and we felt that we could take care of only one diabetic child. My son, who is about your age, is completely healthy and not diabetic.Raising a child is one of the most important things a person can do in life. If you rob yourself of the opportunity you will miss out on a huge part of life.\u00a0\u00a0My only regret is not having more children (my son also wishes that he had brothers or sisters).I've gotten a PhD and had a productive, satisfying career.\u00a0\u00a0I earned a Black Belt in Karate.\u00a0\u00a0I did all of this 10 years after I became diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0You can do almost anything you set your mind to.I sincerely believe that a cure will be found in your lifetime.\u00a0\u00a0Live it as if you believe it, too.",

    "question": "Hello. Im a type 1 for alomst a year now, and have been on Insulin. My A1C is about 6.5 all the time. sometime up to 6.7 or 6.8\u00a0\u00a0My question is, being diagnosed at 21, when should i start expecting compliactions to kick in ? Im not scared, and know that sooner than later my life will become nothing more than a burned tree. I just want to know when to expect it. I dont want to get married and do anything that has a future, because feel that it will all be a waste at the end. If i have children, they will end up being diabetics, and if i become all brittle and \"complicated\" then i will be a huge burden on many, and i definately do not want this to happen. When will this happen ? Please be honest. Thakns for your reply !",
