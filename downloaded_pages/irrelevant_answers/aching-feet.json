            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Aching feet can be due to wrong foot wear. So check that out. It can be a peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes or hypothyroidism.Pain or soreness in the foot, that eases with time during the day, is generally indicative of plantar fasciitis. The first step you take generally after sitting or standing for a long time or when you get up from the bed is painful. As you start walking the pain clears up. Plantar fascia is a ligament that connects your heel bone to your toes. If it swells, becomes weak or inflamed, it causes these symptoms. After some time, you may feel pain always. The other possibility is osteoarthritis. This also causes pain worse after inactivity\u2014the first few steps always painful.\u00a0\u00a0Please consult an orthopedic specialist regarding this.If possible consult a sports injury center. This is equipped with treatment options for plantar fasciitis. There are various things you can try such as especially designed insoles, night splints and wraps. Besides this there are various massage therapies, stretch exercises, and pressure point stimulation by trained specialists.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
