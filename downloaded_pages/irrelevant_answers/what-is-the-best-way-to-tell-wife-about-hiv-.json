            "answer": "I guess the simple answer to that, is that there is no good way to tell someone. It's going to bring up a lot of questions for your wife, infidelity, IV drug use, homosexual activity, just to name a few. In my opinion, taking her to the Dr's with you could help with \"the technicality of HIV\", but it will be up to you to do the rest.Have you had any testing done yet? Do you know how your health is in relation to HIV?I want to wish you luck in this journey, and pray that your wife is not infected. Good luck to you both, and keep us posted.~Sue",

            "answer": "I'm sorry you were not able to tell your wife yourself, that would probably have been better for both of you.I want you to know that there's hope! I was diagnosed HIV positive in October of 1989. At that point, I really didn't know what it was. I thought it was a death sentence, and so did most of the Dr's. I was sure I wouldn't live past 30.We've come a long way since then! With the new medications, it is no longer a death sentence, but a manageable disease, like diabetes. Of course you have to educate yourself, so you can take part in your medical decisions as well as knowing the risks to others (not nearly as many as some think).Make sure your wife gets tested, earlier diagnoses, earlier treatment = more success. Just know that there are many good treatment options out there, find a good Dr, and TRY to keep your spirits up. I know that it's hard.~Sue",
