            "answer": "Hi all! I too have had these problems for a year and a half. In the summer of 07 I had a yeast infection for four months that would not go away, and never even cultured. Tried everything, diflucan, boric acid, monistat, terazol. What finally killed it was gynazole. Was clear for 11 months. Now have another, I am not sure what triggered it. Took a gynazole, felt better for 10 days, then it came back. And the funny thing is my yeast they cannot see under a microscope and it does not culture. Anyone ever heard of this?Also I have found that garlic cloves help with the burning!",
