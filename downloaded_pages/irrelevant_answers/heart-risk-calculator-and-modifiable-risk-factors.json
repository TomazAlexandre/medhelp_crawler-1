I see the beginnings of a crease in my left earlobe in pictures of me as a teenager. I'm now 60 and no sign of heart disease but well developed creases in each earlobe. I have personally known people with unlined and plump healthy looking earlobes who have departed this earth early--like early 50's--from a heart attack. So I don't worry a bit about it.",
