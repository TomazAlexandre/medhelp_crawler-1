            "answer": "Hi Ultrasounds are notoriously inaccurate for estimating baby size, particularly later in the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a05 days out is nothing.\u00a0\u00a0Recommend you don't worry....\u00a0\u00a0Also there is a lot of normal variation in growth as the pregnancy progresses.My last ultrasound they told me my baby is too big (33 wks vs the actual 30 weks) and now I am getting hell from my doctors about weight gain, diabetes control (I have GD, but it is pretty well controlled) etc.\u00a0\u00a0But I had a midwife tell me my baby is small based on her palpatations.\u00a0\u00a0Don't know who to believe but have decided not to worry either way.",

            "answer": "Obviously sweetheart, not all babies are born weighing the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0So it would be understandable that every baby grows differently.\u00a0\u00a0Being smaller certainly doesn't make the baby inferior.\u00a0\u00a0It just means that the baby is smaller than average....according to the doctorsI have to agree with Sally on this one.\u00a0\u00a0I do not think that their methods of measuring size and weight are accurate at this stage in pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0So I say, please do not worry.\u00a0\u00a0You little precious one will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0I just feel it....Please don't worry.All the best,Heather",

So she's goin to be long legged and tall like her mommy...Dr. said. I wouldn't worry if measurments are slightly off or behind. I think they catch up in the end anyway.",

The ultra sound I had today revealed the baby was measuring at about 27 weeks and 2 days.\u00a0\u00a0The dr. said her measurements were all a little small, in the 22nd percentile, where they would consider normal at 50 %.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else had this problem?
