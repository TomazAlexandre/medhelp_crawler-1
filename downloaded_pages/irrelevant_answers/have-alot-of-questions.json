            "answer": "eLori, thank you for posing your questions to our Forum.\u00a0\u00a0You raise many important concerns that require answers of medical professionals who can see all aspects of your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 Steroids can create abnormalities of metabolism (including high blood sugar), but without knowing all relevant information, that is not something I can determine.\u00a0\u00a0My suggestion is to find a doctor(s) you can put your faith and trust in and pose your questions to them.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best.",
