            "answer": "Wow.. you are such a caring friend to be here for your friend... yes you are correct the point of methodone WAS to help you get off opiates... however our system has started to \"maintain\" people on it... The docs figure that legal \"liquid handcuffs\" is better than the person out using... Its wrong but totally legal..Yes it is probably slowly killing her... She needs inpatient detox and treatment.. With all the meds she is on I would think her attempting to stop cold turkey could be dangerous.. and that is a very high dose of methodone..However until she wants to quit and make the change it will be hard for her to do so...",

            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I am also on Methadone but just a 10 mg three times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Even at that dose though, if I were to stop taking it, the withdrawal would make me want to kill myself.\u00a0\u00a0I think you friend is definitely taking a higher dose than she probably has to.\u00a0\u00a0I would give anything if I had not started on Methadone, I was on Lorcet prior to that (the same thing as Lortab) and also Oxycontin which is another drug from the devil.\u00a0\u00a0Your friend definitely needs to get off the Methadone but it will be very hard and I imagine in her case inpatient rehab would be the best route to take, or if she might want to consider Suboxone, that is what I am thinking of doing, I don't think it would be quite as bad in regards to trading on addiction for another which is the case for Methadone.\u00a0\u00a0She is very lucky to have you for a friend, I cannot say that any of my friends would be concerned enough to write in for help like you have.\u00a0\u00a0Just do what you can to convince her to get off the Methadone.Love, Cindy",

            "answer": "In my experiences, methadone is at least, if not more, addictive than vicodins plus the withdrawals seem much worse and more drawn out. In smaller quantities, methadone gave me tons of energy but when you're talking about taking wafers (40 mg) at a time, it will make you pass out. I actually switched to vicodin just to help with methadone withdrawals cuz I thought nothing could be worse. I was only up to about 1/2 wafer a day, so I can't imagine what would be for someone taking 8x that. There's no way one could go cold turkey, she'd have to taper for a while.",

    "question": "I have a question..I have a friend who is 33 years old. She was addicted to Lortabs and other pain meds (Lortab being the drug of choice).\u00a0\u00a0In the attempt to get her off of the Lortab, she started her methadone.\u00a0\u00a03 years later she is still taking, what seems to me a HIGH dose of methadone. (I think it's like 180 or 185mg)....She also has diabetes and unfortunately doesn't do much with her diet...her blood sugar usually stays at 250 or higher on a daily basis.On top of this she is also on many other drugs prescribed to\u00a0\u00a0her for the the other issues she has (digestion, diarrhea, neurothapy, and other complications).\u00a0\u00a0Up until this past Friday she didnt' even tell her doctor that she was on methadone, and he was giving her darvocet.\u00a0\u00a0He now knows and has adjusted her other meds in regards to the methadone she is taking.\u00a0\u00a0On many occasions she can't stay awake, Her pupils are huge, and on more than one occasion she's been so out of it we had to call 911 and the paramedics did a deep chest rub to wake her up.We're so worried about her, I personally think the methadone is slowly killing her. She was so much more with it and alert, and could function when she was on the Lortab addiction. We've watched her go downhill very quickly since being on the methadone.\u00a0\u00a0(not that her diabetes and lack of self motivation to keep her sugar in check helps any)Isn't the point of methadone that they help wean you off of your addiction. Shouldn't she be weaning off of her methadone rather than staying at such a high dose or am I wrong. If the doctors are not doing their jobs when they are prescribing the drugs then i want to pursue that as well.",
