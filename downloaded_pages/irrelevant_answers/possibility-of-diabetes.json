    "question": "I have had extreme frequent urination problems for a couple years now\u00a0\u00a0(presumed to be from ureteral endometriosis and pelvic floor dysfunction) but more recently I have felt very fatigued, and I have been SO thirsty, its really strange. I googled it because its been getting really annoying being thirsty all the time and having to pee 80 times a day, and half the stuff that came up when I searched was related to diabetes. I am 20, I am a healthy weight (5'3 112 lbs., but have lost 15 pounds this past year, somewhat unintentionally), and I'm just wondering if this is something I should worry about at all",
