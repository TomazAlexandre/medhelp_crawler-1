    "question": "Alexis Cyanne came into the world today at 12:04pm. She was delivered by a planned c-section at 37wks 3days (original due date was July 4th) due to gestational diabetes and mild pre-eclampsia. She weighed a whopping 10lbs and was 20 1/2 inches long. She is in the NICU due to low blood sugar and not wanting to eat a lot yet. Please pray for my little girl. I haven't even got to hold her yet or visit her in the NICU since I still have a morphine pump and a catheter in. But it all comes out tomorrow. I can't wait to hold my new little girl. :) I got my tubes tied today so this is our last baby.",
