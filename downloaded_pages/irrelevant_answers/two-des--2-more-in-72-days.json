            "answer": "kenkeith's comments were very good and it sounds like he knows what he is tallking about. I'll give you my history so you can hopefully make informed andlifesaving decisions in the future. I am currently 44 years old have hypertension, type 2 diabetes and I too am a little overweight and used to have high total cholesterol and low HDL.Since Jan 15th 2006 I have had 4 heart attacks(shipped out by ambulance to nearest heart hospital 160 miles away once and lifeflighted out once)I have 4 medicated and 1 unmedicated stents and all of them have recurring blockages(as much as 60%).I had a triple bypass in DEC, 2006 and my Right Coronary graft plugged up 100% within 6 months and the artery it bypassed has a 60% blockage in it.I didn't tell you all this for sympathy I just wanted to let you know that when you experience heart disease you may continue to have problems in the future and it is very important for you to keep a positive attitude and to continue with your medical care. I have experienced my share of bad medical advice and care.I don't know where you live and what kind of access you have to quality heart hospitals but I do know from experience that if you feel anything that is not right it is extremely important to get medical care. Don't ever be embarrassed by going for medical care even if it turns out that there isn't anything wrong at the time and if the doctors make you feel like you are wasting their time find a different doctor. If they have a negative attitude towards your medical problem find a different doctor. There are plenty of good doctors out there and you don't need to waste your time on the crappy doctors.I hope this helped you and if you ever would like to talk or need a little moral support feel free to contact me at ***@****",
