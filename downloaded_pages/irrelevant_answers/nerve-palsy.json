Usually things would start to improve in a 2-3 months.\u00a0\u00a0I still am not clear as to exacly why you developed the bilateral 6th nerve palsy in the first place,\u00a0\u00a0Not knowing all your details I would have to direct you to a neuro-ophthalmologist.\u00a0\u00a0In general, if the problem is due to a systemic disease problem, it will often get better as the disease gets better (eg improved diabetes control, improved pseudotumor cerebri, improved intrracranial pressure, improved hypertension.)\u00a0\u00a0In your case, I'm not sure what is actually going on.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you well, see a neuro-ophthalmologist.",
