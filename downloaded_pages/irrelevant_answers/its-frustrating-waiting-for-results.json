            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. As is clear from MRI the brain lesions could be caused by a number of conditions. The only way to differentiate is through blood tests which your doctor has gone ahead with. By now all test results should be available. In a way\u2014no news is good news, but please call your doctor\u2019s office and confirm.If you do not have MS, Lyme, lupus, diabetes, hypertension etc, then the brain lesions are due to old injury. MS diagnosis will also need a spinal tap.If old brain injury is the cause of your symptoms, then there is noting much you can do but improve your memory through specially designed games.Balance issues could also be due to pinched nerves in neck or due o ear problems. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your quick reply. I did call the doctor again yesterday and finally got my results. Everything was fine, except for my thyroid levels were very low .20. I am already on levothyroxine and have been since last year when nodules were found in my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0A biopsy was done and was inconclusive, so doctor just put me on the med.I have made an appt to see the Neurologist again, he is an excellent doctor, but unfortunately he is very busy and I am not able to see him until November.He did suggest a spinal tap if the blood tests were negative, so I am wondering if the low thyroid would have anything to do with the white matter changes, or if these are two totally different issues. I really don't want to go through a spinal tap if the thyroid is the cause.Thank you so much for your advice!",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 43 year old woman with chronic pain as a result of a auto accident 5 years ago. Since that time, I have had 3 cervical fusions, but still suffer pain and headaches, poor memory, some confusion, and I have difficulty with balance. My doctor scheduled a brain scan and I finally got these results 2 months later:FINDINGS: There are a few scattered focal areas of abnormal T2 signal hyperintensity in the deep and subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres bilaterally that are nonspecific with an extensive differential including: Sequela of migraine headaches, sequela of previous trauma, demyelinating disease (ADEM, MS), infection (Lyme disease), and chronic small vessel ischemic disease (found in patients with long-standing hypertension and/or diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0Gray-white differentiation of the brain is otherwise within normal limits. The neurologist ordered lab tests and it has been two weeks now and still no results.\u00a0\u00a0Can you help me figure out what this means?",
