    "question": "Lately I have been plagued by seeing stars.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes when I gag or cough, or I have seen them while crouching down or laying back in a pool.\u00a0\u00a0It's really starting to bother me.\u00a0\u00a0I have brought it up to my primary and she told me not to worry and I have also had a full eye exam from an opthamologist.\u00a0\u00a0There are also times where I see floaters in my vision especially while at work (lots of computer screens and fluorescent lighting).My other main concern is that my vision changes throughout the day, I see much clearer than I do later in the day (it always happens but some days are worse than others)A little background:\u00a0\u00a0I am 24 years old have type 2 diabetes, I have also had 2 MRI's and MRA's over the past 2 years (both normal).\u00a0\u00a0Everytime any of my doctor's listens to my heart they say it sounds normal and my blood pressure is always normal during my visits.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested every year for thyroid problems and my tests have always came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0My liver enzymes have been high the past year, but my doctors think that it is because I have fatty liver (came up on an ultrasound and a ct)I look forward to hearing your opinion!Thanks!",
