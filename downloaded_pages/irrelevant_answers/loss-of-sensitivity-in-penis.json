    "question": "Hi,I'm 26 and a few years ago I got sick and my kidney's started shutting down. My creatinine level was very elevated and there was protein in my urine, causing my doctor to tell me that they were working at only 30%. The doctors could not figure out why this happened and I was able to recover after a couple of months, though I still do have elevated creatinine. At the same time, I began seeing this girl and noticed that I had a lack of sensitivity in my penis.\u00a0\u00a0Before this all happened, I was extremely sensitive, had a very large sex drive, and could have sex quite a few times during a night with no problem. When I have sex, oral sex, or even when I masturbate now, my penis has lost most of its sensitivity, even to the point that sometimes I cannot feel anything, especially when trying to have sex a second time.\u00a0\u00a0It has really crushed my sex drive and usually during sex I end up focusing on how it doesn't feel like it used to, which all ends up making it quite difficult to finish, if at all. Additionally, it seems like my penis doesn't get as hard as it did prior to me getting sick, though it is not that extreme. My desire just does not seem to be what it was.My doctor thought that it was a psychological issue, that I was in a state of depression. I ended up being with this girl for a long time and the relationship was pretty stressful, but even after that ended and I've been happy and with other women, my sensitivity still has not returned. I'm wondering what steps I can take to try to get this diagnosed/treated. Could it be an issue with my kidneys or testosterone?I appreciate any help you can give.Thank you",
