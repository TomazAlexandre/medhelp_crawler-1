            "answer": "Hi there. There could be various causes of dizziness including low blood pressure due to anemia, bleeding and dehydration, heat cramps, exhaustion, high blood pressure, cardiomyopathies, conduction discturbances,diabetes both hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia, endocrinal disorders like hyper and hypothyroidism, addison\u2019s disease, vasovagal syncope, etc. since you had back issues, you need to be evaluated for a disc herniation at the cervical or thoracic spine level. MRI spine would better evaluate the degenerative disc disease if the culprit for these symptoms. Your doctor would need to rule out multiple sclerosis, a chronic demyelinating disorder for these symptoms. Consult a neurologist for more clarification. Hope this helps. Take care.",
