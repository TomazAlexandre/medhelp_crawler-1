    "question": "Hello!Thanks to any and all helpful answers.I'm concerned because lately (past 2-3 weeks, maybe a month) I have noticed what looks to be an oily film on my urine in the toilet in the morning after urinating in the middle of the night. I've done a little looking around online and what I've seen seems to pin this on a substance called \"chyle,\" but none of the advice posted mentions whether or not this is cause for concern or should be taken to a physician.Aside from the oily film, I'm not experiencing any symptoms, and in fact feel great (I am generally fit and well hydrated). If it's relevant, my diet is based on whole foods, prepared at home, and is typically high fat/protein and low carbohydrate (only from vegetable/fruit sources of which i eat a lot).Thanks again!",
