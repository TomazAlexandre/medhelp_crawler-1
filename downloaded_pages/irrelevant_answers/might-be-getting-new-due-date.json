            "answer": "if you are 100% positive that your dates are right....DONT let them change due date too much. cause if they change your due date by 2 weeks and then take him/her 2 weeks early because of size....then the lungs are going to be 4 weeks premature....they may have to do steroid shots or a amnio before taking him/her....otherwise there may be a risk of complication. not trying to scare you....just if you KNOW your dates are right then the baby is just big or there might be alot of fluid in there.alot of it depends on YOU knowing your dates and such. talk it over in length with your doc/midwife to make sure that changing due date is a good idea. IF that is even an option. as i said i am not trying to scare you but just letting you know what could happen if dates are messed with too much even with a big baby.",
