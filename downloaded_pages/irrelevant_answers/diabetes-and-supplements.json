            "answer": "Thanks for all the input. The intent was to see if anyone out there have supplemented their control with supplements. To clarify some question that came up, I am a 47 year old Reliability Engineer and runner that was diagnosed with Type II over a year ago. I take a couple of supplements to help control the conversion of glucose to energy along with medication, diet and exercise. There have been success stories of Type II reversal with proper diet, exercise and medication to include supplements. I dont believe at all a supplement is a cure all, but there are evidense they assist in the battle primarily for Type II, but have shown good support to assist in the battle to control Type I.I hope this spins some clarity on my question and look forward to more good conversation.",
