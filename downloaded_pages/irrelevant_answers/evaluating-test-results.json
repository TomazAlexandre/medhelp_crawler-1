            "answer": "You need to talk to an Endocrinologist.Your T4 is very high.Your T3 should also be very high, but it is very low.Your TSH is high, which should mean your T4 and T3 should be low, but within lab limits.The low T3 is probably causing your Pituitary to produce more TSH to stimulate the thyroid. You have way more T4 than you need, but the low T3 means your body wants more hormones.The Thyroid produces and excretes T4, T3, and a few other hormones. The T3 is used right away, and the T4 is converted to T3 as the body needs it.If you are on thyroid meds for Hypothyroidism, you are only getting T4, unless you are taking Armour. Your body takes the T4 provided by Synthroid, for example, and converts it to T3 as it needs it.Something is going on. It sounds like you are having trouble converting T4 to T3, and may benefit by switching to Armour if you are on hormone replacement meds at this time.An Endocrinologist may be required to get to the root of the problem. If you don't have an Endocrinologist, make sure you see one that specializes in thyroid disease. Some Endos focus more on Diabetes.",
