I just hope I don't disappoint you with another relapse but for the first time I am guardedly optimistic. I had all but one of the negative predictors for beating this thing: genotype 1, male, over 45 years of age, high load (6.5 miliion IU/ML), transplant recipient and diabetic. The one neagtive predictor that I didn't have was cirrhosis so if I do get lucky and become an SVR I hope this will give some people a bit more hope. I can't express how much it means that you are rooting for me and have such nice things to say about me. I don't honestly feel that I deserve this type of regard but I'll wrap it around me and allow it to keep me warm and strong for the duration of the waiting game that we all are forced to play. Thanks again to all of you and I wish you all the very best. Be well. MikeIndiana; How is your wife doing? You may have posted and I missed it but I have been concerned and would love an update.",
