    "question": "Hi everyone,I accidently came across this forum when actually looking for another topic. I am glad this is here and that I see some familiar names from other boards I frequent. :-)I haven't been diagnosed with an adrenal disorder, but I believe it is not far off from happening.\u00a0\u00a0I have a big round of testing coming up (can't remember them all... I'll find the list and post it).In the mean time, I was hoping someone could help me control my symptoms.First my background and current diagnosises:Prolactinoma - Cabergonline .5 mg weeklyHashimotos - Levothyroxine 75 mcg dailyHigh Blood Pressure and super fast heart rate - some medication that starts with an N. :-PDepression/Anxiety - Lexapro 10 mg dailyVitamin D Definancy - 2000 iu dailyPCOS/Type 2 diabetes - MetforminI have flank pain in times of slight/severe stress (used to only be when it was severe, but now it's anytime I feel even nervous or defensive). Drastic mood changes, nausea & diarreha worst in the morning and gradually gets better through the day, night time I have the most energy, sleep disturbances, thirst, salt craving, dizziness, weight gain that won't stop!, etc.Any help or suggestions on how to make myself feel better would be great!Also could any of my diagnosises be related to each other and if so is there a treatment I could do that could really help me out tremendously instead of treating them one by one?Thank you,Sarah",
