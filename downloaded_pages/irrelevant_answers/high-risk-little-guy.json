            "answer": "Actually genetics do play a part in how baby grows - after all, family genes are coming from both mom and dad and all along my doctor has said that genetics do play a part, as did the geneticist that we spoke too, but that other things were possible too, which is why we tested for downs and all again, I was even tested for about 8 different viruses.\u00a0\u00a0As far as me, I was 8lb 8oz at birth, my husband was 5lb 9oz.And yes, diabetes can cause big babies,\u00a0\u00a0it can also cause little babies...you just don't hear about them as often as that's not quite as news worthy as a 10 pounder lol",

    "question": "I am 29w and am high risk due to diabetes and hypertension. My baby is measuring small, in the 3rd percentile. We have been tested twice for chromosomal defects and the results have been negative (1st trimester screen and blood - materni-t21). My husband and his family are all small statue (my husband is 5'3\"). Has anyone else been high risk, small baby at this stage and baby ended up being over 6 lbs at birth?",
