            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0An enlarged pituitary gland may cause headache due to pressure symptoms or raised intracranial pressure. Also, scattered foci of increased T2/Flair signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol. Though they are of no immediate threat, all these causes, and the presence of ischemic changes can be a risk factor for future stroke. Hence, prevention methods should include a healthy lifestyle, and a combination of diet, exercise, and medicines.Since you have loss of muscle mass and sensation of limbs, generalized deep vein thrombosis, atherosclerosis and peripheral neuropathies (diabetes or thyroid related or autoimmune) should be ruled out. Please discuss with your treating doctors. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Hi-Was the MRI of the brain or was it a pituitary MRI?If it was not a pituitary MRI, you should ask your doctor to refer you for a pituitary MRI.This would be to take a closer look at the gland, itself to make sure that it is healthy. Pituitary problems are common. Hormonal issues and/or a pituitary growth might need treatment. Has the doctor ordered any hormone tests for you?Take careHorselip",

    "question": "########################################################### F I N A L ##########################################################MRI BRAIN:CLINICAL HISTORY: HeadacheTECHNIQUE: Sagittal T1, axial FSE T2, axial FLAIR, axial gradient T2 and diffusion-weighted imaging through the brain.COMPARISON: None.FINDINGS:The pituitary gland is enlarged measuring 11 mm craniocaudal by 11 mm AP. No discrete mass is identified and a dedicated MRI of the pituitary gland is recommended for further characterization.In the subcortical and periventricular white matter are several foci of abnormal T2 signal. These are nonspecific but likely represent early changes of chronic small vessel ischemia. The intracranial structures are otherwise normal without mass,hemorrhage, acute ischemia or extra-axial fluid collection. The midline structures are intact and the ventricles are normal in size.The paranasal sinuses are clear. The mastoid air cells and orbits are unremarkable. Normal flow-voids are present in the major intracranial vessels and the dural sinuses are patent. The craniocervical junction is unremarkable without evidence of Chiarimalformation. Normal marrow signal is present in the calvarium.",
