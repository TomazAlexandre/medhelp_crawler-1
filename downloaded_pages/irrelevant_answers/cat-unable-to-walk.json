            "answer": "Hi I have a cat that I found Dec 24 and he was pulling himself with his front paws.I called the vet and took him there and the vet told me that it was from 3 pucture wounds from something that got ahold of him.(There was no blood or cuts on him that I seen but the xray showed this).BUT he will be fine after the steroid treatment and rest hopefully.He also eats and purrs and does'nt seem to be in pain.The vet is taking care of him but I could of brought him home but dont have the money till the 4th of jan.This is'nt my cat but I love animals and could'nt see it just dragging its self along outside like that.The vet did say something about a blood clot but that was'nt the case, so wish me luck and I also believe that if I was you I would'nt give up just yet either.Praying for your pet to have a full recovey.By the way the vet said the cat just needs to rest and stay in a area to himself till he heals and also the steroid pills for 10 days.Take care",

            "answer": "lillybob, it could be a couple if things.\u00a0\u00a0Feline diabetes has posterior weakness as a symptom.But the weight loss could suggest renal failure as well (especially if the weakness is more prevalent in one leg).It doesn't sound like stroke but spinal tumour is possible (any x rays?). Perhaps you should get a second opinion, especially if this isn't an animal hospital but a vet's office. Vet's tend to be more like the old fashion \"Horse doctors\" that treated a whole area, animals , people and all.Redut1, that's a great diagnosis. I'm assuming inflammation of some sort set in causing difficulty in using the hindquarters? Hopefully the treatment will work. Let us know how it goes!",

It seems to be just his back feet now they literally just fold underneath him. Has put a bit of weight back on and the only other symptom which i dont think i mentioned was hes loosing his hair not in clumps it just seems to be falling out??? He did have xrays done which didnt show anything and also tests for diabetes which were also negative. would appreciate any more suggestions. lillybob",
