            "answer": "I had the same problem for a couple of years... I had a urostomy... This is where they take a portions of the small bowel and place it in the bladder which leads to an opening on your stomach... It's like a straw... There is a bag hooked to the opening and that's where your urine goes into... You wear each bag for a few days then replace it... Emptying the bag when needed... This surgery is a very hard, painful, and long surgery but worth everything I went through... Not 1 UTI since the surgery and having that part of my health back is awesome... Constant UTI's and constantly being on antibiotics will really take it's toll on your body... If you have this surgery you will be amazed with how good you feel after you have healed from it... If you will google:\u00a0\u00a0Ileostomy surgery it should explain everything involved... I hope this helps you...Carol",

            "answer": "Hello,Your symptom is called polyuria (excessive frequency of voiding). It can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc). Accordingly you might need to take measures such as control of excessive liquid intake, reduction in diuretic substances/drugs, treatment of any infection (with short-course antibiotics), removal of any urinary tract obstruction, treatment of diabetes, etc as the case may be.Urostomy is not the only method of treatment and the cause needs to be identified first.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "My whole problem started with a UTI, i dont know why the antibiotics didnt deal with the problem. Its been 3 years now, i have constant urination urges, i go to the bathroom a lot even if i didnt drink that much.Ive taken many medicines but none seem to work, i had an operation where they injected botox into my bladder i believe, not sure. This did little to nothing. There is no way i can continue living like this, there must be a solution.Im thinking of doing an operation where they basically replace my penis with a tube of some sort, im not even sure if this will work. The problem is so terrible it has led me to this. How would the procedure actually work?Can someone tell me how advanced the field of urology is, like can they diagnose exactly what the problem is. Someone please help and tell me what my options are, i would hate to live my life without a penis.",
