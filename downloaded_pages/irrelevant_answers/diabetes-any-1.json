            "answer": "Crap just realized i didn't really answer your question... Some good foods i would say are fruits like berries and apples, whole grains, and proteins. Try to avoid white bread , white rice and bagels. Stick more with the brown selections brown rice, whole wheat bread, etc. Other complex carbs include potatoes which i try to limit myself to small portions. And try to stay away from simple sugars as well like sodas candy stuff like that. Everything seems to be okay in moderation but for us its important to be extra careful",
