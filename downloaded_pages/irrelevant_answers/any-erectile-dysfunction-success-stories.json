            "answer": "I have no experience on the matter nor particular knowledge. But knowing the erection mechanism, I understand that this condition may be sometimes difficult to deal with and cure.But please keep in mind that people have the tendency to show up and talk only when they have some problem. There are many satisfied ones that will never return to the board (not the present one necessarily) to tell their story. I cannot say to which extend this applies to ED cases, it is just how things generally work.",

            "answer": "A cure depends on the cause. these are the main causes vasuclar, diabetes, psychological, hormonal imbalance, organic cause (within the penis), smoking, being overweight, sexually confused, stress, not enough sleep...........The list is very long if say diabetes or a hormonal imbalance is causing it yes it can be cured when all levels are returned to normal. I would check the first five reasons I listed. Ask yourself these questions do you get spontaneous erections, erections during sleep, morning wood? If yes to all it is possible the cause is psychological. For the other causes erection quality can be improved, but I am not a urologist so I can't say if it can be cured.You should have a complete blood work done checking for cholesterol, thyroid function, blood sugar, free testosterone, serum testosterone, random testosterone, estradiol, cortisol, hepatic profile, prolactin, ....... be honest with your doctor and ask for his/her opinnon.\u00a0\u00a0Complete physical.\u00a0\u00a0Tell all symptoms even though some seem unimportant. To find a cure everything has to be presented to a qualified individual. It is kind of embarassing as I have been through it. Urologist deal with it all the time so they are better qualified and most professional/understanding.",

I am sorry for the rather non-appropriate term, but this is how I understand when I read what you wrote.Yes, of course it can be dangerous. It depends, but better be safe than sorry.",
