            "answer": "There is nothing that you can do to make your body heal any faster than it can.If you have diabetes or any type of immune disorder, then that will cause any type of wounds or sores to heal even slower.What I suggest you do is keep the sores dry and clean.\u00a0\u00a0You can purchase corn pads (depending on the size of your blister) and those may just keep the pressure off the burst blister to allow it to heal.If you cannot get a corn ring big enough, then make a cotton wood wadding so that your foot is not directly sitting on top of the shoe.\u00a0\u00a0This will keep the open sore from getting dirty.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not able to wear regular shoes, wear different footwear - trainers!Forget about being active until the skin has healed.\u00a0\u00a0Being active will put more pressure on the foot and delay healing.",

            "answer": "The blister skin should never be removed.When the fluid has gone down (sometimes it does need to be drained), the outer blister skin will keep the new skin underneath protected from bacteria and will dry and fall off once the underlying skin is healed.",
