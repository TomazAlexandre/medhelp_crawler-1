            "answer": "I just took this test a week or so ago...and failed. But it is really no big deal. You drink a small bottle of (orange) sugar stuff and wait an hour, then they draw your blood to see how your body processed the sugar. My doc did not have me fast, just told me not to eat any sugar before bed or for breakfast...it would jack up the test. I didn't eat before bed and only drank a little water before the test and still failed by 17 points. So I just had to do a 3 hour test...hopeing to have passed this one! So good luck!",

It's really simple, you just got to keep down the sugary stuff, that kindof tastes like a really really sweet koolaid, lol. Pretty gross. I am afraid I am going to fail. My baby was almost 2 lbs at my 22 week ultrasound, very large, and I was overweight to start with. My son was 9 lbs 13 oz, and I didn't develop it with him, but I am was heavier to start with with this one. aww anxiety lol. We will all be good. My friend had gestational diabetes and had and 11 lb 12 oz\u00a0\u00a0lil boy. Biggest baby I ever saw lol. I don't know how she stood up lol",

They give you 5 minutes to drink the verrrry sugary drink (mine was also punch flavored) and then you wait an hour, they take your blood and that's all! :]",

My first will be at 26 wks and then 2 after that. It is alot of waiting. You can eat before the test but while you wait to have your blood drawn no you can't. Just to warn you if you have the orange flavor you will never like orange soda again...LOL. Good luck and let me know what happens....AP",
