            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum,\u00a0\u00a0the sensation of being hungry is controlled in the brain by the Hypothalamus. The Thyroid controls this reflex. If you are having problems with hunger, then you should get the Thyroid checked with T3, T4 and TSH levels.Also you should undergo complete physical and blood sugar estimation (to rule out diabetes). This also needs to be differentiated with eating disorders. You also need to undergo weight reducing exercises which will help reduce symptoms of apnea. I suggest you to consult physician. Take care and regards.",
