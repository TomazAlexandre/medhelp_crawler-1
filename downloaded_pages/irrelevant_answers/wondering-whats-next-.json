            "answer": "Dear Debbie,The good news is that the majority of heart murmurs in young people are benign.\u00a0\u00a0Less common causes of a murmur in a young healthy person would include left ventricular hypertrophy, atrial septal defect, ventricular septal defect and other less common valvular defects.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing about his history suggest any of these to me.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that it is wise to get it checked out but it will probably turn out to be nothing.\u00a0\u00a0If something does turn up then at that point his doctor will probably refer him to a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0So don't spend too much time worrying until all the results are in.",

    "question": "HiI have a 17 yr old son that came home from a sports physical that said the dr. detected a heart murmur- I have taken him to the clinic the dr ordered blood tests-chest x-rays- EKG- echo test- said he would let us know friday the results- then need to see a heart dr. There is SO much heart/diabetes problems on my husbands side- my son came home from school early last week- said he felt his heart racing/ thought he was going to pass out- this was before he had even had any tests done- the dr mentioned that I had him in the ER not that long ago with high fever 103+ for a few days- he is also 6'1 weighs 159# ( he hasn't gained weight- he's pretty thin has worked out alot) - they took his blood pressure said it was too high 174/84. I think he has always had this problem, and was just caught now cuz of the sports physical--I knew it wasn't right when I brought him home from the hospital and he slepted all night long..my son says its stress from school- he's taking the hardest classes is on the A honor roll and does pages upon pages of homework- he has a part time job- plays golf and football too...the dr did say he heard that it was hard ? harding ? what do we expect when he says we will see a heart dr after he gives us the results ?thanks for any information-Debbie",
