            "answer": "Blood Sugars (BG) that is rapidly chainging can give the same fealings as Hypos.Also if your Body is used to BG that is 300 and you drop to 150 that is BG 150 points lower than your body is used to, thus your body thinks you going hypo.MDs LOVE to blame everything on \"your diabetes\" whether or not true!Keeping your BG even\u00a0\u00a0and see if your \"episodes\" continue.Carbs raise BG ALL carbe raise BG. bread will raise BG even whole wheat will raise BG.what diabetes meds are you on?What is you BG before you eat and what\u00a0\u00a0it is 1 hour after you eat? (you said it was 301 1.5 hours after eating 17 carbs but what was it BEFORE you eat?)BG 4 hours after eating could be considered almost fasting BG. fasting BG of 225 is very high so is 301\u00a0\u00a0after 17 gr of carbs.\u00a0\u00a0 I think (im not an MD) your BG is out of control.",

    "question": "I am very confused!I eat a low carb/high protein diet. A few days ago I went shopping just after having eaten my breakfast. It was 215 calories, 17 carbs and 31 protein.Within 1.5 hours my sugars spiked to 301. I ate some cheese and yogurt and within 1.5 hours they dropped to 179.My problem is that the symptoms are like that of hypoglycemia. I start to get clammy, confused, instant tears, I start to stutter and go into a blank stare.June of 2014 I had a grand mal (Tonic-clonic) epileptic seizure where I stopped breathing for about 30-40 seconds. They said it was due to my diabetes, this after having a CT scan, EEG, and EMG. Everything came back normal. That day, I had eaten a bowl of cereal (which I no longer eat) and at the time of the seizure my sugars were 255 and I hadn't eaten in over 4 hours.A few months later I had another \"episode\" as they are now calling it, and again, I hadn't eaten anything in about 4 hours.Since then, I have, on and off, had similar episode.I am not having episodes of hypoglycemia, since my sugars are HIGH, and when I read about the symptoms of hyperglycemia they all read......excessive thirst, irritability, frequent urination.....and so on. Nothing seems to explain my \"episodes\" other than hypoglycemia. (But my sugars are HIGH)Can someone enlighten me? Maybe someone out there has the same thing happening to them and they know the name for this. Any help is much appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0:)",
