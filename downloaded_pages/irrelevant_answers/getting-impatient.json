    "question": "So, to start off, I hate my ob. I love my regular Dr. Who delivered my first child, but after 2 consecutive miscarriages, she referred me to an on to handle my current pregnancy. I am currently 18 weeks and I have only seen my Dr twice, once at 6 weeks, and again at 10 weeks. She has only talked to me for about 30 min tops and doesn't seem to really care about me or any of my concerns. During this pregnancy, I have had some bleeding as well as a 4 inch ovarian cyst ...neither situation seemed to trouble my ob. I have now been diagnosed with gestational diabetes again and my Dr didn't even talk to me about it. She had her nurse call. So, I'm getting pretty close to 20 weeks and my Dr still has not contacted me about an appointment or an ultrasound. Whenever I call her office I get put on hold forever just to be told she already went home or is in surgery and they will have her call me back. Ugh... I am so worried about this pregnancy, but I haven't even heard a heartbeat in 2 months! Sorry to go on so long ladies, but I really just need to vent. Thanks for listening",
