    "question": "Hello, I'm a 22 year old mother of a 3 year old and i've been bleeding for almost 3 weeks stright. Prior to me getting my period this month, i hadn't had one for 5 months. I just had to have cervical cancer cells removed on january 13. I should also mention that i haven't had sex since November 9, 2008. I'm confused about what it could be, and why it could be lasting this long. my normal period length is between 4-6 days. and i miss those short ones...LOL...if anyone could help me with figuring out what could be wrong with me, i would GREATLY appreciate it. Thanks in advance",
