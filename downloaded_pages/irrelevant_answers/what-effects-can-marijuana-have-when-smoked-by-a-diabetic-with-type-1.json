            "answer": "Dear Ol',Thank you for reaching out to JDRF. I am not a physician and am not qualified to answer medical questions, but I can give you my personal knowledge as a longtime volunteer.First I have to state the obvious that smoking marijuanna is illegal. Having said that I am curious about your statement that your girlfriend is too good for pot. I would hope that you would also look at yourself as being too good to be smoking. Just something to think about.As far as having type 1 diabetes and taking any drugs that are mind altering have inherent dangers. First of all in an altered state a person who smokes pot may not feel a low blood sugar coming on until it is too late or they are in deep trouble. Another issue is that so many people get the \"munchies\" after and cannot either help but eat or because they are not thinking clearly, eat foods that are not good for them. As you probably know, how much and what she eats is so very important. This could easily swing her to a high blood sugar and neither of you may realise it until much later.You sound like a very caring boyfriend and have her best interests at heart. I would go with your first instinct and discourage any use of pot. I hope you will realize what a good person you are yourself and wish you both the best of luck.Take care,dm",
