            "answer": "Your doctor is going the wrong direction. You do not need T4 replacement hormones. You have too much T4 now.You need more tests run, and your doctor has no clue what he/she needs to be doing.There is a problem with your TSH, not your thyroid hormones. Tests need to be run on your pituitary, and antibody tests need to be run on your thyroid. ALL the antibody tests, not just the most common one.Synthroid will make you sick.Seek a second opinion, prefferably from an Endocrinologist that deals with thyroids every day, not a diabetes specialist.Best of luck with your problem. It may be something minor, but this doctor is not going to find it.",

            "answer": "That test range is really tight.The lab I use has a test range of 0.58-1.64I had my Free T4 and TSH checked the other day.My Free T4 was 1.49My TSH was 0.13, below lab limits and in the hyper catagory.My Free T4 is within range, but high enough to drive me hyper.Your Free T4 is above limits, and your TSH should be lower than mine.Even if our two samples of Free T4 were measured in the same manner, which is unlikely since the ranges are different, your TSH should be closer to 1.0, not above lab limits.Something is causing your TSH to be abnormally high.A test error, perhaps, or a malfunction somewhere.Or, it could be a test error on your Free T4. Who knows. I would get retested, by someone who knows how to read the tests.I would not take the Synthroid, especially if you are not having any symptoms.",
