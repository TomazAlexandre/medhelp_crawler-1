            "answer": "I have heard that Levothyroxine can cause you to gain weight. What is your TSH at now? My husband has diabetes and I have Hashimoto's of my thryoid. Are you a type 1 or type 2 diabetic? He is type 2 he started taking a new medication called byetta. You inject in your arm before you meals. My husband has lost 40 lbs in the last 6 months. He just can't eat like he used to since he has been on the byetta. It curves your appetite and apparently helps your body produce it's own insulin. It might be something you want to run by your endo doctor. Let me know.",
