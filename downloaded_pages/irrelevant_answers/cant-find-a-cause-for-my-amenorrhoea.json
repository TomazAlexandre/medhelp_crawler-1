            "answer": "Thanks for your reply.Unfortunately the things listed there have already been ruled out.The doctors ruled out the more common causes first-PCOSOvarian cystsAnovulationEarly menopauseScarring or any physical abnormalityThyroid diseaseDiabetesThen they looked at rarer stuff, but it was all ruled out-Growths inside the brain (adrenal glands, pituitary etc.)Various blood disordersVarious auto-immune disordersThey don't even seem to know what other tests to do. The most frustrating thing is that I can't find anyone else like me who has years amenorrhoea AND normal hormone levels.Most people I know (and who I've talked to online) have at least one hormone level that's off, or if their sex hormones are normal they'll have abnormal thyroid levels.At my most recent appointment I was told they'll just keep testing my hormone levels every year until one shows up abnormal and told me to expect to develop brittle bones and that I'm at higher risk of developing (but they won't give me extra screening).I feel like they've given up on me.",

    "question": "Hi, I've had amenorrhoea for the past 5 years and my doctors can't find the cause. The tests I've had were all negative or normal. They tested to see if I'm ovulating and I am. They also couldn't find any physical abnormalities. They decided it must be psychological and sent me to a psychologist. I did a some therapies but the psychologist said she didn't believe there was any psychological reason and it must be physical. Now the doctors don't what to do.My only symptoms are amenorrhoea and thinning pubic hair. My periods were regular before and I have no pain or anything like that. I'm otherwise healthy.I don't what to do about it any more.",
