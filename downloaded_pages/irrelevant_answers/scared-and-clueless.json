            "answer": "No your symptoms would not be related to HPV. With herpes you probably would have had an outbreak by now, but testing at 4 months is reliable.You have had negative tests and you should be very happy about that. I don't believe your symptoms are related to an STD. I think it is either something else or anxiety driven.Only advice I can give is to continue to follow up with your Dr. I would also suggest maybe trying to see a therapist. The mind is a powerful tool that can make us feel things that are not true.",

    "question": "Hello all - I have a concern, that is keeping me up at night. About 4 1/2 months ago, i had a drunken encounter with a friend of mine. (I'm a 23 year old male). She performed oral sex on me, we had brief penetration, and then continued with a condom. Soon after, i developed a 'feeling' in my penis, it didnt hurt, i just seemed to be extra aware of my penis. I then developed urinary urgency, felt like i had to go all the time. I also had a pain in my thighs, especially when sitting. At this point i freaked out, and was repeatedly tested for HIV, syphilis, gonorrhea, chlamydia, UTI's, and diabetes. All tests came back negative. I've had no fever, rash, lesions, itching, or bumps. My GP won't test me for herpes, he believes the tests are way too unreliable, and that i would have shown symptoms by now. I've been trying to find another clinic that will test me. My urologist thinks its prostatitis, but even after a digital rectal exam, no wbc's have shown up in my urine stream. I've asked the girl to get tested, and she (says) her results are negative as well. I do believe she has HPV however, im not sure which strain. Could that have caused these symptoms? If there's any other insight on this, it'd be greatly appreciated. Thanks..",
