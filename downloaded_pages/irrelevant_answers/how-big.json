Most babies if the come out around the due date will be 6-8 lbs if you go over your due date between 1-14 days which is the max they usually allow you'll be looking at a baby from 7-9 maybe 10 lbs but that's normal. My son was 10 days late they said he was a big baby but he came out at 8.8 lbs I pushed him out in 15 minutes.",

            "answer": "Well-controlled gestational diabetes doesn't usually result in oversized babies - it's usually only if you aren't diagnosed quickly or you don't modify your diet or take the prescribed meds/insulin that babies tend to grow so much. My son came right on time, day after his due date, and he was nine pounds - an unmedicated vaginal birth - after everyone told me he'd be about 7 maybe 7.5 pounds. So it's always just a guess even with ultrasound measurements. Big babies can absolutely be born vaginally, I have a friend who had a 10lb11oz babe vaginally with no issues and she's a small-framed woman. Don't worry a bit. Remind yourself that you're strong and capable and your body was built for this and there's nothing to be afraid of. You can do it.",
