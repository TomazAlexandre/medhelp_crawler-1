            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, you may be probably having Circadian rhythm disorders. Due to long term sleep deprivation in night time or delay in sleep will lead to excessive sleepiness, tiredness, loss of concentration and even dizziness.This usually has happened due to change in normal sleep-wake cycle. Disturbance of sleep cycle disorder can be due to stress, anxiety, depression. Even generalized disease or conditions can cause such symptoms; hence this needs to be ruled out.Generalized conditions needed to be ruled out are anemia, Diabetes, steroid use, thyroid disorder (hypothyroidism), blood disorder and dietary deficiencies. You need to take healthy food like vegetables, fruits, milk etc with minimum 7-8 hrs sleep.Firstly you need to undergo routine blood tests like complete blood count, differential count, ESR, Hb% and thyroid profile etc. Also you need to get evaluated for neck disorder which is interrupting your sleep and may be the cause for your problem.If stress is present, you need to go for relaxation exercises. Appropriate use of sedatives (benzodiazepines) will help you to get adequate sleep. I suggest you to consult a physician and get treated for recovery of normal sleep-awake cycle. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "I am always tired and it seems no matter how early I go to bed I rarely, if ever, wake up feeling good and well rested.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I have sleep apnea - I'm not over-weight and I'm pretty sure my husband would tell me if I were snoring all night.\u00a0\u00a0Could this just be from stress?\u00a0\u00a0Can stress disturb your sleep?\u00a0\u00a0A lot of times I do feel like I'm partially awake during the night - maybe just sleeping very lightly.\u00a0\u00a0I have a chronic neck problem which I'm sure also effects my sleep because I'm either in some pain/discomfort or I'm kind of sleepily aware of the position of my head and neck...\u00a0\u00a0I try to eat right and TRY to get some exercise throughout the week because I know these things can be helpful - but I'm still just exhausted way too often!Any help would be greatly appreciated!!\u00a0\u00a0 (by the way, not crazy about the idea of sleep meds...)Thanks!!",
