            "answer": "\"I was diagnosed with diabetes last year\"Controlling and managing your diabetes is an important step in avoiding other health risks, something you have not told us about so we cannot help you unless you provide us with more information.Have you spoken with or seen a doctor? Your symptoms mimic an internal infection that is worsening. You're not going to find an answer nor a cure on any health forums, only from a thorough medical evaluation by a doctor. Please do not put off seeing one. Good luck",

            "answer": "I admit, for the longest time after I was diagnosed with diabetes, I continued to eat & drink whatever I wanted. But I eventually (about 6 months ago) changed my diet. I cut out sodas & as much fattening foods as possible. I increased my fruit & water intake, & I started walking at least 20 minutes every couple days. At my heaviest, I was at 311. I'm now at 275. Admittedly still on the heavy side, but just as it didn't take me a day to gain the weight, it will take me longer than a day to shed the weight.My doctor's office was in transition (firing & hiring) &, as a result, only had 1 doctor available. I went to the office but was told by the nurse in charge that unless it was life-threatening, I should call back to see when they'd have more than 1 doctor available. I called today to schedule an appointment & was told that they'd give me a call back. Because I don't have health insurance, & this office allows me to be on a sliding scale (much lower payments), I'm somewhat out of options. I can either be seen at this office & still provide for my family or I can go to the ER & possibly end up late on other bills. I'm not expecting to find a \"cure\" as you put it; rather, I'm wondering if anyone has experienced these symptoms before or could help lead me in the right direction. Thank you for your input.",

    "question": "About 3-4 weeks ago, I came down with what I thought was just a common cold. But then it got worse - I had diarrhea, vomiting, and conjunctivitis. A few days later, I noticed my calf muscles had tightened, feeling almost as if in suspended cramp. A few days after that, I noticed I had joint pain in my knees. This quickly spread to the rest of my joints (I.e. ankles, toes, wrists, fingers) simultaneously. I was diagnosed with diabetes last year, & I was started on a birth control pill to regulate my cycle (I had been losng a lot of blood which resulted in anemia & iron deficiency. Because of this, I had to have a blood transfusion). Now, aside from a tickle in my throat, I only have joint pain. I've been taking 800MG of Ibuprofen which seems to help tremendously, but what could be causing this inflammation in my joints?",
