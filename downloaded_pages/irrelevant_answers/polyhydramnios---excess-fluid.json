    "question": "Had any one had this and gone to full term I'm now 31 weeks but I went to an appointment at 30 weeks but was measuring 35. I was sent for a gestational diabetes test and I haven't heard back which usually means no news is good news. I have a scan booked for Wednesday to check why there is so much fluid. But silly old me googled and most people go in to preterm labour according to me google. I have just got over bv and stopped worrying about early labour from that and now this!\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be greatly appreciated.",
