            "answer": "thank you for your kind words.......but please do not take what i posted as the notion that my b/f is now cured b/c he is not even close........we have a long road in recovery and there are many obstacles that will allow for relapse on his part as well as relapse for myself in how i handle his addiction and how i handle myself.........i am just hoping that in some way i can be an encouragement to anyone in that there is another choice and all you have to do is take the necessary steps........this has been the scariest 16 days of my life and trust me i thought that i had some scary days while he was in active addiction --- but being sober is WAY more scary b/c he is having to learn to do everything SOBER --- EVERYTHING!!!\u00a0\u00a0he will be in meetings and continuing care for the rest of his life.......but that is totally okay with me b/c if he was diagnosed with cancer i wouldn't leave him - i would take care of myself so that i in turn could take care of him and together we would handle the disease.just know that if you are the addict that your recovery is totally 100% up to YOU - no one else has the right to dictate what you will and won't do.........although friends and family often think they are doing waht is best - if you don't understand something how can you ever come up with a solution...........i don't think you can.GOD LOVE U and keep safe b/c you have a job to do - and that job is to be you b/c no one else can do that job better that you!!!!have an awesome day!!!",

    "question": "i just wanted to give an update - for those of you who remember my previous posts my b/f is addicted to pain pills - loritab is his DOC and he went to inpatient rehab on october 27 2008..........well he came home on yesterday and i was able to attend a 3 day family program at the facility where he was at.......it was INCREDIBLE! and i am so thankful that i attended..........i now understand that addiction is a DISEASE of the brain and while my b/f is is ACTIVE ADDICTION he has lost the ability to see right and wrong and that is the destructive nature of his disease...............i have a totally different outlook on the progression of this disease and the progression of RELAPSE!i beg any of you out there that have the ability to get into a rehab facility to get into one BUT remember that they ARE NOT All the same and in order to gain the knowledge that you need in order to treat your disease and keep it under control you have to be given the correct tools!!!think of it like this:a person has been diagnosised with type 2 diabetes - well, if you don't TREAT the disesase with the proper medication i.e., insulin, eating right, etc then you will have a relapse of your diabetes........it is gonna happen, no getting around it!ADDICTION IS NOT BEHAVORIAL!!!\u00a0\u00a0yes there needs to be behavior changes once you are clean BUT you will always have this disease - just like you would always have cancer or diabetes - it is always there it is just in REMISSION - ---drug addicts are NOT bad people doing bad things - they are SICK people doing bad things.............i am SO thankful that i took the necessary time to understand my b/f's disease and now we can take the steps to HELP him manage this disease NOT ENABLE it by not being educated!thank you so very much to everyone who for the last 2 weeks have responded to my ramblings of hurt and dispair.....yes i am still hurt........addiction, just as any other disease effects everyone that is around the addict but i have now a different insight on why things happen the way they happen and what my part is in helping MYSELF with my co-dependency issues.................there is hope.........there really is.......but i have also learned that a TRUE addiction to opiates very rarely ever gets better or even manageable without proper treatment...............GOD BLESS everyone on this site and i pray that you can find the strength and the support to manage your disease...........GOD LOVE YOU ALL!!!!",
