            "answer": "I agree with the good advice everyone else has given you!An additional idea, is to take your mother to a large teaching hospital's ER (Emergency Room), and tell them that she won't live unless they PUT HER INTO THAT HOSPITAL IMMEDIATELY, and immediately start some intravenous feedings, taking into account her diabetes, & any other conditions your mom may have!!!This sounds like a MEDICAL EMERGENCY to me, and maybe your family doctor can help to have your mom admitted IMMEDIATELY to a GOOD hospital (if there are any near you!)to get some better medical care! She needs DIAGNOSIS AND EMERGENCY TREATMENTS NOW!!Sincerely, Concerned ladyhttp://cantbreathesuspectvcd.com",

            "answer": "Contact the Cleveland Clinic for more advice about the gastroparesis treatments they do, and I'll do a \"cut & paste\" of ta website they have, about this. You can SPEAK WITH A REGISTERED NURSE (RN), by CALLING (216) 444-1234, AT THE CLEVELAND CLINIC. Do this AFTER YOU HAVE YOUR MOM IN A BETTER HOSPITAL WITH NICER, SMARTER DOCS!!!Here's a link that will get you to the \"cut & paste\" article below:http://www.clevelandclinic.org/gastro/motility/paresis.htmAlso, when your mom is doing better, later on, read the book REVERSING DIABETES, by Dr. Julian Whittaker, M.D., because if the diabetes is improved, the gastroparesis MIGHT also improve.But, NOW, go to a better Emergency Room at a better hospital, first.Here's the \"cut & paste\". I hope this helps a little.************************************The term gastroparesis implies weakness of the stomach. Following a meal, the stomach starts a slow process of grinding the food so that only very small pieces pass into the small intestine, to be absorbed. This process may take a few hours to complete, depending on the size of the meal and the type of food. It requires a fine coordination between the muscle of the stomach, nerves and hormones. When any of these factors are impaired, the food takes a while to empty, resulting in nausea, vomiting and weight loss.What causes gastroparesis?One of the most common diseases causing gastroparesis is diabetes, particularly when it affects different parts of the body and when insulin is required. It also common in women after certain viral infectionsWhat are the symptoms?Initially patients may feel bloated and full after small amounts of food, and limit the size of their meals. Later, patients can experience nausea and vomiting after meals, which when severe may result in weight loss because of decreased food intake.How is gastroparesis diagnosed?Because blockage of the stomach or small bowel can produce the same symptoms, an endoscopy or x-ray study must be performed initially. If there is no blockage, then a gastric emptying study (which measures how quickly an egg sandwich is emptied from the stomach), manometry (measurement of the strength of contractions of the stomach) or an electrogastrogram (measurement of the electrical activity of the stomach, like an EKG) are performed.How is gastroparesis treated?",

    "question": "My mother has been in the hospital for 13 days without food or nutrition.\u00a0\u00a0She has no insurance and the doctor assigned to her is very cold and seems to have no compassion.\u00a0\u00a0A gastroenterologist has visited her and performed a stomach scope. They believe that she has gastroparesis but no other tests have been performed.\u00a0\u00a0The cold doctor has said, \"listen, you have to get a feeding tube.\u00a0\u00a0It will be permanent, you will never eat food again\".\u00a0\u00a0Pretty much deal with it. I have tried to gather information about this condition and I have not read where the tube is always permanent and I feel that other studies should be done to determine what is wrong but on the other hand I want her to get some nutrition soon.\u00a0\u00a0She is diabetic and has been not eating very much for a long time.\u00a0\u00a0She is very anxious and rocking in the bed and I feel that this doctors actions have contributed to her state of anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0I took her out of the county hospital in Fort Worth after they had overlooked her for a week and do not want to move her again but I do not know what I should do?Any Advice?",
