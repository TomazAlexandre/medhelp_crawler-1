    "question": "Okay, so I took my glucose test last month and the results showed no gestational diabetes, but they said I'm anemic. So, I'm taking iron pills in addition to the prenatal vitamins. What are the risks of bring anemic while pregnant? I've always been anemic, but the doctor hadn't instructed me to take the iron pills until recently, and I'm 32 Weeks along. Also, will they test my blood again to see if it's improved? Thanks!",
