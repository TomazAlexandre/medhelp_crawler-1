            "answer": "Dear Dr John:I am very appreciated for your reply. I wear glasses before I get the cataract. My right eye is with -3.0D myopia and my left eye is -2.0D. I am ok to wearing a glasses but i do not want to change the glasses i wear all the time because it makes me feel suffering as a young guy. I have thought about wearing progressive multi-focal spectacles after my left eye's operation. However, some article points out that it is very inconvenient and not suitable for all people especially the one who need todeal with computer and books. Therefore i want to choose a suitable lens that can make me see clear in all distance.I never smoke and drinks little. I don't have obesity/diabetes and never get trauma. The cataract happens from 2012.1, at first it makes me feel odd but i can stiil do good in the visual testing chart. However it gets worse soon and now i can see a white dot in the middle of my Pupil.The doctor here tell me that they can not find out any specific reason of my cataract. They give me some eyedrops and tell me i can wait some time before my operation. Should i wait for the new lens? Now i can not wathc the computer screen with two eyes because my left eyes would feel veryodds and dazzling. I have to close my left eye while i see the tv or computers which are shiny. However i can do good while reading.I feel very suffering but i can still have 0.7 in the\u00a0\u00a0visual testing chart. because i am good to see the things with black color.",

            "answer": "An option that has worked well for young people in similiar situation: have a monofocal IOL put in the LE with a targeted post op refraction of -2.00. You would be able to read and use eyes together for computer WITHOUT glasses and see at distance well out of both eyes. With your glasses on you would not be able to read or see computer UNLESS you put a bifocal on the LE post op.Most patients just let the RE do the work for reading and computers with glasses on and remove to use together.\u00a0\u00a0This is least expensive, least complications and does not involve waiting if your LE is bothersome now.JCH MD",

            "answer": "Dear Dr John:I am very thankful for your reply. However, i am concerned about the posterior capsule opacification which would happend to the young patients easily. Although the YAG could remove the opacification, it would cause the problem of retinal tear too from some articles' points of view. I am 22 now so i do worry about the potential risk of retinal tear after the YAG.\u00a0\u00a0Is it really dangerous the do the YAG? How could i prevent the posterior capsule opacification ? or should i use the Synchrony IOL which declares it can prevent the opacification and give some accomodating power? But i also worry about the astigmatism for it needs a large surgical incision.I appreciate your plan but i afraid that i can not build binocular vision function while i wear the glasses. Because i have to wear glasses to read and use the computer now. What about the accomodating lens? Which accomodating lens you think it is good and suitable?(Or multifocal lens?)Looking forward to your reply!",

            "answer": "We are not a substitute for your physician Eye MD nor can we plot a course of action for you.This is my last comment. Because you are young the chance of the posterior capsule turning cloudy is high relative to older patients. Overall the rate of capsular clouding with new IOLs is about 30%.\u00a0\u00a0If Yag capsulotomy is done the increased risk of a RD is generally small 1-2% for most people.Your other concerns and questions have been discussed many times and had many answers by forum ophthalmologists. You can access them with search feature and archives. I have no more to add.JCH MD",

    "question": "I am a 22 cataract patient and my left eye with mild cataract is still not operated. My right eye is fine and my left eye is with astigmatism less than 1D.I don't know how could the cataract happend to us as we are so young. The doctors here could not tell me why\uff0ctoo. I am suffering as I am a financial analyst who has to deal with the computer the whole day. Therefore, I do want to see clear in both far and near after operation.I do some research and konw that there are some accomodating lens as Tetraflex or Crystalens. But the adjustment power is very low and may cause retinal detachment as some articles talked about.I do some researches about the multifocal but they seem to have many problems and some people tell me that they are not good.Should I wait the new lens such as powervision or nulens? Or are there some lens suitable for me?I hope to get some advice here.Looking forward to your reply!",
