            "answer": "I am not saying this in the case of your mother difinitively (as I am no doctor), but ABSOLUTELY anxiety can cause vision problems. In fact, in a way, anxiety can manifest itself into nearly any symptom imaginable. But, yes, adrenaline affects the sympathetic and parasympathtic nervous system, which includes vision. Although I have been nearly anxiety free for about a year now, I still get the visual problems associated with my anxiety - it is probably one of my biggest lingering symptoms.And here is anecdotal evidence that it is true. There for a while, my vision was very blurry at times. At the time, I was having lots of anxiety and some panic, so I went to the eye doctor during one of my blurry spells. Turns out I needed a small prescription for nearsightedness with slight astigmatism. A couple of days later, I had the glasses on and everything went blurry, that is until I took them off. So I went back and was calm and not having any anxiety. Wouldn't you know it - 20/20 without glasses. The doc thought I must have been crazy, but it really happenend that way. Now, I simply do not wear them unless I am having anxiety-caused burriness, then I put them on - kinda like superman!! :)Mike",

    "question": "My mother has had blurred distant vision for several months.\u00a0\u00a0She has had early stage glaucoma for several years, which is being successfully treated with eye drops, and during the past year, she has had every eye test available, including specialist consultations, which have ruled out any physical cause. Although she has had glaucoma for some years, it never affected her vision, and at her most recent consultation a few weeks ago, the specialist was very happy with the pressure and condition of her eyes, which he said had improved.\u00a0\u00a0I think her vision problems are caused by stress, especially as her eyesight is sometimes fine, especially if she is looking through a car window, or if she is sheltering underneath an umbrella. My father has vascular dementia, which has become worse over the last few months, and it has been suggested that my mother's vision problems could be caused by anxiety, as she is subject to quite a lot of stress.\u00a0\u00a0It has been explained that adrenalin can cause the pupils to dilate, allowing too much light in, which can affect the vision.\u00a0\u00a0However, my mother is not convinced, and keeps asking for more checks and eye tests, even though she has had several over the last year.\u00a0\u00a0Regardless of how many specialists try to reassure her that her eyes are fine, and her eyesight is good, she won't believe them, and has made yet another appointment with the optician.\u00a0\u00a0Can you please tell me if anxiety can cause blurred vision?",
