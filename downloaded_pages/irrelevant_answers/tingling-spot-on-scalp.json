            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Localized tingling on the scalp can be due to dandruff, eczema, dermatitis, or due to anxiety even. It can also be due to affection of a peripheral nerve due to diabetes or at times no cause is found out. You can consult your PCP for primary examination and then show a dermatologist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
