            "answer": "So your doctor didnt advise you to come off it? Normally you would experience withdrawals but to what extent can depend on dose, length of time etc. I think that you should go in and see your doctor and he can give you specifics on what to expect.",

            "answer": "thanks for you response. I didn't really feel anything but then again I'm not sure. I did fill it again and started yesterday. I guess I always thought I was taking too much meds. I have 2 dif meds for diabetes and I also take ambien at night to sleep. I have a hard time sleeping through. I just thought if I eliminated one med it would be that much less. I think I was wrong because I was in tears yesterday and at the store while I was in line picking up the celexa. I don't know if that would happen if i didn't stop or not. I have been on an emotional roller coaster so i don't know whether Celexa is working or not. While on it I have also experience stress so thats why I thought it isn't helping.",

    "question": "I stopped using Celexa about 5 days ago, just stopped. I don't notice anything. Can there be any problems I should look for? I feel it just took \"the edge\" off and not sure I should stay on it.",
