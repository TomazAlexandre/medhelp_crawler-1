            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The painful itchy rash that cause raised areas on scratching look like fungal infection or tinea or ringworm. This can be overcome by applying a combination antifungal cream. Many treatment options are there like Clotrimazole 1%, Miconazole nitrate 2%, Tolnaftate 1%, ketoconazole, terfibnafine and Butenafine hydrochloride 1%. Many OTC products containing these salts are available, your pharmacist can help. Try a combination of two and apply until the rash you see disappears. Continue application for 2 weeks after the rash disappears. The cause for persistence is that the treatment is often left in between. Meanwhile test for blood sugar level to see if it is high for diabetes too can prevent resolution of fungal infection. Keep the area dry, wear loose fitting clothes, and change undergarments at least twice a day.If within 14 days there is no improvement, then consult a skin specialist for a reassessment of diagnosis. The rash can be dermatitis or eczema too if it does not respond to antifungals.You will need to consult a skin specialist for this. Hope this helps. Take care!",
