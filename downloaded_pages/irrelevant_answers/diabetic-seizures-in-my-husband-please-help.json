            "answer": "I am not a physician, but the mom of a type one diabetic and the daughter of a type 2. I would suggest that you discuss these seizures with your endocrinologist immediately.\u00a0\u00a0Your husband could be having low while having the seizure, or coming down too fast from a high. By the time it is done as the body is release stored glucagons, and when you check the blood it seems normal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0There could also be other things that are causing it.There is a genetic test that you can have done for your son but this will only tell you if has the gene not if he\u00a0\u00a0will get diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunate there is no way to prevent or to predict who will and who will not get diabetes.You did not state whether your husband is on a pump or shot.\u00a0\u00a0I would also ask you r doctor about the continuous glucose monitor.\u00a0\u00a0This might help narrow down what is really going on with your husbands, blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0There is also a pump that has the monitor with it.",

            "answer": "Has he seen in a neurologist?Not just in the ER, I mean, but for a more extensive workup. It's not impossible that he has a seizure disorder (e.g., some form of epilepsy) that is not related to his diabetes. An electroencephalogram (EEG) could be helpful, even, if necessary, a 24-hour one if they couldn't otherwise catch the seizure activity. Good luck.",

I dont know what to do. we also have a 6 year old son. what should I lokk for in him to know if he is going to get it too. before my husband would only get them like once in a while and only once a day every like couple of weeks but now he is getting them sometimes twice a day. could he maybe need to be on seizure meds? again the docs never find anything wrong with him.",
