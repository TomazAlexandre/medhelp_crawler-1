            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You must already be having diabetic neuropathy and this must have got aggravated on your getting tripped. Hence you must get your diabetic status re-assessed by going for glycosylated hemoglobin, fasting and PP blood sugar. Also a nerve conduction study may be required. You may need to take Vit B supplements. Please consult your diabetes specialist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
