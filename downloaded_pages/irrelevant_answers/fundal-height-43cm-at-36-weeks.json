    "question": "hi new hereare there any other reasons or conditions that would explain a sudden high fundal height measurement. other than big baby of course or humam errormy boy has been at the top of the charts all along my pregnancy so i expected a bigish baby. my daughter was also big at 9lb5had a growth scan at 34 weeks and yhey estimated he was 6lb. but in the 2 weeks since then hes jumped off the charts and the midwife seemed very worried so i have to go see the consultant next weeki was wondering if there was any explanation for a fundal height measurement to jump so much in so little time when hes been following the 85percentile curve to the dot every week up till nowthanks",
