            "answer": "I pray your 3 hour comes back normal but......just to let you know, it is not the end of the world like I thought it would be! I have easily adjusted to everything. It took me a week to get things where I knew what I could and could not eat but after that it was nothing. The main thing I have to watch is bread and potatoes. And the finger pricking is nothing. I started off doing it 4 times a day and now she lets me do it 3 times a week because my sugars have been so good. And by the way...... with my second child I did fail the first test and pass the 3 hour. So good luck! O yea, I still can eat sweets just in moderation. It is the carbs you have to watch. I have found the Adkins dessert bars really are not bad. Danielle",

            "answer": "Thanks you guys. The thing that bums me out the worst is giving up the bread and pasta. I'm a stickler for not eating what they say you shouldn't and then some. I don't eat any artificial sweetner, msg, cold cuts because of nitrates, and that doesn't include all the regulars they tell you not to eat. So I have been saved with pizza and pasta. I'm just so convinced I'll fail the 3 hour test that it's as if I already have. I take that next Wednesday, the 16th. Oh, and I didn't eat anything before this test. I hadn't eaten after 8 pm the night before and drank the drink at 8:30 am, so that's part of why I'm not that hopeful. But, I'm sure I'll adjust, I always do. And I will do whatever is best for the baby. I just thought I had 12 more weeks before I had to start my diet :o)Debra",

When is yours?Jenni, I so feel that it's because of all the bread and pasta I eat, but I'm hearing from other people who eat that way that they were fine, so it could just be the way my body reacts to pregnancy: Possible diabetes and I stop my watches ;o)",

I now feel like there is a chance I'll pass the 3 hour test. And the 3 hour test has the 1 hour level at 180 or higher as a fail, so if I stay consistent, I shouldn't be over 180 if I was 146 this time. I'm still going to take this as a wake up call and change some of the ways I've been eating and even if I pass the 3 hour test, keep trying to watch what I eat better. Less carbs.",
