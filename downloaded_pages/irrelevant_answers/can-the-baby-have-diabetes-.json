            "answer": "If it doesn't run in the family there is a very slim chance the baby will have diabetes. If you do end up with gd do what the Dr suggest you do or there is a chance after the baby is born you could go full blown diabetic. And if you do get gd that does not mean the baby will have diabetes. Just means that your pancreas isn't working enough to support both you and baby without support. Gd can in the end make the rest of the pregnancy, labor and birth slightly more difficult. I have preexisting diabetes, march will be 5 years. Gestational diabetes is pretty much the same thing but mine won't go away and I've already had it.",

            "answer": "Gestational diabetes isn't caused by it running in the family. Its caused when your pancreas can't do enough on its own to support the mother and baby. That's why it usually goes away after is because your pancreas isn't doing overtime",
