I was trying to google my symptoms and came across your post.\u00a0\u00a0I am glad to see that I am not the only one experiencing something similar.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted on what you find out.Thanks,Angela",

I guess I'll know more after that...it's Monday the 24th, so for all you out there with similar symptoms I'll keep you posted.p.s. the doctor mentioned tarsal tunnel (carpal tunnel of the feet) as a possible diagnosis, but it doesn't explain all the symptoms.p.s.s. my shoes fit... lol... I ran 20-30 miles a week for 5+ years in the army, and ran a marathon in 2003... I know how to find properly fitting shoes, and not to tie them too tight.",

    "question": "I'm a healthy age 25 male (no diabetes).\u00a0\u00a0I've been experiencing numbness from running. It usually only happens if I run more than 4 or 5 miles (35-45mins of exercise)....but doesn't happen every time. It starts in either one or both of my feet as a slight tingling, then goes to tingling numbness, then total numbness as if my feet were asleep. If I stop running, it stops spreading...however if I continue running, it spreads to my ankles, and up my legs. After I'm done running feeling returns to my feet, ankles & legs in about 5-10 minutes of inactivity.This is very annoying as I'm trying to build my distance up to run my second marathon. I ran the 2003 Honolulu marathon without this issue affecting me (luckily)... even though periodically during that time I was experiencing this issue as well (although then it was only after running 8 or 9 miles or further [1 to 1.5 hours of exercise]).Please help... I've been dealing with this for several years now. Today my general care physician gave me a possible diagnoses of tarsal tunnel, but is referring me to a specialist for further testing. During my time in the Army (2000 - 2005) I saw numerous doctors, none of which helped in any way...they just gave me 800mg motrin and sent me on my way.",
