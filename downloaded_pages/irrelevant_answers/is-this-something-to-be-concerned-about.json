            "answer": "Many women develop thyroidits (goiter and swelling) after giving birth and it usually resolves itself, but sometimes it doesn't. In my case, after I gave birth I developed Hashimoto's thyroiditis. I take thyroid medication that has shrunk my nodules/goiter.So no depression, constipation, diarrhea, fatigue, weight gain, depression, anxiety, weight loss, trembling hands, leg pains, arthritis like swelling or pain in joints?These symptoms are signs of thyroid disease.When we discovered I had nodules, the soonest my endocrinologist could see me for an ultrasound was two weeks. My nodules were biopsied and discovered to be benign. Most nodules are benign, but in the rare event they are cancerous, thyroid cancer has a very high cure rate.The best type of doctor to examine nodules would be an endocrinologist, but one who specializes in thyroid, not diabetes.Take care...:) Tamra",

            "answer": "I suppose that depends on the endo and the insurance policy. I just booked an appointment looking for a second opinion because I'm not happy with my endo. His office did not require a referral, but I'm paying out of pocket. Go to the website below to find an endo/internal medicine doc with high recommendations doc for you.:) Tamrahttp://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/",

    "question": "Hi,I am 29 years old and over the last month I have developed a hard lump at the base of my throat that has grown, it is now clearly visible especially when I swallow. I saw my FNP at work and she said it was a thyroid nodule and took my blood work and scheduled a ultrasound for 2 weeks from now. She seemed concerned due to my age and the size of the nodule. My question is should I try and see a primary physician and get an ultrasound sooner?Of note, I also gave birth 7 months ago but have no other related symptoms except a feeling of fullness in my throat.Thank you.LH",
