He told me to eat like i normally do. So i did, b/c i want my test results to be precise, so i won't hurt my baby.I've noticed others that had to take the 3-hour tried eating less sugar, etc. and passed it, but what if you go back to eating normal and u really do have gd and that can hurt the baby, make it serverly overweight, etc.So i was dianosed with g/d, and am on a strict diet, plus take insulin, which they will start you off on the diet, and see if the diet will control your g/d, and if it will you won't have to take the insulin. But my sugar was still high and i was staying on my diet very strictly. So i take the insulin.So i hope u don't have it! Good luck!",

At first i was sooooo scared to give myself the shot(the 1st time) i was scared the way i was going to feel afterwards. But i felt fine. And dr told me to aslways keep candy with me incase my sugar drops to far down, and i start feeling weird. So try that incase it ever happens.yes i do sit to give myself the shot, i was told that i could give it to myself in my arm, leg, stomach. But i was scared to do it in my stomach since i'm prego, but i would only hit fat right now if i pinched it up. My leg is also really sore afterwards, gosh!And at first i didn't watch to see if i was aiming for a vein, and hit one, but now i make sure i am not aiming for a vein.I'm trying to remember everything u talked about but i know i'll leave something out. lolWell i'll give u my email addresss incase u want to talk anymore about this! I really appreciate talking to u, it does help!yes i do get depressed about the high levels b/c i do not cheat in the mornings, sometimes i will at lunch. But it's not bad, and the frigin sugar isn't high after lunch!Well here is my emaili won't answer that until monday though, as to it being my work email.***@****",

I give myself the shot anyways.And the reason they don't want the air bubbles in it, is b/c no air is supposed to go into your vein, incase you hit one accidently. I have hit my vein twice now, and oh man it hurts afterwards! wheeeeeeeeewwww. So now i am watching where i stick myself and make sure there are no veins in the way. Sometimes when i don't hit a vein and hit the right spot some of my insulin actually comes back out. weird huh!But just get the air bubbles out the best you can, and watch it and make sure u don't hit a vein.Where do you give yourself the shot at?? I have only did it in my leg. And i do it in the mornings. My levels are pretty good except in the mornings after breakfast! Other times they are fine. And my dr wants my levels at 120 or lower 1 hr after meals. and 95 or lower before breakfast in the morning.When are yours higher?",

I'm afraid of hitting a vein too, but haven't done it yet.\u00a0\u00a0Thankfully!They told me that the insulin hurts less (the actual shot) than the finger testing and I agree, but they didn't tell me how much it hurts afterwards.\u00a0\u00a0After I give myself the shot of insulin I'm very sore and can't sleep on the side I gave it in.Do you keep your insulin in the refridgerator? I was told I didn't have to, but then I read the pamphlet and it says to keep in the the fridge.\u00a0\u00a0So I moved it there today.\u00a0\u00a0But I've also read that cold insulin hurts a lot more.Thanks for the help with the air bubbles.\u00a0\u00a0I was so tired and frustrated last night that I had to give up and not give myself the shot. I just couldn't take it any longer.\u00a0\u00a0I was crying and it just sucked.Oh, both my sister and sister-in-law had GD with their previous pregnancies (my sister didn't have test or take medication, don't know how that happened) and both had babies that weighed 6 pounds and some change.\u00a0\u00a0In case hearing individual cases helps you feel better.Also, (sorry this is so long!) have you suffered any depression because of the GD? I find myself get a little sad about my numbers when they are higher (like my fasting numbers and how no matter what I do -- I have not \"cheated\" -- I can't get them down) I get sad about it.",
