            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to menopause/hormonal imbalance of PCOD, anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit B12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 Postviral fatigue syndrome is another possibility. Persisting EBV infection or mono can also be the cause.There is a possibility that your heart, kidney, liver and pancreas are not functioning 100% and hence tests to determine their functional capacity should be done like glomerular filtration rate, blood urea and serum creatinine, liver function tests, pancreatic amylase and lipase, blood sugar fasting and after food etc. Thyroid function, hemoglobin, peripheral blood smear, serum iron level etc should also be assessed.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP to run tests and examination that have not been done to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
