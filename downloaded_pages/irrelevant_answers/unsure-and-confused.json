            "answer": "It is a shame that medicines for T2 diabetes doesn't mix well with heart disease. If these sensations you are having now, resemble those that you had with or before your heart attack, I would head to the ER. Have you any fast acting nitro to see if it stops these sensations? Don't forget to take an aspirin if you think you are having a heart attack. Good luck.....",

    "question": "I am a diabetic who had a mild heart attack in Nov., 05.\u00a0\u00a0At that time, my symptom was a tingling sensation on each side of my sternum - both at rest but especially with exertion.\u00a0\u00a0Still, once at the ER, I was surprised to learn I'd had a mild heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0I had two drug-eluting stents placed in clogged arteries.\u00a0\u00a0SInce then, I've been taking several medications for heart and diabetes, including Plavix, aspirin and now Actos for the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Since last Wednesday, I've had very vague, very mild sensations - you could call it - not pain, in the center of my chest. No trouble breathing, no pain radiating.\u00a0\u00a0I've made an appointment with my cardiologist but the appointment is not for another 13 days.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be seeing someone sooner?\u00a0\u00a0Also, I've read that the medical community is having some issues with Actos as well as the drug-eluting stents.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I know that vague symptoms can be an issue with women and diabetics.",
