            "answer": "I do agree that with anxiety and depressive disorders, there isn't always some kind of deep rooted issue that needs discovered and explored.\u00a0\u00a0With my panic disorder, that wasn't the case at all, and actually, I spent a lot more time TRYING to figure out the \"why\" instead of just addressing the issues at hand.That being said....therapy is still VERY helpful, even IF there isn't an underlying reason behind the depression.\u00a0\u00a0Therapy can teach you tools to use to help yourself, beyond what the medication does.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it's just so cathartic to \"unload\" all of those stessors on someone who has no stake in your life.\u00a0\u00a0Therapy doesn't have to be about just finding some buried reason for our woes.I couldn't agree more with all of the wise posters here that getting help is not at ALL \"giving in\"....it's taking a hugely important step forward..its acknowledgeing that the issue is bigger that you, and that you need help getting through it.\u00a0\u00a0With the amounts of medications on the market, and numerous kinds of therapy, there is just NO reason these days that a person should suffer needlessly with depression.\u00a0\u00a0We know SO much more than we did about these kinds of disorders than we did even 20 years ago. The field is forever evolving and recognizing that a LOT of people suffer from one kind of disorder of another.\u00a0\u00a0We live in an awfully stressful world, it only makes sense that there has been such a rise in the numbers of people afflicted.Do it, make that phone call to your doc...ask for a referral to a psychiatrist, who can properly diagnose you and start exploring treatment options with you.\u00a0\u00a0Please come back and let us know how you're doing...we care.\u00a0\u00a0You are among people who understand!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

For two years i have been coming off them velafluxine cold turkey and slowly just weaned off dolsulipin 2 months ago and still having withdrawal as they alter brain chemistry.Try something natural 5HTP converts to seretonin if taken in the morning or melatonin if taken of a night. Do some exercise yoga, walking, meditation, use lavender and geranium really good for stress. Also take avenus sativa tincture 20 drops 3 times aday in a little water for anxiety. Go for some counselling fight it be kind to yourself and slowly you will get through this !!LoveLorraine xx",
