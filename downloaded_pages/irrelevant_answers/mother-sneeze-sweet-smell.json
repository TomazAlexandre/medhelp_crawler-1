            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The constant sneezing, and nasal congestion, with altered smell could be due to vasomotor rhinitis, in which the symptoms occur in response to a trigger, like eating spicy food or going outside in the cold. If there is a superadded infection, it could further alter the smell.\u00a0\u00a0The primary treatment is simply avoiding the things that trigger her symptoms. It is often treated with a drying nasal spray (like Atrovent) and antihistamines like chlopheneramine and lovatidine are effective. Nasal decongestant drops too relieve congestion. Please discuss this with your doctor am sure he will provide further assistance.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am asking this on behalf of my mother.She is forty one years old,perfectly healthy and physically fit.When she sneezes,a very sweet,musky smell is emitted.It can be described as flowery or honey like or cinnamon like.Its not bad at all.The smell is strong and lingers for a bit,and can be smelled from several feet away also.Its not genetic because no one else in her family has this.Some experts say that tonsils,sinusitis or diabetes could cause this but my mother does not suffer from any of these conditions.Just to let you know,my mother has\u00a0\u00a0a wet sneeze,with a lot of mist and spray emitted in it.Thanks.",
