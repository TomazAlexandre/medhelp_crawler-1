Doxil gave me 13 months of remssion and was fairly easy to tolerate for me.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck~~~Joanne",

            "answer": "I just finished with Doxil ---- they did a MUGA scan of my heart before my chemo and midway through to make sure my heart was ok -- I don't know how diabetes factors in -- just stay hydrated and stay away from hot showers,baths, and tight clothes and shoes --- they won't give you the Doxil if they think there is too much risk with your heart -- I did not end up in remission but have such a small amount of cancer left they are treating me with arimidex hoping it will stay stable so I can get a chemo breakGood luck with itJeanne",

            "answer": "Go to the Doxil website for more tips and suggestions. I would suggest you ice your feet the night before your Doxil treatment and the ENTIRE time you are receiving the dose the next day. Sip on cold, iced drinks during the infusion as well. Watch your hands and feet for hand/foot syndrome which can be painful rashes and blisters. Take COQ10 supplements for your heart. Best of luck to you, Deandra",

You really should go to Doxil.com and call their support line (I think it's an 877 number) They will send you ice packs and info and stuff --- stay hydrated and moisturize -- it will also help the skin.Jeanne",
