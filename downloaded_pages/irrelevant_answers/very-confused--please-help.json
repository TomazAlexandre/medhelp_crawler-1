            "answer": "\"He wants me to come back in in a month and drink this stuff and then test me again.\"It would help to answer your question if I knew what this stuff was and what the test you mention is? Glucose or what? There's too many ifs in your post to give you a clear answer so here's some links that will help you understand diabetes better;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/diabetes.htmlhttp://diabetes.webmd.com/default.htmhttp://www.emedicinehealth.com/diabetes/article_em.htm",

            "answer": "you had low blood sugar readings and often someone who has low blood sugar readings for awhile can indeed show up as a diabetic a few years down the road, I know as it also happned to me, first I kept having low blood sugar readings feeling dizzy and sweating ,had to eat something every few hours to keep it normal, and ten years later I developed full blown diabetes, the test your doctor wants you to take is to find out if you are diabetic or pre diabetic, they give you a sugary drink then a certain number of hours later check your blood sugar. good luck. a fasting blood sugar of 125 could well be prediabetic or even diabetic, they lowered the normal fasting blood sugar from 125 to 100",

    "question": "Ok, I'm really confused about all of this. I went to the Dr. the other day and had this episode of dizziness, sweating and feeling sick to my stomach. It hit me out of the blue. Luckily my Dr. was right there and checked my blood sugar. I had eaten very little that day.\u00a0\u00a0It was at 65. He gave me some oj and then checked it again and it was at 74.\u00a0\u00a0He looked in my file and noticed that a week earlier I had my blood sugar checked twice. On a full stomach it was at 100, then fasting for 9 hours it was 125. What does this mean? He wants me to come back in in a month and drink this stuff and then test me again. He told me that now there is a really good chance of developing diabetes within the next 10 years. I don't really understand anything about diabetes. I thought that with diabetes you have either high or low blood sugar, not both. Can somebody please help me understand this?",
