            "answer": "What are the reference ranges for the T3 and T4?\u00a0\u00a0Reference ranges vary from lab to lab and have to come from your own report.\u00a0\u00a0Also, were they Free T3 and Free T4 or were they Total T3 and Total T4?\u00a0\u00a0Those aren't the same tests as the Free's and don't give the same information.Your TSH definitely indicates hypothyroidism, and you T3 and T4 seem to be very low in the ranges, as we normally see them, though we can't know for sure until we see the ranges from your lab report... these, too, would indicate hypo.While some symptoms of hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism can be the same, your symptoms of weight loss, sweating, etc may be caused by something else.\u00a0\u00a0Have you been tested for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Those are some of the symptoms my son had prior to his type I diabetes diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0He was, and still is, very thin, but it's nothing to do with his thyroid.",

            "answer": "OK whats your new T3, T4 and TSH after taking thyronorm 50 mcg for 2 months?From your previous result it indicates subclinical hypothyroidism which can give mixed symptoms from both hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism.So based on symptoms alone its hard to tell. Please post new results along with reference range mentioned in that paper.",

    "question": "Hello! i am 21 and i did my blood and urinal test for T3,T4 and TSH which came to be 104.20, 8.0 and 9.23 respectively. I did that again after a week from another lab and got 118,7.54 and 11.710. The doctor said i had some thyroid problem and gave me Thyronorm 50mcg. Its been 2 months but nothing has changed much in me. After some browsing i found elevated TSH means hypothyroidism but the symptoms of hyperthyroidism match me perfectly i.e excessive sweating, underweight and loss of weight, loss of hair, trouble sleeping. How is this possible? And what should i do to get back to normal and start gaining weight. I tried every means to put on some weight like gym, supplements etc. And yes i do eat a lot than my other chubby friends. Please help me with this and if possible tell me any food chart to follow to gain weight as fast as possible.",
