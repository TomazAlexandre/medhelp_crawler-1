            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Possible complications of the surgery for retinal detachment include double vision (diplopia), elevated pressure in the eye (glaucoma), bleeding into the vitreous within the retina or behind the retina, clouding of the lens of the eye (cataract), or drooping of the eyelid (ptosis). Cataract surgery will definitely help when there is clouding of the lens. Discuss the operation with your doctor to ease any worries. Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hi,Although most cataracts are related to aging, other types of cataract such as secondary cataract, traumatic cataract, and congenital cataract are also present. Cataracts can form after surgery for other eye problems and can develop in people who have other health problems, such as diabetes. It is also linked to steroid use and previous eye injury. Cataract removal is one of the safest and most effective types of surgery. Take care always and do keep us posted.",
