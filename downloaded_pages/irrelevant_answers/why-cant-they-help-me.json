    "question": "I am 41 almost 42 and have been diabetic for the past 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0Up until 3 years ago my diabetes was under control but has steadily gotten worse and is now out of control.I take glipizide, metformin at their max dose and januvia (a newbie med).\u00a0\u00a0My diabetes is still out of control.\u00a0\u00a0my weight does not change.\u00a0\u00a0I eat no refined sugars.In the last 18 mos my digestion has changed so dramatically that I can eat nothing but bland foods (mostly cereals).\u00a0\u00a0I eat shredded wheat or malt o meal for 90 % of my meals because anything else gives me profuse diarheah.\u00a0\u00a0I am so tired all the time that it takes everything I have to get up and go.\u00a0\u00a0Then once I get up doing the most menial task wears me out for the day.\u00a0\u00a0I have headaches but would not consider them chronic.In the last 3 mos I have started having low grade fevers and my labs which have always been normal now show increased liver values?????\u00a0\u00a0my urination is fine and not painful, my bowels are 4 to 10 times per day (but have been for several years).\u00a0\u00a0I have the chronic feeling of having swallowed a rock and have upper abdominal discomfort but not pain.\u00a0\u00a0But my main complaint is that I am so exhausted all the time!My doctor does not address my symptoms at all, he just keep thinking that if my diabetes comes under control that the other problems will as well.\u00a0\u00a0I am sick of this--I think that my diabetes out of control is a symptom of another problem and that if he would JUST look for the other problem and treat it, my diabetes would come under control.Please--any suggestions.",
