Pancreatic Cancer may present with upper abdominal pain that may radiate to the back, yellowing of skin and the whites of\u00a0\u00a0the eyes, loss of appetite, weight loss, depression and blood clots. It is good that the initial CT scan was normal. It is important that you discuss the results with your attending physician for proper evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0Additional diagnostic tests such as endoscopic ultrasound\u00a0\u00a0or endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) may be indicated. Take care and do keep us posted.",
