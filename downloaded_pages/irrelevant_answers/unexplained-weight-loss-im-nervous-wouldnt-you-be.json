            "answer": "What part hurts when you eat?\u00a0\u00a0Have you been checked for diabetes too? Did they do the full thyroid bloodwork on you?\u00a0\u00a0Many times when tested for thyroid disfunctions people get the cheaper test done and there are many false results. What looks to be normal on one test shows up abnormal on the expensive test.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your doctor if you got the more thorough test done w/ t3,t4 tsh & all that. Don't be affraid to go to the hospital, there maybe many tests done but mainly they want to be able to give you nutritian by way of IV. Just bring some favorite reading material or music w/earplugs and enough battery power, playing cards or a handheld game (that the sound can be shut off on)you don't want to disturb any neighbors. Put in all in a lockable case for safety when you're not in the room. Hospitals don't want to be liable for \"misplaced\" personal items. Pray your way through any scarey stuff and enjoy the peace that comes over you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and fast healing.",
