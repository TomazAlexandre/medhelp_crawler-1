            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since the vertigo is persisting then get a complete ENT evaluation. Other causes such as anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems should be ruled out. Endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling. Spinal nerve compression in cervical spine region too should be looked at as a cause of vertigo.You should definitely get this investigated. Regarding MRI and further tests you can take a second opinion. You should not wait a year and just let it be. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi There,My daughter had a similar event a year ago. She is in a holding pattern. Many people have these lesions on their brain.They are referred to as areas of demylination. One episode and they can not call it MS. I guess you could call it pre-MS. She too had been under alot of stress and I firmly believe that is what brought on her condition. Virus can cause this too. possibly your vertigo was viral induced and the lesions were incidental findings. If your vertigo resolves, I would let go of the event and try to eliminate your stress-nothing good comes of it.\u00a0\u00a0If your symptoms of vertigo do not go away then by all means pursue another 2nd opinion from a reputable neurologist. My daughter does yearly MRI's unless symptoms return. do you have any other symptoms? Numbness? Tingling? Unsteady? blurred vision?",

    "question": "About 3 months ago I had a sudden onset of severe Vertigo.\u00a0\u00a0When they performed the MRI they found legions on my brain, some in the area where MS lesions would be and one that is larger than the others. They did perform a visual, auditory and electrod tests and various blood work which everything came back as normal. I did speak to a neurologist specialist for MS, he said he could not rule it in or out because I have no other symptoms of MS. I do have a very stressful life like everyone else I am constantly on the go and care for my mother with alzheimers and 2 of my grandchildren plus work 40 hour weeks. No one can tell me what this is. At first they said it was MS or a stroke (ruled out), then Lime Disease (ruled out), inner ear infection (ruled out) now back to maybe MS. They don't want me to come back for 1 year to do another MRI unless I have another onset of vertigo, which left me completley incapaciated for a week plus. My family doctor was iriatated because I went to the hospital and neurology got involved. At this point I am not sure what to do. Should I just let it go and wait to see if anything else happens, or should a seek another opinion? They did tell me the lesions were not cancerous.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
