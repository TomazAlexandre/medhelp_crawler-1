            "answer": "It is true antibiotics can cause thrush for some people. But I am curious if your partner was treated for the yeast infection because if he wasn't then you will simply keep passing it back and forth to each other. You both need to be treated at the same time, and wait until you are both clear before resuming sexual intercourse.",

            "answer": "You have been through the ringer with things that increase the likelihood of yeast.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry you've had such a rough time!\u00a0\u00a0Agree with above that yeast can be passed between partners.\u00a0\u00a0If you had sex while having a yeast infection, your partner could pick it up then and pass it back to you.\u00a0\u00a0Do not have sex right now without a condom and talk to him about that.I had a nasty yeast infection after antibiotics a couple of months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Ugh, feel for you.\u00a0\u00a0They are so uncomfortable!\u00a0\u00a0I did use the monostat one day (diflucan is better in my opinion!!)\u00a0\u00a0but I also ate probiotic yogurt (activia).\u00a0\u00a0I swear the yogurt helped.\u00a0\u00a0I was cleared up pretty quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Monostat doesn't work as fast as diflucan, I had discharge for about 5 days after it but between that the yogurt, cotton underwear changed often, it went away.Talk to your partner, use condoms, eat the Activia and hope it goes completely away.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",

            "answer": "Some women can be more prone to resistant yeast infections than others. It sounds like this has not been going on for very long so I would not get too worried just yet.If you truly had just a \"bad cold\" you should not have been given antibiotics. I hear this happening all the time and over prescribing of antibiotics is why we have so many antibiotic resistant bacteria (superbugs) in the U.S. (as well as women with yeast infections!).If this yeast infection continues to recur, boric acid suppositories may be warranted.Keep us posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "So, this all started with a yeast infection.I had some pretty typical symptoms, went to the doc, who diagnosed by my description of symptoms. Did a urine test for STDs (chlamydia, gonnehrea) all negative. He prescribed Diflucan and gave me 2 pills. I took the first one and the symptoms got a lot better. Then (my thought is it wasn't fully healed) after sex it returned. So I took another Diflucan, everything seemed cool.Then I got a really bad cold and was prescribed a Z pack. Surprise! Yeast was back. So I went to the doctor and this time they did a \"wet mount\" turns out I had BV and Yeast together. Who knew they co-existed. I was prescribed 7 days of Flagyl followed by, you guessed it, more Diflucan.After the Flagyl, I think the BV is at bay as I haven't had symptoms. Took the Diflucan after the last dose (24 hours after) and I do see an improvement in my symptoms, but the discharge isn't gone. I took it Saturday night and it's now Tues.Is this a recurrent yeast infection or did I just have the one and aggrevate it with antibiotics? I'm nervous when I google this because it keeps saying my immune system could be compromised... This is only the second yeast infection I've ever had in my life and I'm in my mid 30s.Is it typical for this to be so hard to treat? Is it really a symptom of HIV or Diabetes? Or just a stubborn infection that needs time and more meds to go away.I'm now 3 diflucan in. I'm taking billions of probiotics, eating yogurt, juicing, taking vitamins... Pretty much everything you can imagine. Dr.'s appt next week.Should I be nervous?",
