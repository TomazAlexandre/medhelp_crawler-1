            "answer": "If it's gluten, she'll have both good and bad days and it could take weeks-to-months before you'll really know. But overall she should see good progress. If you finally determine that it seems to be gluten issues, then get a test to check her genes. If it turns out to be 'auto-immune' and celiac - not just a sensitivity - she'll have to make very sure she doesn't get hit by hidden gluten and also have any of your children checked for celiac issues. Also check to see if she cross-reacts to casein, the major protein in diary. Many celiacs do cross-react and the symptoms will continue.",

            "answer": "I have type 1 diabetes and Celiac. They are both linked to each other it has been studied that having celiac can trigger type 1 diabetes. Well, I am 26 and I have been suffering through chronic pain all throughout my body ver since I was 22 and had my daughter. I believe it is due to both ailments. The pain is serious and there is no way to determine where it comes from and I have basically given up and rely on pain medication to get through the nerve pain. I wish you both the best and hope that she is negative for either and that she gets through the pain, because I know how depressing it can be. Make sure to life her spirits up, try doing soemthing nice that doesn't involve bringing up how her pain feels. It is hard FEELING and THINKING about the pain.. so get her mind off it sometimes. =) best of wishes to you both!",
