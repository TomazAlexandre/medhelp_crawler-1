            "answer": "Ya sorry @super_sally888, she also has really high TSH value but low T3 and T4 as what they should be, i was thinking to ask the question about them but sugar got over me.Injecting insulin reducing the level a bit to about 350-400.She has been using thyroxen 50mg according to what the doctor has suggested but TSH is still at 75 which was 81 3 months back. Don't know what should we do.:(",

            "answer": "Is TSH the only thyroid test being done?\u00a0\u00a0Your mother needs to have Free T3 and Free T4, along with the TSH, as TSH is totally inadequate as a diagnostic and treatment aid, by itself.\u00a0\u00a0Free T3 is the most important because it correlates best with symptoms.If other tests have been done, please post the results and the reference ranges, which vary from lab to lab, so must come from her own lab report.It sounds as though the treatment for both your mother's thyroid and blood sugar is totally\u00a0\u00a0inadequate.\u00a0\u00a0Even at 350-400 her blood sugar is WAY too high.",

            "answer": "If her TSH is 75 then she is sadly very hypothyroid and needs an increase in medication.\u00a0\u00a0Probably up to 100 mcg, and then she should be retested in 6 weeks and maybe readjusted further.\u00a0\u00a0She should also have the FT3 and FT4 tested.Uncontrolled thyorid will definitely impact on blood sugar controls.The insulin is definitely not enough with her sugars at 350 - 400 and there are risk of very serious complications.If her doctor is not taking this seriously and addressing it agressively you need a new doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Read up on diabetes (she needs to be on a consistent low carb diet), and her insulin needs to be increased to bring her sugars down.",

Let me tell you the values, T3 is 42 when it needs to be in-between 84-172 and T4 is 3.7 and it ranges from 4.5-12.5.Yeah, we have changed the doctor last night and now she will take 3 tablets of thyroxin 50mg and will be retested after 6 weeks.",

    "question": "Hello people, hope you all be fine.My mother is suffering from high blood sugar, it was 600+ a couple of days before. Doctor asked us to inject insulin, 26 (units in morning), 26(At noon), and 24(Before sleep), but that's not working. Sugar level is still averages between 470-520. That's a big concern for us, what should we do now to get normal values.?",
