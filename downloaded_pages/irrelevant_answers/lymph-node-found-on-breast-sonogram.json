            "answer": "Yes Lymph Modes can be seen on scans especially on Mammograms which i think you should have even though you're young, cos they're very accurate and it's not fair that young woman can't have one unless it's completely nessicery. I'm not sure about Ultrasound's. And Lymph Nodes can be felt around your armpit cos theres alot there, i can feel them, but i am very slim. Yes Lymph Nodes can turn into cancer especially the one's near your breasts. I know this from watching a programme all about it. But if the specialists have said everything's fine then i'm sure it is, they know what they're looking for. If you're still concerned talk to your Doctor and make him/her listen to you. x",

    "question": "I am in my mid 20's and recently lost over 100 pounds. I found a lump in my right breast near my arm pit. (there are no cases on breast cancer anywhere in my family).\u00a0\u00a0 I went to my OB who sent me to get a breast ultrasound done.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a general surgeon who said that the results said probable benign but a reeval in 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0I then went to breast specialist who said she was not sure what it was but felt like nothing to worry about beucase it is small, palpable and mobile.\u00a0\u00a0I told her my husband and I want to start a family so she said just to rule out any concerns, she sent me to have another sonogram done and if it looked like a concern to the radiologist then they would do a biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0At the second songram I took my old films (about 2 - 3 weeks had passed) with me.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse told me that it looked like a lymph node but she would do another scan just to make sure.\u00a0\u00a0Well, she said that again it looked like a node...the radiologist verified and sent me on my way.\u00a0\u00a0I got a letter from the hospital telling me that the results were normal and to have\u00a0\u00a0baseline mamo in 10 years. My breast specialsit followed up with a call to me and said that she did not need to see me unless I had any other problems.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are:1.\u00a0\u00a0Could the weight loss contribute to the lymph node being palpable?2.\u00a0\u00a0Is it normal for a lymph node to be felt and saw on the scans?3.\u00a0\u00a0Can a lymph node ever turn into cancer...is this something I should be concerned about?4. I am assuming that it will always be there beucase it is a part of me...is this a correct assumption?Thanks!",
