            "answer": "Hi,How are you?The symptom of burning sensation in the index finger raises the suspicion of nerve compression. The most common condition is carpal tunnel syndrome which occurs due to compression of median nerve at the level of the wrist joint.Other cause that needs to be excluded is diabetes. I would suggest you to consult your family doctor about it.Take care!",

    "question": "This happened to me three times yesterday. The sensation of having touched something hot in my finger. The first time it happend I was removing a piece of cheese from the refrigerator. The cheese was cold and my other fiingers felt the cold and my index finger felt the cheese as hot. The second time that I happened, I had nothing in my hand and I had the sensation that my finger was being burned, as if I had touched a hot pan on a stove. The third time it happened I was touching another person on the shoulder and once again the sensation that I was touching something hot.What kind of doctor should I see about this? I have not been to a doctor in more than a year. I am a 46 year old male and I do not take any medications.",
