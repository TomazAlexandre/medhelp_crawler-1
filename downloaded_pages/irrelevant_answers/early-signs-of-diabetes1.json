    "question": "My glucose level was 103\u00a0\u00a0in February 2011 without fasting which was within the range of 85-120. May 30 2011 I ended up in the ER due to a gallbladder attack.\u00a0\u00a0My glucose level was 115 which was high since the range used was 65-99. A week later the surgeon repeated the tests to prepare me for surgery. The glucose level was 86 which was normal since the range used was 65-99. Three days ago my blood was drawn an hour or less after eating. The results once again read the glucose level of 115 which was high since the range used was 65-99. No one in my family has diabetes. I will see my pcp in a few days.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be concerned?",
