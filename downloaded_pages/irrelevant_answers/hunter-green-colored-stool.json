    "question": "Hoping someone can offer some advice.\u00a0\u00a0My boyfriend called me into the bathroom this evening to show me a disturbing sight of hunter-green colored stool! The water was completely green and it was nothing like i've ever seen.\u00a0\u00a0I asked him if he felt well and of course he looked more worried to tell me the truth than anything.\u00a0\u00a0I asked him how long this had been happening and he said it happened yesterday as well.I do want to add that he is diabetic and does not do very good in taking care of his disease.\u00a0\u00a0He continues to eat what he wants, doesnt take his blood sugar and takes his insulin injection whenever he's feeling bad or if he wants to eat something sweet.\u00a0\u00a0It's been a little over one year since he's been diagnosed with diabetes and he's also loosing weight but blood sugar is still elevated.I am afraid his kidneys are shutting down and I told him to go to the ER right away but he just dismissed it and said it was something that maybe i prepared...that is incorrect because today when he told me he had the same movement yesterday, i had not prepared any food at home.Please help or direct me to where i can find some specific info...I've searched everywhere!",
