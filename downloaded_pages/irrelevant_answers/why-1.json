            "answer": "I agree with Vincent and Xhost. After my incident it was like all of a sudden everyone began talking about HIV. I realize they were always talking about it, the difference was that before (as far as I was concerned) it never applied to me,so I didn't pay it as much attention. I was always afraid of it, but after having a real scare, it became as if all talk of HIV or persons infected with it were directed at or included me. In a way its openned my eyes to the insensitivity I had toward the disease and its victims before. There was no personal attachment. Now I sympathize more and see how it can really effect even the most innocent people. And my own fears about the potential impact on my family have made me more aware, not of just the victims but their families. I even found myself being concerned about the impact it may have on the person who possbily infected me if my test comes back positive and I have to tell her that she is positive. I really don't know how I would do that.... I hope I won't have to.",
