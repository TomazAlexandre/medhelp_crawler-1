            "answer": "congrats on the girl.. how fun!\u00a0\u00a0Sugar in urine is normal for pregnant women, especially after a meal. However, if you constantly have it your dr. will probably do a glucose tolerance on you. They usually run it around 27-30 weeks. Protein is normal in trace amounts as well, but if you have swelling, big increase in BP and pain in the abdomen along with it, it could be a sign of pre-eclampsia. That needs to be checked out soon. Just a little insight from what I know working in the lab, and being gd pos myself. Hope it helps!",

    "question": "*******Its a little girl!!!! ********I had my appointment today, I'm 25w & 5d, my gyno checked 3 times to see that he could see a \"race track\" (his description) and yep there it was, he said that hes 95% sure, I had a feeling that it was going to be a girl and I am just so excited, my fiance is excited too, as much as he wanted a boy he is just as excited to know its a girl, now I can start referring to her as a she and her instead of \"it\".Also I had my routine pee test and they found sugar in my pee, he said that it is completely normal and all pregnant women have sugar in their pee but is it normal to have it there at 25 weeks? and if it doesn't go away and does turn into diabetes is it managable and curable? and is having too much protien in your urine the same as sugar in your urine? and what causes it, is it from eating too much sugary foods? I know I should have asked my gyno all these questions but as soon as I go in for my apointments my mind just goes blank and it isn't till afterwards that I think of all these questions that I could have asked.Thank you!!!!!!",
