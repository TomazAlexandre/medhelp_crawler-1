            "answer": "Hi,I would suggest you to get your blood sugar levels checked to rule out diabetes. Excessive hunger and increased frequency of urination are some of the early symptoms of diabetes.If you suspect anemia it is important to get Iron levels checked and increase the consumption of Iron rich foods like green leafy vegetables.Excessive stress and anxiety can also cause symptom of being hungry all the time.I would suggest you to consult your GP and discuss all these possibilities with him.Thanks",

            "answer": "Thanks for you suggestions, but what about the headache? That is what is most persistent right now... I wake up every morning with an ache that spreads from my nose to the back of my ears and my head feels like it's filled with rocks. I thought that maybe it's how I'm sleeping and on what kind of mattress, but it seems no matter where I sleep or for how long, my head still hurts all day. What do you think about this?I am always hungry too, which i guess could be a diabetes symptom, but I most definitely am not losing weight (haha, I have been trying..). Could it still be diabetes?Thanks!",

            "answer": "Hi,High and low blood sugar can cause headaches. Low blood sugar levels in the early morning are a frequent cause of headaches. Other possibilities include sinusitis, TMJ or tempormandibular joint disorder and allergies. Sleep apnea can also cause headaches in the morning. This is common in people who snore at night. Diabetes is common in obese people and if the disease is just starting there maynot be any weight loss.Your symptoms warrant a clinical exam by your GP.Thanks",

    "question": "I have had a headache for it seems like forever. It isn't too painful, more of a dull ache like about 10 books are sitting on my head. I also get very dizzy, like I haven't slept in days, but I am sleeping fine.I think I drink enough water, and increased water consumption just makes me pee more, it doesn't really do anything about my headache.I have been tested before for vitamin deficiency but nothing came up, though maybe I need to take iron supplements?I also feel hungry all the time, even though I eat like crazy. Am I missing something? I am also vegetarian.Thanks for the helpRobin",
