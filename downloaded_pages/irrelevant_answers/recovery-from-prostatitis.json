            "answer": "Prostatitis is certainly a possibility - and sometimes require an extended course of antibiotics (sometimes lasting 4-12 weeks)I would repeat a physical exam to determine if tenderness is still there.\u00a0\u00a0Urinalysis and culture should also be done.\u00a0\u00a0If there continues to be concern about prostatitis, prostatic fluid can be expressed and sent.A transrectal ultrasound can be considered to image the prostate for any abscesses.\u00a0\u00a0If this is the case, then antibiotics would not be helpful, and draining of the abscess would be needed.These options should be discussed with your urologist.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

            "answer": "I was given cipro after I was diagnosed with what we thought was uretitis. I felt a lot better and my urine no longer burned. However, after masturbating, the burning urine returned.\u00a0\u00a0I got my prostate checked, and it was very tender. Now I was given that Sulfa what-you-call it antibiotic for 14 days.\u00a0\u00a0I feel a lot better, but now I\"m afraid to masturbate, for fear that pain might come back.\u00a0\u00a0At what point do I know it's safe to masturbate again?Also, this all began after having unprotected fellatio with a woman. I've been checked for gonorhea, syphllis, chylamidia, HIV, mono, HPV, and diabetes. All were negative.\u00a0\u00a0I have narrowed down the possiblities to Amebiasis or intestinal paristies, which the CDC says can be transferred in this manner.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to make sense, since I have two of the symptoms of amebiasis: itchy wet stools and constant fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0What do you think?",

    "question": "3 weeks ago I was having difficulties urinating, achieving an erection, and severe discomfort upon ejaculation. I had all of the classic symptoms for prostatitis. I went to the doctor on Monday the 25th and there was trace amounts of blood in my urine and my prostate was enlarged (the exam was quite uncomfortable). I was prescribed a 1 week course of Cipro. By Wednesday I was urinating much easier. By Sunday I was achieving erections (full, hard, lasting while fantasizing about sexual situations, no attempts at masturbation).This week I attempted to have intercourse on Tuesday. I was only able to get semi-erect. (Though while fantasizing prior to attempts at intercourse, I got fully erect). When I ejaculated, it wasn't too uncomfortable.We attempted to have intercourse again last night. I couldn't achieve any manner of an erection. During fantasizing later though, I did, though couldn't attempt to masturbate because of our full house.So, today, I finally have an empty house and attempt to masturbate. I empty my bladder before hand, but there seems to be a bit of strange fluid at the end (almost like pre-***?), and my bladder felt a bit... tingly. I then couldn't achieve erection as I attempted to arouse myself, and eventually had an orgasm as I stroked my flacid penis. Semen was ejactulated, and it seemed to be the normal amount that I usually ejactulate. The orgasm didn't feel very good and made me feel like I had to urinate IMMEDIATELY and URGENTLY. I sat down and attempted to urinate and the feeling went away after awhile.My doctor is on vacation today and won't return until Monday.What's going on here? Is this just all stuff that's going to get better on its own soon?",
