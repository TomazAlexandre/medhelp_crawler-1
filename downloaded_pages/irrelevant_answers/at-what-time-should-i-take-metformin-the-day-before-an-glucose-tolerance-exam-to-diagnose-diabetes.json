            "answer": "The thing is that my doctor is measuring my glucose control with medication and medication effectiveness. What I want is to know what my real numbers are without the aid of the medication.This, because I\u00b4ve noticed that the past week I\u00b4ve been getting glucose numbers around 70 two hours after meals (with medication). Since they are fine or low, could that mean I do not need the medication?",

            "answer": "Metformin has an elimination half-life of approximately 17.6 hours. It is not metabolized, but secreted in the urine.It takes approximately 5.5 x elimination half life's for a medicine to be cleared from your system, therefore it'll be in your system for that long.So Metformin will be in your system for 96.8 hours i.e. 4 days (5.5 x 17.6 hours).http://www.drugs.com/answers/how-long-does-glucophage-metformin-stay-in-system-269979.htmlIf censored the web site is drugs dhot comYou must first call your doctor and inform him/her of your intentions to halt Metformin to test you glucose \"clean\". Stopping without doing so is inadvisable.I will comment on insulin testing in your other post.",

Metformin is cleared from system in 4 days.What I don\u00b4t understand is how many hours before should I take metformin for it not to effect/vary my blood tests results?Should I stop taking it 17,6 hours before, or stop taking it 4 days before.The fact that metformin stays in system for 4 days, does that mean that metformin is still effective????",

            "answer": "Metformin will be in your system for 96.8 hours i.e. 4 days (5.5 x 17.6 hours). Stop taking it 4 days before only with doctors consent.\"The fact that metformin stays in system for 4 days, does that mean that metformin is still effective????\"As you'll see below, 90% is eliminated during the first 24 hrs, the remaining 10% takes up to 4 days to flush from your system. Talk to your pharmacist about its lifespan effectiveness after 24 hrs.Following oral administration, approximately 90% of the absorbed drug is eliminated via the renal route within the first 24 hours, with a plasma elimination half-life of approximately 6.2 hours. In blood, the elimination half life is approximately 17.6 hours, suggesting that the erythrocyte mass may be a compartment of distribution.",

    "question": "A year ago my sugar and insulin numbers where too high. My doctor prescribed metformin and told me my numbers should improve if I lost the weight (I was overweight at that time). I lost all the weight and I want to do the \u201cglucose tolerance test\u201d again to confirm or discard the possibility of having diabetes. At what time should I take the metformin the day before the test? How long does metformin stay in your body?? I do not want metformin to mask/change my glucose/insulin numbers.THE TOLERANCE TEST I AM DOING IS FOR DIAGNOSING DIABETES, NOT TO MEASURE METFORMIN (MEDICATION) EFFECTIVENESS",
