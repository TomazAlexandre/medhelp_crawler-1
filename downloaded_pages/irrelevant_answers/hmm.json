            "answer": "My highest number was 132 and I was still diagnosed as diabetic. I claimed to be borderline and my doctor said there is no such thing. And she was right. I'm 39w 5d and my baby is 8 lb 5oz according to ultrasound. I never felt diabetic until later and when checking my sugars 4 times a day they will jump up if I'm not careful. (Jumping to about 150 is really high for me). So I'm still not on the extreme end and i still ended up with too much amniotic fluid because of the diabetes. If they won't treat you as diabetic you can always just be conscious of it and count your carbs and watch your sugary food. Stay active. It's a healthy way to be pregnant anyways. :)",
