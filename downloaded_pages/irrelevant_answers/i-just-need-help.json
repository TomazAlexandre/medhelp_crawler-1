            "answer": "I am a single income career mom who only gets to go to the gym on the weekend for about 45 to 60 minutes but also started writing in this food diary and watch what I ate. I also cannot afford any portion of my budget to any weight programs like Weight Watchers. I started to see the scale go down but then hit a plateau. I finally went to nutrition counseling recently who said to lose weight over 40 pounds I needed to start working out 60 minutes 6 times a week and cut my calories by five hundred. any combination of the two if I couldn't go to the gym I needed to cut more calories or if I started working out at the gym I could eat more calories was the balance. I started to make more time for myself by getting out in the neighborhood with the kids and walking, doing a 25 minute quick jog, or using free weights or cardio videos from On Demand at night.\u00a0\u00a0I'm now starting to see the scale move down again so I hope this helps you out too.",
