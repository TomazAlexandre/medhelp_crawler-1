            "answer": "Hi, it is possible to detect gastroparesis with endoscopy if your doctor has done additional tests. Another way to study is with a gastric-emptying study, which measures how long it takes for food to move through your stomach. In gastroparesis, the muscles in the wall of your stomach work poorly or not at all. This prevents your stomach from emptying properly. Gastroparesis can\u00a0interfere with digestion, cause nausea vomiting and cause problems with blood sugar levels and nutrition. Diabetes can cause gastroparesis, please check with your doctor to rule out this condition. Regards.",
