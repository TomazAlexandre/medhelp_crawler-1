    "question": "I am 36 YO. I am 2 years post hysterectomy. Since having my hysterectomy I have recurrent yeast infections (which has been verified via gyno) Before my hysterectomy I had 2 yeast infections my whole life.\u00a0\u00a0From what I've read it seems to be a common issue among women who've had a hysterectomy.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I'm curious as to what the causes could be. I had read that the ovaries stop functioning properly more quickly after a hysterectomy and he said no. He also recommended douching with baking soda. (I've never been a doucher)\u00a0\u00a0I suppose it would make sense to do since I no longer have periods to flush that area? I'm also chronically fatigued, so thinking I need to get tested for diabetes. (these would be the only two symptoms of diabetes I think I've got) Would having the hysterectomy make symptoms of diabetes more noticeable?",
