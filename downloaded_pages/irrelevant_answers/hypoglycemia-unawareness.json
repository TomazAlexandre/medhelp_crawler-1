            "answer": "I agree with Kevin... sounds like a sudden drop in blood sugar ...or maybe a slow one... how involved in that video game did you get?\u00a0\u00a0If you get really distracted by a project or task for a few hours, especially if sitting / not moving around, you might not notice the symptoms for a while.\u00a0\u00a0Especially if you haven't eaten in a while...Just remember that it's important to stick to a schedule of eating (preferably small meals every few hours) to keep your blood sugars in control.\u00a0\u00a0Also, it's a little unusual for Type 2 diabetics to \"go hypo\" and it's usually caused by the meds taken to control blood glucose; so if you are on meds, your eating schedule is even more important.Just as general info, in Type 2 diabetics, alcohol can also cause hypoglycemic episodes and then cause rebound high sugars that can take days to get back under control, so be cautious about that, too.Overall, it's a good idea to always have some sugar source with you at all times (a piece of hard candy or an energy bar) just in case...\u00a0\u00a0And yes, if you have more episodes talk to your doc about it and maybe adjusting your meds.",

    "question": "I am a 24-year-old with type 2 diabetes. Tonight while playing a video game I suddenly started to feel warm inside, became nervous and started shaking a bit. I thought it might be my blood sugar and sure enough my meter read mine as 58. I ate some food and got it back up to around 113, and the symptoms went away. Some research leads me to believe I had an episode of hypoglycemia unawareness. Does this sound correct? Should I be worried about this happening again? I usually keep my blood sugar very steady, and am startled and scared by what happened.",
