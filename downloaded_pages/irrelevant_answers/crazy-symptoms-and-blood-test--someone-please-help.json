            "answer": "HiMy wife has had the same issues, the nausea, light headedness and loss of weight plus her mensas was off so we did tests, doctors said they couldn't find anything wrong so we consulted a traditional medicine woman who has had to physically examine my wifes vaginal passage and she noted that the passage was crooked which was why we couldn't conceive, the difference in her period and possibly the other symptoms (after the birth of our 2 boys) so we've been to 2 sessions, third today and last tomorrow and also got some herbal medicine. Sorry I can't give you any technical assistance, just thought to share and will let you know what happens after her \"treatments\"...take care",

            "answer": "Have you had your heart checked out? With women, heart disease has atypical symptoms compared to the traditional chest pain most people think of. Often time they experience ringing in the ears, dizziness, nausea, anziety, fatique, upset stomach, pain in the shoulders and jaws, and excessive sweating. A lot of those particular symptoms can be your blood pressure rising and falling. I would consult with your physician and ask for his or her opinion especially if heart disease runs in your family. Diabetes also increases the risk. Take care of yourself and follow-up with your physician.",
