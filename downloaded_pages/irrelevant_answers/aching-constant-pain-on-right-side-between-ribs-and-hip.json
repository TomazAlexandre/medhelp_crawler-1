    "question": "So over the past few days i been having sever left hip and lower back pain due to a injury in 1999 while in military. I been having trouble setting, standing up strait, and laying down. To me that is normal, but this morning i woke up with a aching feeling on my right side (almost strait down from arm pit) right above my hip bone. It is not a sharp pain but an aching pain with a lite burning. Like the burning you get when you give a muscle a good workout. It is constant and does not increase with with anything i do. I know this may sound odd but it feels more outside then inside. Any ideas?? thank you",
