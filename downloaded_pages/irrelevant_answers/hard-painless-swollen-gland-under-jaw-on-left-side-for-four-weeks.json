            "answer": "Thanks GeezLouise75.\u00a0\u00a0I did consider allergy as I have recently had a wooden burner and have asthma.\u00a0\u00a0I have stopped using it to see if any difference occurred but there have been no changes.\u00a0\u00a0I have also taken piriton to see if this eased the symptoms but still nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I forgot to say that I have lost weight recently as well and have been overly tired, hence the blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0I am so concerned but have the doctor again in a couple of days.\u00a0\u00a0I have a little bit of a sore throat today which has not been there for four weeks, I am not sure whether a gland could swell for four weeks prior to symptoms and still be connected.\u00a0\u00a0I am getting so anxious as I have two little children and am panicking greatly as this appears to be by my submandibular gland and has never swollen before, although my tonsils have frequently done so.",
