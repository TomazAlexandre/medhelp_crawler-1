I just called my dr to see if the blood work was in or when it would be in they said not until Friday.\u00a0\u00a0Today so far has been a good day very little tingling,\u00a0\u00a0It's days like this when I think hey maybe there is nothing wrong at all.\u00a0\u00a0But If it where only that easy.\u00a0\u00a0I uderstand that my journey of being dx has only begun.\u00a0\u00a0It is really enough to drive a person insane I feel so helpless. But I am really glad I have found this website.\u00a0\u00a0I am glad I can talk to people that understand what I am going through.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that we can share this important information.\u00a0\u00a0I try talking to my family and I don't think they fully understand.Thanks.- MarieWhat were you dx with Roxanne MS or Diabetes?",

For about 6+ weeks now I have struggled with daily activities and am finding myself very fatigued, lightheaded/dizzy and basically a general malaise daily. I have had blood work done, a stress test, visited the eye doctor and finally an MRI last Friday. The results came back something like you posted above....a \"non-specific chronic white matter at the right parietal region\". Not really sure what that means and have an appointment scheduled for next Friday with a neurologist.I was originally diagnosed with Vertigo but there seems to be something else going on...I'm a very active 36 yr old white male that plays softball twice a week and golfs once or twice as well, this has really slowed me down and not knowing what is going on can be very tough. Hope things work out for you...i'll check back soon enough.",

    "question": "I was feeling numbness and tingling on the right side of my face R/ hand and R/foot, I went to the ER because I could not handle it anymore.\u00a0\u00a0The Attending Physican, requested an Chest X-ray Imperssion: Negative Examination. Ct Head or Brain w/o contrast Impression Essentially negative Noncontrast ct head. I had an abnormal ECG.\u00a0\u00a0She ordered an MRI of the brain.\u00a0\u00a0Impression 1. Sinusitis, 2. Puntctate areas of increased signal in the white matter. Multiple sclerosis and other demyelinating processes would be a consideration.Findings: were as follows:\u00a0\u00a0There is a mild mucoscla thickening throughtout the partially visualized paranasal sinuses consistant with an element of sinusitis. Ventricles are normal in size, shape and postition. No mass effect, midline shift of hyrocephalus. There are two punctate areas of increased signal in the white matter in the right hemisphere as seen on the FLAR images.\u00a0\u00a0One is just superior and lateral to the right lateral ventricle and the other is lateral to the mid portion of the right lateral ventricle. There are also evident on the T2-wieghed inages but are more conspicious on the FLAR images. Diffusion -weighted images reveal no evidence of the acute ischemic process. No specific abnormality on the T1 images. THe punctate areas of increased signal in the white matter are nonspecific. Multiple sclerosis, however remains a consideration.\u00a0\u00a0There are not uncommon in patients over 50 years of age. In patients under 50 years of age, in the absence of underlying hypertension, diabetes or other small vessel disease, multiple scleriosis would be the most likely etiology.My dr. stated that she was surpised that the ER dr had ordered the MRI, but in my case she was glad it was done.\u00a0\u00a0Should I be scared?I follow up with my Dr. she stated did anthor ECG which came out normal.\u00a0\u00a0She also order me to do a 2 hr gluclose test which I did this morning. She has also referred me to Neurologist for evaluation and treatment.I have been having a lot of diffuclties with my feet and legs and my right hand, Could this just be Diabetes?Also I scheduled an appointment with the Nueorologist however they can not get me in until Nov 20,2007.\u00a0\u00a0What happens until then I continue to have good days and bad days?From what I have provided you with, and your experience can you please advise your opionion, Am I dealing with MS. I am a 30 year hispanic female who is very active and always on the go, and have been really healthy until now I am unable to do much now I am always very tired, it is so hard for me to get out of bed.\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything I can do to get this process speeded up/or can you tell me what and where I go from here?Thank you so much for your time.",
