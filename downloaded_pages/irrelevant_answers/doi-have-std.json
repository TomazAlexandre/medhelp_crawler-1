            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!They do not look like symptoms of HIV. Deviated nasal septum (DNS)\u00a0\u00a0can cause recurrent or persistent upper respiratory infections. This can cause fatigue. Also weight gain could be due to improper diet and inactivity. Rule out hypothyroidism and diabetes too. To be on safe side get a STD panel done. Mouth blisters can be due to vitamin deficiencies too. Try multivitamin pills and regularize your meals and physical activity. Consult an ENT for DNS.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
