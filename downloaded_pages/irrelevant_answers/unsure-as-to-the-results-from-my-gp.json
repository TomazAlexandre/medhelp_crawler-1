            "answer": "Depression, onset of diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and some other very minor ailments, just might explain your symptoms or most of them anyway. Depression is a big issue.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, everything stems from the brain.I would redo test (TSH, FT-4 and FT-3) in 6 weeks from the recent test you posted above to see if they repeat or closely repeat.\u00a0\u00a0I don't recognize your T3 level - could you have put decimal in the wrong place.\u00a0\u00a0However, take care of and treat all your ails above first. When they are stable, then revisit thyroid if thyroid levels warrant and symptoms still prevail.Good Luck!",

            "answer": "Actually I have been on Welbutran for about five weeks and have had little change in mood and energy level. I'm also taking a Multi Vit. just to ensure I get the rest of my daily needs. I have not tried increasing B12, however, one of the effects of Welbutran is the increase of energy, which as of yet I have not seen. I'm hoping that in the next couple of weeks will be able to get into an Endocinologist for the rest of the testing like you were explaining. Thank you for the information it really helped.",

    "question": "I am a 29 year old male and over the last few years I have been slowly been becoming more and more depressed, and as a result I have had a list of medical conditions come about. Over the last two years I have been diagnosed with the onset of diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure and some other very minor ailments. I have not really thought much about these complications until recently. Last month I was hospitalized for depression, before I was released they found a TSH level of .12. As a result I was released and told to see my GP. A second test of my TSH level was still low at .14. After almost a month of testing including more blood tests, uptake and an ultrasound (all have come back negative) the Doctor is still not finding a problem. In fact in my most recent blood test my TSH level was at a normal 2.4, however, the T3 hormone was at 33.4 (I was not told what the good level is).In fear of not understanding some of these symptoms I have done a little research, and have found nothing to point me in a direction as to any problems I may still have. I was wondering if this could be caused by my pituitary gland. Some of the symptoms that I have (may or may not related not sure) are consistently thirsty (I never seem to be hydrated), urinating every 20 to 30 minutes, joint problems (every joint in my body cracks or aches), uncontrollable weight gain but only in my midsection, always exhausted (sleeping a full 6 to 10 hours per night), I have over time lost enjoyment in almost everything, I have trouble getting motivated just to leave my house.My question is are these all related to Depression or is there a larger problem that maybe causing this?",
