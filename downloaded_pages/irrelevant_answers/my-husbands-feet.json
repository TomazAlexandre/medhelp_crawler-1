    "question": "My Husbands feet are all cracked and split on the bottom they are very sore. He wears sneakers with white cotton socks and we have added a Dr. Scholl insert for cushioning because he walks on a concrete floor all day. They are not itchy. When he has his shoes on during the day they don't seem to bother him, it's when he is not wearing his shoes that he starts to feel the pain. We have tried soaking his feet in just plain water, and now he has been soaking them in Johnson's foot soap. And I have also been putting ucerin cream on his feet and nothing seems to be helping.He comes from a family of diabetics and I'm curious if it has anything to do with maybe a circulation problem. I am very concerned. Do you have any suggestions on what we can try? He works long hours right now at work so he hasn't been able to get to his primary care physician. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.Thank You,Starlite",
