            "answer": "You take it around 28wks. They give you a sugar-filled juice that you have to drink in either 5 or 10min (cant remember which). Then in an hr they draw your blood to see if youre handling digesting sugar fine or if theres a chance for gestational diabetes. If you fail they do a 3hr test where they draw blood once an hr. If you fail that,\u00a0\u00a0odds are you have gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0GD can put you at risk for a bigger baby and harder delivery so just lets the medical staff know to keep an eye out for those things :)",
