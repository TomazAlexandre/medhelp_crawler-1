It can be due to excessive consumption of fluids, intake of diuretic fluids like caffeine, chocolate, coffee, tea, soft drinks, hot spicy foods; juices high in acid and alcoholic beverages. It can also occur in diabetes and high doses of vit C and B2.Pls check out if there is any intake of the above said medicines or foods. If the symptoms persist then please get it evaluated from a physician and get ruled out the various medical conditions causing polyuria.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
