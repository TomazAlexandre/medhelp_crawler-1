    "question": "Dear All,Sorry again if the question sounds not too intelligent but i am worried and am looking for advice.I work as a flight attendant and after a flight last weekend I noticed a scratch on my arm which seemed superficial but was red and with tiny blood along it. I was not sure wherefrom it may have come, had no contact with any broken glass, knife or something else, none that i know of, but then i thought we also carry needles from passengers with diabetes etc. I am scared in case a colleague did not dispose a needle correctly from the flight before or close the sharp's box and if that needle scratched my arm as I was doing things in the galley or in the boxes/cannisters.It must have been there at least some minutes after the previous flight arrived.Is there a risk of HIV from such an incident if a leftover needle containing the virus scratched me?Many thanks in advance-very much appreciate it!",
