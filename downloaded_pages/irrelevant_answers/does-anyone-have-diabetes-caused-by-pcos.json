    "question": "Was dx with diabetes in Feb. this year.\u00a0\u00a0It has come from a long line of other illness that lead up to it.\u00a0\u00a0Started with thyroid problems, which lead to PCOS, then insulin resistance (undx so untreated!), and now the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In all the reading I've done this kind does not respond to weight loss, only the removal of the ovaries.\u00a0\u00a0I would be more than happy to do this if I could just find a dr willing to.Does anyone have any information on this and if the weight loss, removal of ovaries, or anything else can help turn it around.\u00a0\u00a0Have lost almost 20lbs and it hasn't affected it in the least.\u00a0\u00a0Am also a lot more active now and it's not helping that much either.Thank you for any help you can give me.",
