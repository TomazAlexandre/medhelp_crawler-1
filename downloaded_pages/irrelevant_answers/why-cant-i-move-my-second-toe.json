It doesn't happen all the time, I just notice it from time to time, especially after wearing flip flops. I wouldn't be surprised if they are the culprit. But, I was wondering if you ever did head to the doctor and discover what was wrong? Any advice to pass along would be much appreciated!Thanks!-Jillian",

    "question": "For the past few weeks I've noticed that my 2nd toe next to the big toe (on my right foot) I lose feeling in it. I'm not sure if it's from working out/running but it has happened a few times after I removed my shoes but also happens at night time before bed. Sometimes if I move my toes a little in the back and forth motion, that 2nd toe will lose feeling and I can't move it anymore. I either have to wait a few seconds or move my toe myself to get it to move again. It's like that toe just gets stuck. I try to wiggle it with the rest of my toes but it doesn't move. Is this normal? Do I need to go see the doctor?",
