            "answer": "I know how you feel. I posted similar question on Tuesday. (if you would like to check it out) I do not know for sure that I have GD, since I only failed the one hour test (over 150, bellow 140 is normal) and took the 3 hour test this morning (horrible) but from whatever I talked to my co-workers (former MDs) and read on line, it does not effect your baby in any other way then your baby may end up being huge because all the suger goes to him/her. That is why the diet/exercise. Also, it may happen that if you do not follow the diet, you have a higher chance of developing diebetes later on in your life, but don't nesessary have to. I am a skinny, active (work out 5x a week-former professional athlete, eat very well) person and still look like I will have it. I am 26 weeks, so I figured that I will be dealing with the next 12+/- weeks somehow. I may cheat a bit during my baby shower and Thanksgiving, but by X-mas, heck, I will only have 2 or so weeks to go, so let it be a big baby. I have had a 10 lbs my first one, I guess and will have a another huge one. LOL",

            "answer": "Hi. I know exactly what your dealing with, i have g/d since i was 12 wks. So i've been going thru it for about 7 wks. It's not to terribly bad. Stay away from sugar, and carbs like the previous posters said. The carbs count, they turn into sugar. Also when you eat, eat small portions, eating more of the vegetables during meals. The dietitian will give u a chart to go by, that's what my ob did. I just follow that, and i've actually lost 8 lbs my last visit and the next had only gained 1lb. So i expect to only gain a lil while i'm pregnant too, that's the good side! ;P",

So it looks like I will gain just as much for this baby with 11 more wks to go. It doesn't look like I will have a huge baby thank goodness.\u00a0\u00a0My dad's side of the family have diabetes which they develop later in life so I guess I should deal with the healthy choices now instead of later.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad that I will meet with the dietician because I really need some guidance on my eating habits.",

Mine did and she set me up on a special Meal Plan telling me how many Carbs, Fats and Protiens I can have for meals, snacks, etc. The smallest amount of carbs you should have is at Breakfast time.\u00a0\u00a0Fruits and Milk should be avoiding during the AM if you have GD because they convert immediately to sugar.",

I asked my doc to test me when I was only 12 weeks and she said that they test at 28wks. And now when i took my first GD test my doc told me that it was higher than normal-152. So I had to test again and i didnt get the results from my 3 hr tolerance test yet. I constantly worry about it. Is there any way to find out now if i was diabetic before pregnancy or not?Thank you",
