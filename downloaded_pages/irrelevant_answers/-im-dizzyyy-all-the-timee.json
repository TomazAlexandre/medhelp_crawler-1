            "answer": "you might have Hypoglycemia, my brother\u00a0\u00a0had these same symptoms and was diagnosed with it, he is also 14, all you have to do is get enough sugar a day to keep your blood sugar over 40 and make sure u eat enough, if you dont keep your blood sugar up and you dont eat enough, you could have a hypoglycemic attack which is probably your panic attacks, hypoglycemia\u00a0\u00a0is just\u00a0\u00a0a different type of Diabetes except instead of keeping your blood pressure up and blood sugar down its the exact opposite. dont over work your self and being hypoglycemic is no excuse to stuff yourself with chocolate like my brother does. haha. most of all be careful with the dizziness, get some sugar when u feel dizzy.",

    "question": "I'm 14 years old, and I've been having panic attacks for about the last 5 months, along with anxiety attacks. I constantly feel like crap, sometimes it's my stomach, my head, or just dizzy. It makes it hard to do a lot of extra activities because I'm constantly worried about feeling sick or having another panic attack/anxiety attack. I went to my dr. and he took my blood and everything, did an EKG and everything was perfectly normal. I was perscribed Lorazepam for when I have a REALLY bad panic attack, but I've been dizzy every day all day. Sometimes worse then other. Last week I went to my psycologist and I was perscribed Zoloft, and I've been taking half of a 25mg tablet for the past 4 days. Today I start taking a full 25mg tablet..I guess I was just wondering if there is something seriously wrong with me because I constantly feel like crap, and dizzy all the time???",
