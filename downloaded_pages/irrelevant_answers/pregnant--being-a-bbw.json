Lol..love that..;-) I'm preggers with my fourth and I've never been thin...I've never had issues with high blood pressure or gestational diabetes while pregnant..I feel it has a lot to do with your over all health if you will have problems with that..I'm very careful whilst preggers to eat healthy and walk..with my first I let myself eat whatever I wanted and I gained 55 lbs!!! Second n third I stayed @ 30 lbs..hoping to do the same this time too..its nor so easy to loose lots of weight after baby has come..I started a 16 with first..now a 20 starting with fourth!! But I have good pregnancies in spite of being bigger..;-)",

I gained 30lbs and I had a small baby even though I was huge! I lost the weight pretty fast but my waist is bigger than it was. Old navy is great for maternity clothes for BBW in my experience.
