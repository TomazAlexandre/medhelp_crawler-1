            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The symptoms you are facing could be due to either a brain problem or pinched cervical spinal nerve. A MRI of both brain and cervical spine should be done to see what is causing these symptoms.It could also be related to neck-tongue syndrome. There is upper nuchal (neck) or occipital pain on one side, with or without numbness in these areas. This is accompanied by simultaneous ipsilateral (same side) numbness of the tongue. This numbness is caused by compression of the second cervical root (C2) in the atlantoaxial space.Occipital neuralgia, TIA or ministroke, trigeminal neuralgia should also be looked into.Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain.Please discuss this with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
