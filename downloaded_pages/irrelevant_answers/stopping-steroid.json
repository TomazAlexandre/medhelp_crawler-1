            "answer": "Hi!This is a very tough decision to make. At times the interstitial lung disease is pretty advanced and stopping steroids may aggravate problems. However, steroids can then be given in pulse therapy wherein it can be given for some days and then stopped and restarted. Also, you could watch what you eat and exercise to help reduce your blood sugar levels. Please discuss this with your treating doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
