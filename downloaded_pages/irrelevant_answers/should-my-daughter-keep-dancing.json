            "answer": "My daughter danced until it was time for her to go on pointe, and we had her stop.\u00a0\u00a0It was not because anyone told us she had to, but we didn't want to risk injury to her feet.\u00a0\u00a0However, if our dance school had offered a program where she could stay in ballet without going to pointe, we would have left her in.\u00a0\u00a0I too am curious to see what others' experiences are with this & gain insight.",

            "answer": "My daughter has danced for 7 years - she is 9 y.o. and has been diagnosed with her insulin dependent diabetes for 11 months.\u00a0\u00a0Her dance is her passion and has been her outlet for her personal frustrations and struggles with her diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She is not on pointe yet - we prefer to put it off a little while longer while her feet, ankles and legs continue to mature.\u00a0\u00a0BUT - I can not imagine asking her to stop.\u00a0\u00a0Even if your dance studio does not want to allow her to continue without progressing to pointe - you could move her to another studio.I would have a heart to heart with her to see what she wants.\u00a0\u00a0We have a number of family friends whose daughters are 11 and 12 and train in pointe.\u00a0\u00a0Their daughters do very well.Good luck!",
