            "answer": "The Standard American Diet (SAD) is sad. It is the primary cause of the difficulties that you and the rest of us face here in the good old USA, also ther westernized countries.Gastroenterologists are not needed in third world countries, for the most part. Its the MODERN way of life = eating of western diet that is killing us with digestive problems, diabetes, and heart disease et. al.I strongly encourage you to let the good foods push the bad / processed foods off your plate. Begin to juice (pulp separated from the juice, discard the pulp) several times per day. This will feed your cells, may cause some detoxification, and begin to heal your body including the G.I. tract.If you experience detoxification, then adjustments must be made.Raw fruits and vegetables eaten properly along with other lifestyle changescan radically, and I mean radically, improve your health.Let the digestive tract rest and heal. Healing comes from cellular feeding and activity.Need more info,Contact me at ***@****If you want to be anonymous, get a fake email address and we can correspond through that.I can direct you to many other resources.",

            "answer": "I was having lots of stomach\u00a0\u00a0pain on 60 mg or prevacid. I thought it was caused by the prevacid. Does anyone know if 60 mg of prevacid is safe ? Anyway I changed my psychiatric medication and went back on prozac and the stomach pain is gone most of the time. I also drink one cup of green tea a day and try to eat smaller meals. Serotonin from the prozac helps, I think. Prozac is generic now, so its cheaper than the other types of SSRI drugs.",

The side effects from these medications are very bad.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, there appears to be some evidence that it may help in IBS, but I honestly think the MD's use anti-depressants to freely.\u00a0\u00a0I would try other options first.
