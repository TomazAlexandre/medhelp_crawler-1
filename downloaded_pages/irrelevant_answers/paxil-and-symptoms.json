            "answer": "I have been taking Paxil for about 10 years now.\u00a0\u00a0I don't remember exact details from years before, but I do remember losing a tremendous amount of weight and being nauseous almost constantly.\u00a0\u00a0It was all related to anxiety because now I fight trying to take weight off!\u00a0\u00a0It took time to feel the effects of the Paxil to help reduce the anxiety symptoms that make you feel constantly sick.\u00a0\u00a0But for me, Paxil was the answer.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not start to feel less anxious or sick within the next few weeks, talk to your doctor about maybe changing medication.\u00a0\u00a0What works for some, may not work for others....By the way, I also take Buspar which is an anti-anxiety med.\u00a0\u00a0That in combination with the Paxil allows me to function normally.Best to you.",
