            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If this has not been happening for too long, then she could be having viral fever. Taking acetaminophen for fever and drinking plenty of hot fluids like soup, warm lemonade, herbal tea etc may help. If this has been going on for a long time then conditions which cause evening rise in temperature such as anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue should be ruled out. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis. She will have to go to the doctor for this.Hope this helps. Take care!",
