            "answer": "Hi,How are you?I would suggest you to get yourself screened for diabetes as well. Tingling numbness, increased urge to urinate and constipation can occur in diabetes also.Some of your symptoms like dyslexia and difficulty in swallowing can be due to anxiety and stress.Please make sure you get a restful sleep every night, eat healthy and exercise regularly.White matter disease causes progressive deterioration of cognitive functions and can occur due to damage to the small cerebral blood vessels.A nerve compression in the cervical region can also cause tingling numbness in the extremities and needs to be ruled out.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "More recently, I have had some physical changes that include loss of balance, numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, foot pain, bladder urges without urinating, constipation, some difficulty swallowing, some changes in my keyboarding and handwriting skills, and mild speech dyslexia occassionally.\u00a0\u00a0(I do spend a lot of time by myself, but do not believe that this is hypochondriasis.)\u00a0\u00a0 Two weeks ago I went to a new doctor who ordered an MRI and wanted to check for \"white matter diseases\".\u00a0\u00a0I thought that I was going for help with fibromyalgia, then ended up being evaluated for more than that.\u00a0\u00a0She said that if it was just severe fibromyalgia and degenerative disc disease that would be nothing to treat, but if the white matter diseases were present that would be a different matter entirely.\u00a0\u00a0About six weeks ago, I began walking with a cane, because of back pain and needing support.\u00a0\u00a0I'm anxious about the findings of this MRI, if it is unremarkable, then the doctor wants to have an MRI of my neck done.",
