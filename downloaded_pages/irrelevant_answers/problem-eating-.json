            "answer": "Hi!If you do not have nausea and are pregnant and not feeling like eating, then this could be early stage of nausea. There are a few tips which may help you. One is eat small frequent meals, of simple carbohydrates like unbuttered toast, plain rice, salt cracker, plain baked potatoes etc. Avoid oily and spicy food and heavy meals. Early in the morning take a dry cracker or peppermint while in bed, slightly propped up. Keep sipping lemonade or juice or herbal decaffeinated tea during the day.\u00a0\u00a0If this does not improve your appetite in a day or two, please consult your gynecologist immediately. Gestational diabetes and hypothyroidism would need to be ruled out in your case, along with eating disorder. Hope this helps. Take care!",
