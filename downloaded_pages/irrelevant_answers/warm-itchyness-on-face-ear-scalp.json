            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The probable causes for itchiness could be diabetes mellitus, eczema, tineapedis (fungal infection) and psoriasis. It could be due to iron deficiency anemia, liver and kidney disorders, thyroid disorders and polycythemia. It could also be due to certain medications and food. Others could be due to skin conditions like contact dermatitis and scabies. In contact dermatitis exposure to an irritant like a chemical or metal or anything you are allergic to, can cause rash and itching. You may need to consult a your doctor\u00a0\u00a0who will examine you and may ask for blood tests and in addition examine the scrapings from the skin to arrive at a diagnosis for appropriate therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "It started suddenly at 5am one morning a couple days ago...a lot of itchyness on my left cheek, down to my lips and up to my temple.\u00a0\u00a0It has since become itchy in and around my left ear, around my left eye, and on my scalp.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had any issues with my sinuses before, so not sure if this is a sinus thing or not.There is no skin redness or dryness, just the itchyness, which gets worse at night. I've been getting some very mild and brief headaches in my temple area as well.I originally thought it may be because of a recent tooth extraction affecting the nerves, but since the itchyness has spread to my temple and scalp, i'm trying to find other causes.I've started taking benadryl, so hopefully it will offer some relief.Any ideas on how to alleviate this...or even what could be causing it.\u00a0\u00a0Im not even sure if this is the right forum..it could also fit in the dermatology forum as well, but there is no skin rash, no redness, no dryness, no visible signs of anything wrong.",
