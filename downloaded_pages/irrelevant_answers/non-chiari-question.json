            "answer": "The treatment for DKA is Insulin Sliding Scale Protocol. You can Google it if you want to get more info. Sliding scale is always done in ICU as constant heart\u00a0\u00a0monitoring & kidney output monitoring need to be done.I am glad she is doing better. Is she awake & alert yet?It is possible that the bleeding is edema or edema related.An electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that measures and records the electrical activity of your brain. This will be done if she has seizure activity and to check brain activity.An electrocardiogram (EKG or ECG) is a test that checks for problems with the electrical activity of your heart, this will be done regularly in the hospital.Has your niece any other illnesses?Your niece is not checking her sugars, she is not eating a proper diet and she may be missing her insulin times or may be using her pen incorrectly (if she uses a pen for injecting) or she may have developed a resistance to the brand of insulin she is taking. These are things your sister & niece need to discuss with her doctors. Your niece needs to be under no illusion, she is lucky to be alive, she may not be so lucky next time.Your niece is 18 years old, she is a young adult and she needs to take responsibility for her diabetes. Your sister can encourage and support her but ultimately it is your niece who is the one who needs to learn to live with this. Diabetes is a condition that is easily managed with just a little effort. The long term consequences of not managing diabetes are profound, kidney problems, blindness limb amputations and premature death.http://thepoordiabetic.com/consequences-of-improper-management-of-diabetes/",
