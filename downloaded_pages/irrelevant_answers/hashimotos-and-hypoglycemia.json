            "answer": "Hello...How scary..I know thyroid disorders can play a role in pancreatic function, and the onset of diabetes,but please, just to be sure, have her worked up just in case this is being caused by a insulin-producing tumor...Keep a tube of cake frosting on hand for the lowest sugar times (only give if she is conscious enough to swallow!) -it tastes way better than glucose paste!
