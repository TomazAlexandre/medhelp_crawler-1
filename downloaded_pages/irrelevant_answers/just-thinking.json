            "answer": "Although it's true as Guitar-grrrl says,\u00a0\u00a0that lipid plaques don't collect in veins, the way that they do in arteries, I did post a link before from a recent study that found that vascular problems like high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease are associated with \"more rapid disability progression in multiple sclerosis.\" (http://www.msif.org/en/research/ms_research_news/vascularcomorbra.html)\"Although vascular comorbidity is known to adversely influence health outcomes in several chronic conditions, its influence in MS is not known. The authors of this study found that in MS, vascular comorbidity (i.e. presence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, or heart disease), whether present at symptom onset, diagnosis, or later in the disease course, is associated with a substantially increased risk of disability progression.\"The PubMed abstract (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20350978) says \"treatment of vascular comorbidities may represent an avenue for treating MS.\"This would suggest that staying heart healthy is good for MS, along with being good for general health. There's a lot of research about the negative effects of smoking on MS, too, and, of course, smoking is not good for cardiovascular health, either.As far as helping with CCSVI goes, that's less clear. Interestingly, the woman (Joan or Cheerleader) who has probably done the most to promote CCSVI in North America, got interested in Zamboni's research because of her interest in the relationship between vascular health and MS. In MS, among many problems, the blood-brain barrier wimps out and starts letting through stuff that it shouldn't. The blood-brain barrier is made of endothelial cells, which are also the cells the line the inside of the veins and arteries. She became interested in the work of the cardiologist John P. Cooke on the health of the endothelium (The Cardiovascular Cure http://www.amazon.com/Cardiovascular-Cure-Strengthen-Defense-Against/dp/0767908821). This book recommends a lot of the things you usually hear about (dietary changes, such as good fats and a mostly vegetarian diet, exercise, and if you have problems some supplements and herbs). Dr. Cooke is a colleague of Dr. Dake at Stanford and I think this may have had something to do with getting a foot in the door to convince Dr. Dake to take a chance on this theory and look at her husband's veins.There is no consensus on the cause of CCSVI or its relation to MS. There are a number of researchers who think these venous abnormalities are congenital (present since birth) and mechanical, which would suggest that they couldn't be resolved by lifestyle changes like diet (or drugs). Some things, like missing jugulars, clearly can't be helped by lifestyle changes. However, it would seem like lifestyle changes would generally be helpful for any vascular problem. The BNAC data suggests a correlation between severity of CCSVI and severity of MS, which fits better with MS causing or affecting the CCSVI. There has also been some talk, since the veins are not rigid, the some of these problems may be dynamic and come and go.No answers, but for myself, I do feel better when I eat a healthy diet. Not miraculously better, but noticeably better on average.sho",

            "answer": "I certainly understand where you are coming from in your thought.While it can not 'turn around\" MS,\u00a0\u00a0doing the things you mentioned most definately could not hurt and it has been proven that by doing these things it can help to perhaps maintain (sp) at least for a while, some quality in life.Also it is known that meditaion, excercise, and eating a healthy diet can not only help you physically but it also has a positive affect on our emotional well being. And when we have a positive emotional state, then that in turn will give a positive physical state to some degree.I hope all that makes sense.....Thanks for the post (topic) Alex. :)~Tonya",

    "question": "I was thinking. It has been proven that lifestyle change ( diet, exercise, and meditation ) can turn around coronary artery disease. So why can the same program not work for CCVI?Just a thought.Alex",
