    "question": "I have had 4 severe head injuries in the past, all of which I was knocked unconscience for a few minutes and developed a concussion.I am 21 years old now, and in the past year have seen an increase in my symptoms.Blood tests have shown I am positive for antibodies, abnormal renal function.MRI showed enlarged pituitary, and I also have a fatty liver.As far as neurological goes, I drop things constantly, no longer feel pain in my arms, hands and legs, and feel nothing in my toes. (My toenails are a bright blue color as well.) I fall down or nearly fall at least once per day, and sometimes lose vision in my left eye for several minutes at a time.Most disturbingly, I am losing bladder control, and my hands are covered in cuts and scratches from accidentally hurting myself because I can't feel anything. Constantly thirsty, urinating frequently, large amounts, but they said I didn't have diabetes.The worst part is dehabilitating pain ALL over my body that leaves me bedridden and begging my husband to help me, but nothing works. This happens 2-3 nights a week. Odd rashes, and fatigue, no matter how much sleep I get.I have a very fine GP, but I was sent to a neurologist, who didn't look at any of my tests, and told me it was all in my head, and I had better stop faking and go see a psychiatrist! She asked for all the names of my doctors, and told me she was going to call them and let them know \"my real condition.\" She then refused to order any more tests.I am not depressed, or stressed out, I exercise 7 days a week, eat healthy, get up at 6 AM and go to bed at 9. I am functioning rather well for what I go through physically, but I want to be at my best. Is this all in my head? It seems whenever doctors are stumped they just label you a psychiatric case.",
