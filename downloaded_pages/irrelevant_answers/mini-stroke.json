            "answer": "Hi, the most probable cause for the odd sensation could be neuropathy, a disorder of the nerves. Most common cause for neuropathy is diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It can also be due to metabolic disorders, vitamin deficiencies, infections and traumatic injuries. Sometimes the odd perceptions can be due to temporal lobe seizures. The sensation may needs proper evaluation by your GP, please consult him for a neurological assessment. Regards.",

    "question": "I sometimes get this strange sensation that starts on only one side of my head - left - and I can sense it on the left side of my body, also, all the way down to my groin/testicles. I find it hard to describe the sensation. It is almost like a head rush - or a chill or tingle - in my brain; and it is accompanied by memories that usually take a more linguistic form: I remember words being said or written, plus a little about the context. However, within what seems like milliseconds, it dissipates and I cannot remember what the words/memories were. The sensation doesn't happen often, but when it does, there is usually a cluster of them over a few-hour period. It happened this morning, and the only thing I can link to it was having some unual and very vivid dreams overnight. I awoke feeling a little confused. Any thoughts?",
