In the US, the doctor may ordered a clean urine catch to coincide with a fasting blood draw or an OGTT [Oral Glucose Tolerance Test]. If you are concerned about diabetes ask for an A1c test [Hb1c, HbA1c] which is used as the standard tool to determine glucose [blood sugar] control.",

            "answer": "Urine test reveals, more often than not, the presence of diabetes. That was certainly the case with me. However, in early stages or in the pre-diabetes stage your kidneys may not be 'spilling out\" the excess glucose from your blood and one may get a false sense security. This situation can last for a number of years with consequent damage to your organs by the high blood glucose. So my advice to you, if your urine is clear of glucose and you are still concerned, is to undergo the OGTT mentioned by Waverider above.You have my best wishes.",

            "answer": "You can Google diabetes symptoms to see if you are experiencing any/all. Many people do not get diabetic symptoms - some do, some don't.\"So basically would you guys trust the urine result? is it reasonably reliable you think?\"Yes. You should not have apprehensions about medical tests. If in doubt Google them - read, understand and apply the test to yourself. Always know what you're going to the doctor for and have three questions ready to ask him/her. Get them answered to your liking before you leave. Does your doctor answer questions via email? I know several that do.A urine test looks for several different materials aside from Keytones [excess glucose]. It can identify possible issues with bacteria, urinary tract infection, kidney waste material, and several other body issues. When a positive hit occurs the doctor normally orders further testing to concur with the initial findings. Also keep in mind it is the doctors preference in what order test are ordered. Urine may be first with one doctor and then a blood draw and vice versa with another doctor.",

            "answer": "In early stages you may feel normal, however, I was diagnosed by my aunt based on her observation that I was going to the bathroom too often and drinking water as if I had just returned from trip to the desert..She had the urine strips in the house because my uncle was a diabetic. After watching my trips to bathroom and water drinking she asked me to do the urine test and sure enough\u00a0\u00a0it was positive. I was only 22 at that time and under the belief that this was disease of the old and or the middle aged !As has been mentioned before, in early stages , you may not have overt symptoms like I did. Only a blood test may reveal at that stage whether you are diabetic or not",

    "question": "Hi, would like to know what people think about urine testing.Is this a decent first step for checking for diabetes? I have been told its for checking to see if you have any glucose in the urine, depending on that you would then need the blood test. Im in the UK and it seems the first step is the urine test according to my NHS walk in centre but you can ask for the blood test straight away if your really worried....but I think that depends on any symptoms.Ive heard different opinions on the urine test though, I have been told that its no good by one or two people but then afew others have said its fine for an intial check.Ive had a urine test and it was ok so Im just curious, as it was clear is that it? am I clear for diabetes?thanks.",
