            "answer": "There are two different kinds of antibodies. Having them suggests that you have either (or occasionally I've seen people on here with both) Grave's diesase or Hashimoto's. These are autoimmune disease that attack the thyroid. Once the process starts there isn't much that can be done, but depending on your disease that will determine the treatment.TSH is a signalling hormone. It doesn't show exactly what the thyroid itself is doing (for that it's best to use free T4 and t3) but it's probably safe to say you don't feel well. Having a Tsh high usually means you have the symptoms of hypothyroidism, or that your thyroid is under active. Hypothyroidism is treated using hormones such as levothyroxine, which is what I'm on.It takes about 6-8 weeks for the hormone to start to make a difference and even then, it might not be enough. Work carefully with your dr to try to get your thyroid working in normal ranges. And in the future, demand for those Free t4 and t3 tests as they actually show what the thyroid itself is doing.",

            "answer": "Actually, there are 3 different antibodies.\u00a0\u00a02 of them determine whether or not you have Hashimoto's, the other is definitive for Graves.Can you tell us which antibodies you have?\u00a0\u00a0Have you been diagnosed with anything yet?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had Free T3 and/or Free T4 tests done?\u00a0\u00a0These are the actual thyroid hormones and are much more important than TSH.Have you been started on any type of thyroid medication?\u00a0\u00a0If so, which med(s)/dosage(s)?Sorry to ask so many questions, but it's hard to respond adequately without enough information.The thyroid is part of the endocrine system, so a thyroid specialist would normally be an endocrinologist; however, please be aware that not all endo are good thyroid doctors; many of them specialize in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Any doctor can treat your thyroid condition, so long as they are willing to test and treat properly.",
