            "answer": "Zyprexa is the antipsychotic that is most likely to cause this. I myself gained 35 pounds when I was on Zyprexa. Abilify the least likely but it still can happen. The antipsychotic agent I am on in Phase II FDA study won't do this but it hasn't been studied for mood stabilization yet and I need a mood stabilizer as well. Out of the mood stabilizers, Lithium and Depakoate are more likely to cause weight gain than Lamictal so Lamictal might be one viable option.",
