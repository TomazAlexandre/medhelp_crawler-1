    "question": "My cousin Nancy has been having these really bad health problems but won't go to the doctor. She is 38 use to excersise 3 times a day, eat a well balanced meal and take care of herself with the exception of having one to two glasses of alcohol and a cigeret before bed. Last year and this year she started to lose a lot of weight, she is 5'7 and was 110, now she is 89lbd, she feels pain, joints muscles and bones, she can barley walk, or eat, her hair went from thick and long to cotton. She said here feet feel like she's walking on glass and her fingers are numb. She has to drink 7-up in the morning because she has this white foam stuff that comes up when she burps. Her body is super thin yet her face looks swollen and puffy. She said she doesn't have an appetite, she is scared to go to the doctor, it's been ten years since she last went, she has a history of family diabetes. What can it be? Anyone'!!",
