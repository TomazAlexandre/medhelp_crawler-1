            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Once in a while it can be due to urinating too rapidly. Mild dehydration is another cause. You could drink more water to see if it goes away.However, persistently foamy urine can be a sign of protein in your urine (proteinuria), which requires further evaluation. Large amounts of protein in urine may indicate a serious kidney problem. Urinary tract infections (UTIs) and retrograde ejaculation and prostatitis in men are the other causes.Also anemia, hypothyroidism, diabetes should be ruled out.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
