            "answer": "If I were you, I would ask my doctor to run some tests to find out if you have antibodies present that show that your body's immune system is attacking your pancreas. This is what causes true type 1 diabetes. If these antibodies are present, then you will need to take insulin: oral meds only help type 2 diabetics, who make insulin, but who are insulin-resistant. As for the insulin causing your pancreas to quit working, no, this is not what happens. Your pancreas is stopping working because of an immune system attack on its beta cells if you are a true type 1 diabetic. Some people do continue to make some of their own insulin, but most people eventually quit making it altogether. But this is not because of the insulin, and the amount of insulin you take has nothing to do with what happens to your pancreas. So take the amount that you need in order to normalize your glucose levels, and don't worry about it hurting you.As for getting pregnant as a type 1 diabetic, as long as your glucose levels are under very good control, there is no danger to you if you decide to have another baby. Many diabetics have children.",

            "answer": "hi vol,thanks for ur reply. Just wanted to reconfirm that are you sure the insulin i take will not be responsible for making my pancreas dormant...I was praying that maybe later in life my pancreas start making insulin again and then I will not have to take insulin..I had got the antibodies test done...my beta cells are dead and I am definitely type 1 diabetic. From your reply, i have understood that medicines will not help me.Hope i get stable glucose levels soon and then I will definitely consult my doctor before planning my second baby. Thanks for ur encouragement!What about my taking insulin three times a day? Is it ok?",

    "question": "Hello,I m 26 yrs old female, married with 1.75 yrs old daughter. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes three months ago. I have started taking insulin novomix since last two months.My four queries are :1) I m insulin dependent and concerned of its life long effects on my pancreas. Right now, pancreas are producing say only about 2% insulin. Does external intake of insulin takes pressure off my pancreas and helps it to start producing more insulin little by little? Or does long usage of external insulin makes my pancreas ultimately dormant and totally inactive? I want my pancreas to start making its own insulin. Is it possible?2) I used to take insulin twice a day - 20 units before breakfast and 10 units before dinner. Since I often got low sugar levels like 58 to 65 after breakfast, I have now started taking insulin thrice a day - 10 units before breakfast, 10 units before lunch and 10 units before dinner. This seems to work fine for me. Is taking insulin thrice a day safe?3) Should I start taking medicines sumone suggested like mesobit or glynase....I was taking amryl which i have stopped now?4) Can i plan my second baby safely after 6 months? There is no history of diabetes in my entire family.Waiting for any tip/advice you can give me. Thanks.",
