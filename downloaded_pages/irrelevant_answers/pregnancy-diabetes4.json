            "answer": "Neither eating nor craving sweet foods causes gestational diabetes. Some women's bodies react to pregnancy hormones in a way that makes it difficult for them control their glucose levels.Every pregnant woman is tested for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks.Gestational diabetes doesn't directly harm the fetus. Problems arise, however, when it is uncontrolled. To quote my previous OB: \"Sugar grows babies.\" Meaning, if your sugars are uncontrolled, you have the potential for having a large baby (9 lbs and up). You may not be able to deliver such a large baby vaginally and a C-section may be necessary.In most cases, gestational diabetes is easily controlled with diet and exercise. In some cases, though, insulin injections are necessary.",

            "answer": "I forgot to add that at birth, the nurses will check the baby's blood sugar levels. If they are low, they will have the baby eat (either breast or bottle) to bring the sugars up.I believe my baby was tested at three different time points after delivery.",
