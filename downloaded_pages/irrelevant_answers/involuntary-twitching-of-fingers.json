Nothing that you describe is in the typical list of diabetes symptoms and that is what we're knowledgable about in this forum.",

    "question": "hi - i just recently signed onto MedHelp because i am extremely worried about a problem i believe i have. I'm not exactly sure what i have and hopefully i will get some answers here. During the day i experience involuntary twitching of my fingers and also twitching of my leg and toes sometimes. During the nighttime, just before i sleep (i am still half-conscious) my legs sometimes give a small or large jerk and it wakes me up. Sometimes it is my legs, and other times it is my fingers. It is very distressing and i am worried. Also, when i put my arm half on the table and stretch out my hand it trembles sometimes. Could this be because i may have cut blood circulating to the fingers causing the tremble or something more? The most stragnest thing is when i stretch/tighten my foot downward (like a ballerina) it trembles quite alot. Please, can someone help me answer these questions.",
