    "question": "I am a 24yr old female. I started my period when I was only 9yrs. old. I have always had abnormal periods. I was also diagnosed with PCOS about a year ago. It turns out that the PCOS is what is causing my hirsutism. Recently my hair growth has increased(I shave more than my husband and in more places). I have also been feeling full or swollen all the time, specially after I eat or drink anything. I have also been having pain on my right side that shoots down my leg and discomfort during intercourse. Another weird symptom is gas, lots of gas and feeling sick during intercourse. On 3 different occassions I have been to ER for severe stomach pain and nausea(which I was told was probably an ulcer or gastritis). This last time which was a few days ago I went in the middle of the night like the other two times with the same pain except this time the pain wasnt just burning in my stomach it was also cramp like pain in pelvic are.The ER physician did a vaginal ultrasound and found fluid in uterus. He gave me something for pain and imflammation and told me to follow up with doctor. Should I be worried?",
