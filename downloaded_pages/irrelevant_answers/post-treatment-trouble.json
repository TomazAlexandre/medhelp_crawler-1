            "answer": "I would see an ophthalmologist about your eyes. Treatment can affect vision - I suffered a retinal tear during treatment..Are you still undetectable for HCV?HCV is associated with cognitive issues but my understanding is that they usually resolve with a sustained viral response - undetectable at 6 months post treatment or, as I prefer, undetectable at 1 year post treatment. What you describe is more severe than what I am accustomed to seeing. Usually it's described as \"brain fog\" or \"forgetfulness\".People report fibromyalgia post treatment so that may be related to your pain and fatigue. I really don't know much about this \"side effect' but many people do seem to suffer with fibromyalgia after HCV and treatment.I suppose a PCP is the starting place but I think you'll do better with specialists - an ophthalmologist for sure and probably a gastroenterologist and/or hepatologist and a neurologist.Good luck,Mike",

            "answer": "I had troubles post treatment also. It is my belief that it is the result of the massive amount of inflamation that the Interferon causes. The only way I got it to subside was to start on a vegan diet. Vegan diets reduce inflamation in the body. It worked for me. Eat oatmeal, fruits, and veggies and stay away from meat. The sauturated fat causes inflamation.I know this sounds severe but it worked for me.Bobby",

            "answer": "Although our tx may differ; I tx'd in 2000 w/Intron A 2b w/riba and don't know yours, I can relate\u00a0\u00a0to your sx situation. Interferon 'fog and hangover', I first heard these terms back in some old posts by Jim (jmjm530 back in 2007) and it made me aware that others did have the same longer term sx. Mine were pretty miserable for about 3 yrs before becoming more sporadic as time went on. I got the same 'all in your mind' stuff often for years, as I would still have 'hangover' episodes that would last weeks. I may have to agree with Bobby1952. After some recent lab work my PCP noticed some test results were similar to diabetes. While not having diabetes, I started a 'diabetes based' diet and have felt more energetic and overall just... better. I don't know if this will help you out but know that you aren't alone with the sx. Best of luck to you.Speed",

            "answer": "It has been my experience that most specialist dont believe whats going on or dont know much about hep C treatment. Of course, the hep C gurus say that it could never be their treatment and blindly send you off to some other specialist who simply goes down the list of their test and send you away with a slip which often times shows nothing in the bloodwork.I have had most luck with local PCP/GPs who seem to get the folk really messed up (hello, thats me) and are seeing more and more.I guess I am rather lucky as one of my GPs had two liver transplants, used the treatment one mix before my newer mix and has had zero problems. His wife is a nurse and must have stuck herself and got C also. She treated (and \"cured\") but in the past five years is suffering neurological damage that is getting worse - and her husband, my doc, cant help her!!!Sooooo, at least my docs dont blow me off...",

            "answer": "I have some lingering problems like what you describe but much less severe. I raised them with my hepatologist (my new insurance prevents me from seeing him) and he emailed back that a few (maybe 3% - don't remember) have long term post treatment effects. It could also be that you have some other underlying issue - it's very easy to infer a cause & effect relationship where it may not exist. Try to get a full work up of everything.",
