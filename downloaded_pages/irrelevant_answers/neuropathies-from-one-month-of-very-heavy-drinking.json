    "question": "Hi all,I am 46 years old and have been suffering from depression for nearly 18 months following an HIV scare and other issues.I have been a moderate, social drinker for 25 years but, as my depression worsened, I turned to self-medication in September and drank very heavily in October (last month).\u00a0\u00a0In particular, I had two binges where, on both occasions, I consumed two bottles of spirits in a 36 hour period, and had detox in hospital both times.I have not drunk since then, however, since then I have begun to have pins and needles and numbness in my feet and hands, also in my mouth and around my lips, have constipation, blurred vision and complete loss of libido.\u00a0\u00a0I also get dizzy when I stand up.\u00a0\u00a0My voice is also weak andI visited my doctor on Monday this week and he did various tests, including with a reflex hammer, and he said these were normal.\u00a0\u00a0He put it down to my body recovering and anxiety.I am obviously worried.about this.\u00a0\u00a0Could one month of very heavy drinking (after many years of social drinking) cause neuropathic damage?Appreciate your comments and help.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
