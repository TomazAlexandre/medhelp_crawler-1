            "answer": "Zyprexa works in basically the same manner as all atypical antipsychotics and has the strongest potential for mood stabilization but also the greatest potential of weight gain. The potential of diabetes is managable but any sudden weight gain should be reported to the psychiatrist as this can be kept in check (this potential occurs with all atypical antipsychotics). The potential of temporary movement disorders can be treated with a side effect pill if needed. The potential of long term movement disorders such as tardive dyskinesia is a concern with all antipsychotics (except for Clozaril which has a severe side effect profile of its own which is the reason it isn't used more but for some people can be helpful) and occurs at a specific statistical rate. A good website for more information on that is \"Patient Education Tardive Dyskinesia\" (note as the site says \"some of these medications may be medically necessary\"). All psychiatrists will do a movement disorders test at regular intervals to watch for this. All of this information could be discussed with the psychiatrist. I did have an issue with sedation as regards Zyprexa but I also found it to be quite helpful on treating psychosis.As per schizophrenia and all psychotic disorders generally within a psychiatrist's discretion an antipsychotic is needed and the risk/benefit ratio is worth it given what untreated schizophrenia is like. It should also be noted that there are a new generation of antipsychotics in Phase II FDA study (the NMDA receptor modulates) that won't cause tardive dyskinesia or diabetes and may have a fuller recovery so its a matter of adjusting to current treatment until the research on newer and safer treatment modalities completes the studies in the coming years.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for helping me with my question. I have also been giving him Vitamin C, Omega-3 and Niacin. I don't know if these will help him, but if can't hurt. I guess my other question would be is there any other Vitamins that might help him? I love my son and I will do anything to keep him healthy physically and mentally. Also how long can I expect to see any changes in my son if Zyprexa is the one for him. More important when will he see the changes?",

            "answer": "Zyprexa from what I am aware (and remember from taking it) takes a while to build up to a proper blood level where it shows efficacy but you could ask his psychiatrist more about this. I am not sure if there are any vitamins that are specifically effective on schizophrenia. I was in the past instructed by one psychiatrist to take vitamin e because it was believed to have a preventative effect on tardive dyskinesia but recent research has somewhat disproven that.\u00a0\u00a0It will take a while to see the full efficacy of the medication but it would be essential to keep track of how it is helping and inform the psychiatrist about this so they would know how to adjust and titrate it within their discretion.",

    "question": "My son is 15 and just started taking Zyprexa Olanzapine tablets yesterday. He is taking 5mg this week and the next 2 weeks he goes up to 10mg. The side effects I am reading on this drug sound very scary. His psychiatrist wants to meet with him more before giving him a diagnosis, but when he does I am pretty sure it will be schizophrenia.I just want to know if Zyprexa has helped anyone or what I can expect from this drug.Thank you so much",
