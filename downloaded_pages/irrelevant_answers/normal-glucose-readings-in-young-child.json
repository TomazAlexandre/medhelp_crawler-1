            "answer": "I am not a physician, but a volunteer and the mom of a type 1 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I understand your fear for your other children; I have friends that have gone though the same feelings.\u00a0\u00a0 There are several things I would suggest.The first is I would discuss your fears with your daughter's endocrinologist, he can tell you the range that would be appropriate for your 6 yr old. YOu can also ask him about having your son tested to see if he is developing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0There are several tests that can be done including a genetic test to see if he has the gene that predisposes him to diabetes. It does NOT mean that he will get diabetes.The other thing that I would suggest is getting involved with a support group. You can contact Juvenile diabetes research foundation by going to www.JDRF.org. Your daughter",

            "answer": "Hello,I am a crazy mom!\u00a0\u00a0LOLMy son will be 11 in Feb and was dxd at age 3.\u00a0\u00a0He is on an insulin pump that he went on in Aug. of 2004.\u00a0\u00a0We love it!\u00a0\u00a0(I just had to mention that)I have a 6 yr. old daughter, as well and have had the same experience you have with your boy.My daughter has had some what I call \"out of range\" or elevated BG's, as well.\u00a0\u00a0177, 183, etc. and then she will have normal BG's.\u00a0\u00a0We thought about having the antibody test done on her, but decided against it for 3 reasons:1. we will have to hold her down while she kicks and screams while blood is taken2. if it is positive, I will be waiting and wondering WHEN \"it\" (diabetes) will come3. I WILL see the symptomsMy son's endo said that the insulin production would have to slow down by 80% to really see steady highs and we both agree that I will see the symptoms and I will continue to do what I have been doing...test her when I notice she is peeing a lot, very thirsty or just very cranky or not herself.Okay, now to the peeing thing.My daughter went through this phase where she LITERALLY went EVERY 5 minutes and I would test her BG and it would be normal.\u00a0\u00a0I even thought she might have a bladder infection, but she did not.\u00a0\u00a0This may sound mean to some people, but I started ignoring it...Sure, if it had gone on and not stopped, I would have sought additional medical advice, but I stopped commenting on it, while still testing her BG from time to time.\u00a0\u00a0I thought possibly it was a nervous problem OR maybe she had the feeling of not getting it all out.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped making a big deal about it and stopped asking her questions and if she had to go 6 times after putting her to bed, fine (I said, if you have to go pe, get up go and then go back to bed) and you know what?\u00a0\u00a0It stopped.\u00a0\u00a0She no longer goes every 5 minutes.To add to that, my son went through the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure at what age, but I do know that he had already been diagnosed, so I would think \"high BG\" but then he wouldn't be high when tested, so I had him checked for infection and it was neg. so I ignored it and it subsided.Believe me, I am not the type of mom to ignore symptoms, nor take them lightly.\u00a0\u00a0I was the one who insisted my son be tested for diabetes when his doc said, \"Some kids ask for a lot to drink for attention.\"\u00a0\u00a0(We changed pediatricians right after that.)You go with your Mommy gut feeling.\u00a0\u00a0I am not telling you to ignore symptoms...I just wanted to share my story.When Brianna was going pee every 5 min., I was a basket case!\u00a0\u00a0I kept worrying about what it could be and then I stopped even talking about it and it stopped.Whew!\u00a0\u00a0I can blab or write...sorry so long-winded!Take care:)SS",

    "question": "I am trying to find out if anyone has any input on normal glucose readings for a 6 year old non diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I have a 14 year old daughter diagnosed with type I diabetes 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0She is doing as well as can be expected for a teenager.\u00a0\u00a0Ever since she was diagnosed I do worry about one of my two boys developing it.\u00a0\u00a0We check them frequently if they are ill or appear to have symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0What worries me is that my 6 year old goes through stages where he will have frequent urination (sometimes up to 6 times in an hour) and then it just stops.\u00a0\u00a0I check him and his glucose always appears to be in the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of days ago we were having supper and my husband asked my son if he felt ok.\u00a0\u00a0He looked pale and had dark rings under his eyes.\u00a0\u00a0He said he felt ok.\u00a0\u00a0We went shopping and he started complaing that he was having a lot of side pain (left side)and was very thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0We immediately went home because these were the same feelings that my daugher had prior to being diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0When we got home and checked his reading he was 160.\u00a0\u00a0This was about two and a half hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0We checked him again and hour later and he was 98.\u00a0\u00a0I know the 98 is normal but was the other.\u00a0\u00a0I could not find a thing in the diabetic books about it for a non diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Also, would these be symptoms of pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I just worry constantly about something happening and would appreciate any feedback.Thanks",
