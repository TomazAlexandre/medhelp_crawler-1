            "answer": "Thank you for your response.\u00a0\u00a0I found it very hard to believe that I don't have anemia too. So not sure if a mistake was made or not in the tests.. I'm not sure if I've had Platelet tests done, but I'm going to my family doctor at the end of the month so I will mention that to him. My stool was checked before, but they found nothing.I have not been checked for HIV, but I do find that very unlikely for me to have... I suppose I will mention that too, though, just to be on the safe side.I will also have him look into SLE and autoimmune disorders.Thanks again.",

    "question": "I'm a 20 year old female, and for the past while I've been getting many strange symptoms... I am bruising very easily from the lightest impact (ex yesterday played some volleyball with friends and now my wrists are completely bruised and swollen), my weight keeps fluctuating (nothing drastic, but when I notice weight gain my stomach seems to have a bloat to it and it's usually sore to touch), some mornings after eating I ended up throwing up or feeling extremely nauseous (tested for pregnancy - negative), I'm noticing that I'm usually very tired and weak (I'm in good shape, but sometimes just after climbing a small flight of stairs I notice my heart beating very rapidly and I feel almost dizzy), I've been getting burning pain in my joints/bones, Sometimes I do wake up in the night with sweating, but it doesn't seem to be anything terribly bad. I also seem to catch colds and flus really easily as soon as I'm around other people.I recently had some blood work done which showed my RBC/Hemoglobin at a low level, but I tested negative for anemia and iron deficiency. Also, when my urine was tested the WBC was high. The drop in the RBC happened over about 3 months, as prior to my last test I had a previous one where everything was fine. The doctor at the walk in clinic said I had lost a lot of blood, but I don't understand from what. I have had no injury and my periods are the same as they've always been. I've also been tested for diabetes, which too came back negative. My lymph nodes, to me, seem normal, but my left breast seems a lot more swollen then the other and it can be a little sore at times. I thought I noticed a lump before, got the doctor at the walk in to check, and he said he doesn't think it's anything right now, but to monitor it just it case.I'm completely confused as to what might be going on, and I'm a little worried that it might be something serious. The only cancers that I have been informed of in my family have been cervical (my aunt had that) and I believe stomach (grandpa had that)Any ideas what you think might be going on???",
