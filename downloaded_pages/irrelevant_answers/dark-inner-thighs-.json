It presents as symmetrical, hyperpigmented, velvety plaques mostly in the folds of skin. It is not itchy and is characterized by hyperpigmentation. My sincere advice is to consult a dermatologist. Biopsy skin may be done to confirm the diagnosis.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hello,Hydroquinone is commonly used for hyperpigmentation but it is not without side effects. So follow up with your doctor. If it still persists then you can go in for laser treatment, Chemical peeling or microdermabrasion. Avoid picking, harsh scrubbing, and abrasive treatments unless prescribed by a dermatologist during this period.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
