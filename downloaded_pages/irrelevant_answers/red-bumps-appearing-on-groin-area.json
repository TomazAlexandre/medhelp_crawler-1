It's become so bad that I have to sleep without any underwear or even a blanket over the area. They also itch periodically, but I fear to scratch for multiple reasons, least of all the pain it causes.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Painful itchy red bumps in the groin area can be due to bacterial infection. If you have a high blood sugar as in diabetes, then this infection can happen. It can also happen without the presence of diabetes. Usually it is due to the bacteria staphylococcus. This is treated by taking anti-inflammatory drugs, applying antibacterial creams and generally keeping the area dry and clean. However one cannot start the treatment without consulting a doctor as this can also be a viral outbreak as in herpes. It can be a fungal infection too. If there is history of unprotected sex then a STD panel should be done.It would be a good idea to consult a skin specialist as even by observing a photograph on net it is difficult to give a confirmed diagnosis.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "For the last couple of weeks I have been experiencing what I thought were just ingrown hairs, but have decided to rule that out. I have had red bumps appearing on my groin area, some of the smaller ones just go away, the larger ones swell and sometimes pop, much like a pimple, producing a scary amount of puss. I have linked to a picture.http://i35.tinypic.com/25fm88y.jpg",
