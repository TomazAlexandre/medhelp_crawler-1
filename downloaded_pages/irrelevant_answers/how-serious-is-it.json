            "answer": "Hi Katie--I'm not a doctor, but from what I understand in doing reading (my parents both have had congestive heart failure so I've been concerned about whether it's hereditary), congestive heart failure (CHF) as such is not hereditary. But many of the conditions that can lead to CHF run in families---like high blood pressure, diabetes, heart arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation, etc.CHF can be acute or chronic. If it's severe enough, people can die from it, but many people live for years with CHF. My Dad was diagnosed with it in 2008 and he's 84 and still goes dancing. My Mom was first diagnosed with it in 2008, too. She's had some other nonheart problems since then and her CHF is now causing more of a problem.If left untreated, CHF progresses.If your husband has diabetes or even prediabetes, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, etc. it is important he gets those conditions under control and follows doctors' orders.Also, he needs to avoid using salt at the table.Does he walk regularly or do some other forms of physical activity? If the doctor says it's OK, he should start on a walking program. Once a person has had a heart attack, they are at risk of having another one unless they change the things that led to the heart attack in the first place--like possibly smoking, excess alcohol, inactivity, high fat diet, high cholesterol level, and the biggie--stress.The Cleveland Clinic and Mayo Clinic websites have a lot of good information on CHF.Probably the best things you can do to help your hubby is try not to nag (I know that can be hard for me sometimes!); cook healthy foods whenever you can when you do the cooking; try not to keep a lot of salt junk-type foods in the house if you do the shopping; and ask him to go on walks with you (after you get the doctor's OK) or ask him to go swimming, biking, etc. with you.Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hi,How is your husband? Congestive heart failure is a condition in which the heart can no longer pump enough blood to the rest of the body. This is a serious disorder, it is a chronic illness that may get worse with infection or other physical stress. However, this can be controlled with medication, lifestyle changes, and treatment of any underlying disorder. Close monitoring from your husband doctor is highly recommended. Take care and do keep us posted.",
