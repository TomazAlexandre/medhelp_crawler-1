            "answer": "Hello,Have you noticed this sensation recently or since last few months? If it is a chronic issue, then it could possibly be your perception of relative warmth and not actually a serious problem. However, if your testicle feels acutely warm all of a sudden it could be due to infections. Few of these are sexually transmitted infections .It is best to see a primary care doctor. Few other possibilities are a neuropathy , diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. It can also be due to vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition. Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. See a doctor and get a clinical examination done. I sincerely hope it helps.Best wishes and kind regards!",
