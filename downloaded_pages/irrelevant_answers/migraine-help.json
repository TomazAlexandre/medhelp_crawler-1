            "answer": "I have light sensitivity when it comes to my eyes,and certain \"triggers\" cause me to have a migraine.Such as heat,sunlight,squinting for too long(which is why i wear glasses) exhaustion,not getting enough sleep,or if i dont eat enough.Thank God i have not had any while im pregnant.But if and when i do have migraines theres not much i could do except try to avoid the triggers.I usually have to wear shades if its bright outside or carry an umbrella to block out the heat,i drink as much water as possible and try to stay cool during the day.Whenever i have a migraine i get really dizzie and i cant see clearly,pain behind the eyes and side of head,pounding,every loud sound makes it worst.lights dont help.And almost every time i throw up because of the dizziness.Ill take 800mg of ibprofin,and sleep in a dark quite room till it subsides.",

    "question": "When I was driving to work today I couldn't focus on the road I was having a hard time seeing at all. Then I got to work and I work at a call center on a computer I couldn't even clearly see my screen. It was so hard to concentrate and I had pressure behind my eyes but not any real pain.then I started throwing up not sure if it was related or just a migraine. My mom thinks it might be diabetes from not getting enough nutrients? And idea or suggestions?",
