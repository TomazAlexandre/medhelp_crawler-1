            "answer": "HiI am glad we are on the right track.I would suggest you see your thyroid specialist. Maybe you need to adjust your medication after testing for thyroid status. Also please get your blood pressure monitored on a regular basis say once in 15 days since you do have a history of low blood pressure.Normally prolapsed mitral valves are asymptomatic and any symptoms arising out of it will usually not detected by an EKG. Since you had a recent echo and a mitral valve prolapsed was detected and left untreated I feel that may not be the cause of your dizziness and heart pounding. However I would suggest you see your cardiologist since you had this symptom. Please discuss with him why you are having low blood pressure problem too. Left side chest pain that comes and goes could be due to heart or even due to acidity (what we call heartburn).Please let me know if there is anything else you wish to know and keep me posted about your health.",
