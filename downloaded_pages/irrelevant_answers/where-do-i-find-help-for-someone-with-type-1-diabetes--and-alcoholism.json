            "answer": "Thanks for posting!Your boyfriend is luckier than he can ever imagine having a great person like you to care for him in his time of need... I know exactly what he's going through, as I am a recovering alcoholic W/ diabetes. I wish I had someone like you when I was going through my darkest hours. Luckily my parents came over one evening and I happened to be in a diabetic shock. Anyway I didn't die, and I found help at a great inpatient treatment center. It's called Valley Hope, and it's in O'neil, Nebraska. Check it out at www.valleyhope.com. That place saved my life, and helped restore my sanity. I wish you the best of luck, and if it's meant to be, it will all turn out in the end.Godspeed,Jess",

            "answer": "You probably don't want to hear this, but your boyfriend has to want to get help before he can truly deal with his addiction. You can do the research, get the phone numbers, recommend inpatient and outpatient rehabs, refer him to addiction specialists and endocrinologists--but the bottom line is that nothing will change unless he wants to recover.Keeping that in mind, you could probably open the phone book and look in the yellow pages. You'll probably find several outpatient rehabs or addiction recovery centers. If you call a few, you can also get a schedule of meetings for Alcoholics Anonymous. Also ask about seeing a medical doctor in rehab, because your boyfriend will definitely need an endocrinologist to get back on track with his insulin--not to mention, his condition will have an effect on the anti-depressants or anti-anxiety meds that are normally presecribed.Another option--have you tried mentioning his binges and chronic drinking to the ER doctors or paramedics? This might make your boyfriend mad, but perhaps hearing a doctor reprimand him and remind him of his fragile condition would help snap him out of it. Again, it probably wouldn't be the magical solution. But it might help in the long run--ie, to bombard him with resources and information.And the, unfortunately, you will have to let go and allow him to choose his fate. This will be the most difficult part. Fortunately, you don't have to do this alone. I would highly recommend that you seek out an Al-Anon meeting. These meetings can be really helpful. Al-Anon is all about the people who are effected by alcoholics--husbands, wives, kids, roommates, best friends, cousins, etc. And it's all about learning to let go--knowing when to help someone, and knowing when you have no control and have to let go.Good luck. My heart really goes out to you. I had a boyfriend who is an insulin-dependent diabetic--Type I, diagnosed at age 12. And he was an alcoholic. Still is, I think. I used to have to call the paramedics at 6am, when he was waking up from a hangover and having an insulin reaction. I would feed him grape jelly with my fingers--stuff it down his throat, while waiting for the paramedics. I tried to convince him to stop drinking. His answer was to drink stuff that had 'less sugar'--like beer, and then eat tons of carbs before passing out. Ha. Anyway, after five years we broke up. Not because of the drinking--however, it was a big part of my decision to leave him. He just didn't want to face the music, and I didn't want to watch him die. I had to take care of myself--it felt selfish at the time, but truthfully, I had no control over him and his decisions. So I can feel your pain and I truly hope he listens to you and decides to get help for himself.Love, Leigh",

            "answer": "Hi,I'd like to give you one other suggestion to compliment the others you've already been given. If you feel that he is medically unable to detox at home,you can do what iss called an intervention. This is when you get everyone he cares about,his family,friends, and sometimes even a boss,to confront him about his drinking. It is run by an experienced addiction professional who knows exactly the right things to say. You call any rehab center and ask. Or as Hippy suggested have an AA member do it, if they are willing to. The idea is to get him to agree to rehab by a show of force. I agree that an alchoholic has to want to quit drinking the thing is, sometimes we don't know that we want to. Alot of people have been forced into rehab and discovered while in there how truly messed up their lives have become. Sometimes it works and unfortunately sometimes it doesn't. This obviously isn't something that you can take lightly but if he is truly as bad as you think he is, I think an intervention is needed. His life may depend on it.",

A year ago right now, I would've been hitting the streets with a .350 blood alcohol content getting into my sports car hoping that I wouldn't run any of you over as I drove around at speeds frequently exceeding 120 mph, and not caring if I lived or died.\u00a0\u00a0(By the way, if you wondered why I'm talking about driving with such a high blood alcohol content, it is simply because my tolerance was so damned high that I actively participated in one of those police sponsored nights of drinking and driving events where you would consume one drink per seven to ten minutes, go out and drive around the parking lot taking the police's sponsored test, drink again, take the test again, etc. etc. etc.\u00a0\u00a0To make a long story short, after three hours of drinking and driving my test scores changed so little that two of the cops asked if I was an alcoholic...\u00a0\u00a0Ha ha ha ha, I told them \"yes\", and \"thank you for the free drinks, that's what I came!\"Please kids, if you're reading this I'm not trying to be funny about drinking and driving...\u00a0\u00a0It's only by the grace of God that I didn't kill someone or myself because of my stupidity.My point is, life is so much more worth living now, that I do say thank you to God every day, and pray for all of you who are trying to make it to the side of sobriety.\u00a0\u00a0I'm new here, but I like it.I love you all!P.S. Angst/Ava, I think someone else said it already, but I think that you might be that Angel that Skip always talks about.\u00a0\u00a0You do such a great job welcoming all of the newcomers to this forum.\u00a0\u00a0Nobody ever has to wait more than 8 to hours from posting anything without getting a response from you!\u00a0\u00a0I wish you the best in your recovery, and don't worry, I know your methadone maintenance will be hard as hell to taper off of, but with your strength, and all love that we have for you, you will be successful whenever you choose to detox.",
