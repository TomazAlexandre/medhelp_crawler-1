            "answer": "OK, you ask very good questions and I'll try to sum it up for you. Here are the glucose levels to aim for:Prandial [before a meal] 60-99 mg/dlPostprandial [2-3 hours after a meal] less than 141 mg/dl, ideal is below 121 mg/dl.If your prandial falls between 100-125 mg/dl you are considered prediabetic. Above 126 mg/dl, diabetes.These are the best times to test. Prandial provides you with a baseline to see how the foods you ate [postprandial] affect your glucose levels.Also, testing prior to bed will give you a good baseline to determine what\u2019s going on in your body overnight. Most people\u2019s blood glucose will fall throughout the night or remain steady. Measure against your morning prandial.Changing lifestyle habits can go a long way too. Restrict & avoid refined sugars, avoid bad carbs, practice and adhere to weight control, do some sort of exercise daily, practice stress management, and get adequate sleep. These along with proper nutrition and physical activity are important.Lastly, get online and educate yourself on diabetes, diabetes control and management.

            "answer": "Careful with dry cereal as almost all contain tons of added sugar [see ingredient label]. Every 7 grams listed equals one heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar. And, when you add milk you add more sugar. This is why I stopped eating cereal.Now I make my own granola and eat it with plain no-sugar yogurt sweetened w/Splenda. Oatmeal is my other favorite with cinnamon.",
