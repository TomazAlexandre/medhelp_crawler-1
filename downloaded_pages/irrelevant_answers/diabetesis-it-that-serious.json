            "answer": "hey.. yeah that does sound like type one. I hope you talk to your mom about it and go see a doctor. It's really important that you see the doctor, because then if it is type one you can on your insulin regimen as fast as possible; having high blood sugar isn't safe.it's a big life change, i know you must be so afraid. I'm glad you came on here, there's lots of people you can talk to about it, any frustrations or questions will be answered.I've had type one for almost two years now. when i was first diagnosed i really took care of it, managed it well and everything. but then, i started to slip, had seperate problems with depression and drugs and stuff... but i came through it. i still have struggles, but diabetes will NOT control your life. it may seem like it at first, but you can have control over it.if you ever need to talk, send me a pm. i hope i can help.you'll have lots of support on this site, keep posting!good luck to you",
