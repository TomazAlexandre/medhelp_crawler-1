            "answer": "Chromium. A trace element that plays a role in blood sugar regulation, chromium works with insulin to help transport glucose into cells. Take up to 1,000 micrograms of \"GTF\" chromium daily.Alpha-lipoic acid. This antioxidant can enhance glucose uptake, inhibit glycation (a sugar-protein link that can damage small blood vessels), and help promote and maintain eye health. Start with 100 mg a day.Coenzyme Q10 is a powerful antioxidant which may help maintain a healthy heart. Take 60-100 mg in a soft gel form with your largest meal.Exercise improves the action of insulin, moving glucose out of the bloodstream and into tissues where it can be used for energy.Maintain a healthy weight. If you are overweight, the more pounds you lose, the lower your chances of developing diabetes.Several small studies have linked cinnamon to better blood sugar levels. Some of this work shows it may curb blood sugar by lowering insulin resistance.In one study, volunteers ate from 1 to 6 grams of cinnamon for 40 days. (One gram of ground cinnamon is about half a teaspoon.) The researchers found that cinnamon cut cholesterol by about 18% and blood sugar levels by 24%. If you do try the cinnamon I suggest the brand Gia cinnamon BarkIt's a capsule any health food store should have it!http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/01/07/diabetes-remission.aspx?e_cid=20130107_DNL_art_1http://www.mercola.com/nutritionplan/index.htmBefore doing anything get the OK from your Dr.",
