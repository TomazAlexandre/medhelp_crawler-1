            "answer": "Hi!! The exact same thing happened to me yesterday!! I was borderline gestational diabetes with my first child so I was thrilled at the news that those numbers were ok. The iron level helps explain why I haven't been able to pick my head up off the pillow so that was really some good news too!! My doctor wanted me to get slow fe iron pills, there is just one mg dosage and you only take one per day so that is the kind they told me to get. Good Luck!! Ginger",

Hopefully these tabs will do the trick for both of us.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and happy new year.Shannon",

Any recommendations on brands or are they all basically the same? I am taking prenatals too and have been throughout the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks and Happy New Year.",
