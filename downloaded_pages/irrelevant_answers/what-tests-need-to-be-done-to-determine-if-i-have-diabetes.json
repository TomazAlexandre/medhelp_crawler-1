            "answer": "You've had 3 doctors say the same thing (using different words).\u00a0\u00a0The most informative way of saying it was that you're pre-diabetic (a red flag which should be interpreted as something you can address now if you choose, and before it becomes testing within the range of officially having diabetes).Your fasting urine sugar content is often the classic test result that really grabs a doctor's attention and I think that value carries the most weight.\u00a0\u00a0To you know your test result and how close it is the outside of the normal range? (usually that's clearly stated beside your test result on lab test reports, and often circled or marked when a result is outside the normally healthy range).\u00a0\u00a0There are also tests less commonly used, such as how well your adrenal glands can handle supervised glucose consumption.Often dodging the bullet comes down to the early choice (better sooner than later) of losing a few pounds through healthier food choices and quantities, being more active (not exercise necessarily at all, merely less sedentary -- lots more walking than riding/driving, stairs instead of elevators, standing replacing some of your sitting time, seeking out bits of activity rather than avoiding it, that sort of thing).",

    "question": "For the past year, I've seen numerous doctors for different health concerns. But the question that I hear a lot is \"are you diabetic?\" I had an obgyn tell me I'm Pre-Diabetic. The next 2 doctors said I am not diabetic.Both my mother and her mother (my grandmother) have diabetes type 2.Anyway, I'm wondering if there's a specific test (ex: blood work, urinalysis, etc.) that could give me a simple yes or no answer.Thanks in advance!",
