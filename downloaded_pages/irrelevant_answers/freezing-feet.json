            "answer": "Hi Wendy,Welcome.Your mom is fortunate to have your love and concern. You sound like a wonderfully caring daughter.\"Freezing feet\" is a frequent complaint and issue with seniors, especially those that are diabetic. The major issues is circulatory due to the aging process and often compounded by diabetic neuropathy.It's important that your mom is taking all prescribed medications to treat her diabetes. keeping as active as possible will help with circulation. Using heating pads are not advised due to usually to the lack of sensation. Often ppl with reduced circulation cannot tell when something is too hot and risk burns. However the old warm hot water bottle can when be used if the water temperature is tested before filling to avoid burns.Several non-restrictive layers on the lower extremities can also be beneficial. Applying warmed blankets or similar smaller items can help ease \"freezing feet.\"Last but not least be sure to discuss this condition with her PCP.\u00a0\u00a0There are some medication that will help with circulation if she isn't already on one or if she is a candidate for them.My mom, a diabetic also sufferers from the same freezing feelings and indeed her feet and lower extremities are often cold to the touch. A heavy, non-skid booties over silk- like ankle socks often provides her some relief.\u00a0\u00a0Be cautious as the silk-like ankle socks are very slippery and should never be used alone when ambulating. Just a silk long johns help maintain body temperature and retain it...so do socks.Please excuse my tardy response. I hope my suggestions have been helpful and that your mom can find a solution to the uncomfortableness of cold extremitiesMy Best to Both,~Tuck",
