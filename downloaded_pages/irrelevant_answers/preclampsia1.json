    "question": "Any of you ladies had it? If so how'd you find out and what did doctor do? I'm 36w baby#4 first boy. And went to have a glucose test last week and all of a sudden this week I'm getting calls from nurses saying that there's lots of\u00a0\u00a0protein in my urine. I have really high blood pressure and my iron is extremely low. And it's possible that I have gestational diabetes. Now thisis baby #4 and none of this stuff has ever happened to me. So I'll be in the hospital all day tomorrow getting tests done.",
