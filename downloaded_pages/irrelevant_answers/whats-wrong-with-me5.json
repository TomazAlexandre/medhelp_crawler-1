            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Tying of tubes by itself will not cause loss of appetite, dizziness etc. This could be due to either some infection or due to hormonal changes as in polycystic disease, hypo or hyperthyroidism or due to postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, hormone assessment, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required. Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor and get the required investigations done.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
