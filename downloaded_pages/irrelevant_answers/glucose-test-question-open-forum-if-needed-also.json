            "answer": "No, drinking water doesn't have anything to do with it. It is the insulin receptors that sometimes get \"screwed up\" with pregnancy. They don't always notice the glucose during pregnancy. If taken care of this is usually self limiting and will disappear after delivery. However, if uncontrolled, it can predispose you to diabetes. Usually dr will hand out a sheet of foods to avoid, especially fast food and of course high sugar foods. You may gain a little more weight than normal with higher sugars and the baby can weigh more. The hospital will also do a blood test to make sure that the baby doesn't get LOW blood sugar. This may seem confusing, but bc the baby is used to the higher blood sugar levels in your blood, when they are born they pump out a lot of insulin and have a chance of getting HYPOgylcemic(low blood sugar). The hospital will give you a bottle of sugar water d5w or d10w to give them to bring it up. Best wishes and it sounds like you will follow the plan to a \"t\" and be just fine afterwards.",

    "question": "So I just had my glucose test and I failed =( so I have to go Monday for the 3 hour test.If you don't drink enough water can that cause you to fail? It was early in the morning, so I didn't have any water, does it mean I'm eating to much sugar? The most sugar I eat is what is natural in fruit, and I do put a little on my malt o meal.By failing this one does it mean I'm doing something wrong?",
