            "answer": "His life outcome could be good or it could be bad, people that monitor their problems and take great care of themelves are sometimes outlived by those such as your BF who doesnt, there are other factors that come into play such as genetics.\u00a0\u00a0I just hope he knows that the path he is on is not a good one and he stands of chance of a painful outcome, as organs shutdown due to high BS he will be past the point of no return. He stands a higher chance of being without one of his limbs and eyesight as a result of such actions.\u00a0\u00a0So he could live to a ripe old age, but be completely unable to take care of himself if he continues with his actions.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to him and maybe others that are involved in his life and see if you cant find a way to drill such information into him, so that he understands the potential consequences of such foolish behavior.",

            "answer": "He has a good understanding of what can/will happen if not taken care of now, that's why I've been so perplexed as to why he simply wouldn't do it....BUT - great news!\u00a0\u00a0We had a long talk late last night...and for some reason the talk made a difference this time (we've had many talks regarding it before and it hadn't done any good)\u00a0\u00a0He put his pump/pod back on after months of not treating his Type 1 (or even testing to see where his sugar levels were) and last night he was at 382, but by this morning he had it down to 119 - so, I'm praying that he will continue to take care of this and work on adjusting his insulin levels as necessary and monitoring.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your reply :)",

    "question": "My boyfriend was diagnosed with Type one diabetes a few years ago.\u00a0\u00a0(He is now 36)\u00a0\u00a0In the past year and a half - I have watched him let it become out of control.\u00a0\u00a0i.e. - not monitoring his levels, not taking his insulin, not limiting his sugar and carbs in his diet...\u00a0\u00a0I'm very concerned.\u00a0\u00a0In the reading I've done - it appears as though even with someone \"tight controlling\" their type 1 - the life expectancy can be shortened by 10 to even 20 years.\u00a0\u00a0but without any control over it...\u00a0\u00a0I'm worried that this could progress very rapidly.\u00a0\u00a0Any insight to life expectancy of someone NOT managing their Type 1??\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if he is just choosing to ignore the seriousness of the matter, or if he has just resigned to the fact that this will be what ends his life...\u00a0\u00a0any info would be greatly appreciated",
