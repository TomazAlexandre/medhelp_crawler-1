            "answer": "It can be controlled with the proper diet, but it won't go away. Depends on how bad it is, you may need medication to control it. Has your doctor made an appt. to discuss with you? Usually they'll set you up with a nutritionist to discuss ways to control it with diet. I didn't have it with my first, but I go next week for my test, pretty nervous! Babies tend to be bigger with gestational diabetes, I would make sure you ask your doctor all the questions you have about it.",

            "answer": "You should ask to be referred to a dietician. They help a lot! I have to do a 2nd 3 hour glucose test next week because I was borderline on my results. And you did NOTHING to cause it! It has to do with hormonal reaction between your placenta and insulin resistance. Also you can be genetically predisposed to getting it.",

            "answer": "I have it. I did not have it with my first son it should go away after the baby is born but from what I was told you are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later so far I have been able to control mine with diet your doctor should set you up with a nutritionist who will show you how to check your blood sugar and help explain what you can eat. They limit the amount of carbs that you can eat which is what turns into sugar that your body can't process it's a lot of work checking everything that you eat but will be worth it if you can control it thru diet. You are more likely to have a larger baby tho at my 36 week u/s bubs was measuring 7lbs 3oz. I am not sure of other complications as I've been able to control my sugars other than having a larger baby hope this helps :-)",
