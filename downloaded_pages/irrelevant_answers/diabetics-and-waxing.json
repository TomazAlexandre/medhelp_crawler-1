            "answer": "This is a new question for us! I did some research and found only one link to a website that addresses this warning:http://www.diabetes123.com/dteam/2004-05/d_0d_c4t.htmThe danger appears to be for those folks who have neuropathy and who cannot tell if the wax is too hot and therefore may risk burning themselves. Many people do not KNOW that they have neuropathy until something like this happens. So as the person on the website I gave you said, use common sense and caution if you decide to use waxing products.",

I get a great deal of stress with facial hair, especially around the mouth chin lip area. If i went for bleaching is that any safer? I am a blond, but some of my hairs are extremely course white or black, or fine long and curly. I am so gutted and frustrated, i am 52, and so annoyed @ this illness. But want to remain a women, without the fear of a beard, which looks very likely.Susan Ashby",
