            "answer": "Are you a Diabetic? it could be diabetes,The sensation of tingling in hands can be caused by numerous factors. The National Institute of Health begins by listing the most obvious ones like standing still or sitting for long periods of time which decrease circulation. Peripheral Neuropathy or nerve injury and/or damage can cause a tingling sensation in one or both hands. Nerve damage can result from a build up of toxins in the body and illnesses such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, seizures and stroke. Pressure to the spinal nerves, such as that from a herniated disk, can also be a cause. Lack of blood supply to the area resulting from frost bite or even cholesterol build up can be factors too. The National Institute of Health also lists certain viruses like shingles and herpes zoster infections as reasons why we might be experiencing this sensation.Certain medications and even treatments for cancer like radiation therapy produce the sensation of tingling and numbness because they can damage and compress nerves. Deficiencies in certain vitamins and minerals in our bodies like Vitamin C, Vitamin B6 and Potassium can also produce the effect.The Mayo Clinic reminds us that one of the most common reasons behind the tingling sensation in hands is Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. The Carpal Tunnel is a passageway on the palm side of our wrists that protects the main nerve and tendons in our hands. The tunnel is narrow so any swelling that occurs in it puts pressure on the nerve causing numbness, pain, tingling and even nerve damage. Carpal Tunnel Syndrome is most frequently caused by repetitive motion in the hand or wrist such as typing on a computer or playing tennis or handball.What Can I Do to Reduce or Stop the Tingling Sensation?As with any possible symptom of an underlying condition, the first thing to do is to consult your medical practitioner. Even if you have been diagnosed with a particular condition causing the tingling sensation, it is also advisable to consult with your medical practitioner before embarking on a course of home remedy.Studies show that there are numerous natural ways which might just well reduce, if not eliminate, that tingling sensation from our hands. Here are the Top 10 such natural remedies for tingling hands:1. Vitamin B12A 1997 study carried out by Portland Hand Surgery and Rehabilitation Center in Oregon on 441 patients found that those with a higher intake of Vitamin B6 had fewer symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, including hand tingling. Vitamin B can be taken in capsule form or in natural sources like poultry and fruits such as bananas and mangoes.2. Vitamin CThe same 1997 Oregon study found that Vitamin C can also help reduce symptoms of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Vitamin C in supplement or natural form in citrus fruits, liver and even broccoli can help prevent the loss of cartilage in the joints of the hand.3. Omega 3 fatty acidsA 2005 Italian study found that Omega 3 fatty acids, particularly in conjunction with vitamins A, C, and E and selenium, help to reduce the joint inflammation that can lead to the tingling sensation in hands. Omega 3 fatty acids are found in high levels in fish and nuts, says the United States Department of Agriculture.4. PotassiumA 2005 study carried out by The Mayo Clinic in conjunction with the University of Hong Kong found that potassium is vasoactive or that it stimulates the vascular bed into increasing blood flow and improving overall circulation. This can help promote healthy joints and reduce the risk of inflammation that can cause hand tingles and even pain and numbness. Potassium can be taken in supplement form or in natural sources like potatoes and bananas according to the United States Department of Agriculture.5. Cat\u2019s ClawA 2007 study carried out by The School of Nursing at University of North Carolina at Charlotte, revealed that Cat\u2019s Claw plant can help reduce the inflammation of tendons associated with arthritis, osteoarthritis, diabetes and carpal tunnel syndrome that can lead to discomfort in hands. Cat\u2019s Claw extract can be taken in tincture, capsule and tea form.6. Chondroitin SulfateA 2009 study carried out jointly by researchers in Russia and Germany found that one of the body\u2019s natural sugars, Chondroitin Sulfate, is a major constituent of articular cartilage and is an important element in healthy and flexible joints. In his 2004 book The Arthritis Cure, Dr Jason Theodosakis named Chondroitin Sulfate as effective in reducing the effects of the osteoarthritis, including hand tingling. Chondrotin Sulfate can be taken in supplement form.7. ArnicaA 2002 British study discovered that arnica, a member of the sunflower family, generally used to reduce swelling, is also an effective form of pain relief for joint discomfort associated with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. Arnica can be taken in tincture form.8. AcupunctureA 1997 National Institute of Health consensus statement on acupuncture stated that acupuncture was a promising method for countering the effects of Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. However, it did conclude that further studies would be required to develop this theory.9. YogaA 1998 study undertaken by the University of Pennsylvania Medical School found that yoga, when practiced as little as twice a week, could improve hand strength and circulation in patients with Carpal Tunnel Syndrome as well as reducing symptoms.10. Regular exerciseA 2007 Canadian study found that regular exercise including aerobic activities like walking, swimming and biking and even weight training can help control blood sugar levels in diabetics and can help reduce symptoms of the condition, which include hand tingling.",
