            "answer": "Thanks for feedback on this,\u00a0\u00a0I wish there is a food product, herb, or whatever that would improve my visual faculty,\u00a0\u00a0My biggest issues for the last 5-8 years was my good eye blanking out for a fraction of a second and the only picture you get is with the other eye which is in a different gaze which makes your heart stop when your talking to someone.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is a product of my 1 year throw at vision therapy in '95-'96. I don't seem to get that anymore to much and also I have bad days where I don't see real clear. If I don't see clear it will make for a hard day at work.\u00a0\u00a0More anxiousness.\u00a0\u00a0That started after vision therapy I believe also but it might of been an age thing also,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I picked up a line on the eye chart with my amblyopic eye, but still only 20/80 on a good day.The shutting off and coming on in the good eye has faded away this past year.\u00a0\u00a0I did wear a prism (fresnal 17 diop.) the last March- July '10 in the amblyopic eye for about 4 months, That seemed to give me more confindence and my looking at someone and talking seemed quite a bit better , more fluid, and not so spacy and broken up.\u00a0\u00a0Funny how the visual can make it tougher to listen and concentrate.\u00a0\u00a0 With the prism though I had good days and bad days and I was a little conscienous about the look of the prism and with all the different light refracting off the back side.\u00a0\u00a0I think from what I gained was not strong enough to the neg. side of the cosmetic part and light interference.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Is there a food, or herb that might keep me from dipping into poor acuity days.MURKEL",

My husband, who is 72, has been on this regimen (along with a multi vitamin and mineral) for 15 years. His eyeglass prescription has not changed in all that time.

    "question": "I have a question about my vision. IS there no hope for my lack of visual comfort.\u00a0\u00a0I just went to the optometrist and had my vision measured.\u00a0\u00a0I am R+ 4.50\u00a0\u00a0 w/2.50 add read, and L + 4.75 in\u00a0\u00a0w/ 2.50 add for reading. He only added +.50 to right eye in both read and distance, and only added +.50 for read in Left lense.\u00a0\u00a0I used to be R+4.00 w.2.00 read......L+4.75 w2.00 read.I have diplopia and this added change creates poor distance sight in good right eye and causes my turned out left eye, approx. 15 dioptors, to put two different images on top each other more noticable. I used to be where eyes turned in and at adult stage I had surgery on good right eye which straightened my eyes comestically but now my eye is a tad overcorrected and my brain\u00a0\u00a0has many issues with this mixed up imagery.\u00a0\u00a0Especially for the first 20 years after surgery.\u00a0\u00a0So now I went back to my old perscription cause it is the better of the two evils.\u00a0\u00a0I would rather have a little more eye strain sometimes than the wierdness and awkwardness of overlapping images that can give me a vertigo, walking with odd cordination through crowded areas.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I wore a prism for 3 months to bring my vision together. It worked a lot of the times for larger images as far as putting things together and not at all in the reading department . I didn't like the glare I got off the prisim when I was in a darker setting and outdoor light was refracting of the back side of the fresnel prism basically blocking me from temporary looking through the lens. So I removed it about five months ago..\u00a0\u00a0I only see about 20/80 at best in left eye.\u00a0\u00a0Why do I have to suffer so many years. I seemed to struggle with my brain to try to put things together without the prism now-a days and then want nothing to do with trying to keep them together cause I have to consciously force it a lot of the times .\u00a0\u00a0My brain never gets a chance to relax.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Murkel",
