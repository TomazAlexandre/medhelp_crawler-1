Have you made sure you have the right code tab in your meter for the strips you are using, and have you used control solution to make sure it is working correctly? If you keep getting that reading without any numbers after you've done all that, I would call your doctor.How do you feel? Are you familiar with how you feel when you are high? Are you thirsty? Peeing a lot? Extra tired? Don't panic, just contact your doctor and follow his/her instructions.",

            "answer": "You are the only one who has told me what HIGH on a glucose monitor reads. You see my son's reading read \"HIGH\" at the doctor's office, then 3 hours later I checked his sugar level again and it still would not give me a number. It continued to read \"HIGH\" till the next afternoon when it read 375. My son just found out he is diabetic. I was so worried because the doctor sent him home without any medications or insulin for his diabetes. I think the doctor should have done an A1C to get a number if they couldn't get a reading. He is also sick with bronchitus which is why he went to the doctor in the first place. The only reason they checked his sugar was because he has been urinating on the hour, his mouth very dry, and feeling very, very weak and I am also diabetic. However, I was disappointed in the doctor. If my son hadn't gotten a reading I would have taken him to ER or another doctor, which I still might do. Thanks for your input.\u00a0\u00a0Pink",
