    "question": "My problem is in regards to Sexual dysfunction from past 8 - 9 years. This may be because of excessive masturbations from young age age 15 to 32 ( Presently 40 ). My depression levels are so high that I just cannot make a proper eye contact with anyone. My eye balls fall directly on pvt parts of ladies or men. It is very embarrassing. I love to have sex but i often am afraid as the recurrence of depression levels increases drastically.I just cannot socialize and things are not improving even after following all types of medications from Ayureveda to Homeopathy and Flunil 10 / 20. Semen levels and quality is very low on me. Even a little discharge and I see the depression effect immediately in 2 hrs.max.",
