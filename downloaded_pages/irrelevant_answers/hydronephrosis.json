            "answer": "Hi,Your current urine protein and creatinine levels are within normal range, so this is a good sign. The solitary kidney may explain the hypertension. In the case of a solitary kidney,the kidney actually compensates. It is important that blood pressure has to be monitored and maintained to decrease kidney workload. In this way, one prevents further development of the hydronephrosis. The hydronephrosis may be due to an increased volume load. A condition that may be present in solitary kidneys.It is of great priority to save the kidney. Surgery is only an option when the underlying condition is really severe eg a complete ureteral obstruction. Even then kidney tissues are to be spared as much as possible.In your case, your laboratory results appear to be within normal range and you seemed to be managed well.Do you have other illnesses like diabetes?Just continue with your maintenance medications and maintain close contact and follow up with your physician. Some medications may not be very good for the kidneys, so in cases such as these ,it is wise to be managed conservatively.",

            "answer": "Hi,At this point, you are asymptomatic and your other tests came back unremarkable. Also, it is necessary to point out that your blood pressure level is well controlled. This is a good sign.Conservative management is the mainstay here. I do not think there is further intervention needed. You have only one kidney and as I have mentioned it is always important to spare nephrons (kidney units)from any further damage by decreasing its work load thus, the close watch on blood pressure levels. Continue a healthy lifestyle and stick to your diet . Keep a close and open communication with your physician. I believe that you are being properly managed.",
