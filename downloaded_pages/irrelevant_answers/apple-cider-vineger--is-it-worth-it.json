            "answer": "Diabetes results when the body is no longer able to properly process blood glucose. A daily tonic of apple cider vinegar can supply pectin, a water-soluble fiber good for helping to regulate glucose levels. Since many diabetes sufferers have impaired digestive functions, apple cider vinegar can also help restoregood digestion and nutrient absorption.I also suggest buying the book Grain Brain by David Perlmutter MD",

            "answer": "How much pectin is in the vinegar?\u00a0\u00a0There's a lot in apples, but how much fiber is left in the vinegar?\u00a0\u00a0And is pectin any better than other water soluble fibers in reducing blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0My guess is, there's not enough fiber left in vinegar as opposed to whole apples for this to be the reason, if any, that apple cider vinegar would lower blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I would think a whole change in diet would have to be undertaken to see an effect, not just taking the limited amount of vinegar a person can healthfully take in every day, which isn't all that much.\u00a0\u00a0I would guess one apple would provide a whole lot more pectin if that's the key.\u00a0\u00a0Just my thoughts.",

            "answer": "According to latest scientific studies, vinegar reduces the rise of blood sugar levels after you have eaten a meal and when taken at bed time, vinegar lowers morning blood sugar levels. The vinegar tonic restricts the absorption of high-carbohydrate foods which lessens the blood sugar increase that usually happens after a meal.",

            "answer": "Does this also mean it restricts the absorption of the antioxidants and minerals in the food, meaning it will be excreted before these can be absorbed?\u00a0\u00a0In other words, does the use of apple cider vinegar, according to your analysis, promote cancer and autoimmune disorders by preventing the absorption of necessary protective nutrients?\u00a0\u00a0Remember, all vegetables are carbohydrates, and carbohydrate foods are the main sources of most of our nutrients other than fat and protein.\u00a0\u00a0And by the same token, if someone is taking medication, does it also prevent the absorption of that?\u00a0\u00a0Some herbs can do this, particularly those that treat digestive problems, and must be take apart from food and medications for this very reason.\u00a0\u00a0So are you creating another problem to treat blood sugar with this method?",
