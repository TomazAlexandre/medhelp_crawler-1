Spinal stenosis is one possible etiology.A potential problem is that if compression lasts long enough the nerve may atrophy.An MRI of the cervical spine should provide a definitive diagnosis.A x-ray is both innappropriate and meaningless.See an M.D. - not a chirpopractor.Treatment is generally intermittant axial traction and range-of-motion exercises.There is always the remote possibility of a growth, so an MRI is the best way to go.",
