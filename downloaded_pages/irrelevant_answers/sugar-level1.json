            "answer": "Here are the recommended levels:Fasting: 60/70 to 99 mg/dl = normal100 to 125 mg/dl = prediabetesPostprandial: 2-3 hrs after a meal should equal normal fasting levels.Type 2 diabetics aim for <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dlYour postprandial 142 mg/dl shows diabetes but is not an absolute indicator. You will need to ask your doctor for an A1c [HgbA1c, HbA1c] test to verify diabetes. Your results are presented in % [percentile]. You want between 4 and 5%. Not certain about India but elsewhere in the world A1c home test kits are available for consumer purchase at local pharmacies/drug store. Good luck -",

            "answer": "Actually, if you want to have 'excellent' blood sugar control that is as close to normal as possibel 142 is not acceptable.Considering that people without diabetes will rarely have readings higher than 100 ever.To avoid complications the best plan is to keep blood sugars as close to truely normal as possible.\u00a0\u00a0This will prevent complications.Your 142 is a wakeup call.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you are 'diagnosed' with diabetes or prediabetes or not,\u00a0\u00a0your sugar levels are abnormal and it is now your chance to do something about it.",
