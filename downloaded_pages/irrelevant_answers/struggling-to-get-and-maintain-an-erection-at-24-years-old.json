    "question": "For the past two weeks I've been having a very hard time getting a full erection, and when I do, I find it more difficult to maintain it.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't know what happened,\u00a0\u00a0I recently got a new girlfriend about 4 months ago, and we would have sex often, about 3-4 times a week, and sometimes this issue would crop up, but it would only last 3-5 days tops.\u00a0\u00a0Because its lasted so long, I had to make up a couple of excuses to avoid the issue with my GF, because I don't know how to even explain it.I normally am able to get an erection pretty quickly by just thinking about something that turns me on, or looking at an attractive woman and thinking about sex.\u00a0\u00a0Now, when I do those things, I feel myself getting erect, but a lot of times, when I'm at 40-50%, I feel a dullness in my crotch region as if I just had sex already and my body can get up and running again.\u00a0\u00a0I when I do get erect, if I don't use it right a way, it goes away a lot faster than normal too.Does anybody have any ideas why this is happening?",
