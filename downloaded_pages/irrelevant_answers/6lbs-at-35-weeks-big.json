    "question": "Got my growth check ultrasound today to see my baby girl. Found out she has hair and she's 6 lbs. Is that big for this far along? How can I calculate how much she'll weigh when she comes out. Im guessing7\u00a0\u00a01/2 to 8lbs? I'm wondering cause I have gestational diabetes and despite not finding out till 32 weeks she's only a week ahead thank god.\u00a0\u00a0But I'm wondering how big she is going to be. Seeing her face in 4d today was such a joyful moment. I teared up a bit. Getting sooo excited and anxious.\u00a0\u00a0Time is winding down now...",
