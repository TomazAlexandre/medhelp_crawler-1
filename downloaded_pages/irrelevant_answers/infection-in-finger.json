            "answer": "Thank you for visiting the Family Practice Forum.One of two things is happening here.Either you have a collection of blood (hematoma) that has collected underneath the skin where the hangnail was, or quite possibly you may have an infection. Pulling these hangnails out does provide a pathway for bacteria to get in underneath the nailbed and tissue around the nail. An infection such as this is called a \"cellulitis\".Cellulitis is a term used to describe an infection of the skin.\u00a0\u00a0Cellulitis may be present in the skin on any part of the body.\u00a0\u00a0Certain conditions/situations predispose one to developing cellulitis.\u00a0\u00a0These include diabetes, eczema, burns, swelling of the extremities (edema or lymphedema), poor circulation, burns, surgery,\u00a0\u00a0IV drug use or occupational exposure to skin irritants.\u00a0\u00a0With cellulitis, there is bacteria present which is causing the underlying symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0The type of bacteria present differs depending on the part of the body/skin affected.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms present with cellulitis include a generalized, confluent red rash which blanches with pressure, tenderness, swelling and occasionally drainage from the area involved. The area is warm and fever or chills are commonly present. The doctor may due a culture of the affected area to help determine the type of bacteria causing the cellulitis. Antibiotics are prescribed for a period of 10-14 days and in severe cases, hospitalization for IV antibiotics and surgical consultation may be necessary. I would suggest you have this looked at by a doctor.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your assistance.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the emergency room (couldn't get in to see my doctor) and they stated that it was a common occurrance and called it by a \"p\" name.\u00a0\u00a0I do have poor circulation and I was in a hotel for the conference when this incident occurred, so perhaps that accounts for the infection.The doctors cut my finger along the nailbed and got some pus out.\u00a0\u00a0I am on Kelflex for 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0When I remove the bandage and put new neosporin/bandage on, I have noticed that there is a white substance near the cut.\u00a0\u00a0Should I clean that out? Is it possible that that is more pus that should be removed?Thanks.",

    "question": "One and a half weeks ago, I (very uncharacteristically) pulled off a hangnail that was close to my nailbed and fairly deep.\u00a0\u00a0Now my finger has a pronounced purplish bump on it and is very hot to the touch.\u00a0\u00a0In the past week, it has gotten worse (bumpier, hotter, discolored) instead of better.\u00a0\u00a0Also it is painful when anything puts any pressure on that part of my finger.\u00a0\u00a0What's going on?\u00a0\u00a0I presume that I have an infection of some sort, but should I be concerned, take any steps, or see a doctor or is it too soon to be concerned?Thanks.",
