            "answer": "I have a long crease on my left lobe but not one at all on my right! I've wondered that more exposure to sun on the left side ( from driving) might have caused it but I've sure heard about the heart disease connection. I had the cardiac\u00a0\u00a0calcium CT scan 2 years ago and I scored a zero so I hope and pray I am heart disease free but the crease does worry me. Thanks for asking the question!",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,What is the current thinking on earlobe creases?\u00a0\u00a0Do Cardiologists use this marker during an exam?\u00a0\u00a0I am 39, female, and I have a long crease in my left ear and half crease in my right.\u00a0\u00a0I do have controlled cholesterol and blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I read some scary things on the internet about this topic, causing me to wonder if I already have or will develop CAD. I am terrified and depressed over this.\u00a0\u00a0I have never had a doctor ask me to see my earlobe, making me think that this must not be a very valuable tool.\u00a0\u00a0What do doctors think?\u00a0\u00a0The studies out there seem to be conflicting.Thank you much!",
