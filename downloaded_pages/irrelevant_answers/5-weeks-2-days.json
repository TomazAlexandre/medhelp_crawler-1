    "question": "Hey guys. I need some advice. I had an abdominal ultrasound at 5 weeks and 2 days. They seen the gestational sac and a tiny yolk sac. Unfortunately, there was no fetal pole or heartbeat. This is my fourth pregnancy and all my others are fine. This is the first time I have had an ultrasound this early. In June, I was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes and really scared that I may lose the baby. Is it normal to not have a heartbeat then? Thanks in advance! :)",
