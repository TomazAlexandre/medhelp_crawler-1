            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Nausea could be due to extreme fatigue. If you are also over weight, check out for diabetes and hypothyroidism. Severe anemia too causes water retention and weight gain. In women polycystic disease of the ovary too should be ruled out as it causes insulin resistance and fatigue.If you pass urine a lot and feeling very tired, diabetes and subclinical urinary tract infection should be ruled out. Other possibilities are hypothyroidism, anemia, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, poor sleep patterns, inadequate sleep, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Commonest cause of chronic nausea is acidity. Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
