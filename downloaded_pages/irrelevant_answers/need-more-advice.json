            "answer": "Sounds like you know what the results of that test will be. Once you are diagnosed I encourage you to learn as much as you can about diabetes and how to manage it. Some doctors give lots of direction and hook you up with a Diabetic Educator and some just give you a prescription and wish you luck. I encourage you to learn about diet and exercise and about what works to control your blood sugar. Everyone is different.When you say you \"have the hypoglycemia symptom\" what readings are you getting? If you are truly low (some say under 70, some under 60) you need to treat it, but you are probably overtreating it by eating lots of yummy sweats. I recommend you get some glucose tablets at the drug store and take the prescribed dose. If you are above 70, just go ahead and eat breakfast and your numbers should rise. Don't skip meals.",
