My results came back normal, however they said I'm anemic and have to start taking more iron. So now im taking 200% daily value of iron",

I didn't think the drink was that horrible but after 20 minutes or so got a decent headache and was definitely not feeling great. But I got to the lab, got my blood drawn and skipped on my Mary way.
