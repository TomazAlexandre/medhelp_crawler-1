            "answer": "Hi,How is your husband? I understand your concern regarding your husband's condition. There is no absolute contraindication for hemodialysis but there are some relative contraindications that his doctors may have considered. There are many possible factors to consider such as your husband's co-morbid conditions as well as his recent heart attack, symptoms and over-all health. It is highly recommended that you talk to his doctors for proper evaluation. Discuss the management plan also to erase any doubts. Take care and best regards.",

    "question": "My husband is 67 yrs old, congestive heart failure, insulin dependent diabetes, kidney failure (stage 4 or 5), and his latest test results were BUN 93, Creatinine 14, and GFR 11.\u00a0\u00a0 He recently had a minor heart attack and before doing an angiogram(which turned out fine except for two small blocked veins) the hospital put a port in his neck for possible dialysis.\u00a0\u00a0I am at my wits end because, for some reason he's not had any dialysis and I'm not sure why, and I don't believe we're getting enough information from the doctors.\u00a0\u00a0He feels terrible, weak, depressed, and miserable all the time and is unable to do much except sit in his chair.\u00a0\u00a0Can someone explain to me why doctors are so reluctant to start dialysis?\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if this will ultimately cause him harm.\u00a0\u00a0He does have good urine flow, which must be a factor.\u00a0\u00a0Why not do some dialysis to improve his life?\u00a0\u00a0I would really appreciate someone else's take on this situation.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you in advance, Gladys",
