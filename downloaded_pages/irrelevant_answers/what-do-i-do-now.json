            "answer": "I'm confused.\u00a0\u00a0Are you a diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0I looked up Metformin to see what it is and it says it's for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe it's used for something else, too?Regarding insurance--I would call your husband's human resources person to ask some questions (pose them hypothetically).\u00a0\u00a0Many insurance plans require a \"qualifying event\" to go on them if it's not during \"open enrollment\".\u00a0\u00a0A qualifying event are things like marriage, adoption, change in employment of spouse (if your spouse loses insurance, they can go on yours), etc.\u00a0\u00a0Also, there may be a preexisting condition clause that may exclude you from being covered for pregnancy if you go on it after you become pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0There may also be a preexisting condition clause if you have a lapse in coverage (you'll need to present a certificate of credible coverage proving that you did not have a lapse).\u00a0\u00a0Just some things to check into before assuming you can just get onto your husband's plan if you get pregnant.I would ask your doctor for guidance for you personally--especially if you're a diabetic and I'd also be very concerned about taking herbal supplements with prescription drugs (something else about which you should ask your doctor).",

            "answer": "I've been looking online for suggestions for you and so far have found Black Cohosh as a suggested use in regulating menses. Here's another one that I just found... Blue Cohosh root is taken for cramps and to start or regulate menses. It should not be taken if pregnant, unless you want to induce delivery. (It's said to promote a painless and rapid delivery.) I'm not sure what the difference in Black and Blue Cohosh is but I would suggest calling GNC or some place that sells natural herb/supplements. They could tell you for sure.",
