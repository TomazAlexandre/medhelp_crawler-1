They moved my due date ahead 6 days which puts it at February 4th and makes me 36 weeks today. I would have been 35 weeks yesterday. I just got diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes and my baby is nearly 10 lbs already. I am having a C-Section January 21st. I completely understand your worry. If it helps any at 30 weeks he was weighing almost 6 lbs. So he gained 5 lbs in a month. I blame my doctor because I passed my hour test and they made me take a 3 hour test at 33 weeks and I failed. Try not to stress.",

            "answer": "I blame my doctor for the fact that they saw my numbers were borderline for my glucose test that I took at 24 weeks. I feel that they should have caught that and had me take the 3 hour test then. If it would have been caught soon enough then I would have had the proper medication to control the issue and my baby wouldn't be nearly 10 lbs at 36 weeks. So I basically have gone maybe 2 and a half to 3 months without proper care. It's not like I knew I had Gestational Diabetes.",
