            "answer": "HiThanks for the post!Trigeminal neuralgia, Bell\u2019s palsy or paresis are the diagnosis that come to the mind. However there could be a pathology in the brain too and these could be TIA or transient ischemic attacks. We have a discussion on MedHelp for a similar problem which you can follow.http://www.medhelp.org/forums/neuro/messages/33809.htmlThe other possibility is eutascian tube infection or inflammation as in cold and flu. The eustachian tube extends from the middle ear to the top of throat. Pressure changes in this tube at times affect the flow of blood to tongue causing the tingling sensation. Facial numbness is felt even in accompanying sinusitis along with Eustachian tube block.High blood pressure, diabetes and thyroid problems should be ruled out and so also cervical spondylitis causing pressure on the nerves.This needs a more detailed investigation and probably you should consult your doctor and get yourself examined. You may need to undergo some tests too.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I too experience the facial numbness and tingling. It started about 2 years ago. It has now progressed from my face to my arms to my legs as of yesterday. I have had my thyroid tested before and it has come back low but then when they tested it again it came back normal. I often check my blood sugar and it's usually in the normal range. The tingling happened just about all day yesterday. I thought it was never going to end!",

    "question": "Three weeks ago, I started feeling some numbness & tingling on the right side of my lips & tongue. This lasted a few minutes & occured a few times through out the day. Then I noticed that when the numbness & tingling started a few days later, I was also having deep pain behind my right ear running down my jaw line. Then a few days later I noticed that when the numbness & tingling started, along with the ear discomfort, I felt some numbness & tingling going down my right arm into my hand. Now a new system has started. When the numbness & tingling starts in my face, it is all of my right face & sometimes I feel like I have a sore throat. Any ideas or suggestions?",
