            "answer": "If you have not done so I would strongly recommend getting tested for diabetes, thyroid problems, and maybe other metabolic conditions. Diabetes is actually what sticks out most in my mind because of the urination, fatigue, and bad breath. (And because it runs in my family like wild fire so I'm almost always thinking of it/ trying to prevent it.)AT the very least it sounds like you have inconstance and you should try working with a doctor to help limit that. I know that could be helped by having physical therapy (kegal exercises) that can be done and/or medication intervention as well. All those bathroom trips are certainly effecting your quality of sleep, but honestly I think they are just a symptom.",

    "question": "HiFor the past six years or so I am plagued with some flu like symptoms that will not go away. I get morning sweats; feel very tired not wanting to wake up. Normally my tummy makes rings. I sweat in the early morning hours that my sheets get socks wet and I feel very hot. I have shoulder joint aches that feel like a dislocation. My mouth has foul ordor and smell. Slight headache. I wake up to the bathroom five to six times a night to urinate.Hours into the day I start to sleazy and feel feverish. If I watch TV, read or attend a lecture I fall asleep with the first thirty minutes. Cannot focus.I have visited many GPs with no help at all. I feel better for two or so days after taking some home remedies like ginger, lemon, and garlic. Because I am always tired this impedes my exercise routine because I have no energy for it.Please help me out there",
