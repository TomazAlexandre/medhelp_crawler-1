            "answer": "If you notice a tired feeling - or seem fatigued - you could be heading into the numbers where your endo will start describing a thyroid med to start leveling you out. When do you see your endo for a blood test?I am glad you are feeling well right now. keep up with the water and candy's. Eat good. You may be one of the lucky one's that pull through this just fine. Really you are in day one going to two. Very early right now. Keep a journal on your symptoms each day and share that will your doctor at your visit coming up - he/she can tell then when you started to slide.Good Luck",

    "question": "30 hours after RAI and I dont feel anything yet. I mean I keep reading i'm not in the tough part of it yet, but I have had to deal with a thyroid problem for the past 4 years. I've tried almost everything even taking pills for anti-hyperactive pills. It worked and brought down my thyroid levels but my liver enzymes were too high to continue, so I was faced with two options.It came down to RAI or Surgery?-3 doctors recommended RAI since they said it had little side affects and it might be better in the long run.I went with RAI. Oh well, I guess I'm mad that I have auto immune disease but I can't control it.My mom has diabetes, and so I feel that could be worse to have than a thyroid issue. :OI've been drinking a lot of water, sucking on candies and just relaxing in my room. Is there anything to watch for or lookout for? Is the hardest part already behind me? I can see the light at the end of the tunnel.Thanks for your posts!By the way: I'm 18 year old male, I used to be a sports star til thyroid ruined my whole sports career in high school. I haven't been depressed but I've been close and I'm just trying to get over the humps of RAI.Thanks for your help!",
