    "question": "So I started exercising feb 18th monday-friday only and I walk 3 miles and about 2 days ago I started riding my bike. Since feb 18th I have lost about 10-12 pounds which I am really happy because hopefully I can control my diabetes and have a child when I'm healthy. On the 2nd of march I stared to bleed and thought I was getting my period but since then I have not bleed at all, I didn't even fill one regular tampon that evening. And I have had unprotected sex with my husband but I don't feel pregnant. Before the 2nd of march I did feel cramps for 3 days and I was PMS. My question is since I lost 10 pounds in about 2 weeks, would that have messed with my menstrual cycle? Please any advise will help me a lot. I do plan to take a pregnancy test within a week to rule out pregnancy.",
