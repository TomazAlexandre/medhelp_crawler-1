            "answer": "\"can a patient with low blood sugar levels, eat alot of sugar and glucose (i.e. glaxose-D) and eat bananas ?\"To raise glucose levels back to normal levels in an emergency glucose tablets found at your local drug store work best. But ask yourself why the low levels? You did something to cause it and you must try your hardest to prevent it from happening again. Having peaks - going from low to high or vice versa, especially rapid decline/incline - is very dangerous and hard on your cardio system. Bananas are high in potassium & sugar. An occasional one or two is OK but not for type 2 diabetics. To much potassium is just as bad as too little potassium. Both disrupt your heart rhythm. What is glaxose-D? A sugary snack?",
