            "answer": ".. Although I am still symptomatic of a condition called Extension oculomycosis a serious fungal eye infection peculiar to diabetics.]I also believe that my yeast infection triggered the auto immune response that caused my diabetic condition and in fact could be the cause of the Diabetes epidemic we are experiencing at the present time.The majority of people who have Candida do not realise they have it until become seriously ill. The symptoms are so numerous and seemingly unrelated that is very perplexing to all concerned.Candida Albicans in an incredible destroyer of health and is one of a number of pathogens that can infect without triggering the immune response they are aptly named",

            "answer": "I agree with you, about how hidden yeast infections (Candida albicans, etc.) can greatly harm the immune system.In my own case, I used to get yeast infections every time I used to take antibiotics. Now, I avoid antibiotics, unless it's a major emergency.For me, taking PRO-BIOTICS (such as ACIDOPHILUS & BIFIDUS)--beneficial bacteria-- has been the way to conquer yeast infections.Another thing I learned was that I had to give up using Tampax, because it incubated the yeast, and I could never get rid of the yeast fully, until I gave up using tampons.Also, eating too many sweets resulted in feeding the yeasts, so watching the sweet tooth also helped.Good luck with your new website! :-)Sincerely, Concerned ladyhttp://cantbreathesuspectvcd.com",

    "question": "Yeast infections are certainly not confined to people with AIDS or on chemotherapy. Dr Crook gives an estimate of 80 million infected in the USA alone .The main rout of infection is through taking antibiotics that deplete the natural bacterial gut flora allowing candida that is also part of our natural flora to proliferate to the point of being pathogenic [harm causing] .This is how I came to be infected. My many and seemingly unrelated symptoms were explained by a paper written by\u00a0\u00a0Dr Cranton .The following is part of my web site I",
