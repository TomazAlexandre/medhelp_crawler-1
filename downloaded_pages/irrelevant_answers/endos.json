Any idiot can look up what the ACTH tests. It tests to see if the primary cause is the reason for my low cortisol... it does NOT say I do not have low cortisol and need help. MORONS!",

After the baseline test they give you his horrible glop to drink ant then test your blood-sugar hourly. Normally the blood sugar rises. Mine fell and fell and fell (below 50) and only vaguely started to recover with the last test. A clear case of reactive hypoglycemia. The doctor looked over the test and assured me I did not have diabetes. Wow, wasn't that a surprise!I never went back to him again. Instead I bought Carlton Fredericks' book \"Low Blood Sugar and You.\" Much cheaper and I didn't have to get angry.",

But he is a good fellow and will answer my e-mails. Much of endocrinology is uncharted territory, and some results are achieved by trial and error. Also, since each person may have different reactions to treatment, what works for me may not work for you.",
