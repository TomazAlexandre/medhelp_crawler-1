            "answer": "Not only can a person have both MS and a neuropsychiatric disorder (eg. schizophrenia), but MS can occasionally show up with the first symptoms BEING a neuropsychiatric disorder.I believe that later onset schizophrenia is uncommon, but I am not sure.\u00a0\u00a0There are case reports of the onset of MS manifesting as the new onset of schizophrenia.MS is a disease of the whole brain INCLUDING the gray matter so it is quite possible to have either and both.If you need a source for this info let me know.\u00a0\u00a0I can show you reports that you could take to your doctors.Quix",

Most studies, lead to MS not figured out until 2 years after the fact. i have met many that the Dr's said you don't have it then two years later they found out even, ones same age and same result of MIR sults.

            "answer": "Hey, chica, one of my first symptoms was a weird sort of depersonalization disorder.\u00a0\u00a0It always happened when I was talking on the phone, so it must have had something to do with my visualization skills, perhaps my visual cortex.I thought for sure I was going insane... and then the other MS symptoms started.\u00a0\u00a0I've had so many weird things happen since then, but that was one of the weirdest.If he does have MS, then he's probably going through a bout of bad cog fog.\u00a0\u00a0I remember my first real exacerbation - I couldn't be trusted to do anything, and was a danger to myself and others.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't let myself drive, couldn't remember from one minute to the next what I was doing, or what was going on, couldn't remember people's names, or even the names of objects...Don't forget that a neuro is not qualified to diagnose a psychiatric disorder.",

            "answer": "Both my grandmother and uncle was diagnosed with schizophrenia. Both had paranoid delusions. My uncle was not the norm. He was diagnosed in late onset. They consider if you are past the age of 45 years of age it is late onset, but I believe that he had the illness a lot longer, and just \"self medicated\" until it didn't work anymore.They both did not suffer with any neurological symptoms, and my grandmother had a good MRI. My uncle didn't, and that was only because of several accidents that he had suffered. (He had head trauma and old scar tissue from that).During times when my uncle was having mental breaks with reality, he became very paranoid. He believed people were following him. He wanted my sister to call the FBI. He would become very angry if you would disbelieve the thought of this. He would see and hear things that were not there. The same is for my grandmother when she had problems.When he was put on medication to help his symptoms, he remembered his mental break and some of the things he saw, thought, and felt. He said it was like being on the best drugs to make you hallucinate, but you could never come off of.I agree with Jen, that a neuro can't diagnose Schizophrenia. If he has an abnormal MRI, take him to an MS specialist and see if they can help rather than a general neuro. If you feel that his mental state is not there...please take him to a really good Psychiatrist.I feel for you and your family. Schizophrenia is much deeper than forgetting things, at least from my personal experience with it.Take Care",

            "answer": "Hey all,My aunt was fist diagnosed with diabetes and then breast cancer which she appears to have beat (the cancer anyways diabetes not so much).She has now been diagnosed with MS for about the two years and has had the stereotypical symptoms that characterize MS (muscle weakness, fatigue, loss of controlled walking, bladder control, \"heat disability,\" demylenaited MRI). A second MRI has shown that her medication has appeared to halt the advance of the demylenation.However, over the last year it appears she has developed \"undifferentiated\" schizophrenia with many positive symptoms: auditory hallucinations,\u00a0\u00a0delusions, fear of persecution, She also appears to have some disorganized thinking.I believe the schizophrenia has developed due to the unimaginable stress she has been put under by her previous three ailments. Additionally, her use of medical cannabis could very well have contributed to the schizophrenia. She is on all kinds of drugs for the diabetes and MS I feel the antipsychotics will most likely be necessary but have any of you had luck with cognitive behavioral therapy, counseling, or just personal interaction that you could maybe give me some tips? I'm a very capable individual with a neuroscience, Integrative physiology, and crisis line background so I'm confident in my ability to make progress in this situation.",
