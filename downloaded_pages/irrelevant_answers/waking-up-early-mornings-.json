It's known that menopause in early stages cause sleep disorders, diabetes also can do that, don't know much about the the thyroid disorder but it can also contribute.I have also sleep disorders, and I found that a nap during the day help me to sleep better at night, believe or not... incredible. Try also night sleep tea, a glass of warm milk or in extreme case ask your doctor for Ambien CR, I take it and help me a lot, but be careful, can be habit forming and lose its capabilities.Good luck,Bob",
