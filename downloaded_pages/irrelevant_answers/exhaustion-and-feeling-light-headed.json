            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. If you are also over weight, check out for diabetes and hypothyroidism. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, poor sleep patterns, inadequate sleep, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium.\u00a0\u00a0At your age it can also be due to low estrogen and menopause. In women polycystic disease of the ovary too should be ruled out as it causes insulin resistance and fatigue. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "anemia is the main thing that comes to mind but I have friends with this and when they lay down it feels worse they say like the bed is spinning around them or a \"falling\" motion, also low blood pressure can cause this. I used to exert myself (work, sports,school, not enough sleep) without drinking enough water and feel the same symptoms.",
