    "question": "I am aware that you can not diagnosed over the internet.\u00a0\u00a0My request is for you to give me posible suggestions or internet addresses so that I can research my problem to tell my doctors what I have found.\u00a0\u00a0 I have had a medical problem for 4 years and though I have seen several doctors and have been checked for every disease imaginable the doctors are not able to diagnosed my problem.My symptoms usually happen after I eat sugar, fried foods or fatty foods.\u00a0\u00a0I feel extreemly nervous and after a couple hours my hands and feet hurt to the point where I can not do anything.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, I have found that when I feel this way and I exercise and increase my heart rate I tend to feel a little better.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not able to eat sweet fruits, bread containing 2g of sugar or even vegetable with high glycemic index like carrot, corn pumkin.\u00a0\u00a0This is just to give you the extent of my problem. My Dad recently came down with the same symptom...we live in different countires and ihave not seen him for 5 years.....Like me, he is not able to get diagnosed....\u00a0\u00a0Thank you very much",
