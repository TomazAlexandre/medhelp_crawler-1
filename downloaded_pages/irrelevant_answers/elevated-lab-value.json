            "answer": "I am very sorry to hear about all of the losses in your life.\u00a0\u00a0It must be very stressful and depressing.\u00a0\u00a0This can have a lot to do with the thyroid. Your TSH level indicates that your are\u00a0\u00a0hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you are seeing an endocrinologist since you also have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He will most likely be able to do the best job dealing with both the hypo and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0More than likely, he will Rx Synthroid or another form of thyroid replacement medication and have your blood tested every 4-6 weeks or hopefully sooner.\u00a0\u00a0He can then adjust the dosage of meds according to your TSH level.\u00a0\u00a0 I don't believe your heart problem has anything to do with your thyroid, but I am no doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You should make a list of questions to take with you to the doctor so you can have as much info on your condition as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure all\u00a0\u00a0your questions are answered to satisfaction so\u00a0\u00a0there is no doubt that you understand what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0You\u00a0\u00a0might be one of the lucky ones who just need to take the medication and be just fine in a few months.\u00a0\u00a0You don't mention having any symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0That is good.\u00a0\u00a0Just keep a positive outlook and don't worry.\u00a0\u00a0It only makes things worse.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0God Bless and Good luck.",

            "answer": "I would hope your endo put you on a thyroid medication after the blood count came back 18.79 - ifupleze is right . TSH is showing Hypothryroid.Being at your level your endo and cardiologist should be watching you closely. Did they run a cholestrol level check on you too?\u00a0\u00a0LDL and HDL needs to be stable and being hypothyroid will effect these numbers. That may not be good with your history of heart problems.HAving your diebetic disorder too will complicate thyroid medication also. SO proper blood test as ifupleze stated in important. - they may test you 4 to 6 weeks instead of the more common 6 to 8 weeks and rightfully so.I assume you are around your 50's too. I am sure your body is going through natural hormones changes as well and will cause a bump in the road for you too. Stress is not good on the auto immune system and to much of it will fry your curcuits. Easy said then done - with what you have been through and I am very sorry to hear of your situation. Are you on any other meds for anxiety - blood pressure - cholestrol - or estrogen?Try to rid the stress and I can't imagine you doing it alone. Seek a church group - or professional to just talk it out and take control of getting past what happened.",

            "answer": "Thank you both for your advice.\u00a0\u00a0I just feel lost...\u00a0\u00a0I will not see my doc for 9 days now so no I have not been put on anything.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think it is safe to wait that long?I have had increased symptoms of shortness of breath, flushing in my face, very very weak and tired all the time.\u00a0\u00a0My balance is off a little, vision changing some, and I can't concentrate too well.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know if this is due to the high TSH level, my other medical conditions or age.haWhy is it hypothryroid if the count is elevated.\u00a0\u00a0I can not find that answer in my reading.I am on Lipator for cholestrol but it has been ok. I am 58 and had a total hysterectomy in 1998 and have been on premarin but have been trying to wean off of it.\u00a0\u00a0I also take wellbutrin 300 mg daily for nerves, Toprol XL 200 mg daily,\u00a0\u00a0Avapro 150mg, Amiodarone 200mg daily, and Coumadin daily for my heart.\u00a0\u00a0I also take Metformin and Glyburide twice a day for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Also Neurontin for diabetic neuropathy in my feet.I do attend church and the people are a blessing.I hope I did not write too much but this is my first\u00a0\u00a0two times posting.",

            "answer": "I'm so sorry for all of your troubles.\u00a0\u00a0I can't address anything about your other illnesses or medications, but I can answer the question you asked about why, if you are hypothyroid, your TSH is high.TSH stands for thyroid stimulating hormone.\u00a0\u00a0It is produced by the pituitary gland.\u00a0\u00a0Basically it's the hormone that says \"hey, thyroid, do what you're supposed to do.\"\u00a0\u00a0 If your thyroid is not producing enough of it's own hormones, the pituitary gland tries that much harder to get the thyroid's attention by releasing more TSH.\u00a0\u00a0Sort of like saying, \"hey, thyroid, wake up, come on.\"\u00a0\u00a0 The less hormones your thyroid is releasing, the higher your TSH will be and vice versa.Hope this helps.",

Several of the drugs you are taking do not get along with thyroid hormone replacement drugs.Your insulin may need to be adjusted, and one or two of the others may need to be changed or discontinued.
