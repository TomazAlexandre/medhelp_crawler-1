    "question": "Last night my blood pressure and pulse got high.\u00a0\u00a0( sys: 175\u00a0\u00a0 dia: 144\u00a0\u00a0pules: 100 )\u00a0\u00a0 It went down after another dose of Enalapril, but my pules was up and down all night. My speech was weird ( i was pretty tired and hadn't slept in a while.) and my mouth was getting very dry. Laying down made my feel like my pulse was getting higher. For the past 3 days i have had bad diarrhea, which burns something awful and is mostly yellow liquid. The corners of my eyes have been hurting as well.\u00a0\u00a0A couple of hours before all this started i took 2 Diphenoxylate / A Tropline tablets.Also yesterday i was looking at a lake and all of a sudden i started seeing little flashing orbs about the size of a pen head.\u00a0\u00a0The flashing orbs went away after a minute but when i looked up at the sky i saw the same thing except the orbs where clear / non- flashing and where darting around.I have a 7 centimeter large ovarian cyst on my left ovary. A few days ago i went to the bath room and felt a sharp pain in that area. Usually i can feel the cyst if i feel the area but since that pain i haven't been able to find it.On another note my shoulders have been hurting, my mom thinks i may have a pinched nerve.Could the cyst have pooped and be causing some of this???Stats\u00a0\u00a0now: SYS: 108\u00a0\u00a0DIA: 53\u00a0\u00a0 PULSE: 100.I have type 2 diabetes, PCOS, High blood pressure, a sinus infection and a UTI.Regular meds. Metaformen, Yasmin, Enalapril and allegra.",
