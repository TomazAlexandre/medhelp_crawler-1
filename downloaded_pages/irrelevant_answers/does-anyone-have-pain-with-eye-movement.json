            "answer": "I have a friend at work that thinks her boyfriend has Fibro. He was tested for Lupus and that came back negative. He was tested for diabetes, because he was drinking a lot also. It came back negative. He did not have a good blood test and his uric acid is very high. I told her to have him tested for gout or fibro. Dr. Paul Cheney responded to another one of my post and stated that fibro client have low uric acid. I am very curious now.",

            "answer": "Yes, to the eye pain with movement - it comes and goes though and is more intense sometimes than others. I just had a very severe \"bout\" about two weeks ago. It lasted for two weeks and my scalp hurt, as well. I thought it was optic neuritis, but after a head CT and a eye exam everything came up normal. It was weird, but a lot of stuff with fibro tends to be weird.I also go through bouts of excessive thirst. I don't have diabetes, though.",

            "answer": "Hi, I go through this often. My neck trigger points, (trp's) are very involved in my fibromyalgia.The last three days I have severe pain from my shoulders to my face. My eyes hurt with my vision worsened. My eyes burn something awful where eyedrops (bouch and lombe) give minimal relief. Plus sudden intense heat and sometimes dizziness with thirst occurs.One other area involved in the symptoms is the sinus/nasal passages.The reason for my collateral symptoms and I only speak for myself, is the knots/trp's\u00a0\u00a0in the neck area near the spine not only affect the nerves that work on the eyes, sinus, face, neck and head, these trigger points spread somewhat like wild fire to cause muscle pain on top of the nerve pain.The thirst is probably the neurological effect on the salivary glands and as for me goes away rather quickly.My Cardio dr. gave me a diuretic recently to take every day!\u00a0\u00a0Huge mistake!\u00a0\u00a0This exasperated these symptoms to where I was just about passing out plus I had muscle cramps in my legs.\u00a0\u00a0This he swore would never happen because it is a potassium retaining diuretic.\u00a0\u00a0Just a word of cautionI hope sharing my experience helps.",
