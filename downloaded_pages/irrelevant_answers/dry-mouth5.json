            "answer": "Hi!To treat the dry mouth you have to find the cause behind it. Dry mouth could be the side effect of any medication that you could be taking. It could be due to Sjogren\u2019s Syndrome but this will also cause dry eyes. GERD or reflux disease too can cause similar symptoms. A generalized dehydration too can cause these problems. Iron and vitamin deficiency, fungal infection, hypertension, diabetes, strokes and transient ischemic attacks, anemia, smoking all cause dry mouth. Poor oral hygiene is another cause. Nerve damage due to some trauma or surgery can be another cause.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Meanwhile eat healthy, drink plenty of fluids (soups, juices, water, etc), take anatcid gels and multivitamin pills and see if it makes a difference. Take care!",
