            "answer": "I contracted the virus a year ago from a partner who never showed any signs or symptoms of having any STI during our encounters (and if he knew, I was never informed), so I believe I contracted it from him through viral shedding.However, viral shedding varies in everyone. I have been with my current partner for 9 months (he is aware I carry the virus~he is clean), and we have had both protected and non-protected sex, and he has not contracted it.",

    "question": "So I'm a little confused about some transmission statistics I've read. I've read that the chance of transmitting the virus from a man to a woman is 8-11% yearly. I assume this is without an outbreak? And if you use a condom the risk drops by 30%, correct?So why is it that all the website and info I've been reading is saying that you can still transmit the virus without symptoms? I mean yes, there is still a chance, but it seems to be a very small chance based on the statistics. Why don't most sources acknowledge this?The fact that I got it also makes me wonder if those statistics about the low transmission rate are accurate because I had sex with the guy that gave it to me once, with a condom and i don't think he was having an outbreak (he claims he didn't know he had it). Am I just really unlucky? I also have diabetes and was getting a cold when we had sex, so maybe my immune system couldn't fight it off?",
