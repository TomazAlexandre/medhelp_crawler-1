    "question": "Has anyone else dealt with this?! Is it caused by diabetes?!I asked my dr yesterday about getting shaky between meals if it had been a few hours since i had eaten anything and her response was that it sounded like hypoglycemia..she told me to stay away from sugar, sweets, fruit juices, cokes, etc. And to eat something high protein every 2 hours.Isnt this what they tell you when you are diabetic? And is there anything i can use for sweetener that will be ok?!",
