            "answer": "You still have a week and a half to go...that's plenty of time for things to progress!!! I suggest sex every night (if you are comfortable with it), walking every day to get baby low and put pressure on cervix, bouncing/swaying on an exercise ball, and evening primrose oil if you have some. Also, don't stress. Being stressed naturally slows things down so try to relax...take a nice bath/shower before bed, meditate, etc. Best of Luck!!!",

My second bub was 12 days late & I had gestational diabetes, most dr's would have induced but that's not what I wanted & I was measuring fine, was being monitored & bubs was fine so there was no reason to.",

    "question": "Ok I was wondering if you get induced (medically not naturally) what are the chances you will gave to get a c section? I've heard of a lot of people having to have a c section when they got induced...I'm 38 weeks 3 days and 2 days ago I went to the hospital (for gas pains of all things) and I'm not even 1 centimeter dilated and 2 weeks ago when they checked I was half a centimeter so I'm not moving very fast so I'm worried I'll have to be induced and I really didn't want a c section.",
