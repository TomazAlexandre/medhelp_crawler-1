You did not state whether your son wears a medical alert id of any kind.\u00a0\u00a0This small little necklace or bracelet, might have helped, as the police would have know that it was a medical conditions, and not assault.\u00a0\u00a0They can say several things on them. I personally have one that lists several medical allergies, and the meds I take.\u00a0\u00a0 MY daughter has one that she never takes off.\u00a0\u00a0Medical personal and the police are trained that when a person is having a seizure to look for them.I would also suggest talking to your son",

            "answer": "Paris47,You son needs to get his insulin regulated.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds as if he does not feel low blood sugars.I have the same problem of not feeling LOWS and it can lead to some very stupid things I do that is not understood by people that does not know what is going on.Get you son to the DR I hope he is seeing an Endo.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like he is taking too much insulin or not eating enough food for his snacks or both.He should also check his blood sugars on a regular basis.\u00a0\u00a0After I started checking my Blood sugars regularly, I still have LOWS, but now I have time to eat something before it gets so LOW that the rescue squad has to show up and I can't help myself.I once got so LOW that my wife gave me orange juice to drink, but I denied to her I was LOW and knocked the juice out of her hand and all over my hands.\u00a0\u00a0When she called the rescue squad, they took a blood sugar and said it was high and not low because of all of the OJ on my hands (they thought I was having some other type of siezure).\u00a0\u00a0I ended up fighting 4 Firemen and 2 Policemen until they had me strapped to a gurney (in my mind I was fighting Pirates).\u00a0\u00a0At the hospital the Dr took blood from my vein and sent it to the lab and found out I was LOW. They gave me Glucose and I came back to life as I had Passed Out.Not feeling LOWS is very dangerous, Your son can die if left in that state too long or he can get some serious brain damage as the brain cells start dying without enough sugar to feed them.Get him to a DR and get his blood sugar under control and have him test himself 4 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0If he wants to live he will have to do this as there will be 1 time when no one is around to help him and He can't help himself in this state of being.Also have him check his Blood sugar before going to bed, as the \"DEAD IN BED\" syndrome is very true for people who can't feel the LOWS, do a web search for \"dead in bed\".\u00a0\u00a0It would be a shame to lose your son to a LOW when a snack could have saved his life.I take the LOWS very serious as they can and will Kill Diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0My son had a friend who died of this, but on the death certificate they listed cause of death \"natural causes\" because he was a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0It is better to have high blood sugars and die 10 years earlier than you should, than to DIE TODAY of a LOW BLOOD SUGAR.Sorry this is so long, but it needed to be addressed.Bob",

My son's other problemsis my son's mental health status withremembering what to do, did he do it, and to continue to cooperate & to work together.He gets frustrated, feels it's not working, thenover reacts...He is seeing many drs, therapist, endo's family phy & a psykis doing better,but then the next day, not so good, his stress levelcan cause him to go 'low'.I wonder if in your area, did you get arrested for the'fight with the pirates',not trying to be funny, I am serious, I am concerned thatthe police are not educated, I am not 'bashing' policeI believe they need to do what they do to protectothers, themselves, and my son.but I feel , having my son arrestedwent beyond the situation.thanks so much again, I hear your concern, I havefelt this concern for so long, it's killing ME",

Get a wrist watch that has alarms on it.\u00a0\u00a0Mine has 3 alarms. 1 goes off at 10 am to tell me to eat a snack, the next alarm goes off at 3 pm to tell me to eat a snack and the 3rd alarm goes off at 6 pm to tell me to eat dinner.\u00a0\u00a0I don't need an alarm to tell me to eat breakfast or lunch, but if I could find a 6 alarm watch I would have the breakfast and lunch programed in.I had to get the alarm watch as I would \"forget\" to eat my snacks and then I would get LOW blood sugar stupid.It worked for me.\u00a0\u00a0My wife thanks the world of that $40 Timex.Bob",

I am trying to get otheragencies involved for home visits, and nutritionso such. I am trying to get him in his own placewhere he can feel better about himself.

I have many doctors trying to find out the reasons of the seizures but still no final explanations. This is very scary to me. Thank you, 510",

    "question": "I am gathering some information on others with diabetes thatalso have seizures, my 23 year old son has had diabetes for 10years. About 5 years ago he started to experience seizures.He is on many meds, diabetes, seizures, mental health..many issues here. the main question I have is that when my sonexperienced a seizure recently, 911 call for help resulted in the police also arriving. I was not present. My son coming out of a seizure state, not know what was going on and scared with Police at his home, he 'kissed' a police officer, (male officer) he was charged with 2nd degree assault & then they went to arrest him and of course he resisted and put up a fight, therefore 2nd charge of 2nd degree asault and now resisting arrest.Anyone else have any problems?Court is behind us, he had ton's of witnesses with documentation from drs about his behavior and was just release from the hospital with 3rd degree burns from having a seizure in the shower. Yet the attorneys put this on the 'stet docket'.so if my son stays out of trouble, for a year, he's ok.my son has daily seizure, we are terrified to call 911.Any assistance is greatly appreciated.",
