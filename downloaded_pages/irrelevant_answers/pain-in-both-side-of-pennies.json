            "answer": "Hi,How old are you?Your primary concern here is the \"erectile problem\", is this correct?Are there any underlying disease like a high blood pressure or diabetes?Try to observe your symptoms. If you still get night time erections then this is a good sign. I feel there is no cause of further worries here. Arousal may cause genital congestion and this may cause pain.Prostatic congestion may also present with pain and prostatic drainage through ejaculation at most 2x a week may relieve the fullness and pain that may accompany this .Do keep us posted with regards to your progress.",
