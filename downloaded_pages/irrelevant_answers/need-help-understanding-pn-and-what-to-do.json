            "answer": "A PN is a very general term for a problem with the nerves to your arms and legs. From your description, it sounds like there is a painful \"neuropathy\" or problem with the nerves in your legs in a stocking like distribution. This is a common pattern of neuropathy that we see all the time. Diabetes, b12 deficiency and alcohol are well known causes. There are many other causes that are not as common as those three and some cases have no known cause. If your doc just checked your blood for diabetes rather than a full glucose tolerance test (where they check your blood sugar after drinking a sweet substance), diabetes may have been missed. Talk to your doctor about this especially if you have a family history. B complex has other Bvitamins than just B12, but if you have a real B12 deficiency, a B complex is not going to cut it. We recommmend shots of B12 for those who really have the disease. For further evaluation, get a neuro referral, more blood tests especially for B12 and its markers (MMA and homocysteine) and possibly an EMG. And for treatment in the meantime, elavil and neurontin can be helpful.Good luck.",

    "question": "How do I know I have PN even though that is what my doctor said?My feet feal like leather and have shooting pains in them, plus they feel like they are on fire and are numb.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the feeling goes all the way up my legs to my knees. It is always there however, sometimes it is unberable and I cannot stand anything on my feet. My Doctor discribed B-complex.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure that helps. I read that b-12 helps some people. what is the difference between b-complex and b12? My Doctor has not required any testing except blood test for Diabitis. That was borderline.So what should I do now?\u00a0\u00a0I cannot stand the pain much longer.I have an HMO and I am not sure if this is why there haven't been more test required. Is there any cure for this? I am over weight by about 60 lbs if I loose weight would that help? I do have alot of back pain both in my lower back and upper back between my shoulders. Could this be the cause also? I know these are alot of questions but I need help understanding what this is and what can I do to help it go away or get better.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",
