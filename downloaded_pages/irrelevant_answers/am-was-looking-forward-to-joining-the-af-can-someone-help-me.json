            "answer": "I have a friend who was in the army and I called her for some advice.\u00a0\u00a0She told me a couple things, first there is an AF base in Colorado(which you probably knew) but did you call and ask questions?\u00a0\u00a0Did you look on their website?\u00a0\u00a0Or did you go and visit--that might be a good idea--then you could talk to people and get some answers.Secondly she told me that there are many people who get denied entry to the army bacause anyone who needs to take medication that they cannot live without cannot join the armed forces, for example anyone with a seizure disorder would be denied or a thyroid condition.Thirdly, she told me that Civil Servants do make a lot of money--somthing to think about before tossing out that idea.I have been diabetic for 26 years and wanted you to know I can understand your frustration, probably not exactly but I have a good idea of how you feel.\u00a0\u00a0I won't go on and on about it but I do think you will channel all that drive and determination into a great career.\u00a0\u00a0I do know diabetes has made me tough, I can do anything I put my mind to.",

            "answer": "Hmmmm, George may not be watching the Forum now, so I will offer an answer to the question I asked of him earlier since folks may be wondering. CAP stands for Civil Air Patrol, and it appears from his comment that his friend seems to think that this organization may allow him to work for them. He was not clear about whether he wanted to be a pilot or whether he wants to do crew work, but this may be a way for him to do something with planes as a civilian. Perhaps he will re-surface and elaborate. Civil Air Patrol as a background will not, however, change the health restrictions of the Air Force. I am the wife of an Air Force professional, and know that health issues like this that require medication for survival will indeed prevent them from allowing him to join. It is partly because of the risk to that person if sent to a location or put in a situation where the medication is NOT available, and partly due to strictly financial issues -- active duty military are guaranteed health care for life, and no military organization can afford to bring in people that they know already have conditions that will require costly medications and treatment for the rest of their lives. There just is not room in the tight budget for that.",

    "question": "I was Reading some other posts and learned i now can't Join the AF, Because i have type1 diabetes. I know most of you will say there are other jobs out there, I looiked into Civilian Employment(i dissagreed with it,50%). But i'm a student at Denver School of the Arts[High School(Denver,CO)] and my MAJOR is BAND. my current lifelong dream is to join the AF, and nowi'm very dissapointed that i can't join due to my conditions. I want to join because The sense of pride; working side by side with other Airmen.Because Airmen work as a GROUP, NOT as An INDIVIDUAL.Besides that i want to ask if there is currently an enlisted/officer, retiree, or civilian AF employee that can help me by showing me some Career/Options fields that may accept a type 1 Diabetic.Also what dissapoints me gravely is that i will not be able to join, but my friend can.Wich has flushed all my dreams and aspirations down the toilet to becoming a leader in the govermental institution of the AF.I hope there's someone out there that can help. Preferabally in the AF(or Associated). And Preferabally someone in the Rocky Mountain Region.",
