            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since there is a co-relation between your periods and sweating, chances of polycystic ovary or PCOD are there. Endocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism (ruled out), acromegaly and glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia both) all result in increased sweating. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating. It can also be due to low blood pressure. Get your adrenal gland function tested. . Avoid too much of tea, coffee, smoking and spicy food.\u00a0\u00a0Please discuss this with your doctor and get yourself investigated accordingly.Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "Maybe you should get your female hormone levels checked (specific days of your cycle the gyn doctor can tell you when), like FSH.\u00a0\u00a0Also, estrogen and progesterone levels.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wondering if you are getting a number of estrogen dips causing hot flashes?\u00a0\u00a0If any endocrine numbers related to your pituitary aren't normal, ask for a dynamic MRI with and without contrast of your pituitary gland.\u00a0\u00a0Also, does your heart rate go fast usually but slow down toward your mense?\u00a0\u00a0Tachycardia can cause some sweating too.\u00a0\u00a0I've been sweating with sleeping since at least kindergarten myself.\u00a0\u00a0Then later had hormone issues and orthostatic tachycardia and got hot flashes.\u00a0\u00a0In 2008, found out I had a pituitary tumor, but don't know if my early childhood sleep sweating has anything to do with that!",

    "question": "So I have been excessively been sweating for about 7 years and I am 20!! I have been to the doctor and they checked my thyroid and said that it was fine!! Within the last 6 month I noticed it stops sometimes a week before I start my period!! The no sweating, which is pretty much heaven on earth as goofy as that sounds, last about 10 days at the most!! End of period, which is usually 5 days, I sadly start sweating excessively again!! A typical crazy sweating day consist of armpits drenched, cold sweaty hands, and sometimes feet!!! I thought of hyperhidrosis, but it stops now and then like I said!!\u00a0\u00a0So wouldn't that make it a hormonal problem but not thyroid??!!!\u00a0\u00a0Please help it drives me crazy!!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much for your time!!\u00a0\u00a0Peace Out!!!",
