            "answer": "So exciting.. glad things are moving along.. thats probably why my doctor was so shocked by my 2 Cm dilation over night.. but of course im still pregnant.. thursday cant come fast enough (39 week appointment)..if there is one thing i learned that the more your dilated, the more you feel the checks.. my 1 Cm checks were barely uncomfortable, 3 cm hurt like hell..Now your at term and hopefully things will keep moving for you!",

    "question": "I had my 37 week appointment today and growth scan ultrasound. Baby looks great! He is measuring 7lbs 4oz and in the 64th percentile. My last ultrasound at 34 weeks I had excessive amniotic fluid and today the fluid levels are completely normal now. Not really sure where all the fluid went? LOL.Since I have gestational diabetes they were monitoring the baby's abdomen size. At 34 weeks he was measuring 37 weeks and today he was only measuring 38 weeks so it's great that his growth seems to have evened out.I am 1 1/2 cm dilated and I was only 1/2 cm 2 weeks ago. I've had major cramping over the last several days so it seems to have been dilating me. She said this is great progress for a first time mom. I've been bleeding since she checked me earlier (OMG it killed to get checked!! OUCH!!) and she said this is actually a good thing- it's stirring things up down there. She didn't seem entirely convinced that I'll make it to my due date and said **IF** I'm still pregnant in 2 weeks (39 weeks) then she will set and induction date for me!! So excited to me my little boy very soon!!",
