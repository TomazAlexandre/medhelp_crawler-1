            "answer": "No it won't hurt and you don't have to do it ...but..just walking short spurts throughout the day will help with the shortness of breath and it also will help keep you healthy and help fight gestational diabetes by having your body burning and breaking down sugars. By no means do you need to do a full on work out but you should walk maybe 3-5 mins here and there throughout the day..I have the same problem with shortness of breath and walking to domy grocery shopping leaves me feeling like i ran a triathlon and exhausted. I walk on and off throughout the day and I'm telling you it will help with your shortness if breath :)",
