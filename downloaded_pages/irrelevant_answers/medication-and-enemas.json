I will drown in water today and keep my fingers crossed thanks again.",

            "answer": "Increasing fiber is equally as important as the fluid. There are tasty things on the market that might help. My personal favorites are Plum Smart (a tangy juice that's way better than syrupy old prune juice), Shredded Wheat cereal (rather bland but effective) and my all time favorite now is Fiber One with Honey Clusters cereal. That one does have some sodium in it but a small bowl a day and things run smoothly. The cereal is lightly sweetened and seems to have a mild maple flavor to me.Of course there are the healthy foods too like fruits and veggies. Get your fiber and fluid at the same time.",
