I've also been told they're anxiety related, but like you, it happens when I'm going to sleep and times when I'm not anxious. I was wondering if you ever heard anything conclusive from your doctor as to what this could be.Thank you!",

    "question": "I've been a type 1 diabetic for 22 years (24 years old now, diagnosed at 22 months and have always maintained good blood sugar control (A1C from 7 - 8). Recently I have experienced frequent heartburn, and near constant burping. I know these are symptoms of gastroparesis, which is a common complication. I am just wondering if anyone has any experience with this and if they have had success in treating it?Next, I also am having issues with ym breathing. It feel like I can never get a full satisfying breath. I have to gasp for air (in a sort of slow and controlled manner) every few breaths or I feel light headed. I am scheduled for an echocardiogram this week to investigate.My GP dismisses most of my symptoms as beign anxiety related.\u00a0\u00a0While I do often experience anxiety I experience the symptoms when I am totally calm, leading me to believe they are not anxiety related.\u00a0\u00a0Furthermore, the symptoms have worsened over time.",
