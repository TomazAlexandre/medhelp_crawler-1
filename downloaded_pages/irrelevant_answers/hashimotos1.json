            "answer": "If you are starting out on med, some wierd things can be felt. As long as nothing is a major symptom, youll probably be OK. Hormones are changing, you will feel it.The symptoms you describe are normally from being hypo, not from the med. Maybe 'ease' into the med slower? - Ask you doc.",

            "answer": "You symptoms sound like you need more thyroid hormone. It might take several months until those symptoms are gone. What meds are you taking?If I could recommend one book to my Hashi friends, it would be this one: http://www.thyroidbook.com/You mention dizziness when you eat, and I have to wonder what you're eating. Things that can worsen the Hashi antibodies: caffeine, gluten, refined sugar or just too much sugar, dairy, soy, corn, green tea. Cough syrup is bad stuff for thyroids, too.You have to do an elimination diet to see what works for you.Also, the back of the neck pain could be a hypo issue or a vitamin D. issue. Remember that many Hashis have VERY low D levels. You might want to consider adding 1,000 IU D daily to your diet and then slowly up to 4,000 IU. Hashis tend to be low in iron and B12 as well.I take Selenuium (200 strength) once a day to contain the neck swelling, as well as Motrin as needed. I take Magnesium three times a day for joint pain and constipation.All meds/vitamins should be four hours or longer after taking the thyroid meds. Thryoid meds should be on an empty stomach in the morning and no food/drink except water for an hour.Yes, many Hashis have low adrenals. Get the 24 hour saliva test.Also, some Hashis have other auto-immunities such as Sjrogen's or diabetes. Be aware of that as well.:) Tamra",
