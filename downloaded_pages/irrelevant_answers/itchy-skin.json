            "answer": "Hello,Itchy skin that isn't accompanied by other obvious skin changes, such as a rash, is most often caused by dry skin (xerosis) which can be due to hot or cold weather with low humidity levels, long-term use of air conditioning or central heating, and washing or bathing too much.Other conditions which cause itchy skin are psoriasis,dermatitis, scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem, treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

    "question": "I went to a renaissance fair 2 weeks ago and was bitten by something.\u00a0\u00a0I developed 2 bumps on my arm that were very itchy.\u00a0\u00a0I thought it was maybe a sand fly because I recently killed 2 bugs in my home that looked like a sand fly.\u00a0\u00a0I have developed more sports since then, mainly on my arms.\u00a0\u00a0They are not really healing.\u00a0\u00a0They do not itch but they look very unattractive.\u00a0\u00a0Also since then I have had itchy skin all over (not on the bumps on my arms.\u00a0\u00a0Mostly around the face.)\u00a0\u00a0I was thinking maybe I have dry skin?\u00a0\u00a0I have been using lotion a lot more lately, and have washed all my clothes and bed sheets.\u00a0\u00a0My mom checked my head for lice (maybe I picked something up at the renaissance fair?) and says that I don't have any (She is a nurse so I trust her, so I think I have dandruff).\u00a0\u00a0Anybody have any idea what this could be?\u00a0\u00a0I'm kinda stressing out over it.",
