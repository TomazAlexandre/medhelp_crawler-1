            "answer": "From my understanding portal hypertension is increased blood pressure through the portal vein typically caused by liver disease when blood flow through the liver is impaired.\u00a0\u00a0What you are describing sounds more like a reflux or perhaps a gall bladder issue.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have any other symptoms of liver disease?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had liver function bloodwork done?",

            "answer": "I would expect that if you do have portal hypertension then you would also have abnormal liver markers. Your ALT would likely be elevated unless your liver is so cirrhotic that there are not enough live cells remaining to release enzymes. Your bilirubin would probably be elevated as would your AST, GGT and alkaline phosphatase. You might see a decreased albumin and your clotting time (PTT) would likely be longer and you would probably have a low platelet count. And you should have other symptoms of cirrhosis such as ascites, spider veins, edema, encephalopathy (mental confusion) red palms etc.Fetor hepaticus is a symptom of late stage liver disease and it doesn't exist in a vacuum. If you haven't already had a full liver blood work I think that would be a starting point.Good luck,Mike",
