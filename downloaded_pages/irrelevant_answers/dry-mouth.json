            "answer": "Hi,I don't know if it is related to perimenopause, but I have been experiencing the same thing off and on. This past week I have especially noticed it. I drink a lot of water throughout the day, yet my mouth and throat feel so dry. Last night it was really bad, I kept waking up to take a drink of water, and this morning I woke up with my period.I have not yet seen a Dr. for this specific problem, but have seen the Dr. for the many other \"perimenopausal\" symptoms I have been experiencing. Of course the Docs. can find no cause for any of my symptoms and even the 40 something female docs act as if they have never heard of menopause.Each and every month seems to bring on something new, it can be quite frustrating.",
