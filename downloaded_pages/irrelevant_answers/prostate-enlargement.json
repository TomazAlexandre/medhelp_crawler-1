            "answer": "Hi,For this first part, the post actually refers to reduction in prostate cancer, not really benign growth (because I felt this was the more important issue though you didn't mention it):There is a role for diet and exercise, but the effect is a bit unclear.For diet \u2013 the exact role of fat, fruits and vegetables, fibre have not clearly shown uniform reductions in risk for developing prostate cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Part of the reason may de the inherent difficulty in making sure a strict diet is maintained, the effect of modern methods of fortifying some food with vitamins and supplements, and that dietary patterns may be better studied from childhood. At any rate, what would be considered a balanced diet to prevent heart disease and diabetes is a good thing to keep in mind.For exercise, the role may be related to hormonal changes. Hormones dictate prostate size and are part of the development of cancer. Moderate activity is protective (hence you wouldn't need to go for marathons). The role of sleep may also be important, as people with irregular sleep patterns (like workers who change working shifts) may be predisposed to abnormal hormonal changes (the evidence for this is still preliminary).Be careful, as there may be herbal supplements which would claim to control the size of\u00a0\u00a0the prostate. Some of them have been evaluated and the efficacy was due to the presence of hormones. Taking hormones may shrink the prostate, but it may also promote cancer (the evidence for this is also preliminary, but since there is an avoidable harm \u2013 it may be a good idea to find out what such concoctions actually contain).For preventing benign enlargment only:The effect of diet and exercise may be useful due to a decreased incidence of diabetes \u2013 which is a common co-morbidity with prostatic enlargement. Increased activity and alcohol in moderation may be protective. The exact role of cholesterol, hypertension, and smoking is not yet clear (best avoid the cigarettes though \u2013 as there is an association with prostate cancer mortality).",
