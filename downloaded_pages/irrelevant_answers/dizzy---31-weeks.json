            "answer": "LauraB78,Ah, the page turning headliners. Anyway, It could be that you have a secondary infection such as an ear infection. That would cause dizziness too. But also, dizziness is normal in the later months because of our increased blood volume. It is very common when standing up quickly, getting out of a warm bath, etc. It can be worse because you have the flu too. One of the flu symptoms is dizziness. But let us know what the doc says. Oh, and keep hydrated as much as possible.",

    "question": "So, this is likely because I am sick right now anyway, but I was wondering if anyone else has experienced dizzyness around 31 weeks? I have been having it on and off for a couple days, but am just figuring I should chalk it up to a side effect of the flu.. Anyone think I should be more concerned? I luckily have a Dr. appt. today @ 4pm anyway so I will ask them as well but always appreciate the insight I get here on medhelp!",
