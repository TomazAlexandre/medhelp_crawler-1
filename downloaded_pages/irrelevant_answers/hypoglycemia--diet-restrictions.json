    "question": "I've had hypoglycemia most of my life and crohn's disease for all of it (though only diagnosed a few years ago), so I've always had to be kind of careful. I was wondering if anyone else had experience with restrictive diets and hypoglycemia during pregnancy? At 27 weeks I'm struggling to keep my blood sugar up/stable between what foods are and aren't recommended during pregnancy combined with what my flare-prevention diet allows. Never mind my terror over the spike in my blood sugar that my impending gtt is holding over my head- I really don't want to get misdiagnosed with gestational diabetes just to completely crash on the way home. Anyone with a similar issue have any advice? I know I can't really do much peanut butter or oatmeal and fruit only seems to be a very temporary fix. :/",
