            "answer": "Hello!\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you are choosing to join with JDRF.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a parent of a kid with diabetes, just like you.\u00a0\u00a0JDRF is a wonderful organization, and the only one solely focused on type 1 diabetes research.\u00a0\u00a0Children with Diabetes is also a wonderful organization, and the Quilt for Life display is very powerful.\u00a0\u00a0We have submitted our quilt square (a 3 foot by 3 foot square), the link to it is here:http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/activities/quilt/pages/1/q451i.htmThe honeymoon is the period of time shortly after the diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes during which there is some restoration of insulin production and the blood sugar levels improve to normal, or near-normal, levels. The theory goes that when external insulin is first given, the pancreas becomes less stressed, and can actually begin producing insulin on it's own.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, like other honeymoons, this diabetes honeymoon doesn't last forever; it may last for weeks, months, or occasionally, years.\u00a0\u00a0Some people never have a honeymoon, some honeymoons last a long time.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter has been honeymooning for over 2 years now, and I've talked to people whose kids are honeymooning for over 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0The majority do not last that long, though, typically it's a few months at most.A1C is also called the HbA1c.\u00a0\u00a0It is a 3 month average for the red blood cells in your system.\u00a0\u00a0Hemoglobin is the part of red blood cells that carries oxygen to the cells and sometimes joins with glucose. Because the glucose stays attached for the life of the cell (about 4 months), a test to measure hemoglobin A1c shows what the person's average blood glucose level was for that period of time.\u00a0\u00a0The value of your A1c is the amount of glucose that is attached to that hemoglobin.\u00a0\u00a0The higher your average blood sugars, the higher your A1c value.\u00a0\u00a0The better control you have, the lower your A1c will be.Please let us know if you have any more questions!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "You can tell when the honeymoon stage is coming to an end when your blood sugar starts to rise and you have to increase your insulin doses to get the same results. During the honeymoon your body is still producing some of its own insulin, when it ends you are producing less or none so you need more injected insulin to control blood sugar.",
