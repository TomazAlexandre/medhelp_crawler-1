It's a very important test, your baby is more likely to be stillborn with untreated diabetes, among many, many other things. I agree with the other ladies, if you fail the first one, just ask to be treated like a diabetic then that way you don't have to go through the 3 hour. But a LOT of women fail the 1st and not the 2nd.",
