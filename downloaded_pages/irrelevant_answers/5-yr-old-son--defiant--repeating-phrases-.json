            "answer": "I'd say that it's normal for his age - children always want to test the waters, learn where the boundaries are....and then, even when they know where they are, they'll often cross them - just to see what happens when they do!\u00a0\u00a0I think you're doing the right thing by acknowledging the behaviour and then asking him to stop.\u00a0\u00a0I think that you need to let him know that he should be listening to you rather than openly defying you - without making it a HUGE deal, because that can sometimes make it more \"fun\"/like a \"game\".I'm sorry to hear about your son's diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Even if he appears to be handling it well, it's still a lot for a little boy to deal with and so I wouldn't rule out that this may be behind his sudden defiance....although I'm more inclined to lean towards his age as the culprit - I do think this is normal behaviour for a boy his age.",

            "answer": "Only other bit of information which may or may not be relevant is that he did have a transient tic about 9 months ago where he was flicking his fingers...it was usually when he was watching a movie or we were reading a book...kind of a nervous thing.\u00a0\u00a0I guess that is what makes me question it???\u00a0\u00a0But right now, I am trying to be calm and not make a big deal out of it whle also calmly disciplining him when he does not obey.\u00a0\u00a0So confusing???",

    "question": "My 5 yr old son was diagnosed with diabetes in late November.\u00a0\u00a0He has handled it really well, no problem with testing his blood, takes one shot a day, very open about it with others...just as of 3 weeks ago, he began saying things (full sentences) and would repeat the sentence.\u00a0\u00a0Usually like, \"oops sorry I burped\".\u00a0\u00a0But he would repeat it a few seconds later whether he burped or not.\u00a0\u00a0We acknowledge it and then tell him to please stop saying it.\u00a0\u00a0He immediately says the phrase again after we tell him not to...he touched something I told him not to; he then walked over and looked at me and touched it again.\u00a0\u00a0That to me is defiant...and the phrases, I ask him, \"Why are you saying that?\" and his answer is \"I don't know.\"\u00a0\u00a0He will look right at us and say the phrase again after being asked to stop.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if this is something beyond defiance or if this is normal at this age???",
