    "question": "I am a 20 yr diabetic female w/ a history of asthma and hayfever.\u00a0\u00a0For the past 5-8 days I have been experiencing sharp pains on the left side of my lower back.\u00a0\u00a0I am not confident about my back anatomy knowledge, but I am concerned this might be near my kidney.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is at times very bad and makes it difficult to even walk.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it is better and I can ignore it.\u00a0\u00a0Often if I lie down in a certain position I can make it feel better.My hemoglobin a1C is 9.5% and recently in particular my blood sugars have run high.\u00a0\u00a0The pain is very uncomfortable and would be distressing on its own, but most of all I am concerned that it is related to diabetes and/or my kidneys.Any advice will be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Katie",
