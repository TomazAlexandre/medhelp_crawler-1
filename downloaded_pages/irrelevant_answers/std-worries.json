    "question": "I gave a guy a blowjob on 9/3 and within 48 hours of the event have been feeling continuously unwell.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms:Oral Sex Monday night 9/3Tuesday felt OKWednesday afternoon worsening nausea and slight abdominal painThursday - day off work, tired, sore joints, nausea still bad, constipation and problem urinating, slight headache, slight sore throat.\u00a0\u00a0Glands feel a tiny bit hard to the touch, and perhaps a tiny bit enlarged (neck).\u00a0\u00a0Abdominal pain worsening, but it's not really delicate to the touch when placing some force with my hands in the abdominal area.Friday - back to work, still tired, nausea still present but not as strong, constipation and urinating problems persist (weaker urine stream than usual).\u00a0\u00a0Sore joints not as bad.\u00a0\u00a0Still lethargic.Saturday - much like Friday, but nausea a bit worse, but not as bad as Wednesday/Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0Sore joints goneSunday - Felt OK.\u00a0\u00a0Bowel and urine movements a bit better, but I was drinking more water.\u00a0\u00a0It's possible that my constipation problems etc were due to not drinking enough water (I suffer from both IBS and Type 2 diabetes).Monday - return to nauseaville and a stronger headache in the temple areas.\u00a0\u00a0Urinating is better as I'm drinking my normal 2L of water per day.Tuesday - wake up to what feels like a head cold, which worsen throughout the day.Wednesday (today) - another day off work, throat feels sore today, the most sore it's been since the oral sex episode.\u00a0\u00a0Masturbated and felt that there was a very slight Reddish tinge to my precum.no rash present, no white sores in throat/mouth/no blistering visible.\u00a0\u00a0No fever present.\u00a0\u00a0I have an unusually low body temperate (usually around 36.1), but since feeling unwell, it's been in the 35s and even as low as 34.9 (last night).\u00a0\u00a0I haven't noticed any discharge from my penis.It almost feels like a stomach bug, cold and bladder infection all wrapped in one, with a headache on top of it all.\u00a0\u00a0The headache hasn't really been bad except for Monday 16/3.\u00a0\u00a0It's more like a slight nuisance headache than anything (I suffer from migraines, so normal headaches don't really phase me these days).I haven't had any blood tests yet as I think it's too early.\u00a0\u00a0I presume that suffering from Diabetes type 2, and having a weakened immune system due to being highly stressed might mean that any STD would affect me earlier than the average healthy human.\u00a0\u00a0I was going to leave it to the 6 week mark to get tested for all STDs, since many probably won't show up so early on (it's only been just over a week).\u00a0\u00a0I'm suspecting hep a/bc/hiv.\u00a0\u00a0The guy says he's clean and was recently tested and isn't really active in the male/male scene, he doesn't do anal (which I don't either) and has only engaged in guys giving him oral.\u00a0\u00a0I understand that STD transmission during oral sex is generally lower than vaginal or anal sex, but I do also have dental issues (gingervitis and gum bleeding) that might make it easier for viruses to get into my system that way.Any advice appreciated.",
