            "answer": "Congratulations on becoming a grandmother!!\u00a0\u00a0As for pregnancy after tubal ligation, yes it is possible, just not very common.\u00a0\u00a0It is however, important to find out for certain as if you are in fact pregnant, you are at a much higher risk for a tubal pregnancy and that needs to ruled out.\u00a0\u00a0The best thing to do would be to either take a home pregnancy test, or have your Dr. run a blood test to find out for certain. Good luck, I hope you get the answer you are looking for.",

    "question": "I am 36 years old and a new grandma...(thank you thank you). I had a tubal ligation done 8 years ago. After my second child. I was just recently diagnosed with type 2 diabetes. I went to my Doctor and had a Ladies exam done and everything came back normal. Which to me is odd, I have never had a period on time. Well I started having hot flashes and mood swings. My poor husband feels like he is walking on glass. So I went back to doc and decided to see if I was going into early medapause (i know its spelled wrong)....Well the answer was negative...I am in great condition. Well my mood swings have progressed and so have the hot flashes. Now I feel as if I can have sex 24/7. (Poor husband I know).Well now everyone is telling me I am pregnant. I am not into getting pregnant. I got fixed for a reason. But everyone that sees me states I am glowing. I figured it was the hot flashes....Please someone tell me it is impossible to get pregnant after a tubal ligation.......Please help a young granny out",
