            "answer": "Instead of focusing on eating more, I mostly have been focusing on getting enough protein and calcium and have been making sure I get a good variety of healthy foods. I am 22 weeks today and have gained 25 lbs so far. Being pregnant with twins you will have a lot more doctor appointments and they will monitor your weight and your babies' growth so you will always know whether you are on the right track.",

Did you have to do that?With my first pregancy I also had gestational diabetes and was on a strict diet; I am afraid that with heavier diet diabetes will be exacerbated.",
