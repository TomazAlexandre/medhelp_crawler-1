            "answer": "Hi!Just dieting is not a solution for controlling weight. If there is no underlying medical cause, then you need a proper diet and exercise program to lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0When one is overweight and knows this and wants to reduce then the pattern of eating you face is common. It is not uncommon to be depressed, not eat for periods of time and then go for binge eating.What you need to do is eliminate the common causes of increase in weight such as overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, and hypothyroidism. Anemia, low proteins, adrenal gland problems, kidney and liver problems and Cushing Syndrome has to be eliminated. Late night snacking and poor sleep patterns too cause weight gain. Certain medications like antidepressants cause weight gain. Polycystic ovary too causes weight gain, hence has to be ruled out by an ultrasound of abdomen.If the above causes are eliminated then you can join a weight trainer and a nutrition expert and follow their advice and lose weight under their guidance.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi everyone. I've been having weight problems since I was 11 when I discovered hormon problems. I am 22 now. I went to see my gynecologist a few days ago. He said the hormons are good now, not perfect, BUT better.My maximum weight was 100kg. I did this big diet 3 years ago and lost 22kg, so went down to 78kg. Since then, I've been having ups and downs but now I'm 93kg again and I can't lose weight and stablize. I always lose some and then gain it back. It's tiring. I've been on a diet since I was 12. I have those moments were you can't think anything else BUT food and I really need to lose weight. It's a matter of helth now. My belly button is messed up now. I need to lose weight. ANY HELP? PLEASE???Thanks,Eleni",
