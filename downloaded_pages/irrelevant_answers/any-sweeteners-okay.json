            "answer": "I was advised to use splenda as well especially after they diagnosed me with gestational diabetes. The specialist I went to said \"it is sugar for you and not for your baby\" so i guess maybe it doesn't cross over as much. Other than that i don't have much for you in the ttc part of it although i know how you feel about wanting to check everything out and see if it might have been related to your m/c.",

    "question": "I'm drinking Decaf Coffee and Decaf Tea these days and I'm a huge Splenda Fan..normally I use a couple packets everyday, but I've heard it's not good while Pregnant (or when TTC). I've been using Sugar but I feel like I have to use so much of it to even taste it at all and it's so unhealthy...I'd really prefer to use a Substitute. Anyone use anything? Or know of any Sugar Substitute that is safe to ingest?",
