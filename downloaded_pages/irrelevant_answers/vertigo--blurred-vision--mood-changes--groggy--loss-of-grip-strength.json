            "answer": "Sounds like you are thinking of a number of possibilities and I think you should get tested to see if you are on the right track.\u00a0\u00a0You'd likely need a referral from a primary care doctor to a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0An MRI of the brain is hopefully what a neurologist would order for one thing.\u00a0\u00a0They could check for brain tumors, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Regarding your sitting and change in grip strength, they could test about that too.\u00a0\u00a0They may want to conduct an EMG on your affected arm & hand.And they might want to ask some cognitive questions to help in trying to rule out Alzheimer's which you mention.\u00a0\u00a0You may even want to get your vitamin B 12 level measured.\u00a0\u00a0B 12 is thought to help with memory and if that is low, the deficiency would definitely need a correction.Also, you might look into getting an ear, nose, & throat specialist to order VNG and other vestibular testing regarding your dizziness that increases with head turning.With mood, you may want to make sure your thyroid function is normal, as if this is off, it can definitely adversely affect your mood.\u00a0\u00a0Also you may want to get cortisol tested, because depression and abnormal levels of that hormone can go together.I hope you will go to an opthamologist too about your visual changes, so he/she can evaluate that situation more thoroughly than a neurologist would typically do.Do not give up- it is good you are seeking help!\u00a0\u00a0If you are feeling suicidal right now, please call 9-1-1 or your emergency telephone number.\u00a0\u00a0And if you would like to know the Comforter of the depressed, private message me and I'd be glad to share about Him.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the help so far.To answer the questions and to clarify some of my statements:Yes, I have thought of several causes for my symptoms including:Parasitic/nematode infection (roundworms, tapeworms, and others):I have done research on this and as larvae spread they can infect various organs including the eyes, brain, heart, lungs etc.\u00a0\u00a0and can cause muscular weakness, abdominal discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0As they migrate to other organs like the brain symptoms can include irritability and other brain/memory disturbances, decreased visual acuity as they infect the eyes.\u00a0\u00a0I have eaten sushi and sashimi (raw fish) before. I eat lots of raw vegetables so my thinking on that could be transmission from wild animal feces from farms onto the raw vegetables. I wash raw vegetables but I've never sterilize them (I'm not sure if there is away to do that anyway to raw vegetables).\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure how likely that is though to catch a parasitic infection from raw vegetables. It sounds very likely but I'm not sure how probable it is.Diabetes:Although, I've never eaten a bad diet which is typical of causing diabetes so I doubt that is it.Brain tumor.Symptoms seem very close to that.\u00a0\u00a0The only symptom I don't have for brain tumor is nausea.Early stage Alzheimer's:I'm not sure when signs or symptoms start to occur. I'm still very young. It doesn't explain my decreased visual acuity though. My parents never had it. I have 1 uncle on my mom's side and he never had it. 2 uncles and 1 aunt on my dads side and they never had it.Inner ear infection/inflammation:Although vertigo matches, some of my symptoms don't match like my decreased visual acuity and mood changes. So it's very unlikely it is that.As far as my B-12 is concerened I take allot of supplements so I'm not lacking in nutrients.I have my eyes checked every year and the doctor says my eyes are normal for my age. I have a slight stigmatism in one eye but he doesn't feel I need to wear glasses yet.I would like to have an MRI of my brain to for my comfort and peace of mind and to rule out any brain tumors.As far as the depression and despondency. It could be situational. My brother passed away at 40 years old in 2001, my father passed away last year.\u00a0\u00a0I had to deal with all the loss and help my mom through it all.\u00a0\u00a0I lost my corporate job in 2005 and have been under employed (barley making it) ever since then.\u00a0\u00a0Although I've just changed careers so things are looking up in the employment area anyway.I feel a bit helpless because I have this basket full of symptoms that I can't explain and I'm just afraid my doctor may not take the time to investigate or diagnose my symptoms.",

    "question": "I'm a 43 year old male 6\"3\" tall, 180 lb. I never smoked, non drinker. I have consumed a very healthy diet all my life, avoiding all junk food excess salt and sugar and have always exercise regularly.My family history:\u00a0\u00a0My mother had cancer of the throat when she was young but is now 73 and very healthy.\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother on my fathers side had mouth cancer and died from it.\u00a0\u00a0No brain tumors in my family history that I know of. The one case of Alzheimer's in my family history from my mothers aunt.Here are my symptoms:Dizziness:My most recent occurrence was when I was at a company luncheon with a dozen other coworkers sitting around the table at the restaurant. I began to feel dizzy and a bit \"spaced\" similar to being drunk or intoxicated with a sensation as if I was trying to balance my head on my shoulders. As I turned my head from side to side the dizziness and spaced feeling increased. This time it really concerned me because it was really extreme and noticeable.\u00a0\u00a0I had breakfast that morning consisting of a spinach omelet, small bowl of oatmeal. orange juice and I had a mid morning snack.\u00a0\u00a0So I ruled out low blood sugar.Chronic but infrequent blurred vision:I have also noticed a rapid change in my vision over the past few years. Upon waking up my distant and close vision is blurry and it appears to get a a little better as the day increases.\u00a0\u00a0What is very odd is that my blurred vision is sporadic and infrequent. For example right now my distant and close vision appears to be clear.\u00a0\u00a0However this time yesterday it was blurry.Loss of grip strength in right hand:Every once in a while I feel a weak sensation in my right hand to the point where I'm unable to make a fist.\u00a0\u00a0Even when I concentrate on trying to close my fingers and make a strong fist, I can't. It's as if my ability to make a fist is paralyzed. it lasts for about 5 min. or so and slowly subsides.\u00a0\u00a0I notice this happens only when I am sitting down. I am also right-handed.\u00a0\u00a0This could be unrelated as if perhaps I'm pressing on a nerve or something with my arm?\u00a0\u00a0Although I don't want to rule it out that It could be related.Sluggish and groggy:I often feel groggy and tired most of the day even after getting 6-8 hours of sleep.Hard to mentally focus and concentrate:I have a hard time retaining information.\u00a0\u00a0My mind tends to drift and wander when I listen to live, class lectures ore read books. The Information is hard for me to retain and I have to read things over and over before my brain understands and retains the information.\u00a0\u00a0Remembering peoples names is becoming harder to do.Intense changes in mood:Over a few years I've slowly noticed that I've become easily irritable, agitated, and little things can make me very angry.\u00a0\u00a0I've been feeling very despondent and depressed lately with infrequent deep depression with thoughts of hopelessness, despair and suicide.I appreciate all your help.",
