            "answer": "Hello~You need to see a neurologist and have some tests run for epilepsy. Epilepsy can present itself in many forms, not just the grand mal seizures.Also, a visit to the chiropractor may not be a bad idea either, if you have pinched nerves in your neck, they can cause all kinds of trouble, even into your legs, that is not to say you don't have pinched nerves in your lower back as well. I certainly would give them a try.",
