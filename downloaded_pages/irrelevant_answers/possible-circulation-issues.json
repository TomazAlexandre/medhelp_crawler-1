    "question": "Hello,About 3 weeks ago I started having waves of sharp pain in my right lower back. About a week ago, I started feeling coldness/tingling/numbness in my right foot at the same time every night 8-9 pm. As of a few days ago, I now experience pain and tingling/numbness in the right leg. These sensations seem to last the entire night and occasionally during the day. There are times when I feel discomfort in all three areas at once -- the back, leg, and foot.Although I have lost a considerable amount of weight this year, I am still very overweight and have Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome. I also have a father and maternal grandmother with diabetes. Could these symptoms be related to diabetes/poor circulation?",
