            "answer": "You should first call your pharmacist and ask if it can be applied to the groin.\u00a0\u00a0Im not sure about the sugar or carbs making you sick, I think this is attributed to something else.\u00a0\u00a0You probably need to first find a new doctor, second have some blood work done, and third discuss your concerns with the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Have them refer you to a urologist due to the sexual dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0The urologist will have a better idea of what is going on because this is what they deal with every day and what they have studied for many of years.\u00a0\u00a0Find a doctor that will listen to you and never accept \"psychological issues or depression\" as a diagnosis when you know there is something wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Hope this helps.",

    "question": "Over a year ago I had a bad groin itch which my dumb doctor gave me a topical cortico-steroid to apply directly to my testicles. I believe it was Triamcinolone Acetonide. Literally days later I developed a severe testicular pain and sexual dysfunction that is still present a year later. Doctors have not been able to find the cause of the pain and attribute it to psychological problems. I have also developed a severe sensitivity to glucose. I cannot eat any sugar or carbs or else I get extremely sick. I have read on many medical sites that this drug should not be applied to the groin. I have also read that cortisol can bind to hormone receptors in the testicles and therefore block out testosterone which is meant to bind there. From this information it seems like applying a cortisol cream to the testicles could cause many sexual problems.Is this possible and what should I do? I am literally at the end of my rope. Doctors are not helping me.",
