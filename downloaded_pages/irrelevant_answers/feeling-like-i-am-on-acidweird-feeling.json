            "answer": "Nothing like answering your own question eh? But I did not want you folks to think I was a goof!But this anxiety really scared the hell out of me. Went to the doctor and he said I am SSRI resistant, probably should not fool around with herbal supplements and not SSRI meds. I feel much better in the last couple of days since the St Johns is out of my system.I also got blood work....turns out my testosterone level is extremely low, which could produce anxiety.Doc suggests testosterone replacement...which I will talk about on another forum.",

    "question": "I was taking .5 mg of Klonopin and did a slow taper. I have been Klonopin free since the end of July and Prozac free for 8 months or so. I am taking nothing.I do have a psychiatrist who I will be seeing this week, but this is an odd set of symptoms? Are they anxiety of something else perhaps? I was so concerned I got a blood test from my PCP to rule out testosterone issues, diabetes or thyroid....No results yet.The symptoms---feel like I am wired---sensation like I drank 10 cups of coffee, chest uncomfortable, voice kind of hoarse, constant urination, bowel movements frequently.agitation, morning fear., insomnia.\u00a0\u00a0But the weirdest sensation is once in a while I feel like I am about to go on an LSD trip--things seem to get brighter and more colorful...very scary! Then I get really scared as if I am truly insane.....Love to hear from you?I started taking St Johns Wort about 12 days ago and things seemed to get more anxious for me once I was on that herb. Stopped 2 days ago and then had that \"acid feeling\" on the second day? Could that be a part of it?",
