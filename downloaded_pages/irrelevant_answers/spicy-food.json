            "answer": "Actually your baby can taste but not in the same way as we do. There's been studies done showing moms who ate a wide variety of foods their babies ate more foods when first starting goods. Versus moms who ate a bland diet, their babies were more stubborn when it came to trying new foods. It's pretty cool. But they can't taste spicy the way we do!",

            "answer": "I have heard the same as mrsreeeder2be - that mother's who eat a larger variety of foods during pregnancy have less picky eaters. The mechanism by which they \"taste\" that I've heard is that the amniotic fluid can take on different flavors according to what we eat. It makes sense to me - all that garlic that comes out of our pores could also go in!",
