            "answer": "The amount of sugar in the drink for the test alters your blood sugar greatly. Its designed so that it spikes your sugar super high in hopes that your body will be able to produce the insulin it needs. When you eat regular foods you aren't getting the same drastic response especially if you have protein along with your carbs... If you were to sit and eat a bag of Swedish fish though you'd respond differently.",

            "answer": "Hmm. Okay. That makes sense. But if I don't eat a lot of sugars or carbs anyway I don't see the big deal on seeing a nutritionist to get my diabetes in check like theybsaod if what I usually eat keeps it at a normal range. I'd never eat a bag of candy in one sitting.",

    "question": "So he has the blood sugar monitor thing. And yesterday I got a call from my doctor saying that I had gestational diabetes. I have an appt Monday to see a nutritionist for my diet. Well since my dad is diabetic I know that 2 hrs after you eat you should test your blood sugar well I ate two hours ago. I had a big torta so there was plenty of bread for carbs and I test my blood sugar it was only 137 my dad said that's completely normal under 140 is great because you should be under 180 after 2 hrs. So how did I fail if my blood sugar isn't abnormal?",
