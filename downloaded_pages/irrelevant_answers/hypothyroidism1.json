            "answer": "Diabetes is when you don't process sugar properly; that's not a symptom of hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0It's entirely possible that you have both.\u00a0\u00a0The sugar issue needs to be taken very seriously.Your major symptoms indicate hypothyroidism, and your family history would certainly warrant getting tested. You need to get tested for TSH, Free T3 and Free T4, along with thyroid antibodies, TPOab and TGab.I see that you are in UK and I don't want to scare you off, but just for your info...... we hear from a lot of our members, that due to NHS guidelines, it's difficult to get tested/treated properly.\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors refuse to test Free T3, which is the most important of the thyroid hormones.\u00a0\u00a0Most of them also rely very heavily on TSH, alone, and many of our members have to either go private or through a lot of red tape in order to get tested/treated adequately.",

    "question": "Hi, I have been advised that my body \"may not be processing sugar properly\" but not sure that its diabetes.I get constant headaches, really bad crams mainly in legs and feet for about 1-2 hours at a time that fluctuates between legs/feet, constipation,feeling cold constantly and weight gain - despite the doctor giving me their version of Alli to which I didnt lose any weight whatsoever and yet supposed to be 3 times more effective. I have checked the symptopms for diabetes and do not really get the \"main\" symtoms but seem to have the symtoms of hypothyroidism but my doctor keeps saying my tests are \"borderline\". All my aunts and mother have hyperthyroidisms and other auto immune deficiencies and my cousins have hashiomotos disease. I am getting really frustrated at not getting any diagnosis. Has anyone else had the same issues? Thanks in advance for any feedback you can give.",
