            "answer": "Hi Sharon, It sounds really awful what you are going through.\u00a0\u00a0I can only assume that maybe the dr is starting her off slowly, did he say how often he would check her?\u00a0\u00a0Certainly she won't stay on 75. I had a total thyroidectomy and am on 175.I don't know where you are in Atlanta, but I am in Gwinnett County and I see Dr. David Shore at North Atlanta Endocrinology and Diabetes (NAED).\u00a0\u00a0It is a mile or so from Gwinnett Medical Center.\u00a0\u00a0He is pretty straight to the point and keeps up with you as long as you need to be monitered.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, if you aren't feeling well, you can call in and get labs right away.\u00a0\u00a0I think she should be seeing an endocrinologist who specializes in this sort of problem and not just a GP.Good luck, I hope you guys get the help you need.jennifer",

            "answer": "Elderly people need less hormone replacement than younger adults. The 75mcg may not be enough, but it is a start, and should be less of a shock to her system than a larger dose.Have her TSH retested every six weeks and see that her meds are adjusted until her TSH is at 1.0 or 2.0 for a couple of tests in a row. Some of her dementia and confusion may improve once her hormones are back where they should be.It might be helpful (depending on the situation) if you could take her to her appointments, as you probably know a bit more about the thyroid than your Father, and can discuss levels with her doctor, in case he thinks a TSH of 4.0 is close enough.",

    "question": "My mother had her entire thyroid removed 30 years ago (or more - unsure of date).\u00a0\u00a0She was originally on 200 mcg of synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0During the last 5 years - a GP she was seeing reduced it down to 75 mcg.\u00a0\u00a0She was then diagnosed with dementia.\u00a0\u00a0Last July her prescription ran out - and she didn't tell my dad - so she hasn't had any synthroid for almost 9 months!They found out because she had gotten to a point where she almost didn't know who she was.\u00a0\u00a0Dad took her to an internist - they did blood work - and her TSH level was 97.49!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0All the doctor did was put her back on the 75 mcg.\u00a0\u00a0She has gotten better memory wise, etc., however I don't think this is enough.I need some help, and don't know where to turn.\u00a0\u00a0It took me 2 years to find someone to diagnose my hypothyroid condition - this is after one GP told me I had sleep apnea (even though I told him I could fall asleep sitting up at my desk) and then another GP who told me that I was Bi-Polar.I am on 75 mcg - and I still have my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0My mother had her's completely removed.Any advice would be appreciated.Thank you.Sharon Miller - Atlanta, GA",
