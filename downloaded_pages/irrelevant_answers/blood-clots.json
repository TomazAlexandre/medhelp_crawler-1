            "answer": "Hi!Well yes, autoimmune disorders like Grave's disease can increase the inflammatory process, and result in formation of blood clots.\u00a0\u00a0In most cases the origin of the blood clot cannot be traced. However, history of heart disease, diabetes, thyroid disorders, increased cholesterol, recent surgery, and deep vein thrombosis increase the possibility of thrombus or clot formation. It is very difficult to diagnose this on net. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",
