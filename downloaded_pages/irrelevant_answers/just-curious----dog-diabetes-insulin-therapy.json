    "question": "Anyone else experience this. My dog gets insulin once a day. He only needs it once a day for the following reason. His sugar should drop to its lowest 6-8hrs after he gets his insulin. My dog's sugar doesn't drop until 12-14 hrs after, so when we tried him on twice a day, the doses began to overlap and he got hypoglycemic. He does this consistently. He was on NPH, but we have just started him on Vetsulin to see if it will regulate his blood sugar better. Today was his first dose and sure enough, he didn't start to drop until 12 hrs after his insulin dose. It isn't exactly a problem. It is actually kind of a good thing, because this way I don't have to stick him twice and I save money. My vet has no explanation other than 'MOST dogs respond this way' and accepts that Loki isn't 'most dogs'. Just curious if anyone else has experienced this.",
