            "answer": "i have had 3 children and my first 2 pregnancies were without gestational diabetes but with my third i got it. I do remember feeling funny after drinking that drink but i do not think it has anything to do with whether or not you have it. Just remember if for some chance you do get it dont freak out. I did! Mine was very easily treated with diet changes and i had to monitor my glucose levels......that did not hurt at all! I hope the test comes back normal.Good luck and let us know! O and the second i had him everything went back to normal which is the case most of the time. :)",

            "answer": "everything went perfectly fine! i had a normal vaginal delivery and he came 10 days early and i was not induced and he weighed 7 pounds 14 oz. he had no problems after being born. If by some chance you do have it like i said try not to panic like i did. Because for the most part it was over nothing.......was not a big deal. i just had to watch my carbs. I ate alot of protein. It was sort of like a adkins diet. It really was not bad and i lost 17 pounds after going on it! So actually it helped me out alot after he was born becasue i had alot less weight to lose! If you have any more questions feel free to ask!",

    "question": "Hi everyone,So really I have 2 questions and would like any input you might have.1. I just did the 1 hour glucose testing for gest. diabetes and I will have my results later today. Anyway, I have had 3 successful pregnancies before in which i did this tersting and never once tested positive for it and the drink has never effected me. After i drank this time i soon became very light headed and just didn't feel right. So my question is has anyone ever felt that way afterwards and ended up with gest. diabetes?I know that everyone is different, so i just want an opinion.2. I have been going trough an extreme energy burst the past couple of days and i have done the whole \"spring\" cleaning thing on my house. Does this sound like nesting to you? Some women say that is what happened before they went into labor and some say its nesting. I am only 27 weeks, so what do you guys think? I do appreciatte your time and comments, and i know this might sound like silly questions but i am being very serious and sincere. Thanks!Tiffany",
