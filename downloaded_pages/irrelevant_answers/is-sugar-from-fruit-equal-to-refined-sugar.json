            "answer": "Fruits contain fructose. Fructose is fruit sugar, a monosaccharide - a very simple sugar. And it is not equal to refined sugar although to diabetics fructose can produce effects similar to sugar. One medium banana [7 - 8\" long], however, contains 51 grams of carbs and 28 grams of carb sugar. Carbs turn into sugar after eating. Some diabetics can tolerate this amount of carbs and carb sugars while others not. The only way for you to know is to test b4 eating [preprandial] and 2-3 hrs after eating [postprandial]. I's best to eat fruits prior to a workout. Your body will burn of glycogen as energy is needed.Also, eat fruits which are low in fructose such as melons and berries. One half of a small melon [5\" in dia] contains approx 8 grams of carbs and 7 grams of carb sugar. Use Google search to see a listing on low fructose fruits.\"The diet site that i'm using suggests 24 g of sugar a day.\"Hopefully not refined sugar nor carb sugars. This amount will definitely jack up your blood sugar levels. Use Google search to learn the difference between \"simple vs complex\" carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Eliminate refined sugar and \"simple\" carbs altogether. The amount of \"complex\" carbs one can handle varies per individual. Some can handle carbs while others very little. Do not deprive your body of complex carbs. Carbs are your fuel for energy. Too little carbs can cause renal impairment.Remember, your meter is your friend. Good luck -",

            "answer": "hello,actually if you\u00a0\u00a0are trying to avoid raising your blood sugar you may need to eliminate sweet fruits and starchy veges, which are both high in carbs.You don't need to eat sweet fruits for health.\u00a0\u00a0Everything that is in fruits are also in vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0If you want to be exacting some fo the foods we call vegetables are also fruits (ie. egg plant, cucumber etc).Do eat plenty of non-starchy veges though to get all your phyto nutrients, vitamins and minerals.Some find berries are ok others find they are not.\u00a0\u00a0Eat based on what your meter tells you and you'll soon find out which 'fruits' and foods are ok for you and which are not.",

            "answer": "Wow, thank you all for the motivation; I now have an understanding of simple vs. complex carbs + glycemic index and load.......\u00a0\u00a0this is going to help a great deal in my bid to control my Diabetes II with food choices. It's exciting stuff. I'll give the best answer to Diabetes86 to help rack up some well deserved points, but really, thank you all so much!!!At first glance, you might want to pass up beets based on their GI alone, despite the fact that they are an excellent source of folate and potassium. But although the GI of cooked beets is 91, a \u00bd-cup serving only has 8.46 grams of carbs. That makes its glycemic load only 7.69 (0.91 \u00d7 8.46). By comparison, a carb-dense large baked potato has 50.96 carbohydrates (with skin), a GI of 121, and a whopping glycemic load of 62a book of GI listings. Dr. Jennie Brand-Miller and Dr. Thomas Wolever, two leading authorities on the GI, have coauthored what is arguably the best of the bunch \u2014 The New Glucose Revolution, 3rd edition. There are also GI databases available online.",

    "question": "I'm trying to reverse my diabetes II with diet and my blood glucose levels are good., but only because i am limiting all sugar. The diet site that i'm using suggests 24 g of sugar a day. One banana a day is 14 grams of sugar therefore if I eat two bananas a day i'm over the suggested allotment. I'm wondering how am i suppose to get 2 or 3 pieces of fruit in my diet with these restrictions. My husband suggested that the sugar in fruit is more easily digested that refined sugar, is this true?",
