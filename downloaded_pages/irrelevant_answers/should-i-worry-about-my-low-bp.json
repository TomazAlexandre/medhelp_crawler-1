            "answer": "Hi,i know how your feeling,i\u00a0\u00a0am metoprolol for heart. I have never had high bp before but doctor said I needed it. My bp runs about 85/45 I was feeling dizzy and sick to my stomach, and a hazzy feeling almost non real or ddreamy feeling, I told the doctor but he said the lower the better as long as I was not feeling faint or fainting,which I think is kinda crazy but aboutt 5 months of taking meds it faded. My bp is still really low but doctor said the way I was feeling was side effects of meds and body was just not use to it yet. Now im not dizzy, but if I were u,i would tell doctor about your symptoms,mays meds are just not right for you.my mom went threw 5 until she found one that works with her body. The chest pain I wouldnt ignore. So call your doctor,and good luck,hope u feel better",
