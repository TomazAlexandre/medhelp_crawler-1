I am unsure of the tracing of the ST interval.I have controlled diabetes, uncontrolled high blood pressure (on the 5th type of medication) and a list of symptoms that identify with MS. I get random sudden pains in my head-CT scan on thursday-finally!I am having daily pain/pressure in my chest and sometimes back. Often relieved with sitting-laying sometimes makes it worse. I sweat uncontrollably with very little exertion. I am exhausted a good part of the time. And I am really tired of feeling like this! I have things to do!Thanks for listening :)",
