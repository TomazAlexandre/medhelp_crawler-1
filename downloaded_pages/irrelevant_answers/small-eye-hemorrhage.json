    "question": "In November I saw an eye specialist. Because I had rust ring in my left eye. The particle was removed and I was given sap to heal it. But in the examination he discovered a small microscopic hemorrhage in my right eye. I had a pressure test and did tests for disease and diabetes. All the tests came back negative. The specialist thinks the small hemorrhage is from heavy lifting because of the kind of work I do. I went back and seen him again for a check up 4 weeks ago. He told me\u00a0\u00a0the left eye is healing good\u00a0\u00a0and the right eye with the hemorrhage, the hemorrhage is getting lighter in color \u201cred spot \u201c and to go back\u00a0\u00a0for a follow up in 6 month. But the problem is. In the last 2 weeks I am having floaters. I think I have had those most of my life but it just seems more in my right eye \u201cthe one with the small microscopic hemorrhage. It\u2019s like a cloudy spot of floates on the out side. Is this from the hemorrhage? And will it clear up?",
