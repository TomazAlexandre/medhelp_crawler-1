            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Is your blood sugar well controlled on the medications? Fluctuations in blood sugar can lead to \"feeling weak\". Are you monitoring your diet? If you are not managing your diet appropriately you can be having peaks and drops in your blood sugar making you feel weak.I recommend speaking with your doctor about your concerns. If your blood sugar is not well controlled, your doctor will be able to help you make the dietary, lifestyle, and medication changes needed to feel yourself again.Cathy",
