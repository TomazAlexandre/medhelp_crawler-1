            "answer": "im not a doctor but it doesnt seem like u have to worry about HIV. why would u think that of all things anyway? just curious...but if the cortizon worked for u then thats a good sign. HIV's initial symptoms are usually internal i.e (fever, flu like symptoms) long before it affects the skin, have u had persistant signs of this?...if not u should be ok, though it is always important to get tested for every std every so often to be safe. hope this helps.",
