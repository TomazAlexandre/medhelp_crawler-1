            "answer": "Hi Doc,You mentioned that Weightlifting can cause LVH. Would you be please more specific? What kind of weightlifting we are talking about? Mild, Moderate or Maximum?About the mild bp, how long will it actually take it to cause at least mild LVH. I know I am asking for you to guess, but I bet your guess will be better than mine.Also, can untreated high normal or borderline blood pressurecause damage to some people?Thank you very much. Really appreciated your comments.Randy",

            "answer": "I am referring to competitive weightlifting.I would not expect mild BP to cause LVH at all, and if it did, only after decades.High normal blood pressure is certainly not desirable for people with diabetes. In otherwise healthy people, it is not as much a problem, though it would of course be better to have normal blood pressure.",
