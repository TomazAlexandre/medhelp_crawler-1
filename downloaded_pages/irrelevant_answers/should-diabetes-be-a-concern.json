Definitely go the doc.If you have unquenchable thirst and therefore peeing alot, a big appetite accompanied by weight loss, and fatigue like nothing else you have experienced, you may be diabetic.

Hopefully nothing serious.Good luck.",

    "question": "Over the past few months, I've been experiencing a few unusual symptoms. As such, I scheduled a Doctors appointment for this coming Friday, but wanted to be prepared for possible causes. This all began back in May when I developed a staph infection/boil. I had it lanced, and was treated with a course of antibiotics. I attributed this to maybe being caused by contact with a friend whom had a staph infection I didn't know about until afterwards. So a few weeks go by, and I have an outbreak of folliculitis on my thighs which I attributed to possibly the summer heat, and wearing boxer briefs. A couple of months later I acquired another boil! At this point I began to worry if maybe there was something else at play that I wasn't considering. After that boil I haven't had any recurrences. Over the summer, I had a few family members tell me that I looked like I'd lost some weight. I'd been going through relationship issues, and hadn't really been eating a whole lot, but for there to be a noticeable loss of weight was disconcerting. In September I moved across country and began a new job. It was relatively stressful being so far from home and trying to adjust, so with the hours I keep, I really don't get as much rest as I should, nor do I eat as properly as I should. At the beginning of October while at work, I nearly passed out. I didn't black out completely, but I had the feeling of my hearing fading, the darkening vision, sweating, and feeling weak. I'd been standing in a lab for over an hour. The previous night I'd had little to drink, and that morning I was running late for work, so I didn't have time to eat anything, or grab anything to drink. I was taken to a hospital and told that more than likely it was just a vasovagal syncope. However, given the unusual symptoms I'd had in the past, it made me wonder if maybe it was something a little more serious. Also, I've noticed a dull ache in my lower right side that comes and goes. I've been monitoring my urine output which has been between 6 & 7 times a day. I haven't really had any excessive feeling of being thirsty, but I have noticed that I've been generally down and irritable lately. My problem is that I'm not sure how much of this can be attributed to anxiety & stress over the move and starting a new job, or how much of it could be attributed to the possibility of a diabetes. Also I've noticed floaters in my field of vision. I've had them for a while, but never really connected them to a possible problem. I'm just wondering if I should raise diabetes as a possible concern during my visit, or am I just grasping at straws in an attempt to connect a series of events? By the way, I'm 22, avg. build and height. In terms of family history, I know of one uncle who has diabetes, and several family members who have had kidney issues such as kidney stones.",
