    "question": "OK, so i have had this going on for about a year now..... and lately its just starting to get on my nerves. At first it didnt bother me, it was still there though, but now that i am trying to get rid of it, its been getting worse. It alwasy feels like i need to pee. I have been to the doctor for a bladder infection, took pills, they didnt work. Then i went to get checked for stds. I was clean. I thought it would be one because i got it right after sex. Then right now i am on pills for a uti, which those arnt working either. If anyone can give me some feedback that would be great. It isnt bad when i am sitting down, only when walking around. It goes away when i have an erection/ during sex. When i drink a lot it feels like not that much is coming out at a given point in time in comparision to how much i drank.",
