            "answer": "When our age getting older, the chance to get pregnant is harder..our eggs are less and not good eggs...you might not ovulate at all.... If you and your husband tried to conceive more than 6 months, both of you should consult the specialist...Here are some tips you might want to know:Get a thorough blood, urine, blood pressure, diabetes test done.Have a thorough gynecological exam done and talk to your ob/gyn that you are planning to conceive.Have a family history ready for your doctor. If miscarriages have taken place in the past, then share this information with your doctor. Ditto with seizures, high blood pressure, diabetes, or any chronic medical conditions. Also provide a list of all medication (short-term and long-term), vitamins, and 'natural' or 'health' herbs, pills, drinks, etc.Take vitamins your doctor prescribes for 3 months before you plan on conceiving. These contain, among other things, folic acid, which is critical for the development for the fetus.Stop drinking alcohol, smoking, and/or drugs, if you use any of these intoxicants. Ditto for your significant other, whose sperm quality is affected by these habits. There is no such thing as 'moderate' smoking or drugs. Planning for pregnancy calls for complete cessation of these activities before, during, and after pregnancy.Get on a regular routine for sleeping, eating, exercising, and relaxing. Stress works against getting pregnant and maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Once the baby is out, routine is out of the question for the next 18 years or so.If overweight (have the doctor tell you what normal is, with body fat measurements, charts, etc.), focus on losing weight first by dieting and exercising, both in moderation.Excess weight may lead to increased chances for gestational diabetes as well as difficult labor. To make your plan foolproof, consult with a dietician to ensure you are getting the very best of nutrients in the right portions.Attend yoga classes two to three times a week for both mind and body, i.e., flexibility, strength, breath control, relaxation, and focus. Get regular massages to relax further.My husband and I tried to conceive for 21 months... took all fertility medicines and nothing work... Finally after those months of trying, we decided to take a break and take off all kind of medicines... then i got pregnant unexpected..\u00a0\u00a0I guess that when you do not think about it.. you are getting it...Good luck to you and don't give up hope....",

            "answer": "I know exactly how you feel - I gained quite a bit of weight after getting married.\u00a0\u00a0I have to tell you what my re said about weight gain - she told me that there's actually very little known about how weight affects fertility.\u00a0\u00a0It's different w/actual obesity - that can be more affected than just a higher bmi.I was just a bit younger than you when I started my ttc journey.\u00a0\u00a0Mine's a bit different as I already had children and had my tubes tied so I was forced immediately to turn to ART.\u00a0\u00a0Probably more than anything the culprit is the age of your eggs.\u00a0\u00a0I learned this all too well during my journey & ended up resorting to donor eggs in order to get pregnant & increase my chances of not miscarrying.I'm not advocating donor eggs in any way, shape or form.\u00a0\u00a0I highly suggest that you bypass seeing a ob/gyn and head straight to a re (reproductive endocrinologist).\u00a0\u00a0He/she will be able to give a very clear picture of your general health, your husband's sperm, your ovarian reserve, etc which are necessary as to assess where you are in the respects of fertility.The rule of thumb is to try ttc for a few months and if not successful, then head to the fertility specialists.\u00a0\u00a0You can consult your ob-gyn to get a good recommendation.\u00a0\u00a0It may take some time & be a little difficult but it's all worth it.\u00a0\u00a0The best of luck to you!P.S.\u00a0\u00a0Some additional thoughts - if you do end up going to a regular doctor, have them do a thyroid test on you - sometimes unexplained weight gain can be caused by an underactive thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0This can also affect fertility.\u00a0\u00a0It's one of the tests that's done by a re.\u00a0\u00a0Also, start taking prenatal vitamins and folic acid.\u00a0\u00a0This can only help when you get pregnant.",

            "answer": "Thanks Ladies for the information! Both me and my husband have gone to the Dr. to make sure that everything was fine! The only thing that I am waiting to get a call back from is to see if my Tubes are blocked or not. My husband and I decided not to do any injections because it is really too exspensive and also it's not an guarantee that I will become pregnant. I haven't done that much research on donor eggs because my husband trusts and believes that the Lord will do it the natural way (I do too but as I get older, the more my faith fails me in this area). also my period came on 8/20 and went off on 8/23 witch is unusual for me because I am still a 5 day girl! I won't take a pregnancy test because I don't want to be disappointed once again!!Well again thanks for the advice and I will let you know the statis if my tubes are blocked or not!Tat187",

    "question": "Hi Ladies over 40:)I am hoping that some one can give me help with trying to get pregnante? MY husband and I have been trying and thus far nothing is working. I thought it was going this time this month in August, but once again nothing! My husband and I have been married for 2 yrs now 8/11 and neither of us have children, my husband is 37 and I am 44. I have\u00a0\u00a0gained a little weight since we've been married but am working hard to get it off. To see me one would think I don't need to loose anything but when you were once 145 pds and now 170 pds, trust me I need to loose some!Can anyone give me suggesting? I check for ovulation, body temperature, eating right as much as possible (every once in awhile I need some junk food but that's every once in awhile!Thanks in advance for any suggestions:)Tet187",
