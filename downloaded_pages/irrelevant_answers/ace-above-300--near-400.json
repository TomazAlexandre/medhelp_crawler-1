            "answer": "Well, I actually was wondering if there was something other than sarcoidosis that could cause this.\u00a0\u00a0Usually sarcoidosis should show in a chest x-ray or the gallium scan, as I was explained by medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0I am awaiting the results of a blood test from last week and if the ACE levels are still elevated then I am to undergo some sort of bronchial lavage, where they would stick a tube down into my lungs in order to acquire and sample fluids from my lungs.I wonder if a gallium scan would show uptake in pretty much any area of sarcoid activity.\u00a0\u00a0I'm at a loss.\u00a0\u00a0Just so confused and frustrated for feeling like this.\u00a0\u00a0My cognitive functions have been on the decline for quite a while and the pain is draining.Thanks for you reply.\u00a0\u00a0Any MDs out there have any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested negative for HIV and tuberculosis.\u00a0\u00a0My metabolic panel is generally within normal ranges.",

    "question": "Hi,My serum ACE levels are extremely high, off the charts.\u00a0\u00a0About 3 months ago it was above 400, 1 month ago it was in the 300s.\u00a0\u00a0According to a rheumatologist, this is extremely high.\u00a0\u00a0Chest x-rays and urine calcium levels were normal.\u00a0\u00a0I had a full body gallium scan and that was normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having the most horrible symptoms for the past few years, including extreme fatigue, irritability, memory loss, hair loss, numbness in my limbs, heavy and weak limbs, muscle aches, loss of coordination, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It has progressed to the point where I am no longer able to function at work and had to quit several jobs.Am I missing something?\u00a0\u00a0Is there another possible reason for my ACE levels to be so high?\u00a0\u00a0All the other possible culprits, as listed below, are nearly impossible because I have none of the risk factors or symptoms.ThanksActive histoplasmosisAlcoholic cirrhosisAmyloidosisAsbestosisBerylliosisDiabetesGaucher's diseaseHodgkin's diseaseHyperthyroidismIdiopathic pulmonary fibrosisLeprosyMyelomaPrimary biliary cirrhosisPulmonary embolismSclerodermaSilicosisTuberculosis",
