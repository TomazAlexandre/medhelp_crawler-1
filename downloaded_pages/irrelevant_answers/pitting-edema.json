            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.What you have described sounds like a dependent edema.\u00a0\u00a0Have you finished taking the Lasix? Did you notice any difference at all when taking it?\u00a0\u00a0You could try wearing support stockings when you are at work and you know you are going to be on your feet for long periods.\u00a0\u00a0This can help reduce your swelling.\u00a0\u00a0Also, frequent exercise can help.\u00a0\u00a0If you are still having the edema despite the Lasix, then you should follow up with your primary care doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.Bridget",

    "question": "Hey!\u00a0\u00a0 I'm a 28 year old female and am probably 40 pounds overweight.\u00a0\u00a0For the past couple months I have had a problem with pitting edema, mainly on my left left ankle and calf, but on my right leg a little as well.\u00a0\u00a0A couple weeks ago I finally visited a doctor regarding this issue.\u00a0\u00a0All she did was order blood work to check for diabetes and thyroid problems and all the labs came back good, no problems.\u00a0\u00a0She prescribed Lasix (20mg) to be taken once daily for 30 days.\u00a0\u00a0However, the problem still persist and some days are better than others.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a college student and walking across campus sometimes makes my calf muscles and legs feel really tight, especially my left leg.\u00a0\u00a0My legs feel tired a lot and the left one will have occasional tingling sensations down my leg and into my foot and toes, it feels strange.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on my feet a lot; I work about 30 hours per week (give or take a few) at a job in retail where I'm on my feet 6-8 hours per shift.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if this is something to be concerned about and whether to seek further care regarding it.\u00a0\u00a0It's annoying and worrisome.\u00a0\u00a0What should I do?\u00a0\u00a0And what could be causing this?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
