            "answer": "Yes - your thyroid can atrophy if suppressed - thus leading to needing thyroid replacement forever.\u00a0\u00a0But that is the least of the problems that long-term thyroid overdose can cause!http://www.emedicine.com/emerg/topic800.htmPlease get in to see a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0They have health care centers at colleges and universities and low-cost clinics in the communities (check with the health department or call some clinics to see if they have a sliding-fee schedule).\u00a0\u00a0You are not only risking your thyroid, you are risking your life.",

            "answer": "i've stopped taking it for now and i'm seeing how that goes.\u00a0\u00a0i think if anything changes I'll have to break down and go to the doctor (which will be interesting, b/c there is maybe ONE endocrinologist in this town ,and he is a diabetes specialist.) Anyway, just so everyone knows, I don't have illegal prescription thyroid or anything like levothyroxine.. what I have been taking is this natural supplement stuff that is made from freeze dried cow organs( I read freeze dried things do not excrete hormones) and things like kelp. but anyway, we'll see how going off of it goes.\u00a0\u00a0I was a little tired today, but we'll see.",

    "question": "I recently began college, and was under a lot of stress at that time.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed about 2 mos. in that I had no energy, and was really depressed.\u00a0\u00a0I've since moved home, but was still really tired and had mood swings, so I did two things: I stopped taking Yaz birth control and I started taking Natural Raw Thyroid supplement (I suspected hypothyroidism, because I began gaining weight, even though I worked out like crazy (6 days a week for over an hr. every day) and did not change my diet in the slightest way)). I couldn't get my thyroid tested b/c of insurance issues, but since doing both of these things,I have felt really happy and have lost weight. My mom thinks that if I keep taking the supplement (made with beef glands) my body will shut down its own thyroid production and I will have to be on thyroid supplements forever.\u00a0\u00a0Is she right, or is the supplement okay to take?",
