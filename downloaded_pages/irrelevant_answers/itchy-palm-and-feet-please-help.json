            "answer": "Hi there! It's normal to itch on your palms and feet due to hormones. I had it and almost like a burning itch. I got diagnosed with gestational diabetes so make sure you consult your dr with this to find out what the problem is. But I used Google and freaked myself out thinking it was liver related to! Don't worry about it until you talk to dr and have a diagnosis! Best of luck momma!",
