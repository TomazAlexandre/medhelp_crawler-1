            "answer": "It isn't clear what problem you have in your peripheral retina that needs all the laser. Are you extremely near-sighted? Were you premature and have retinopathy of prematurity? Do you have peripheral lattice degeneration? You need to know your eye diagnoses.Thin areas, small retinal holes or tears are often assymptomatic and you may not have any symptoms at all. Retinal specialists often disagree about when and what holes to treat on the retina.With most things that cause peripheral retinal thinning, it does not lead to bad vision or blindness when the person gets middle aged or older. I would just confirm this with the ophthalmologist the next time you see him/her.The danger symptoms of retinal detachment: Showers of floaters, flashes of light like lightening,\u00a0\u00a0loss of peripheral vision.\u00a0\u00a0Even with your history with all the laser you have had its generally low risk for retinal detachment especially if you don't have any blood relatives with RD.JCH III MD",

No, no one that I know of in my family has RD except my great grandmother but it was also due to diabetes that she lost her vision due to RD. Thank you for your reply.",

    "question": "An opthalmologist told me at age 13 that if I didn't have the proper treatment by the time I am age 30 I would lose my vision.\u00a0\u00a0He never called me for checkups though, and I didn't know of real trouble till age 20 when I went to another doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I am now age 21 and had around 8 trips to the laser room, to fix both eyes all around both peripheries of my retina.\u00a0\u00a0I have many little holes up and right of my right eye and a hole in the bottom of my right and other trouble in my left.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor says that 'usually in the cases like yours trouble doesn't come up for years and years'.\u00a0\u00a0This was after all the lasering has been done.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that it is possible for doctors to forsee trouble.\u00a0\u00a0But 'years and years' is quite vague and what does this mean?\u00a0\u00a0Are these things forseeable or is my doctor just trying to reassure for the present?I get nervous because it seems like trouble is inevitable in my case, and I have always thought that these are emergencies.Also, I have never seen signs of retinal detachment as I have read on all websites (such as lightning flashes, or light flashes like people are taking a picture), only large floaters, and I have had tears and detachments in my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0Is this because I don't look carefully enough or because of where the trouble is located?\u00a0\u00a0I know that where they lasered was all around the peripheries.\u00a0\u00a0After lasering for the past half year I do see wavy vision and some balls of light moving around in various light and times.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor doesn't think these are signs of retinal detachment.\u00a0\u00a0If you can let me know what I should look out for it would be helpful.Thank you.",
