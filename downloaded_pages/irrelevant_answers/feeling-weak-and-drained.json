            "answer": "There are many things that can contribute to extreme fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Of course many serious undiagnosed illnesses can be the culprit, but look at your daily life and see if anything is different that would make you extremely tired.\u00a0\u00a0Stress is exhausting, how old are you?\u00a0\u00a0Are you in school, having mid terms, starting a new job, personal issues, anything stressing you out?\u00a0\u00a0Also too much sleep causes fatigue.\u00a0\u00a0Depression makes you tired all day and not want to get out of bed.\u00a0\u00a0Poor nutrition can also zap your energy levels.\u00a0\u00a0Are you getting enough Vitamin B, protein and iron?\u00a0\u00a0If you eat fast food, or skip daily fruits and veggies, you should try taking a vitamin supplement at the very least.\u00a0\u00a0But eating healthier is the best option.\u00a0\u00a0if you try those options and none seem to help, I would see a doctor as many diseases cause extreme fatigue as well.\u00a0\u00a0 Good Luck!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness. Diabetes too is a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",

    "question": "Ive been feeling extremely drained lately. This isn't nothing new but it has been getting worse. I thought maybe I just wasnt getting enough sleep but Ive started going to bed more or less on time. Well this past Sunday, I went sleep late becuz of Halloween and everything. Went I tried to wake up about 10 to 11 am, I was feeling very very weak. I just felt so mentally and physical drained that when I tried to move, I just layed there limp. I was trying to talk to my Boyfriend but couldn't and so I just ended up laying the still and just fell back to sleep. Then when my boyfriend tried to wake me up again, I felt the same way but not as bad as before. I slowly started to recover. I told my boyfriend about what happened and he was a little concerned but just wrote it off as me being tired.But the way I felt was no reg. feeling as being tired. It was terrible not being able to move or talk because of this feeling of being drained or weak.\u00a0\u00a0This is nothing new to me, but it has def. gotten worse. No matter how much rest I get, I feel like i havent rested in days.What could this be?",
