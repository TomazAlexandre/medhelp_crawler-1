            "answer": "It is possible that your daughter has Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome:This is from my website: www.integrativefertilitymd.com/services.php#ReproductivePCOS can affect 5% of all women and common symptoms include irregular menstrual cycles, increased growth of hair on the body, loss of hair on the head, acne, and weight gain. Based on the 2003 ESHRE/ASRM sponsored Consensus Workshop Group, PCOS is diagnosed in women who meet two of the three following criteria: ovarian dysfunction (not ovulating regularly), hyperandrogenism (increased male type hormones on lab testing or clinically increased hair growth), or polycystic ovaries on ultrasound (ovaries which show multiple small cysts on ultrasound). PCOS is a common cause of infertility and puts women at an increased risk of developing Type 2 diabetes. There is also increased risk of insulin resistance, hypertension, and abnormalities of cholesterol and triglycerides in women with PCOS. Due to these risks, we advise our patients with PCOS to have the complete metabolic assessment with complete lipid panel testing and a two hour glucose tolerance test.Your daughter should have a complete hormone work up including total testosterone, DHEAS and 17-OH progesterone and also be tested for prediabetes or diabetes. She should have an examination and pelvic ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0She can be treated with birth control pills to regulate her period and to decrease the production of hair.\u00a0\u00a0The best birth control pill would be Yasmin which contains a progestin called DSP which will decrease production of testosterone.\u00a0\u00a0Although, Yasmin can help decrease future hair production, the current hair can only be removed by electrolysis or plucking or removal.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest that she a specialist called a Reproductive Endocrinologist because given her hair loss she may have a severe form of PCOS or some other androgen secreting disorder. And not to alarm you but even a androgen secreting ovarian tumour.\u00a0\u00a0So I suggest seeing a specialist.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response and information. I really needed to know where to start. Yes she does\u00a0\u00a0have Polycystic ovarian syndrome and has been on Yasmin and had an ultrasound. But i dont know what to do from there. after the ultrasound, all the doctor mentioned was that she couldnt have any children because she has too many cyst on her ovaries. But never mentioned a follow up or where we go from there. Her hair loss is drastically falling out and her facial hair has drastically gotten worse in the last year.I will start looking immediately for specialists in this area. However, what is the next step if the birth control pills dont work.I really appreciate you taking the time to answer my questions, i realize you are very busy.",
