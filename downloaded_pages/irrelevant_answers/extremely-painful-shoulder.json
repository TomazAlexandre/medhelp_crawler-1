            "answer": "Hi, probably it is frozen shoulder due to inflammation, scarring, thickening, and shrinkage of the capsule that surrounds the normal shoulder joint. Any injury to the shoulder can lead to frozen shoulder, including tendonitis, bursitis, and rotator cuff injury. Frozen shoulders occur more frequently in patients with diabetes, chronic inflammatory arthritis of the shoulder, or after chest or breast surgery or autoimmunity. Long-term immobility of the shoulder joint can put people at risk to develop a frozen shoulder.Although, immobility adds to the problem hence continue mild passive exercises. Please continue diclofen too. Also visit website for more information http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/frozen-shoulder/DS00416/DSECTION=1",

            "answer": "Hi Maddy!I'm sorry to hear about this pain of yours, specially if it really affects your daily life.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with bhups1 that this maybe a case of frozen shoulder, however, an exact cause should be pinpointed.\u00a0\u00a0Causes may include arthritis from overwork, primary muscle and nerve problems (myopathy and neuropathy), or connective tissue diseases.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you discuss with your doctor regarding these and don't end your visit without you having a reasonable explanation.I suggest also to continue your exercises since if these are stopped, the stiffness might progress quickly.\u00a0\u00a0The medications would also help in alleviating the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Also, ask your doctor about corticosteroid shots through the joint.\u00a0\u00a0This treatment has been proven to work for people with your condition.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Regards and God bless...",

    "question": "HiI had a stiff right shoulder for about two years -didn't go to the Dr as it wasn't too bad just a bit irritating. About 8 weeks ago my shoulder started hurting a lot and i went to the Drs and was prescribed diclofenac. I went back to the Dr a couple of weeks ago as it was getting stiffer and was given more diclofenac, stretching exercises to do and have got an appointment on the 23rd with a physiotherapist. For the last week the pain has been really bad - I have very limited movement now and the front of my shoulder (the ball) is very painful to touch and seems swollen compared to my other shoulder- i have now started geting aching down my arm and am having trouble doing the simplest of things with my right arm and have trouble sleeping due to throbbing pain. I have been doing\u00a0\u00a0all the exercises but things are getting worse not better. I am 39 and have not had any accident etc that might have started this off. The question is ,should i be resting it or should i be exercising it? I would be grateful for any advice- Thnakyou",
