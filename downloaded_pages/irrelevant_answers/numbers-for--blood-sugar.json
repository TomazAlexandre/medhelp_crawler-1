            "answer": "Thank you. It appears that one cannot link directly to a source page on the ADA web site. Yours kept taking me to the main page. Using the ADA search button, I found the reference using key words \"check glucose\" which brought up a bunch of useful information. In fact it returned 750 hits.For those of you reading this, use key word(s) in the ADA site search button to retrieve information that are \"not\" seen on their main page and main page sub-listing categories. Its not the most intuitive of sites to navigate.And, be sure to check with your lab/doctor on your ranges. My lab, Quest, says my A1c should be <6%, fasting glucose 60-159 mg/dl. The latter numbers seemed odd (low & too high) and I have tripled checked and this is what Quest uses. However, I still try to keep it below 125 and do most of the time.",

            "answer": "This is what is on that page at ADAChecking Your Blood Glucose--------------------------------------------------------------------------------People with diabetes work to keep their blood sugar (glucose) as near to normal as possible. Keeping your blood glucose in your target range can help prevent or delay the start of diabetes complications such as nerve, eye, kidney, and blood vessel damage.When you learned you had diabetes, you and your health care team worked out a diabetes care plan. The plan aims to balance the foods you eat with your exercise and, possibly, diabetes pills or insulin. You can do two types of checks to help keep track of how your plan is working. These are blood glucose checks and urine ketone checks.Blood Glucose Monitoring ChecksBlood glucose monitoring is the main tool you have to check your diabetes control. This check tells you your blood glucose level at any one time. Keeping a log of your results is vital. When you bring this record to your health care provider, you have a good picture of your body's response to your diabetes care plan. Blood glucose checks let you see what works and what doesn't. This allows you and your doctor, dietitian, or nurse educator to make needed changes.Here is a table that lists blood glucose ranges for adults with diabetes:Glycemic controlA1C<7.0%Preprandial plasma glucose (before a meal)70\u2013130 mg/dl (5.0\u20137.2 mmol/l)Postprandial plasma glucose (after a meal)<180 mg/dl (<10.0 mmol/l)Blood pressure<130/80 mmHgLipidsLDL<100 mg/dl (<2.6 mmol/l)Triglycerides<150 mg/dl (40 mg/dl (>1.1 mmol/l)Who Should Check?Experts feel that anyone with diabetes can benefit from checking their blood glucose. The American Diabetes Association recommends blood glucose checks if you have diabetes and are:taking insulin or diabetes pillson intensive insulin therapypregnanthaving a hard time controlling your blood glucose levelshaving severe low blood glucose levels or ketones from high blood glucose levelshaving low blood glucose levels without the usual warning signs",
