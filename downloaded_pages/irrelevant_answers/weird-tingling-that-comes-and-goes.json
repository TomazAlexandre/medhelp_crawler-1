            "answer": "Just peeking around and noticed your post. Have you had your thyroid levels tested? I was waking up with numb hands and also experienced hands falling asleep while I in bed asleep. It was carpal tunnel due to hypothyroid. I also have tingling in my feet on and off throughout the day and night and some tingling in my back at night. Back exam and film indicate no back/disc problems. All my blood labs are normal except for thyroid and thyroid antibodies. Low B12 can also cause tingling, as can diabetes. Having your MD run extensive labs might help. That's how my thyroid condition was diagnosed. Good luck!",

            "answer": "I hope your MD can make a diagnosis from labs. I know how frustrating and frightening strange stymptoms can be, especially tingling!!. Let us know if it's a thyroid problem. Thyroid isn't what someone suspects when one's\u00a0\u00a0feet or hands start to tingle, but tingling feet was my first hypothryroid symptom! Shortly after I developed carpal tunnel and a few more common hypo symptoms. You might also have a back exam and films as I did to rule out nerve entrapment and disc problems. Good luck!!!",

            "answer": "I also was just diagnosed with recurring carpal tunnel. I had my surgery in 98 and after a few years had off and on pain. Now i have swelling of the wrist and my 2 EMG's showed slowing of the median nerve. I do not know what they are going to do for me as of yet. I also now have pain all the way up to my shoulder/neck and have all the symptoms i had before with the carpal tunnel. They keep telling me that it is very rare for it to come back, but yet i hear of so many that have it return. They do not want to do surgery again, as it may cause damage. It is my dominant hand so now it is causing trouble with me returning to work unless i get light duty with no use of Rt hand or repetition. I am curious as to what my company is going to find for me. I also go to PT/OT 4 times a week and have no relief. I use a TENS unit that my workers comp. purchaced for me that does relieve it somewhat. The pain is AWFUL, and debilitating to do anything.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

My B12 levels are fine. That only leaves carpal tunnel or what...MS? Also I noticed..stuff is dropping from my hands...I had a dish of cat food I was going to put down on the floor and the whole thing just flew out of my hands!\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any pain in my hands otherwise. I notice that after I use the vacuum cleaner I have the same tingling in my hand depending on which hand I hold the vacuum.",

            "answer": "I have carpal tunnel (from hypothyroid), and I agree that it does sound like carpal tunnel. I also worried about MS due to my symptoms, but after researching MS it seems that MS has MANY specific symptoms including rather strange visual problems that you don't seem to have, so don't torture yourself!!!! Focus on what you've had a tendency to have: carpal tunnel, back and neck problems and have MDs exam/test you for one of those it the cause!! Good luck!",

    "question": "Anyone have any ideas as to why I would be gettiing episodic tingling sensations all over my hands. Sometimes this can happen to my right hand (can't be carpal tunnel - I already had the carpal tunnel surgery years back) and left hand. This morning I was laying quietly in bed (flat on my back) when my right hand started getting numb and tingly- this lasted for 7 min. Sometimes this happens after I use the vacuum cleaner, can be my left or right hand. This is kinda scary and annoying too. Background: I'm 55, female, slight diabetic, back/neck ddd, fibro,\u00a0\u00a0don't think I ever had lyme disease as I live in the concrete jungles of a major city and never even seen a tick.",
