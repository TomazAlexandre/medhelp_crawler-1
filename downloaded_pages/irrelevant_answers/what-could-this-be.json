            "answer": "Hi,Hope you are feeling better.The problem with your lower extremities is related to herniated discs in your lower back. However numbness and cold feeling in the arms and shoulders seem to be due to neuropathy. It is important to rule out diabetes and B12 deficiency as both these conditions can cause peripheral neuropathy.There is also a possibility that you may be suffering from sleep apnea and sinusitis. Waking up in the middle of the night gasping for breath is quite suggestive of sleep apnea.Do you snore at night?If yes the possibility of sleep apnea is quite strong. Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor or seek a second opinion. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi cj,These symptoms are symptoms that are caused by pinched nerves, but it might be that there is also something else going on there.My suggestion is to ask your doctor to send you for an MRI **WITH CONTRAST**.I have neuro-sarcoidosis, which is a systemic disease and have had all types of nerve symptoms, but neither the x-ray, nor the MRI showed anything but a perfectly healthy spine.\u00a0\u00a0There is no mechanical problem with my back, but fortunately my neurosurgeon realised that there has to be more to it, since I couldn't even walk on my toes.\u00a0\u00a0My heel would just fall through.So he sent me back for another MRI, but this time with contrast.\u00a0\u00a0All they do is give you an injection, and a few minutes later they send you through the MRI tunnel.The contrast MRI showed that my nerves were thickened, and there were nodules growing on the tips of the lower 'cauda equina' nerves.Have it checked out.\u00a0\u00a0You might have a mechanical problem, but there might also be a masked systemic condition.\u00a0\u00a0The contrast fluid just lights up the nerves, so that you can see them properly.Good luck, I hope you get a solution for your problem.- Ingrid",

    "question": "Im 32 years old and 2 years ago started having trouble with my left leg. After being told it was all in my head my leg finally gave out and I couldn't walk for sometime. One year later in 2007 I was sent for a C-scan and it was found that I had herniation of my lower discs and that I had pinched nerves on different levels. Since , I have continued to have severe pain in my leg and it is now in most of my joints. I have been put on epilepsy medication to control the pain. It takes away the numbness but the joint pain is still there. I am now having bizzaar problems with my neck and head. Severe numbness in the left side of my face. My left arm and shoulder always feel cool , almost like a breeze is blowing over them, At times it feels like they are on fire. I have also started developing problems getting air at night and often wake up gasping for breath. I have alot of pressure in my head as well and sometimes it feels as if something is scraping my sinuses. I have seen a doctor about all the new symptoms and without an exam or anything they automatically say that it is because of my lower back. Im not buying it but they keep going right to my spine without checking for anything else. I also forgot to mention that I can sometimes feel almost like a fluid in my neck when I turn my head. If anyone has any ideas or any knowledge of a doctor in the london ontario area , I need help this is inface ruining my life and im quite scared.",
