            "answer": "I'm under the impression that our liver is a filter for our blood. If I'm not mistaken, the endocrine glands are primarily responsible for our hormone production.I suppose improper filtering of toxins from the system due to a poorly functioning liver could have an adverse effect upon them.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the Pancreas, and I think the Adrenal gland, are close to the liver, so I suppose an enflamed/enlarged liver might affect them in that manner.One way to tell if it is having any affect is to get tested.\u00a0\u00a0If I recall correctly when I was tested counts and motility are the biggest factors.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, as was the case in my situation, infertility can not be explained by medical science.\u00a0\u00a0I've never heard about the liver being a concern though.",
