            "answer": "They won't tell you you're too big to carry a baby, and if they do tell them to **** off and find a new doctor. That for one is very rude, and no doctor should ever say that. They may tell you to watch what you eat and set an amount that is healthy for you to gain. I wouldn't try to lose any more weight since you are pregnant, and you really need to see a doctor so you can get started on seeing how baby is doing and prenatal care. And like I said if the doctor is rude to you, change doctors, you don't have to stick with just one doctor.",

            "answer": "I don't think you're too big to cary a baby. I think the toughest thing you will have to deal with is staying on the diet. I eat constantly, especially lately, I don't know this kid must be growing to much I am measuring a month ahead I just can't stop eating. Anyway, that's my problem, you shouldn't try to starve yourself or exercise too much to try and lose wieght. It's not healthy. You could go for a short walk every day and do some stretching, keeping off the soda is good. I think you'll be fine though. You might end up with high blood pressure while pregnant or gestational diabetes but you can see a nutritionist to help you with a diet that will keep you healthy and keep you from gaining too much while also giving the baby what it needs. You should be fine though. As smjmekg said, if your doctor give you a hard time about your wieght or treats you bad change doctors. THey're not there to critisize you but to help you through your pregnancy.",
