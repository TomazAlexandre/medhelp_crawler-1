Based on an experience with our son when he was hospitalized with RSV as a baby, we were told he had high blood sugar but that he wasn't presenting like a diabetic child and that it was most likely from the illness. The nurse told us an illness can cause a rise in blood sugar to abnormal levels if it's severe enough.",
