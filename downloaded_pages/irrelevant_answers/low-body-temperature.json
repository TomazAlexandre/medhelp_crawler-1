            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, not all human beings have the perfect bookish body temperature.\u00a0\u00a0A person can have a \u2018normal body temperature\u2019 that would become lower in certain instances. Another person can have a lower temperature without any cause.Since you have temperature fluctuations on the lower side with abnormal perception of heat at a lower temperature the first things to be ruled out are thyroid disorders, adrenal gland problems, anemia, diabetes, hypoglycemia, liver diseases, low Vit B12, and vasovagal attacks.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you for answering.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my question is really, \"If average people have an official fever at, say 102 degrees, how do I know when I have an actual fever?\"\u00a0\u00a0Is a fever for me at the same temperature as people whose normal temp is 98.6, or is it when my usual temperature is elevated four or five degrees?I am healthy without any of the above maladies, but I do have occasional flare-ups of uveitis and scleritis.",

    "question": "My usual body temperature is around 95.6, (at least since my mid-40's when I first took it myself and started asking nurses what the thermometer read -- I don't remember my mother ever commenting on my temp when I was a child).\u00a0\u00a0I *feel* feverish when my temperature rises to 97 or so.\u00a0\u00a0So, how is a fever actually determined when one's usual body temperature is three points below average?\u00a0\u00a0I would probably be burned to a crisp if I ever reached the temperature that is considered \"fever.\"\u00a0\u00a0This becomes a problem for me when reporting symptoms to a medical office and the person on the other end starts laughing themselves silly about my \"fever\" of 98 degrees.",
