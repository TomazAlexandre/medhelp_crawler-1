            "answer": "hi,you can google diet and diabetes.Essentially your diet should be very very low in refined carbs and sugars. Small portions of complex carbs, vegetables (but not the starchy ones), protein and fats. Fruit should be limited to small amounts. Fruit juices and soft drinks and any sweetened drinks should be avoided.",

            "answer": "I did look up diabetes to further investigate it. I already know a little basic knowledge on this. On my fathers side of the family 2 of his sisters have diabetes. Genetics are mixed in the factor. The 15.% I don't understand. Online sources were saying something about 10% is diabetic. I have the gallbladder stone that was to large for them to get out still inside me. On March 3, I'm having the procedure done where they are going inside to take a look at the pancreus, the gallbladder stone and the liver. My liver was inflamed. I also have fatty liver. It's not from alcohol or being obese. I'm 5\"5 and wt. 130. I don't drink alcohol and never did that much. I read diabetes can cause gallbladder stones and fatty liver. I know I do have anxiety and worry about things to much at times when it comes to things like this. I have to wait a 6 weeks to get retested. My white blood cells were also elevated in the hospital and I had no symptoms of a virus or cold. Maybe the cells were going to the gallbladder because the area was hurt and not working.",

    "question": "Today the endocrinologist showed me blood work I had done a few weeks ago. It showed I probably had a virus at the time because all my white blood cells were increased. My blood glucose was 122 and the blood level was 15.5%. The cortical level was a couple points high-high norm range is 19. Mine was 21.4. I have not been feeling well for the past few years. I have most symptoms of hypoglycemia and some of hyperglycemia. I am always fatigued. I have been through so many tests and procedures. I'm a 26 year old female. After I had a jaw surgery last year in July all my digestion issues started. My body would not digest anything I out in it. I started getting a lot of pain and it persisted. I had discomfort, bloating, and gurgling constantly. My body cannot have a BM on it's own since than. I had to go on a liquid diet for a month after the jaw surgery. I went to the hospital a few weeks ago from enduring so much pain in the abdomen. I found out my gallbladder was swelled with plenty of gallbladder stones. I had my gallbladder removed and I do feel better. I can eat and drink without being in so much pain. One of the gallbladder stones is stuck in the bile duct going to the liver. My liver enzymes were high at the hospital. The gallbladder stone is still inside there and they couldn't get it out. They put a stent in there and I'm taking a medication that may help dissolve the stone. I am wondering if my gallbladder is the reason why my blood work was high? 60% of my fathers family has diabetes including himself being on the borderline. Maybe these results are a forewarning I might get diabetes later or I don't know if I have it now. I am getting this blood work done again in a month. 80-120 use to be normal. 70-100 is normal now. Maybe they decreased the range just because the pharmaceutical companies want people taking more medication so they can make more money. I am worried about having diabetes now. I don't have the best diet but it's not totally bad. I fasted 16 hours before the blood work. With all this information it's going over my head.",
