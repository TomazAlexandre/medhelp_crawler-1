            "answer": "Thank you I knew what she meant I just did not explain it well. I actually had gotten to the point where I thought perhaps I should stop tx because I was responding but was it worth it with all of the orther side problems. Anemia as well as side effects and being diabetic. But then I got this news and it looks like it is responding very well. I am a little concerned about what is going to happen to tx while I am off Riba. I will only be off of it until I can get my blood count up.Thanks for all of your info.Easy",

            "answer": "Congratulations on your VL. I think that is great. Your HbA1c can't be trusted because your RBCs are being destroyed by the Ribavirin and consequently they are not living as long as assumed - 120 days. The sugar in your system sticks to the hemoglobin in the RBC and stays there for the life of the RBC. An RBC that does not live 120 days will have less sugar attached than if it lived longer and had more time to accumulate sugar. Thus your HbA1c will be lower than it would be if they were looking at normal RBCs. The point is that you should monitor your glucose frequently and trust this more than your HbA1c until you are off the TX for 6 months or longer. Take post prandial readings (90 - 120 minutes after meals) until you know how your body is going to respond to carb intake and that may mean getting a little needle happy till you have a good grip on it. Again, congratulations on your great response. Mike",

            "answer": "Wow! I was sure from the title that this would be bad news.... but instead it's GREAT, as Tony the Tiger would say.BUT - I think you owe it to yourself to run - not walk - to your next appontment with a specialist - be that a hemotologist or hepatologist. It's working, so lets keep the toes to the fire.As I recall platelets were your biggest issue. Let's ask others, but I think the platelet drop is INF induced more than RIBA induced. Stopping the RIBA will boost your hgb, which will make you feel better for sure - but I don't recall hgb as being your critical issue.Please consider what Jim said and try to get another opinion right away.",

            "answer": "Congratulations on your viral load test. But do yourself a favor and get a second opinion ASAP from an experienced hepatologist regarding the ribavirin, platelets, ect. Some doctors intervene with drugs like Procrit, Neupogen, Neumega, etc. before they reduce or discontinue meds. You've probably heard of the 80/80/80 rule. Well, if you stop taking riba for the next 6 months like the nurse suggests, your chances of SVR will probably be reduced. What she should have meant is that riba stays in your system for up to six months, but that doesn't mean the dose remains therapeutic. All the best.-- Jim",

But I wonder if it's at effective levels for 6 months?Also had a diabetes problem - many believe directly related to HCV.\u00a0\u00a0Pre TX A1C 11.7. Tested aic again, couple of weeks after undetect 12 week PCR was at 6.3 - Endo said I'm in range.\u00a0\u00a0Take glucose reading (more holes in my body ) few times a day and am ok - even after meals. This concerns me since I have no idea what will happen after TX. (See Mike's comments). Hoping that HCV-free plus a few months de-tox from TX will show diabetes resolved by being VL free.You sound really close to where you want to be.Did you have diabetes before HCV? Or develop during HVC, if there's a way for you to know.",

            "answer": "Found outAnisocytosis means that the red cells are of unequal size. It is a feature of many anemias, and other blood conditions, and does not have much diagnostic value. The 'red cell distribution width' (RDW) is a quantitative measure of the degree of anisocytosis. The RDW is useful in the differential diagnosis of microcytic anemia. Most cases of iron deficiency have a raised RDW, and most cases of thalassemia trait have a normal RDW.Guess I get that drift.\u00a0\u00a0Just in case anybody else wanted to know what it meant.",

    "question": "Hi Everyone. This is Easywriter and I just got a call from my Dr. What I thought was a 2 log drop or almost a 3 log drop actually turned out to be even better. I had originally had a PCR Viral Load of 519,000. But at 12 weeks my Viral Load dropped to 289. I thought that meant 289,000 but my DR called and said no it's 289 period. So I am almost undetectable. Yay.He wants me to continue my redipen shots at 150 ml at 3.5 injection, stop Ribavarin completely (I did last Wed Night 11/2/05) and see a hematologist and have blood work done weekly.Stopping the Ribavarin concerned me but I have been feeling better since I stopped taking it. I am still anemic and that is messing with my Diabetes and my Blood Sugar levels. My latest A1C was 4.2 so that is low also and my Diabetic Dr is concerned about that as well as my low platelets. They said no wonder my A1C is low because there is no blood to carry the sugar in. (smile). I did talk to the Be in Charge Nurse at Redi Pen and she said that the riba contiues in your system for six months and they often have people go off either for a short period of timebut in the long run it shouldn't hurt me. I don't know but at least my Dr is stepping up to the plate. I feel that a lot of this stuff would have been avoided had we done blood work early to know what is going on. He said the hematologist might want to presribe some things but we will wait and see. I guess 289 VL is a good thing Huh!! Thanks Everyone. Easy",
