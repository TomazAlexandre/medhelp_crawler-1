            "answer": "I was just reading some stuff on PCOS which I also have. I just stopped taking BCP for it on Saturday due to other side effects from that. So, I read that to help with the PCOS which brings on high blood pressure, high triglycerides, heart problems, cancer, bunches of stuff, that you should change your diet to low carbs. You shoudl find out if you are insulin resistant. Foods that are high in carbs, if not eaten in moderation, and sweets, will store fat in you belly. Even if you do excercise regularly. I wasn't able to lose any weight that I had gained until I went on the BCP. I've also heard that even when they do blood tests sometimes to check your horomone levels, it can come back normal, even if it's not. I would have them check it again. It sounds to me like most of your symtoms are just arising from your PCOS.",

            "answer": "Hi, I don't know a lot about this, but did they test for type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the symptoms seem related.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I am really concerned about your headaches and blurred vision.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had an MRI.\u00a0\u00a0Not to make you terribly more anxious, but I have heard of women having brain tumors and having it affect their reproductive systems,depression, and muscle weakness.\u00a0\u00a0I would maybe look into as well if you can find one specialist who is willing to take into consideration that you feel this is all related.\u00a0\u00a0You need someone working to find the underlying cause to all, not trying to fix each individual problem.\u00a0\u00a0Hope that helps, don't want to give any poor advice, but just some thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and I hope you come across the right doctor that will find the answer.\u00a0\u00a0You shouldn't be living in such misery.",

    "question": "I am having problems that no one has been able to help me with, and now I'm desperate. I think that my symptoms may all be related, although I've been seeing different doctors for them. I am having lower abdominal/pelvic pain (sharp), and the area under my belly button is sometimes sore to the touch. I get chronic UTI's and yeast infections. I have severe vaginal dryness and I went from a great libido, to NO libido at all. I do have endometriosis and PCOS. I've gained weight in a short amount of time even though my eating habits have not changed. My triglycerides have been going up and down irratically. I'm having high white blood cell levels in my vagina and occasional discharge,but I am neg. for STD's. I had poland syndrome when I was younger. I've been having acne,which I never used to suffer from. My vision has been blurry and i've been getting sharp pains in my head and left eye. Intercourse is painful. My blood pressure is high all of the sudden. I'm always swollen on my left side (mostly facially) and recently my mons pubis has become overly large to the point where something needs to be done about it!\u00a0\u00a0I also get severe muscle aches and joint pain.I had my hormone levels checked and they were fine. Same thing with my thyroid and liver and kidneys, everything turns out ok in the tests, yet obviously something is wrong! It's so frustrating! Please help! I'm only 28 for goodness sakes, and I feel like I'm 80.",
