            "answer": "Hello,Since the left side is getting numb, it is better to consult a physician or a neurologist and get nerve conduction velocity test to rule out any neurological cause or parasthesia skin. It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
