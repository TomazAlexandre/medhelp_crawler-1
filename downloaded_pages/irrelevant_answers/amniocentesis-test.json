It really isn't bad.\u00a0\u00a0And I'm sure the benefits outweigh the risks in your case cause it sounds like your Dr is checking for lung maturity.\u00a0\u00a0Just be prepared to relax and take it easy the day of the procedure.",

            "answer": "I also had 1 at about 16 weeks for genetic test and it wasn't as bad as I thought it would be and its over very fast..the only discomfort I had came from the baby kicking the needle lol and they don't go thru your navel if that's what you may have heard..they use the ultrasound to find the biggest pocket of fluid and go in there..just relax and it will be ok",

            "answer": "I had one done when I was 19yrs old around 32 wks. It made me.feel very nervous to the point where I almost passed out, just seeing the needle and thinking it would pop my stomach. But like the other ladies said, its not painful and its.pretty fast. Its more worrisome thinking it might cause miscarriage...so just take care of yourself afterwards and stay in bed as much as possible.",

    "question": "I am currently 34 weeks pregnant and I am scheduled for an amniocentesis test in 2 weeks because my doctors don't want me going past 36 weeks due to high blood pressure, type 1 diabetes (NOT GESTATIONAL) and I had a still born in August of last year. I have heard a lot of horror stories about this test and the pain it causes. I am already terrified of needles (yes, even being diabetic for almost 7 years I'm still horrified by them), and I know this procedure is a long needle inserted through your stomach into the uterus to extract amniotic fluid. Of course my doctor says \u201dOh you will be fine,\u201d and \u201d I've done a lot of them,\u201d but that doesn't help coming from someone who hasn't had it done TO them. If anyone can give me some advise on what to expect and exactly how painful this is actually going to be it would be greatly appreciated!!",
