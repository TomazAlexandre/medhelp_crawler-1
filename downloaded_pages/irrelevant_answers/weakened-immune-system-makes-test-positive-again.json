    "question": "A few years ago my girlfriend had been told that she showed she had hepatitis b antibodies, but had already cleared the infection and was now immune.Just the other day she got a call from her doctor and told her she had active hepatitis b again. Is there any way that this is possible? She is also diabetic, and we wonder if a weakened immune system would let the virus reassert itself, but I have never heard of that happening before. I tested completely negative- no infection past or present. Does anybody have any ideas?",
