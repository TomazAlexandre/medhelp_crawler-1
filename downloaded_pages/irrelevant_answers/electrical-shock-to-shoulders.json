Affected sensory nerves may also present with tingling, numbness, and pain which can be described as sensation of wearing an invisible \"glove\" ; burning, freezing, or electric-like; and extreme sensitivity to touch. If this persists, check with your doctor for proper evaluation. Take care and do keep us posted.",
