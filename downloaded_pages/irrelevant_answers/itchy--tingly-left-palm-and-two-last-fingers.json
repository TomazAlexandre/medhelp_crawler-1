            "answer": "I am having the same problem except it is my right palm and my left middle fingertip. I mentioned this to my boss today who happens to be a podiatrist and he said it could be a disc herniation that is causing this. Not sure if this is true or not but I have been in two car accidents over my lifetime.Something you may want to look into.Hope it helps,Kathy",

            "answer": "I have the itchy plam in my left hand, and also experienced numb fingertips in my ring and middle fingers after a long road trip.While the numbness in the fingertips eventually went away, the itchiness in the palm often returns. My father is a retired orthopedist, and I had previously complained of elbow issues (locking elbow, tightness that doesn't allow me to open up the joint as the right elbow). He thinks I may have bone chips/spur in the elbow which might be affecting movement, and now ulnar nerve. As the itching has not become too bad, and the numbness has not returned, I have not yet seen a doctor for xrays, etc, but I may eventually. Perhaps pressure on your ulnar nerve might be the reason you and others are experiencing these symptoms.Sincerely,Paul",
