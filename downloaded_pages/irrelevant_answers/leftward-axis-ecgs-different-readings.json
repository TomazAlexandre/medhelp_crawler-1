            "answer": "If the heart cath is already scheduled that will confirm or rule out what is happening with your heart. It is good to have a heart cath, so you know for sure what is going on. My cousin had a heart cath just because his dad had a fatal heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0There was nothing wrong with my cousin's heart, but just for peace of mind it was worth it to him.",

            "answer": "\"Leftward\" axis relates to the orientation of the heart to the skeletal frame (thorax) and can be due to enlarged left ventricle.. Deviations of QRS (electrical output during systole phase (pumping) axis away from the normal - leftward or rightward - need not necessarily imply any ventricular hypertrophy of the left or right heart. Any factors which, for example, place the heart as a whole in a more horizontal position in theboney thorax will produce a deviation to the left of the electrical axis, whereas factors which place the cardiac mass in a more vertical position in the thoraxIt is now a well accepted ECG principle that axis shifts must be accompanied by increased QRS voltage and/ or ST-T abnormalities (prior heart attack) before being explained as due to ventricular enlargement (dilatation or hypertrophy).Before a diagnosis almost all ECG output needs to be supported with additional clinical evidence.Why is the doctor recommending angioplasty?The other poster stating her cousin has peace of mind with a cath is an understatement for a prognosis of a fatal heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0A cath takes images of lumen (channel of the vessel), but most heart attacks occur from the rupture of soft plaque outside the lumen causing a clot.\u00a0\u00a0The clot breaks away and blocks a vessel causing an MI.\u00a0\u00a0Calcium scoring with a CAT scan (64-slice) provides a numerical metric of soft plaque and studies have shown that there is a degree of validity to the prognosis that correlates heart events to the calcium score.",

    "question": "I was wondering about the ecg's I have had recently. I have had 3 done within 6 months. All 3 showed differences none the same. One was normal, the 2nd stating I had had a previous heart attack and the third said something about \"leftward axis\" which I do not understand. Are all 3 correct. Or should they be ignored. My doctor will be doing a heart cath in a couple of weeks.",
