            "answer": "Google a site Thyroid disease Top Doctors Directory. It lists every state just click and check out the doctor in that area. I would think Chicago should have many. What's nice is there are credible postings also available from people who they treated.Good Luck with your daughter. Sorry it took so long.",

    "question": "My daughter has all the symptoms of Hashimoto's. There is a family history: me, my sister and my mother. Anyway, her TSH is still considered normal (4.5) even though she is suffering terribly and it's breaking my heart. The doctor here, of course, won't do anything because he says the labs are normal. He is a diabetes specialist though. We live in a small town about 50 miles from South Bend, IN and 90 miles from Chicago. Can anyone help me with a recommendation? I've tried all those doctor search sites but they don't list doctors specializing in thyroid disease. Just Endocrinologists in general.Thank you!",
