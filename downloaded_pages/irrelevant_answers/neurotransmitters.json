            "answer": "There are a variety of neurotransmitters involved. Its complex. However, as for psychosis, the thinking up until now was that the brain of people with schizophrenia was overactive in the area of dopamine receptors. All antipsychotics work by lowering the amount of dopamine. However, lowering dopamine, creates a condition clinically similar to Parkinsons' known as tardive dyskinesia which I have in severe form. That doesn't mean people shouldn't take treatment. It just means to be careful. However, if someone does develop tardive dyskanesia then Clozaril doesn't cause it although it has severe side effects of its own. But its an option. There are many new medications in development that are more effective and I could post links the articles are from psychiatric journals and a bit complex. However, the most promising class of medications are the glutamate antagonists. The American Psychiatric Association has identified these as the next class of medication. They don't cause tardive dykinesia or diabetes and they promote a full recovery. They found that in people that are psychotic that glutamate transmission was lacking and that by giving them glycine they recovered. I am on glycine as supervised by my psychiatrist and advocating to have it released as a medication although its in multiple Phase II FDA studies. One of these medications is being researched and should be out in 5 years although I am advocating for it to be sooner.So for a basic summary, the current antipsychotics (from Thorazine to Abilify) work by lowering the level of dopamine. The new medications work by raising the level of glutamate transmission and they are far more effective. There are other chemical models in studies as well. With new technology and research they are figuring out exactly what goes on and how to target psychosis and with the help of science, technology, researchers and advocates such as myself who are working to promote these efforts I hope everyone will experience the full recovery I have.",

            "answer": "This is a good overall link:http://www.nami.org/Template.cfm?Section=By_Illness&Template=/TaggedPage/TaggedPageDisplay.cfm&TPLID=54&ContentID=26414However, the glutamate antagonists are too new to be mentioned there.Here is a link to an article about them:http://www.schizophrenia.com/research/javitt.htmThose are the new class of medications I was talking about. This article describes glycine as an adjunct (addition) anti-psychotic but I am being given it as a primary and when my psychopharmocologist publishes the results I'll post that. In the meantime, here's a glutamate antagonist in study that will be given as a stand alone once released:http://network.nature.com/groups/bpcc/notice/2007/09/05/glutamatergic-drug-for-schizophreniaand a link that updates itself on new medications in development:http://www.psychmeds123.info/",
