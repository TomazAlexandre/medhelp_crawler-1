    "question": "Hello - I've been taking Levoxyl 150 now for little over a month, before that I was on 125, before that it was in increment increases of 12. I continuously feel like I have weak muscles, eye pressure, and leg cramps (especially if I do a cat stretch in bed the wrong way). On this new does, I feel like my heart is pumping louder or that I have trouble breathing -- not sure which it really is? In the past with higher doses, especially once I hit the 100 level, I would occasionally experience rapid heart beats, but once I adjusted to the new level they would go away. I always have neck pain and cracky neck bones and my tendons in my arms and neck are always tight! Tight arm/neck tendon was a problem even before I started any type of treatment and so was the weak muscle in the legs feeling -- something that lead me to believe there was something wrong with me in the first place. My TSH numbers, the last I checked were in the mid 3's -- occasionally it drops to a mid to high 2 (I've felt my best in the low 2's). Another huge bother is that I often feel like my tongue is enlarged making it sore because it is always either pressed up against my teeth or stuck in between them. I find at times it is difficult for me to get my words out or find the right words -- the words issues is often really bad whenever my TSH number increase (when it was up in the 6 to 8 range I felt I couldn't even speak!). And my ankles swell, especially my left one. The ankles and swollen tongue were not a factor before I started medications, but the speach/word issues was. This almost seems to be worse when my tongue feels swollen. There was a short while there when I was on my previous dosage level that my ankles were not swelling. Not sure if this is do to my by body fully adjusting to the 125? I was on that dosages for the longest period of time (maybe 6 months?) compared to any other dose that I've been on. Though, after a while, I found my TSH numbers to rise again. I also have put on 30 to 40 pounds in the last 3 years (some of this I blame on the Hypo, some on lack of exercise and stress eating - I gained 20 in one month when I went off meds and my numbers skyrocketed -- a really bad choice on my part!).My doc went for a larger increase this last time because she felt that maybe since I've had a large weight gain and the fluctuation in my numbers and continued symptoms, that maybe I wasn't absorbing as much as I should be.Any suggestions?",
