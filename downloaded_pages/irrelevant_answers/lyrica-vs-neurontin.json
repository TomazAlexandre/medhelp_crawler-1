            "answer": "I have been taking 75mg of Lyrica 3x a day. I feel alot better. Yes I get tired easily and my eyes are a bit fuzzy, but it really works. If I gain weight that would be fine with me I have lost 30 lbs in the last 2 months, so it would be nice to put some pounds.. You need to give it a try. It will help with your diabetis also. You really need to try it and see if it works. If it doesn't then go back to the neurontin and keep on going.Good Luck and God BlessBarb",

I have an appointment tomorrow with my Rheumy to see if my meds need to be upped some.I do understand how having chronic pain and chronic fatigue can make you have feelings of checking out, been there more than once, but then I think of how badly my family would be hurt and how much I want to be here with them.

            "answer": "Hi Ashlan,You have asked a good question. I am very sorry that your husband is having pain. I think it is often just as tough on those that love us when we are suffering. He is lucky to have your caring, concern and compassion.I too have a very injured psoas muscle, ligament and tendon. Mine was injured in a MVA when it (all) was severed (in the groin area) some years ago. It has effected my back stability and causes me great pain, back pain, hip pain and my SI Joint eventually became effected and I have severe pain there. My lower body no longer works as a unit the way it was intended to work. I have copied the following that explains the psoas muscle:Begin Quote:\"The psoas muscle is a major muscle in the human body, responsible for stabilizing the base of the spine, allowing the spine to flex, and rotating the hips for a free range of movement. When kept limber, the psoas functions smoothly with the other muscles of the body to support an upright posture and a flexible lower spine and hips. When the psoas is strained or contracted, it can lead to limitations in free range of motion and an increase of lower back pain.The start of the psoas muscle is found in the lumbar, or lower spine, where the paired psoas muscles anchor on either side of the spine. The muscles wrap around, into the pelvic area, and attach at the knobby part of the hip with several strong tendons. The psoas muscles are considered to be crucial among the hip flexor muscles. Hip flexors allow people to bend their bodies into their hips and to pull their hips into their bodies, and are an important part of human anatomy.Individuals who experience lower back or hip pain may have contracted psoas muscles which are not providing the support that they need. They should gently stretch to elongate their muscles and make them more flexible, as well as seeking medical attention if the pain continues, grows worse, or changes. Engaging in a regular physical fitness routine which includes stretching such as Pilates or Yoga will help to keep the psoas muscle aligned, strong, and flexible, along with other vital muscles of the body.\"End QuoteAs always, consult with your physician and ask what can be done to help strength it. I would think a good rehab program may help. In my case nothing can be done. Please keep us updated and let us know how you/he are doing. Bless you for being so supportive and caring. Take Care, Tuck",
