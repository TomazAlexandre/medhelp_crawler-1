            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!First get the complete blood count, test for diabetes and thyroid done. Consult a hematologist in your medical college and see if the thalassemic trait is under control. Get your serum iron levels tested. In all probability you could be having anemia. You may need iron supplements. Just, do not start anything without the above mentioned tests. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. Take care!",
