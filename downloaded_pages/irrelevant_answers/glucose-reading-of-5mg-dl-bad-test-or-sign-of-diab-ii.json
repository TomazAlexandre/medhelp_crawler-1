            "answer": "Hi,I a pretty sure that was a mis-reading or mis-print because glucoses below 30mg/dL often cause some degree of mental status changes or loss of consciousness. I cannot imagine you being awake and functional with a glucose of 5mg/dL which would not be sufficient for adequate brain function.The reading does not fit with diabetes either where you would expect a high reading and not a very low one.If you are concerned about possible diabetes given your family history, you should\u00a0\u00a0repeat the fasting and/or have an oral glucose tolerance test to get the information that you need.take care.",

    "question": "Hello,I'm a 29 year old male in relatively good shape (work out a fair amount, but I could lose a five or so pounds), and a recent blood chemistry exam I took as part of my life insurance qualification showed that my glucose levels were 5mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0Is that possible considering that the normal range is 70-125 and according to everything I've read online, levels below 20 can lead to unconsciousness?\u00a0\u00a0All my other readings--cholesterol, tryglyc, blood pressure, etc.--came back normal to optimal.\u00a0\u00a0The test was administered by an RN and after about 9 hours of fasting.I would normally dismiss that as a misreading, but as long as I (and my parents) remember, I have had a persistent thirst and can get pretty irritable if I go hungry for too long or get especially stressed.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be a sign of forthcoming diabetes II?\u00a0\u00a0Should I consult a doctor?\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be greatly appreciated.Thanks.T",
