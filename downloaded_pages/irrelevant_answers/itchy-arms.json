            "answer": "Hello,Are there other symptoms present such as skin rashes? This could also be an irritation, allergic reaction or even skin conditions such as dermatitis or eczema. Prutitus or itching without associated rash may also be due to underlying medical conditions such as anemia or diabetes. If it persists, have this checked for proper management.Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "I just went to a dermatologist this am, after 14 years of my arms itching in the fall.\u00a0\u00a0I used to just blow it off as a change of seasons... but this spring, it happened again.\u00a0\u00a0And now it's Oct and I'm not sleeping.. it's the worst it;s ever been.\u00a0\u00a0I told the dermatologist I didnt' know if I should see her, or an allergist.\u00a0\u00a0After talking with me a while.... both arms, nothing helps, benadryl just makes me sleep, doesn't really help the itch....\u00a0\u00a0she is sending me to a neurologist for a consultation.\u00a0\u00a0She thinks it's a nerve issue... it's not really an itch.. it's a tingling deep in my skin.\u00a0\u00a0After she said that I said, oh, I've had tremors in my hands for a while, but asked my doc and he looked at it and said it wasn't bad enough to do anything about.\u00a0\u00a0 He put a piece of paper on my outstretched hands to see how much I shook.\u00a0\u00a0 I asked why am I not in pain...\u00a0\u00a0she said itching is a \"form of pain\"... the tingling....\u00a0\u00a0and the shaking, oh, and why have my shoulders been bothering me for months?\u00a0\u00a0 is that connected too? Good news: maybe the neurologist will solve the problem/ bad news:\u00a0\u00a0still itching and nothing can be used to help.I'll post again after I see the neuro guy...",

    "question": "I have what people are calling the severe itching on the arms, especially my left forearm.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe we should call it the severe itchy arm syndrome.I have found two things that work.\u00a0\u00a0The first is a spinal correction.\u00a0\u00a0I told my chiropractor about it, and he checked me out for it and said it was related to a pinched nerve and it went away immediately after a correction.It did come back recently.\u00a0\u00a0I will be going again to the chiropractor but I also use the product, Nature's Solution.\u00a0\u00a0http://www.naturessolution.org/\u00a0\u00a0This provides immediate relief when sprayed.\u00a0\u00a0It lasts for awhile and then you mist a little more solution on.\u00a0\u00a0Gradually, my experience is that the itch goes away with repeated sprays and also from being readjusted at a chiropractor.This discussion is related to/posts/show/302536.",
