I wouldn't take another dose untill I was checked by a doctor. Do you have anaphlaxsis with penacillian?",

    "question": "I'm 39 1/2 weeks pregnant with our first child. I had a horrible day yesterday (This is a little rant) i went to see a midwife for a routine app, after last week seeing a specialist diabetes midwife, they said i had suspected diabetes but wanted to see me again when i was 40+4 weeks (which would made me over due, and they generally offer an induction cause of baba being big) they found out that i also had a possible uti.. Well at the midwifes shes test my wee again and still found odd things so she rung for my results which discovered i had an E Coli UTI!!! I am allergic to penicillin and they gave me something else to combact it.. But my doctor rang after taking my first dose, making me aware that there is a high chance of me having an allergic reaction to this too and made me aware of side affects.Anyways back to the point now you know the facts: last night i've had terrible pain in my lady area like period pains and now i've woke up with the sorest throat ever.. Like i have tonsillitus.. I feel like i'm hurting my little girl.. Think she would be safer her with me on the outside.. I feel absolute crap now! My question is anybody else had an e coli uti this far in there pregnancy?",
