            "answer": "I don't know the levels of individual elements. I just know eGFR which mine is 54, so about 45-50% kidney function. I am stage three. I only have one kidney so I got them to test the remaining one to make sure it was still working properly. It wasn't. But at least it was caught early.Most people don't know they have kidney issues until they are stage 4 because it doesn't cause any noticeable symptoms. Most people will also have something like high blood pressure or diabetes. (I have neither).I would just go to my regular doctor and get them to review the results. They will know if you should be seeing a specialist. Mention the swollen ankles.If your creatine is normal, and your results have been consistent for six years, I am no doctor but I would be very surprised if you had anything to worry about. If you do have kidney disease it is progressing very very slowly. Usually in six years you would notice a decline in the numbers if you had something to worry about.",

            "answer": "The US (assuming you are from US as most people on here are) system is so different than the Canadian one. Here you would have to get a referral from your family doctor to see a specialist. Mind you here you don't have to pay either so they are a little more stringent with resources.",

    "question": "I do a USG, and monitor creatine (1.0)\u00a0\u00a0and uric acid level (6.8), BUN (12.0), Urine creatine (250) are\u00a0\u00a0normal. Solubles like calcium (9.4), Phosphorus (4.6), Sodium (142.0), Potassium (4.9) and Chloride (105) are not very far from the normal high limits. These readings are consistent for about 6 years. However, sometimes I do get mild pain in lower right flank (somewhere where the kidneys are) and generally dissappears on its own. Lately, I am having swollen ankles. I am normal BP and no diabetes. Thyroid (TSH: 1.83) is normal, so is routine urine test result.I am aware of Liver conditions; That the liver can continue to function till 80% of it is knocked down, and you may only vaguely suspect anything wrong till it is serious problem. It that so also with Kidneys? Should a specalist opinion be sought? Or the USG and associated blood work is conclusive that there is no problem with the kidneys?Thanks!",
