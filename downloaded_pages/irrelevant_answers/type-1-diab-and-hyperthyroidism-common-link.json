            "answer": "Yes, many people with Type 1 Diabetes have another autoimmune condition such as thyroid. I don't know for sure the answer about pregnancy but I would definitely assume your thyroid should be normal before becoming pregnant as hyperthyroidism affects everything. It's also easier to manage your Diabetes when your thyroid is stable. Do you take medications for thyroid? If you are newly diagnosed it takes awhile to get the thyroid stable sometimes.",
