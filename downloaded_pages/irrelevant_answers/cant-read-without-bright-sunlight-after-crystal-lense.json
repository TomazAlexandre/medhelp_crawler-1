    "question": "Hello, I had Crystalens about a year ago and now, I have alot of problems reading without really bright sunlight.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if anyone else has had a similar experience?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor says my Crystalens has shifted and I need to have YAG\u00a0\u00a0that will be on a different side of the eye than normally performed.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor would like to perform YAG on both eyes, not just the one with the shifted lens.\u00a0\u00a0I don't understand why I can't just have my lens replaced, but my doctor has advised against it.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned because it seems like after the YAG I can't have my lens replaced, whereas before such I can.\u00a0\u00a0I am also really worried that as I am a diabetic I may have more chance for RD after YAG.\u00a0\u00a0I was really happy with my Crystalens initially, but then it didn't seem to return to me my night vision.\u00a0\u00a0Also, can anyone tell me how soon after having Crystalens implanted can the eye be dilated without causing it harm?\u00a0\u00a0Initially I was told it was best to wait at least one month, which my doctor did for one eye.\u00a0\u00a0Then, the technician insisted on dilating my other eye just one week post-op.\u00a0\u00a0Well, any help is really welcome, it's so nice to find such a great wealth of information and nice people sharing it on one board.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks much.",
