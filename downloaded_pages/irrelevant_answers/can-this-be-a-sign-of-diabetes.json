            "answer": "First of all, I understand your concern since you seem to know and be related to people with diabetes and your symptoms do sound suspicious.\u00a0\u00a0From your blood sugar readings, it doesn't sound like you have diabetes, even though I am not a doctor and can't even begin to provide a diagnosis.Could it be possible that you may have had a urinary tract infection that caused you to urinate and perhaps sleep a little more than usual?The only other thing I would check is how you are measuring your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like you are not from the United States and the measurements you may be using may have a different meaning than the ones we're used to.\u00a0\u00a0The numbers you have are quite normal if measuring on a mg/dl scale, but I know that there is another scale that blood sugars can be measured on and blood testing machines sometimes have both options.\u00a0\u00a0Just like your weight sounds really low if I substitute pounds for kilograms, that may be happening with your blood testing machine.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think so, however, since you did get it tested at a clinic.\u00a0\u00a0Just to be on the safe side, it may be time to have a physical.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you.Es",

            "answer": "Thank you es for your reply.For the urinary tract infection, I'm not sure of that as I didn't see a doctor, this symptom disappeared 2 days later. For the sleeping, for me it's not unusual, I oversleep in the weekends :DWell, I check the blood sugar using standard monitoring devices. I'm quite sure we have the same devices as the ones you have in the US, and the scaling system is also the same; mg/dl, and we are not using other units, so when I say 75 for example then it's 75 mg/dl. My weight is 130 lbs, and I know it should be higher.So, you think the readings are normal? Even it climbs to 140 and then gets down to 74, and jumping again to 122 and then 72. Or should I see a doctor?Thanks so much for your understanding and reply.",

            "answer": "Hi again!\u00a0\u00a0I do think you are probably OK, but as always, it never hurts to check out your concerns with a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0As far as your weight goes, I don't know how tall you are so I can't really comment on whether or not you are underweight.\u00a0\u00a0If that is a concern of yours, then I would check that out with the doctor also.\u00a0\u00a0It may just be that you need to have someone help you get on a regular healthy eating schedule.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you.ES",

    "question": "Good day all, what a job you do to help others who are in need of you, so thank you.I know that you are not doctors, but your experience with this disease is very helpful at least to me.OK, here is the story:About 3 months ago, a friend of mine (who is diabetec) bought a new monitoring device, so he just wanted to check it by testing us, I got mine and it was about 72.About 2 months later, I bought my mom another device since she is also diabetec, I measured mine to test it and it was around the same level, about 74. The time of these readings were after lunch, and after eating some crackers. I usually eat them before dinner (chocolates, biscuits, soft drinks, etc). I'm slightly under weight (174 cm, 60 kg).About 4 days ago, I had a very excessive urination, God, it made me sick that day going to the bathroom every 30 mintues. Anyways, I thought of my BS, so I tested it after about 4 hours after dinner and it was about 88. The following day, I tested it about 1 hour after dinner and it was 140! I got scared, I decided testing it after sleeping (fasting). I did and it was 74 (in about 6 hrs). When I came back from work, after my usual crackers, it was 111. I decided to make the test in a clinic (for more accuracy), it was 122. Since it was a weekend over here, I slept that night for more than 13 hrs :DWhen I woke up it was 76 (didn't eat anything yet). I think it's worth mentioning that nothing changed in my life, I'm even very happy this week because something good happened.So what do you think? Should I be worried? I'm 25 years oldThank you.",
