            "answer": "Schedule your MRI today. The worst part is not knowing. Having a diagnosis is such a relief. I thought when my doctor said I could have a pituitary tumor she was crazy. I put it off and put it off. Fast forward three months and I am going back to work after having surgery to get it removed. I only wish I went sooner.",

            "answer": "What does blood testing show?Non-secreting tumors are typically large. A pituitary MRI is called a dynamic MRI and should be ordered by a pituitary endo. Not every place can do it as it requires skill. It is simply a technique that requires the uptake of the contrast to be recorded. But it can be messed up.Have you seen your PCP? Puffy usually mean a fluid imbalance - are you drinking enough?",

            "answer": "I am drinking lots of fluids as another symptom I have is excessive thirst. My blood tests were in the normal range but was told non secreting tumours won't show anything in blood tests. I can't imagine waiting months for a possible diagnosis when I am already so low functioning. I don't know what to do or what else could be wrong.",

            "answer": "The excessive thirst and peeing is called diabetes insipidus caused by ADH being off. It can also be regular diabetes (sugar diabetes).I waited over 12 years for my diagnosis... It is sadly not uncommon to wait years or even decades for a diagnosis.So, you really need to get accurate testing (proper time, good lab, good doctor to interpret) to know what is going on if you suspect endocrine issues.",

I am seeing a neurologist for the first time on Feb 13th. I don't know what tests or questions to ask of him. If it isn't pituitary is there something else that causes similar symptoms?",

            "answer": "I finally saw an expert who knew what he was doing.A neurologist does not diagnose or treat pituitary disorders. You need to see an endocrinologist at first then a neuro-endocrinologist. A neuro-endo will not see you until you have at least some baseline studies that show you have a tumor or good evidence of a tumor.The symptoms are really all over the place - so it can be an auto-immune disorder, other hormones or other things. You really need decent, accurate testing.",

My best hope is for my neurologist to refer me to an endo. I don't know how you did this for 12 years it feels like my lifes falling apart",

I look back at those pics and wonder how I saw a doc just a few months before diagnosis who said I was just fine... fine... I looked... horrific!I know so many of us in same boat- and somehow we do it.",

    "question": "Hi everyone. I am a 22 year old female. I have been unable to work or drive since October due to being so sick. I lose my vision when I turn my head certain ways,low energy, constant headache, I am pale and my face is puffy. I know I need an MRI but have been waiting a while to get one.The last blood test I had a month ago was ok but I do know some tumours don't secrete hormones.I'm afraid the mri might not pick up on the tumour because I have read that you need a special protocol for pituitary. I have read so many stories where the tumour was missed. I am getting more sick and missing out on being young. Do any of you have any advice? Anything is much appreciated, support from those who understand means a lot.",
