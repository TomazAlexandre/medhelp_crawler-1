            "answer": "How old is your father? How is his health otherwise? What caused his kidneys to fail? I assume he is on hemodialysis?I have had two kidney transplants. I didn't do very well on dialysis either time I was on it. I did both hemodialysis and then changed to peritoneal dialysis. I can honestly say, that a transplant was the better option for me, however it isn't necessarily a permanent fix. My first kidney suffered from multiple acute rejection episodes as well as chronic rejection until eventually I had to go back on dialysis.",
