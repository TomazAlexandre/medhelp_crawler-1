            "answer": "Having a high fiber diet/supplement can cause many side effects, including bloating, gas, stomach pain, etc. I wouldn't worry about it, the side effects are fairly normal, even if they are extremely annoying. Hope you can find something that works well for you at your next appointment. Good luck",

    "question": "I'm a 16 year old girl. I have Type 1 Diabetes and my sugars are under control. I was experiencing consipation and stomach cramping so I saw a GI. She told me I'm lactose intolerant so we elimated that from my life. She also put me on a high fibre diet and prescribed me to PEG (polyethylene glycol), a fine powder that you dissolve in water that cleanses the bowel. It's definitely working. The first week I felt stomach sick and had some diarhea, normal stuff. But now im at the end of the second week and I'm still experiencing stomach cramping. Plus after I eat I get extreme upper abdominal bloating after I eat (even if it's a food that isn't supposed to cause bloating or if it's a small amount of food). I'm not as hungry as I used to be. I used to eat 2 starches, a dairy (now that would be lactose free), a fruit or vegetable and a protein. Now all I'm hungry enough for is 2 starches and a fruit. I've never been able to sleep well but another doctor prescribed me to our natural sleeping horomone (melatonin) in pill form and I slept like a baby. But now the pills only help me get to sleep. I can't stay asleep. And when I wake up in the night I can't get back to sleep until an hour or so later. I get headaches and feel stomach sick for short periods of time daily now. My stools are thin, not pencil thin but thinner then they used to be and also short. They sink pretty fast and they're a dark brown (i've always had dark brown stools). I think there's mucus too, it looks like little thin lines of white in the stool. After a bowel movement I have the feeling that I haven't completely emptied my bowel. I'm also extremely gassy. I have a doctor's appointment in December but I'm really worried. Does anyone know what this could be? Am I freaking out over nothing? Thanks",
