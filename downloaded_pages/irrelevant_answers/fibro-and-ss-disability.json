            "answer": "I've heard where people who have fibro are having a tough time getting disability. However, with your other medical conditions... hopefully that should be enough. From what I hear, SS tends to discriminate towards younger people... since you are 60, I would say that you would have a better chance of being approved, than someone who is younger.Remember if SS denies you or is taking too long, that you can call your Senator and/or Congressman and they may be able to help you expedite the process.Good luck !",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reply. Mt anxiety and depression over all my health issues has me flared up bigtime. Can't afford to quit work, and have trouble working. I would love to get up one day and not be in pain, but I don't see that happening anytime soon. The best I have felt for years was when I was off the month for the cervical disc removal and fusion, because I didn't have to do anything. But I barely made it thru this week working. Have you heard anything about an IV of Lidocaine for fibro? The specialist who did my nerve conduction studies mentioned it, but I haven't been able to find out anything about it.",

            "answer": "You would be a shoe in for SSDI but unfortunately you are working. You have to be off work for 5 months before you apply. The fact you are working shows you are able to work (according to the SSA).\u00a0\u00a0 I know several people who would be able to get SSDI but have to work, they too are older, around 60 and have some nasty and serious conditions. Then there are luckier people who have a spouse they can fall back on and be supported while they wait for the slow wheels to turn at the SSA.\u00a0\u00a0As far as getting disability for fibro, with all your problems, fibro would be the least of your worries. They would look at your spine problems, surgeries, diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Are you depressed and on any anti anxiety meds and antidepressents?\u00a0\u00a0yes.?\u00a0\u00a0Ok, good.\u00a0\u00a0 When you do get SSDI, you get medicare within 2 years. And yes, you do have to pay for part B medicare, part A is free.I suggest you look into the Social Security Administration Website and look into their blue book of impairments. SSA.gov.",

            "answer": "That you so much for the input. I just had more lab tests done today, they took 4 vials of blood! CBC, anemia, ANA HLA-B27, etc. Will see doctor on Fri for results. It is so discouraging. I try to plan something for weekend, then have no energy to do anything. I did 2 loads of laundry this weekend, and 1 load is still in dryer. LOL Legs really hurting tonight. And yes, I take anti-depressants, and just renewed perscrip for sleeping pills, because 4-5 hrs a night is not enought rest. Will check out the website, thank you so much.",

I did get ssi/disability just on the fibro case... I live here in N.Y. If you need info on a very, very good lawyer here in NY let me know....That does deal with fibo and disability,, It's her line of work and she is very good at what she does..",

            "answer": "Hello. I just wanted to tell you not to give up, pursue SS disability. I finally got approved after a 2 year wait. Unfortunately, my representative (Of course I had to hire someone) told me that as long as you are working, even while pursuing disability you have a slim chance of getting it.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend that you talk to your local Social Services office, they can help you with things until your disability comes through. It was hard. My sister is still waiting for hers, it has been 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0We are in our 50's and I did hear those 50 and over do get approved sooner than younger people.\u00a0\u00a0It is hard living on one income and then being forced to stop work and having to wait on the disability.\u00a0\u00a0Your best bet would be to stop work if you can, as long as you are working they will consider you able to work. I hope this helps.",
