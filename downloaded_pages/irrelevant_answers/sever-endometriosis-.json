            "answer": "When I first got married I tried to conceive for 3 years. The doctor gave me different meds and they finally said endometriosis is the problem. When I gave up on trying to conceive I got pregnant full term with my daughter. I tried again after 2 and a half years to get pregnant and couldn't. When I stopped trying, I got pregnant and I am almost 15 weeks and my first daughter will be 3 this month. My best advice to u is relax and don't stress bc that does put stress on the baby. Good luck!",

Tru to eat as natural and healthy as possible. Best advice I can give :)",
