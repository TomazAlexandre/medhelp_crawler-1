I had a mri on the brain and neck,negative, i had ct scan of the brain, negative. I had a thyroid test, lupus, diabetes, multiple schlerosis, nerve conduction study, and several types of blood tests, i think one of them was called an a-n-a, a d dimer, and there were some ohers. And as far as my symptons back in August i started having left sided burning in my head, felt like it was right under my scalp, kindof hot maybe itchy w/tingling feelings, pain in my face and a feeling in the back of my throat that would not go away, like someone was holding there hand around the front part of my neck. Then the severe muscle like pain in my arms,legs, & face, and on top of that i went from 134lbs to 118lbs in 2mths. That all lasted for about 3mths, then went away 1 sympton at a time. Everything cam back normal. Now all of the symptoms have started over 1 at a time.",
