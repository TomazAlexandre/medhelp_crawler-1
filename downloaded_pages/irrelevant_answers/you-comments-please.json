            "answer": "First of all, I would suggest a liver ultrasound to evaluate the elevated bilirubin and the liver.\u00a0\u00a0With your history of heavy drinking you certainly are at risk for liver disorders (i.e. cirrhosis, fatty liver etc).Regarding the diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0A rigid sig was negative.\u00a0\u00a0CBC, thyroid, anemia, diabetes, ESR Sedimentation, C reactive protein all negative.\u00a0\u00a0There are various causes for chronic diarrhea in addition to IBS.\u00a0\u00a0They can include inflammatory bowel disease, chronic infection, and malabsorption syndromes.\u00a0\u00a0The question is what is the most reasonable next test.The flexible sigmoidoscopy is a good next step.\u00a0\u00a0Studies show that over 90% of causes of chronic diarrhea are within the range of the flexible sigmoidoscope.\u00a0\u00a0If the diagnosis remains unclear after the flex sig, I would then consider the colonoscopy.If the endoscopy is negative, I would consider tests for malabsorption - which can cause foul smelling stools.\u00a0\u00a0A fecal fat test, test for lactose intolerance and serum tests for celiac disease can all be considered.If all the GI tests are negative, then IBS should be considered and the treatment of this disease optimized.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Thanks,Kevin, M.D.",

            "answer": "I have two thoughts: first, if you haven't already, you MUST stop drinking. Cirrhosis of the liver is an ugly thing to have, and you are a candidate. Second, I wonder what kind of gastroenterologist would still be doing a rigid sigmoidoscopy, especially with your symptoms. I'd suggest full colonoscopy, and would ask around about your gastroenterologist. Or ask him directly whether he's experienced with colonoscopy and why he hadn't recommended it. If his answers make sense to you, well and good!",

For the record, yes my drinking has stopped, I said this in my initial posting.I asked kindly for your thoughts, enlightened ones I had hoped. To be told only that I need colonoscopy and that my doctor is probably inept and that if I believe what he says then all well and good, what use to me is this?",

Until recently I have been a regular beer drinker with a habit of up to 7, yes seven, pints of beer each and every evening, also a smoker however I have cut that down now to almost none. Last November I started to have repeated bouts of diarrhea which I could not\u00a0\u00a0explain. In Jan 2003 I visited my local doctor where upon I was asked to have a series of blood tests.
