            "answer": "Hi mateI was born with only 1 kidney and some yrs ago was diagnosed with Kidney stones and UPJ obstructionafter 2 pyleoplasty operations my body seems to make more scar tissue that causes UPJ obstructions. As a result I have had stents in place for the last 15 yrs at first it was changed every 6 months but now is changed every 4 months.I even had whats called endopyleotomy (I hope thats correct spelling) basically thats a small lazer that is passed up the ureter to where the obstruction is and burns away the scar tissue but sadly my body didnt like that idea either so i am back to having the stent changed every 4 months until such time there is a new treatment or my kidney begins to fail then its dialysis and eventually a transplant. Thats what i got to look forward to .Good Luck anyway and i hope you get better treatment than meAndyman52",
