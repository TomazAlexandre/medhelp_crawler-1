            "answer": "An ECG is appropriate for help to diagnose a heart rhythm disorder.\u00a0\u00a0The EKG can show ischemia (EKG...ST segment elevated or depressed) to the heart, but the sensitivity factor requires further evidence such as an echocardiogram and relevent symptoms.ANT.SEPTAL ISCHEMIA. The Septum is a wall that separates the left and right heart chambers (ant. is the location) and ischemia indicates lack of adequate blood flow to the subject area...usually due to vessel blockage. The significance, if true, is there may be some blockage of blood flow due plaque buildup and/or a blood clot. It usually is not considered serious other than the condition may represent there are other areas that have vessel plaque buldup.You are correct the ECG test relates to heart issues.\u00a0\u00a0Your father may have some calcium buildup in the vascular system, but almost everyone over the age of 40 has some degree of blockage of the vessels.It doesn't seem reasonable for the insurance coverage to discontinued coverage based on the ECG test.\u00a0\u00a0Your father may want to followup on the ECG report to determine if his vascular system has a calification problem and high cholesterol level. That condition can/will cause high blood pressure and should be treated.Hope this helps, and if you have any further questions you are welcome to followup.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for sharing and take care.",

            "answer": "Thank You Sir for the valuable suggestion.Can you also suggest what test should be done to follow up on this.These are my understandings and Queries from your reply.1.Cholestrol need to be checked and controlled.2.Calification problem-what test are normally done to determine this.?3.ECHO is required to get to know problems better.He is diabetic and is\u00a0\u00a0using a tablet for BP along with diabetes.Thanks and RegardsVRR",

            "answer": "Q:1,2.Cholestrol need to be checked and controlled. Calification.>>>>>Blood test to evaluate lipid levels.\u00a0\u00a0There is medication to lower cholesterol, etc.\u00a0\u00a0The medication will stop or slow progression of plaque formation (calcification)..Q: 3.ECHO is required to get to know problems better.An echo is ultrasound that provides an image of the heart movement as well as blood flow through the heart.\u00a0\u00a0If the septum is ischemic the echo will show whether there is reduced septum wall impairment.\u00a0\u00a0Often when there is a lack of blood flow to a heart area the heart cells may become dysfunctional and wall movement is reduced and may effect the pumping phase.\u00a0\u00a0The echo will also calculate in percentage how much blood is pumped into circulation with each heartbeat,...If the heart is pumping a normal percentage (efection fraction 55 to 75%), your father's heart is not an issue regarding septum ischemia.If you have any further questions, you are welcome to ask.",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,Last week My parents had gone through a series of tests prescribed by an health insurance firm.It included ECG also and the result says that my fathers(64yrs)cannot be insured as his ECG report shows ANT.SEPTAL ISCHEMIA.The other fact is that My father met with an accident in april2009 with a head injury and was hospitalized for a week. He has recovered and is normal and even is going to work.Will the head injury or a small fracture on the skull just above the forehead then have an inpact on the ECG.? ECG normally would show heart related problems right?Request you to let me know if this is some serious concern? What should I be doing now to normalize this problem.",
