    "question": "every once in a while I seem to get an outbreak of these blister-like formations on the right butt cheek, & always in the same place.\u00a0\u00a0I really do not notice if it is due to diet, or an over abundance of stress, or whatever is the case here; but when it happens the only thing that works for me to clear it up, is a bath powder with baking soda in it, or a baby powder.\u00a0\u00a0That seems to dry it up further and quicker.\u00a0\u00a0Or, you could also use a Gold Bond Powder that has a drying agent.\u00a0\u00a0Mine has a tendency to itch, only when it is about to clear itself up, and tender to the touch when it first appears.\u00a0\u00a0I have found that if you keep the area clean, and where clean underwear everyday(some folks do not), that this helps a lot. I have had this condition for a few years now, and do not know where or who I got it from, and will probably never to figure this one out!This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/241277\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/241277</a>.",
