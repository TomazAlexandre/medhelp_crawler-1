            "answer": "my brother was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes when he was 12, smoked weed from age 13 to to age 29, started doing harder drugs at about age 18 and drank daily then started doing heroine at about age 27. he is insulin dependent (2 shots a day) and ate right and stayed fit. he started to lose his teeth at age 25 and his feet started getting spots on the bottom around that same time. now he is 32 and no longer drinks or does drugs and his health is better. for him, all that junk he did, did not affect his health too dramatically but if he had not stopped partying, we may have lost him. i commend you for reaching for help. try going to a counselor to talk about why you drink and smoke, maybe there are some underlying issues that need to be resolved. you, as a diabetic, want to do everything in your power to live a long and healthy life. you deserve it like everyone else. i realize it can be somewhat traumatic to live with this illness but you can live a long and wise life and be diabetic. lots of luck to you",

            "answer": "Hello Livabetes,GREAT screen name!\u00a0\u00a0:-)\u00a0\u00a0As you know, we're all volunteers here.\u00a0\u00a0The advice you've received from the comments below say more & better than anything I could offer you.It is heartening to hear your interest to overcome substance abuse.\u00a0\u00a0The little I do know is that a personal, internally-motivated decision to make difficult changes is REQUIRED to beat the abuse.An abused mind is clouded & plays tricks on the person.\u00a0\u00a0The trick is that the abuser is \"better off\" or \"can't function\" without their drug of choice.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that that's always a lie.\u00a0\u00a0Drug users eventually end up on one of two paths -- the path you're attempting to take and the path that leads to a premature end.It seems that one very hard part of getting & STAYING sober involve separating from other users who pretend to be friends.\u00a0\u00a0They are not friends, they are equally scared & dependent & feel safer with folks who won't challenge their choices.\u00a0\u00a0They will not help you get & stay clean unless they are committed to the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0AA and NA are *FABulous* organizations to help users develop a strong network of folks who've been there & done what you're doing, who are still tempted and fight their demons, and who day-by-day, decision-by-decision they are winning.Many abusers self-medicate to avoid facing personal demons -- tough childhoods, diagnosis of a serious disease like DM, surviving parents' chaos and/or lack of involvement, etc.FInd a support system to help you discover your own courage, your own grace under fire.\u00a0\u00a0It may be scary soemtimes, but you also create the chance to really blossom & to become the person you want to be.Good luck ... please do commit to your long-term health.\u00a0\u00a0It's clear you're very bright (few could function at all with a pint of alcohol dulling their senses each night) -- let that SHINE!",

I am also a dedicated student but unlike you I do not take good care of my diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I think its awesome that you are able to manage your diabetes despite your addiction.\u00a0\u00a0You might try an AA or NA meeting.\u00a0\u00a0I joined an Annorexics and Bulimic support group that has helped me but I also need suport in managing my diabetes because I get discouraged so easily with it and just give up.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with diabetes in 7th grade. When I became a freshman in high school I started using marijuana anywhere from one to more than 10 times a day (I DO NOT smoke cigerettes). When a became a junior I began drinking alchohol a lot. I know that I am phycologicaly addicted to marijuana still, and am also an alchoholic (drinking maybe a pint or so every night). However, I do test 4 times a day and am on an insulin pump, I do a fairely good job of controling my levels, and I work very hard In college (currently a sophmore). Eventhough I have this problem I still have a lot of motivation (except not wanting to exercise) and a drive to be successful. But my problem is, I want to live a long life, with little or no complications with my diabets, as well as to one day overcome my substance abuse problem.My main question is what are the chances of a person in a similar situation as me to grow up with little or no complications with diabetes.i need help!!!p.s. I am currently 19 yrs old and have been living w/ diabetes for about 5 yrs now.",
