    "question": "Hi, I couldn't find the right forum for my questions but basically I went to my docs on friday as I had acid reflux (I get the attacks every fortnight) and I couldn't breath and was crying in pain. They sent me to hospital to be seen by the gp support unit and had bloods taken. Everything came back clear except my liver count is high. I been sent back to my gp and he is sending me for a ultra sound scan. I do not drink (my last drink was over a year ago) and I don't use drugs. I'm not on any medications but do suffer with migraines where I'm left paralysed temp in my left side and face drops and speech slurs and eye sights goes. Do u have any ideas what it can be as I am worried as I'm a young mum of 3 children who depends on me.Thank you, sj",
