    "question": "So my new baby boy is only 4 days old, but on day 2 when i got home from hospital i ate quite a few chocolate easter eggs. I had gestational diabetes, so i was desperately craving to eat some! Then last night, i noticed he was very unsettled, and seemed to have trouble bringing up wind after a feed, crying like he had a pain in the tummy, and was pooing constantly ( i changed his nappy about 6 times in 5 hours!) He has been very settled today, and was just wondering if eating too much chocolate could have affected him? I won't be doing that again!",
