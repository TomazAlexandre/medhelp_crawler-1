            "answer": "I cant say whether or not pesticides are the problem but continued episodes of your dogs vomiting and diarrhea can lead to Pancreatitis which can lead to Diabetes and daily insulin injections.Now is the time to take preventative pet health steps to try to avoid this.My recommendation would be to have your vet run a set of complete blood and urine tests. Then unless the lab tests pinpoint a specific canine health problem, consider a bland home made diet, digestive enzymes and probiotics.Small multiple daily meals with digestive enzymes added to each, a balanced pet vitamin mineral supplement and probiotics should be very helpful to prevent recurrences and avoid Pancreatitis and Diabetes.Be sure your dog's food and treats are not on the FDA Pet Food recall List and remember fresh vegetables and lots of love are very healthy pet treats.If you'd like to discuss this further, please contact our veterinary office and I am glad to help specifically and review your dogs labs, etc.Dr Carol Osborne, DVM",

    "question": "Hello, we trying to help our dog Pete get over his recurring illness and get to the bottom of what is causing it. He is a 6 year old 12lb chihuahua mix that has random recurring episodes where he will get ill several times a year over the last few years. When sick, Pete will become lethargic and have symptoms including vomiting, diarrhea and loss of appetite. This usually will last up to a week and in some cases leads to severe dehydration and require iv fluids from our local vet. He is now experiencing another episode and it's killing us to see him like this and we feel helpless not to be able to help him once again. He has been to different vets and specialist and undergone all kinds of tests, all with negative results. Our theory is that it could be pesticide poisoning from our neighborhood lawn maintenance. When we researched canine poisoning types and symptoms, arsenic poisoning seems to match his symptoms. If anyone has experienced pesticide poisoning or may know what else could be causing his episodes please let us know. Any help will be greatly appreciated.",
