            "answer": "Hi, and welcome to the MS Forum.\u00a0\u00a0We haven't heard from you before.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you post again and tell us a little about why you had an MRI done and why you landed on and MS forum.In plain language the report says:\u00a0\u00a0There are multiple spots of an increased signal.\u00a0\u00a0this translates to multiple spots of lesions.\u00a0\u00a0They show up as bright white spots.\u00a0\u00a0These were picked up using something called the FLAIR technique which is just one of several techniques they use during the MRI to pick up abnormal spots.The radiologist is saying that these spots are not real specific as to what caused them.\u00a0\u00a0It might have been tiny blood vessel disease (microvascular) like you would see in hypertension, migraines, or something like diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But, then (s)he says that the spots could also be from a disease process that attacks and destroys the myelin that wraps the nerve fibers (demyelination).\u00a0\u00a0The most common disease that causes this is Mulitple Sclerosis, but there are also many more diseases in which it is seen.\u00a0\u00a0So the neurologist should do the work up for the other diseases which can cause demyelination.I will say that the lesions of \"microvascular\" disease do not usually cause neurological symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0If you are having symptoms of nerve disease then these lesions can't be ignored.I hope this helps and that you will tell us more about yourself.Quix",

            "answer": "The MRI was done because I had migraine level headaches for over a week (which is not something I suffer from...only had about 3 in my whole life before).\u00a0\u00a0Nothing would make them any better.\u00a0\u00a0I tried migraine medication and sinus headache medication.\u00a0\u00a0Pain was in the front of my head and behind my eyes.\u00a0\u00a0My blood pressure was high as well - around 160/102 while usually about 120/80, so I now have blood pressure medication I take...I am 49 years old and other than some osteoarthritis and sluggish thyroid, I have always been healthy.",
