            "answer": "Sounds really complicated. This thing with the hot showers and tired from walking could be POTS, google it. But you can get POTS from being bed ridden too long so it is not sure that that is your original problem. You also get it from anemia, which could be caused by your old b12 deficiency.I still think you should check it up. It is a form of orthostatic intolerance, meaning that the body has a hard time adapting to upright position and maintaining blood pressure.The test to take is a tilt-table-test. If you have orthostatic problems they will see a drop in your blood pressure when they tilt you up, or as in POTS a big increase in your heart rate.You can also test yourself right away. Take your pulse and blood pressure sitting down and then again standing up. If the blood pressure has dropped more than 20 or the pulse risen more than 30 you clearly have an orthostatical problem.You can also visit the Dysautonomia forum here on medhelp.Good luck!",

    "question": "I'm not sure how this site works, I just signed up a few minutes ago..Hello, My names Caitriona and I'm 19 years old.Last year in July/ August I was having a lot of stomach pains. Eventually they finally did surgery and it turns out I had appendicitis, adhesion's and severe scaring in my appendix.Skipping a few months to October I started to become dizzy all the time. For two weeks I was dizzy, feeling faint and weak. I went to the doctor and she checked for diabetes but they assumed it was that I was still weak for the surgery. One Sunday I started experiencing tingling, numbness and pain in my feet and legs. By Wednesday I couldn't walk. My legs wouldn't hold me up, I felt like the room was spinning, my eyesight went when I stood up, my memory was shot, I was confused all the time, I couldn't get my sentences out, nauseous, my legs felt like I was wearing tight stockings and the pain was burning/ stinging/ throbbing. Within a day or two it spread to my arms and hands. I was in hospital for a week and a half. The doctors didn't talk to me much, only to ask me to repeat my story so I'm sorry I can't be so specific about what they looked for. I must have told this story over 10 times easily now. I'm afraid you don't get to hear the detailed version because I can't really remember too well. Anyway, they eventually told me it was Peripheral Neuropathy caused by B12 Deficiency and sent me home. My neurologist doesn't believe thats what it is.It's now nearly June and I'm still not better. I'm B12 is fine. I had three Kidney Infections since then. I can walk at least but I get tired very easily and experience a lot of pain after. I'm constantly tired. The pain is still on both sides of my body but the right side is a lot worse. I don't have much of an appetite anymore and I really struggle to have conversations with people (I know what they're saying but I don't understand the sentence if that makes sense, sometimes it feels like I've listened to everything they said but as soon as its my turn to response, it's like I've not been listening at all or I've forgotten). Everytime I take a shower I go very weak and feel like I'm going to faint.Can anyone shed any light on whats going on?List of procedures I've had done:2 MRI on brain, 1 on spine, Spinal Tap, Chest Xray, diabetes (3 times), coeliac, b12 injections every week for a month and then once every month for 3 months, the electro shocks in my legs (sorry I've forgotten the name), I had bloods done yesterday and they're checking for inflammation, arthritis, infection, blood sugar, vitamin and mineral levels, and a few other things but I won't know until next week how they went.",
