            "answer": "Your fasting blood sugar when pregnant is suppose to be 20 pts lower then when your not pregnant. My fasting sugar was the same way between 90 - 96 I now take a low dose of meds and my fasting blood sugar is between 70-80. It's not a big deal to take the meds and it's in your baby's best interest.",

    "question": "What r the dangers of my fasting blood sugar being 96-100 daily am 34 weeks pregnant. My post meal numbers have been from 90-120 and 120 when I eat French fries and ice cream. The reason for my question is that I dont feel comfortable taking medications if there is no need but the docs tend to push meds. I am a medical assistant and to my knowledge blood sugars over 100 when fasting tend to be problematic but 100 or less is fine. I am having a csection anyways because my last one was a csection and not related to gd and I am alsi having biophysical u/l starting at 36 weeks. Opinions?",
