    "question": "This morning when I put in my contacts, I noted that my right contact was bugging me-uncomfortable, slightly cloudy. I rinsed it, still wasn't great,\u00a0\u00a0went to work. As I got into my shift\u00a0\u00a0it was so annoying I put in a new one (current one only about 10 days old). The discomfort was better, but I noticed my vision was blurry. I was able to run by my house where I took them both out and put on my glasses. I then could see it was my eye, not the contact that was the problem. I called the eye doctor and made an appt for Friday, but I didn't really get an answer on if I should stop taking the newest meds I'm on. I've been on Pazeo for a couple of weeks, and recently started Dymista. Initially I figured it was the eye drops, but realize it could be the other as well. At this point, I'm going to stop them both, though they were helping with allergies. The blurriness is slightly improved from when it started, but still there. I don't get migraines, so don't think it's an ocular migraine. I don't feel pressure in my eye. I don't have high blood pressure or diabetes, am near sighted and just recently had a \"clear\" eye exam. Just a fluke, or the new meds?Thanks",
