            "answer": "I was on triple med treatment with Incivek and my throat was parched all of the time. I drank water all of the time and 5 seconds after drinking water, I was parched again. It got better (less parched) after I finished the Incivek, but my throat was still fairly dry until after I completely finished treatment.Hang in their. It is not permanent. Just drink lots of water.BTW, While on treatment, I spent a great deal of my time in the bathroom too, LOL.",

            "answer": "The parched feeling is completely normal for tx. I drank more than a gallon of water a day and I had to have water with me every minute of the day. I bought some small flasks (usually for alcoholic drinks) so I could carry water in my smallish purse if I went out, and I used them constantly. Everyone probably thought I was an alcoholic! I had to use the bathroom constantly, even getting up at least once an hour during the night. I tried to cut back on the water at night, but wasn't very successful. I didn't sleep well on tx anyway so I'm not sure if the frequent urination made any difference.Do keep giving your body massive amounts of water, as it really helps keep the side effects somewhat lessened. The dry feeling in the mouth and throat can also be alleviated somewhat by using Biotene mouthwash and chewing gum (both found near the toothpaste in big drugstores). These provide natural enzymes that would normally be provided with saliva, and that can help prevent mouth sores and tooth decay, which are both common with dry mouth. They really do help. Good luck!",

            "answer": "Yes, a gallon of water or 4 litres a day to help flush the meds through your system.I found that keeping a few litres (or a jug, made it easier to see how much water I was drinking) chilled in the fridge tended to soothe my dry mouth and throat better than room temperature. I had a cool bag in the car, and kept cool water in it wherever I went.I never slept really well on treatment, so getting up during the night was no problem, except for the mosquitoes lurking in the toilet!Incidentally, depending on where you live and how your tap water is, when you are drinking that much water it may be best to drink as much filtered.Good luck with TX.",

    "question": "I have a question for all going through treatment. Is one of your side effects feeling extremely thirsty and dry all the time? I was aware of taking\u00a0\u00a0lots of fluids and has been taking it but since I started Victrellis my throat is so dry that I feel like if I dont take water right away something will happen. And its getting more and more. I am constantly having fluids and of course having frequent trips to washroom (it feels like I am there more than any other place lol). I was expecting dehydration but not to this extent. What I mean is no matter how much I drink my throat is always asking for more. Does anyone have the same issue? please share.",
