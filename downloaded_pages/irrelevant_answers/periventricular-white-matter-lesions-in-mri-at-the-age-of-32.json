            "answer": "first I would say relax...... I have had white matter lesions for years...I have seen the BEST drs ( PENN, Jefferson, Hopkins ) and NO ONE has provided a MS DX....they just don't know ( I have LOTS of spots they are NOT in classic MS location ) I have seen maybe 12 neuro's in a decade all say same thing can't make MS dx..... I was consumed for years with these damn spots ( oh and I get more spots over the years ) they do not enhance ..my spinal clear neck and spine mris clear too.... so much they don't know about the brain..... even if they are suspicious its MS as far as I'm concerned MS is a useless diagnosis ... your not going to start on meds that make you sick when you don't feel sick now ( I had top MS DR tell me after he told me I didn't have MS that the meds are pretty much a bad idea to take ) and my dr said even if we gave you the diagnosis of MS drugs would not be the right approach ..... again it depends on the person butA- you may not get any answers and it maybe a watch and wait ( like for me going on 10 years )B- they say we feel its MS but you still live your life and looked towards alternative medicine ( like me.... I feel diet / LDN low dose naltroxene/ piracetam / bone broth etc is keeping me stable ) NO MEDSsometimes we want a diagnosis so bad and really what does a diagnosis even mean for me nothing I stopped going down that rabbit hole ....I realized no matter what words they said I was going to address this with my own researchyou will be just fine ...... some people have one attack and then nothing for decades !",
