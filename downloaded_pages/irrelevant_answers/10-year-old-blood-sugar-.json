            "answer": "Hello, Terri.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You are correct that thyroid disease and diabetes have a higher correlation than they should.\u00a0\u00a0The reason is that both are autoimmune diseases.\u00a0\u00a0However, that doesn't mean that just because you have one that you will get the other.\u00a0\u00a0It is good that you are prudent in checking, but 101 is a normal value for both kids and adults.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think that is indicating diabetes at all.\u00a0\u00a0Normal ranges in a healthy body are from 80 to 120, but remember that even in a normally healthy body, blood sugars can temporarily rise much higher than that.\u00a0\u00a0Think of drinking a Red Bull or eating a bunch of candy in a hurry, and you can easily remember having a 'sugar high' yourself.\u00a0\u00a0It's the sustained highs, as well as exceptionally high numbers (over 250), that indicate problems.\u00a0\u00a0At this time, I don't think you have anything to worry about.",
