            "answer": "It is still possible that the yeast infection has not cleared up. It is important that both partners are treated at the same time and that you abstain from intercourse untill the infection is cleared up.You must retract the foreskin and cover the entire surface of the penis, then replace the foreskin and once again cover the whole surface of the penis and even some of the scrotum.It can at times take a very long time to get rid of yeast. Wash your penis daily and and retract the foreskin while urinating. Try to keep the foreskin and glans as dry as you can.Yeast can also be caused by the use of antibiotics. It can also be the result of certain conditions like diabetes, so you might want to get it checked. Only by seeing a doctor can this be diagnosed properly.All the best.Ron",

    "question": "So.. its been about 1-2 months.. i went to see a urologist about a month ago and he said it looked like a simple yeast rash. so he gave me some cream and it really cleared it up, made my penis look a bit pale but it did help. everytime i masterbate or have sex it gets red again. now, i havnt had sex in 3 days and it there still seems to be a rash there. its not as bad as before, def not as defined and not as red, but its still there. i havnt used the cream either is about 2-3 days.is it a simple friction irritation? or is it something more? will i have to use the cream forever?its really weird, the opening pee hole is a bit pink. then around the tip its white, and then further down the penis head it gets pink again! ARGGG! its making me so mad and sad.this is really stressing me out and its making me really sad. the rash doesnt itch or burn, and im not having discharge.. its just unsightly and making my girlfriend think twice about having sex with me. please any answers will help. thanks.",
