    "question": "Hello, I am a 20 year old female and for nearly five years now I hve been experiencing vacant moments, I have been in and out of the doctors constantly for these 5 years but all I have had done is a.few.blood.tests for diabetes, anemia etc. During these vacant moments I just space out and stare I am completely unaware anything is happening until afterwards, but people have witnessed these and I am unable to talk or move I can't hear them talking and I just don't acknowledge anything around me, I get a fluttery feeling in my stomach and a dizzy feeling, my vision goes blurry and my eyelids twitch. Before these happen I have really hot sweats palpitations and my heart races. They generally only last for a few seconds to a minute but I have had one episode that lasted 1 hour and ten minutes when someone found me and nudged me I cam back to. After these episodes I feel very confused I have.no.memory of wht has happened and I get quite confused and upset. I also feel extremely tired, shaky and my body feels weak\u00a0\u00a0and very thirsty. Could you offer.me any advice thankyou",
