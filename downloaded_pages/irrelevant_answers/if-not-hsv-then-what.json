    "question": "Two questions actually. First off, I had some itch, cuts, and thickening of the vulva which started 2 weeks after unprotected sex with a new person so I had the HSV-2 type specific antibody test at 7 weeks, 13 1/2 weeks 22 1/2 weeks and 29 1/2 weeks all of which came back negative, results were respectively .08, .06, .03 and .04. All of these are obviously negative.So at 22 1/2 and 29 1/2 weeks I had my doctor order the HSV-1 also. Those results were respectively, ,04 and .31, again, obviously negative. I am 49 years old, rarely get colds or the flu because I'm not exposed to being in public often and rarely ever get sick when someone else in the household is. I also have no illnesses of any kind like diabetes or anything else but I am a life long smoker (no lectures please) and drink at least 2 alcoholic beverages a day.My second concern is that over the past 25+ years I have had what I thought were a single fever blister on my chin approximately every three years and expected to at least test positive for type 1 and two tests have come up negative.So the questions are:1. Should I continue to test for both Type 1 and 2, if so how long?2. If my fever blister isn't HSV what could it be or are the results wrong?This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/248831\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/248831</a>.",
