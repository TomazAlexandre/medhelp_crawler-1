            "answer": "Hi!The commonest cause of such symptoms is anemia. Other possibilities are low functioning thyroid, chronic inflammatory disease like rheumatoid, Crohn\u2019s etc, diabetes, or polycystic ovaries. Very low and very high blood pressure is another possibility. You need a detailed investigation to rule out these possibilities. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
