    "question": "~sigh~ ok. so here we go. im 9 weeks along. have had two health ultra sounds, even heard our little beans heartbeat at 8 weeks via abdominal u/s. everything was good other than about of spotting and low hcg very early on which is now good. I just found out however that I am diabetic. since it is so early, they believe it was mild and pre existing and pregnancy made it explode. My levels after drinking the glucose syrum during the test were crazy high....392 one hour later. I am freaking out. all i read is how since i was untreated and undiagnosed during these 8 weeks my baby is likely to have all kinds of defects. Im terrified. anyone had similar experience and have a healthy birth??",
