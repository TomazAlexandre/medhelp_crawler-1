            "answer": "You seem to having unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis which is the paralysis of one side of the diaphragm. This condition is usually well tolerated and most patients are asymptomatic if there is no underlying lung or chest disease.The causes of unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis can be\u2022\tTumor nerve compression (approximately 30% of patients) o\u2022\tLesions adjacent to a phrenic nerve (eg, pneumonia, pleurisy, aortic aneurysm, substernal goiter, neoplasms)\u2022\t Natural or surgical trauma, herpes zoster, and cervical spondylosis\u2022\tTrauma (common and may result from thoracic surgery, manipulation of cervical spine, central venous catheterization, open heart surgery)\u2022\tHerpes zoster, infection, vasculitis, and diabetes mellitus (may be caused by peripheral neuropathy of phrenic nerve)\u2022\tIdiopathicAs mentioned, one sided paralysis is usually well tolerated with symptoms occurring in case of underlying disease or exercise.Treatment is directed towards treating the cause and providing supportive ventilatory care in case of symptomatic patients.Do write in if you need more information.Regards.",

            "answer": "Hi,Unilateral diaphragmatic paralysis is often discovered incidentally in patients undergoing chest radiography for some other reason. Patients usually are asymptomatic at rest but experience dyspnea on exertion and have a decrease in exercise performance. This may result from an acquired dysfunction of the phrenic nerve.The progression of dyspnea is caused by a decline in lung volumes, i.e. vital capacity (VC) and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1). Fo patients\u00a0\u00a0who are asymptomatic,\u00a0\u00a0they do not require treatment. Diaphragm plication in patients with dyspnea that is disproportionate to the degree of physical activity or severity of lung disease may be done.Depending on the etiology of the diaphragmatic paralysis, the outcome\u00a0\u00a0of unilateral disease usually is good unless the patient has significant underlying pulmonary disease.This link may be helpful: http://www.emedicine.com/Med/topic554.htmTake care and regards.",

    "question": "Thru various diagnostic tests,\u00a0\u00a0I have come to find that my RH lung is not working due to the diaphram being paralyzed.\u00a0\u00a0Can't seem to get a diagnosis on this condition, or the treatment of it.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone give a possible cause and cure for this condition?",
