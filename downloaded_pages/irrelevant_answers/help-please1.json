            "answer": "This is Beffy and I forgot to add something to this. I have also been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism and I have diabetes. I was wondering if the thyroidism and diabetes could contribute to the discharge. All I read about discharge is if it is white or clear and doesn't smell it is nothing to worry about. I hope I hear from someone soon. I have a tendency to worry about things and with all I have been going through health wise I am so sick of being sick and tired. Thank you so much for your help.",

    "question": "I have not had a period in about a year and a half. This month I had a heavy discharge, after having hardly any discharge. I used to have normally heavy discharge pre menopause. I also broke out with two zits on my face. The same symptoms when I ovulated in the past or had my period. The discharge is white/clear with no smell. Is it possible to ovulate after menopause or can anyone tell me if they had this before and what could cause it. Thank you for your help.Beffy",
