            "answer": "OK, Thanks :) !What is the difference between the two forums ??I thought the weight loss alternative was for people considering or have had by-pass and things like that.This isogenics system is supposed to be a \"natural\" cleansing approach to dieting , but I don't know :) !I just wanted to throw it out there and see if anyone has tried this diet.I will try the other forum and see if I get any more info there.Thanks....have a blessed day!",

            "answer": "I think the question you ask about how one defines \"natural\" points out that this is a gray zone!\u00a0\u00a0I don't know about Isogenics, but some forms of fasting/detoxing can be done with natural products.However, I do know that I've never met a cow that \"naturally\" produces FF dairy.I'm getting confused as to why this forum seems to be taking the stance of \"my diet is better than yours\" lately.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of turning people away, why not get discussions going about good and safe ways to achieve weight loss?I'm not trying to pick a fight.\u00a0\u00a0The top of the forum reads:\"This patient support community is for discussions relating to dieting, alcohol and dieting, balanced menus, diabetes, success stories, exercise, metabolism, healthy dieting, healthy snacks, holiday tips, and nutrition. Also covered are discussions relating to specific diet plans like the South Beach Diet, Atkins Diet, Slim-Fast, Weight Watchers, Counting Calories, Fat Flush, Body for Life and others.\"\"Fat Flush\" is a detox diet, much like a fasting regime.\u00a0\u00a0\"Slim-Fast\" is not a natural product.\u00a0\u00a0I am getting confused by the terse dismissals being offered to people who have come here for support.I'm not interesting in picking a fight, I am only expressing my concerns about what I consider to be hostile responses appearing here.Regardless of your chosen diet, I hope you all have a good weekend.~W",

What works for one, may not work for another.I was told to refer to the Weight Loss Alternative Forum when supplements, or anything of the kind were in question.Maybe both of these forums should be merged.Good point about the FF dairy.",

    "question": "I've recently had a friend try to get me to do this 9 day fast with supplements by isogenics (not sure of the spelling). Then after that your supposed to take some supplements and continue some of their meal replacements.The \"reason\" this works is because its supposed to cleanse the toxins and give maximum weightloss while becoming healthier?!?So I wanted to know if anyone has heard of or tried this system .Thanks.",
