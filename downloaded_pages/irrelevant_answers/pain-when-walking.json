            "answer": "Hello,Sudden leg pain that show up during physical activity, such as walking, are usually a sign of arterial insufficiency(peripheral artery disease). That means the arteries aren't able to supply the calf muscles with enough blood and oxygen to meet their needs. This usually arises from atherosclerosis\u2014hardening of the arteries. Atherosclerosis can occur for many reasons such as smoking, diabetes, and high cholesterolThe pain from PAD is brought on by exercise, and relieved by rest. The limping that occurs from the leg pain is called claudication.I strongly advise you an evaluation by a physician. Intermittent claudication is a relatively benign and manageable condition, but people with more advanced arterial insufficiency can experience rest pain also.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

            "answer": "I have had the same symptoms for about months, and finally last week have a diagnosis, after much testing, of intermittent claudication - in my case moderate to severe in both legs.\u00a0\u00a0I will be seeing a vascular in 2 days to find out my options. I have already been placed on a medicine called pletal that will hopefully increase my walking distance in the near future.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, I have no diabetes, but have had surgeries on both arteries in my neck to remove blockage approximately 6 years ago, but didn't take my doctor's advice to quit smoking til some time later.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you will see a doctor as soon as possible about your symptoms - yours might be able to be helped.\u00a0\u00a0Keep me posted and good luck....

    "question": "I develop muscle pain in my upper thighs after walking more than 50 steps.\u00a0\u00a0If I persist, I develop pain in both joints where my upper leg fits into my hip.\u00a0\u00a0If I force myself to continue the pain becomes intense/unbearable, so I have to rest.\u00a0\u00a0The pain stops immediately, but resumes when I repeat this cycle. I have lived with this situation (and do not walk much) for over 10 years.I have type 2 diabetes for over 20 years, controlled by medication and diet. Sugars are approx. 118; a1c about 6.2.BP 120/60.\u00a0\u00a0Age 65.Have taken all sorts of tests but doctors are clueless, although one doctor told me the thigh pain was due to the small capillaries being starved for oxygen due to sugar in my blood.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if that wouldn't have resolved itself after being in \"sugar control\" for so long?\u00a0\u00a0And then, what about the joint pain?",
