            "answer": "Sorry to take so long to get back to you. I only gained 30lbs. And I ignored my cravings for the most part because I craved fruit. If i really wanted my craving (watermelon) I would eat 30g of carbs worth and then have like a hamburger with out the bun but all the veggies and lots of water for a meal. On tje gonwas the nature valley bars. There was one kind within my carb limit. And I did the eliptical for an hour everyother day and I would walk a few times a week too. I'm really hoping I don't have it again but if I do its no big deal. I've done it once and it really isn't too difficult. Just gotta keep thinking that your doing this for you baby so it doesn't get stuck in the birth canal and die or you get an emergency c-section. I was very determined to succeed with it. I did so well I didn't need to go to the high risk clinic in the hospital, just went to see my normal midwives. I knew a girl that had her baby 2 weeks after me with an emergency c-section and her baby was almost 11lbs. She was also GD and I saw her FB posts about eating at the state fair and eating all sorts of crap. Lets just say I was very thankful I kicked my *** on being strict.",
