            "answer": "I agree... they usually only test your beta levels if a miscarraige is in question. They also usually stop testing them all together once the babies heart beat has been seen in an u/s, because from that point onward if there are any questions an u/s is much more reliable.As far as your urine, I do give a sample at every visit, but I know that a lot of Dr's only test urine in the later stages of pregnancy. Most are testing for sugar (indicating diabetes, which you already have) and protein (indicating possible pre-elampsia).Like annaleesmom said, if you are worried about them not doing something ask them.Best of Luck to you!",

            "answer": "i wasnt hearing anything about them either so i asked my doctor and she said that she felt it didnt need to be done because everything looked and appeared to be fine and i dont have a history of miscarriages...so that she only usually checks if theres a cause for concern and like niki_beth said u/s are a more reliable checker to see if baby is doing well. so hang in there, your doing just fine!",

            "answer": "My doctor has never mentioned my levels, even though I have miscarried before. I know in fact that they were taken, as I read them on the lab slip, but the results were never mentioned to my. I take that as a good sign. :) And the other ladies are right, an u/s is far more reliable on telling how a baby is progressing.",

            "answer": "Levels of what? HCG? That's a blood test and is usually done in early first trimester. There's no need for you to get those tests done.And they do need to watch your diabetes VERY carefully during pregnancy. So it isn't that that is their main focus. It is that they focus on that to ensure your baby is healthy and thriving.",

    "question": "is it strange that my doctors dont say anything about my levels.. i always hear ladies talking about levels and all that. im going on 14 weeks and nothing has been said to me about any of this. i am diabetic and have been before i got pregnant and sometimes i think they are paying more attention to that then they are the baby.all measurs right in my ultra sounds and the heart beat is good as well. 167. i am sure things are alright but im just wondering. i do not have to give urine at every appointment\u00a0\u00a0and have only had blood work done one time but i go to the doctor every two weeksplease advise",
