    "question": "Hi there,about 3 years ago I started getting sores/spots on my bottom.\u00a0\u00a0They would appear every 1-2 months for round about 2 weeks at a time.\u00a0\u00a0I still get them now but only every 3-4 months for 4-5 days.\u00a0\u00a0They always re-appear in the same place.\u00a0\u00a0Also 2 years ago I started getting headaches and dizzy spells\u00a0\u00a0which got progressively worse.\u00a0\u00a0I am now on tablets for lowering my blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I had blood tests done which I think were to check for diabetes and such.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that resulted out of the tests was that I had a low count of red blood cells.\u00a0\u00a0Would the test have picked up any STD's or does it have to be a specific test to find this?\u00a0\u00a0I have been a regular with a sex-worker so I think chances of an STD is high.\u00a0\u00a0At the time I mentioned the sores but the doctor couldn't see them as they were \"gone\" during examination and it's very difficult to time an appointment when they are back especially when it takes a week to get an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0The main thing I am worried about is the headaches and dizziness which the doctor can't explain.",
