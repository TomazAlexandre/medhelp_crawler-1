            "answer": "Hi,How have you coped emotionally after the breakup?Have you been with someone else since then?Did you experience any physical trauma specific to your organ?Is there any family history of diabetes?Have you had any weight changes since your relationship ended?There could be many reasons for ED. Some of them are lifestyle factors that can be modified.You need to have yourself evaluated to rule out underlying causes like diabetes that affect the neurological aspects of sexual behavior.Additionally, smoking can bring about deficiencies in vitamin B-complex and results in neuropathies which can also manifest as sexual dysfunction. It would be a good idea to start some vitamin B-complex supplements.You can also try the cialis as advised by your doctor to see whether the problem is really related to any physiological deficit.Activity such as sports and exercise release adrenaline and necessary endorphins that help you stay healthy and maintain normal appetites.Do keep us posted on your doubts and progress.Regards",

            "answer": "hello,to answer your questions:After the break up i stayed out of serious relationships for 3 years. Within those years i had maybe 3-4 sexual activities - mostly failures. I started experiencing problems in the last 6 months of my 3 year relationship when things were falling apart and we would rarely engage in sexual activity (just presex foreplay). Now i am in a serious relationship but with no sexual activity yet. I just got my blood results from the doctor for prolactin, testosterone levels, sperm count...etc and they were all normal and healthy. I have no history of diabetes in my family, and my weight fluctuated pretty good. During the last 6 months of my 3 year relationship i lost i would say about 25-30 lbs. and now i gained them back. oh and.. emotionally after the break up i was withdrawn. I would not feel the courage/motivation to talk to girls, flirt, or approach any. I was very nice, friendly, easy going, agreeable to everyone, and after that relationship my attitude changed i became less outgoing, social, nice and friendly...and i noticed especially that i had a sense of bitterness towards girls in general and i would treat them not so sweetly and nicely as i used to - I would always expect the worst out of them. So i guess thats why I couldn't get an errection... don't get me wrong i still felt attracted ot them but did not want to get aroused by them. I dunno if this information is too much, or just confusing... you might immediately jump to a conclusions that i'm having a serious psychological issue.. but, its been 3 years, i know i moved on... why can't my organ do the same :P.I liked the vitamin B idea.. are their just pills? a drink? or a certain type of food i should eat more that contains Vitamin B. oh and.. just vitamin B or B6 , B12..etc",

            "answer": "Hi Alex,Everything that we experience touches us at the psychological level. Such is the mystery and beauty of the psyche.So it is possible that the experience you have been through (though 3 years ago) is yet to undergo resolution.Loss of weight, decreased sexual pleasure, impaired sexual activity point toward anhedonia, a part of depression.It is possible that you are stronger and have escaped the trauma I am talking about, but, the damage could also be a possibility.Have you tried the cialis? It would be good to know if that helped so we can figure out if there is a physiological deficit.Vitamin B-complex includes the ones you have mentioned as well as a few more. You can take supplements or derive them from natural sources, such as green leafy vegetables, chicken or mutton liver, sprouts, etc.You may also want to start taking DHA (docosa hexaenoic acid) which is available in cod liver oil (cod liver oil capsules 2 per day) as this will help with the mood aspect.Do keep us posted.Regards",

            "answer": "Hello again,so far things are a little better but yesterday the problem concerned me more. I noticed little red dots or spots on the head of my penis after fellatio, and it hurt a lot when she applied sucking pressure on it. just the tip hurt. my erection stayed at 50-60% all the while she was going at it. So i told her to stop. What is wrong with me ?she was not that attractive but.. i do not think that is the main reason",

    "question": "I am 25, had a 3 year-long relationship which ended in year-long break up...she was abusive verbally and 1-2 physically. called me things like ******-mothef****r...etc. I've been smoking cigarettes and other since i was 18, not too too much..an avergae 3 packs a week. During the break up and now i've been having weird ED, cant keep it up.. the head hurts when i rub it against something (e.g. bed), and it changes colors alot gets to dark purple up to black when i masturbate. Sometimes i cant keep it up during masterbation and finish while its half raw which does not feel too pleasant. I went talked to 3 different doctors, they did not run major tests just feels and blood tests. Everything seemed normal in the blood and healthy except twice i had high levels of prolactin, but then i stopped smoking the other kind for a month and the levels dropped gr8ly until very good levels. So i thought everything would be better... it never did. So the doctors suggested it is stress and anxiety (psychological) so they suggested to take once or twice Cialis to get myself back in the circle of confidence. I did not try that yet..i'm a little concerned that even then it would not work. No on understands, i have a strong feeling that it has something to do with blood circulation. its like i'm stuck in second gear when i have an erection.. it reaches 50%, if i keep touching manually it does better, but if i let go for 5 seconds it goes back down! what can i do !? Especially what about blood circulation? it also shrinks more often especially when i exercise...I also think, what if my method of masterbating is wrong.. maybe i grip too hard to the point where it lost sensitivity.. i remember when i was 18-20, and i would shower sometimes i point the water pressure of the ****** and it would feel nice to the point of errection. now i point it down there and i feel nothing!
