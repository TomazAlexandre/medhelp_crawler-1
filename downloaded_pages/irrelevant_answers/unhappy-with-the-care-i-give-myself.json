    "question": "I need help. I have been a diabetic for 21 years now. Just last year I started trying to figure out what worked and didn't work for me. My current control method includes Coffee w. Sweetner (Stevia in the raw) & creamer (powder), water, dinner & excersize (riding a bicycle or walking & climbing stairs). My diet is uncontrolled, my daily schedule is out of control as is my sugar level. Please someone help me! I need a support group and don't have one currently. If you wish to contact me outside this form please send an e-mail to me at: ***@**** Thanks!",
