(post eating)testing your BG 1 hour after eating will tell you how well your body processes carbohydrates.You can have a good A1c and still have large fluctuations in BG.\u00a0\u00a0Large BG fluctuations are not good and can lead to early neuropathy.Some people find that 1800 mg a day of ALA (Alpha-lopaic Acid) helps with neuropathy",

            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0An a1c of 6 gives you an average blood sugar of about 130. We don't know how high you go after eating.If you are susceptible this may be enough to cause neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Consider a non diabetic a1c is in the range of 4.3 to 4.6 with average blood sugar in the 80s.I do think you sound be checked for other causes.\u00a0\u00a0Also know that neuropathy can happen in a sense of diabetes.However I do think that a more aggressive management of your diabetes is warranted with the Sutton of meds to try to bring your a1c down. Read diabetes Asotin by Dr Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0You could also watch his u tube lectures.\u00a0\u00a0Bernstein diabetes university.\u00a0\u00a0From him you can learn why and how to normalize blood sugars.",

    "question": "I am new to this community; however, I know that there is a lot of wisdom here. I certainly look forward to being the beneficiary of your individual (and collective) experience.I was diagnosed with type 2 in August of 2014 and my A1c at diagnosis was 6.8. After moping around and dealing with the shock, I decided that I was going to manage this with diet and exercise -- WITHOUT MEDICATION.Four months after diagnosis, I brought my A1c down to 6.4 -- mostly with diet.Three months later, I brought it further down to 6.3This month -- May 2015, I brought it down to 6.0In other words within 9 months since the diagnosis, I have been able to drag my A1c from 6.8 to 6.0.I saw an endocrinologist, and a CDE nurse recently, and they applauded my efforts. I asked them whether I missed anything by not taking medication. The Endo said \"No', and advised me to stick with whatever I have been doing.All of the above sounded like good news to me EXCEPT that I cannot explain away the constant neuropathy I feel under my feet. Now I am also feeling burning sensation and my little toes.What Gives?If I am doing so well with the A1c numbers and my diet, why this persistent burning under my feet, and NOW on my toes. It is worse when I have shoes on -- which is most of my waking hours.I need your wisdom PLEASE.Thanks -- Tie",
