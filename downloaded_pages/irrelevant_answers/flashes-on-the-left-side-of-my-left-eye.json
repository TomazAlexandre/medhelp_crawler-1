    "question": "Today I experienced what appeared to be a \"floater\" in my left eye while I was reading. It would move when I moved my eye back and forth, I then thought it was a scratch on my cornea (without the pain) Two hours later I was walking to my kitchen when I saw a vertical line flash to the periferal of my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0I could make it happen by looking\u00a0\u00a0to the right, but not consistantly. I had monovision lasik surgery 5 years ago and have never had any problems. The left eye is my reading or near-sighted eye. I have no obstruction or change in my vision. I am 60 year old female RN, healthy, active, working in a hospital, no diabetes, I take a low dose of Lisinopril for mild hypertension.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/372609\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/372609</a>.",
