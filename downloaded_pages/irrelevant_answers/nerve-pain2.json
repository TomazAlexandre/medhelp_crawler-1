            "answer": "Thank you for your question. These symptoms could be due the parasthesia (numbness or tingling) that develops during diabetic neuropathy. This neuropathy appears as a tingling sensation on skins and appears after long standing diabetes. Another possibility could be any pinched nerve, but this possibility remains low as her MRI reports are normal. Controlling the diabetes will be mainstay of stopping the aggravation of symptoms. If she suffers continuous tingling sensation or other symptoms, please arrange an appointment with a neurologist right away who will evaluate the possibilities here and can provide her an appropriate treatment. Hope this information proves helpful to you.",
