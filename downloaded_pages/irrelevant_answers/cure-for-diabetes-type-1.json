            "answer": "Hello, Anette.\u00a0\u00a0We are not medical professionals, just parents of diabetics or diabetics ourselves, so always check with your doctor about anything you find here.\u00a0\u00a0There are many companies who claim to have cures for diabetes based in herbs or special pills or something, but they are just hoaxes.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, there are ways to 'cure' diabetes, but they are not easy or cheap.One is called an islet cell transplant.\u00a0\u00a0Since the islet cells of a diabetic (which produce insulin) are no longer functioning, the thought is to replace those with functioning cells.\u00a0\u00a0It's a procedure called the Edmonton Protocol, named after the city of the university where the procedure was developed.\u00a0\u00a0Here's a link that explains the procedure:http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/pancreaticislet/The procedure can allow diabetics to live without the need for external insulin, but they also must take immuno-suppressant drugs for the rest of their lives.\u00a0\u00a0Read the link for more details.\u00a0\u00a0There have only been like 600 people who have ever had this procedure done, from what I remember, and it's because it is very, very difficult to get enough islet cells to make a successful transplantAnother is a full pancreas transplant.\u00a0\u00a0A functioning pancreas is transplanted from a donor to a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0This one is more common, but not by much, because of the difficulty of getting donor pancreases.\u00a0\u00a0It is also a very invasive surgery, which limits the number of people who are interested.\u00a0\u00a0But this can also allow a diabetic to live insulin-free, but also having to take immuno-suppressants for life.There have been many reports of research where diabetes has been cured in mice or monkeys or some other animal, but those results have never been able to be translated to humans.\u00a0\u00a0There was recently reports on a procedure done in Brazil on kids as young as 14 using stem cells which has reversed the diabetes of 12 of 15 of the kids in the test.\u00a0\u00a0It is a procedure which is not allowed in the US because of how dangerous it is.\u00a0\u00a0It is also only possible for people very early in their diagnosis who are still in their honeymoon.\u00a0\u00a0This is a very dangerous procedure, and it's not a cure for all.\u00a0\u00a0There does create the hope, though, that a cure for all is possible.",

            "answer": "RL has given you some good information. The real problem so far is that the \"damaged\" immune system attacks any new cells that are put in place via transplant or grown from islet cells. And the autoimmune-suppressing drugs have side effects of their own and cause other serious problems. So with these problems, these procedures are not considered for any but the most seriously ill -- people who risk death if transplants are not done. The many of us who live healthy lives except for having to monitor our glucose levels and take insulin injections are not considered for these procedures. No, there is no cure at this point. A child who is diagnosed as a type 1 diabetic will have this disease the rest of his or her life unless some medical breakthrough happens in coming years.The good news is that treatments have come so far that it is very possible to live a completely normal life as a type 1 diabetic. I am a very healthy grandma, diabetic since age 12 with no problems. There are many of us who have lived many years with the disease and have normal lives.",
