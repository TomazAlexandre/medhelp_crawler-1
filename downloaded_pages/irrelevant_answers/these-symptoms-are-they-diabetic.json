She has gotten eczema on her hands and on her face. ...She has been very tired and sometimes very grouchy...And her periods are sometimes very irregular lasting two weeks and with only a few days without it. She has gained about 30 pounds in the last year. She says that her back hurts and legs hurt alot intermittently..This all began with apendicitis and the removal of her apendix..since then she has not been the same..What do you think?? Could this be diabetes? I had gestational diabetes while pregnant with her and her sisters.",
