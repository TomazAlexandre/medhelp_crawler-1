Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.Erectile dysfunction and impotence are quite common with diabetic neuropathy. I would advice a regular monitoring of blood sugar levels, and EMG to check out abnormal responses. Further consultation to a diabetologist would help you to reach at appropriate treatment here. Hope this information proves helpful to you.",

    "question": "I have been a type 2 diabetic for about 13 years now.\u00a0\u00a0I have not taken as much care as I should've with my diabetes. I take oral medications now.\u00a0\u00a0My morning blood levels are usually in the 130's. I have noticed recently that it is getting longer and harder to achieve orgasm during sex.\u00a0\u00a0There is a lack of sensation from my penis. It is starting to get in the way of me and my girlfriends relationship. I'm 43 years old. This started about 1 month ago. My feet are sensitive and from time to time burn, I have marbeling in my lower legs from the micro vessels rupturing. However that has been that way for a couple of years and has not worsened. I take Cialis from time to time and erections are still only at 60% and maintaining any erection is still problematic. Now that there is less sensation it is difficult to achieve orgasm.\u00a0\u00a0Please help.",
