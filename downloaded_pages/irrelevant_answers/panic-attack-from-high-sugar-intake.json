            "answer": "What's more likely is that you had what is colloquially called a sugar rush, meaning you ate a lot of simple sugars, metabolized them quite quickly, and threw off you're body's ability to balance itself.\u00a0\u00a0Continually doing this creates problems with metabolism and eventually Type 2 diabetes in some people.\u00a0\u00a0Others can handle it without a problem, but you are you.\u00a0\u00a0The anxiety attack was probably caused by the feelings you felt from the sugar rush, which are similar to what you'd feel from an anxiety attack, and since you've had anxiety attacks before you were pushed into that pattern.\u00a0\u00a0Go easy on that sugar, it's been a problem of mine, too.",

            "answer": "A few months ago, I was taking in so much sugar (high fructose corn syrup as it said on the labels) and this one night I basically took shots of sugar so I felt exactly what you described. I've had panic attacks in the past before so the overwhelming adrenaline immediately got me anxious. I also got that \" chill wave\" starting from my head to my body. I was with friends and I started acting like a baby asking for favors (water, a blanket, etc.) whenever anyone walked out of the room, it made me loose my **** so I started begging them to not leave and just cuddle around me (so humiliating but measures were desparate) anyway, I've completely cut out sugars (not even fruits) because it gives me mild anxiety. I can only eat small amounts of carbs (I bake kale with oil and salt and it works and taste great). I have to be annoying guy always asking for the ingredients of the food at restaurants because if I slack, the consequences will be great. It's been 4 and half months and i still get heavy anxiety if I eat sugar even small bits (fruit sugar aka the healthy sugar). It's been tough because even though sugar is bad for not just me but everyone, I still miss it. I went to the doc to get a blood test and sugar was a bit high but no diabetes or pre-diabetes (5 months of low carbs and my fasting blood sugar was still kinda high. I can't imagine how high it must've been on the day of the attack) The way things are going, Im estimating 2-3 years of sugar diligence until I can take a bite out of a donut without a sweat. I know this post is 8 years old so I'd love to hear how you've been doing so that I can get a better picture of what my life is going to be like in the near future. Thanks for reading!",
