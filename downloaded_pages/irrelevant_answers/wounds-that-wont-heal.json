            "answer": "HHiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If your blood work included test for diabetes, then this is ruled out, else, you will need to test for diabetes. If this was borderline in tests then follow this up with a glucose tolerance test.Discuss with your surgeon, the possibility of development of a fistula that could be hampering closure due to continuous passage of fluids and secretions.Possibility of poor blood supply to area by duplex ultrasound should be tested.Swabs from the wound should be sent for culture and sensitivity. Maybe the treatment is not effective.If there is underlying dermatitis, then this needs to be taken care of. Wound debridement would be required along with plastic repair. If there is severe atherosclerosis preventing blood supply to wound, then this needs to be diagnosed by angiograms. Also too tight skin being stitched up can break open the wound when there is pressure on the wound.It would be a good idea to consult the surgeon regarding plastic repair by skin graft, after taking care of underlying cause.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
