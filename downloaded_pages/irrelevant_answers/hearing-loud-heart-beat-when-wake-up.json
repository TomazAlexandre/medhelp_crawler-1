            "answer": "Thanks for the comment.I am not sure whether the heart beat wakes me up. But I have no problem of sleeping through the night. The sound is lound and clear, sometimes a little fast, but not too fast. During the day, I have not problem at all.\u00a0\u00a0I saw two cardiologists and both said my heart is ok. None of them can answer why this happen. Of course, something is happening, we (icluding the doctors I saw) just\u00a0\u00a0do not know what it is.By the way, I have diabetes for about 20 or more years (I am 70 now). It seems that it is under control.",

            "answer": "Just a long shot but it might be some form of sleep apnea. Snoring,Vivid dreams, fast heart rate, and low o2 sleeping are just some but not all of the pointers. You don't have to have full blown\u00a0\u00a0apnea to have sleep problems. My cardiologist cleared my heart but\u00a0\u00a0just happened to know a lot about sleep apnea, many do not even think of it. I have a mild form but just bad enough to trigger afib twice. I will be getting a cpap soon. My father in law is almost 60 and is just been told he has mild apnea.",
