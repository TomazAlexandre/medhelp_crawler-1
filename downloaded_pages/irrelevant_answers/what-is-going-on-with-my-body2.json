            "answer": "Wow, I have never heard of that disease. So far they've looked at Lupus and Sjogren's and RA. My ANA has gone up and down...and the specific antibodies were negative for both. My RA factor was normal each time tested. However, my c-reactive protein has always been slightly elevated (since November).I forgot to mention that I also have really bad heartburn, which I didn't have prior to November when my other symptoms arose. I also have extreme pain in my feet when I first get out of bed. It hurts to take steps. Not sure what that is caused by.What are your symptoms?",

    "question": "Okay, so...I have had some strange, unexplained symptoms since November (it's almost April) and I am really at my ends of trying to deal with these problems will trying to juggle college and work and just wanting to be my old \"normal\" 20 year old self.Muscle achesSporatic Joint pain - mostly all joints - most severe in kneesSEVERE fatigueAches/feeling of uncomfort all overMuscle twitching (have had my whole life, but I notice more now)Sick a lot - i.e. laringytis, UTI, bad cold, gastroenteritis (bad enough to put me in the hospital) ---> sick constantly, back to back illnessesdry eyesdry mouthMy ANA was tested in November--was negative (along with rheumatoid factor and other autoimmune things), in December it was 1:640 homogeneous, in February it was negative again. Nobody in my family has an autoimmune disorder. The only thing in my family (other than cancer and type 2 diabetes) is that one of my cousins had ALS (a form of muscular dystrophy) and one of my cousins has hypogammaglobulinemia (an immuno-deficiency disease.) I am taking a NSAID for the joint pain. But, I feel sick all the time. I am constantly sick....and when I'm not sick (like with a cold or UTI) i just feel horrible. I'm severly fatigued and the joint pain is at times not bearable.Does anybody have any possible ideas?! I can't continue to deal with this while in college. It's too much, I just want answers!!",
