            "answer": "hi steph!i had those symptoms too, before they tested me for diabetes. I was soooooo thirsty all the time, and tired too. I cant think of any other symptoms. But i was dionased with G/d around 12 wks. blah! And he put me on a diet, etc, etc. and i had been keeping to the diet pretty good, even had to go on insulin..not bad though, i thought it'd be worse. just expensive.lately i've been slippin with the diet, eaten out to much.i haven't gained any weight yet, not unless this eating out this wk probably hsn't helped..but i think they usually test for g/d around 28 wks, but u could tell your dr about your symptoms, and he may test earlier. if you do have g/d u defintily want to know so u can keep it under control. Baby can be born very big due to untreated g/d. and that's not good for baby, so much sugar, it's more than babys body can handle, my dr explained and that's the reason for large baby..but the thirst could just be a symptom from u being dehydrated from being sick, i dk?well i hope u feel better real soon!",
