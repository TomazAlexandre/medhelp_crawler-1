My legs are a little \"weary\" and tired, but nothing drastic. I don't think my strength is affected. And in general I feel fine not counting these ridiculous sensations - just stressed out from all this!",

            "answer": "Bilateral is untypical but it isn't completely unheard of, what would be more abnormal for MS would be symptoms that are a symmetrical presentation, bilateral and symmetrical is usually associated with the spine because it's theoretically impossible for a lesion or lesions in the brain to be the cause, for it to happen they'd coincidentally need to develop in all the right locations at the exact same time, and even then i'd think having symmetrical damage would be really strange....It's actually less likely to be caused by a neurological condition if your spinal MRI is perfectly normal, exactly what i'm sorry but i don't know, it's possible the Paresthesia is a secondary issue eg vit deficientcy, peri diabetes-diabetes etc but I think your going to have to keep an open mind, you've got a lot more tests to go before you'll get your answers.Hope that helps..........JJ",

    "question": "I have posted a related question and thanks to everyone who responded - with some new info, I decided to start a new discussion. So if some of this looks familiar, it might be!My saga began with a tingling/pins and needles feeling in both feet in the middle of May, 3 months ago. Within a few days it had progressed up my shins and thighs - and with one exception (which I'll mention in a minute), it has stayed in my feet, lower and upper legs ever since. I would describe the feelings as a mixture of tingling, pins and needles (not to the point of actually \"falling asleep), static-like effect on the surface of the skin, prickles, slight buzzing. These symptoms have been with me every single day since this all began. Yes, they flare up worse at some moments than others, but basically are always there to some extent. Also, they are definitely in BOTH feet and legs. That's not to say there aren't times when at that particular moment one leg is feeling more sensations than the other - but that never lasts for very long before it's back to both feeling the same. In other words, in general both sides present these sensations at the same time. And, as I said, it started with both feet (as opposed to one side).The one exception to my feet/legs has occurred just over the past 2-3 weeks. I sometimes have a burning sensation on my inner wrists/forearms - not as constant as my feet/legs symptoms. This burning sensation on my arms is always on both sides, at same time, and very symmetrical.My B12 was borderline low, and doctor thought that was the cause. However, after 10 weeks of twice weekly injections, I don't see any change. Sometimes I think I do just very slightly, but immediately goes back to as bad as ever. My vitamin D was at the very lowest end of normal, so I've been taking supplements of that for 6 weeks and assume it's higher into the good range again.Anyway, here's the most recent information - yesterday I had an MRI of all three parts of the spine (my doctor thought perhaps I had transverse myelitis... and probably caused by the influenza I had around March 1). But everything was completely clear - no TM lesions, no MS lesions, no tumors, no spinal stenosis or disc problems, etc.. I realize I also need to get a brain MRI and that is what is really, really scaring me. I am so very frightened they'll find MS.HOWEVER, if this is MS - it sounds like it's an extremely unusual presentation. Isn't it weird that my very first symptom would be paresthesia on BOTH sides - bilateral? And involve both legs AND now both arms? And it also seems like this is hanging around longer than a typical episode. Plus, I have zero of any other MS symptom I can think of. I'm not even especially tired/fatigued. Don't get me wrong, I know paresthesia is very common in MS! But I'm under the impression it often goes along with other symptoms, or doesn't last very long, goes away and comes back, etc...And if this is NOT MS - then what the heck is it?? Because something is definitely screwed up with me.Could it be a weird G. Barre Syndrome? Or CIDP? Or idiopathic neuropathy? Or still the B12? Or ???I have an appointment with a neurologist and obviously will get a brain MRI. In the meantime, what do you think?",
