    "question": "Hi. I'm a 20 year old male, and in August of 2004, I started noticing that wounds and cuts would take forever to heal. And by forever, I mean it takes a few months for even a scratch to completely go away. They always leave behind a light scar for a long time, than eventually goes away, but still leaves my skin a bit darker where it was. Any time I get a wound, they always get very red...something they never did before. I also noticed that when I'm sleeping, I have been cutting off my circulation a lot more than I ever did, in places like my arms and sometimes legs. I will wake up and change position and it goes away. ALSO, my skin doesnt appear to be as sensative as it used to be. If I lightly touch my skin, I can hardly feel it. Other than all this, I seem to be in perfect health, and I'm very athletic and active.Anyone heard of stuff like this?Evan",
