            "answer": "Hi,How are you? What other symptoms are present? Muscle vibration may indeed be associated with neurological issues such as nerve injury as well as other conditions like dehydration, nutritional deficiencies, dehydration, or muscle problems. If it persists, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for proper evaluation. Your medical history and complete neurological examination are important in determining the underlying cause. Additional diagnostic tests may also be done. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I am a 65 year old very healthy female, walk a mile a day, take no meds except HRT patch.\u00a0\u00a0About 6 month ago I noticed a buzzing feeling in my feet and ankles.\u00a0\u00a0This is not tingling as in diabetes, but much like having a bee in a jar and shaking it.\u00a0\u00a0Lately, I wake up in the morning and my jaw, neck and upper arms are doing the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0I thought it was my heart going into a jackhammer mode, but on checking my pulse, it is, as usual, slow and steady.\u00a0\u00a0I do have low blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0This feeling usually passes upon rising and does not reoccur any other time in the day.\u00a0\u00a0I have read that finding some neurological cause can be exhausting with all of the tests the seem to come to no conclusion.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions??",
