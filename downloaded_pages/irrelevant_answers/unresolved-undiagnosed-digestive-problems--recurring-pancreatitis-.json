            "answer": "My first thought is diabetic gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0Google that phrase along with the word SYMPTOMS, and see if you think it could be a match.\u00a0\u00a0It is a nerve problem.Supposedly there are not many treatments for it, so keeping your diabetes under control is most important.\u00a0\u00a0I would talk to others with diabetes; some of them are dealing with this also.\u00a0\u00a0I would think the enzymes are fine.\u00a0\u00a0I take many supplements to aid my digestion, although I don't think mine is gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0You might try magnesium citrate tablets in the morning, glutamate powder in a beverage such as coconut milk or almond milk, and a probiotic.\u00a0\u00a0Others I take include L-glutamine.\u00a0\u00a0I get enzymes in my whole food vitamin and also my new probiotic.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "SYMPTOMS: early satiety, nausea, trapped gas, and bloating, constipation and diarrhea.\u00a0\u00a0A battery of tests were done, including colonoscopy, upper endoscopy (hiatal hernia) esophageal motility (muscle doesn't work well), stomach emptying.\u00a0\u00a0All normal.\u00a0\u00a0I've been hospitalized with pancreatitis twice in the last 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have type2 diabetes, I'm overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 60 year old African American female.DIAGNOSIS:\u00a0\u00a0My gastroenterologist came up with nothing Murilax and Amitiza.\u00a0\u00a0Not very effective. After doing research on my own, I discovered digestive enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0I've purchased some from Enzymedica that have helped tremendously, but not totally--because I don't know enough about my needs.\u00a0\u00a0I just discovered through research that there is a LIPASE TEST This test is done to check the pancreas for disease, most often acute pancreatitis.\u00a0\u00a0There are probably more tests to see if there are enzymatic deficiencies, I imagine.QUESTION: Why didn't the gastroenterologist suggest any of these tests?\u00a0\u00a0What's the likely diagnosis & treatment?\u00a0\u00a0More importantly, where can I look to find physicians who incorporate this type of diagnostic tool to come up with a diagnosis in my area Chicago and NW Suburbs?",
