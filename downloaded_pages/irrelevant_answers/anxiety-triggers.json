            "answer": "I know how you I went through a similar thing last year and am still going through it. There are certain places I can go by myself but I fear that I will have an anxiety attack. My husband tells me to stop step away somewhere,\u00a0\u00a0where there are no or little people and just breath. So I say just breath you will be ok.\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety is nothing funny and is not easy to just get over. I'm sorry your family feels or treats you that way. It will take some time to get through but you can do it.Maybe you should sit your husband and try to explain how you feel and what and how difficult it is to do certain things. Also let him that how he acts affects you.I hope this helps. Good luck.",

            "answer": "It would be great if you could have your family do some research on anxiety and it's symptoms. People that don't have it just can not understand what it feels like. They do need to be supportive though. What if your husband or someone in your family had diabetes or some other illness? You would be supportive of them would'nt you? So would everyone else in the family.",

    "question": "I start at the beginning a few weeks ago we had someone come in the apartment while i was home in bed. They came up the stairs to our bedroom and tugged on the fitted sheet. The police said they had to have had a key toget in. Since then everytime i leave the apartment or am out to long i start to panice and can't breath. I know its anxiety and this isnt my first go around with something like this. I havent felt like my family takes this serious. My husband makes jokes and my grandmother just goes on and acts like i need to let it go. In the end they have made it worse its almost been a month since ive been out on my own. How do you walk through it when no one understands",
