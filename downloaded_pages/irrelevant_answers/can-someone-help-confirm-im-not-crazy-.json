    "question": "OK so my ex isn't entirely sure he is the father of the child I'm pregnant with. I say he is and I'm totally sure. So this is kind of just to confirm that I know what I think I do and I'm not crazy..OK so I slept with someone else between Jan 16-jan 25 (I don't remember exactly when).I slept with my ex several times from Feb 5- Feb 13. My lmp was Feb 13.I found out I was pregnant on 03/23/15 via a clinical pregnancy test.\u00a0\u00a0Which put my due date at 11/20/15.I had an ultrasound at 17w5d and the BC of the U/S my due date is now 11/11/15.I believe that with how pregnancy is actually dated (from lmp and not actual conception) that there is no way that the first person could be the father. Can anyone help me",
