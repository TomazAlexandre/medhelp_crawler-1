            "answer": "First - find a new doctor! I know how it is when doctors don't listen. I walked around hyperthyroid for so many years (with nodules in my throat) with doctors just saying it's all in my head. Well, guess what? It wasn't in my head - it was in my throat. I would find another doctor - and depending where you are - I'm sure there are some people who can recommend a good doctor. Did they say if the nodules were hot or cold? Either way, find a doctor who cares.Good Luck",

            "answer": "The first Endo I went to didn't tell me, but he specialized in Diabetes.When I went into his exam room and he came in, we started to chat. My complete medical history was sitting on his little table. He knew I was coming for two weeks.The top page of my medical history was a letter of introduction from my GP, detailing my problems and his concern for my health. The second page down was my latest bloodwork, showing I was extremely Hyperthyroid.He never looked at any of it. Interviewed me, declared me Hypo, and told me to ignore my GP and go back on my Synthroid, as ceasing to take it had caused my complaints.He was a busy man who had no time to actually look at my records or bother to read ANYTHING about thyroids before seeing me.Doctors are people just like you and me. Some excell at their profession, others just get by because there are so many patients they always have a job, even if they are lousy at it.The worst part is, around here Endos are in short supply, so if you want to \"shop around\", it may take six months to see three different doctors.",

            "answer": "With you family\u00a0\u00a0history of cancer, it is very important to find out not only if your nodules are hot or cold, but you most likely need a biopsy (aka fine needle aspiration {FNA}).\u00a0\u00a0You definitely need to find a new endo, even if you have to travel to Chicago to find one.\u00a0\u00a0Many endo specialize in diabetes, so make sure when you're looking for a new endo to ask if they specialize in thyroids.\u00a0\u00a0I was fortunate and found my endo on the first try thru a recommendation from my primary physician.",

    "question": "hi,I am writing this mostly because i came back from my first appointment with an endo, and i am very confused, and angry, and scared. I had a thyroid ultrasound done in august, because of a fluke lump that was felt by my doc. It came back as having found multiple nodules on my thyroid, and also on my parathyroid. now at my appt yesterday with this endo doc he asked me how old i was i said 34 .. without much more question his reply was we'll do another ultrasound in six months and see if there is change.. my concern first is that they had given me a symptom check list to which almost all applied to me, he didn't even look at it , i know he didn't because\u00a0\u00a0when i asked him if any of these symptoms would go away he asked \" what symptoms\". Now for the last ten years my doctor has always said that my thyroid looks enlarged, but my blood test always come back normal,although i know i don't feel right. my symptoms, heart palpatations , trembling, feel shaky\u00a0\u00a0,heat intolerance, and cold intolerance , have trouble getting to sleep, and most recently having difficulty swallowing.. i feel like something is always stuck. family history.. my grama had her full thyroid removed a couple of years ago she had cancer. my aunt also the same thing.. now other types of cancer runs in my family.. Someone please give some advice...",
