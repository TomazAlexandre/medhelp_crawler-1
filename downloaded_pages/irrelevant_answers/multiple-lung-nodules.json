            "answer": "Multiple lung nodules, often sizable, can be seen with non-Hodgkins lymphoma (NHL).\u00a0\u00a0This can also be seen with hematogenous or blood-borne metastatic cancer and with infectious disease, especially fungal.\u00a0\u00a0A chest radiologist should be able to suggest the most likely diagnosis, based on nodule size, shape, variation in size, distribution etc., but a biopsy will almost certainly be required to establish the exact diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Your information that 80% of multiple nodules are due to metastatic solid organ malignancies may be a little high but probably not by much.\u00a0\u00a0Rarely, tuberculosis can present in this fashion.\u00a0\u00a0It and diabetes and NHL can all be associated with fever and night sweats.The sooner the diagnosis is established and treatment begun, the better.\u00a0\u00a0Should these be large nodules, it may be possible to make the diagnosis by bronchoscopy or by trans-thoracic needle biopsy/aspiration.\u00a0\u00a0If not, video-assisted thoracic surgery (VATS) may be required.Good luck",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Non-hodgkins lymphoma in 2003; had a lesion in my stomach probably caused by H.pylori.\u00a0\u00a0Recently my routine chest-ab-pelvis X-ray revealed growing lung nodule in lower left lobe of my lung (60 yrs old; smoked for 20 years; quit 20 years ago, my mother died of lung cancer).\u00a0\u00a0A more specific chest CT scan revealed multiple nodules and I am scheduled to see a pulmonologist soon.I read that 80% of multiple nodules are due to metastatic solid organ malignancies.\u00a0\u00a0With my history what is the chance that this is a recurrence of lymphoma in my lungs?Symptoms include night sweats, which I do have frequently.\u00a0\u00a0However I am a severe type I diabetic and thought these night sweats were caused by blood sugar changes in the night?\u00a0\u00a0Can I assume this is a symptom of diabetes or NHL?",
