            "answer": "Check out the following web article on skin conditions in diabetics:http://www.dermadoctor.com/pages/newsletter231.aspThe doctor who wrote the article discusses a number of skin conditions found typically in both type 1 and type 2 diabetics. I believe the one you are interested in is called Acanthosis Nigricans. The writer discusses it and gives suggestions about treatments. I do not know if the treatments require a physician's prescription or if they are over-the-counter, but you could discuss with your own doctor.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Diabetes and I was researching answers for different questions when I came across a forum on this site. It talked about how a sign in young children for diabetes was that they would have discoloration on thier necks, almost like neck dirt. Ive had this for as long as I can remeber.Sometimes it is lighter but it is always a much different color then my skin tone. I was wondering if there was anyway to get rid of it? Any certain product? Routine? What causes it?",
