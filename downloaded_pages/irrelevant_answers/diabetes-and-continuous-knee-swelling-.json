            "answer": "Hi,the medical team will not consider a TKR when there is infection, as the replacement would likely fail under such condition.Your father may need to work both with General medicine to get the infection under control and hopefully cured, and also with endocrinologist to get his blood sugar under good control, which will also help with the infection.The key reason his infection is not getting better may be related to high blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Normalising blood sugars with insulin and/ diet (low carb typically works best) will be a good approach to help him do as well as possible.",

    "question": "My father is 74 yrs old and suffering from joint pain. 7 months back Ortho Doctor advised for knee replacement(TKR) and admitted to hospital but because of hard swelling in right side of the knee they did a small operation and removed the the hard swelling. It got some infections and because of Diabetes it took long time to heal and Ortho doctors are not giving care for healing the wound. The joint pain got increased and my father is not able walk at all.We went and consult a General Medicine who is specialist in diabetes care. After healing the first one one more swelling and got infected. This is continuing from past 6 months and had lot of antibiotics injections and tablets.His health is week now and not able to walk at all. The infection in knee is not curing. We are in a difficult situation now and Doctors are not telling the route cause and they are treating to heal the wound every-time instead of find the route cause. We have asked a TKR can cure this but they are not advising for TKR.Also we are confused now to go with Ortho or General Medicine to treat this. Appreciate your valuable suggestions to save my father and get him back to normal life.",
