            "answer": "It probably means that your blood sugars are still in the 'prediabetic' stage.Truly normal a1c is < 5.0 and fasting blood sugar is < 95.The good thing is, if you catch it early you may be able to manage things with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Lower carb diet and daily exercise should be very helpful.\u00a0\u00a0If you can get a meter and test after eating (1.5 - 2 hrs), then you should be able to find which foods raise your sugars (ideally < 120 at 1.5 - 2 hours post testing), and then you can modify your diet appropriately.Best wishes",
