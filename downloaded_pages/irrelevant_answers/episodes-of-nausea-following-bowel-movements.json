            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Patients with chronic pancreatitis have recurrent abdominal pain of varying intensity along with steatorrhea or oily foul smelling stool. Pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) are often normal. Actual diagnosis is confirmed by biopsy but it is never done as it is very risky. The gold standard of diagnosis is secretin stimulation test and is usually not done. Common tests used for diagnosis are fecal elastase in stool, serum trypsinogen, CT scan and ultrasounds (which often come back normal), MRI, ERCP and MRCP (all of which are more conclusive). Usually after chronic pancreatitis patients develop insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and this should be ruled out by fastin blood glucose, post prandial blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (a test which gives last 3 months control over blood glucose). Treatment is by analgesics and antioxidants. Surgical procedures like resection and drainage are often helpful. Other than that pancreatic enzyme supplementation helps restore pancreatic function to some extent.Please consult a hepatologist. Other than that it could be IBS and gastric reflux and you can take treatment for that. Increase fiber in diet. Take a late night snack. Raise head end of bed. Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks, caffeine, and spicy food.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I think i forgot to mention originally, that I did have an obdominal MRI last Nov after this all started. They didn't find anything in my pacreas, but that is when they found I had a fatty liver. After an MRI with no positive results, is that safe to say its not the pacreas? I mean, I don't want to end up with diabetes because my doc didn't do the right tests. Where is the pain normally located with pacreatitis? Because mine is located right at the gall bladder and liver. Its never severe, just a nuissance. I was convinced it was liver being inflamed by the fatty tissue. Therefore causing the pain, but my doc is set on the idea that my liver DOES NOT hurt. I've read elsewhere though, that fatty liver can cause pain and other symptoms. I just hate that she doesn't want to hear it. She always jumps to blaming the food, which I know can cause problems. But I am just not convinced that is my WHOLE problem.. I guess I am coming here to ask, because I don't feel my doc is getting me the answers I want.",

    "question": "My situation is pretty strange.. Last year for my 28th bday I drank WAY too much, and believe I suffered from alcohol poisoning. I was sick, but didn't go to the hospital. I had what I believed was a 5 day-ish hangover, and then started to feel better. About a week or so later, I was at work and had unbearable pains in my abdomen which i assumed were gas pains. I left work because i was uncomfortable, and once I got home I had a large bowel movement. Wouldn't call it diarrhea, but also wouldn't say it was normal. Following this incident, I felt off for weeks. In the week or so following this, I would wake up in the middle of the night with bad nausea, but never got sick. I was prescribed promethazine for the nausea, which helped. but i was still waking up with it for a couple days straight. I also noticed that i was getting a canker sore in my mouth, with a nasty taste which i assumed was acid coming up while i slept. I was also taking protonix twice a day at the time. i had an upper edoscopy then, and with my recent episode (a month ago) I had a colonoscopy to rule out crohns. My doc says i def. dont have that. Have had all blood tests come back normal. The most recent episode is still hanging around. I had trouble eating anything, without feeling yucky after. So I hardly ate, lost 10 lbs in a week. having pains in region with liver/gallbladder. But had a recent CT scan that didnt show any problems with either. I was diagnosed with fatty liver in Nov 09, but doc says that will not cause symptoms, and/or the pain I am experiencing. Doc is completely convinced its my IBS and acid reflux acting up to my bad diet. And I know I needed to change my diet, but I still believe something else inside must be reacting to what i'm eating to cause these symptoms. I call them episodes, because the symptoms hit suddenly, always feel worst before and after bowel movement. Then following this 2 week episode recently, I now feel like I am still \"recovering\" from the episode and am afraid to eat anything fatty. Not that I wanna jump back into a bad diet, but occassionally, you go out and cheat. So I am at a loss, I've had all the tests and no diagnosis. Doc thinks I am a hypochondriac, that I am trying to find something wrong with me when nothing is there. But I think its very strange that these episodes started following my birthday and incident of over drinking. Maybe it was coincidence that it started then, who knows. But I still feel something is wrong.. Anyone else have similar symptoms???",
