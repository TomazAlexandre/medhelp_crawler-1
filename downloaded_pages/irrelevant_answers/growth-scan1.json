    "question": "So I'm 36+ 2 days pregnant, yesterday I had my growth scan and they said my baby boy is already around 8 pound 11. I'm only going to 39 weeks as I'm having a c section. They say babies put on 1/2 a pound each week now. So I'm looking at roughly a 10 pounder roughly. Has anyone had this done and they have been wrong or spot I'm with the weight.",
