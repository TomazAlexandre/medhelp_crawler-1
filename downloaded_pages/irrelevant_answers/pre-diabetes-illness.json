            "answer": "My daughter was dxd just before she turned 6 yrs old. I thought she had the flu but when i took her to the doctor they said she had diabetes. Before that she wasn't sick a lot but had other symptoms but i didn't realize that's what they were until years later. She had bouts where she would sleep a lot and not want to do much, i think that's when her sugar was high. She would also get out of control with her behaviour, much like a kid with attention defecit. I would actually have to wrestle with her to get her to stay still and calm down. Now i think that's when she had bouts of hypoglycemia.Diabetes has so many symptoms and i believe that you can have those symptoms well before your diagnosed.",

    "question": "Hi can anyone tell me if they had any symtoms years before being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, because i was always ill at school and at work i would always feel light headed dizzy getting very hot and feel as if i was going to pass out. this has been happening years before i was diagnosed and wounder if it was due to the diabetes or something else. i was just diagnosed 67 weeks ago and the hypos i have been having seem very similar to how i was feeling before i was diagnosed, but my doctor told me i couldnt have been having a hypo as i wasnt taking insulin then. any ideas? thanx stacey",
