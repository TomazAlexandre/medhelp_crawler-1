            "answer": "Well i wouldnt run and change Drs right away, the reason i asked if you had already had previous bloodwork done was because if you had they might have already checked what your sugar was at the time and if you have had your urine checked it may have already shown a amall amount of sugar, or just that he may be considering you high risk for it from possible family hystory, weight, ect.If the result are normal i would assume you would still have the routine 24-28 week glucose check done again...Drs dont just do this for fun, its usually with their clients best interest for their safety... so there must be something that flagged him to test earlier... which for certain reasons does happen...talk to him and ask questions...",
