            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!This is something for which you will have to consult a vascular specialist. Vein thrombosis is best diagnosed by duplex ultrasound (color dopplar) or by angiogram. Vein thrombosis causes spider veins, redness on legs and a pitting edema that comes on and off. High blood pressure, kidney dysfunction, diabetes and hypothyroidism should be ruled out.Vein thrombosis is treatable, both medically and surgically. Stockings (tight compression) to press the lower extremity to aid circulation and medicines help many. If your husband takes these medicines and wears the stockings, the pain will reduce considerably. He should not walk for prolonged time or stand at one place for a long time. If he needs to, then he should keep moving his legs. At times stripping and sclerosing treatments help. He has to avoid things like alcohol, caffeine etc which increase the blood flow and tissue perfusion.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Take care!",
