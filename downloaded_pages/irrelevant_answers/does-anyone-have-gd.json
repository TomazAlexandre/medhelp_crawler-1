            "answer": "I am assuming you mean gestational diabetes??? I had it with my son and I was sent to see an endorcrinologist who set me up with scripts for testing supplies and a nurse visit to show me how to do finger sticks and follow the recommended diet plan. After a week or so i went back with numbers in hand (4x's a day needle sticks) and at that point because I had a family history he also prescribed me insulin injections once a day, even though he said my numbers were good (?). He also had me come in once a week for non-stress testing and a few extra ultrasounds to see how big he was getting. I was induced at 39 weeks as he was measuring about 8 pounds, he was born a healthy 7lbs. 14 oz.Now this is the strange part, I am not sure about the one hour test but I know the three hour test should be a fasting test and I didn't fast for it and I tried repeatedly to tell all three docotors that (family, OB and endo) but they wouldn't do the test over simply because I had a family history. Now my sister had it with one and not the other and now here I am I had it (supposedly) with my son and yet with the twins I don't so make sure you follow the instructions for testing and if they don't say anything about fasting make sure you ask because I never did and they never said anything!!",
