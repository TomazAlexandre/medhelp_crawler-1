Is there any history of diabetes or sugar problems?Is she currently following a suggested diet for gastroparesis? And cutting way, way, way back on fats?",

    "question": "My wife has been suffering with excess saliva for 3 years and needs help. Her symptoms are: around 10am each day excess salvia begins - just pooring out - which she is required to swallow continuously. Around 2-3pm she begins to become nausious. Gets so bad she has to go to bed and drug herself to sleep around 7 or 8 pm. Upon waking she is fine. Next day starts all over again. She has been test neurologically with negative results, gastro doc says it comes from stomach and has diagnosed gastroparesis without any successful treatment. ENT says has heard of it (water brash) but knows of no treatment. She had dental surgery about the time this started - a scrapping of the gums - but oral surgeon says its not related. Retired ENT says it is Pytalism.Current ENT has never heard of it. She takes multiple mental health-type drugs for depression and anxiety - which allow her to sleep. Her psychiatrist says drugs cannot be problem. Anyone have any idea that we haven't thought of? Any help would be appreciated.",
