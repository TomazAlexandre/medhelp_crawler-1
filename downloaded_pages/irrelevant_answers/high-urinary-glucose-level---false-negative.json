            "answer": "Hi, thanks for the reply. I did have something sugary about 2 hours before I had my urine tested, a can of soda. I never drink soda though, and don't usually have much sugar, but had some this morning because the clinic recommended intaking sugar before donating so you don't feel week from the temporary loss of blood.But even though I had sugar close to the time I was tested, shouldn't that sugar remain in my blood and not be found in my urine? It was only 12 oz. of soda...that wouldn't cause my blood sugar to rise so high that glucose would make it's way into my urine, would it?The nurse that tested me said the soda MIGHT be the cause of the test results, but she doesn't think so. Normal urine is supposed to contain absolutely no glucose, and I had a significant level in mine, not enough to overload my blood causing some glucose to find its way to my urine.I've set up an appointment to get an HbA1c test, but I wanted to find out other people's opinions until I take the test and get the results, because I'd like to ease my mind before then if possible.",

    "question": "I recently tried to donate plasma but was rejected because my urine test showed that I had glucose in my urine (250g). I was told there isn't supposed to be any.Diabetes doesn't run in my family, and my blood and urine tests in the past have never been out of the ordinary.Currently I am taking Methylin for ADD, allergy medicine (containing loratadine and pseudoephedrine sulfate), and Robitussin for a cough (containing dextromethorphan).Could any of these medications have raised my blood sugar to the point where it began to be sercreted into my urine?I'd appreciate any thoughts/comments, thanks.Aaron",
