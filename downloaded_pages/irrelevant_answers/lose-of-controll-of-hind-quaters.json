            "answer": "Hi, your child is soooo young to be dealing with this!\u00a0\u00a0I also know, by too much experience, how frustrating and upsetting it is to take kitty to a bunch of different vets with no answers.Well, I've got a few ideas for you to think about AND a couple of questions.\u00a0\u00a0First some questions.1.\u00a0\u00a0What all has kitty been tested for?\u00a0\u00a0Please tell me everything that has been done.\u00a0\u00a0This will also help the other members on here make some more suggestions.2.\u00a0\u00a0Is kitty indoor or outdoor or both?Okay, some of my ideas.....I'm thinking of a possible lower spine disk problem.\u00a0\u00a0And, my other thought is a possible heart problem.\u00a0\u00a0There is a heart condition that kitties can get, even young kitties, called cardiomyopathy.\u00a0\u00a0This causes blood clots to enter the blood stream and cause blockages in the vessels leading to the lower legs causing this weakness.\u00a0\u00a0I pray that it's not the cause of your kitty's problems.\u00a0\u00a0An echocardiogram will give you this information.\u00a0\u00a0I would ask the vet about this possibility.My fingers are crossed that you and your kitty get the information that you both deserve.ZQ",

            "answer": "Hello,First, I'm so sorry for your kitty and the stress this must be causing your family.\u00a0\u00a0Have you googled this problem?\u00a0\u00a0I went ahead and did that and came up with several suggestions of how this could happen.\u00a0\u00a0This happened to my own cat...she was 3 and we never knew why she ended up that way or the cause because after $2500 and no answers, we had to put her down.Some problems I've read are (and I'm sure this is only a few)Blood ClotDiabetic Neuropathy (has she been tested for diabetes?)Pinched vertebral disc that is bulging upward and compressing the spine.Strangely, but there is a cat in my neighborhood who walks around like you describe...like the rear doesn't cooperate with the front.Best of luck and I hope you get some answers soon.",
