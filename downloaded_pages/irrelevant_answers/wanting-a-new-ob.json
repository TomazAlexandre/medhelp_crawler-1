Then another time she said I was going to get blood drawn and never came back into the room nor did the nurse. She always does every thing late with me. Most you ladys already have your glucose test done. Mine won't do it till 28 weeks ansd I'm 25 now. So many of you ladys new the gender 3 weeks before I did and we were the same weeks along. It ***** waiting so long.",
