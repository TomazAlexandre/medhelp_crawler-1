They attributed it to a heart med I was taking-Losartan. A follow up, including a 24 hour urine collectin showed my kidneys are ok. The cyst, although large, is superficial.Anyway, the nephrologist told me I'm ok, and not to worry.",

    "question": "My pain is random, intermittent, and infrequent. I'm 68 years old, and this has been going on for many years.The pain can appear anywhere-top of head(skull or hair area), anywhere in the thorax, abdomen, arms, groin.When it appears, it stays there-in that spot. I can ignore it, and, hours later, it will go away.It can stab me several times per minute, or once every few minutes. It is independent of activity or touch, usually.In other words, I cannot precipitate it by touching the spot where it happens to appear.Sometimes, it is so intense, that I physically recoil, or flinch from the stab. I can make it stop by taking ibuprofen.If it isn't too intense, I usually just tolerate it, and it eventually goes away on its own. If it is too bothersome, I take 400mg of ibuprofen, and that usually stops it. As I said, when it appears in a spot, it stays there. Weeks or months later, when it reappears, it may be a different spot, but then that is where it stay until it goes away by itself or with drug help.It is superficial. My doc calls it myofacial(myofascial?) pain. In other words, I'm pretty sure it is not internal organ related.Anyone out there have a similar pain? If so, please let me know if you've come up with a solution or cure. Thanks.",
