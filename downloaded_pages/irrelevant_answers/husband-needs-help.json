            "answer": "I was just wondering if you bought him orowheat high fiber toast, and when he eats carbs he needs to eat a protien , like a egg, to help control his BS. The high starch diet is the cause of BS going out of control also, Have him eat high grain, and fruits should be the lower sugar ones, pears, strawberrys and raspberry and blueberrys. The fact with diabetes is the diet is a big cause of out of control diabetes. And not eating make the liver produce excess glucose. He should be eating snacks that are low carb, nuts or cheese, or celery and cream cheese. Chips sweets and hihg starch can cause high BS numbers. I hope he start feeling better, get that thyroid function balanced and he will. Blessing to u both, Debbie",
