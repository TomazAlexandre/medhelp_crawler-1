            "answer": "Square one is to identify the etiology of the \"stroke\". A stroke can be due to (a) a clot or thrombisis or (b) a bleed. Often the first stroke is due to a clot secondary to simple dehydration, the patient is placed on Coumadin, and the second stroke is due to a bleed from the medication.With the MRI/MRA the specific kind of stroke can be identified.Square two is to insure the situation is stabilized. Easier said than done. In many cases this means simply paying attention to hydration. Uncontrolled diabetes can cause microangiopathy and macroangiopathy, essentially narrowing the diameter of essential blood passageways. If diabetes is present meticulous control of blood glucose is a must. Medications that interfere with clotting such as Coumadin are commonly prescribed, however there are arguements that a lesser degree of control, such as that provided by aspirin alone, may represent a superior risk benefit. The U.S. database \"Pubmed\" has studies comparing and contrasting outcomes with various protocols.When there is a \"stroke\" portions of the brain may be damaged, generally becaused they are deprived of oxygenation, but ocasionally because they are deprived of nutrients. Although there is redundancy, some of the damage may not repair itself. Contrary to popular believe human beings do develop and grow new brain cells as adults.Dementia also goes with the package, due primarily to degradation of the microcirculation. There are more varieties of dementia that Alzheimer's. Sometimes Omega-3 fish oils, slow-release niacin, blueberry and pomegranate will help in restoring function.Love, care, attention, mental stimulation, and specifically physical contact are of great benefit. Physical contact means staying with the patient and always holding a hand, wrist or placing a hand on his/her shoulder.Daily exposure to sunlight and maintaining vitamin D3 levels is also essential.",

            "answer": "Hello Patrick,Welcome to the Senior Health Forum. Please excuse my tardy response. Caregiver has provided you with some great information.I would just like to add that you may want to take a look at the medications she is being prescribed. Seniors, especially frail or compromised seniors sometimes respond just the opposite to medications as expected. In my many years of working with seniors I have seen medication due horrid things to memory and stamina. It often takes a wise, skilled and experienced gerontologist to sort through these issues.As we age our systems often become just as fragile as babies. So much care is needed in prescribing meds.Due to her history of CVAs this could be a related dementia as Caregiver suggested. When night approaches Dementia patients often experience what is commonly know as Sun-Downers. Meaning in part when the sun goes down these symptoms of confusion and disorientation exhibit more strongly. There are many theories as to why this occurs but they are all that, theories.If it were my mom I would make sure her oxygen saturation (O2 SATS) rates are not falling in the evening. This could also account for some of her symptoms. Our brain requires good oxygenation. I would also want all her electrolyte, including vitamin and mineral levels checked.Her symptoms could be from a combination of factors, including meds and dementia. As Caregiver said, your Mom requires lots of love, one on one care, understanding, close supervision and attention.I wish you both the very best. She is fortunate to have your love and concern. So many seniors don't have that. Please keep in touch and let us know how your mom is progressing.My Best,~Tuck",
