            "answer": "Kellogg's cereal does have a ton of carbs in it, which makes me cringe seeing the adverts regarding the alleged \"healthy\" qualities.\u00a0\u00a0One needs to be careful with front of the box disclaimers, and instead one must read the nutritional info and ingredients at the back of the box.Another thing to consider is what happens when the body receives a whopping amount of carbs or protein without fat.\u00a0\u00a0Did you know that protein is insulinogenic?\u00a0\u00a0This means if you eat a ultra rich protein meal without fat and little carbs, the body can respond by injecting insulin into blood, driving the blood sugar super low, and then this is followed by your body converting some of the protein to glucose, via a process called gluconeogenesis.\u00a0\u00a0Kind of a bummer if someone goes intentionally low carb to control their blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Better to have a low carb, moderate protein and high fat meal (like non starchy veg saut\u00e9ed in butter with steak), as this fills you up cancelling hunger quickly, while delivering great nutrition without blood sugar spikes.",

            "answer": "Well since your A1C is going up, you should be cautious and get a OGTT - Oral Glucose Tolerance Test.\u00a0\u00a0And since you've noticed a change in how your body handles glucose.If you haven't done it, yet, you want a 4 hr test measuring both the glucose and the insulin.\u00a0\u00a0 You want a 5 point test: fasting, 1/2 hr, 1hr, 2hr, 3hr, and 4hr.Many doctors still don't realize the importance of tracking insulin during this test.\u00a0\u00a0Once it was explained to me, I realize how dumb it is not to do this.In the future it doesn't have to be this long or involved, but as a base line it's good to have all the data.Based on this a \"good\" doctor should be able to advise you.The good news right now is that you have good control of your glucose -- based on your A1C.Be well",

            "answer": "The first four ingredients of Special K protein cereal are Whole grain wheat, wheat gluten, sugar and rice.\u00a0\u00a0For one serving, there are 19 grams carbo, including 7 grams sugar. Yikes!! Even a slice of bread typically has same amount of carbo and much less sugar.\u00a0\u00a0From what I see, Special K protein cereal is kryptonite...my recommendation is to not ingest it.\u00a0\u00a0It will spike your blood sugar and make your diabetes worse.\u00a0\u00a0There are Much healthier alternatives for breakfast, and they typically involve non-processed food with fewer ingredients and resemble the shape they came from mother nature.

            "answer": "Good question, shaunw84.What makes you miss the cereal?\u00a0\u00a0Is it the crunch?\u00a0\u00a0Is it the sweetness?\u00a0\u00a0Is it the soggy stuff after absorbing the milk?There is research showing how sugar triggers area of the brain similar to other addictive substances like cocaine.\u00a0\u00a0If your brain is doing this, then I'm not sure if there is something you can take to reduce the addiction.\u00a0\u00a0But, if you are craving the crunch, sweet, or milky sponginess, then yes there is something you can do to substitute for this.For crunch, try crushed nuts, sunflower seeds and pumpkin seeds sprinkled over full fat yogurt or full fat kefir or ricotta.If you crave the sweet, try the combination listed about with addition if a few berries.If you crave the moist spongy mouthfeel of milk-absorbed cereal, then you can substitute this with a quick 2-minute almond cake.\u00a0\u00a0Simple recipe:\u00a0\u00a0beat one egg with three tablespoons of almond flour and quarter teaspoon of baking powder.\u00a0\u00a0Add any flavouring if your choice (like vanilla extract, or cocoa powder or almond extract or grated lemon rind or a few berries).\u00a0\u00a0Add teaspoon or two of stevia sweetener, if desired. Then pour batter in buttered coffee mug or cereal bowl, and microwave for 90 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0Remove from microwave, and eat immediately, and if desired add milk, or cream or yogurt on top if your cake.\u00a0\u00a0Really delicious and so fast to prepare. enjoy!! :-)",

    "question": "Five years ago, I was given a Glucose meter and checked my levels. They were perfect. Fasting was around 80.\u00a0\u00a0After a meal, maybe 120. So no worries. Then a couple of years ago, I got out the meter and ordered some strips. Tested Glucose and fasting ranged from 88 to 100. I ate a big old bowl of chocolate ice cream and chocolate sauce after dinner one night and after one hour, checked glucose and it was at 155! Went to Doctor and he checked my A1C and it was 4.9. He said that was fine. A years later, A1C was 5.1. Now my A1C is 5.3.\u00a0\u00a0If I abuse myself, such as eat something high carb, my glucose goes high. The highest I've ever made it go is 171. That was done by drinking a 20 ounce Coke quickly. So, I'm in my late 50's, 5' 6\" tall, spend 4 nights a week at the Gym and have been doing so for the past 13 years. I walk every day at lunch. My weight bounces between 146 and 150 pounds so not really fat. My Doctor ran a really expensive test I had to pay for that checked for insulin resistance - I'm not sure what the test\u00a0\u00a0was called?\u00a0\u00a0I can find out if anyone wants to know? Anyway, the test showed at least at this time, I am not insulin resistant.\u00a0\u00a0So at this time I am trying to eat better.\u00a0\u00a0What is odd is we ordered a Pizza the other night and I had 3 pieces. After 2 hours, my glucose was 117.\u00a0\u00a0Yet , a bowl of Special \"K\" protein cereal will shoot me to 150 so I don't get it. Am I pre-diabetic or diabetic or what.\u00a0\u00a0The only diabetes in our family is on my Mom's side. Her Sister's Daughter got type one at 6 years old. Very serious condition.",
