            "answer": "Hi,How are you?Panic attacks can be triggered by a generalized anxiety disorder, low blood sugar levels, thyroid dysfunction, excess caffeine intake, hyperventilation and certain medications.Tingling numbness can be due to anxiety, or peripheral neuropathy like diabetes and B12 deficiency.Please do some breathing exercises, maintain your fluid intake and blood sugar levels. Make aure you sleep for at least 8 hrs every day.It is possible that the polyp may have grown back, only an X ray or CT scan will be able to diagnose it.Hope this helps!",

It does put me at ease.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is diabetic so I have checked my blood sugar levels and I am normal there.\u00a0\u00a0I'll look into some of the other causes and see if any them make sense.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had my thyroid checked, and I will look into B12 deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0I sleep at 8 hours a day and I am overall pretty healthy and I like to exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I'll work hard to beat this disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you again.",

    "question": "I recently had a panic attack, which I have never had before.\u00a0\u00a0During the onset, the left side of my face was tingling and it felt like the left side of my lips were growing huge, but of course they did not.\u00a0\u00a0This was such a strange feeling and I had no idea that I was just about to have a full blown panic attack.\u00a0\u00a0I read about anxiety and I seem to understand a little bit more about it.\u00a0\u00a0But lately the tingling and numbness is staying with me throughout the day.\u00a0\u00a0It's not intense like when I had the panic attack, but since it is only on one side of my face I am starting to think that there could be more behind it.\u00a0\u00a0I had a polyp removed from my left cheek bone about two years ago and I am also wondering if it could have grown back and is resting on the nerve.\u00a0\u00a0My last sympton is I am driving in the car and I get faint, that's what I think brought on the anxiety because I worry about passing out.\u00a0\u00a0The faint feeling is happening more often now.\u00a0\u00a0Any thought if these sympton are Neuro rather than just Anxiety?\u00a0\u00a0I am normally a strong person and I feel helpless with this.Thank you.",
