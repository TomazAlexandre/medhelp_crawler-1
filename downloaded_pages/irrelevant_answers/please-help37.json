            "answer": "You don't need to be fasting for Thyroid bloodwork.I asked my GP about the best time to have blood taken. He said it didn't really matter, although first thing in the morning may show levels a little lower.Two years ago your TSH was .9, which is supposed to be perfect. It may have changed since then.Ask for a test of TSH, free T3, free T4, and antibodies. With those numbers to look at a good GP can tell you if you have a thyroid problem or not.If your neck glands are swolen, maybe an ultrasound of your glands would be helpful.",

            "answer": "Has anyone ever worked you up for polycystic ovarian syndrome?\u00a0\u00a0(pcos).\u00a0\u00a0It can often be hard to diagnose but it could be the cause for the fertility problems.\u00a0\u00a0To me it sounds like many of your issues could be autoimmune related - hashi or grave's (thyroid), pcos (reproductive), Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (tiredness), fibromyalgia (cramping assuming you mean muscles & joints), Irritable Bowel Disorders (digestive) and a multitude of skin-related ones.\u00a0\u00a0If you have 1 autoimmune disorder you're at higher risk of getting more.\u00a0\u00a0If you aren't already seening an endocrinologist I would suggest you see one and especially one that specialized in thyroid care and not diabetes care.\u00a0\u00a0They would also be able to check you for any adrenal problems, too.\u00a0\u00a0The other potential issues could be looked at by a rheumatologist and a GI for the GI symptoms.Like Dac said, please let us know what happens and feel free to ask any questions you have.\u00a0\u00a0Welcome to the board.Rayne",
