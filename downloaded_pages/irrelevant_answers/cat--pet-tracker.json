            "answer": "Savas,For illnesses we'd have to choose the ones users have been posting about a lot, like feline leukemia, diabetes, and UTI...UTI being the most frequent because....who hasn't encountered \"little\" accidents in the kitchen, bed or brand new couch which you haven't even finished paying for (my case sadly)? Remember, even though UTI can be treated, a lot of cats will get UTI for a second and third time so.I can't think of any tests or medication; but I guess it'd be good to add those related to the illnesses I mentioned above.What do you and the rest of the community think?",

            "answer": "From what I've seen the other human trackers help you keep track of various elevations (like white blood cell count, etc...) if anyone has any specific tests they do for their cat with the vet, that would be a good thing to suggest.\u00a0\u00a0 I've dealt mostly with spot on emergency vet care (for some reason my own cats are disgustingly healthy, go figure) for the strays that come and go so I'm not really used to thinking in terms of long term care.UTI management is a good one. Probably it will tie in to those with cats that have repeated outbreaks of crystals. Anyone got any thoughts on the others?",

    "question": "We're in the process of trying to come up with a pet tracker. I'm suggesting two to start; one to track a pet's general overall health, a second would be more specific, dealing with medication amounts and tracking test results. For the second especially, I'm asking if y'all have any thoughts or opinions on what illnesses, tests, and medications you'd like to see placed on a tracker (For example, the dog forum is planning a tracker for wormer and distemper schedules, which is an excellent idea).Are there any specific illnesses (cat oriented, all though other suggestions would be welcome) out there anyone one would find this useful for?",
