            "answer": "Hi KaySounds sort of like what I was told in July except that I have stage 4 cirrhosis with the steatohepatitis. The doc seems quite unconcerned at this time but strongly encouraged me to live a very 'clean' life...lots of exercise, good diet, no stress, lots of rest, no alcohol (I never drank anyway) & lots of prayer. All of this would prolong it's advancement but there's nothing to actually stop it. I don't even qualify for a liver transplant until my liver actually 'fails' so that's really something to look forward to...NOT.Tell him to keep his chin up & live 'clean'.\u00a0\u00a0Take care. I'll pray for you both.Chevy1",

No more of the foods he loves and I keep the old whip ready but seriously, this has scared himSo you have right side pain? fatigue? These are the only symptoms other than itching he has and that can be an early or late symptom.Lets keep in touchShannon",
