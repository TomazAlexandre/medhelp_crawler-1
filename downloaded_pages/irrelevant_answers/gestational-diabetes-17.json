            "answer": "Just watch what you eat. Keep your carbs and sugar intake low. The worst they do is stick you on insulin. Its really not that bad. Just remember 3 meals a day under 60 carbs and 3 snacks with 15 carbs. Cream cheese and pickles are a free food, I add them to almost everything. Popcorn is also awesome. You can eat a ton and stay in your carb range for snacks. I had gestational with my 3rd. Unfortunately mine turned into type 2 after I had her. I dont have to have insulin this pregnancy now because I follow my carb restrictions and drink lots of water.",
