Gestational diabetes is something that women sometimes have that they don't notice any symptoms, but it can have a very bad effect on the baby if it's not treated. If you don't even know you have it, that's dangerous, particularly for the baby.",

            "answer": "I just did the 3 hour test yesterday and it wasn't that bad. Yes I had to sit there for 3 hours and wait around to get poked, but I rather be on the safe side. I felt sick the whole day yesterday, but there's nothing worse than having a sick baby because I didn't get checked out. I rather find out so it can get treated. I know my mom had it (I don't want to scare you) and her doctor never had it check so when she went into labor she got really sick. My sister was fine, but my mom ended up getting organ failure. She got really swollen and couldn't even open her eyes. Another doctor later told her she had gestational diabetes and eclampsia and that why she never took care of it, but she never knew she had it. She ended up staying at the hospital for over 2 weeks. They had to do blood transfusion and doctors literally thought she wasn't going to make it. Thankfully she is here with us today and doing good!! :)",
