            "answer": "PCOS increases your risks of miscarrying because your ovaries do not always produce a viable egg. But it is possible to have a normal pregnancy with PCOS. I have PCOS and I took progesterone my last pregnancy and did not see a specialist. My daughter turned 1-year-old last month.Progesterone is about the only thing you can do unless you have a blood clotting disorder (if you do then you'll need to take a baby aspirin daily). Progesterone is produced by the corpus luteum cyst in early pregnancy and then the placenta takes over the production of this important hormone. Progesterone signals to your body that you are pregnant and to not menstruate (or abort the baby). If your pregnancy is not viable, however, Progesterone won't matter in the end but at least you're taking it now to buy time until you can get a sonogram to see what is going on in your womb.Congrats!",
