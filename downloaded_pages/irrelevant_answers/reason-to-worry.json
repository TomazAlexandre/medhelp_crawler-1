            "answer": "I agree with utahmomma.It is best to get the TSH lower- nearer a 1- before you begin a family. The TSH is suggestive of hypothyroidism. I would suggest a repeat TSH to insure that it isn't a transient finding.Then get to an endo for treatment. Some symptoms of hypo are fatigue, mood issues, sleep trouble, memory problems and many more. Hypothyroidism can also put you at risk for heart disease. That's not to scare you. If you get treatment, you should do fine.",

For experts out there, pls advise if this is a reason to worry.TSH: 8.98 uIU/mL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Normal: 0.35-5.50T4: 8.1ug/dL\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Normal: 4.5-12.0T3 Uptake: 31%\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Normal: 24-39My physician advised that I go for an Antibodies test. The results are as:Anti- Thyroglobulin (T/Tg) Ab\u00a0\u00a0 63.0 IU/ml\u00a0\u00a0 Value>34: PositiveAnti-Microsomal(M/TPO) Ab\u00a0\u00a0 2.3 IU/ml\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Value> 12: PositiveMy doctor has advised against taking any medication until we plan a family. I just wanted to take your (anyone with similar trends) opinion. Furthermore, my research shows that taking the thyroid supplement for life is the only solution. Is there anything else which can be done? What are the side-effects from hypo-thyroidism?",
