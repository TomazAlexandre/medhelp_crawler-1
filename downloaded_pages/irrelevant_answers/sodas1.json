            "answer": "I'm sorry to add to the reasons not to like Dr. Pepper, my favorite soda, but the high-fructose corn syrup is bad for your liver, and taking in a lot of sweet stuff during pregnancy has been implicated in the child later getting diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Please cut the D.P. in half with sparkling water, at the very least.\u00a0\u00a0And if you can, try to train yourself off it by drinking one of the so-called natural sodas like Hansen's for a while as you wean from the Dr. P. (they have a cola that you can kid yourself is a substitute) and also cutting it likewise in half with plain sparkling water.\u00a0\u00a0The natural sodas at least don't have the high-fructose corn syrup.You REALLY don't want to wind up with a child with diabetes and to wonder if it was because of what you ate and drank when they were in the womb.Good luck!!!",
