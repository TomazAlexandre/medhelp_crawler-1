    "question": "Hi, gals!!! I was just wondering if anyone else has experienced their premie baby changing his or her own eating and sleeping habits? He started out by sleeping longer in between meals. And then he increased his intake a few days later. He was eating 3 to 3 1/2 oz. every 3 to 4 hours. Now, he's eating 4 to 4 1/2 ounces or more every 4 to 6 hours. He was born on Jan. 31st. Is it time for him to sleep longer between meals already? I guess I let his little body decide, or should I call a nurse helpline? Just wondering.I guess maybe no worries since he also increased his intake??? Thanks, ladies!!!",
