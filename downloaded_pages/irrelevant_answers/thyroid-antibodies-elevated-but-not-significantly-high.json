            "answer": "Sorry...the coffee hasn't kicked in yet!I should also mention that TPOab can be slightly elevated with other autoimmune conditions, e.g. lupus, RA, etc. Autoimmune disease seems to run in families, but it's not always the SAME autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0For example, one member of the family might have Hashi's, another lupus, another type I diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0However, your family does seem to have gotten very \"lucky\" with the Hashi's!",

I am just so tired of hearing it's in my head!I was tested for RA and that was neg and I feel like I have seen so many doctors for this, from ENT, Neuro because they thought it could be MS, regular GP, Gastro... I mean I've been around the block so I feel like if I had another disorder they would have found it by now...Who knows anymore...Thank you for helping!",

    "question": "Hi...If antibodies are present does it really matter if they are high or low?I was tested in December of 2010 and had none and then again a year later in January 2012 where I had them...ATA - 46 (0-30)TPO - 69 (25-60)My TSH is 3.93 (.36 - 5.04)My FT4 is .8 (0.8 - 1.8)I wasn't tested this time for T3 or Free T3 because endo said it wasn't necessary but the last T3 I had was 201 & was elevated but I don't have the range for it...Thanks!",
