            "answer": "Hello,This feeling of needle ***** sensations and numbness that you are having are called Paresthesia. Chronic paresthesia indicates a problem with the functioning of neurons.Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol?Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries. Kind regards.",

            "answer": "about 2 years ago my feet did this. I would actually fall down from the pain. My Primary had no clue and sent me to a neurologist, whom stuck me\u00a0\u00a0with needles in my legs and feet to check for nerve damage (that test was fine. then a podiatist whom told me it was probually from me having a high arch and sent me home with custom inserts for my shoes. then time went on a my PD left and I got put with an internalist,I went in one day in locked up pain throughout my body, she sent me to an RA and together they diagnosed me with fibromyalgia. For me this how it all start...the pins and needles in my feet. Please keep a clsoe on eye on any other signal your body is giving you. plese keep me updated on anything you find out, I know how it feels and sorry it is happening to you. oh and try and stretch your legs when before you stand up, I think it promotes blood flow or something, whatever it does , it could help prevent a fall. Best of luck to you.",
