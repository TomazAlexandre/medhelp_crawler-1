            "answer": "I am a teacher and a diabetic for 27 years.\u00a0\u00a0So, I am shocked by the behavior of that teacher.\u00a0\u00a0As a teacher I would never lay a hand on a child! Thank goodness the next teacher was able to help you.You can get your son on a 504 plan.\u00a0\u00a0It is a plan to help children who are in need of some special assistance, but is not like an IEP, individual education plan.\u00a0\u00a0http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/504/, this website might help you to understand what a 504 plan is and how to implement.\u00a0\u00a0Also, please visit www.JDRF.org.\u00a0\u00a0This is the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation website and will also help you get in touch with the chapter near you.\u00a0\u00a0They will offer you support and help you with problems you are encountering in your child's school and help you to understand what Type I diabetes is all about.Remember you are your child's advocate, so do not back down when it comes to your child's school.\u00a0\u00a0As a parent of a child you are actually who the teachers and board of education are working for.\u00a0\u00a0My suggestion is to go to the superintendent of the schools and explain what has happened to your child.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that the principal was probably trying to protect his employee, but if a person resorts to spanking and embarrassing a child in front of his peers I question their ability as a teacher.\u00a0\u00a0 I think it is a very good idea that your having a meeting with all the people who will be involved in your child's school day.\u00a0\u00a0Please make sure they all know what information you have from your child's doctor.\u00a0\u00a0 I suggest you take written documentation from your child's doctor to show the diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I am still finding it hard to believe that people would question his diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I am a teacher because I care about children and their well being.\u00a0\u00a0Your best bet is to be very informed about your child and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Find out as much as you can and make your presence know at your child's school.",

            "answer": "First I don't understand two things. Isn't it against the law to spank a child, a teacher!? My nephew a few weeks ago got slaped in the face from a lunch aide. She got arrested and sent to jail for 2 days. It is going to the High court of California and she may see prision time for child abuse. It sounds strange that u didn't press charges or call the police. The second is the diagnoses of type 1 for your son? In six month he may need Insulin? Someone help me with this? I never new a dr could see type 1 coming on so far ahead. I haven't ever heard this.",

            "answer": "In response to strawberri: lab tests from blood drawn can show whether there are antibodies present that are currently attacking the pancreas to destroy it. Yes, that test DOES show if the pancreas is being attacked to produce full-blown diabetes in coming months. Nobody can say for sure how long it takes, for the timing is different in different people, but the test exists and is commonly used by doctors. High blood sugar levels or even hypoglycemia if his pancreas is overproducing insulin at times (which is common before kids become diabetics) would very likely cause behavior problems in a child. Many moms tell us their kids are irritable when glucose levels are off-kilter, and you are very fortunate that the second teacher was observant enough to figure out that a medical reason for behavior problems was the issue.",

    "question": "My 5 year old son received the diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes this week.\u00a0\u00a0We have had alot of problems with the school since the first week of school.\u00a0\u00a0His first teacher tried to label him with a diagnosis of ODD 5 days into school.\u00a0\u00a0We requested written behavior reports over and over to estabish a pattern and never received one.\u00a0\u00a0 Over the course of three weeks things esculated to the point she spanked him in front of the class.\u00a0\u00a0We had to pull him from school to be granted a classroom change because the principal and counselor did not want to beleive us when we told them he did not behave like that at home and were refusing to change is class.\u00a0\u00a0The teacher even admitted to a dislike to our son.\u00a0\u00a0The new teacher had him in her class two days and informed us he did not have a behavior problem but she was worried about a health issuse.\u00a0\u00a0Over the next few weeks she observed him and sent home daily observations.\u00a0\u00a0The increase in urination, thirst and hunger became very apparent over the next month.\u00a0\u00a0We initiated a medical work up and have been told by the doctor he has very early Type 1 and will probably be ready to start insulin some time over the next 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0Our question is how do we protect our son from teachers like the first one.\u00a0\u00a0Some of the teachers and adminstration are still questioning his diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0We have requested a meeting with his teacher, principal, counselors, and support staff after the Thanksgiving break.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions would be helpful.",
