            "answer": "I was told not to eat or drink anything but water two hours prior. That was one of my concerns because I've heard some doctors do have you fast starting at midnight. (Kinda like they'd have you do for surgery) with my appointment at 1:30pm, I cant go that long without eating or it makes me feel really sick. Thankfully he didnt have me do that though",
