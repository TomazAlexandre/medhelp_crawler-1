I'm sure there's more pressure on your weight because of the gestational diabetes, just do what you can, eat healthy, and exercise when you can, and you're doing all you can, you'll have a healthy baby! A lot of women get gestational diabetes, and don't develop diabetes after, so I wouldn't stress over it! My OB with my son made me feel terrible about my weight gain, some doctors stress it more than others!",

My obgyn hasnt said anything negative about my weight gain as ling as I eat healthy foods, take my vitamins, and drink all my water. I am 26+4 and have gained 25 lbs. But my bp is perfect and I havent had a past of diabetes or probs with my bloodsugar.. I\u00a0\u00a0have my diabetes test coming up tho so we will see. But I think as long as u eat healthy, vitamins, water and walk that you and baby should be ok.",
