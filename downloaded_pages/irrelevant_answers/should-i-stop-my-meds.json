            "answer": "I personally don't believe your medication is the problem - I suggest having more tests - not sure what symptoms you are experiencing or you age or background - but I suffer from high TSH and take meds for it - but I have a ton of other issues - I thought I didn't need the med once - started feeling so much worse when I stopped taking it - within 2 weeks I was happily taking it every morning again....",

    "question": "I've been thinking about stopping my meds. I currently take 125mcg Levo for Hashimoto's Thyroiditis.The reasons for this are:- I've been sweating a lot more which makes me think is a hyper symptom and I'm still not gaining weight despite a negative coeliac and diabetes test.- My family haven't fully accepted I am hypothyroid and expect me to have a cheery happy expression on my face and in my voice whenever I see or talk to them in spite of how poorly I feel.- My GP has said my TSH is high at 4.6 (0.27-4.2) but my FT4 has moved up and is in range at 15.6 (12-22), so wouldn't that mean my thyroid is working?- Would naturapathic therapy clash with the meds?Is stopping my meds going to be a bad idea and is it going to be tough restarting them? I feel like I'm living a lie with this illness.ThanksJo xxx",
