            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The symptoms that you have described could certainly be related to diabetes. I recommend that you speak with your doctor about testing for diabetes. One of the tests I would recommend is a\u00a0\u00a0Hemoglobin A1c which can reveal a history of elevated blood sugar. The difference between type 1 and type 2 essentially is in management. Typically type 2 diabetes has adult onset. It can often be managed through diet and lifestyle modification, with/or without the use of oral diabetes medication. Type 1 used to be called Juvenile Diabetes. This was the diabetes most frequently noted in children. This diabetes is managed by diet/lifestyle changes and the injection of insulin.I hope this helps.Cathy",

    "question": "Hello Everyone:I'm a 48 year old man. Constantly thirsty. Constantly going to the bathroom.. every 15-20 minutes at times. I crave things like soda and sweets..but over the last few days I've lost my appetite--I think because of some issues I'm dealing with right now.My vision at times becomes blurred and shaky and that's weird because one night I was at home and just getting ready to have dinner and I had to hold on to the table as I was standing in the kitchen.I don't sleep well to begin with..I wake up at 5 am and fall asleep a little later in the morning. Feel tired all the time.I did a glucose test this morning after a few sips of coffee and the reading was 146.Yesterday morning .. after a few sips of coffee --reading was 157.Yesterday after I fell asleep for a bit.. (More than 3 hours) I did a test and it was 101. ( No food or anything to drink)If I am a diabetic what is the difference between type 1 and type 2?If anyone has any info that they can share I would appreciate it.",
