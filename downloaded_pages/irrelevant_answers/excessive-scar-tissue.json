            "answer": "OK then.\u00a0\u00a0This kind of scar tissue from a bad retinal detachment is called PVR (proliferative vitreoretinopathy).\u00a0\u00a0It is very difficult to control or slow down and there is no obvious medication that has helped much.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately surgery is the only way to try and deal with it if it is causing traction and more tears and detachments etc.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, oil frequently becomes necessary to keep the retina attached.HV",
