    "question": "I went in for my GTT (testing for diabetes) on December 23rd and only lasted the first hour and a half before I finally threw up. I get so sick when I dont eat...which you can't before and during the testing. Anyway, since I threw up they cancelled my lab and I scheduled to redo it...which was for this morning. I didn't eat after midnight and woke up feeling sick this morning...had ten minutes until my first blood draw and threw up!!!:(Just curious what will happen if I can't ever get this testing done without throwing up...anyone else have this problem?!",
