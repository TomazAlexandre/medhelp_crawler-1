    "question": "Hello,Info & HistoryI am a male, mid 20's 5'8 weigh 140-150 pounds.I have always been pretty athletic but do not have a great diet. A few years ago, maybe 2, I went to the doctor and was told I had sugar in my urine, after a blood test my blood sugar levels were normal.Here is my question:Once every few months I get moments of where I am tired, fidgety, anxious, frustrated and I do not feel good. Actually I had a moment just yesterday. I had breakfast around 10 a.m and also drank a lot of water and by 12:30 had these feelings. I then had a sucker because I maybe thought my sugar was low and after having the sucker (within minutes) I felt back to normal. Is this an indication of pre-diabetes or is this normal?",
