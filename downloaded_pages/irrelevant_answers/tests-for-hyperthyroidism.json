    "question": "Dr. Lupo,After showing symptoms of hyperthyroidism, my bloodwork showed a TSH level of .005. I saw an endocrinologist who recommended an I123 uptake and scan and further bloodwork, including anti-thyroglobulin. My T-3 and Free T-4 were in the normal range, but my TSH was .005 and the anti-thyroglobulin was 80. I then did the uptake, which was 23.8 and had a scan done with Technetium 99m, which showed an abnormality. I am waiting for ultrasound results now.I am concerned about the radiation I exposed myself to as a result of the testing. I received 100microcuries of I123 and 10 millicuries of technetium. I know that some hospitals use only I123 for both the uptake and scan. Was I exposed to more or less overall radiation by using the lower I123 dose and the technetium? Also, I was told that each was equivalent to less than one chest x-ray, but readings I have done on my own suggest otherwise. How much radiation results from such tests?Within the last few weeks, symptoms seem to be subsiding. Do you think that I did the uptake and scan too quickly? I had been having symptoms for over two months.Thank you.",
