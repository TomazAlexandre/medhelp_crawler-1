            "answer": "I am personally only familiar with cirrhosis caused by alcohol abuse, but there are obviously many other ways to achieve this diagnosis. Other than alcohol, Hep C, obesity and autoimmune disorders, I do not know. The folks here will chime in soon, I'm sure, so be patient. Have you ever had a Hep Screen? Many people don't even know they have it until a chance screening or symptoms arise. I've heard of heriditary factors being involved, too. At least you've learned not to drink yourself to this, so good job on that! Take care and check back soon.Nicole",

            "answer": "Helen,You need to get a Hep C antibody test to see if you have Hep C if you have not already done so. If you want to know how far your cirrhosis has progressed, you need to get a Fibrosure test. (Your liver enzyme scores are not a reliable indicator of the state of your liver.) You might also want to be tested for Autoimmune Hepatitis. I don't know what test they use to determine if you have Hep A and B, or, why you would have cirrhosis if you don't have hepatitis and don't drink, but there is a whole list of possibilities, including Diabetes, Wilson's Disease (hereditary: too much copper), various blood flow or bile duct obstructions and/or disturbances, hemochromatosis (iron overload) or enzyme deficiency. Hope this helps.Barbara",

    "question": "In my previous question, I asked the same question with no answers. I should have been more specific.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with stage 4 cirrhosis, and I am not a drinker. Nor have I ever been diagnosed with Hep.\u00a0\u00a0My father, brother, sister and several nephews had cirrhosis from alcaholism.\u00a0\u00a0My grandmother, another brother and sister had cirrhosis from medications due to heart conditions.\u00a0\u00a0What could be causing me to have this?\u00a0\u00a0I don't take meds. very often, and I eat a lot of fresh fruits and vegs.\u00a0\u00a0I'm very confused and somewhat scared after seeing what my family went through. Any comments would be helpful, thank you.",
