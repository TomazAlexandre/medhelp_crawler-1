            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you can do is take a combination of drugs to reduce the acid and lifestyle changes. You will need to take a combination of medications like a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole,\u00a0\u00a0lansoprazole or pantoprazole empty stomach in the morning and an antacid gel after meals for complete relief. Possibility of H pylori infection too should be looked into and a combination antibiotic tried.Life style changes that will help include: Avoid heavy meals and eat frequent small meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, smoking, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bed at least 2 hours after food. Maybe these tips will help you.Increase fiber and fluid in your diet and take multivitamin pill. See if this helps. If it does not you will need to consult a doctor.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I'm 28 years old, male, semi-active, former smoker, occasional drinker, 140lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I've had a heart murmur for as long as I can remember.Three and a half years ago I moved from Ohio to Texas.\u00a0\u00a0I started getting pains in my abdomen and chest.\u00a0\u00a0After seeing a doctor I was diagnosed with GERD.\u00a0\u00a0I've been on a drug called Ranitidine, which is a generic form of Xantac, on and off for a year or so.Lately I've been having many other symptoms including headache, dizziness, pain in the shoulders, arm numbness on the right side, morning nasuea, extreme anxiety, constipation with frequent gas, decreased appetite (under 1500 calories a day for over two years), uneasiness, and all my normal GERD symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Searching on the internet has led me to believe I have a multitude of conditions but I'm at a loss for the truth.\u00a0\u00a0I have no medical insurance and don't qualify for Medicaid. I'm afraid of going to the hospital for fear of credit-ruining bills I can't pay.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had any tests done but believe I need to be checked for diabetes, gallstones of gall bladder infections, stroke, silent heart attacks, anemia, and hypoglycemia.I go to bed every night wondering if I'll wake up.\u00a0\u00a0I don't truly believe I'm going to die in my sleep but the thought always crosses my mind.\u00a0\u00a0I spend a lot of my waking time worrying about my health and often cloister myself off from my friends.I KNOW that I need to see a doctor but frankly I'm terrified of finding out I have something serious and if I don't I'm terrified of the bills.\u00a0\u00a0SHOULD I DO?",
