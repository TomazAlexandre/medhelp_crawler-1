            "answer": "I'm FIXED! I had burning skin for three days.. Back legs, arms, face..itchy but more burning. Anything I ate would make it worse. I thought it was a shellfish allergy..nope.I realized I was B12 deficient from one of the posts on here. I got Sublingual B12 with folic acid. Took a shot of that under the tongue. Then bought Vitamin Shoppe's Soy Protein Shake (which also has 100% daily B complex vitamins, and many amino acids) and drank one cup with milk. Feel much better already and that was two hours ago I bought them both.Also bought a Cal-Mag-Zinc for later to take before sleep and will be munching on spinach later and making some guacamole to restore glutathione.I always change my diet, but I havent had much bread as I think I have an allergy to wheat. Forgot to keep taking B vitamins for missing vitamins.Good luck! There is always a cure! Just keep researching and trying different things. Stay hopeful.",
