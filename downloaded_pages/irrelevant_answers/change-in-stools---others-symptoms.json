            "answer": "About changes in stools, during the last 60 days a lot of things happened with my stools. First they were a bit more watery. Later more yellowish (no watery, 3 small pieces) and in the last days they are more normal (brown in colour but still a bit soft, 2 or 3 small pieces). They don\u00b4t smell foul and they aren\u00b4t high quantity of feces (maybe because my diet). In 3 or 4 times during the last 2 months they seemed fatty and ugly.The coincidence it started in the end of my trip.About bilirubin, just the direct bilirubin is 0.20! The indirect bilirubin is 1.1 so the total bilirubin is 1.3! What do you think? Considering Pancreas the important is direct bilirubin, right?I don\u2019t have diahrrea or constipation because I have bowel moviment 1 or 2 times a day. Is it possible in IBS or another bowel disfunction?What do I have to do? Just wait? My doctor prescribed me a probiotic and a medicine for IBS. And about my vagues pain in the back, coincidence? Anxiety?Thank you for the attention!",

    "question": "Hello! Male, 35 years old. Needing some advices. In january I spent 1 month working in another country (Oman, Middle East). One week before back to home I started to feel changes in stools. And at moment, two months later, the stools isn't normal yet. Sometimes they are loose, others normal and rarely watery. I have one or two (maximum) bowel moviments.Current symptoms: stools not normal as before my trip, vagues pains in abdominal and back (come and go). I am on a diet for one month and lost 10lbs (maybe too much but I am overweight, 1.90cm and 130kgs).I already performed 2 ultrasounds and 1 MRI of abdomen. Both of them were clean except for 2 gallstones (asymptomatic, I know I have them since 3 years ago).I went to 2 doctors. Both of them told me it should be IBS. They told me a trigger was my 1 month trip (very different foods for me, spicy foods, per example). But I don't have diahrreia or constipation. Just change in stools.1) With ultrasounds and MRI, can I rule out Pancreatic Cancer?2) My bloods test showed direct bilirubin on 0.20. Is it normal?3) My LDL cholesterol dropped 30% in one month! For me, too much! Just because the diet? Or malabsorption?4) Is it possible to be IBS or some other bowel disfunction?I am suffering a lot from anxiety!Thank you!",
