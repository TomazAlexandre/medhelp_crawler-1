If those levels are low, you need to increase your med and run tests on the pituitary gland.If your Free T4 and Free T3 are high, then you are hyper and your med dosage needs to be lowered.I'm not telling you what to do with your meds. I'm telling you what your doctor should be doing with your meds.",

Not sure if Im crazy about her, she also tells me I have diabetes because she had last two lab test from family Dr and my glucose level was 126, even after I told her those numbers weren't while fasting. I went to her for the thyroid and she quickly went onto the diabetes which makes no sense to me because the number was fine for not fasting.",
