Being induced is not bad.\u00a0\u00a0You'll go to the hospital and they'll check you in.\u00a0\u00a0You go to your delivering room and get comfy and then they will get things started.\u00a0\u00a0They'll start an IV of Pitocin and then most likely break your water soon after that (which does not hurt at all).\u00a0\u00a0Then you get cozy in your bed waiting for things to get going.\u00a0\u00a0Then once you are contracting to a point that it is fierce, they will offer you an epidural which I personally took.\u00a0\u00a0the Labor and Delivery nurses are pretty awesome at letting you know what is going on and they also check you frequently.\u00a0\u00a0They let you know when it is time to begin pushing and soon after, you'll hold your new baby.I'm wishing you the very best of luck and an easy labor/delivery hon.",

    "question": "So I'm 39 weeks and I'm getting induced tonight. Doctors water to induce me because I have gestational diabetes. I'm a bit nervous because I don't know what to expect. Currently I'm 1 cm dilated and they will do something tonight to soften the cervix ans give me induction medicine tomorrow morning.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a ftm. Any advice from ladies who experienced induction? :-)",
