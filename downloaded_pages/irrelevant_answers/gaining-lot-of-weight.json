            "answer": "If my math is correct 13 kgs is about 28 lbs. I have only gained 3lbs which is about 1kg and I am 20+4 my doctor isn't worried that I have barely gained weight but I wasn't the skinniest person I weighed 165lbs when I got pregnant and I am 5ft6in but my cousin gained 60lbs in her pregnancy and she was on a special balanced diet, some people are just different and when they get pregnant their bodies treat it differently by gaining more weight. Definitely do exercises but don't over exert yourself.",

            "answer": "Ugh, I feel you on this one girl! I'm 33 weeks almost 34 & I've gained almost 40 pounds!! I went from 155 to 193 :((( my doctor wasn't concerned for the first 6 months but two appointments ago I gained 9 pounds in 2 weeks and he started to get worried. Normal weight woman are supposed to gain 30 pounds for their entire pregnancy and here I am surpassing that. Sorry I don't know the kg conversion off the top of my head. He doesn't want me to diet but just to watch what I eat and how much I eat. Last 2 weeks I gained only 1.5 pounds so he was happy. I'm just so depressed with my body and weight gain :(( he sent me for gestational diabetes testing cuz he thought I had it. Too much weight gain is bad for you and for baby and so he scared me. I'm trying to eat better foods and less of it and less snacking but it's hard. Good luck!!!!!! Hope it works out better for you than me.",
