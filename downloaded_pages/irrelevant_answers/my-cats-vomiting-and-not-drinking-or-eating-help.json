            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I would most definitely call around to other vets and check prices.\u00a0\u00a0Explain your situation, and I'm pretty sure that others will not be anywhere near as high as $1000/night.\u00a0\u00a0My vet is very expensive here, and for the care you described, it would be something around $200.And, you can always contact your local humane society or ASPCA, they will always give discounts on some good medical care, but you may have to bring something to prove your income.\u00a0\u00a0This is worth the call.In the mean time, if this were my cat, I would run out and buy some meat baby foods.\u00a0\u00a0Most cats can't resist this, even when they feel like crap.\u00a0\u00a0They really like ham and chicken baby foods the best.\u00a0\u00a0Those have been faves of my cats.And, one other thing.....A vet can give the cat subQ(subcutaneous) fluids under the skin of the back of the neck, instead of an IV.\u00a0\u00a0This is very inexpensive.\u00a0\u00a0They could've given your cat the subQ's and sent him home and he would've felt a lot better.\u00a0\u00a0I'm seriously wondering why your vet didn't suggest this.Best wishes!Come back and let me know if any of these suggestions worked.",
