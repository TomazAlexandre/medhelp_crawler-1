            "answer": "Hi there!Erectile dysfunction can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. Anxiety and stress play an important role in adolescents in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, or you have difficulty controlling anxiety; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "i am 18 years old and i have a problem with my erections. i dont seem to get as hard as i used to and i am not horny anymore almost at all (i get horny very rarely), its not like i have a problem with my girlfriend because i noticed that the problem persists even when i watch porn, i usually have to get my erection started and i am not really that hard. i used to be an athlete in a sports team and now i only go to the gym a 2-3 times a week but i dont take any supplements, i try to have a balanced diet but i dont really eat fruits but i do eat salads a few times a week. Also i smoke shisha but very rarely, maybe like 2 times a month or sometimes lessP.S. i usually get quite harder and bigger when my gf gives me a ******* but i think i could do better than that in the past. if there is a question let me know and i will add more information, thanks",
