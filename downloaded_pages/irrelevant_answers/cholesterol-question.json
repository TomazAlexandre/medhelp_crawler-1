I am only on trace meds for my condition. My cholesterol is now total 142 ldl=71, hdl=59, trigly=68.my blood pressure is under this morning was 114/64, which is normal for me these days.I read dr fuhmans book \"EAT TO LIVE\" which is where I received the life style changes I needed to save my life. I am no Dr but I believe your ldl is way to high and your hld is a bit low ,for one with diabetes, which is a big risk factor for heart disease.Best you see a Doctor( Cardio Doctor) that can really help answer your questions , and read Dr Fuhrmans book .It saved my life.Brian Clark.",
