            "answer": "Just saying, a nutritionist isn't likely to be very helpful if the problem is your child won't eat anything but what she wants to -- a nutritionist can tell you what's best to eat but not what your child will tolerate going in her mouth.\u00a0\u00a0But if you do decide to see a nutritionist, there are two types -- holistic, which is what I would see, and the standard ones who devise hospital menus and institutional menus -- if you've ever eaten hospital food or institutional food you've seen what nutritionists will do.\u00a0\u00a0Holistic nutritionists will focus more on the individual and on organic food and the like, but they can also be very ideological about a certain approach, so as with any medical professional, be wary.",

            "answer": "I have an extremely picky 11-year-old son. It is SO hard! I went into parenting with grand plans about all the healthy foods I'd prepare and offer, but he was picky literally from the first day we started solids. I know some people feel picky eating is a behavioral issue or an issue of poor parenting, but after having dealt with this for many years - and after having two other children who approach food completely differently - I'm convinced it's something inborn in him. There is some indication that genetics can affect picky eating and taste perception, and I wonder if my son deals with that.We try to keep mealtimes as calm as possible, and we keep offering healthy foods. We've also talked about what makes/keeps a body healthy, and that sometimes staying healthy is an issue of mind-over-matter. My dad is diabetic and has had some complications due to his diabetes, and we've talked about how Grandpa doesn't always feel like eating the way his diabetes requires, but to prevent consequences he has to do it. Looking at food with a more detached perspective like that has helped some.I would definitely consider getting some assistance if you haven't found a way to break through, even a little. At this age, there's also the added wrinkle of full-blown eating disorders developing, and that makes me a bit nervous.Hang in there! I know it's terribly frustrating!",

    "question": "My 12 year old daughter is an extremely picky eater--she won't eat anything that she thinks she might not like or remind her of anything she thinks she doesn't like. She convinces herself it's gross and will not try anything. If we try and punish her for refusing to eat, she gets sick and throws up. Once we let her eat junk food or any other unhealthy thing, she stops being \"sick\" and is just fine again. My question is whether or not this behavior is normal of a 12 yo or should we seek help from a nutritionist or therapist or other type of doctor?",
