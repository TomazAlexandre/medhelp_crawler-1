            "answer": "Hi,The possibility of migraines cannot be ruled out especially if you have a positive family history of migraines. Migraines can occur with or without headaches and tingling numbness on one side of the body is a symptom of migraine. However it is important to rule out other possibilities also like peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, B 12 deficiency and thyroid dysfunction. TIA can also cause these symptoms although in TIA the onset of these symptoms is acute.I would suggest you to get a clinical exam done by your GP and discuss these possibilities with him.Keep us posted!",
