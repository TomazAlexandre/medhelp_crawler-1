But they keeped checking his sugar st the hospital and it broke my heart. Thanks God all the test come back good. I was diagnosticed at 28 weeks. And they make me check my sugar 4 times a day. The nutriilogist will work with you to do a meal plan according to your schedule. Basically i had 3 meals a day what you need to watch is the carbohidrats i was allowed 45 to 60g of carbohidrats on each meal and i have two snacks between meals of 15g of carbs. The bigs NO. no soda just diet. NO juice any kind they have a lot of sugar. No cakes. The milk try to get the 2% or 1% if you need any info let me know i will be happy to talk :-)",
