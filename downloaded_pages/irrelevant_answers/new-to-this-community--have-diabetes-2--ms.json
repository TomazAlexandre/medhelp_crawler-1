    "question": "Hi everyone!\u00a0\u00a0I'm\u00a0\u00a0new to your Diabetes 2 Community but have been involved some with the MS community.I have Multiple Sclerosis but was diagnosed about 2 years ago with diabetes 2.\u00a0\u00a0When I first learned my blood sugar was high at 364, I immediately and without hesitation went on a diet and lost about 45 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I did pretty good for a year and a half, but then I began eating sweets again.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, my best friend and Mom were very ill and dying, so I did a lot of stress eating.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say, I gained most of my weight back and my blood sugar got elevated again.Now, my PCP has me taking Metformin and I'm trying to lose weight again.\u00a0\u00a0Trying to eat less carbs.\u00a0\u00a0I crave sugar so badly.\u00a0\u00a0Do you guys have any recipes for desserts that are diabetic friendly?\u00a0\u00a0I've been eating fruit and I know that they say be careful of the sugars in grapes and bananas, but I really like having something that feels like dessert.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, any help is much appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance.",
