            "answer": "Hi, understand your concern. Drooling or excess salivation happens in infancy and then we learn to overcome this as our swallowing reflex improves. Medications can dry out the secretions but you may have side effects, like dry throat. And as medications cannot be used indefinitely the best bet would be to voluntarily control this. Try to swallow the excessive saliva periodically, though initially it is a conscious effort, overtime it will become a habit which will control your symptoms effectively. Good Luck.",

            "answer": "If the problem is intermittent, it can result from reflux, irritating acid coming\u00a0\u00a0from the stomach. When I have large props in my tonsils, they irritate my tissues so that I get sneezes and increased salivation.",
