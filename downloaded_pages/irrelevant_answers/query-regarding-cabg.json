            "answer": "My personal experience: Two stents\u00a0\u00a0eight years ago blocked within weeks. Problem solved with CABG. The bypass grafts are still completely open after eight years.The attractive thing about stenting is you can have it done on a Friday and be at work after a weekend's rest. The bad thing, as I mentioned before, is the higher likelihood of restenosis. The new drug eluting stents have reduced incidences of restenosis but at the cost of having to take blood thinners for longer period of time or for life.With CABG recovery takes longer and it is\u00a0\u00a0a costlier procedure, however, over the long term that may be a better option.I wish your father well.",
