He is about to finish his rehab up and feels much better but still complains of being tired often.\u00a0\u00a0They could not find a reason to why he had one also.\u00a0\u00a0They ran every test-all negative.\u00a0\u00a0No heart disease, diabetes, high cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0All they said they knew was sat it was caused by a clot.\u00a0\u00a0Now his father had one when he was his age, but he is 90 something now.\u00a0\u00a0So I guess I didn't really answer your question!\u00a0\u00a0I have the same question myself.. and i'm a nurse.",
