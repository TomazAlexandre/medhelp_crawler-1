            "answer": "Hi, Zyprexa (olanzapine) is used to treat the symptoms of psychotic conditions such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. You should always follow the directions of your doctor regarding medications. Your doctor knows you and is able to take your numerous specific circumstances into consideration when deciding what medication and how much is likely appropriate for you specifically.\u00a0\u00a0This medications is only rarely used at a higher dose and then it's usually for psychiatric indications instead of just insomnia. Also, the higher dose has not been shown to be more effective for insomnia.\u00a0\u00a0Also, this medication should not be used for more than 1 month. Medications, however, are not the ideal choice of treatment for insomnia anyway. You can consult a sleep specialist to help with your insomnia. Regards.",

            "answer": "Thanks Dr AnithaI was prescribed with Zyprexa because I was crying without stop and kind of paranoid. I took it for almost 4 months.I have never had sleeping problems before. I feel ok mentally and physically. I am not anxious, paranoid or depressed now but I cannot sleep without taking gabapentin (I am never tired or sleepy, there are other people describing a situation similar to mine after stop taking Zyprexa). I am worry, because the same way Zyprexa can make people have diabetes, it can permanently disrupt other psychological process in the brain an produce this chronic insomnia. I am incline to think that the damage is at the hypothalamus, I am never hungry or thirsty.I will definitely follow your advice and consult a sleep specialist.",

    "question": "I took Zyprexa for 6 months but since I began experiencing some side effects I suddenly stopped taking the drug (no weaning off). When I stopped the medication,\u00a0\u00a0I started with serious problems (a lot of crying, anxiety, panic attack and sleep problems). I did not sleep for 3 days, then I slept like for three days. I do not feel tired anymore, I do not get that sleepy tired feeling. I have tried many meds to help me to sleep (trazodone, klonopin, Geodon..) nothing help. Now I am sleeping 2-3 hours a night with the help of gabapentin, but I do not feel tired, I DO NOT GET SLEEPY. Please help, I have been in this situation for almost a year. Can the damage done by the drug be permanent? Should I see a neurologist? Please help",
