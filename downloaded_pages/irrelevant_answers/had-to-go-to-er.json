The 24 week seems not to be doing it anymore.I don't feel good today. Head splitter that ibuprofen will not help. Feverish feeling without the temp and weak.The first round was a piece of cake compared to this. I'm on the same meds too.When you guys clear don't forget to get new toiletries. Tooth brush, nail clippers, ect, ect. And do it often.",

            "answer": "First of all, a blood sugar of 225 at any time, even after a meal, means you have diabetes, although hopefully it's only a side effect of treatment and will go away when you're done.\u00a0\u00a0And a fasting blood sugar should not be over 100, ever.Now, our bodies react to high blood sugar by churning out insulin, but it happens too late, and this insulin can cause low blood sugar, i.e. hypoglycemia, which can make you pass out.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not saying that this is what happened to you, only a doctor can diagnose that, but you definitely need to get the appropriate tests to determine what's going on and how to treat it.\u00a0\u00a0Possibly something else is going on as well, but you should never have such a high blood sugar reading without doing something about it.\u00a0\u00a0A good endocrinologist might be a helpful addition to your medical team.",

            "answer": "I didn't mean to be so abrupt in the previous post.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to say that, as a diabetic in a family of diabetics, I don't consider diabetes to be a particularly terrible disease in the scheme of things.\u00a0\u00a0It's certainly easier to deal with than hcv, at least for me.\u00a0\u00a0But like hcv, diabetes asks you to take care of yourself, to eat healthy foods, get enough exercise, and of course no smoking and little or no drinking (and none during tx).\u00a0\u00a0If you don't do these things, however, diabetes can kick you in the ass.\u00a0\u00a0But maybe you're just having a reaction to INF and/or riba and it's temporary.\u00a0\u00a0I have several friends who've had gestational diabetes, for example, and after giving birth their glucose readings returned to normal.Check out these google groups: http://groups.google.com/group/alt.support.diabetes/topics?lnk=srg, AND http://groups.google.com/group/misc.health.diabetes/topics?lnk=srg,\u00a0\u00a0And you'll be fine.\u00a0\u00a0See your doctor.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm back after a long break. I relapsed after a 24 week term for HCV Geno type-2. Took a year break.I'm, now on my 6th of 48 week second round.I'd like to report what happened to me for your comments.The Monday after my 4th injection I was at work and my hands started shaking. I felt weird but not alarmed.I went to sit and rest and noticed I could hear a slow pulsation in my hearing like listening into a sea-shell but very slight.Then slowly I felt faint, weak, very hot with a hard forehead sweat. I couldn't help but notice my groin area felt really hot for about a minute.This was at the break-room table. With my head in my hands my co-workers asked if I was OK. I asked them not to leave me. At the rate it was accelerating I felt I would be passed out in less than a minute.We have EMRT's in house. They grabbed a wheel chair and checked my BP and I was not bad at all. I started coming out of it and blamed it on the TX. Like last time I felt no SX until the 4th or so injection.An hour later it returned and I went to the local ER. My blood sugar was 225. This was the only thing out of the norm but for a heart rate change from lying down to standing. They kept me for 24 hours, the blood sugar went down to 120 and it has not repeated.I've done another injection and feel OK but for the head aches. What do you think? Blood sugar attack?",
