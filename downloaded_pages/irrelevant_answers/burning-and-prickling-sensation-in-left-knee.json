            "answer": "Hi there. You need to check with the orthopaedician for ruling out a pinched nerve sural or saphenous nerve branch being impinged in the knee joint. Since burning sensation is positional with reference to the knee joint. You might need corticosteroids and physical therapy.\u00a0\u00a0Rule out diabetes and B12 deficiency, rheumatoid arthritis and hypothyroidism. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Thank you, this did help. Today I have noticed a new symptom, however. The area around my knee is beginning to go numb. I still have some feeling in most places, but almost none in others. Am I right in concluding that this pain and numbness is not due to my muscle?",

    "question": "A few weeks ago my knee began to get random stings (like someone pricked me with a needle) when I would bend my knee. However, it would disappear almost immediately when I straightened it. Recently, I have been having more continuous pain, it feels like I should have a floor burn on my knee but there isn't one. It also has this prickly feeling to it. I saw an orthopedist who simply said the pain was due to overuse of my muscle, however he never asked me to describe the pain. I have had sore and overused muscles before and it has felt nothing like this. Does anyone know if he is correct in his diagnosis? I am afraid since he doesn't know this detail he could be wrong.Also, I recently suffered a head and neck injury and shortly after my ear started to hurt. Now it is getting hard to hear our of this ear. Does anyone know if these could somehow be related? Or is it simply fluid or something else in my ear?",
