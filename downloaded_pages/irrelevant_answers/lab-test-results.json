            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0Aren't lab reports frustratingly greek?\u00a0\u00a0Worse, once you get into it you learn that lab work provides doctors indicators but cannot be used to diagnose by themselves.\u00a0\u00a0It is important to understand that you can test high or low for some things and not have any conditions with which they are associated.Did your doctor indicate what he/she thinks you have?\u00a0\u00a0My doc would not let me have my results until I came in for my next visit.\u00a0\u00a0When is your next appt.?\u00a0\u00a0What symptoms are you experiencing?\u00a0\u00a0How long has this been going on?Ok, enough of my questions.\u00a0\u00a0Here is what I can say about your labs.Your ANA is elevated at 1:160.\u00a0\u00a0Negative is below 1:40 and below 1:80 is generally not significantYour ANA pattern is homogeneous, the pattern is used to help with the dx as different patterns go with different diseases.CRP and ESR are indicators of inflammation and it looks like you are normal thereLow ferritin can indicate low iron which can be associated with anemiaLow levels of vitamin D can be associated with a number of things",
