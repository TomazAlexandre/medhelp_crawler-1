            "answer": "Yes, food poisoning can cause harm to your baby, and it can be a very serious issue that requires antibiotics, so if you think you may have gotten food poisoning make sure you see a doctor! Usually it happens quickly after, and you have diarrhea, vomitting, sharp pains, etc, it could definitely be morning sickness if it's just vomitting. Is there anything you've eaten that concerns you??",
