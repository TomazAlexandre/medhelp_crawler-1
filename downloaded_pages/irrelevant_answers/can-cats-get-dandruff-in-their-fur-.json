    "question": "Hello fellow cat parents,We have a male ginger cat called Sammy. He's eight years old. The other day while I was doing a brushing,I noticed that he has white flakes on his fur that look like dandruff. Sammy was just to the vet about a monthago for his check up. Everything was good, but he needs some attention to his teeth, an issue which I willhave to attend to in the next couple of months.. We adopted Sammy almost 2 years ago. Any suggestions aboutwhat is causing this are welcome. He doesn't seem to be bothered by this, but I am.Do you think I should take Sammy to the vet and let the vet see the flakes of loose skin ? Thanks, Eve.",
