            "answer": "A great deal of the correct answer to your question would depend on whether or not the twins were identical.\u00a0\u00a0A friend of mine who has twins (one of the twins has type 1 diabetes) researched this topic and she found that there was a greater risk if the twins were identical.\u00a0\u00a0There is a blood test that can be done that indicates if a person is pre-disposed to developing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This test is not a life-time marker and should be done yearly if there is concern.\u00a0\u00a0Your granddaughter's physician should be contacted to fill her parents in to more details about such testing.Please be sensitive to using such phrases as 'normal' when referring to your non-diabetic grandchild as both of your grandchildren are 'normal'.\u00a0\u00a0One just happens to have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You want to send a positive message to support them in their daily lives while dealing with diabetes.A very good place for you to obtain support for yourself and your other family members in dealing with type 1 diabetes is the online diabetes support team, or ODST that can be found at www.jdrf.org.\u00a0\u00a0They offer one-on-one support and reassurance and can find others who may have experienced similar things that you have. They are there to help you gain some insight into how to deal with topics that you may have questions about.\u00a0\u00a0It really helps to talk to someone who has been there before.\u00a0\u00a0Please contact them, you'll be glad that you did.",

Should I be fearful that the 'normal' child will eventually develope Type 1 diabetes?Is there is any relationship documented pro or con either way???? thank you.",
