    "question": "However, I do have \"pre diabetes\" which I have had for over 10 years, so nothing new here.\u00a0\u00a0My A1C was 5.3.\u00a0\u00a0My numbers ever 1/2 hour were a little lower than what my monitor read.\u00a0\u00a0So, maybe it's my monitor?\u00a0\u00a0I don' tknow.\u00a0\u00a0But I\"m putting it away for a while and not thinking about it LOL!\u00a0\u00a0So, that's that. So, what I still and only have is \"neuropathy in my feet\".\u00a0\u00a0I'll keep taking the meds for that - the Gabapentin (neurotonin) and keep you guys updated.\u00a0\u00a0I've decided that I am still going to go low carb and lose some weight. I don't understand my weight, this AM I got up and it was friggen 209 - I gained 1.5 in one day?\u00a0\u00a0I need to go low carb to combat the effects this medication is having on my body - and it ain't good LOL!\u00a0\u00a0 Plus, I took my son to the Dr. yesterday, (he will be 6 in march), he is 3'10\" tall and weighs 175, which is NOT good.\u00a0\u00a0I need to find out where he is getting all the calories from, cause it sure ain't at home.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to start packing his lunches from now on.\u00a0\u00a0ANd i am going to make a little workout area for us downstairs.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to find a video for mom/child to exercise too and we're going to get FIT.\u00a0\u00a0Gotta go, work is getting my way of posting LOL!!",
