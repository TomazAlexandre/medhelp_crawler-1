            "answer": "Hello Linda,Type 2 is often a progressive condition.What is your \"normal\" Hba1c?\u00a0\u00a0A non-diabetic HBa1c is usually in the 4 to low 5 range.If you are\u00a0\u00a0not managing to keep your sugars under control by exercise alone, you could try adopting a low carb diet (Look up Diabetes Solutions by Dr. Richard Bernstein), eliminating sugars and refined carbs, if you are not doing this already.If the diet and exercise are not together working, then, yes it is time for insulin.\u00a0\u00a0It is actually better to start insulin while your pancreas is still working (as lower doses are required to nromalise blood sugars and there is less risk of lows).Please ask us if you want further information.",
