            "answer": "Hi there. Im not a doctor but i will try help. How bad was the BP recently? How did you know it was high? What meds has doc put you on? The blood results are a good sign. But what was tested? Some kidney issues can cause a rise in Bp, . The 24 hour urine is also used for checking Cathecholomines. These are hormones in the blood and sometimes rarely Adrenal issues cause them to rise. I think its aldesterone .This can cause high BP spikes. Its very rare, but the doctor will want to outrule this as a starting point. Its best to do this, as often BP meds are for life! and they all come with side effects. So try relax and be a little patient till your testing is complete. Try not to panic, its always hard not to let your mind run away with things and think the worst. One thing for sure, I would make sure to have a 24 Hour ABPM test. Its simple and gives a proper full day BP reading. Insist on this, its non invasive and costs little. Hope this is of some help",

    "question": "Hi! I'm new to this group but was hoping to find some insight. I have 2 children and the youngest is 10 months and I had hypertension during both of my pregnancies. After I gave birth my blood pressure lowered again but this past week I have had bad high blood pressure again and went to the dr and he started me on medicine and did lab work. All of my lab work came back normal but he had me have a renal ultrasound today to check kidney function. I'm haven't heard my results but during the ultrasound the tech asked if I was diabetic and when I said no, she just stopped talking. Now I'm nervous she saw something but couldn't say anything. Anyone else have kidney issues but initial blood work came back normal? I'm doing the 24 hour urine test this weekend. Any info is appreciated! Oh and I'm a 32 year old female and in good health so that's why this is so weird to me.",
