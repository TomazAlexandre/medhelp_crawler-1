Try the herpetic (herpes diet) to see if you can get some relief.\u00a0\u00a0Keep doing your own research (careful not to tell your doctor what you think it is based off websites).\u00a0\u00a0I've had several people refer me to a naturapath doctor, since 'main stream insurance' doctors don't always diagnose reality.\u00a0\u00a0That is $$$ out of pocket.",

    "question": "Hi, firstly I've had both chicken pox and shingles and know its rare to get it a third time but following months of hellish symptoms and little clear test results I turned to a friend of the family who's a retired Dr & he seems to think it could be another flare up or post shingles complications. I've been describing my severe burning, knoring, pain & itching as like when I had shingles 6 yes ago only now its much deeper & has spread in bands to other areas folloeing nerve paths. Since it hit my neck & started spreading through my ears, temples & face I've had horrendous neuro symptoms including dizziness, night sweats, hearing loss, middle ear pain, numb face, probs chewing and swallowing, weakness & numbness in shoulders & arms, tongue & severe cognitive impairment. Its starting to affect my eyes now too as pain feels referred there from my neck & temples. I have had many spots come up in these burning areas of pain but not a rash as such, more tiny pustules, some bigger & getting larger ones too. Also darkened areas like small freckes in same areas. Also dropped weight, thirsty & feeling very unwell. Ive had the obvious tests (diabetes, autoimmune, mri, ct, ultrasound) all normal. Just elevated white cells, ESR & IgA. Confused I turned to Google and found a lot of info on post shingles comolications & it seems it is possible even without a rash and can turn into severe neuro conditions. My pain is so severe I'm on amitryptolin as regular meds don't touch it.Has anyone else experienced complications of shingles or see any correlaton between my symptoms & post shingles compkications? And if so how did u get diagnosed? I know it may not be this but my friend thinks it needs ruling out. He isn't an expert on it though.Cheers,",
