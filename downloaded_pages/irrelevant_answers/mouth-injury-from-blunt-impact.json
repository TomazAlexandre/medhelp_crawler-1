    "question": "A week ago I sustained a blunt impact to the right side of my mouth. There was minor abrassion, but no laceration, and the swelling subsided with ice after just a few days.My concern is that I'm experiencing a strange issue with my upper lip in that area... When I try to compress my lips together, or create a very tight pucker, there is signifcantly decreased strength in that area, causing my mouth to look very lopsided. It looks and feels similar to when I've received novocaine for dental work (however not as severe) and seems slightly paralyzed.Does this sound like temporary nerve or muscle damage? (hopefully) And if it is likely temporary, how long until it should resolve itself?Thank you in advance for your help!",
