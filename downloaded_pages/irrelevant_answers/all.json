            "answer": "Hello,Boils are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Recurrent boils are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders. So please get your blood sugar evaluated. If the blood sugar is normal then immune system disorders have to be ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
