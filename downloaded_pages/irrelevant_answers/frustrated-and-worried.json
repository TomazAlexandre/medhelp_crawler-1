    "question": "So today I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I try to prepare myslef for the possibility of this happening. I didnt think I would take it as hard as I have. I know there are some complications that can come along with it. Like a larger than normal baby which I am already likely to have. My first child was 9lbs and 13ozs without any issues. Now I cant stop crying and thinking about all the possibilities. I go to the diabetic clinic tomorrow first thing. I am trying to keep myself calm till them but it is harder than I thought. It doesnt help my husband is at work and I cant talk to him about it. We have no other family near by. I am trying to be calm but all I want to do is cry.",
