            "answer": "It would be helpful to know what you're doing to control your diabetes. Are you watching your food intake keeping your carbs low and not consuming sugary foods? I say this because your A1c is HIGH .Are you taking some sort of oral medication liike Metformin (Glucophage) to help lower your glucose? What about injectable insulin? How often to do you perform a home glucose test? And when?Wait to see your Taxoplasmosis results. Some symptoms do apply but your PCP will know better. Without knowing what your PCP said about your circulation issues its hard to make a comment. If you're not satisfied with how your current PCP is treating you and/or answering your concerns, go find another doctor until you find one that listens to you.Good luck",

            "answer": "Keep up with your diabetes control. That's an atta-girl. Others may disagree but I don't think its never too late to get it in under control. You can reduce the amount of diabetes medication by controlling your diet and using moderate exercise.My PCP warned me about large glucose swings being as dangerous as a high, to monitor my food intake and always take my Metformin (500mg) at the same time period each day.Discuss your concerns about the Neuropathy with your PCP until you are satisfied with his/her answers. The head part is unusual since Diabetes related Neuropathy\u00a0\u00a0mostly occurs in the feet and legs and sometimes is reported in the digestive tract. If treatment is in order be sure to go through each step and understand them accordingly.Here's a link to a Diabetes Dictionary by the ADA. Read through the list of terms and definitions and include any with your PCP discussions.http://tinyurl.com/3xdxt5Good luck and good health.",

    "question": "Hi, I hope someone can help me.\u00a0\u00a0For 10 days now\u00a0\u00a0I've been experiencing coldness which started from my feet-ankles-legs- thighs, then traveled to buttocks arms --face--head --mouth-ears and nose. I have been having sharp, burning pain in feet. (Thats where the pain started)\u00a0\u00a0I only have pain in feet. I went to see my doctor: she gave me blood tests--A1C\u00a0\u00a06.8,\u00a0\u00a0THyroid\u00a0\u00a0normal, and Toxoplasmosis test did come in yet. I have been diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. My cat has Toxoplasmosis and is being treated for it. Do you think I have Diabetes Neuropathy?\u00a0\u00a0Doctor isn't sure yet. I at times breakout in sweats ( sugar is at good Range).\u00a0\u00a0My body Temp was 96.4 for a little while, then went up to 97.7, it does go up to 98.6.\u00a0\u00a0Even my tongue gets cold. The coldness is causing me to sneeze alot and loose sleep. I am scared. If my body is cold, does it mean that it's loosing oxygen?\u00a0\u00a0Circulation?\u00a0\u00a0I have had nerve damage before from surgery in both feet. And I have 2 herniated disk and a cervical buldging\u00a0\u00a0disk. ( Due to a fall.).\u00a0\u00a0I can feel my feet, no numbness now. Prior to them becoming cold they did at times feel numb in certain spots. i have to sleep sitting up or I will get colder. My doctor doesn't think that I should go to the ER.Thank you",
