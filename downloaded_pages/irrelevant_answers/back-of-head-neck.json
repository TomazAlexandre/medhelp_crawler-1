            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The symptoms could be due to spinal nerve compression at the upper cervical level. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. You may need a MRI to rule this out. Consult a neurologist. You may also need nerve conduction study. Peripheral vascular pathologies have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies.You could possibly be suffering from glove-and-stocking neuropathy There are many causes of this nerve disorder including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Demyelinating peripheral neuropathies like\u00a0\u00a0Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
