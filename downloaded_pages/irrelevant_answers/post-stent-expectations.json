            "answer": "Thank you for your response. I am still very concerned about the other part of my question:\u00a0\u00a0he is still having angina pain (almost 2 weeks now) after the stent placement.\u00a0\u00a0The pain comes with the least exertion and ranges from a #1 to a #8.\u00a0\u00a0 He \"doesn't feel quite right\". The doctor has added another med -Isosorbide MN E-R but there doesn't seem to be much change. Is this normal or cause for concern?",

            "answer": "After I had a stent fitted in 2004, I was unable to walk more than 50 yards without severe angina symptoms. In fact, I was worse than before the procedure. This did take a few weeks to settle down and now I walk a brisk 3 miles a day. I think my problem was the artery protesting at being stretched and taking a while to settle down.",

            "answer": "My dad had 4 stents put in about a month ago and is still having some chest pressure. He gets worried and thinks that he's going to have problems again and I keep telling him that he needs to take it easy for now and build up to more activity slowly. The cardiologist told him that everything was being restructured and was starting to function properly which was also part of the reason for some of the pain.",

    "question": "My husband is 70, has medication controlled diabetes, had triple bypass in 2001 and on 11/7 had 5 stents placed in two \"native arteries\" because of increasing angina pain similar to what he had before the bypass.\u00a0\u00a0He has never had a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0He always passes treadmill and stress tests with flying colors, even two days before his bypass.\u00a0\u00a0In June he passed the chemical stress tests with the dye injections.\u00a0\u00a0His grafted arteries from 2001 look great on the angio.\u00a0\u00a0I have been trying to find articles that describe what to expect post-stent because he has been having agina pain since the procedure and just \"doesn't feel quite right\".\u00a0\u00a0Is this normal or cause for concern?\u00a0\u00a0Taking Plavix, Accupril, Aspirin, Foltx, Metoprolol, Fish Oil.\u00a0\u00a0Can't take statin drugs because of the muscle pain caused my them.\u00a0\u00a0Should he try them again? Is there a test that can show if he is developing rhabdomyolysis?",
