            "answer": "An A1c of 6.4% implies your daily glucose on average is 136.98 mg/dl which puts you into the diabetes class. A fasting glucose indicates your glucose at the time of test not what is was the day or week before. Your doctor is correct by having you follow exercise and proper nutrition. Please include proper weight as all three play large roles in controlling glucose levels. Below 6% is ideal.",

            "answer": "Here's where you stand. Your A1c says you're a diabetic. However, your fasting glucose says you're not. I'm going to venture by sticking my neck out that this is the reason your doctor wants a retest in 6 months.I'm also a little surprised that your doctor didn't look at the potential of you being a LADA [latent autoimmune diabetes in adults] patient, also known as type 1.5 diabetes. Here is a Google search on type 1.5 and lada.
