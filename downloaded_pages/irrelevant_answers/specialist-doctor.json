            "answer": "I was offered genetics counseling based on my age, I chose to decline it. If my baby has any genetics issue I would still choose to keep my baby, the only benefit would be to know if anything is wrong and to be prepared. I am not doing a amniotisis (sp?) That is also why I declined the genetics counseling.",

            "answer": "I thought the same thing (extra expense). My issue is my age 39 and initially starting to show signs of uncontrolled diabetes (bad meter false alarm). They explained that there are risks associated with our age set beyond genetics that we are prone to that pregnancy can trigger or make worse. Initially the neonatologist wanted to see me every two weeks inaddition to my ob appt I compromised to once a month and agreed to send my diabetic readings periodically. If I didn't have diabetes then I would have told them once a trimester or until I showed a reason to more. Your call though!",

            "answer": "Amino is not what they recommend anymore there are several blood tests just as accurate. You only see a genetics counselor once usually. We would not abort unless its tasaks(sp). We wanted to be aware that's all. They do family history of mom and dad tell you % of risk then offer you blood test. If blood test comes back as a problem you are offered further testing but yet again up to you.",
