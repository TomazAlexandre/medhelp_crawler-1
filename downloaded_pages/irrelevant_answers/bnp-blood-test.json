            "answer": "It could indicate either heart or kidney disease, I don't know about the lungs, but 700+ at age 50 is very high, and indicative of a serious condition.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a health professional, so consider that when reading my post.I'm over 70 with Congestive Heart Failure and have had three BNP tests in the last month, the average # is about 3000.\u00a0\u00a0From what I know, anything over 900 is considered very serious for someone with CHF, and anything over about 450 for someone without CHD is serious.It sounds like she has a very serious condition, but certainly a health professional will be on top of a test with those numbers.\u00a0\u00a0I'm still able to get around and enjoy my grandchildren's games and family functions, but at a diminished level, hopefully your friend can keep a positive attitude while being pretty ill.keep us informed.",
