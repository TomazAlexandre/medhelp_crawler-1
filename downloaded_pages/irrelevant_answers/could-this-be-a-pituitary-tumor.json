I was in your exact shoes a few months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Turns out I do have a pituitary tumor, but it's sooooo small.\u00a0\u00a0I am being treated with Dostinex (Cabergoline) and in 8 weeks time my prolactin is 3.4! YAY me.\u00a0\u00a0I feel a lot better too.\u00a0\u00a0Side effects are noticable at first from meds, but overall effect is worth it!",

            "answer": "You certainly have the most common symptoms of a pituitary tumor, but this doesn't mean you have one. The endocrinologist will decide if an MRI is needed, and probably order more blood tests.Do you have more trouble getting up in the morning than is normal for you?\u00a0\u00a0Is your peripheral vision good?\u00a0\u00a0The endocrinologist should order an eye exam to check your vision status.Try to write down any questions you have for the endo.And try not to worry until you get more test results. It's possible there is no tumor.Enzy",

            "answer": "Hi, how are you today? Have you had any imaging tests done yet, like an mri? It is good that you are going to a endocrinologist. Something to keep in mind is that if things are really pointing towards issues with your pituitary that you are going to want to have a endo that specializes in the pituitary. How long have you been having symptoms? A mri is really the only way to tell if you have a pituitary tumor.Have a list of question written out before going.1. Ask how much experience they have with pituitary issues.2.\u00a0\u00a0ask about getting a mri.....they may want to start with a ct scan first be prepared for that.",

            "answer": "Prolactin can be elevated because of thyroid, medications or due to a pituitary tumor - those are the most common reasons.Typically, a prolactinoma is treated with medications.You should get an MRI with and without contrast (preferably *dynamic*) so you have the best chance to see it but even so up to 40% do not show up even if one is there as they are so small.CTs usually do not show them unless they are very large or it is an empty sella.Testing is the best way to show what is going on really - as MRIs are only so so in accuracy. Mine hid for 12 years!Make sure you get copies of everything - tests, films, reports and then learn to understand them. It takes a while but it is worth it.I had a prolactinoma and Cushing's tumor.",

            "answer": "I had a pituitary tumor 27 years ago that started being a micro and within 6 mos. turned into a macro.\u00a0\u00a0It was removed and since then, so far so good.\u00a0\u00a0I had amenorrhea/galactorrhea which was the first symptom manifesting itself to take me to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I went through numerous tests within the 6 mos. period and it was explained to me the damage to the optic nerve that could happen if I didn't have it removed.\u00a0\u00a0I left the hospital on demopressin, but surprisingly the need cleared up and later I found that diabetes insipidus can occur due to trauma.\u00a0\u00a0Since they went up through my nasal passage to remove the tumor, and grafted skin from the groin area , it was a trauma to that area.\u00a0\u00a0There is so much more known now.",

            "answer": "My son's endocrinologist seems to take it for granted that he will have diabetes insipidusafter surgery. It does result from trauma to the pituitary during surgery for many people. His adenoma is on the anterior part of the gland, whereas diabetes insipidus is caused by damage to the posterior lobe.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't make me want to rush him into surgery to know this!This is one of the reasons it's important to find an experienced neurosurgeon, who has done a LOT of pituitary surgeries.",

Vangilder, MD at the University Of Iowa Hospital performed the surgery for me.\u00a0\u00a0I was only in my early 20's.\u00a0\u00a0They couldn't tell me why it developed and grew so fast in such a short time into a macro-tumor.\u00a0\u00a0It was starting to press on the optic nerve and affecting my peripheral vision.\u00a0\u00a0They told me it shouldn't come back, but that women older in their 40's or so had those type of tumors.I never researched it, because at the time this all happened, I was a nursing student and it totally changed my perspective on the direction I would take. When they took the packing out of my nose, I laid on the bed trying so hard to stay still with tears streaming out the corners of my eyes from the pain.\u00a0\u00a0I remember being told that if I hadn't have had the surgery, I wouldn't have been able to have children.No one told me about the diabetes Insipidus.\u00a0\u00a0I woke in the middle of the night feeling like someone hit me with a hammer and needing to urinate frequently.",

He will be 13 next week, though he still looks 9, from lack of growth hormone. He also has a macroadenoma, close to the optic chiasm. I check his peripheral vision daily. So far, so good.I have a lot of decisions to make, affecting his future. He says he doesn't care about growth hormone loss and being short, if he can avoid surgery. If only it were that simple.",
