            "answer": "No, you weren't inappropriate, not at all. That's why I pointed you towards the skin infection forums. Age and diabetes do play a factor in one getting cellulitus but so does certain types of insect and spider bites. They can transmit bacteria and start an infection. Other causes for bacterial entry are dry, flaky skin, swollen skin, a recent cuts, puncture wounds, and even ulcers from what I've read. I though it was best for you and your husband to address the skin infection at this time rather than diabetes.",

    "question": "My husband is 57, has Type II diabetes. He developed cellulitis approx. 7 years ago. Up to this time it has flared up only if or when he bumped his leg. he would run a very high fever, take a course of antibiotics and it would clear up. However, this time he takes the antibiotics and as soon as he quits taking the pills the infection starts back up. We are both at out wits end. I want him to go see another doctor that specializes in this area. Question is what sort of doctor do we look for? If anyone can help I would appreciate any thoughts. This condition is causing my husband to fall into a deep depression.Thanks",
