            "answer": "I don't think this supplement will do anything for your adrenals, though it might help your memory.\u00a0\u00a0There are herbs called adaptogens that probably will be more effective and have much longer usage history to prove their effectiveness, for example, holy basil and ashwagandha will help balance the adrenals.\u00a0\u00a0However, and this is a problem for you, most natural products that lower cortisol also lower blood sugar, which means you have a problem using natural adrenal balancers until you discover what in your diet is leaving you with low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0If it were me, and it's not, I'd probably try to fix this problem through your diet, not with a drug.\u00a0\u00a0You also say you have hypoglycemia symptoms, but you don't say you tested low on blood sugar and metformin is usually used for more serious situations of diabetes, or at least I think that's true.\u00a0\u00a0At any rate, given your situation, you need to see a professional in both allopathic and natural medicine and especially someone who can analyze your diet to see where you're going wrong.\u00a0\u00a0Which means I wouldn't at this point mix adrenal balancers with what you're doing right now given that both can lower blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "I was shocked that Doc gave me Metformin and asked about it. I was told that it was also used for hypoglycemia as well because it is supposed to regulate your blood sugar. The only thing that has changed in my diet is that I am not eating as much as I used to due to loss of job---stress has taken away my appetite. I force feed myself and try to eat more protein.I don't think she wants to address the adrenal problem as she is aGP",

BUTMy A.M. cortisol level was way too high and was having awful hypoglycemic symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Doc put me om Metformin because it helps regulate glucose levels. I want to address the adrenal problem as well. Wondering if taking Seriphos would cause an interaction.\u00a0\u00a0(You see I am mixing western and holistic medicine and so I'm not sure of the outcome)",
