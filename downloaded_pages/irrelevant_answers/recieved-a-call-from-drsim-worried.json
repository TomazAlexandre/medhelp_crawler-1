            "answer": "I Dont think you should try to manipulate the test results. Just eat regular as this will be an indication about whether or not you can develop pregnancy diabetes. If so, they can take precautions. If you do manage to manipulate it and something happens that could have been prevented or anticipated on, you are going to feel sorry, so dont try to influence your results :) It's healthier and safer for the doctor to have a realistisch indicatoren",
