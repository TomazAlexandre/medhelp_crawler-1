    "question": "I know there is a few people here with blood glucose levels, weather diabetic or not. I'm not diabetic by the way, and really want to avoid it obviously.I'm just wondering if anyone has noticed if there glucose goes up when they are hypo thyroid per labs. It only makes sense to me as the pancrease might not completely do its insulin job when your hypo, so more sugar floating around in your blood.I'm not diabetic, but I keep an eye on glucose and it was 105 last week (currently very hypo but working on it).) Fall it was 100.100 - 125 is the pre diabetic area, thus my question.thanks",
