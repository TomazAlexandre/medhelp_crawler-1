            "answer": "I know 100 isn't low.... I didn't know that coffee could bring it up at all...(or splenda) because my dietician told me that neither would bring it up at all... I was just wondering if maybe my body had compensated for the drop by producing a small amount of it's own sugar like the R.N. says it does... Thank you!!!",

    "question": "I live with an R.N. (registered nurse) who says that if your blood sugar level drops too low, and you don't eat right away, your body will produce it's own sugars to bring it back up a little bit. Does anyone know if there's any truth to that? 'Cause if there's not, I may have a problem.... :-S This morning when I woke, my Blood sugar level was at 97... I drank some coffee with splenda in it- (Neither of which is supposed to raise your sugar level) and went to church. During church, I could feel the level dropping... by the time I got home, I was at 100.",
