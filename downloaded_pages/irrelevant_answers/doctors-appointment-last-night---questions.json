            "answer": "My concern is the glucose in your urine.\u00a0\u00a0Its hard to fathom a doctor who does not administer a traditional 1 hr. GTT during pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I'm stunned to hear in this day and age there are doctors who won't test for it.\u00a0\u00a0There are very serious reasons to test for gestational diabetes, which you could easily have.\u00a0\u00a0There is no way to know for sure, since your doctor won't test you.\u00a0\u00a0I just can't wrap my head around WHY he won't.\u00a0\u00a0His reason is nonsense.There are several reasons to measure big, and one might be that you are having a larger baby (which, if you have gestational diabetes you would be more at risk for), or that you have gained more weight than is indicated.\u00a0\u00a0Which is true so far.Estimates of the fetal weight done late in pregnancy are less accurate than those done earlier.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if they'll measure your cervical length or not.\u00a0\u00a0It probably isn't as important as getting a test for gestational diabetes would be, unless you have a history of preterm labor or delivery.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Marcus's mommy,Yes, it sounds attractive to explain it that way.\u00a0\u00a0But the very definition of GD depends on how a pregnant womans body reacts to a known glucose load that is measured and administered in a controlled manner.\u00a0\u00a0 Normally, a pregnant womans body handles this load by responding with predictable values of her blood glucose that fall within established ranges.A pregnant woman with GD has an abnormal response to this certain, particular amount of the known carbohydrate load.\u00a0\u00a0Clearly, your body is not handling carbohydrates in a normal manner.\u00a0\u00a0A pregnant woman can sometimes spill some small amounts of glucose in the urine, but without the regulation test, you cannot know if it is normal or not.I agree with JJety this could very well be the reason why you are measuring big.\u00a0\u00a0But without the test, you will be missing a piece of the puzzle.\u00a0\u00a0There are risks associated with having Gd above and beyond just having a big baby, too.",

My husbands Aunt did it they same way you all say, with the drink, and failed very badly both pregnancies. She thought it was strange too. She is 5 years older than me and she was pregnant the same time I was with Marcus.I will see how the u/s goes this week and I will try to eat as if I do have GD. My next appointment is March 19 and hopefully I won't have sugar in urine, but if I do I will demand the different test.Thank you ladies.",

    "question": "Hello ladies,Today I am 31 weeks pregnant. I had my doctors appointment last night. I now weight 200 pounds. I have gained 30 pounds. That part doesn't bother me too much. But I have some questions...#1\u00a0\u00a0For the last 3 visits I have had traces of sugar in my urine. Last night she said I had +2. The urine strip has normal, +1, +2, +3, +4. I'm not sure if the last 2 times were +1 or +2.\u00a0\u00a0I was tested 3 weeks ago and don't have GD. I never drank a sugar drink, doctor believes in eating normal and checking that way.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse said we need to keep an eye on it and I shouldn't eat ice cream.\u00a0\u00a0I had a bowl of it after a healthy meal of roast beef, carrots and potatoes. That was my only sweet of the day.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something to worry about? Anyone else have sugar in urine but don't have GD?#2\u00a0\u00a0Three weeks ago I measured 2 weeks big, last night I now measure 3 weeks big. My LMP is accurate, even my first u/s at 7 weeks confirmed it. Now what causes us to measure big? Am I having a huge baby?\u00a0\u00a0Marcus was only 6 lbs 11 oz and 2 days early and I gained 55 lbs. I don't thing my body can pass a 9 lbs or 10 lbs baby.\u00a0\u00a0Or does this mean I could go early?They will be calling me this week with another u/s appointment, so I will be asking 1. weight of baby, 2. cervical thickness, and is there anything else?Thank you ladies.",
