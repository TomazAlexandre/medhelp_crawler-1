            "answer": "Hun getting induced with GD depends on babies size and development (im 32 weeks and my boy is measuring 3-4 weeks ahead) The biggest concern now is bubs lungs, they are the last to mature fully, and if Dr's can they like to have bub baking as long as possible. Often times though 37 weeks plus is termed as full term. Are you on weekly appt. yet? When you see your Dr next, explain everything and he should have a way to make it easier or at least more manageable for you. The last thing anyone wants for you or bub is for things to get hard, stressful and spiral down wards. Your not alone the last few weeks are the hardest. Little sleep, worry, aches, pains and all the what ifs running through your mind are horrible. Hang in there and talk to your dr. Good luck xx",

            "answer": "Thanks, I saw my doc at 34 weeks and I see her again on this weds. She said last appointment that I was doing good on the diet cause my baby wasn't getting any bigger so she said see ya at 36 weeks I got an ultrasound this past weds that had her at 6lbs. Im hoping the 5 days I've felt like crap and have been eating bad won't effect things to much. Ill talk to her weds. Im hoping she will understand. She's very laid back and it drives me nuts so I hope she'll address my concerns.",

            "answer": "I have suffered GD with all 3 of my pregnancies, and unless baby is growing very large they won't induce you early. I was 37 giving birth to number 3 with GD and they weren't even considering inducing me! My bubs was only 5lb 13oz at 39 weeks! But, i fully understand how hard being on that diet is, it absolutely drove me insane, and i ended up getting quite depressed and emotional by week 37. It's hard when everyone is eating chocolates and chips, and even fries with dinner,and i had to settle for an apple or diet yogurt! I just focused on the fact is was all for the health of my baby, and i was so glad i kept to my diet cause when my bub was born they tested his glucose levels straight away, and if they were too low or too high the longer he had to stay in hospital and the special care nursery.",

It was a big wake up call to avoid the sugar.I think I just binged because I'm not used to limiting what I eat or have ever been good on a diet. I've only been on it for four weeks cause I found out at 32 after not knowingI've actually had it for 8 weeks maybe longer. Freaking doc screwed up on telling me. So I had already developed some bad eating habits that I have had to change.\u00a0\u00a0Oh well back on the diet wagon I go. No more binge eating for me.",

Lol!My diabetes specialist recommended that if I crave no-no's, like some chocolate, then to go and have one piece. She said one piece while you can control it is better than the craving building and you eat the whole block. Was great because she has been through GD with both of her pregnancies. So she does get where we are coming from, and doesn't judge.",

    "question": "I'm 36 weeks and I'm really starting to suffer mentally and physically. The diet I'm supposed to stick to is very hard considering I'm starting to get depressed. See I'm bipolar and have been doing ok but I'm reaching that time of year that my mood always shifts and I get depressed. So the diet, the pain I'm in from preterm labor on and off and the anxiety I feel is taking its toll on me. I'm concerned because I can't get on antidepressants till after the baby is born. I read that when you have gestational diabetes you will be induced by week 38. I'm hoping that's true for me cause I dont want to feel like this for much longer. I'm honestly stressed out with the anticipation of having my baby to especially with preterm labor symptoms that baffle me. All of this is just to much. Anyways dont you usually get induced with gestational diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I'm only measuring a week and a half ahead..my doctor says that's good..what do you think.",
