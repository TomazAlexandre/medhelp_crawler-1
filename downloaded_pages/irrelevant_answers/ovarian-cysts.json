            "answer": "Hi ThereI am going to repeat what I wrote to another young woman hereat age 18 , the main things you should do is set good health habits.work on getting yourself to your ideal body weightat 5'4'', ideal body weight is 120 lbsobesity is the leading cause of health problems - skeletal injury, pain, many cancers including breast, endometrial, and ovarian, heart disease,diabetes.working with your primary care for a diet and exercise program is the absolute single most important intervention you can doin addition I would say that bloating is a common symptom of depoprovera. It does not cause ovarian cystsHowever, you should ask your gynecologist who has examined you if she/he feels you should have any other intervention.However I cannot stress enough the correlation of obesity with pain as the extra weight puts a tremendous burden on your joints.Unfortunately America is having an epidemic of obesity and I do not think we are all working hard enough to fix it (less eating, more exercise)good luck and take care",

    "question": "Hi, im 18 years old 160 lbs (now 175 lbs) and have a fairly healthy lifestyle. For the past year, ive suffered with sharp shooting pains in my pelvis, and a sciatic like pain down my left buttock and leg. I frequently get pains in my lower back, and it always seem very tender and sore. My doctor told me i had sciatica in my left leg, and that it would go after 3 or 4 weeks on its own, but it hasnt, and im starting to think my symptoms are maybe that of a cyst/cysts on my ovary. I had the Depo-Provera contraception injection in january, and since that, my symptoms have become alot worse, and ive suffered with persistent bloating and weight gain. But im still unsure as this could be water retention due to the injection. I've heard this injection has been proven to cause ovarian cysts, is this true? I was just wondering, if someone could identify with my symptoms? And how i would go about getting a screening, as i am only 18?",
