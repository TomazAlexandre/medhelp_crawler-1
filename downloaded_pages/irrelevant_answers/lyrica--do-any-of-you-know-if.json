When I was taking it everyday I had some serious memory problems along with some unwanted weight gain, so I only take it when I get some flare ups. Like stated above Im one of those few who had some bad side effects, but still when the nerve pain gets bad I still turn to it regardless.",

It was like getting electrical shocks at different parts of your feet at spiratic voltages and places. The opiates didnt help with that kinda discomfort. I take pain pills for the dull droning, throbbing pain. I get no buzz from Lyrica.I take it only at bedtime as it makes me super sleepy. I have been on it for over a year and it works just the same as it did the first day I took it.",
