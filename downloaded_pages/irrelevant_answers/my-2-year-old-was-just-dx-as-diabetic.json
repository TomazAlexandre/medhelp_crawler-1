            "answer": "A diagnosis of Type 1 diabetes is always a shock and I can only imagine how hard it must be to have a child so young that you are responsible for. You have a lot to learn about controlling your son's diabetes and that is very stressful. What is important is to have an endo who you feel confident with who can help you with planning your son's insulin use. Other people on your \"team\"\u00a0\u00a0may include a certified diabetes educator or a dietician But what you will learn in time is that having a good team is only part of the picture. You will realize that you do a lot of adjusting of doses on your own on a daily basis. I highly recommend the book Using Insulin by John Walsh. It will help you with many of the things you need to know. The good thing about your son being so young is that he will be able to adjust to a change in diet more easily than an older child.If you want, send me a private message and I will give you the name of a website where you will be able to learn from and talk to many other diabetics and parents who have gone through the adjustment you will be going through. (I'm not allowed to include it on the forum).Your life (and your son's ) is going to change, and diabetes is going to become a big part of your lives. But the good news is that your son CAN do whatever he wants to do in his life even though he has type 1 diabetes, and can live a long and healthy life once you (and later he) learn how to manage his condition. Also, they are working on new treatments and towards a cure all the time, and I am confident that in your son's lifetime many things will improve. Hang in there, and remember to take care of yourselves as well through this stressful adjustment time.",
