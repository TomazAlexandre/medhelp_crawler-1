            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well if no cause is found in the eye like a squint, corneal ulcer, decrease in tears, dryness of eye, conjunctivitis, palpebral edema, stye, lacrimal sac infection, eye strain, refractive errors of eye like near or far sightedness etc, then it could be due to high BP, diabetes, thyroid problems or due to occulomotor nerve palsy. If you have diplopia due to third nerve or occulomotor palsy then consult an eye specialist or an optometrist to measure the angle of divergence of the visual axes. If this angle is large then you will have to patch up one eye till this angle lessens and then spectacles with horizontal or vertical prism can be used. If the angle is small then horizontal or vertical prism can help correct this. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi everyone. My five-month baby old scratched my eye four weeks ago leaving me with blurred double vision. I went to the optician who said that she had actually skewed the skin on the surface of the eyeball. He gave me fake tears to put in times a day and said it would heal in about a week. A week later it was no better so I went back. He said the scratch hadn't completely healed and to give it time.After three weeks I went to my GP who referred me to the hospital. I went there yesterday, did a bunch of tests and was told that the blurring is a bit of a mystery. In fact I have perfect 20-20 vision, with no scarring and no problems at the back of the eye.Does anyone else have a similar tale? And did it have a happy ending? I\u2019m finding driving a particular hazard.",
