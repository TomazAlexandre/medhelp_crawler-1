            "answer": "Hello FlJennWe are volunteers with a lot of experience in Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We're not medical professionals, so it's really important that you discuss specifics with your doc so s/he can work out a plan tailored to your needs.When we 'bottom out,' the fact is that we have a mismatch between the insulin on board and the insulin we need.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on the type of workout, a certified diabetes educator or endocrinologist will guide you to (1) increase the protein/carbo you eat prior to the workout (and/or during your workout) and/or (2) adjust your longacting/basal and/or your short-acting insulin for a period that might start before and/or continue a while after your workouts.Lots of 'and/or''s there because there are so many variables!The point is to achieve a safe balance.\u00a0\u00a0There are plenty of diabetics who maintain a vigorous exercise program (and it's recommended that we do!), so the best bet is to get yourself the training you need to customize your routine to better match your requirements.",

            "answer": "I have also struggled with this for some time.\u00a0\u00a0The key is to avoid the low in the first place by eating before your workout.\u00a0\u00a0But, if the low occurs, be sure to not over-treat it.\u00a0\u00a0I know when I am low (especially when exercising) I often eat/drink far too much and end up with a high.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if by working out you mean lifting weights, from personal experience I have learned that weight lifting often raises my blood sugar instead of lowering it.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore, if I were to do cardio first, causing the low, the treat the low, then lift weights, I would surely end up with a high.Just my 2 cents",
