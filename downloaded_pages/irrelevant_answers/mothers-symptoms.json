            "answer": "Hi Leeboorose.Well, perhaps I can make a bit easier for you.I have been through all this with my late mom, who passed 3 years ago.There's little doctors can do at this point, other than offer hope of slowing down the progression of her symptoms.One of the main culprits might be diminished uptake of glucose in the brain.Glucose is what fuels the brain. And there are not many substances which can go through the blood-brain barrier.Thanks to my own\u00a0\u00a0research on coconut oil, I managed to truly make a difference in my mom's last couple years of her life, before she passed.You see coconut oil is the probably the best alternative, when glucose isunavailable to supply energy to brain, one of the most energy demandingorgans.But it must be in ample quantity, added to her meals every single day!it's best if it one starts slow at 1-2 tablespoons a day and increase gradually to as high as 7-8 tablespoons within a month.It is also recommended to reduce carb intake in order to optimize results.Most meds have no effect on Dementia and Alzheimer's.FYI the 2 most prominent risk factors are hyperinsulinism and having the\u201csusceptibility gene\"\u00a0\u00a0ApoE4For more details go to the article \"Type 3 Diabetes: Metabolic Causes of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease\" in the Weston A Price Foundation website.I hope this helps,Niko",

    "question": "Hi, my mother is 73 and has been healthy except for some minor back issues and eye degeneration. In the last 5 months, her memory had gradually become worse, repeating questions, not recalling previous conversations, confusion, etc. She wakes everyday crying and panicked. It started gradually and used to get better in the afternoon but now it is all day crying. She now has a shuffle not a walk and is stooped over. Her mouth seems to twist up. She is in constant panic and has lost her old personality. She moves slowly. I think it is disease with dementia but I can't get into the doctor for a month. She is also falling often. Thank you.",
