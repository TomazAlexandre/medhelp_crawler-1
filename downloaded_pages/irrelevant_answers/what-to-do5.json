            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Losing Weight is possible only when your output is more than the input. Hence either your diet is not enough or what you eat is either metabolized very fast (as in hyperthyroidism) or is not absorbed properly (as in malabsorption syndrome). Diabetes is another reason for losing weight. A balance of carbohydrates, fats and proteins along with fresh fruits and vegetables, good source of calcium and iron should all be incorporated. The right quantity of each depends on the exercise level. Hence your coach is the best person to guide you. Besides this do consult your PCP once to rule out any disease.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I am 78. I was with a pharmaceuticals for 47 years on sales side. however I have been always advocate for alternative therapy like yoga, acupressure, shiatsu, Reikhi, and many others.Now i have come to one conclusion that all aternative therapies can be considered as priventive rathier than curative.If you change your life style and adopt some alternative therapy, it is a guranteed that you will have disease free life.But using most of the therapies as curative is almost waste. this is my personal experience.Till date I read a lot on ther therapies to search this illusive panacea. The above drug E.D.T.A appers to be one of the candidate for the utopian panacea.Please exuse all my errors as i am typing and reading with a magnifying glass because or Age related Macular Deterioration. I also have unexplainable tightness in my feet with constant companion Tinitus. Thanks. I am sure I will get an encouraging reply from you.",
