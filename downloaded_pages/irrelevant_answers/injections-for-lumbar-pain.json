            "answer": "If you have had an MRI or some other test that indicates exactly what is wrong I don't see why you would need any additional testing. As for the injections (transforaminal epidural steroid I assume your speaking of) it depends on your problem .... how much relief you obtain and how long it will last. My physician (Anesthesiologist) charged $660.00 for the injection itself. The consult before was around $200. The procedure was done in out patient surgery at a local hospital and that charge was about $2500. I had two injections (usual number) but you can have more than that but no more than 3 or so a year. I can't speak as to how long your relief might last ..... my problem was bilateral fractures of the pars and I got only a few days relief from each injection. I had to try all the conservative methods (including physical therapy) before I consulted the Neurosurgeon. It's a decision only you can make.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck .......",

            "answer": "I have been having lower back problems for 16 months. Had MRI results retrolisthesis @ L3 & L4, degenerative disease, bulging disk. I just completed my 2nd spinal injection. I have my first one in September 2006 2nd one December 2006. I only had relief from the first shot for about 4 weeks. The 2nd shot has not helped with the pain. I am considering back surgery. I am a diabetic and the neurosurgeon wanted me to try spinal injections due to the risks of surgery being a diabetic. I know I need to do something rather than continue with this pain. I am unable to do everyday things. I know there is no guarantee even with back surgery. Because of my immobility I continue to gain weight which causes problems with my diabetes and my back pain. I am 56 years old.",

            "answer": "I had the steroid shots. Fortunately I have insurance and I am grateful for that. I guess in situations like this the outcome is different for everyone. My immediate concern is having the surgery with the additional risk of being a diabetic. I know of several cases where the patient never recovered.",

    "question": "I have a herniated (L-5,s-1) disc.Ten yrs now and I am broke over it.No insurance.I am thinking about these injections and understand they will probably need a mri along with the fluoroscope and the cost of the injections themselves.I have not seen anything too promising yet as for their effectiveness and dont know that I should waste the money(maybe as much as 5 grand with the MRI) on these things.I dont want drugs and will surely have to have some surgery when I can find a way to cover the costs.Has anyone here had them?How lond did they last?What was the overall cost?I am 43 and at my wits end.Thanks.
