            "answer": "While I'm not very familiar with Tegradol, I did take Zoloft for 3 years when I was in my 20's(that was a long time ago and I have since switched medications)In that 3 years I did find Zoloft to be very effective. It's a good SSRI and I experienced no weight gain at all from it. I did have some sexual side effects from the Zoloft, but being young this was probably a good thing as my sexual drive was almost \"too strong\" and the Zoloft made it normal like most people.Wish I could tell you more about Tegradol, but that is one of the few meds I have never taken in my long battle with depression and anxiety.",

            "answer": "Have you been diagnosed Bipolar? Usually Tegratol is used as an atypical mood stabilizer, originally on the market for seizures. Zoloft is a good drug, but I have to say, my own personal experience is that it's didn't help me keep the weight off, but there are so many variables.\u00a0\u00a0You are in a precarious position due to your other medical conditions. I recommend you sit down with your GP regarding these drugs. You have to be vigilant anyways due to Diabetes and checking your blood sugars, you can easily catch anything earlier. Zoloft, if you need to get off the drug is much easier the Cymbalta by miles.If you doctor is telling you to take the meds, I would recommend it, but I would investigate the drugs as well. Both have been on the market for an extended period of time, and many studies have been done.\u00a0\u00a0I always check online information regarding a medication before I take it, as well, I ask my doctor questions when I am there. It's very important to be a well educated consumer.",

            "answer": "My error, I do see you were diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0Normally when BP you are going to have at least, and I mean at least 2 drugs on board for your treatment. The combination you are is a long standing combination of meds but not first choice. Did you get diagnosed by your GP or your psych?\u00a0\u00a0Cymbalta is generally not a good choice for BP, as it can cause hypo/mania and serious anxiety. Zoloft isn't bad, I think, and I may be wrong, the reason why they've moved you to that drug, may be to wean you off the Cymbalta, and eventually get you off the SSRI's altogether. I was told that if the MS, mood stabilizers don't work enough , a ssri might be brought on board. In your case with your other health issues, these drugs may be you best option, especially because you have HepC.There is also a bipolar community here as well, which I am on as well. Check it out. The most important thing is to educate yourself well, you are the leader in your own path to being mentally stable. .",
