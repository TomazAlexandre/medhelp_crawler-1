            "answer": "Well I don't know anything about diabetes and actually it sounds like a doctor would be the best person to ask this of - we DO tend to have a lot of trouble eating while on treatment and lose a lot of weight. If he has the type of diabetes that you get from being over weight this might help out tremendously (trying to find a silver lining).I do find that it is very possible to live and eat a much healthier lifestyle than I used to and the things that I avoid are friend which really hurt my stomach now and I eat a lot more fruit and yogurt than I used to.A good doctor would be able to advise you on how to coordinate both things into one healthy treatment.I'm sure someone with some real knowledge will come in and give you some advice but for now i wanted to say best of luck, we are not doctors in here but are all patients who can speak from experience (something most doctors sure can't)",

            "answer": "Hello, I am Type II diabetic and currently on treatment for HepC. I take Lantus insulin and time-release metformin (Glucophage) as I did before my HepC diagnosis and starting HepC treatment last summer. You did not mention if your hubby is currently being treated for HepC. My primary care doctor and gastroenterologist both told me simply to eat a moderate and balanced diet as usual and avoid supplements with iron. I take a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement without iron.You might want to check with a diabetes educator/nutritionist who is also familiar with HepC and the challenges the disease and treatment imposes on the liver. The liver secretes glucose into the bloodstream, thus is quite involved with blood sugar levels. Initially I wondered whether taking metformin (which actually slows the liver's glucose secretion processes) might overtax my already compromised liver. I was told by both doctors that it would not. Some of us feel nauseous and lose our appetites from treatment meds and lose weight during treatment. For some diabetics it is a good thing to lose weight, but surely not to extremes. I was nauseous during the first few weeks but have gained about 6-8 lbs since starting treatment eight months ago. My blood sugar levels have wavered some during treatment but have not been too far out of whack. For me, lack of exercise has probably been a bigger challenge than eating poorly. I have hope that successfully treating my HepC may make my diabetes easier to control. Good luck to you. Be sure to find some professionals and ask lots of questions!- Lee",

            "answer": "Hi Marso, I can relate too well to your husband's craving for sweets. I too get that way but most of the time I will resist the urge. Sometimes I chew Dentyne Fire Spicy Cinnamon gum and I will chew a whole pack in less than an hour and then I might chew some more. It's sugarless but does have 1 gram of carb per piece so a pack of 12 pieces is less than what we diabeteics call 1 gram of carbs. I'm sure you know that diabtics call 15 grams of carbohydrates 1 carb. I don't know your husband's condition but I'll tell you mine and how I control my diabetes and hopefully you'll get some ideas. Fist here are my stats: 1)I'm not overweight 2)My triglycerides are normal 3)My cholestterol is around 100 so it's low. I use insulin to control my glucose. I use Humulin N twice a day a a source of basal insulin. In case you don't know, basal insulin is aimed at controlling the fasting glucose. I think of it like a trickle charger for a battery - it sort of trickels just enough insulin into the system to control the glucose level until you eat. Bolus insulin is like a burst of insulin that controls insulin when carbohydrates are consumed. I use Humalog (lispro insulin) which takes as little as 15 minutes to take effect and is pretty much done working at 2 hours. I use this just before I eat any meal and adjust dose according to the carbs that I will be ingesting. Bear in mind that I am a liver transplant recipient and though I could control my glucose with oral meds I chose insulin for 2 reasons: 1)While on interferon I couldn't eat much at all so I was getting hypoglycemic frequently due to a lack of carb intake when I was on oral meds. 2)The oral meds either stimulate the pancreas or inhibit the liver and I didn't think that fooling with my organs was the way to go. As it is I eat just about anything I want and cover it with Humalog. I stay away from sweets as a rule and I don't eat a lot of bread but I eat pasta once in a while if I want. I watch my fruit intake and try to eat a lot of vegetables. I am very tightly controlled and if my post prandial glucose is over 150 I am not happy with it. I like it to be 140 after meals if I can achieve that. That's about it for how I control my diabetes. If you have any questions post them and I'll watch for you. I wish you good luck and I hope I've helped a bit. Mike",

And as you adviced we bought a pack of sugarfree chewing gums to chew whenever he crave for sweets. even though sometimes he used to drink tea with a half teaspoon of diet sugar.Thanks again for your advice Mike u've been such a good person who took time posting those usefull advice!!!
