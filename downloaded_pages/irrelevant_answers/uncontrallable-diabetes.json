One, the type of foods your dad consumes, two; consuming sugary foods and sugary liquids and bad carbs.You dad my want to get an insulin test to see if his pancreas is producing the correct amount of insulin at the needed time. A Thyroid disorder and liver disorders can disrupt insulin levels too. Go to the doctor and have these test performed.",

            "answer": "I am a type 2 diabetic and 48yrs old. One way of controlling the diet is to have a number of light meals throughout the day. For example eat small quantity of food every 2 hours. This is one way to blunt the increase in glucose levels. Another means of keeping sugar level in control is to powder methi seeds and have 1 spoon early in the morning before breakfast.Try out this and give me a feedback. By this i have been able to control my sugar levels.",
