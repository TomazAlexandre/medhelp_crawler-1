            "answer": "Ursamere,It might be time to get a referral to a CDE (certified diabetes educator) when you talk to your doc about \"how low is too low\" again.\u00a0\u00a0I mention this because if you have trouble going 2-3 hours without going too low, your meds may well need to be adjusted.Our needs change over time and if our medication and eating doesn't change at the same time, we can end up running too low or too high for too long.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if now is the time for you to re-evaluate your routine with your doc and/or CDE.Even as a longtime diabetic, I learn (and re-learn what I've forgotten) when I make the time to talk to the pros again about the daily issues ...Good luck.",

    "question": "In fasting for a Cholesterol test, what happens when blood sugar gets too low?\u00a0\u00a0Will 2 or 3 glucotablets ruin the test?My doctor insists on at least 3 hours fast before the blood test, if my glucose level is too low to drive safely it's a waste anyway.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have the answer?\u00a0\u00a0(I won't do an overnight fast, had problems at the lab last time with low blood sugar - my husband was driving - thank goodness).",
