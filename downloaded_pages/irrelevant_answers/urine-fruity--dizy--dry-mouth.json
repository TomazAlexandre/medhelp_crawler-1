            "answer": "Start searching on-line for your symptoms. Learn what the possibilities are. Check outCelia Desease, Gluten intolerance (wheat,barley,rye and oats). Whisky is made from wheat. Gluten is addictive. It is not just the alcohol that is addictive. You could switch to wine (red wine is healthier, I think). I don't know about vodka, I don't know if it is madewith some form of gluten. There are other types of alcohol that are not made with gluten, check them out.You have to illiminate gluten from your daily food intake also... Not an easy thing to dobut if you feel bad enough you have to start trying things. If you are on your way to being diabetic you are in trouble. Gluten is in almost everything that is processed and it will keep you going back for all the boose, the bread, the pasta etc... It keeps your appetite going strong, it is addictive.\u00a0\u00a0Start eating more green veggies and veggies of any kind. Include fruit in your daily diet and protien. You have to make some dietary/nutritional consessions. You have to do it. Give your self a brake and slowly ( or quickly ) include more and more of the better foods in your life and eventually you will begin to prefer the better choices. Try and relax about it, don't stress out over it, try to have some fun with it, just keep trying to improve your daily nutrition.Good Luck and better health",

You should not put this off. It is better to know for sure if the alcohol is causing \"it\". It could be many things. What you need is a good health professional to help you work through the health issues in spite of your \"bad habbits\". Your habbits can change and most likely will as you gravitate towards feeling better.\u00a0\u00a0The bleeding could be something simple like hemorrhoids.Check out the bleeding.",
