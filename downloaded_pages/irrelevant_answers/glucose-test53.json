Are you measuring ahead or bigger??? Is this your first baby???",

            "answer": "OK 1 I'm so sorry to hear about your first!!! And your in the same boat I am ..the chances for women during a second pregnancy to fail the test are higher and so is the chance of getting gestational diabetes. Its just something with our hormones that cause our insulin to be blocked. Dont worry though if you do get it , it goes away after birth and chances of the baby having any issues is low as long as you follow the diet or exercise plan they give you. Right now all my numbers are low and normal, I've been measuring ahead since 24 weeks about\u00a0\u00a0a week and 2 days ...but on a serious note don't stress and do research it helped me a lot and I wish I would have done it before my 3 hour cuz I was a ball of nerves...",
