            "answer": "Most doctors won't do another ultrasound till about 15-20 weeks. That's when they will do the anatomy ultrasound. I never had the diabetes so I can't say if that changes when you get the ultrasound they normally do a blood test at 16 weeks for diabetes then again at 28 weeks an if either come back abnormal they will have you do a 3 hour blood test.\u00a0\u00a0Wish you the best of luck an welcome to the club haha",
