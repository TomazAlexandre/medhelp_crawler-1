            "answer": "No medication will help your husband unless he helps himself first. Diet and moderate exercise play a large role in controlling diabetes and has been discussed many times on this forum. Take the time to read through previous posts for there are a lot of good sound suggestions, including links to web sites on how to manage/control diabetes. Its important too that your husband keeps the glucose at a steady level. Large spikes and dips should be avoided.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Some people have developed a life-threatening condition called lactic acidosis while taking metformin. Get emergency medical help if you have any of these symptoms of lactic acidosis: weakness, increasing sleepiness, slow heart rate, cold feeling, muscle pain, shortness of breath, stomach pain, feeling light-headed, and fainting.I am not saying this is whats wrong however I think you should be aware of these things listed.I would call the doctor if he gets worse.......I would call anyway!",

            "answer": "I felt like that too, it is the normal symptoms of diabetes until it is under control. I was so frustrated because of the lack of energy, I thought it was a life sentence. I had the same problems until recently I did a ten day master cleanse. It has completely sorted out my energy and now I have bags to spare. I am now on day 17 of a new cleanse that I intend to do for forty days. I feel amazing, I have gutted the house, my work has improved and even sex is better as I have the energy. I would research it before he does it but I would highly recommend it. It isn't just for diabetics either. You should try it yourself, if you did it with him it would show your commitment to him and help. My girlfriend did it with me and we were there to help each other and it has given me back my life. I am now excited about the future and am raving about the cleanse to everyone, especially diabetics.Best wishes",

    "question": "My fianc\u00e9 as just recently been diagnosed with type two diabetes in January. He was originally talking two 500 mg metformin and one long insulin shot a day. Now he is just talking two 1000 mg of metformin a day. He is worried because he does not feel the same way he used too. He says he is alway tired and that interferes with work, sports, playing with our son and even sex. What are the side effects of metformin? Are taking the pills making him exsosted all the time? If it is not the pill what could be making him feel this way. If anyone else has experianced this can you please share you story with me.",
