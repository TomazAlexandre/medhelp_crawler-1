            "answer": "Hello,Without examination,it is very difficult to confirm a diagnosis,but the various possibilities for your symptoms are dermatitis,Eczema,sweat dermatitis,fungal infectionsand hives. Internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders,diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals,wool,soaps,cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can also cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Application of calamine lotion and a mild steroid cream like dermacort will also help in providing relief.Pls take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist. He/She will start with the specific medications. If an internal disease is found, whether it's kidney disease, iron deficiency or a thyroid problem or a fungal infection treating that disease often relieves the itch.Lastly,Phototherapy can also be tried.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing or\u00a0\u00a0if you have any additional queries.",

            "answer": "sounds like hives to me. Neither psoriasis or eczema would itch all over. Hives forms bumps and itches all over. Stress and allergic reactions cause them.Look for a pic online.Dermatologist label everything as eczema. If you go to one, go to a university.I spent over a year being tortured by medications given to me by so called doctors. Four said it was eczema four were 100% wrong. When I finally went to a real doctor, he fixed the problem in a week!",

    "question": "I have itchy skin all over my body accompanied by small bumps in some places, and big ones on others... The main areas are my armpits, forearms, knee-pits (yeah...), groin/upper thigh, and ankles. The itching is unbearable. There is no overly noticeable skin rash except for a few very small bumps at each site.\u00a0\u00a0I first thought, \"okay great, I've got genital warts.\"\u00a0\u00a0But there are no bumps actually on my genitals, and they're all over the place.The stress I have with everything is enough to bring on some serious chronic conditions. But I'm a 24 year old male... I should be at the prime of my life. I'm physically fit and my diet is pretty darn good, though it could always use work.What going on with me?? Is it some form of psoriasis? I have had past struggles with thos who practice conventional medicine, but I'm hearing that nagging voice in my head that tells me I am in need of some kind of \"diagnosis\" as if that would fix everything... I am weary of typical diagnoses that involve a cream and a pill.What am I facing here?Any advice?",
