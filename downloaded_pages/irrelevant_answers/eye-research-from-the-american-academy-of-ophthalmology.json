After adjusting for confounding factors, diabetes mellitus (35 percent increased hazard) and systemic arterial hypertension (17 percent increased hazard) were found to be independently associated with OAG. Subjects with both conditions had a 48 percent increased risk compared to subjects with neither condition. Subjects with hyperlipidemia alone had a 5 percent reduced risk, while the increased hazard of OAG associated with DM and HTN were attenuated by the presence of hyperlipidemia. Ophthalmology, July 2011Nonagenarians appear at no greater risk of cataract surgery complications than octogenariansThis retrospective analysis compared outcomes between nonagenarians and octogenarians who underwent cataract surgery at the U.S. Veterans Health Administration over a two-year period. Rates of intraoperative and postoperative complications were similar. At 90 days, 13.5 percent of octogenarians experienced complications compared with 13.4 percent of nonagenarians (P = 0.9001). Most nonagenarians lived for at least one year after surgery. The authors call for more study of other outcome parameters, such as visual function and quality of life. Ophthalmology, July 2011UK study finds anti-VEGF-related safety incidents rare, but increasingInvestigators reviewed all anti-VEGF-related safety incidents reported to a national incident reporting database in England and Whales between 2003 and 2010. Of 166 incidents reported \u2013 which increased every year since anti-VEGF introduction in 2006 \u2013 the most common causes were intra-ocular inflammation/endophthalmitis (16), treatment or follow-up delays (45), wrong medication (26), wrong eye/patient injection (17). Of the 16 cases endophthalmitis cases reported, two were associated with bevacizumab and 14 with ranibizumab. The authors call for more rigorous infection control measures, and more patient safety reporting in the anti-VEGF era. Eye, published online, April 2011Intra-arterial chemotherapy can be effective in advanced retinoblastomaResearchers report on their four-year experience treating 78 patients with advanced unilateral or bilateral retinoblastoma with intra-arterial (IA) chemotherapy. Kaplan-Meier estimates of ocular event free (enucleation or radiotherapy) survival rates at two years were 70 percent for all eyes, 81.7 percent in eyes receiving IA chemotherapy as primary treatment, and 58.4 percent for eyes that previously failed intravenous chemotherapy and/or external beam radiation (EBR) therapy. For group V eyes, the event-free survival rate was 66.5 percent for all eyes, 80.5 percent for those receiving IA chemotherapy as primary treatment, and 51.5 percent for those previously treated with intravenous chemotherapy and/or EBR therapy. No permanent extraocular complications were observed. Archives of Ophthalmology, June 2011Patients on warfarin therapy appear at no increased risk for vitrectomy complicationsThis retrospective, case-control study compared outcomes between 60 patients who continued warfarin therapy during the surgical period with patients not on any type of anti-coagulant therapy. While significantly more patients in the warfarin group presented with vitreous hemorrhage associated with rhegmatogenous retinal detachment, they didn\u2019t suffer more perioperative or postoperative complications from vitrectomy compared with controls. The authors believe the risks of stopping warfarin are greater than the perceived benefit of reduced complications, and don\u2019t recommend stopping treatment before vitrectomy.
