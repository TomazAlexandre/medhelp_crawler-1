            "answer": "I would recommend finding yourself a really good endocrinologist who is versed in treating thyroid issues & trust me not all of them do; many of them only treat diabetes (I found out the hard way).\u00a0\u00a0There is a thing called \"subclinical hypothyroidism\" as well as \"subclinical hyperthyroidism\" (which is what I had prior to my thyroidectomy).\u00a0\u00a0That is when your labs are \"normal\" or \"near normal\" but yet have symptoms indicative of the problem.\u00a0\u00a0In this case I find it really important to find an endo that looks at the whole picture and not just the numbers; it is a big frustration among thyroid patients that some doctors diagnose and adjust meds simply on lab values and don't take symptoms into consideration.\u00a0\u00a0It may be true that your thyroid is starting to peter out a little as you reach middle age but that shouldn't be a reason not to treat if you are symptomatic (in my own opinion).\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully you'll be able to find an endo that will be able to help you come to a decision that you are comfortable with.",

    "question": "As a 46 y.o. healthy male, I believe I've had symptoms of hypothyroidism for 5+ years. I have a sister diagnosed as hypo. & father on synthroid due to prior pituitary tumor removal & treatment. My recent TSH was 2.975, & Free T4 1.12 . Symptoms I've had are mild cold interolerance, mild depression symptoms, tiredness, irritability, poor short term memory, low libido, & lower motivation/drive than in prior years. While most of these are symptoms of hypo., they're also quite common among people without hypo. (& aging \"boomers\"), I assume.What's reasonable to do as a next step? Monitor the TSH over time (to determine trend & variability), or try treatment (Synthroid, etc.) to see if symptoms abate?What constitutes TSH normal range seems to be quite a controversial topic...Thanks much, in advance...",
