    "question": "I noticed lately i will eat breakfast then lunch and sometimes i wont eat dinner for about 4 hours or so. I all of sudden get really dizzy and feel like im about to faint, i shake really bad and sweat. I feel just awful! Then when i drink some water, eat peanut butter crackers and a fruit cup i start to feel better. I mean i really almost passed out a few times. I remember having those problems in high school and a lil after but it wasnt this bad. Thats also because i didnt eat much to begin with. I eat alot now. Is that diabetes or blood sugar problems? Or just pregnancy? Thanks :) Also, have you noticed you get dehydrated faster when your pregnant? It seems like i never drink enough water...I had my blood sugar checked wed but i still have to wait for the results.",
