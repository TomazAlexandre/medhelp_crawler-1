            "answer": "I have read that cloudy urine after dairy is common.\u00a0\u00a0It has something to do with calcium phosphate crystals from the extra calcium in dairy parcipitating in your urine.\u00a0\u00a0It is harmless.\u00a0\u00a0Surf the net and check it out.\u00a0\u00a0I currently have issues with slightly turbid urine.\u00a0\u00a0My urine gets cloudy after strenous exercise (I run 4 to 7 miles a day) also, it seems to always look like there are tiny particles suspended in it.\u00a0\u00a0If you have time, check out my post from earlier today and let me know if you have any insight.Hope you feel better soon,Turtle",

    "question": "So I saw my Dr today. He seemed very confused about the fact I only have cloudy urine after eating dairy.He did a dip stick test, and everything was normal, except ketones. There was a slight detection of ketones. He said it likely wasnt diabetes, because there was no sugar in my urine.I hadnt eaten in like 16 hours, and he said that could have caused it.I was sent for another urine test at a lab, and should get results tomorrow.Does this sound worrisome? Or does the fact I hadnt eatin in 16 hours sound like the culprit?Should I still be concerned with the dairy causeing cloudy urine? He really didnt seem concerned. Just said hopefully it wont cause kidney stones.Anyone have a take on this?",
