    "question": "My mom was diagnosed as a diabetic when she was 51. She is now 78 years old and for the past few years has had an occasional bad cough where she can barely talk. She also has developed high blood pressure which she didn't have in the past.\u00a0\u00a0Currently, she is complaining of a \"fullness\" and not feeling like eating.\u00a0\u00a0Up to this point she has been pretty spunky and healthy but is just having these problems lately. She takes insulin shots and her sugar levels are pretty constant at present, but in the past they were very up and down.\u00a0\u00a0She hasn't been hospitalized much, but this year she was in the hospital for shortness of breath (which they never really found the source of) and she sometimes has to sleep sitting up if the shortness of breath returns. Thanks for any light you can shed on this and for helping us.",
