            "answer": "Sorry to say but teaching a child that diabetes is a long term disease is a difficult task. A friend of mine has her son of 7 years old with diabetes on an insulin pump. It is a constant battle to keep him up to speed on every thing he has to do. But by the parent helping to monitor with the child helps to keep him from any false reports. i understand how difficult this must be to a child as many adults don't adjust well. One time seeing an Endocrinologist at the VA, i use the VA medical center for my care, seeing her for the first time and i gave her my blood sugar results she told me it was fantastic and i said because of my gastroparesis my blood sugars go up or down. And she said i at least reported what they were and this would help her to find solutions to my problem and i was different than her type 2 patients who wrote perfect results in their record books and then had their A1C tell a different story. i told her the advice my first doctor gave me and this was back all they had was urine testing that i should write down every test, good or bad, as they can't solve a problem if they don't know about it.But i can't help but wonder if some psychological counseling might help with the problem. At least bring it up with her endocrinologist at the next appointment.good luck, bret",

            "answer": "I agree with BL and am a long time diabetic, myself.\u00a0\u00a0I'd like to offer another perspective also.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a physician.THe language associated with diabetes is very intimidating to a child and even \"pushes buttons\" for teen and adults.\u00a0\u00a0One of the challenges of diabetes mgt is to focus enough on food to teach good choices, portion control, etc.\u00a0\u00a0A traditional but terrible approach, in my opinion, is to create a list of allowed & disallowed foods.\u00a0\u00a0Almost by definition, a person who's told repeated they cannot have \"X\" may build up a yearning to see what \"X\" is all about.A much healthier approach that works even with muchkins is to begin to teach options and tradeoffs.\u00a0\u00a0IF this child loves cookies, for example, create a meal plan that allows her to have cookies and teach her that, for example, a healthy meal can include a few cookies along some lower carb foods to create a healthy balance.\u00a0\u00a0Change the language from motivating \"cheat\" to motivating \"treat.\"\u00a0\u00a0The difference is secrecy and lying, etc.A child's brain isn't developed well enough to really grasp long term consequences and they relate much better to short term goals & rewards.\u00a0\u00a0The foster parents are doing a great job focusing on the techniques, the science, and medication.\u00a0\u00a0Now it's time to focus on this child as a whole person with emotional & psychological needs pertaining to diabetes.Almost all children will go thru a defiance stage, but that more often begins in adolescence when they are supposed to be defining themselves as separate from their parents.\u00a0\u00a0This child is clearly in need of counseling -- she's been thru a lot for a munchkin:\u00a0\u00a0diabetes dx, some neglect by her parents, separation from her parents, adjusting to foster parents.\u00a0\u00a0Love, support, professional counseling, encouragement & shifting the language from \"compliance\" issues to engaging her in choices can all help.\u00a0\u00a0Also encourage her foster parents to get involved with their local chapter of JDRF where this munchkin can meet other kids and not feel so terribly alone & differnt from her peers.",

    "question": "I am a case manager for an 11 year-old girl with Type I diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She was diagnosed several years ago, but her health was poorly managed by her biological parents.\u00a0\u00a0Her foster parents have worked hard to maintain the child's healthy, and have done a wonderful job, but the child often tries to sneak food.\u00a0\u00a0Recently she was caught falsly reporting her blood sugar readings at school in order to get extra snacks and to get out of class.\u00a0\u00a0She has caused her blood sugar levels to go out of control more than once as a result of this behavior.\u00a0\u00a0She is a \"low Functioning\" child, so her emotional and mental age is actually a few years younger than 11.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any way to help her understand that what she is doing is terrible for her body?",
