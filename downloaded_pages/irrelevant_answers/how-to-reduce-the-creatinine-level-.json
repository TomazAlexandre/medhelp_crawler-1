            "answer": "I think Paranayam helps! try Kapal Bhati at a slow speed and with lighter strokes. Kapal Bhati should essentially be followd by agnisaar ( 3 to 5 times) and Anulom vilom, the durtion of anulom vilom should never be less than the time spent on Kapal Bhati. Kapalbhati should have strokes not exceeding 60 in one minute, with the practice it should be done for 30 min. ( Kapal Bhati and anulom vilom) total 60 min.",

            "answer": "I would recommend consulting with a kidney dietician. High sodium diets with high protein and dairy foods can over work kidneys already overworking due to impaired functionality. Food can either be our medicine, or our poison. Anything to reduce the extra workload of the kidneys is beneficial!!! I wish you both well!!",
