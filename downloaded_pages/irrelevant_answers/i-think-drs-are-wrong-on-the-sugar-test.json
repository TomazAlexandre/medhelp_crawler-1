They measure if your body is evenly distributing it through your body over a specified period of time. After a certain period of time based on your previous blood pressure they can tell roughly how diluted the sugar should come back when they read your blood and thats how they know. Good luck momma.",

You shouldn't easy cinnamon iced huny buns and expect to pasS haha but you don't fat few doctors make you fast it's not necessary. If you don't pass it is bc you have gd. Not nc they overloaded you on sugar which I think is fn stupid and unhealthy to start with but that's the way to test. If you fail after the hour it's bc your body is not functioning correctly and controlling your sugar hence gd. Before test avoid starches bread, pastas etc, juice, and anything sugary. Then you should pas unless you do have gd. That is what my nurse practitioner told me to do as my next appt I will be doing my test. Last pregnancy I failed 1 hr bc I ate at olive garden and are a bunch of carbs. Passed my 3 hr test though. Lol",

It will surely be high; adding the fact that I had took bread and mike as my breaskfast. I wish they just evaluated you without giving you that cup!
