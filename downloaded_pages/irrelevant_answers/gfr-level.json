            "answer": "Your Creatinine is with in the normal while your Target GFR (with one Kidney) should be around 80-90/mL/min/1.73^2 (normal >90). Estimated GFR for you will be around 53-69/mL/min/1.73^2 (considering that you are less than 75 years of age (60) and you are not African American,weighing around-75kgs).The eGFR values (only ranges but not absolute) are calculated according to a formula for eGFR Cockroft-Gault, Mayo Quadratic using CKD-EPI and using MDRD,6 Variable (mentioned below)\u00a0\u00a0This formula estimates the target levels of GFR in CKD subjects (Chronic Kidney Disease),while your values of Creatinine-1.3 mg/dl and GFR-47 fall under category of CKD Stage-III.GFR can be calculated using various formulas and various tests to estimate the range of Kidney Function. But values like 24 hr Urine output measures, Creatinine Clearance, Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) , Albumin (urine) Albumin (serum), weight, Age,Gender, Race,Serum Electrolytes, Uric Acid. These readings are important (at least 4 of them) to calculate your exact Target GFR (with one Kidney).But since the other investigations show no other abnormalities,it is indeed a good news which is not really so severe but GFR 47 fall under CKD Stage-III despite of how many kidney present.But still to solve further deterioration of Kidney Function and your other systemic conditions you\u00a0\u00a0need intervention with a Nephrologist and a Urologist or a Dialysis Specialist so that your Target GFR is achieved either through medications like Diuretics or Dialysis (not strictly prompted without examination and investigations).So please give all other history related to your problem and we could help to give you information about care to be taken.God Bless!",
