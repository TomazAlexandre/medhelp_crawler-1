            "answer": "Try going back to the clinic. Ask them about your results.Sometimes they forget to call people back. Did you do a fasting test? Or was it random?Have you tried taking several small meals a day instead of 1 - 3 meals a day?Have you had your ears checked? Your sinuses? These can both cause those feelings as well.Don't give up hope!You could always buy a test kit at a drugstore and check for yourself as well.Good luck!",

    "question": "I am 41 male living in London and getting dizzy when driving around two hours I was getting lessons for driving test and now I am little confused don't know what to do cause I got this symptom for awhile and don't know is it worth to even try to carry on cause what kind of a driver will I become if I can't drive more than two hours, who will give me a job? this really makes me sad.. I noticed the same symptom if I work long hours like more than 8 hours a day but with the driving it comes much quicker.. I guess it has something to do with the sugar in blood but recently I have done blood test through my GP practice and nobody told me that I had a diabetes or something like this.. I have done blood test for sugar last year with different practice as well but nobody contacted me then either. I would b delighted if somebody can explain my problem really thanks..",
