            "answer": "Some women go from not dilated at all to delivering within a few hours. So don't assume you'll have to be induced (even if you've scheduled it with your doctor) just because you haven't dilated yet.Sometimes doctors choose to manually dilate, which is more natural than something like cervadil. Cervadil is a pill inserted inside your vagina to help you soften up and dilate. A bulb or balloon is inserted instead sometimes which slowly inflates to help you dilate and falls out I think when you reach a six.Those methods can be painful to insert but typically lead to natural labours. Sometimes though, the Dr will decide to start a pitocen drip in addition to what you already have. In this case, the pitocen can cause contractions far stronger than natural labor, which also leads to it being more painful. If this is given to you, ask if you can have the drip turned off when you reach a certain dilation to see if your labor will continue on its own. If so, great! If not, it's not too hard to start the drip up again.",

            "answer": "Im hoping to be able to do it without being induced I really want an all natural birth. And I'm not sure what kind of induction technique this doctor uses. So thank you hopefully baby will come before the induction but not to early",

I don't want to be induced at all. But because of preexisting diabetes I have to be induced at 39 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0He won't allow me to go farther then that. Im hoping my little bean helps me out in this one",
