            "answer": "HelloI would like to be helpful but I need more information. All test are interpreted best in the context of the whole picture. Why did you have the test? Why did you have five? Have you had an EKG before.These findings may be consistent with ischemia or poor blood flow in that inferior and lateral distribution but without more information it's difficult to say",

            "answer": "The EKG was my first and done as part of a free work-up. I have not even thought about being symptomatic. The MD overseeing the screening immediately sent me to my family DR. He repeated the EKG to be sure and was sent straight to the ER and am none the wiser. My Cardiac enzymes were negative. My thyroid level was a little low but, other than that nothing. I am to repeat every thing again in 3 days. In the mean time I am told to keep quiet and not worry. And to the question of why five EKGs; each was repeated as soon as the DR. reviewed them as I am only 24. I do have a congenital defect of the heart\u00a0\u00a0on my mothers side of the family but don't know much about it.",

            "answer": "I see. That's actually on of the potential problems of screening people who are highly unlikely to have any degree of the disease that you're looking for. In\u00a0\u00a0your case, it is probably some normal variant for you that has nothing to do with coronary ischemia. Do you have high cholesterol, hypertension, diabetes. Family history of heart attack or stroke?In some people, it is a common variant to have an isolated t wave in lead III or AVF.Are you scheduled to see a cardiologist? Good luck. I think it will be a normal variant for you.",

            "answer": "just to clarify the brothers were my uncles (father's brothers).I repeated an EKG today, it showed no flip t-waves but, just to be sure the Dr. wants me to do an ECHO. I have always had heart palpitations which could be felt by another person (my mother when I was small). I've always thought of it as normal to have palpitations and just thought they were nerves. I do lose feeling in my legs and arms some times mostly legs but have never thought much about it.",
