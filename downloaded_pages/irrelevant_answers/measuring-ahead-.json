They weren't sure on my due date because I was on the pill and didn't get regular periods, then at my anatomy u/s they changed my due date two weeks later! I always wondered if the original due date could have actually been accurate,\u00a0\u00a0but they said they take a lot more into consideration than just size.",

            "answer": "Big babies are great, they sleep better! Also, ultrasound measurements get less accurate the further along you are. So many people are encouraged to induce earlier (which can lead to more complications in birth) simply due to a late ultrasound that says their baby is 10 pounds. After they're put through intense artificial labour (or induction) and meet their nice little average 8 pounder they wonder what all the stupid fuss was about. And btw I had a 10 pounder for my first. Easy as pie. If by pie you mean 42km marathon. But I still enjoyed the birth :)",
