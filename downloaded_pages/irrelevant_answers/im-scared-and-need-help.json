Ive read that sometimes HIV screening doesnt always give u accurate results it can even take years so keep checking yourself if you know ur in danger of it. Also ur body can make u believe wot ur mind is terrified of. Please get tested and update us! I pray that ur clear IJN. Xx",

If you really believe that you're sick and start looking for symptoms then you well find them. Try to relax all this stress isn't good for you or your baby. Request a second test for both you and your partner. I hope all works out well.",

He could have the flu. Or pneumonia. I think HIV makes you lose weight and get very thin because your body starts shutting down and you said he's gaining weight. And you're not losing it either. Gaining weight, dizzy and tingly hands could be type 2 diabetes. And yor symptoms sound like they could just be from pregnancy and your toe nails could just be a fungus of some sort. Alot of people get weird symptoms during pregnancy for instance my mom told me she got warts on her hands meanwhile she had never had a wart in her life. I'm not a doctor but I wouldn't freak out too much!",
