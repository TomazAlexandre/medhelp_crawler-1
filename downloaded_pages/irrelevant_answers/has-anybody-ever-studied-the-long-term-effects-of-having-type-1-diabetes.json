    "question": "i am an insulin dependent diabetic for the last forty years. My diet is healthy, I am active ( I exercise at least twice a week for more than an hour at a time), my eyesight is good (no laser treatment yet), test my blood sugar levels at least 7 times every day, take 4 shots of insulin every day. Basically i do what i should do as a diabetic most of the time. I am very interested to find out if anyone, anywhere has ever studied the psychological effect a long term illness such as Type 1 diabetes, has on the patient and there families. Looking forward to hearing some replies. Thank you for taking the time to read this.",
