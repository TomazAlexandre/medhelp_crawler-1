            "answer": "Most doctors won't schedule you another U/S, some do a routine growth scan at the end, but most don't unless there's something wrong or you're having medical issues.

He told me so far it look like a girl so buy pink but save the receipts. Now when me and my husband looks a the sonogram that says \"looks like a girl\" it looks like my lil girl could be a boy. Before I became pregnant I had dreams of a boy and so did family members and friends. So me and my husband are waiting for another sonogram to confirm the first but I don't know when the second sonogram is suppose to be taken.",
