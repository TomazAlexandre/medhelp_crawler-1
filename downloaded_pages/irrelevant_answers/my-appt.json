    "question": "So my uterus is measuring two weeks ahead because I have excessive amniotic fluid around baby. . Most likely because I have pregnancy diabetes. So I'm waiting for my glucose test results and they are going to monitor my fluid levels in 3 weeks... so I get to see baby again! Yay.\u00a0\u00a0Pray I passed the test,\u00a0\u00a0but I have a gut feeling I didn't :( wish me luck.Also, I had the most amazing 3d shots of the baby's face! He/she already has a head of hair and looks just like his damn daddy lol & he's 2lb 4oz doing well.\u00a0\u00a027wks today! ! !",
