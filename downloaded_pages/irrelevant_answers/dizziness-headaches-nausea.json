            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If your daughter is getting recurrent ear infections then she could be suffering from otitis media and you should consult a good ENT specialist for this. Taking care of her ear problems will control dizziness to a great extent. Apart from this, check for acidity, anemia, diabetes, hypoglycemia and cervical spondylosis. Postural hypotension too should be ruled out. Please consult your PCP for primary examination and investigation for all causes of dizziness followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
