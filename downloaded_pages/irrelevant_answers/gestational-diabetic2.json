            "answer": "I was diagnosed at 28 weeks and really did not want yo inject insulin. I spoke to my doc about it and he said if I can control it with diet I wouldn't have to. Also, if I ran the risk of causing any damage to my baby from it going untreated I told him I would 100% take it. Happy to say I'm 32 weeks on sat and have been at a healthy sugar level (below 7) since Dec 23rd.I cut out almost all sugar ( coffee, cereal, chocolate, ect) and almost all carbs ( they turn into sugars that just sit) I feel great, test my levels about 3 times a day and have actually lost 2 lbs because of the cutting out. You can do it, but even my doc said - don't deny your cravings just be moderate and drink lots of water.Good Luck !!",

            "answer": "This is my second pregnancy with gd. you can control it with diet and exercise. with my son my levels were so under control they wondered if I really was diabetic. I fail the curves very well. they should get you hooked up with a monitor to test your self at home. each Dr is different. I was told to test my fasting over night bg, before meals and two hours post meal. so its kind of like running a mini curve every day for me. this being the second time around with gd my levels are harder to control which can be normal. I've already landed in the we for hypoglycemia although from what I ate I should have been fine. you'll do great just remember to read labels and stuck strictly to the carb servings you get for a meal or snack. it helps to eat more protein to prevent spikes.",
