    "question": "Recently, I have started having the following symptoms:\u00a0\u00a0Faint heartbeat, low blood pressure, constant headcaches, occasional dizziness, and a odd tingle in my hands, feet , and head.\u00a0\u00a0The weird tingle isn't constant, it just comes in waves.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed that when they happen, (this is kind of hard to describe, but I will do my best) in a low light situation, I will notice that everything kind of lights up a bit.\u00a0\u00a0I assume it's because not enough blood was getting around, so my eyes were simply reacting to that.\u00a0\u00a0Any fast movements, or added stress on my heart, can trigger this, but the faint heartbeat and low blood pressure are constant.",
