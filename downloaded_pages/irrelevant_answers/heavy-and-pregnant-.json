            "answer": "Tell them not to bring it up again. Not like your not aware already and it's just rude to be reminded every time. If you're trying to manage what you eat and eat healthy but just continue to gain then it's not worth talking about unless you have gestational diabetes.",

            "answer": "With my first pregnancy my doctor seemed obsessed with my weight gain! I gained less than 30 pounds so I don't consider it to be a whole lot considering, and I was at what I still think is a healthyish weight at the end (180) but she wouldn't let up! It definitely made me feel embarassed and guilty because she didn't talk about much else. This second pregnancy I have a new doctor and he hasn't once mentioned my weight, even though I started out already obese. It feels amazing to not be spoken to like that this time. Maybe try asking your doctor to stop bringing it up so much or ask to see a different doctor and lost that as something you'd rather not discuss unless it is a direct problem in your pregnancy.",

        {
            "answer": "Its important to know that the reason they worry about weight gain and bring it up all the time is because they are very aware about the problems that come with gaining too much weight. They know there is a risk for the mothers health and a high risk for the baby, not only at birth but a high risk of child obesity later in life, of type 1 diabetes and many more illnesses. So i understand it can be annoying to be told every time you go to your doc appointement that you are gaining too much weight, but it is ONLY because they care about you and your baby. Its shows they take their job seriously.",

            "answer": "This happened to me and I always felt really embarrassed because my fianc\u00e9 would be in the room with me at every appointment. She made me feel HUGE. She was a tiny Asian woman. I never really showed throughout my whole pregnancy, I started at 109 and gained about 50lbs but was all tummy and looked 6 mo pregnant when I was in labor - anyway!!!I switched doctors after I got home from my 20 week appointment because I was so upset. My new doc was an experienced male and encouraged me as I progressed with my pregnancy, he would say things like \"you look great, the weight you're putting on is perfectly normal, etc\"I was so much happier afterwards:)",
