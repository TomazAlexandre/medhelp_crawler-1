            "answer": "Hi there,Your question has landed in the MS community, what you describe doesn't sounds like an abnormal physical response or suggestive of something being abnormal with your nerves. Any contact to the body can cause a few minutes of pain, if there is no bruising, continual pain with movement, extreme heat or burning etc the impact wasn't hard enough to have cause injury but the pain receptor in your brain, has done what it's suppose to and is letting you know of the impact.How much pain you feel has a lot to do with your individual pain tolerance, if your pain tolerance is low or hypersensitive, you could be misinterpret the amount of pain you feel as being more painful than the situation warrants. Your weight actually could be a factor, because there is a connection with being over weight and having lower pain tolerance, there are other things that can affect pain tolerance but it is something for you to consider....Hope that helps.......JJ",

            "answer": "Low pain tolerance isn't my problem. Mine is high. But whenever someone rubs my back, the pain is so intense, it's hard to breath. Like a gentle massage shouldn't hurt that bad. Thanks for the help though!",

            "answer": "Google the term allodynia. This refers to severe pain caused by what is basically a normal touch. It is not uncommon in MS, but usually it is felt as burning skin pain.If you don't have other MS symptoms and have been well-tested, then MS is not likely to be what's wrong. Yet maybe something else can cause the same issue.ess",
