            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum! I am sorry to hear about this.What I can suggest is a swab culture of the wound area to look for the organism causing the infection. Also a sensitivity test to be done to check which antibiotic is effective against the organism.Also if have diabetes then maybe the sugar is not under control. In case you do not have diabetes, then also it will be worthwhile to check your sugar levels in the blood. Poor blood supply to the area due to surgery could be another cause.Unless the cause is indentified your ordeal could be really prolonged.I think you should discuss this with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "In August I had MOHS procedure to remove basal cell carcinoma on the side of my scalp. I had an infection after the stitches were removed and they had to reopen the wound. Since then I have had to leave it open and put Bacitracin on it daily. I have also had two courses of antibiotics due to the infection came back again. Here I am almost 4 months later with an open wound on my head that won't heal. My glands on that side are swollen and tender constantly. I am worried that I will never be the same and am starting to have fatigue as I am struggling sleeping at night. How long could this draw out?",
