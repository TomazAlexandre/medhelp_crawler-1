            "answer": "Many of us feel like we are dying...it is a symptom of anxiety to have irrational fears and to obsess over \"anything\".\u00a0\u00a0Our anxiety grabs hold of a simple thought and turns it into terror....I feel you many need a visit to a therapist to help you talk out your irrational fears and then see what your plan of action should be...best to you!",

            "answer": "Like both of them said..don't worry about it!Trust me..I've had the same feelings! First I thought a tyhroid problem then I thought cancer then diabetes..then that something was wrong with my brain. It's VERY normal for people with anxiety to think that way. The thing is we don't have any of that and we are all perfectly healthy. Our fears get the best of us and are mind makes us think that way. You just have to be in control of your mind, that's the first step. Just be positive! It seems you've been given a clean bill of health so be thankful for that and just stop worrying over things. Also, if you are the type like I was to look for symptoms online..stop doing that because it only makes things much worse. Just ease your mind,\u00a0\u00a0and relax.About constantly feeling sick and stuff..that's all the mind. I was the exact same way. I'd keep sleeping and never want to do anything. I also became pale. I went to the doctors tons of time and they said I was fine. I then started eating right, and started walking/running and that has made a huge difference! Do that if possible. Go out for some fresh air..walk, run..etc. it helps stress big time.Hope that helps.Don't worry. :)",
