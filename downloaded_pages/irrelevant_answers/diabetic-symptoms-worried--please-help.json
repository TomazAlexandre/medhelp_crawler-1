            "answer": "Sorry to be prescriptive, but you really ought to eat more often, and get more exercise - from my own experience, I've found myself doing much better when I do follow my own advice (which isn't all the time). Over a short period of time, you'll find the tingling sensation much less when you do exercise.",

    "question": "I didn't know which forum to post this topic in.Oh well. I'm 18 years old, and I frequently worry that I have diabetes. I seem to see a lot of the symptoms in myself, but most just call me a hypochondriac. Let's hope they're right.I tend to exibit Lethargy, whether or not it's just because i'm a teenager or not is unknown,I don't usually have to urinate much, but i do crave drinks often.I don't over-eat, if anything, I under-eat. That's one to two meals a day.I think I get enough exercise, but I could be wrong. However, I didn't get much exercise as an adolescent.Someone says that dry, rough, discoloured patches on the skin are a sign, if so, I have one just above my elbow.It doesn't itch or hurt, though. Also, I have dry, flakey skin on my eyelids.About touch sensitivity, I can feel all of my body that i'm normally supposed to.But, my appendages seem to fall asleep fast when sittng indian-style or have my arms raised over my head when I sleep. Also, when I wake up, my feet and hands seem to be swollen just a tiny bit, but that goes away very quickly after waking up.And then, sometimes in the morning, my right index finger gets tingley, but i can still feel with it.Please say I'm just a hypochondriac.",
