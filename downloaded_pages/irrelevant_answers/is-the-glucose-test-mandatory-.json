I have a bad gag reflex and almost vomitted several times while doing them, but it was worth it I found out a few weeks ago I had gd :/ now all precautions are being taken for my lil one. If onlydecide to do it take a straw and go for the orange one in my opinion after trying all 3 I think it was the easiest. The strsw helps you go faster and swallow quicker in my opinion without tasting it as much",

            "answer": "It's not like the most fun to do. I know if I tried to opt out my doc would say I would have to find another doctor because ultimately they have to be the ones to treat and handle your pregnancy and if they don't have all the info they would be risking complications that they weren't prepared for. I have issues when I fast I feel faint and nauseous then when I drink the drink it is kind of gross cuz it's a lot of sugar but out of all of pregnancy it isn't the hardest thing you'll\u00a0\u00a0ever have to do. And gestational diabetes is hard to predict who will get it. It's not always from being overweight or an unhealthy eater. My best friend is a marathon runner and an annoyingly\u00a0\u00a0perfect eat everything healthy freak lol. She has gestational diabetes this time around.",

Gestational diabetes is a serious condition and if you should happen to have it and not know, it could cause major issues for both of you. I'm totally not trying to be rude, it's just such a simple thing to manage when you know you have it.",
