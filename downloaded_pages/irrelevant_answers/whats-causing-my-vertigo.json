            "answer": "Well, it's possible you have low blood pressure, but the doc should have checked that right off the bat, with the cuff they put on your arm.\u00a0\u00a0Next time you're in a pharmacy, see if they've got one of those machines where you sit down and take your own pressure.\u00a0\u00a0It's supposed to be about 120/80, so if it's say 100/60, well, I'd sure bring that up to the doc next time you see them.\u00a0\u00a0Also, could be you're not getting enough protein, which the bloodwork should show that when it comes back, and you yourself ought to know that, you know, eating eggs and hamburgers, stuff like that.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if you're a boy or girl, but female problems can cause that dizzy feeling, too, because of a deficiency in iron.\u00a0\u00a0By the way, a CT scan is no big deal at all, very commonly used, but you can ask them how come they're doing that, to put your mind at ease.",

    "question": "Here is whats been going on. Usually when i stand up at random times i will get extremely dizzy or everything will go black. Well one day this past week it happened all day. it got to the point where my mother had to come get me from school. i went to the doctor. they are checking for sinuses, they took bloodwork, and said that if it isn't in my blood work i have to get a ct.Everytime i go to somewhere. i cannot stand for very long or i feel tired, nd dizzy, and worn down. I do have diabetes but everytime i've checked my sugar at those times it was fine. and like during sports feeling like that i was still fine. as far as diabetes goes. but i get sick often.i guess what i am asking is, what could all of this be. especially if they end up **** a brain scan.",
