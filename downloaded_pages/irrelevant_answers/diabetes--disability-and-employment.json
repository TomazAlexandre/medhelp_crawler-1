            "answer": "Have you considered investing in one of those continous glucose monitors from minimed? They are only available in select cities right now so it may be a little difficult to get but may very well be worth it if\u00a0\u00a0it means that you can continue doing something that you like doing..working as a nurse.\u00a0\u00a0From what I have heard so far it is pretty effective in alarming you if youre going low ..high and is a great tool in allowing you to get an idea of where your blood sugars are going so that you can adjust accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0I cant wait to get one myself!",

            "answer": "Low glucose monitors sound good to me, too.\u00a0\u00a0However, I work under intense pressure sometimes when, like a nurse, I have to run fast and devote all time/energy/attention to the client's needs, not mine.\u00a0\u00a0I would often not notice that I was getting low just before a mad dash to the copier or courthouse.\u00a0\u00a0I kept a little bowl of Good&Plenty - which are very tiny in size so that you can regulate very well how many to take so that you do not overreact and go too high.\u00a0\u00a0When I have to miss lunch time (back when I was on NPH), I would take maybe four tiny pieces around the usual eating time to keep me up until I could get some lunch an hour and one-half later.\u00a0\u00a0When too low, your motor coordination can suffer as well as your ability to think well.\u00a0\u00a0I told co-workers to tell me if I reacted verbally with a non-sequitur.\u00a0\u00a0So far so good.\u00a0\u00a0I really am enjoying Lantus which is on an even keel so that all I have to concentrate on is Humalog.\u00a0\u00a0If you are careful and really count your proportions and carbs, it will really work for you.\u00a0\u00a0Grab some candy before dashing off down the hall or, when you can foresee a possible emergency in the next hour before the end of the prior dose of Humalog, grab a latte and drink part of it (if you cannot get to the bathroom to cover it with new dose of Humalog).\u00a0\u00a0I actually lost weight while working like this - but I had to exercise after work alot.\u00a0\u00a0Learn to foresee a problem and have the little bits right there so that all you have to do is reach over as soon as you hear the overhead alarm or a doctor runs up demanding your total attention.\u00a0\u00a0Sound do-able?",

            "answer": "Sweetheart, I understand how you feel.\u00a0\u00a0I was a labor and delivery nurse when I was in the military, and I found out that I was diabetic in 98 after passing out in the Operating room during a C-section (not a good thing). I was working 12's (7pm-7am) and my doctor had me to come off of that schedule at that time.\u00a0\u00a0 At that Time I Knew nothing of the pump, but at the time even THAt would've been overwhelming for me. I ended up being transferred to the OB/GYN clinic which worked better for me healthwise. The key thing for you is to focus on Tight control in order to help you become effective at ANY job.\u00a0\u00a0The military medically discharged me, and sent me to school for a \"less stressful\" position, and I am now a Speech therapist.\u00a0\u00a0I work in the school system and I have all of my holidays and breaks and summers off. I love it because as a therapist, I schedule my groups around my snack times and lunch times.\u00a0\u00a0I would suggest that you find something that you will be able to maintain a consistent schedule on such as clinic work. If you try Ward work right now, I don't think that would be a good thing, because you are consistently on the move and that makes it kinda difficult to snack and check your BS frequently. I wish you the best!!",

    "question": "I am a newly graduated nurse.\u00a0\u00a0I believed I could do the job when I was in nursing school, but have discovered I cannot do the job adequately, and even dangerously, when my sugars drop.I am facing either termination or I will have to quit so I do not harm any of my patients if this happens again.My sugar drops without warning, for I have been diabetic for 3 years and do not always feel the warning signs.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a disability?\u00a0\u00a0Are there actually places a 45 year old diabetic nurse can work without being at risk of really hurting someone?\u00a0\u00a0I am willing to be a diabetic educator, but those jobs are in high demand by the nursing community.....I don't know where to turn for advice on this.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.Thank you!smartblnde",
