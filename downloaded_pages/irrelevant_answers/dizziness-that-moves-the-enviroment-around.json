            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels), ear disorder or nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may be worsen by any clots in blood vessels, diabetes or any other underlying disorder. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",
