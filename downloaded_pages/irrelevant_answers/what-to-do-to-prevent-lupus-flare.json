            "answer": "Some things I have been told is Def stay away from sulfa medications. I was also given an herbal supplement called Max GLX (The glutathione accelerator) by a woman I know who also has lupus and swears by it. In the beginning I was skeptical, but after using this product, I too swear by it. I recently started taking this but I can definitely see a huge difference! Let me know if it works for you as well! Hope these helped! Iv just recently come close to a lupus dx so I too would love to hear other things that seem to help!",

You don't have to start out with a Select Comfort (although they are great!) - you can just pick up a cheap camping air mattress for $20 at WalMart.\u00a0\u00a0When on longer trips, I have sometimes had to resort to buying a cheap air mattress to put on top of my hotel mattress to relieve the pain and be able to sleep!!\u00a0\u00a0That is how I cope with my pain without drugs.To avoid flares, avoid sunlight or UV rays in a tanning bed!!\u00a0\u00a0I am trying for a diagnosis, so I have been stepping up my tanning bed exposure and last night I felt the weakest ever and dizzy while sleeping and woke up with a 20-beat tachycardia!!\u00a0\u00a0Scary!Good luck to you!WAF",
