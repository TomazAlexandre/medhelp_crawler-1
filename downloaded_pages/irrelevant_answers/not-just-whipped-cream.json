    "question": "Other than whipped cream there are other foods that can cause great harm. One man lived on Mc Donald's hamburgers for a month as a test. At the end of the month he was almost a basket case and eventuslly died from the continuing effects of the hamburgers. A woman who loved chocolates would eat three boxes of cherry filledchocolates every day. Eventually she had what was described as ,\"Brain freeze.\"\u00a0\u00a0Her symptons resembled that of the brai freeze that you get fron slurpee that you drink too fast. Speaking of slurpees. too many can cause a deterioration of the esophagus (hope it's spelled right).However, the slurpee one is open for debate. Some scientists have declared that, that is so much bull. We all know about cigarrettes and drugs but there are many ordinary foods that we eat every day and really never think about that are just as dangerous over time. Packaging of cereals contain dangerous chemicals even though we are brain washed into thinking that this and many others of this type are hardly worth worrying about. The sugar that almost every food product is laced with can lead to diabetes and other health matters. The chemicals used to preserve varioos foods, the injection of chemical waste into the waters and the air, the perfumes that can initiate asthmatic or allergic reactions and on and on and on. This is a society that is slowly poisoning us in the hunt for power and wealth. Nations have finally realized that global arming is not a myth but a reality. Drugs tthat are produced with a myriad of side effects which warrants more drugs to combat the side effects and then even more to combat the drugs that combat side effects etc. etc. etc. So it comes down to what? It comes down to the fact that we are bombarded with ads that downplay the true dangers of this that or the other. MONEY is more important than the health and well being of people. Billions ,of dollars are made on the backs of the sick and the poor, so why change it .",
