            "answer": "What you are describing may be spasms in his legs, and signs of a problem either in his thoracic or cervical spine, or possible his brain. I would agree with the other doctor that your father needs to see a neurologist. Based on the doctors examination\u00a0\u00a0and history it may be possible to determine if this is a spine or brain problem. A MRI of the brain cervical and thoracic spine may need to be performed/reviewed. Besides a structural lesion which would be seen on a MRI, other things which could be considered include B12 deficiency, inflammatory disorders, or vascular abnormalities either within the spine or brain. Without more information, I can not be more specific. Good luck.",
