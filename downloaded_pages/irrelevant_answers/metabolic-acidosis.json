            "answer": "I am sorry for your loss.I checked a medical encyclopedia, and apparently the question of whether another child of the same parents will be at risk depends on what caused the metabolic acidosis in the first place.\u00a0\u00a0Here is some of what it says:_____________________Metabolic acidosis occurs when the body produces too much acid, or when the kidneys are not removing enough acid from the body.\u00a0\u00a0There are several types of metabolic acidosis:Diabetic acidosis (also called diabetic ketoacidosis and DKA) develops when substances known as ketone bodies, which are acidic, build up during uncontrolled type 1 diabetesHyperchloremic acidosis results from excessive loss of sodium bicarbonate from the body, as can happen with severe diarrheaLactic acidosis is a buildup of lactic acid. It can be caused by:AlcoholCancerExercising for a very long timeLiver failureLow blood sugar (hypoglycemia)Medications such as salicylatesProlonged lack of oxygen from shock, heart failure, or severe anemiaSeizuresOther causes of metabolic acidosis include:Kidney disease (distal tubular acidosis and proximal renal tubular acidosis)Poisoning by aspirin, ethylene glycol (found in antifreeze), or methanolSevere dehydration_______________As you can see, some of the causes are avoidable, and some are inherent but manageable (like diabetes) and some are probably not treatable.\u00a0\u00a0The parents should talk to the doctor to find out more about what the cause was, so they can know the possibilities for another child.",
