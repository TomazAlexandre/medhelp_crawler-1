Later that night after he was sleeping for about 1 to 2 hours I had to wake him to ask him why there was sugar all over my kitchen. When I woke him he was sweating, his eyes were red and swollen, his face looked fuffy, and he was soooo out of it. There has got to be something about eating or having sugar while on Seriqul.",

            "answer": "All atypical antipsychotics can cause diabetes. It is a common long term effect that has to be monitored for as well as tardive dyskinesia. Ability is the least likely to cause it but it is still possible. A newer generation of anti-psychotics, the glutamate antagonists in development will not cause diabetes or tardive dyskinesia and promotes a full recovery. I am on glycine a Phase II antipsychotic in FDA study that is a glutamate antagonist that has promoted a recovery that is according to my psychopharmocologist \"as good as any FDA approved anti-psychotics or better\". My study will be published soon in a psychiatric journal. These will be the future generation of anti-psychotics, among other classes in study. In meantime, people should get yearly bloodtests, a good idea in general but especially for sugar level. This can monitor to prevent diabetes from occuring. And a sensible diet should be maintained knowing that all current anti-psychotics can cause weight gain that can if not followed with potentially lead to diabetes. This can be kept in check and in the future when new anti-psychotics come out will then no longer be an issue.",
