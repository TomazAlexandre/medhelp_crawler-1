    "question": "Hello my name is Babbal I am new to the forum. Ok so here is my issue I weigh 230 lbs absolutley unintentional I cannot lose weight no matter what I consume only about a thousand calories a day not because i starve myself because frankly that is my capacity when a growing male my age needs about 2500. Next I have a very very slow digestive system I have GERD take prevacid 30mg twice a day.. After i eat i don't stuff myself I have heaviness and bloating and no amount of exercise can reduce even a pound combined with diet. My thyroid tests diabetes all that were all normal. I am losing my mind I have lack of concentration, fatigue, acanthosis nigricans in all the folds on my body so i have to aplply lotions there several times a day bacause they get dry, have had hemmorhoids for the past three years. Please Please suggest me a suggestion I have had an endoscopy normal results. Please tell me what is wrong with me! Thank You very much!",
