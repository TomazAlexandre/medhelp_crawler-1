            "answer": "Unfortunately, I did not bring my ranges/levels home (too excited that my last 2 visits -incidentally with 2 different doctors, a GP and an Endocrinologist) confirmed all results normal. I will get a hold of those numbers on my next visit in 3 weeks.What \"hashisgirl\" said sort of confirms what the GP told me, i,e, that it may take a while for everything to get back to normal. My concern is that at times (but not always), the shaking in my body feels like it is intensifying instead of going away.I thought about resuming working out with weights as a way to rehabilitate my muscles, but the more pronounced shaking during and after exercising discouraged me from doing it seriously. Should I just work through it? My first Endo had told me I can do anything I've always done if I want to. Has anyone gone through this? Is exercising through the shaking likely to get improvements?",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with mild hyperthyroidism about 6 months ago and started taking PTU. My last test results as of a couple of weeks ago show no signs of hyperthyroidism left, but I continue to have muscle shaking (anytime I apply tension to any muscle group of my body). I have been seen by 6 different doctors including 2 endocrinologists. They've all pointed to hyperthyroidism (through blood tests, no swelling of my thyroid gland; They say nothing neurological such as Parkinson's. What is this shaking, like a low electrical current running through my muscles? It gets worse if I try to lift weights, exercise or carry something heavy. I also feel weaker and can't easily lift things I used to.Heart racing is under control but palpitations still happen every so often.I was just prescribed a low dose of Atenolol which is supposed to slow down the cardio-vascular system a bit, and a low dose of Tapazole to see what happens on little amounts of medication in the next few months.Does anyone know about these symptoms and whether they're supposed to go away now that the tests have shown improvement?",
