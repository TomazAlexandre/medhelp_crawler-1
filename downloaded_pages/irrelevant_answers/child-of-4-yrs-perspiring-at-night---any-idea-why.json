            "answer": "Cold sweating can have many etiologies, however cardiogenic ischemia is one of them. That means, in simple terms, the heart may not be getting enough oxygen. The fact the child is anemic is a yellow flag for this condition. This does NOT mean that your child has any lasting damage. And it may not be the cause. If you can obtain an inexpensive pulse oximeter (clips to the fingernail) you might want to know the percentage of ocygen in the blood. An arterial blood gas is the only btrue measure, however. Consult a cardiologist and ask for his opinion.",

    "question": "Hi there. My child sweats quite a bit in the first hour of sleep and we frequently have to change his clothing. He is fine then for the remainder of the night. He had this in early childhood and it has reappeared now in the last month or so. He has a history of anemia at 18 months - cause unknown and thought to be historical although his red cell count is 11.3 now as it was when 6 m onths afer being treated for anemia - it had been at a low of 7.9 - if anyone has any similar experiences I would appreciate if they could share them or indeed if anyone has an idea of what might be causing this comments would be welcome also. I'm pretty sure he is not overdressed and the room temp is usually a cool 17 degrees celsius/63 F",
