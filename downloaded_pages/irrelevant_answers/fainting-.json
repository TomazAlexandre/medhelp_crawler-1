            "answer": "Your post is puzzling when you say \"Medics came glucose 260, BP normal, at ER all tests scans good.\" Did they test his glucose again while in ER? What scans were performed? Are you in area where there is high heat? If yes, was he well hydrated prior to going outside? I would schedule a visit with a doctor for a full health examination which should include stress testing [heart], and an A1c test to see how well he is controlling his glucose levels. Good luck",

            "answer": "Loss of conscious in any emergency room I have every worked in mandates an overnight stay for observation. This is not the case in certain emergency rooms in Somalia and Afghanistan, and a little Island off the coast of Iceland notorious for practicing polygamy, but everywhere else, that is the drill.Clearly a neurological event took place, which seems to have been consistent with a petit mal seizure, etiology unknown. Because he is a diabetic one must not assume that the loss of consciousness is due to his diabetes.Normally anti-seizure medications are not prescribed until the third episode, so at this point you need to have a period of \"watchful waiting\", and schedule him for a neurological work-up to include an EEG.",
