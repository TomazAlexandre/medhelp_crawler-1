            "answer": "i dunno. i have the inherited tremors which i suppose are essential tremors, but the difference is, when i concentrate on doing something\u00a0\u00a0like drawing, it stops. my grandfather made so much noise when he read the newspaper that we couldn't hear the radio. but he could make these tiny fishing flies.were it me, i would insist that this be worked up. if he had a dangerous accident, then that is reason enough right there.i take propranolol for mine and it helps a great deal.good luck,wannadance",

            "answer": "Hi,I would suggest you to get his blood sugar levels tested to rule out diabetes since he has the symptom of non stop eating.There can be many causes of tremors and some tremors are known to run in families. Since most of the causes have been ruled out, other causes like magnesium deficiency need to be considered. Magnesium deficiency is also known to cause tremors. Please discuss this possibility with his doctor before you get a neurological work up done.Take care!",

    "question": "My husband is 33 and last week developed a serve hand tremor on his left side and just a little on his right (the right side hardly ever tremors).\u00a0\u00a0He went to the doctors and they said to come back in 10 days if it had not got any better.\u00a0\u00a0They said it might be something he just has to live with.\u00a0\u00a0They also gave him a beta blocker and said it should help.\u00a0\u00a0After seven days the tremor is no better and on his way home from the doctors the tremor got really bad in both hands and he rolled the car.\u00a0\u00a0Thank goodness he was fine.The tremor is mostly a resting one and also against gravity.\u00a0\u00a0 Things that we have noticed, that might not or could be related are, that he has bruising easily (especially under the upper arms) and we found a nickel size lump on his upper left arm (we don't know if it is from the none stop tremors).\u00a0\u00a0His thyroid was tested 4 weeks ago and it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0He has been having difficulty with concentration and he has been eating none stop. He is a very healthy weight and has good blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0When he draws things like spirals they have little notches very close together.\u00a0\u00a0He does not having any problem moving anywhere else in his body.The doctors we have seen don't seem very concerned but do you think I should push them to recommend him to a neurologist. Could it be just essential tremors?\u00a0\u00a0Or is it more serious?\u00a0\u00a0Any info would be great.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your time in reading this.",
