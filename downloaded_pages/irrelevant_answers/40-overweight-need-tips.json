            "answer": "I'm also overweight and have been told for years that I'd probably have trouble getting pregnant. I had never tried until i met my bf and I got pregnant in less then a year(I know\u00a0\u00a0its a little fast). Anyway, I'm 39 weeks today and have a fairly good pregnancy. I was diagnosed with high blood pressure but with the medicine is under control. I was nervous about being overweight and pregnant mostly about gaining more weight but I haven't gained too much I'm healthy and the babies healthy. I do have a few concerns about labor and delivery but I guess I'll cross that bridge when I get there. Hope all goes well with you.",

            "answer": "One thing I wish I would have known before having my first child (as an overweight woman) is to avoid csection. The more belly fat we have the higher the risk for infection. My dr knew as soon as she saw me that a csection was going to be a problem for me. Unfortunately I had an emergency one and sure enough a week after being discharged I was back in the hospital with an infection.Try your best to control your salt and sugar intake so that you don't have higher risk of hypertension and diabetes.I notice there isn't a lot of conversation on here about how pregnancy is different for the plus sized ladies but it is.I wish you the best in health and pregnancy.",
