            "answer": "I am sorry that this has happened to you. We have several members that have experienced an inaccurate drug screen also. Your physician will not offer solutions. I beleive that they don't know the cause themselves.The reasons are not clear but it is not an uncommon occurrence. Lasix (furosemide), Hypertensive agents or other medications that do not contain a narcotic cannot produce a false positive or negative drug test. Diabetes will not interfere with the test either.There are statistics that claim urine drug screens are as high as 60-70% inaccurate. These tests are not fail proof though the company/facility conducting them rely on them to be 100% accurate.If you find the answer you will be wealthy. It can just be the results of human error as Dalek4 indicated above. There are some articles on the subject. I may have one that I can PM you if you are interested in reading it.Again I am sorry that this has happened to you. I hope you will not suffer huge ramifications. Please keep in touch.Peace,Tuck",

    "question": "I am trying to do some research into how you can have a false negative drug test for Hydrocodone.\u00a0\u00a0Can other meds interfere with this urine test?\u00a0\u00a0Other medical problems?\u00a0\u00a0Can taking Lasix, being diabetic, or blood pressure meds cause this?\u00a0\u00a0I just know that the meds are being taken and the urine test came back negative and the Dr was rude and will not give me any answers to why.\u00a0\u00a0So if anyone knows how or where I can look into this I would be in your debt.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",
