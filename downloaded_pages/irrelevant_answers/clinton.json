            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems.\u00a0\u00a0The numbness could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar or median nerve at the elbow level or even at the wrist. Once a nerve is compressed, it can cause pain or numbness anywhere along its path.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar, median and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness of arms and fingers. Please consult a neurologist. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
