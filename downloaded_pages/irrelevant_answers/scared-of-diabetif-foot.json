            "answer": "I'm sorry you are having such a hard time. Not feeling like you can leave the house, unfortunately, makes it harder as you really should get checked out medically. If you do that you will either be reassured that you are alright or if you are pre-diabetic or diabetic you can begin to manage that condition. January 2009 is quite awhile ago if you are, in fact, developing diabetes. I don't know if your symptoms are diabetic neuropathy or not, nobody can diagnose you online, but it is not too likely as it takes a long time of high blood sugars to develop diabetic complications and if you are, in fact diabetic, it hasn't been that long. Until you feel able to get to the doctor, one thing you can do is have somebody get you a glucose meter and test your blood sugar. Normal people have under 100 fasting (100-125 is considered pre-diabetes and 126 and over is considered diabetic). You could even get a home testing kit at the pharmacy and test your A1C which is now the standard for diagnosis. 5.7 to 6.4 is pre-diabetic and 6.5 and over is diabetic. If you are diabetic you can begin to make changes by losing weight and reducing carb intake. Those things are postive changes you can make for your health and will increase your well-being.",
