            "answer": "There's a great book I picked up on multiples (I'm not having twins but I love learning about birth). It's called \"The Everything Twins, Triplets, and More Book\", by Pamela Fierro. It has a ton of information on how multiple pregnancies differ from singletons (like getting tested for gestational diabetes earlier) and even how to deal with having two babies at once (from nursing to sleeping and more). I bet you could find it on Amazon.",
