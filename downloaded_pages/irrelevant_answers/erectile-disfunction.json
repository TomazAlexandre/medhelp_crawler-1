            "answer": "1.\u00a0\u00a0Whether or not your doctor is male or female, lesbian, gay or straight, he or she has heard a patient tell of erectile dysfunction every week of practice, probably.\u00a0\u00a0You will not overwhelm your doctor with the appalling embarrassment of your question.\u00a0\u00a0This is so normal as to be unexceptional.2.\u00a0\u00a0If you cannot bring yourself to talk about it, ask for a referral to a urologist or a male doctor.3.\u00a0\u00a0By all means talk to your heart doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He or she will have gotten this question all the time since Viagra is part of the discussion.4.\u00a0\u00a0You will not die alone if you do not want to.\u00a0\u00a0Many lady friends past age 50 have boyfriends who are not John Holmes, and they don't mind.\u00a0\u00a0There is always hands, \"toys,\" and mouths even if you never take Viagra and never get an erection.\u00a0\u00a0A woman who is unwilling to have a relationship because the sex needs to be a little more creative is no woman to have as a lady friend, even if you did not have erectile dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0Please don't sell yourself short.\u00a0\u00a0The same way a woman is more than a vagina, a man is much, much more than a penis.I saw a picture on the Internet of a tough-looking head-shaved, bearded guy painting his little daughter's fingernails with fingernail paint.\u00a0\u00a0his wife had captioned the picture, \"One of the many, many reason why I love him.\"\u00a0\u00a0That was just so dead right.\u00a0\u00a0We don't love a man for whether he has a big boner in the sack.\u00a0\u00a0We love him for his certainty that he is a good man that overflows into his generous and strong actions.",
