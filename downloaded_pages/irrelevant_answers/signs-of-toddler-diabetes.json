            "answer": "Back to your question about foods until he is properly tested and diagnosed. While waiting to see the endo, do talk to his doctor about whether insulin is necessary (his fasting sugar is higher than normal, but not dangerously so). I would think that the most important thing for now would be to get a glucometer and start testing his glucose levels to see how they are ranging. What is his usual fasting sugar? How high or low is he before meals and maybe about 2 hours after meals? Answers to those questions may help the endo settle on the right treatment for him.Anyway, if I were you, I would avoid giving him sugar-sweetened drinks for now. And avoid high-carb meals and high-sugar foods for now until he is under an endo's care. Whole grains are good, and proteins like cheese are good if he is OK with dairy products.",

            "answer": "I have been monitoring my son's food and taking him blood sugar regularly. His sugar is anywhere from 58-84 in the morning before breakfast and then at night two hours after supper usually around 125 if he plays hard after eating. But during the day they go from 76 and then two hours later it was 143... is it normal for it to vary that much?",

    "question": "I have adopted a two year old son. He is a little short for his age but he is stalky. When we first got him about 6 months ago he would eat anything and everything you put in front of him. Now he has gotten to where he will hardly eat anything but he drinks constantly. It doesn't matter what you give him to drink he will drink all of it and instantly want more. When he is drinking he drink he doesn't just drink it he downs almost the entire drink before sitting it down. When he finally does put it down it is only because he is out of breath. His diapers are soaked and always smell bad. His poopy diapers are also very fowl. He has not gained any weight since he have had him despite the first five and a half months were he would eat everything he saw. He also will drink anything he can including his bath water. If you tell him to wait on a drink because you are busy at the moment he starts crying uncontrollably. We have been told by friends to have him tested for diabetes but I'm not sure what the signs of diabetes are. If you could help me I would really appreciate it.",
