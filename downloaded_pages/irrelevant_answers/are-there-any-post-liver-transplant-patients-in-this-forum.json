            "answer": "Thanks for the feedback. My wife is also 46 years old. 3-years post ALDLT on Jan. 30th. And although they say she will loose the graft due to extremely agressive virus she looks better than past 6-7 years. They say that if Tx. was started immediately post-op, as never cleared below 20,000 she may have faired better. Now she has been between 7.5 and 8 million for some time. She was to start back this week after 2.5 years of PEG./RIB. with only recent 2 month break, but she is not stable. Too much inflam., onset diabetes 2 and on and on. Regardless she's comin home for a while, maybe a month. I'm very excited and if my broke down body could jump for joy I would. I want you all to know don't stop fighting this nasty thing. As my wife has clearly proved to us, you can endure much more than you know. And myself having spent over 2 decades in chronic pain, spinal disease and alot of whellchair time, consuming 15-20 pills a day to stand for a couple hours, I too can attest to the strenght of the human body to endure. thanks again...",
