            "answer": "I failed the one hour one with a 142, but I passed the 3 hour one. Make sure you don't drink or eat anything at least 12 hours for your appointment. It's very similar to the one hour one, they just take your blood 4 times instead of once. They do it once when you get there and then once every hour for 3 hours. Don't stress about it until you get the results from the 3 hour test :)",
