            "answer": "You have the same point of living as everyone else does my friend. We're all dying. Nothing we can do can stop that. The question is, how do you choose to live your life under the circumstances you've been dealt. I struggle too. I have autoimmune thyroid disease, chronic pain,\u00a0\u00a0a family history of hyper cholesterol, triglycerides & heart disease, I've got herpes simplex 1 (from childhood), HPV and just recently had a run in with gonorrhea. (now cured)\u00a0\u00a0Every 10 days I have to inject myself because of hormonal imbalances I have. So.. I understand what it feels like to feel sick, tired, and unwanted. I'm sure there are plenty of other people out there that have circumstances far more difficult than ours. At least ours are manageable.So what is the point of living? For me, the only thing that seems to have any real continuity in life is the relationships we establish with other people. Its very easy to get trapped focusing in on the self so much that we forget that we're a part of a much larger community. Once we start to understand our place in the world, its easier to accept life and its struggles in proper stride. Here are some things to remember:1. Life is hard.Sometimes we think the world owes us...and quite honestly...it doesn't.2. You're not that important.We like to think the world revolves around us, but again...it doesn't.3. Your life isn't about you.Its actually about our interaction with others.4. You're not in control.This is tough for our ego to accept. There's very little we can control in this life. Thinking we have control is illusionary.5. You're going to die.Many are afraid of non-existence. This is a huge spiritual question that needs to be resolved on a personal level.My suggestion would be to get involved. Become active and social. Surround yourself with friends and family. There are millions of experiences out there that can have profound impact on you and help you see that your situation in life isn't that bad. I know life can be depressing sometimes, but it can also be wonderful.If you're feeling really bad, maybe you should consider seeing a counselor to help you with your depression.",

            "answer": "Yep, we all have stuff we think no one will accept.\u00a0\u00a0I have hsv2, allergies to just about everything, I had a hysterectomy 4 years ago and can't have kids, etc etc.Remember that your partners aren't near perfect either.\u00a0\u00a0They have their own ****, and it might not be near as managable as diabetes and herpes.\u00a0\u00a0Bad credit or a criminal record will probably affect a relationship more than any medical thing, not to mention if kids or psycho exes are involved.\u00a0\u00a0;)Please consider counseling and do it soon.\u00a0\u00a0If you are even thinking of suicide, or dying, then you need help.\u00a0\u00a0Do a search for suicide hotlines, and they can refer you for help.AJ",
