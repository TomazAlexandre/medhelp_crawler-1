            "answer": "Thank you. Boy do I know about sugar imbalance. When its out awhack everything seems to get freaky. Since being sick this year, sugar level has been great, stays around 80-100. The only exception is that it has dropped a few times the last month or so. Tick or bites? I doubt it. Dont get out much and have not noticed any bites. Toxicity????Also forgot to mention, I noticed dark blotches on my lower legs, some small and some as big as coin. Very noticable. Been there since beginning of all this about 10 months ago.",

    "question": "10 months ago this all started...Woke up lips swollen and had what I thought was a stomach bug. Vomiting, diahrea, tired. Spent about 3 days in bathroom and bed. Thought it was over but it was just starting. From that day till now I have had constant nausea and vomiting. Sometimes I have a few minutes, or a day or so with no symptoms, but vary rarely. It doesnt seem to be connected to eating, food allergies, there is no rhyme or reason that I can pinpoint. I started out weighing 390 almost 400lbs and have lost about 80 lbs over the last ten months, most was lost within the first few months. Other conditions prior to this are: back pain due to digenerative disc and sciatica, obviously overweight, diabetic(take pills), hysterectomy 2004 due to pain and polycystic ovarian disorder(complete removal). Family history: breast cancer and non cancerous tumors, diabetes, non alcholic chirosis of the liver(native american).Since becoming ill with constant nausea and vomiting, I have almost stopped all meds including those for diabetes. My sugar is dropping even with not taking meds. I go many times days without eating. If I get a craving for something I try to eat it right away. I have some success keeping things down sometimes.Symptoms the past 10 months:nausea, vomiting, passing out(fainting) several times, dizzy for no reason, right hand cramps up like frozen, pain in left arm moved to neck then pain in chest(lasted several months), chest wall inflamation(unknown reason), sudden diahria(quite often), headache(dont usually have them)lately more severe, feeling weird(just not right), short term memory loss(some time cant remember current conversation), itchy parts of body, scalp itches bad(no new meds or foods).Last week notice swollen and red throat with some white spots on tonsils and also noticed golf ball sized lump in upper arm(on inside of arm but not in armpit). Blood pressure is normally really low but last month at er pressure high(figure it was the pain raising it).Test done: Was referred to gastro doc and had complete work up and testing. Endoscopy(showed inflamed stomach, gastritis). Gastric emptying, scans of gallbladder, liver(showed fatty liver, no gastroparesis, gallbladder works fine). Other than fatty liver, gastritis no other gastro problems. I took meds to coat stomach for two months. Now only take prevacid. Still no help.With current insurance the only doctors available to manage my care are two doctors at my clinic and when need to the local er. If anyone has any ideas or can relate, please share. I need to know what to ask my doc for(testing or specialist, etc). Because they are not proactive at all. Any ideas please. I know some of my symptoms are probably due to lack of nurisment from being sick or dehydrated or sugar, but not all can be.",
