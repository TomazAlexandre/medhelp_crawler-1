            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Commonest cause of chronic nausea or vomiting is acidity. Take omeprazole (empty stomach in morning) and antacid gel and see if it helps. Liver and kidney dysfunction is another cause. Hence kidney and liver function tests should be done. Other causes are diabetes and hypothyroidism. Electrolyte imbalance too can cause nausea. IBS, gluten or lactose intolerance, parasites in gut too can be the cause. A stool test should be done for worms, giardiasis etc. Also if nothing is found then food challenge test to detect food intolerance should be done. If Omeprazole and antacids do not help, go to a walk in clinic and consult a doctor there. Take care!",

    "question": "I am a healthy 24 year old female but for about 2 months now I have been vomiting what I think is bright yellow bile every couple of days and am very nauseous for most of the day. I don't have insurance so I am trying to get some answers any way that I can. I know this is a very broad symptom, but it normally happens in the mornings and evenings. I am not pregnant and have been eating healthy. Any advice??",
