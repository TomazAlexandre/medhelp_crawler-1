            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?Nerve Root Pain - nerve root pinching / irritation / compression / trapping is always associated with signs of nerve dysfunction (not working properly) such as pain, tingling, numbness, and weakness. This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.I think you need to take a review opinion. You also need to get your sugars checked to rule diabetes.A consultation with a physician will be helpful.If required you can consult a neurologist.CAT scan was done to see if any bleeding has happened to rule out any TIA's.MRI scan of cervical region will be helpful.Hope this helps.Bye.",

    "question": "First off I would like to say thank you for taking time out to answer questions. My name is Laura I am a 21 year old female. The reason I am writing is cause on December 11 2007 I began feeling numbness in my left hand and then it went into my lower lip. This was all while I was at work then about 10 min later I got a server headache. I live about a hour away from work, but the thing is as soon as I got home I didn't remember the ride. I went straight to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0While there I threw up twice. I had sensitivity to light and sound. The doctors gave me a CAT scan, and had told me they saw nothing out of the normal. It has only been two days since the incident, but I can't help and think I should go get a second option.\u00a0\u00a0I should add also that since this happened I still have a headache and I do not feel like myself. So please if you could give me some kind of guidance with what I should do I would be very thankful.",
