I was concerned about diabetes in the past, and now I am starting to worry again.\u00a0\u00a0Do these symptoms sound concerning?",

            "answer": "Definitely have it checked out. My 6-year-old was just diagnosed with diabetes Type-1. She had started wetting the bed off and on for a couple of months, she had terrible behavior, public tantrums and all. then she started eating a ton and we noticed she lost weight. Now on a 46 pound girl, losing 3 pounds means a lot. We previously blamed her red dye allergy to the behavior. Maybe it was just the sugar that accompanied the red dye. Don't hesitate to go to the pediatrician. If you mention frequent trips to the bathroom, stomach aches, and tired, your doc should automatically do a urine test.My daughter has been insulin dependent for almost 3 weeks and she is a different child. Much more pleasant to be around, she looks better, acts better and feels better. It has changed our lives for the better.",
