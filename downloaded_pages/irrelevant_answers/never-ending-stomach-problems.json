Brat diet is bananas rice applesauce and toast. That AND Only water. If she does that and it helps then maybe it was gas or something in her digestive track. She also look into getting a colonoscopy. I hope and pray she finds out what is wrong.",

            "answer": "She may have adhesions from previous surgery and/or diverticulitis. A endoscopy and/or laparoscopy may help reach a diagnosis. Or indeed, if it were me, I might opt for a laparotomy because that is the only way to deal with adhesions.",

    "question": "I'm posting this question on behalf of my mother. She is in her mid 40's and for the last few years she has experienced debilitating stomach pains. Through many doctor and ER visits, she hasn't received a treatment or diagnosis that has given her any relief. She regularly sees a gastroenterologist but that hasn't seemed to help. She's had a full hysterectomy. Her gallbladder has been removed, but she still has an appendix. Within the past year she was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, but she has been managing it well. In the past she has been diagnosed with diverticulitis, diverticulosis,gastrointestinal atony. She is on pain medicine, but it does little to help the pain. Her severe pain is causing depression. Specific foods have not been a trigger, but she is usually sick with diarrhea after she eats a meal. This mystery illness is affecting her quality of life. If you have any idea of what could be causing this or any types of specialists she could see, please help.",
