Other symptoms are frequent trips in the middle of night to the bathroom and extrem thirst in the night.Ron",

            "answer": "A glucometer is kind of an expensive investment if you're not sure you even have diabetes. You can ask your GP to check\u00a0\u00a0your fasting blood sugar. They can either do that in his office or give you a lab slip for one. I'm lucky in that I work in a skilled nursing facility, and can just ask one of the nurses to check mine. I've done that several times, because, I worry also. My BS is just fine, was a little high once when I wasn't fasting when it was taken (119)Several people here have diabetes post tx. Do you have other risk factors besides some extra weight & hep c that make you more likely to develop diabetes? Like family history, high triglycerides and high cholesterol?Here's a link to insulin resistant-pre-diabetes:http://diabetes.niddk.nih.gov/dm/pubs/insulinresistance/I tookk a continuing ed course on diabetes and learned enough to put me to sleep, as I wasn't as interested in it at the time! My grandmother was a type 2 diabetes (adult onset) but no one else in my family has developed it.Good luck,Bug",

We suggest that islet cell autoantibodies and glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies should be investigated before and during interferon treatment in order to identify subjects at high risk of developing type 1 diabetes mellitus....http://tinyurl.com/ynvtcqNot sure if any more recent studies avail on this.__ Jim",

            "answer": "I've heard that the Walmart meter is cheap and good.\u00a0\u00a0Anybody with a question about diabetes ougut to buy one, because diabetes goes undiagnosed in a similar way to hcv, and for a similar reason: medical economics.I''ve been slowly developing diabetes over the last several years, long before being diagnosed with hcv, but I suspect that the hcv aggravated it, since I'm not overweight.\u00a0\u00a0My brother and his wife are both diabetic, she since in the age of 2 (she has type 1, which is actually a different disease), and they are also extremely knowledgeable, really on the cutting edge of self-care.\u00a0\u00a0Here's what I've learned from them, and I really feel strongly about this, so please take it seriously.The American Diabetes Society's standards are based on the assumption that people won't go that extra mile, that they're not going to be as \"compliant\" to treatment as they should be.\u00a0\u00a0So the ADA has very minimal requirements.\u00a0\u00a0The American Assn. of Clinical Endocrinologists has established much higher standards, and if you don't want diabetic damage you should take a look at their web site.\u00a0\u00a0Basically, any fasting blood sugar over 100 is pre-diabetic, and you need to change your eating habits and exercise habits, and you may need medication, probably metforman (glucophage).\u00a0\u00a0If, after meals, you go over 200 (which you will test with your meter), you are fully diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0The definition of full-blown diabetes is over 126 fasting, over 200 one hour after a meal (one with lots of carbs).Here's why a fasting blood sugar test is inadequate: Some people, and I am one of them, can still pass the fasting, but a nice piece of chocolate cake will shoot their numbers way up - I can hit 250 easily.\u00a0\u00a0Test yourself several times, because the human body is weird, and this sugar elevation won't always happen.\u00a0\u00a0I think it depends on what you ate the day before and how much exercise you had.\u00a0\u00a0In any event, if you have a fasting over 100 or a post-prandial over 200, you must do something.I started with metformin when I became prediabetic, and I'm now shooting 16 units of lantus insulin every night before going to bed.\u00a0\u00a0Along with diet and exercise, this regime seems to be controlling my sugar fairly well (if I can control my sweet tooth, which is sometimes difficult).\u00a0\u00a0During tx for hcv I must confess that, other than the insulin, I totally neglected my diabetes, since all I could eat was fruit and icecream, and I couldn't move enough to get any exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Now I'm trying to get it back in control, because I don't want to be one of those diabetic amputees or anything else like that.My sister-in-law has lived with diabetes for over 50 years without any bodily damage because she follows the rules and takes good care of herself (I think great genetics may be helping too).\u00a0\u00a0Her example has kept me from being frightened and eager to take control.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know what you find out.",

    "question": "Just watched a short clip on CNN that says based on a population based study, (whatever that is) we have an significantly increased chance of developing diabetes 2.\u00a0\u00a0Not a lot of meat to the article and it wasn't even specified whether it was related to interferon use or not.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I'm wondering if some of the symptoms I've been feeling is NOT fatigue from Hep C, but diabetes 2.I know I gained too much weight back after failing treatment in 2003, but I am still pretty active and push myself a lot to do THINGS, mow the lawn, take the stairs, etc.Does anybody else wonder about diabetes 2?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, I get a kind of dizzy feeling, sort of woozy, but it passes quickly.\u00a0\u00a0I watch the sugar I eat, but still have a popsicle every day.\u00a0\u00a0I'm working on losing 30 lbs, I lost 50 lbs during tx but gained it all back over the last three years, it was quite insidious, very slowly creeping back to my bu tt and thighs.It pops into my head that I am carrying around 30 extra 1 lb. new york strip steaks and no wonder I am freakin tired.\u00a0\u00a0 I've upped my veges and fruit and have cut back seriously on portions.So I'm thinking I need a glucose meter, take the blood sugar\u00a0\u00a0now and then and see what's up.\u00a0\u00a0Every once in a while, I will read something that talks about \"insulin-resistance\" and am wondering if this is one of the gifts left to me by IFN.\u00a0\u00a0Anybody have any experience with this?Let me know, before I go see my GP, I need to know what to tell him.\u00a0\u00a0He is very scared to treat me because of his lack of knowledge about Hep C and is always grateful when I tell him what I need.\u00a0\u00a0Sad situation, but my infectious Doc is in Seattle, about 300 miles away.\u00a0\u00a0So I am on my own and I don't know about the rest of you, but since I was diagnosed with Hep C, a lot of my treatment has been in my own hands, my own research and I'm glad to do it.Willows",
