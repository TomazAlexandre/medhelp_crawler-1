    "question": "For the last year I have been suffering with extremely aching shoulders, as time has gone on I have the following symptoms:\u00a0\u00a0Dry itchy eyes, aching foot/heel, weight gain and inability to lose weight (even with excercise), dry hair, small amount of hair loss, red patches on skin after being in the sun, depression, memory loss (brain farts :P) irregular periods-3 months nothing (meridia), eye protrusion (noticed by friends and family, not me) a very tired look (dark eyes), increased acne, I usually pluck my eyebrows every 2 weeks, have not in 3 months as I have no hair growth. Did I mention TIRED!, I can sleep for 8 hours restful, get up and shower and I am ready to go to bed again for another 8 hours. Oh and the depressed feeling.....unable to shake the feeling of uneasy....I am 35 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I have no children. I am 235 pounds (heavy for me) and I smoke (20 years) but mostly I have been in perfect health, no major illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0My youngest sister has had many of the same symptoms I have and her doctor has ordered blood work for thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0My maternal grand mother has been diagnosed with hypothyroid issues and now takes medication,\u00a0\u00a0both my great grandmothers had a hypothyroid, one had thyroid removed. My grand father and great aunt have polymyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0Father died of brain tumor.I am in alot of pain with my shoulders, I use the computer for work and thought I had tendonitis or carpel tunnel syndrome.\u00a0\u00a0Pain started with Right shoulder/bicep and has now moved to the left. I do not have insurance and cannot afford to see a multitude of health care professionals.\u00a0\u00a0I am hoping I can find some answers on items to discuss at 1 visit so that I can pin point some issues .I have checked my glucose levels as my grandfather has diabetes (I used his tester.....I am at 91...so all is good there). Blood pressure is good.Any ideas?",
