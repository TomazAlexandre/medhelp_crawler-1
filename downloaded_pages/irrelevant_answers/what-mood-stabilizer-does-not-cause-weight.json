            "answer": "Latuda should be weight neutral, and I think Geodon tends to be pretty good in that department..\u00a0\u00a0Lamotrigine definitely is (unless you're REALLY special).\u00a0\u00a0I think most of the anticonvulsants are, with depakote being the exception rather than the rule.\u00a0\u00a0I think some people take metformin (a diabetes drug) with atypical antipsychotics, and it might help with the weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0I think it's an off label use though.Abilify is weight neutral for most people though.Lithium actually does have weight gain listed as a side effect, although everyone's different.",

    "question": "I am a 20 year old female and almost every medicine that I've taken for bipolar has caused me to gain weight. I've been taking Viibryd for my depression for a few years but it isn't enough. I took Depakote, and gained weight from my increase in appetite. Then I tried Seroquel, which worked good but I ate so much and gained weight. Then I tried Saphris, and gained 15 pounds! I couldn't stop eating. My doctor just put me on Abilify today but if it makes me gain weight too then what should I ask for? Keep in mind that I still take Viibryd",
