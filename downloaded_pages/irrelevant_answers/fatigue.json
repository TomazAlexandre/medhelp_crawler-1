Just driving my 10 year old to school is exhausting. I don't remember being this tired with my first one.",

            "answer": "I am 9 weeks and I can sleep for 12 hours at a time. I am EXHAUSTEDmost of the day. My prenatal vitamins don't help with energy. I've been told to eat clean, but even that doesn't help with the fatigue. We're definitely in the same boat. I have no desire to clean or workout.",

    "question": "21 wks and I just feel so drained all the time. I just want to sleep. When I do manage to get out of bed and go out with the family I get tired so quick I didnt think that was normal also the fact that I feel like I'm going to pass out as well. So I thought maybe it's because im out of shape and have no exercise in my daily routines. But how can I do that when I have no energy?\u00a0\u00a0Any one else feel like this. Its starting to be so overwhelming.\u00a0\u00a0:-(",
