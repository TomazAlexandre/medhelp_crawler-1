            "answer": "I am actually going to see a maternal fetal medicine doctor today for the exact same thing. My doctor is worried that my little one is going to be big as well. Though I was told there is no test that is very accurate. The ultrasound I'm having today can be off by 1-2 lbs. that is a lot for a babies weight. I'm not going to stress about it because either way she's coming and there's nothing I can do about it. All I wish for is a healthy baby. Don't worry, best of luck :)",
