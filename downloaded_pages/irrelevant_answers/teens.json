            "answer": "It's a very hard balance and not always possible to do. Some days are much better then other days but that's the thing with diabetes is that every day is a new day. Also remembering that even if you have tons of friends and are very accomplished if you don't feel well it's hard to enjoy it all. I struggled through those years but I did the best I could and that was good enough for me.",

            "answer": "Keep snacks and quick sugar on you. Make it a habit to always carry your testing machine and insulin supplies with you. Explain your disease to all the people in your life. They helped me remember and take the time to check my blood and eat on time. If they know about diabetes and the harm it can cause you, your friends shouldn't mind waiting on you to take care of your self. I've been diabetic for 25 years. Played all the sports, had friends, and boyfriends. I did it all because I took care of my self and had family and friends that supported that.\u00a0\u00a0I really recommend holding off on sex....the emotions that go into it can take a number on your sugars and if you get pregnant and your blood sugars are out of control, you can seriously harm your self and deform your baby or even kill it.",
