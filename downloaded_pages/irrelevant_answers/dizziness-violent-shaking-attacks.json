            "answer": "\"...result of her sugar coming down quickly\"Sudden spikes and drops in glucose levels can cause drastic changes such as fainting. One has to be not only careful about what they are eating/drinkin, but also monitor and keep track as to not cause this to happen. Proper nutrition, moderate exercise, and weight control are the answers to controlling diabetes.Since you kept it a secret as to what \"get her levels to manageble levels.\" means, what her preprandial and postprandial levels are, or what your wife and you are doing to control her diabetes, or whether she is at proper weight numbers, no further thoughts can be provided.In the meantime, please don't let her get behind the wheel of car until this is resolved and she gets her diabetes under control.",

            "answer": "Is your wife seeing a endocrinologist or a GP?\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed by a GP but found a specialist as soon as possible.\u00a0\u00a0He had me see a nutritionist, and\u00a0\u00a0a lot of food info about carbs and fats etc were discussed\u00a0\u00a0but it did take time for me to learn what affected me foodwise.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone is different, but some carbs cause spikes in bs levels and some are slower and therefore dont cause extremes in bs levels.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe\u00a0\u00a0if she would check into the glycemic index it may help in making food selections. Diabetes is a balancing act, and what one diabetic can eat another may find it really causes a spike in bs for them.\u00a0\u00a0When your bs is taking a dive\u00a0\u00a0you may feel really awful.\u00a0\u00a0.. Also making sure to eat small meals through out the day and not just three meals.\u00a0\u00a0But the real question is does you wifes doctor know she is having these issues?\u00a0\u00a0Is it maybe a possibility her meds need to be reevaluated?\u00a0\u00a0This should be mentioned to her doctor if it hasnt been already.",

    "question": "my wife has been battling Diabetes for years now. At first we had bad problems with bringing her suger down from 300 to 400. We have changed doctors and meds and now can get her levels to manageble levels. She has spells of bad dizziness violent shaking and she almost passes out. More often then not it si as a result of her sugar coming down quickly, but today was different. She just had blood work done and everything was fine but I am afraid she is going to fall and hurt herself. Any Thoughts?Richard",
