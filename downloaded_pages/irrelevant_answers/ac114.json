            "answer": "An A1c of 14% equals a daily glucose of 355.1 mg/dl. The daily average should be under 125 mg/dl, while fasting it is below 99 mg/dl. Was this a home test or at a doctors office? I ask because this is dangerously high and will lead to severe diabetes complications unless you take immediate action to get your blood glucose numbers arrested and under control. You can also start by maintaining proper weight, exercising daily, and eating a proper diabetes nutrition.",

            "answer": "I agree. You are not screwed, but you need to get to work immediately getting those numbers down. You need to see your doctor, or better yet a diabetic educator and endo and develop a plan which will include weight loss if needed, exercise and carb reduction. My guess is your doctor will also put you on an oral medication to get those numbers down. Begin testing on a regular basis. You want your fastings to get down under 100 and your numbers two hours after meals under 140. Testing after meals will also help you recognize what (and how much) you can eat. If your numbers stay over 300 and you begin to feel flu like symptoms or vomiting you need to go to the ER as this could be DKA. (not common in type 2's but does happen)",
