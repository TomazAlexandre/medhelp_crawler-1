            "answer": "Hello Pchis,So sorry for the delayed response.\u00a0\u00a0I am a mother of a boy living with type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Charlie is 10 and was dxd at age 3.\u00a0\u00a0My sister has type 1, as well and was diagnosed at age 24....she is now 33.Here is some info. I found:While natural sweeteners aren't nutritional bell ringers, they are generally considered to produce less of a shock to the body's blood sugar level because among the nutrients found in whole food sugars are necessary minerals that help with sugar metabolism.I am really unsure of all of the answers.\u00a0\u00a0My son is now on a pump and has never been a major junk food nut, but, now we are way more flexible with his food because he can enter the amt. of carbs into his pump.Does your Endocrinologist possibly have a nutritionist on staff or possibly he or she can refer you to one.\u00a0\u00a0Your questions are VERY good ones, but I would be guessing and I do not like to do so.I am certain you will receive comments on your questions and this is something I am going to look into myself ofr my son's benefit.\u00a0\u00a0I will re-post if I find some pertinenet information regarding natural and refined sugar.SS",

            "answer": "I'm another volunteer and agree with SS that it'd be good for you check in with a nutritionist who specializes in diabetes care.I think that your own BG tests will reveal how much grape juice & other highly concentrated sugars you can handle while staying within your target BG ranges.\u00a0\u00a0I can't say that I've noticed much of difference between having 15-30 carbo grams from, say honey or juice or other natural/healthy sources or getting the same amount from a small pile of jelly beans (all refined sugar).\u00a0\u00a0I don't eat much of either group, and would look to them to help treat low or -- perhaps a small amount for a treat.Each of us is on a customized treatment plan that includes not only carbos, but also exercise, meds, and insulin.\u00a0\u00a0How we handle certain foods seems to vary widely, too.\u00a0\u00a0I know DMers who can't eat pasta, for example, without a signficant spike in their BG.\u00a0\u00a0Others do fine with pasta (preparation matters) but have trouble with potatoes.This sure isn't easy!",

I just ate 2 pears for breakfast but I would rather have had biscuits and gravy. My question is with the sugar content in the pears would I be better off eating my biscuits and gravy?",

    "question": "I am drinking 100% grapejuice. The label says that there is 40 grams of sugar in an 8 oz glass of juice. There are 4 grams of refined sugar in a teaspoon.That would mean we are talking about 10 teaspoons of sugar if refined sugar was added to this juice. The manufacturer told me it is natural sugar we are talking about in the juice meaning the grapes are just squeezed.How does refined sugar differ from natural sugar and is 40 grams of natural sugar too much for someone? Is there a certain amount of grams of natural sugar a person should have everyday? How much is too much of either sugars? What is the daily allowance?",
