            "answer": "Dear PainAllTheTime,Your screen name says it all and my heart goes out to you.\u00a0\u00a0As you probably know, we're all volunteers here and so you need to check out any good ideas with your doctors (it's not all bad that they feel like family!).I'm not certain what RSD, altho' I found a few medical references on something with those initials.\u00a0\u00a0Is RSD related to having diabetes?Gastro is the unkindest of the diabetes complications.\u00a0\u00a0It takes tremendous patience to manage the very simple diet and still function.\u00a0\u00a0I have read/heard about some very new surgery where a stimulator is placed somewhere in the stomach to get things moving more normally.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently, docs have performed this surgery for a few years, but I don't know what the criteria are to be a candidate for it.\u00a0\u00a0Seems that you've had plenty of surgeries already.Lack of sleep likely makes everything during day more difficult, too.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps your docs have some better ideas on sleep-enhancing meds?\u00a0\u00a0For many of us, we can handle more of life's ups 'n' downs after a reasonable night's sleep than we can handle when we're chronically exhausted from lack of good rest.While I know very little about Eastern medicine like accupuncture, chinese medicine, yoga, etc. I do know folks who have had had difficult problems eased with these techniques.\u00a0\u00a0It's also tough to separate quacks from skilled practitioners adn their advertising doesn't help us.\u00a0\u00a0Try asking your docs, family members, pals, folks from church if they can recommend someone.As to whether you'll be healthy enough to endure a pregnancy, I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0Whether you'll be healthy enough to raise a baby, however, is a different question.\u00a0\u00a0Many folks with chronic diseases choose to adopt babies instead of passing along their own genetics.\u00a0\u00a0If you have love to give a child, there are few greater gifts than to open your heart to a child who has no one in this life ... and to give them the miracle of second chance to be loved.Good luck -- I hope that some of this has been helpful for you and that before long, you'll feel better.",

            "answer": "Thanks so very much!!\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to say that I am not a Diabetic, on that note I can't seem to find anything on this Gastroparesis unless I am on a site for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This is not the thing to have when a person is already being faced with so many other medical things (but this is when they happen).\u00a0\u00a0The RSD is Reflex Symthetic Distraphy it involves the nevers in the limbs.\u00a0\u00a0I have it in both of my legs following a knee injury that happened to me while working.\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to say thank you again for sending me what you know about all this.\u00a0\u00a0Any help too me is Good help.\u00a0\u00a0On the baby thing I guess being so young and longing to be a \"mom\" I always hope that I know before the new doctors say anything about the one thing I want\u00a0\u00a0so bad.",

            "answer": "I too have gastroparesis and am not a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I also have no known cause for it, which is becoming more and more common for young people.\u00a0\u00a0Gastroparesis can come in several degrees of severity.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know how bad yours is, but mine is helped tremendously by a steady prescription of prilosec and an occassional pepto-bismo dose.\u00a0\u00a0I also eat at constant intervals.\u00a0\u00a0Every time my stomach starts to burn (which is on regular hourly intervals), I try to eat something small.\u00a0\u00a0I have managed my discomfort that way.\u00a0\u00a0Some days are pretty symptom free.\u00a0\u00a0Other days, I have continual discomfort in my stomach. I just sort of accept it and deal with it.\u00a0\u00a0Like I said though, your case may be more severe than mine. Now, I am pregnant and I'm unsure which condition is bothering my stomach the most.\u00a0\u00a0I'm currently researching that to see what I can find.\u00a0\u00a0I'm so sorry that you have two chronic health conditions that are causing you pain.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure if any of this input will help you at all, but I thought I'd add my two cents.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0My prayers are with you.Sincerely,Tiffany M.",

    "question": "I was looking online for some info about \"Gastroparesis and Pregnancy\".\u00a0\u00a0I have not found that much on the baby thing.I am 27 and I have been having lots of problems with my stomach and both my legs.\u00a0\u00a0Then comes all the rest that goes along with it like backpain not sleeping trying every sort of medicine on the market and living on SOUP is not my idea of a good meal. I can't seem to ever feel really full!!\u00a0\u00a0I know that my stomach is not working very well so the food just seems to hang out for ever.\u00a0\u00a0I have been seen by soooooooo many doctors that they almost feel like FAMILY.\u00a0\u00a0I always get the \"unsure look\" when they find out what is going on with me. Chronic Pain is the Worst...\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I have something called RSD and I have had it for about 2 years now.\u00a0\u00a0I have had back surgery, knee surgery and a Medtronic Spinal Stimulator implanted twice already. Now I have this Gastroparesis thing and it is making me crazy not being able to eat anything other than SOUP...\u00a0\u00a0I miss steak and salad.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has info on how to get through this and just to think of being ok enough to have a baby sometime it would be great.\u00a0\u00a0I am on bedrest more times than not so I can get through that.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to make sure that I am ok enough to make it through.",
