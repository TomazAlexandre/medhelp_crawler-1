            "answer": "Inflammation in the arteries is basically the same as inflammation anywhere in the body. It is caused by the body fighting something which shouldn't be there or making repairs. Many white cells mutate into army cells called macrophages, ready to engulf any foreign bodies. In an ideal world, our arteries would be healthy and supple, never becoming damaged. This means that basically inflammation need never occur. However, with bad diets and smoking and high blood pressure and possibly genetics, we develop tiny cracks in the lining of the arteries, through many years of being pounded.This calls the immune system to respond, to guard and assist the damaged area for repairs. This causes swelling (inflammation). This happens inside the artery wall and the swelling can bulge either inwards or outwards or even both. With the high level of oxygen in the blood, it doesn't take long for cells trapped in the cracks to become oxidised and form a plaque. Most processed foods seem to cause a much higher level of the presence of macrophages, foods such as those containing refined sugar. Fat has been blamed for many years, but keeps hitting dead ends. Cardiologists, Surgeons, Doctors have been scratching their heads for decades trying to see the relationship between fat and plaque. There is so much written on this and research (based on statistics) to back this up that the medical teams seem afraid to say anything on the contrary. Fat is a natural substance in the body and to believe it would kill itself with this product seems a bit nuts. Fat is used to coat nerves, to stop them shorting. It's used to permanently map memory in the brain. It's used to create and repair cells. The Liver can make fat and it does so. Why would fat be so important if it kills us. Common sense says it doesn't and it's the way foods are prepared with processed chemicals to extend shelf life.The way to fight it is simple. Fresh ingredients, good old fashioned home cooking. No smoking. Keep blood pressure normal. Regular exercise.",

            "answer": "Ed34 gave a great answer.For many years, I was the poster boy for 'How to Develop Heart Trouble'.\u00a0\u00a0I Smoked, ate processed foods, was overweight, didn't exercise, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I stopped these behaviors but not before I developed heart trouble.Adding to Ed34's list, I'd include diabetes control as a major way to cool off inflamed arteries.\u00a0\u00a0Those with diabetes will have arteries that dialate and contract often, and if the disease isn't controlled with meds, exercise and diet, it's a matter of when, not if heart issues will be problem.\u00a0\u00a0I've experienced heart rehab three times, and always before the sessions and after the sessions those with diabetes need to check their blood and report it.\u00a0\u00a0Always 3/4 of the class needed to check their blood.",
