I'm wondering if the doctor forum automatically kicks their messages to this forum when they are full for the day.",

            "answer": "As long as you have been consistant with when and how you take your Synthroid, it should be ok. The lab results will reflect how much synthroid your body is absorbing and hence the dosing is based on that.It is recommended to take on an empty stomach and wait at least 1/2 hour.If you decide to change your routine, you need to get tested again to make sure you are still at a good level.",

    "question": "Dr. Lupo,Eight years ago I had a complete thyroidectomy because of thyroid cancer.\u00a0\u00a0I am now totally \"clean\"!!\u00a0\u00a0I am a 65 year old male 6'6\" tall and weigh 215 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0Over the years my Synthroid prescription has ranged from 200 to 225 mcg per day.\u00a0\u00a0My physician tests me every year, and all values are well within range.For the past year or so I have been experiencing short term hot flashes; these occur about twice a month and typically last less than 5 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0My weight at the time of surgery was 225lbs, and I have through not much effort of my own dropped to 210 over the past year.Until recently I took my Synthroid in the morning, about 5 minutes before breakfast, which typically consists of cereal with lots of milk, fruit, and coffee.Is the short period between taking the Synthroid and eating having an impact?Thanks in advance for any info you can provide.",
