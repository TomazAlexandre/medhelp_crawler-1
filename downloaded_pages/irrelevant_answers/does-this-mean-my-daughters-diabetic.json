    "question": "My almost 6 year old daughter has been having some issues and I hope someone can help me here. We believe it's a low blood sugar issue, but I am not sure. She is falling asleep on a regular basis in the middle of the day. (Not normal) She wakes up in the night to get something to drink, and is sort of shaking. She urinates constantly, even in her sleep. And never ever can get enough to drink. I am waiting on my new glucose meter to get here. We have a family history of diabetes, but never this early. Am I looking in the right direction?",
