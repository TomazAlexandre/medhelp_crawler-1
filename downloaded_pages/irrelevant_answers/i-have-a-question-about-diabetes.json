            "answer": "Hey, buddy. I'm not a med professional, but the last thing I would ever do as a diabetic would be to take OTC Creatine-\u00a0\u00a0just a personal opinion.The individual above gave you excellent advise when he/she advised you to meet with a diabetic educator. You really have to get yourself to an educator so that you can learn how to give your insulin properly.With a normal Type 1, the diet has become a lot more open now than it used to be, although I don't agree with that philosophy, personally. Sugar and yeast containing breads are fairly unhealthy for everyone, let alone Diabetics.Sometimes they are hard to avoid, however, & that's why you really need to learn about your carb counting, which is a very easy process that one can pin down quite well with the help of a diabetic educator. I would have to believe that you're seeing an Endocrinologist right now-just ask the physician to send you to a Diabetic educator. Both general practice doctors and Endocrinologists can recommend you to one of these people, so definitely try to look into that.I wouldn't worry about your physical appearence right now, buddy. Women like these skinny guys now anyway, so you'll be in good company~.However, I do think it's important for a diabetic to keep their physical health up, no question about it. But you can accomplish that by taking walks and doing light cardio-you don't have to go for the big weights all the time.Interestingly enough, it was about a year ago one physician in particular spoke to the AEA endorsing the use of calcium or sodium pyruvate supplementation for diabetics. It was the doctor's belief that diabetics who took such would not only be able to maintain their muscle mass, but avoid any and all other secondary complications relating to diabetes, too. This enlightning opinion has not been closely followed up on as of yet, however, but I'm sure they will in due time.The doctor recommends pyruvate for diabetics because it is one of the four elements comprising an enzyme known to most as Co enzyme A. The other three that comprise Coenzyme A are Cysteine (aka-Homocysteine), L-Carnitine (Major player in Cardio and Neuro functions), and Pantethine (What the body converts Pantethenic Acid (Vitamin B5) to).Some of you might remember the hype with diabetics and Pantothenic Acid back in the late 80's. Unfortunately, out of the get go it was fairly clear to determine that it was just a smaller piece of the puzzle. The problems with Cysteine and Homocysteine have long been documented in this disease.If you do enough of the math, the problem identified in the \"Bigger picture\" is Coenzyme A. The researchers can keep feeding us observations having to do w/ Cysteine and B5 all they want to, but in this day and age it's fairly easy for an individual to look at some of these areas on your own, and one would be quite surprised to learn just how manageable much of this logic is to come across.\"So why not just take Coenzyme A?\" Because the chemistry isn't complete. There are still many different mysteries with this one, in another words. Nothing's ever too easy in science. That said, however, I'm not so sure that all of these other areas need to be looked at anymore, either. One way or the other, everything and anything points to Co A, at least in terms of the secondary complications. When the logic and pathways collide, in other words, you've usually found what you were looking for. In the case of Diabetes, I personally believe that this is it.Unfortunately, Co A goes onto play a role with Co A Reductase (AKA-Cholosterol central), which does a good thing by producing Coenzyme Q10, but also does a bad thing by \"Producing\" your cholesterol, which is really nothing more than a substance resulting from a complex breakdown in the pyruvate, calcium,D, and Prostagladin \"Friendships\".I've been a Type 1 since I was quite young. I've been Blessed in that I've managed to avoid any of the complications thus far, outside of some changes in pigment. It was roughly a year ago that I decided to try direct Co A. Within two months, my cholosterol went from roughly 180 to 140, my LDL from the mid 80's to about 60, if I remember correctly. The discoloration on my arms left within 10 days of beginning this stuff (No joke).Therefore, in my case-well, it worked. I've taken it 20 days per month over the past year-nothing negative to speak of, just lots of benefits. But that's just my case, my chemistry. Whether or not others would benefit from it the way I have, I don't know. Maybe it would do the opposite and cause harm for some Diabetics, I have no idea. In my own case, however, it's done wonders. I'm giving less insulin, my nervous system is in perfect shape, etc. Couldn't be happier about things at this point, in other words.Regardless of the fact, the biggest enemies that you have as a diabetic are trans fats (Anything that says trans fat, and many argue, saturated fats). I still believe the day will come when we discover the role of such in several of today's diseases.Another that I would never touch as a diabetic is MSG (Monosodium Glutamate-The last thing that you want to do is wear down those kidneys and adrenals). Unfortunately, MSG is not a very good friend for the body in this area. After 30 + years of complaints by several in the population, I think that's a fair statement to make at this point.Of course, the mind is another. I'm a big believer in psycho autoimmunity. I think the mind can do a lot of amazing things, both good and bad. Sulking over this or any medical condition will never bring any benefits, only the downfalls to one's health. On any of those days that I feel down about this or that blood sugar reading, I always think about all of those people sitting in hospitals going through chemo and goodness knows what else, and I come to appreciate things again very quickly.Smoking, drugs, bad diets-name your poison and they might all do their harm w/ diabetics. But I will always believe at a personal level that none of these could ever be worse than what the mind itself can do. That's why it's important that those with this condition always stay thankful about what they have in comparison to what others are going through. In the long run, it might also be that a few of us come out ahead someday, too. I'll take my diet anyday over the average American's, you know.Good luck to you now. Take care of what you have to as far as your appointments go, and you'll be just fine.",

            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry that you are having such a difficult time with your diabetes, but I do want to tell you that there is hope. First of all, when a person's blood sugar is too high, it is not necessarily because they are eating the wrong foods.\u00a0\u00a0It may be that you are not taking enough insulin or the right insulin to cover the food that you are eating.\u00a0\u00a0So, my first recommendation is that you find a doctor who is a specialist in treating diabetes. Your local Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation chapter may be able to recommned some names to you.\u00a0\u00a0The goal is for you to be able to eat a healthy and well balanced diet and to take the amount of insulin required for your body to be able to use that food effectively for energy and to keep you in general good health.\u00a0\u00a0When you have high blood sugars, it is hard to feel as good as you could if they were a little lower.After seeing the doctor and getting on the right type and dose of insulin, then make an appointment with a nutritionist to plan a healthy diet.\u00a0\u00a0There are so many foods that you can enjoy as long as you understand how to take your insulin to cover what you eat.\u00a0\u00a0The muscle building and weight gain will come once you are in good control and get your energy back.\u00a0\u00a0You should be able to start an exercise program and get yourself in shape pretty quickly once you learn how to balance your food, insulin and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you and let us know how you are doing.",
