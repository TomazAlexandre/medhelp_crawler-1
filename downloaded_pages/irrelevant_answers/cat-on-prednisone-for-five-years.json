            "answer": "Have you tried giving her broncodilators by mouth?As you are probably aware prednisone has lots of side effects.\u00a0\u00a0Before making that permanant decision I would recommend that you take her to her veterinarian for tests.Since there are so many causes of vomiting I think that testing her to see if the cause is something treatable or curable would ease your mind.\u00a0\u00a0You can always make that final decision later.There are many common causes of vomiting that are controllable such as: IBD, Hyperthyroid Disease, Diabetes, food allergies, gastric ulcers, and others.\u00a0\u00a0She should also be on a hypoallergenic, high protein, grain-free diet for the excess weight.My answer is of course only for advice, only you can make that ultimate decision, but being prepared with medical answers, may make it a bit easier.Sincerely,\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Cheng",

            "answer": "Hi Dr. Cheng, Thank you so much for your advice. My cat seems a little better this morning. Things always seem so much worse late at night. I have checked her blood glucose here at home, and she is still running low numbers in the 60's. Her brother has diabetes, and I give insulin to him. So that is why I watch her sugar. She is a cat that can't go out of the house, very scared of people, and usually wants to stay in my bedroom. So, I will see how she does for a day or so, and call the vet that comes to my house, if I need to have her seen. Thanks again!",

    "question": "Hi, I have a cat with severe asthma that has been on Prednisone (ten mgs. a day for the last two years), prior to that, about five mgs. a day. All of her teeth just about have fallen out. She is very fat, and she mostly wants to lie under my bed. She started vomiting a lot today, and I wondered if you think the prednisone has finally affected her stomach? She can't go without the prednisone, or she can't breathe. Should I just put her down? She is a tortie, 12 years old, indoor only cat. Poor thing is so heavy, and I don't think the quality of her life is very good anymore. I hate to keep her going just for the sake of life. I have tried using an Aerokat inhaler with her, but it never worked too well. Gave her albuterol that way, but the prednisone has worked the best until now, if it is taking a toll on her stomach.Thanks for any advice.",
