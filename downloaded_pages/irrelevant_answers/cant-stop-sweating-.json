            "answer": "I'm 36 and 28wks pregnant. My 2 oldest are 15 & 12yrs old. I cannot relate to the sweating, but this pregnancy has definitely gotten the best of me. It also seemed my 2 other pregnancies were so much simpler. But honestly,each pregnancy is different, and we were younger then and our bodies could take more. I feel way more nauseous and completely exhausted with this pregnancy. The one thing I suffer from the most, is pulling, or stretching, muscles in my abdomen. I hope it all works out for you. There is an Arm & Hammer deodorant you can use under your breasts, belly & inner thighs to try and keep from rashing from the sweating. Other than that, I think your body is just in overdrive. Maybe the Dr can give you other advice to cool off besides a cool shower. Good luck & happy baby!!!",

            "answer": "Have the doctor test your blood sugar. One of the symptoms is sweating another is frequent urination which could be masked by being newly pregnant. I could tell I was having a problem when I would be the only person in the house sweating, which I learned later was my body trying to dump sugar.To test this between now and your next appt. Cut carbs and sugar for a few days and see if things improve...all the best!",
