            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels), ear disorder or nerve pinched.\u00a0\u00a0This may be worsen by any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

            "answer": "im not dizzy all the time but when i am it just comes out of no where. my first panic attack came\u00a0\u00a0because of the dizziness. i hope its just anxiety but then again if it was any more serious i think it would have progressed more by now since it started almost 2 months ago. try to tell yourself that since the doctors and the tests indicate that its nothing serious. its probably not and will pass. i know its tough but we cant let these run our lives when its probably nothing. good luck",
