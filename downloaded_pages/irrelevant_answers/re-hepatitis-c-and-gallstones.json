If you do have your gallbladder removed, you may want to ask the surgeons to biopsy your liver at that time.Good luck with you situation.\u00a0\u00a0 I hope this information is helpful to you. As always, you can post additional information through MEDHELP or contact us directly at Henry Ford.\u00a0\u00a0The direct number to our liver clinic is: (313) 916-8865.

            "answer": "Posted By Mary Ann on May 04, 1999 at 14:31:44My husband was diagnosed with hep c in june of 97. Since that diagnosis he has had various other diagnosis made, one of which is diabetes as of 9/98, it came on very fast and is quite difficult to manage. He is taking a lot of insulin and we increase it often. There is no diabetes in his family so from what I read this is probably the result of hep c. In doing research under diabetes I found that it is quite common for people with diabetes to have gallstones.\u00a0\u00a0Al doesn't mention if he has diabetes or not but if he does, there may be a roundabout connection between the hep c and the gallstones.Follow Ups:Re: HEPATITIS C AND GALLSTONES HFHSM.D.-D.M. 5/09/1999(0)",

    "question": "Posted By AL on April 23, 1999 at 09:43:39Following hepatic colic, gallstones have been detected by ultrasound examination. Surgical removal of the gallbladder was decided.However, the operation was suspended/posponed following blood analysis which revealed HCV antibodies. Hepatitis C dignosis has subsequently been confirmed by RIBA and by HCV RNA test.ALT and AST have been found normal (near the upper boundary) in three subsequent analyses (about 3 weeks/1 month spaced).In the mean time, gallstones are giving problems.My questions are mainly related to understand the relation (if any) between gallstones and hepatitis C and the reasons for operation posponig, but I would also very much appreciate a general comment on the situation.Best regards.",
