            "answer": "Hi Dee - that sounds soooo uncomfortable. It looks it too from your pix. Do your docs have any explanation at all? 'Hives' just isn't good enough in the context of all your other signs and sx.Forgive me, but I'm assuming that you've had brain/spine MRIs, bloods for e.g. ANA, dsDNA, thyroid, vit deficiency, lyme etc. And what about missing periods?

            "answer": "@sdeebrown,silkcutYes some\u00a0\u00a0f your symptoms sound similar to mine,,the rapid heart beat, the spacey feelings like I am drunk\u00a0\u00a0sometimes,the skin problem,muscle weakness or twitches.The tail and pelvic bone pain I have also,but not chronic, it is sporadically for some days or weeks and then resolving again quickly.Most\u00a0\u00a0sx are always sporadically in my case..My menstruation also gets irregular very quickly when I change some habits,like the diet or go on a holiday.And I miss about one period in a year,but luckily not for six months,only two,although the hormone levels are quite good.The hypoglycemia feeling with nausea,rapid heart beat and panic attacks also often get worse before the menstruation.Do you have the problem also that many symptoms are kind of related to \"blood sugar\" (feeling like it is too low) although sugar is always normal, but eating makes it better (such panic attack feelings related to food craving) and do you have psychiatric sx (feeling like being poisoned by drugs) too?My ANA levels were also negative always,same with\u00a0\u00a0the thyroid but maybe there are new autoimmune disorders which are not so easy to diagnose and maybe we have kind of a new disease...I remember that I have heard about\u00a0\u00a0some autoimmune thing\u00a0\u00a0similar to lupus but I forgot the name....",
