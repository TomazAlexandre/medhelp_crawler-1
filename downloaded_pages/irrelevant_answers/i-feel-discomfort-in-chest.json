    "question": "Hello, I am an 18-year-old teen and lately I've been experiencing discomfort in chest. It feels like my chest is under pressure. The feeling is not very strong, but it's giving me discomfort. I feel it almost every time, and it gets stronger after swimming. By the way, I have Diabetes Mellitus Type 1. Could that somehow be connected with this? Please tell me what could be behind this chest discomfort. Thank you.",
