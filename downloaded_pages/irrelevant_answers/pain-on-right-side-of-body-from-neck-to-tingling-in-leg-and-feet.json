            "answer": "Hi,How are you?These symptoms of tingling numbness and pain on right side of the body can be due to nerve compression in the cervical region.Other possibility can be peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or B12 deficiency.This requires further evaluation as the possibility of stroke also cannot be ruled out since you have symptoms only on one side of the body.Do you have any risk factors for stroke like high BP, smoking, diabetes, high cholesterol?Take care!",

            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your hands, feet, arms, or legs.Many causes of numbness in the leg are there. These include injury to the back or spinal cord, Lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and under active thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause tingling in the knee and legs.Do you also feel any weakness of the muscles of the legs or feet? Could be a Neurological illness like entrapment of the nerve of the leg. You may need tests like Nerve Conduction Velocity etc to rule it out.You can take multivitamins for some time. Also get your blood sugar tested.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Pls keep us posted if you need any more information.Regards. Take care.",
