            "answer": "Hello,Your symptom is called polyuria (excessive frequency of voiding). It can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.I suggest you to take opinion of your doctor who would do a clinical examination and advice for needful tests (such as routine urinanalysis, blood glucose test, blood & urinary osmolalities, ultrasonography of renal system, etc).Accordingly you might need to take measures such as control of excessive liquid intake, reduction in diuretic substances/drugs, treatment of any infection (with short-course antibiotics), removal of any urinary tract obstruction, treatment of diabetes, etc as the case may be.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm new to this forum. I have always had fequent urination so I'm fairly immune to it as its normal for me. I do drink a fair amount of water, however I feel like my body doesn't obsorb what I drink as it seems to run right back out of me within 25 minutes. I've had my bladder tested and it empties normally and doesn't have any kind of disorder. I can drink an 8 ounce glass of water and pee 4 times within the hour from it. I do not have diabetes and I won't reduce my water intake as it is important for my body to remain properly hydrated so I don't become sick. I know a properly hydrated body should be producing urine every hour and a half however I can't go 20 minutes without peeing and its full-fledge peeing that I do, not droplets. Any advice or tips will be appreciated, thanks a bunch in advance:)",
