            "answer": "Hi JazzygirlI can so relate to your predicament: I've had quite the history, but unlike yourself, when the downward spiral began, I didn't realize how serious the consequences of going it alone would be.This is an \"if I could do it again\" scenario:In Canada we have community support services - there must be something similar in the US. You could try seeing your school's guidance counselor & ask him/her where you could find social workers: not just one source, but several, in case it doesn't 'click'. Psychologists can't write prescriptions, see, and they're a little less eager to shove pills at you. A good health-care professional will want to listen & talk with you for a few sessions to get a sense of what's up.I really admire your guts RE pills, but please beware of the socially hip stuff too (drinking, pot, blah blah blah) -- what happened to me could happen to you. Don't run away from home. My parents were too distracted with themselves to pay attention to me, but I was very loved. I don't know your family, but I doubt your parents are indifferent.Good luck to you",

    "question": "I have depression but I am so young. I feel as if my parents don't love me and I am so scared to tell them. I've had depression since I was 8! 8!!!! I dont like doctors after my incident a few years back w/ a doctor, and I hate taking medication so I stay drug free. I don't want to do anything stupid, or run away like I've been planning. I'm just so sad. I wish I had parents like my friends do. How can I cure myself? I've lost interest in hobbies, I have sudden outbursts of crying, feeling of hopelessness, and sometimes I dont like to eat.",
