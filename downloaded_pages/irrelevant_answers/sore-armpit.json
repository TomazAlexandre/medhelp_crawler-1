    "question": "I am a 50 yr old female who has had a hysterectomy about 3 yrs. ago. except for that i have been in very good health! About a year ago i noticed a small sore in my arm pit. I related it to shaving. But it seems to come and go now often. For the past few weeks my underarm has knots in it plus it hurts. The pain is now going into my left breast. I dont have insurance plus no money for a doctor if it's something simple. I have had an uncle die of luekemia, another of non hodgens, and an aunt of hodgens diease. Should i go to the er to have it check out? Dont they say though that if it's cancer it wont hurt? Please help!",
