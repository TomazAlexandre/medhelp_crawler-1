            "answer": "My oncology nurse had recommended that I take 100mg of Vit. B6 for neuropathy and I found that it did help. I'm on my 4th chemo drug now, and I've increased the dose to 200mg of Vit.B6 and have no signs of neuropathy. I had been getting some pins and needles sensation in my lymphedema swollen leg, and now that has stopped.Check it out with your doctor before you decide to start taking on your own.Good luckJane",
