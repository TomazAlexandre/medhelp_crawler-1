            "answer": "Start reading labels and watching portion sizes. 15 grams of carbohydrates is equal to 1 carb count. Try to limit your carbs to 4 carbs or 60 grams per meal. And 2 carbs per snack. There are very good charts available online to help you guage the carbohydrates in fresh foods as well. Also try to eat at the same times daily. This will help keep your sugar levels stable and keep from putting a demand on your pancreas from binging because you skip meals or go long periods between eating. Your doctor will most likely have you check your sugars several times a day for a week or two and then will determine what the best treatment plan is for you. I am insulin dependent, meaning just monitoring my intake was not enough to keep my numbers in control. It's not as bad as it seems. And don't panic.",

            "answer": "I was dx with this too best to be proactive. I looked up diet samples before I had my appt bc it was 2 weeks out before I met with a specialist. Calories will be different for you I'm sure but carbs should be the same. Make sure you eat 6 times a day each snack no more that 15 carbs. Breakfast 35 lunch dinner 45. 3 meals 3 snacks eat a protein before bed I did yogurt Greek kind but the ones with 15/17 grams carbs. Once you start checking your sugars the nutritionist will help you modify if needed. I still have sweets like sugar free jello and whipped cream in a can pretty much no carbs. I have found sugar free cookies. Over thanksgiving I did a Apple pie with splenda and all my readings were fine. Try not to stress the meal plan can take some time to adjust but it's totally worth it in the end. I'm 36 week +1 and had my ultrasound today my little guy is perfect! If uncontrolled you will end up with a big baby and health issues. Hope this helps!!",
