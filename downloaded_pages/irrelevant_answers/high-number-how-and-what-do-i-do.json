            "answer": "It's interesting that you kept it a secret as to how you came to the conclusion that \"I have high blood sugus reading\" when, in your words, \"never done this before\". How sure are you that your readings [glucose test results] were accurate, not a false positive? As suggested by the prior poster, first read the information on Medhelp diabetes, or Google \"diabetes\", then go see a doctor for correct testing and care instructions.",

            "answer": "Without having read the info suggested above, I have a couple of suggestions:(1)\u00a0\u00a0If you are taking medications for other conditions, such as high blood pressure and/or cholesterol, research the side effects in those medications for the possibility that they are causing the high sugar numbers.\u00a0\u00a0Discuss changing the meds with your doctor to see if the sugar numbers decrease.(2)\u00a0\u00a0Before going on insulin in any form, register with a diabetes education program.\u00a0\u00a0Many hospitals and HMO's offer these programs free of charge.\u00a0\u00a0They show you how to regulate your diet, increase your physical activity, and test your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Your primary doctor should have testing kits at no charge.Many medications come with warnings that liver or kidney damage may occur.\u00a0\u00a0The logical question is:\u00a0\u00a0can they also cause damage to the pancreas?\u00a0\u00a0When the pancreas doesn't function properly, the liver steps in to back it up.\u00a0\u00a0(I think I read that somewhere.)\u00a0\u00a0If both the liver and the pancreas are damaged, the body is not getting or cannot use the insulin these organs may be producing.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors should be monitoring their patients on certain meds on a regular basis to prevent the onset of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The incidence of adult-onset diabetes is growing higher every year.\u00a0\u00a0Is anybody questioning why?I am regulating my blood sugar as recommended in the diabetes class operated by Kaiser Permanente without medication.\u00a0\u00a0(I understand that most insulin meds work for 2 or 3 years at best and then have to be changed or supplemented with a second med.)\u00a0\u00a0There is also some debate as to whether insulin causes weight gain -- the opposite of what a diabetic should experience.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor told me the med she wanted to start me with would give me \"the poots\" and make me hungry all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Could she hear herself talking??!!\u00a0\u00a0What she didn't reveal was that this med has been known to cause heart attacks.\u00a0\u00a0I am already a heart patient.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for nothing.I agree with the other posters that you should get educated to understand what is happening to your body and how you can minimize the damage.\u00a0\u00a0Ask questions, do your own research and make your doctor talk to you.",
