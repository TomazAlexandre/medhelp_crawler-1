            "answer": "It sounds like they are being a bit overprotective,\u00a0\u00a0eating frukts and veggies is a good thing , chips saved my life during the morning sickness though . The salt helped me for whatever reason . Too much salt can cause swelling though . And caffeine isnt good but drs say a cup a day wont hurt . I eat whatever i want . I watch my diet too though . But if i get a craving for something i usyally go get it . Tending to your cravings is a good thing . Just dont go overboard . Eat healthy but tend to the cravings as well .
