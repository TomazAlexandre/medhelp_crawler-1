            "answer": "Hi!The knots you feel can be either due to muscle tension or they can be neurofibroma (collection of nerve and fibrous tissue). Multiple neurofibroma in the path of a nerve can cause pain or numbness in that path.The numbness could be due to nerve compression. This is possible at various levels. It could be due to compression of the spinal nerves at the cervical spine level or, ulnar nerve at the elbow level or even at the wrist. Once a nerve is compressed, it can cause pain or numbness anywhere along its path.\u00a0\u00a0Hypothyroidism, diabetes, tumors and infections of the ulnar and spinal nerves and rheumatism can all cause numbness of little and ring finger. Please consult a neurologist. Usually you should do well with physiotherapy. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "Hello,I am a 32 year old female. I have knots in my shoulders, upper back and neck that I can not get rid of. They constantly hurt. It is a burning/aching pain. Once a week or so my pinky finger and part of my hand and the tip of my ring finger on my right hand have a numb sensation. Not pins and needles, but like it just fell asleep and blood flow has not returned yet. I have tried massage, yoga and chiropractic treatments. Do you have any suggestions for further treatments? I hate taking medications, but at this point I am willing to try anything. Thank you for your time.",
