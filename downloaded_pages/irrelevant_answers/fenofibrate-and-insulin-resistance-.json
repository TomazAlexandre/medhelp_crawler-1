            "answer": "Your question raised my curiosity and after a short research, my understanding is that it is not the fenofibrate but the rosuvastatin (Crestor) the one that can give you this effect.See this:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20507274Also it seems that insulin sensitivity gets better as the endothelial functions gets better and this is one of the effects of the statins, see this:http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16618833Jesus",

            "answer": "Thank you for your comments and the links.I think in my heading I should have said combination of Statin and fenofibrate. The user guide on Triplix does advocate combination.I have been using statins for more than nine years and this is the first time I am seeing a significant drop in my blood sugars with everything else remaining the same.. I must say I was reluctant and so was my former cardiologist in recommending the combination because of possible side effects. So far my liver function has been OK and I will be continuing with the therapy.",

    "question": "Although the subtopic is Angina, my question doesn't relate to that sub-topic. It also does not relate to\u00a0\u00a0heart disease directly. However, it relates to a drug I take for cardio-vascular problem but the more tangible result seems to be in diabetes control. In a nutshell, it just proves that you can not treat body parts in isolation !I am a diabetic on insulin. Recently , I was prescribed a fenofibrate (Trilipix 135 mg) along with Crestor. My cardio wanted this for helping in getting my triglycerides down.I have not had a lipid profile done since starting on this med two months ago. However, since being a diabetic , I check my blood glucose (BG) many times during the day and what I am noticing is a clear trend in the BG numbers going lower at least over the\u00a0\u00a0last month or so. I have not changed my diet or exercise routine from what I was doing before.I read somewhere that fenofibrates reduce insulin resistance or increase insulin sensitivity. Is that what I am seeing ? Does anyone else have a similar experience ?Thanks.",
