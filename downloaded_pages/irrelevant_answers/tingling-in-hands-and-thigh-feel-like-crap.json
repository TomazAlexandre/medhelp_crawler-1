            "answer": "Dear tb,Yes the symptoms you describe could well be diabetes. The tingling in your hands and thighs could be from diabetes nerve damage and untreated diabetes does lead to peeing more than normal. You may want to check in with a doctor just to see exactly what it may be as other things may be at play here. But either way the quicker you start taking care of it the better for you.i have had diabetes for 31 years now and i see a bunch of different doctor quite regularly just so as it is the time i may develop complications quicker and they are keeping an eye on it just so they can catch them when they are more treatable.And don't be too dismayed as they have made big improvements in the care of diabetes. They told me when i first became diabetic they told me i wouldn't live 30 years with it and they'd have been right had they not made changes with diabetes care. And though they'll want you to change your diet an diabetic diet is really only a healthy diet they want everyone to follow.good luck and i hope things work out well, bret",

            "answer": "Just before my diagnosis, I was having some similar problems.\u00a0\u00a0Numbness in the hands, blurry vision, plus I was falling asleep every afternoon, about 3 - 4 hours after lunch.In the 15 months following diagnosis, I have learned to keep my blood sugar levels under control with a much more sensible diet, including quitting my 4-6 sodas per day (sayonara, Mt. Dew!)\u00a0\u00a0I exercise 3 - 5 days a week.\u00a0\u00a0Originally I exercised for just 20 minutes per day, but know I often cycle for 2 to 3 hours in the evening or on Saturday afternoon.\u00a0\u00a0In the process I've lost about 50 lbs, 2 inches off my neck, and 4 inches off my waist.See your doctor and learn what is really going on.\u00a0\u00a0Get an appointment with a dietician and learn how to eat foods that will help you.\u00a0\u00a0Eat a balanced diet, avoid dangerous trans fats, but most of all get up and move.\u00a0\u00a0Walking, cycling, and swimming are all good low-impact sports (well, not mountain biking the way I do it ;^) and the short- and long-term benefits are worth the effort.",

    "question": "I have not been diagnosed, but I believe I might have diabetes. Everyday I feel pretty ****. I have tingling in my hands and thigh. When I wake up in the morning I feel crappy. I eat I feel better, but still not great. As time goes on throughout the day I feel tired and crappy. Lunch comes and I feel a little better afterwards, but then as the afternoon goes by I feel like **** again. I have headaches. I have to pee more often then I think I should. Anyway, has anyone had some symptoms such as these and have diabetes???",
