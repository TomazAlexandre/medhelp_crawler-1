            "answer": "Thank you for your response.No, there is no discomfort other than the feeling of them on the bed when I lie down and then it's not a sharp pain, but it's so uncomfortable I can not remain on my back.I did a search on this site and a heart doctor suggested it might have been (in that case) a circulation problem.Anyone else who might have anything similar, I'd appreciate your comments.Thank you!",

            "answer": "Here's the post & reply:Nancy08/23/1999I have pain on the bottom of my feet in the heel, but just on the bottom. It feel almost hot. This hurts especially at night. I am a 34 year old women, 15 lbs overweight, who recently started working out again. I have also recently cut caffeine out of my diet(I drank alot of Coke.) Is this circulation related? Is there anything I can do about it, it's been going on about a week. You're advice is greatly appreciated. (I am not on medication except tylenol with codeine for ovary pain once in awhile. There is a family history of high blood pressure, diabetes and cholestorol problems, but I've never had any of the above)CCF CARDIO MD JMF08/23/1999Dear Nancy,This may be related to circulation although it would be difficult to tell. Please consult with your local physician if these symptoms continue to be troublesome.",
