            "answer": "Thanks everyone. I'm relieved its not just me going through this. Not that I wish this in anyone. It's so stressful. They induced me early for my daughter at 37 weeks even though that's considered full term. But things didn't happen this fast with her. I just want things to go smoothly. I meet with a different high risk Dr in two weeks and they will determine when it's good to induce.",

    "question": "I failed the 3 hour glucose test by 3 points. The Dr wants me to see a specialist. Show I be concerned? I've only gone 24-25 lbs and I'm 30 weeks pregnant. My baby is measuring small and fluid levels are dropping. So I already go to the Dr's constantly to be monitored. I just feel overwhelmed. They gave me steroid shots and are talking about inducing me soon. I don't know what to think or do. Anyone have some advice?",
