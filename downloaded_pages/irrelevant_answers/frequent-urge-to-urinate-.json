            "answer": "Hi,The urge incontinence which you are suffering from could possibly be an adverse effect of bronkaid. I\u2019ll suggest to discuss the same with your treating physician also and maybe a decrease in dose or using some alternative medication may help in the same. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "Hello. I'm a 35 yr old male. I am an amateur bodybuilder with a 5 yr history of steroid use. I've been off cycle for 1 month and started using an ephedra based weight loss drug to shed a few lbs of fat (bronkaid) for a few months. Now I recently noticed that I've been having an urge to urinate frequently. Sometimes I wake up at night to go but usually I don't. I have seen the urine a little cloudy at times but rarely. I have some Cipro I can take if needed. I have no pain and my primary care physician sent me for a urinalysis and PSA but everything returned negative for Diabetes, UTI and any prostate issues. So now I'm scheduled to see a Urologist in a few weeks. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.",
