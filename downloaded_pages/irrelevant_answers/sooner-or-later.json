            "answer": "This post should be considered as a candidate for the 'heart post hall of fame', you sure gave me a chuckle.\u00a0\u00a0The topic is serious, but loved your candid response.I definitely wouldn't have elective surgery now.\u00a0\u00a0I really doubt you could get a doctor to do it for a 'moderate' condition.\u00a0\u00a0You could very well arrest the development of further disease through diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0My very aggressive Cardiac Artery Disease has been arrested through daily exercise and diet.\u00a0\u00a0I also set a goal to lose at least one pound a month, and over a five year period have lost 42 pounds, that really helped all aspects of my health.\u00a0\u00a0Are you diabetic?\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes will cause havoc with AS, CAD, you name it.I'm your age, taller than you and was almost as heavy, so I've been there.If you can walk a mile, try and increase it to two miles a day, almost every day, and don't fuel up when you get home.\u00a0\u00a0I'm betting you will feel better and get better.",

    "question": "Two stents placed in LAD a year ago. One year later (last week) angiogram showed stents in great shape. But my aortic stenosis, mild last year has progressed to moderate. Dr. said I will likely need repair or replacement within 5 or so years.I am 70, 6', 265 and have always been mostly sedentary but can walk a mile or more without a problem. Never liked dancing fast and sustained heavy exertion makes me have to take brief breaks. My mantra (tongue in cheek) has been never stand when you can sit, and never sit when you can lay down). So I'm thinking that my \"laziness\" likely can be in large part attributed to the AS. Wondering if I should get valve repaired or replaced now or wait for more symptoms to appear. Also be interested to know if its worth doing the surgery. In other words can I expect a marked improvement in my exercise/exertion tolerance?Thanks.",
