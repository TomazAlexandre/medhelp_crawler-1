            "answer": "\"He now has severe pain in the other leg. Short of another amputation, is there any way to reduce his pain in the leg?\"It would help to know if a doctor has verified the cause of the pain; neuropathic pain caused by uncontrolled and unmanaged diabetes, an infection, broken/fractured bone, ligament tear, bleeding, blood clot, and so on. As you can guess each has different treatment methods to alleviate pain. Once he has been medically evaluated discuss with his doctor pain medication, physical rehab therapy, and above all, try to get him to control and manage his diabetes. Good luck.",
