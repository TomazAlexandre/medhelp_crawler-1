            "answer": "Hi, are you on insulin?\u00a0\u00a0If you're not and you're having a hard time controlling numbers, then you should be on insulin and it will make things much easier.I can recommend eating low carb (meat, heaps of non-starchy veges, eggs, full fat dairy, nuts).\u00a0\u00a0No grains or sugars, even fruits are very sweet, no sweetened foods or drinks.\u00a0\u00a0Your baby gets your blood sugar levels, it doesn't know what you eat.Taking a walk after each meal may also help control numbers.",
