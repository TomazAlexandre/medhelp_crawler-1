    "question": "Hi, For longer than I can remember, the pinkie toe on my left foot has been numb, sometimes it hurts to touch it. Lately, often, but not always, it feels like there is a lump on the bottom of my foot when I walk. It's towards the outside of the left foot. In addition, I often have severe leg cramps in my lower/left back of leg that shoot down and freeze my foot into a weird position.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a podiatrist when it was just the toe numbness. He thought it might be a neuroma. I got a shot of cortizone. Didn't help. I gave up on it and figured I'll just deal with it. But now the lump feeling and the cramp is just driving me crazy.Any suggestions what it may be, or what kind of DR I should see. Should I get an MRI. X-rays really do show much.Thank in advance.",
