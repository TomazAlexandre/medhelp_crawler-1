    "question": "I am 26 years old and 32 weeks pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with high blood a couple of years ago, and it has up until now been under good control.\u00a0\u00a0I monitor my blood pressure at home a few times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Lately I have been having really fluctuating numbers. My normal number is usually around 120s/75 or 80.\u00a0\u00a0Lately I have experienced sudden nausea and had readings of 164/106.\u00a0\u00a0This usually lasts for a couple of hours.\u00a0\u00a0Last night I was unable to sleep b/c every time I laid down I began to get extremely weak, shaky, sweaty and dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0My BP reading was 88/59!\u00a0\u00a0I was up all night from about 2am on b/c of these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Now today I have been walking around feeling very dizzy and unbalanced and sweaty.\u00a0\u00a0My BP was 106/63 (which is quite low for me).\u00a0\u00a0I am extremely worried about these fluctuating pressures, and it has been very uncomfortable as well.\u00a0\u00a0I have a history of anxiety attacks, and have experienced racing heart, dizziness, sweating and palpitations frequently.\u00a0\u00a0I have been told by many doctors that all my symptoms are related to anxiety, but these spells don't feel like panic/ anxiety to me.\u00a0\u00a0Generally when these spells occur I am not anxious, I just feel physically ill. I have also been told that I am dehydrated, but I drink water obsessively and every time my urine is checked they tell me I am very well hydrated.\u00a0\u00a0My urine is almost always very very pale yellow or completely clear.\u00a0\u00a0I'm scared and frustrated, anyone know what could be going on!?",
