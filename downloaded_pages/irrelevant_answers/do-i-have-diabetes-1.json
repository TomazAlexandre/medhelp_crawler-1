Don't have large meals, smaller ones are better and then have a healthy snack in between your meals.\u00a0\u00a0This will help for your blood sugars not to drop so low as to give you symptoms.Cut out or cut down on sugary, processed and junk foods.\u00a0\u00a0Fizzy and fresh fruit drinks.\u00a0\u00a0With the fresh fruit drinks half a glass is fine.Complex cabs and foods with fibre will release energy slowly and these are the types of food that are better.\u00a0\u00a0E.g. eat seeded wholemeal bread instead of white.The blood sugar level tested on your friends machine only gives you a glucose reading of what your glucose level is at the time of taking the reading.\u00a0\u00a0A glucose test and a HbA1C test would show a much clearer picture.",

            "answer": "It might be that you suffer from low sugar levels. I'm t1 but usually when diagnosed patients sugar levels are through the roof rather than suffering from low sugar levels. Both my father and husband feel their sugar levels go too low, make sure you carry around some lucozade or similar for times when you feel low.",
