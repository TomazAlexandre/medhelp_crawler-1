    "question": "So i am due April 11, with baby number three. i have an 8 year old boy and a 3 year old girl. throughout all of my pregnancies i have struggled with hyperemesis gravidarum all nine months (i puke up everything i put in my mouth), i am also always borderline gestational diabetes. every pregnancy has been harder and harder on me plus doc doesnt recommend having anymore as this is my third c-section. in the beginning i was fixed on having a tubal because of these factors as well as being sensitive to the hormones in birth control, but now im not so sure. i love being a woman and part of that is being able to conceive and i feel like by taking that away i will be less of one. also hubby and i got married having one child of a previous relationship, me having a boy and him having a girl! and we have a girl together. sonographer thinks this one is a girl to. although he has taken on the role as daddy to my son, i wanted to give him one of his own. im so torn. any suggestions?",
