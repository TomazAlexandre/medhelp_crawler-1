            "answer": "Hi. I'm pregnant for the 4th time and I am Rh negitive. I have never had a problem. I have always received Rhogam at 28 weeks and after delievery ( 1 time after a D&C ). Both of my boys are Rh positive, as is my husband. It is not a big deal as long as you receive rhogam. I understand why you are concerned. I was nervous with my first pregnancy and the Rh negative issue-but it all worked out fine!",

            "answer": "I'm Rh negative and was assured that it would not be a problem. I received Rhogam after a D&C and had similar concerns.\u00a0\u00a0Especially b/c I had miscarried. But the Dr. and Nurse assured me that being Rh Negative had nothing to do with the miscarriage and would not cause me any problems with future pregnancies - as long as I have the Rhogam at 28 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The Nurse was apparently Rh negative as well and showed me pics of her two healthy children.\u00a0\u00a0I think we're extremely lucky that there is Rhogam.\u00a0\u00a0It was, I think, not discovered until the 70's and before that, there would have been absolutely nothing Dr.'s could do for us.As for the GD, my Mother and close friend both had it and delivered healthy babies. My brother is living proof!\u00a0\u00a0Just follow their recommendations and I am sure you will have the healthiest of pregnancies. I imagine it is overwhelming to learn all of this but just remember you have a wee one inside you that has been growing happily all along and will continue to do so with your support.",

    "question": "i was told by my OB that my blood type is Rh- negative and that when im 28 weeks along i shold get a shot of Rhogam (RHO (D) Immune Globulin which is used to prevent an immune response to Rh-positive blood in people with Rh-negative blood type.Ive been looking it up on line and its scarry i guess it dosent effect the first pregancy but it could effect the second or third baby and so on, like they could have brain damage or even heart failure im so confused and just scared and asking myself why is all this happening to me.Last week i was tested for GB and i was told that im in the verge of getting it and that i should go see a dietician to help me so that i dont have to be put on insulin, i just registed today for a 4 hr class where they will be talking about GB and how i need to monitore my blood levels, Now today i hear it seems like everything and anything is happening to me!!I just need some support.",
