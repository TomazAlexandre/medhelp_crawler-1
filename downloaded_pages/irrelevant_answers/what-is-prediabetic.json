            "answer": "Correct me if I'm wrong, I read your post as three questions:1. What are the appropriate times to test glucose?2. How much insulin is produced while sleeping?3. Do I have prediabetes or diabetes?1a. Test times and resultsFasting glucose levels: 8-10 hrs with no food or colored liquids. Normally first thing in morning before breakfast.Fasting and preprandial - 60/70 to 99 mg/dlPrediabetes - 100 to 125 mg/dlDiabetes - above 126 mg/dl1b.Glucose levels Postprandial [2-3 hours post meal]Diabetics <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dlA 'normal' nondiabetic would average <99 mg/dl1c. Random testing is useless. Test before walking then 15-20 mins after when your body has come to rest. Compare the difference to see how much you have burnt off. Eat before not after exercising.\"So, what's going on? I am assuming that my body is producing insulin, but requires constant exercise to absorb it. Am I right. Because it seems that while I am asleep my body has a difficult time using the insulin.\"2a. With t2 diabetics, it means that their body is producing insulin, but not at high enough levels so that their muscles, red blood and fat cells are having difficulty absorbing it. The key words are \"producing at not high enough levels\" and \"difficulty absorbing it.\"2b. To combat nighttime hyperglycemia your body may produce insulin to compensate for low glucagon [hormone produced in the pancreas] production. But that's not enough if you go to bed with high glucose levels and your liver releases stored glucose while sleeping.\"Would you consider me to be prediabetic and is it true that that not all prediabetics progress to diabetics, and that it can be controlled thru' diet and exercise?\"3a. Two things in your post says you have diabetes, nor prediabetes;1.\u00a0\u00a0\"My fasting levels range between 126 and 136 ( first thing in the morning )\"2.\u00a0\u00a0You need to add weight control to diet and exercise. Excess glucose also is stored in your fat cells.Getting rid of the excess fat helps reduce glucose levels.3b. All is not lost, however, you are still at an early stage of diabetes where weight control, proper nutrition/diet, and exercise can/will reverse your condition. Doing all three with religion gives you a very good chance of bringing you back to a healthy normal life. Slack on one you defeat all three. When you walk, walk with intention at a moderate continuous pace. Do not stroll lazily as if you're window shopping.3c. Diabetes a progressive disease? ONLY if you let diabetes control you. As mentioned previously, lifestyle changes must be performed - weight control, proper nutrition, and exercise. Get proper sleep, avoid stress and be happy. And most important of all, keep your glucose levels in check! Good luck.",

Stating \"My fasting levels range between 126 and 136\" and then say \"This morning my fasting level was 115\", tells me your fasting levels are all over the place not just \"between 126 and 136\".Your postprandial levels are normal, your fasting levels NOT. Try not to snack up to 2 hours prior to bedtime. If you eat carbs at dinner cut back on them. You don't mention your weight so I don't know if that is a contributing issue.",

    "question": "My fasting levels range between 126 and 136 ( first thing in the morning ) and during the day they keep coming down 90 to 108. They get to around 90 after a long brisk walk. I have had a glucose tolerance test done and the fasting reading was 136 and after 2 hours it was 115.So, I am kinda a confused. I have a diabetic reading for fasting, but a normal non-diabetic reading for the 'after 2 hours. So, what's going on? I am assuming that my body is producing insulin, but requires constant exercise to absorb it. Am I right. Because it seems that while I am asleep my body has a difficult time using the insulin. Would appreciate an assessment.Would you consider me to be prediabetic and is it true that that not all prediabetics progress to diabetics, and that it can be controlled thru' diet and exercise?",
