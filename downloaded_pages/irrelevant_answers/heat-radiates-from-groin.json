            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to parasthesia skin. It can be due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition or neurological causes.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms improve. You also need to get certain investigations done and these include MRI spine, nerev conduction velocity and MR neurography.You should see a neurologist and get these investigations done.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I am a 19 year old girl. I keep feeling constant heat radiating from the groin area. This makes me very uncomfortable when in close physical contact with others. The heat seems to intensify when wearing tight clothings and can be felt even from 10 inches away. I need to take either a cold shower or spend some time without wearing any pants to ease the heat. Is there any way to reduce this heat? A few points to take into note- I am a virgin- I am a regular user of pantyliners and sanitary napkins- A mild odour can also be smelt when the heat is radiated from the groin odour- I sometimes feel the same heat radiating from the bottom of my feet when shoeless, but I am not sure of this is relatedI would really appreciate advice on ways to reduce this. Thanks!",
