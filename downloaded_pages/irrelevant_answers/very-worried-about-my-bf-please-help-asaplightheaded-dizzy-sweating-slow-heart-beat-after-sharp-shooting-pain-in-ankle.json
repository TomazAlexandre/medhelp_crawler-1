            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I would suggest you get your creatine kinase level checked. You could be having some kind of a muscle problem that is resulting in cramps and cysts. Compression of cervical spinal nerves can be another cause. Please consult a neurologist regarding that. Metabolic disorders affecting mineral metabolism such as diabetes can also be a cause. If serum electrolytes have not been checked then get those done too. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Was there an ankle injury? If yes, then a shooting pain in a joint can some times be the cause for a syncopal attack. It could also happen if he twisted his ankle. Have you noticed any swelling after this?The other possibility is that bending caused a pinched nerve at the spine which resulted in the shooting pain. The pain could have caused a fall in the blood pressure and a syncopal attack.Hence these two conditions have to be ruled out. There are many other causes of light headedness and dizziness but none would cause ankle pain shooting up to knee.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult a doctor and get his blood pressure checked. Discuss these possibilities with the doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
