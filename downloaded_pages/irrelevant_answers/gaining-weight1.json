            "answer": "Hi!Thinness and fitness are two different things. One can be thin and yet fit, whereas on can be fat and unhealthy. What is important is that the weight should not be below the normal percentile for your age, waist circumference and height. If that is the case the probably you do not eat well. If you eat well, you may be having worms in the stool. Hence a stool test is a must. Other possibilities why you are not gaining weight are hyperthyroidism, diabetes, irritable bowel syndromes and malabsorption syndromes. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
