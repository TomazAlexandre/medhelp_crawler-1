            "answer": "I was recently diagnosed with type 2. I wear glasses and within the past two months, my glasses have been out of focus. I found I could see better without them. I saw eye dr. And was told that the higher the blood sugar, that leaks in the eye's lenses and acts like a contact inside the eye. My eyes are near 20/20 now but will return to \"normal\" once my blood sugar levels go down. Some trade off huh?",

            "answer": "Diabetes can be diagnosed by an eye doctor through a thorough exam.\u00a0\u00a0It's my understanding that glucose levels have to have been running amok for some time in order for the eye doctor to be able to pick it up.In order to go about this on the cheap, go to a big box discount store and by a blood glucose monitor and strips and test before and after eating and see where your levels are running.\u00a0\u00a0If they are consistently over 100, you might want to check in with your physician and get a proper diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0if you are into the 200 or 300 levels, its time to have a serious talk with your physician and probably not a bad idea to consult with an endocrinologist.",

    "question": "Hi, i just want to ask, can diabetes be diagnosed through an eye exam? 2 months ago i noticed i had blurred vision and aside from that had other similar symptoms of diabetes, so i went to an ophthalmologist first. He did an eye exam but said my eyes were healthy and there were nosigns of diabetic retinopathy..I am just curious that if ever my diabetes is a new one, won't it show up any symptom in my eyes? I am only 21yo and normal weight but i used to have an unhealthy lifestyle, and i really dont have much money for a diabetes diagnosis test so if ever i want to hear your opinion first ...",
