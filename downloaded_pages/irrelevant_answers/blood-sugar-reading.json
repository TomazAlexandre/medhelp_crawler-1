            "answer": "Without proper testing results one assumption is you experienced reactive hypoglycemia. Reactive hypoglycemia [or alimentary hypoglycemia] is low glucose [blood sugar] that occurs after a meal \u2014 usually one to three hours after eating.Try the following:\u2022 Eat several small meals and snacks throughout the day, no more than three hours apart.\u2022 Eat a well-balanced diet including lean and nonmeat sources of protein and high-fiber foods including whole grains, fruit and vegetables.\u2022 Avoid or limit sugary foods, especially on an empty stomach.Of course, further evaluation by a doctor is warranted. Good luck",

Can you have diabetes and have lows like this right after eating?\u00a0\u00a0I tested again 45 minutes later and it was 58 and an hour later and it was 69.\u00a0\u00a0I don't feel any different.",

            "answer": "Hi,During pregnancy normal blood sugar can be a bit lower and I was given a normal range of 60 - 100 (approx).The meal you ate sounds to be low carb and would be digested quite slowly.If you feel perfectly fine your sugar levels in the 60s may not be a problem (though definitely keep an eye on it).Howver you may have seen something very different (and high) had you eaten a high carb meal (pancakes, pasta, or rice).\u00a0\u00a0Best to manage it with regular lower carb meals (which always contain some protein and fat to help balance the carbs).Good luck for your 3-hour test.How far pregnant are you?\u00a0\u00a0As the pregnancy progresses insulin resistance increases, particularly in the 3rd trimester.",
