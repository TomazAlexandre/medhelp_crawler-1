            "answer": "Hi. My son is 13 and began taking lamictal and went up to 100mg and then they went to 200mg for a week. He said he felt like he had no emotions- just numb. His doctor went back to the 100mg and added risperdal and all went well. So yes- it could take time or it could simply be too high a dose for you. I would definately talk about it.Teri",

I told them I felt the meds I was taking for bipolar disorder was causing me to gain weight which they denied. Until I developed diabetes then the doctor put me on 100mg a day. I have been on the drug for three months and have lost 20 pounds. My only problem is it gives me terrible stomach upset and diaherra. Does anyone else suffer from this problem.",
