            "answer": "Hello,After reading your symptoms the only major possibility that is coming to my mind is diabetes mellitus.Swollen hands can be explained by diabetic nephropathy.Sleep apnea can be due to obesity or overweight.I think that the approach of doctors is right in getting your sugar profile and liver and kidney function tests being got done.A HbA1C would also help in confirming the diagnosis.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted about your lab reports or if you have any additional queries.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much, I am about30lbs over weight, but it's actually coming off - I have no desire for sugar at all! probably a good thing.I'm going to write down that test you mentioned not sure if she did it or not. I half expected to get Diabetes, been tested on and off since childhood. My adopted dad has it, so I know the diet. My endocrynologist suggested glucophage (metaformin) months ago. I have PCOS as well. So I'm going to ask to be put on the drug, kill two birds with one stone :) It will help the PCOS and my blood sugars. This has been a true wake up call that's for sure. I just want the edema to go away. I'm hot, dry and itchy all over.Thanks again LCC",
