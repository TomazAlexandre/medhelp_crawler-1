            "answer": "You don't drink? That's interesting. As a recovering alcoholic myself I have only ever heard that value used in reference to DVLA levels.Here is this from GPNotebook until someone else posts:Gamma-glytamyl transpeptidase is an enzyme which is found in hepatocytes and biliary epithelial cells. GGT may be high in liver disease. In particular it is a feature of biliary outflow obstruction rather than hepatocellular damage.GGT (in men) = 11 - 50 i.u./lGGT (in women) = 7 - 32 i.u./lNote reference ranges may vary between laboratories.GGT serum measurement provides a very sensitive indicator of the presence or absence of hepatobiliary disease. However the usefulness of measurement of serum GGT is limited by its lack of specificity. Raised GGT levels have been reported in a variety of clinical conditions including (1):pancreatic diseasemyocardial infarctionchronic obstructive pulmonary diseaserenal failurediabetesobesityalcoholismDrugs such as phenytoin and barbiturates may cause high GGT levels (2).The reported sensitivity of a raised GGT for detecting alcohol ingestion has ranged from 52% to 94% (3,4)._________________http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=906362931",
