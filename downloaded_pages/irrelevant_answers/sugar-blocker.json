            "answer": "Miss Sassy,That's a great question and one I urge you to talk over frankly with your doc.\u00a0\u00a0My guess is that there's a lotta frustration behind it.I'm not a physician, but I'm highly skeptical of all the seemingly \"magic\" pills that claim to help folks lose weight, or maintain good blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0What I'm skeptical about is that it seems to me that each of us has to work hard, thru lifestyle changes, ways of eating, increasing our physical activity ... to be healthy for a long time.However, until we develop new habits & start seeing some results, doing all that can feel just TOO DIFFICULT!\u00a0\u00a0It's not surprising that folks'll then look to a quick fix. I think that the hard truth is -- in the end -- it all comes back to lifestyle changes, ways of eating, and increasing our physical activity.\u00a0\u00a0It's not pretty, it's not fancy, it's certainly not easy, but it works safely.I suppose my bottom line is that it's better to for me spend potential \"sugar blocker\" dollars on new walking shoes or a big bag of garden fresh salad veges or some wonderfully refreshing iced teas or a crosswork puzzle book.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you success, Miss Sassy, and hope you'll find some good support for diabetes management.\u00a0\u00a0It's not easy.",

            "answer": "Hi again, Miss Sassy,I did a little research and found this info on a variety on pills to aid in the treatment of (type 2) diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In case you or others were thinking about \"sugar blockers\" as a way to describe the general class of meds to help treat Type 2 diabetes, this info from Joslin might be helpful.http://www.joslin.harvard.edu/education/library/beginnerguide.shtmlThese meds are available only by Rx from a physician and are completely different from the ones sold online, on TV, or in \"health\" stores.Good luck!",
