            "answer": "How would you describe the occurence of cold sensation? Is it like someone spraying cold water on your face? Is there numbness involved? Is there a tingling sensation?Facial coldness can be caused by several things, including environmental factors, neurological disease, diabetes, alcohol-related neuropathy, hypothermia and facial injury.\u00a0\u00a0The concomitant finding of lip twitching might point to a neurological cause as very possible.Symptoms of tingling, decreased or heightened sensation, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a damaged sensory nerve, either as a result of nerve entrapment or direct pressure to the nerve or the spinal attachment of that nerve, or a disease condition affecting the nerves such as neuropathies, multiple sclerosis, diabetes, etc.While the symptoms you are experiencing right now are, at the most, just annoying, they can sometimes indicate a serious medical condition requiring prompt medical diagnosis by a professional.\u00a0\u00a0If you are concerned about your condition, consult a neurologist.",
