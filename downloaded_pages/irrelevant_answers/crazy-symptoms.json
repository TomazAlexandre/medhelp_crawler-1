            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you have is probably \u201csleeping foot\u201d or \u201cparesthesia\u201d. It is caused by a block in the nerve pathways or arteries. This prevents the electrochemical impulses from reaching the brain. When pressure is exerted on a foot or leg in one position over a long period of time, it can compress arteries in that area. Once the limb is moved, blood returns to the area, which results in the \u201cpins and needles\u201d feeling.It can also be due to pinched lumbo-sacral spinal nerves or due to peripheral neuropathy as seen in diabetes, hypothyroidism or Lyme\u2019s disease. Vit B12 deficiency is another possibility. Treating these causes will take care of the sensations too.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral to a neurologist if need be.Take care!",
