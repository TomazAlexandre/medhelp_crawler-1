            "answer": "Hello!I would suggest you to get yourself checked by an orthopedician for median nerve problems. A nerve conduction test and clinical examination by Tinel's test can diagnose your carpal tunnel syndrome.Based on the diagnosis you have to start therapy.Rule out any direct injuries and bony involvement and also diabetes.Take care!",

    "question": "Just prior to Christmas I was doing some heavy lifting (moving into a new paartment) and that evening I fell asleep on the couch on my left side and woke up with a sore elbow. A day or two later I had lost movement in my thumb and index finger. I still have not gained movement in them.I went to the movement disorder clinic to run some tests and it came back yesterday with mild carpal tunnel syndrome.The doctor who read the results was not the original doctor that I saw, and when I explained ot him what the prblem was, he said it was not carpal tunnel syndrome and that I seem to have two issues.Could the mild carpal tunnel syndrome be caused by me typing weird now that i cant move the joints in my hand (i work with computers).I have attached a photo of my left and right index finger to show you how, and which joint I cannot bend. It is the same for my thumb.Any help or suggestions would be appreciated",
