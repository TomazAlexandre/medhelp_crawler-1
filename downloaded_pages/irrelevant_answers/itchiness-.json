            "answer": "You don't have to have a \"cottage cheese\" discharge or white gunk to have a yeast infection.Yeast infections can cause sever itching, soreness and burning sensations with or without any white discharge or \"cottage cheese\" discharge.We all have fungus live on our bodies and more so in the bowels.\u00a0\u00a0When using antibiotics for bacterial infections, antibiotics not only destroy the bad bacteria, but also the good bacteria.\u00a0\u00a0With that, the fungus starts to multiply and get out of control.Antibiotics do not treat fungal infections.\u00a0\u00a0There are specific antifungal medications, creams, shampoos, oral gels to treat the different parts of the body.Eating a diet that is full of sugar, having a low immune system, sweating a lot that causes a warm and moist area especially in crevices of the skin can encourage fungal growth.\u00a0\u00a0Althlete's foot is another type of fungal infection.\u00a0\u00a0Fungal infections can happen anywhere on the body - in the mouth, your head.\u00a0\u00a0With oral thrush you would notice white marks in the mouth and may have a white tongue, your mouth may feel dry and your throat feel rough (not sore throat).\u00a0\u00a0Babies can get oral thrush and also thrush on their bottoms.Avoid wearing nylon and other manmade fabrics.\u00a0\u00a0These will make you sweat more.\u00a0\u00a0Wear cotton pants and bras and don't wear tight clothing.\u00a0\u00a0Don't use normal soaps, shower and bath gels, these don't cause fungal growth, but they are very drying to the skin.\u00a0\u00a0When the pH level of the skin is out of balance the fungus can multiply and get out of hand.As a home help remedy, you can apply natural set yogurt to your washed and dried genitals.Eating a healthy and well balanced diet and cutting out or cutting down on sugary, processed and junk foods, fizzy and sugary drinks and too much fruit juices will also help.\u00a0\u00a0Eating more natural yogurt will help to restore the right balance in the guts and discourage yeast overgrowth.Fungal infections can be caught by contact from other people - going in the swimming pool area and the shower room with bare feet after someone who already has althlete's foot walked there.Don't share towels, combs, brushes, toothbrushes with people who have fungal infections.Always wipe your bottom from front to back.Fungal infections can also be caught from having sex or oral sex with someone who has an infection but may not be aware that they have a fungal infection.Good hygiene is extremely important.\u00a0\u00a0Always wash your hands after using the toilet and after touching animals and always wash your hands before handling food.Not all itching of the genitals is caused by fungus.\u00a0\u00a0Some people are sensitive to washing detergents and other chemical products that can cause itching.\u00a0\u00a0Some people may have an allergy to latex when they use latex condoms.\u00a0\u00a0Latex free condoms are available nowadays.",
