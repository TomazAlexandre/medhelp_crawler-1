Lately, my nipples (Im a female) have been getting a tingling/sharp pain momentarily. I can not sleep at night, and sometimes when I wake up, I have a SPLITTING headache -- like my brain has been up all night.Im gettign to the point where Ive coem to terms that I have herpes, but I am wondering if I have a NEW disease now?! My soul can only take so much....I am 21 and NO ONE knows whats goin on in my life. I am so afraid. Can any body help?",
