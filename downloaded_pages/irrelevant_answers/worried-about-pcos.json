            "answer": "I can't say for sure what exact tests were done, I was 18 back then and I didn't know all of the right questions to ask.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr. said that the pap came back abnormal and she ran a second one.\u00a0\u00a0When the second one came back cancer free she ordered a specific blood test to check horomone levels along with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not quite sure exactly what that blood test showed...whether it was pitutary or not or if it is just known by symptoms.Though, PCOS isn't just low progestorone, it's hightened levels of male horomones.\u00a0\u00a0There is a condition called amenorrhea, the lack of periods for 3 months or more at a time.\u00a0\u00a0That is sometimes caused by just the horomones being off.\u00a0\u00a0Jot down when and if you have your period, how long, ect...and take it to the Dr. when you go to your next visit.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it can be fixed by just taking bc...sometimes surgery.\u00a0\u00a0If you're into the herbal health, look into chasteberry, black cohosh, and red clover tea...though just be careful with the clover.\u00a0\u00a0Take that thee cups a day for three weeks and then skip a week.\u00a0\u00a0It can be dangerous in consistant dosages esp. if there's risk of breast cancer in the family.Unless you've had more symptoms of PCOS, like facial hair, male pattern hair growth, darker hair than normal on your thighs, \"apple shape\" weight gain that is extremely difficult to lose, depression, arthritis, hyperglycemia, migraines......chances are your horomones just need a helping hand to do what they need to. :)Hope I've helped...let me know if you need anything else~AmberRose",

    "question": "I have PCOS and have little luck with doctors...all of them want to put me on birthcontrol...and it has not had very good effects because the problem is with the pituatary instead of just having cysts.\u00a0\u00a0I've been taking herbal meds, and have been very careful in researching...but now I'm passing large hunks of bloody tissue in the period that has started.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's kind of a rare syndrom...but if anyone has any information that might be able to help....I'd appreciate it...it's kind of terrifying.",
