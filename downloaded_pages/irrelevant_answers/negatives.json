            "answer": "Hi Willibert,I'm glad to read you're taking better care of yourself these days.\u00a0\u00a0It's tough on munchkins to understand \"in the future there might be damage,\" but as a young man, it's clear you understand that now.I have had diabetes since I was a teen and now I'm 48 and -- most of the time, if folks didn't know I have Type 1, they wouldn't know.I hope you're being followed by an endocrinologist and that periodically you haul yerself off to see a CDE (certified diabetes educator).\u00a0\u00a0There's been so many advances in diabetes treatment over the years and your endo & CDE are likely to be keeping very current.\u00a0\u00a0I have just followed my own advice, after nearly 10 years of not seeing a CDE regularly ... WOW!\u00a0\u00a0how great to learn some new tips 'n ' tricks, especially when I thought I knew it all ;=)To directly answer your questions, folks with diabetes are at higher risk for a lot of unpleasant things.\u00a0\u00a0Our risks are lower, the better we take care of ourselves ... but here's a list:\u00a0\u00a0eye & kidney damage; heart disease; neuropathy (nerve damage); miscarriages or impotence; and in cases where circulation is impaired, the terrifying possibility of amputations.In today's world, there are so many resources available to help educate ourselves on good treatments and ... equally as important ... places like this to come to for encourgement & moral support.It's hard work and you can do it.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you'll check in and share your progress ... you can have a full full life.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us DMers marry & have full family lives; we travel; we take on challenging careers; and we have fun :-)",

            "answer": "Seems like you are seeing a pattern with your student.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like she is trying to avoid some school work she does not enjoy.\u00a0\u00a0I assume when she tries to leave class she is going to the nurse's office?\u00a0\u00a0I hope she has to make up all of the work that she is missing in the classroom. My son did something very similar last year in school.\u00a0\u00a0In Math class he always got a headache, said he felt low and needed to go to the nurse.\u00a0\u00a0If you see this, I would talk to the nurse and see if she can push her back to class a little quicker.\u00a0\u00a0If this does not work then talk to the parents and see if they will help.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately you can not totally dismiss her actions, however if she just came back from the nurse being tested it is unlikely within 10 minutes her BG would severely change.\u00a0\u00a0However when my son goes low he gets severely combative and almost unconsolable, but this is very different from being a angry or what you described.\u00a0\u00a0When you see his low there is no question, have you ever seen her behavior change due to high or low BG?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe the parents can tell you what to expect.",

            "answer": "I am 31 and have diabetes since age 11.\u00a0\u00a0I think the most evident side effect of the disease is often overlooked because people are so into preventing other complications.\u00a0\u00a0Mood swings and depression are a big part of diabetes, especially if your bloodsugar is not in good control, but even so it affects us all.\u00a0\u00a0I know for me they can get pretty severe because I take a high among of insulin to control my blood sugars. I didn't take care of myself, mostly because I was never really taught how to, and I have been diagnosed with diabetic retinopathy and cataracts.\u00a0\u00a0Once I was diagnosed it took 6 months before I was legally blind...so do whatever you have to in order to take care of yourself.\u00a0\u00a0I had a few family members who were type 2's and developed kidney failure and blindness, but even witnessing that doesn't prepare you for when something happens to you.\u00a0\u00a0Even though it was a big blow to me ( I actually thought I wasn't a severe enough diabetic to have things like that happen to me) it actually has helped me to turn my life around. Anyway, enough about me...I'm guessing the girl in the class is either not used to taking insulin yet(maybe she is a newer diabetic), was running too high and adjusting to a lower bloodsugar, or is constantly up and down a lot with her bloodsugars.\u00a0\u00a0I know when I was younger I hated having to leave class and go see the nurse.\u00a0\u00a0It made me feel like something was wrong with me and I just wanted to be normal.\u00a0\u00a0My first year with diabetes no one knew how to deal with me and I cried and threw fits all the time.\u00a0\u00a0I guess the only thing you can do is to do your best to not single her out anymore than she has to be.",
