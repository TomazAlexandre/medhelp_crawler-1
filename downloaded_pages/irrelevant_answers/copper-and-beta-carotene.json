            "answer": "i'm sorry but i haven't seen any articles on the type of research you are asking about, copper and beta-carotene, so i'm hoping that someone else can give you some insight into the problem. i have checked all the books i have on diabetes, which are many, and also many of the magazines about diabetes i get. i have never had a doctor bring up these substances in exam/conversation meetings. good luck, bret",

            "answer": "sorry, i wrote the answer in the wrong section, wanted you to get the message:helloi have been experimenting a little on my own one might say.I have found that in order if you eat fermented cheese (blue and white at least) and combine this with\u00a0\u00a0huge amounts of smoothies of carrots, a little bit of epsom salt and what ever else kind of plant parts your body might have a craving for, it will directly effect the pancreas. The cheese is high in pro-biotics (related to absorbtion of vitamin K2 and B12). Also i have eaten loads of vegetables (some fermented) and some raw pressed oils like coconut, hemp and olive for a long time now (oils relate closely to fat soluble vitamin absorbtion)...i also eat a lot of fruit and\u00a0\u00a0some white mushrooms (champignon) and at a time i drank loads of salt water. Basicaly no bread or seeds (legumes, grains, rice, corn, nuts etc.) and no meat though i don't know exactly how this effects the pancreas.The amounts of vegetables i eat seem to fill me up way to much for me to eat anything else. eating less bread and adding a little epsom salt to water may reduce your sexual activity, and the first time i added it i got a bit of diarrhea, but i could feel something happening in my liver, and it was a good feeling in all.As you say copper and beta carotene is higly linked to diabetes, and i have jet to see anyone with red hair having diabetes type 1, but that is only my experience.as you say also zinc is importent for bones and teeth especially, and therefore there should be a balance in what you eat.mint and avocados are pretty nice with zinc amounts. I never eat something if it tastes bad or not taste anything at all.I also ended up using the chart of chakras as a tool for what i eat, and it is doing wonders for my body. But i mostly listen to my body's needs as of now. I think all of this is closely related to diabetes type 1.Here are some interesting articles that you might like:Epsom salt and sulfurhttps://www.westonaprice.org/health-topics/abcs-of-nutrition/sulfur-deficiency/Pro-biotics and diabeteshttps://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2015/01/150127104850.htmi hope this aids you in some way. thank you for reading",

    "question": "I had a couple of other questions for those that might have an understanding about some of the nutritional areas involved w/ Type 1 Diabetes. I thank you so much for the help in advance.The first is Beta Carotene. It's believed that Diabetics tend to have trouble converting Beta Carotene to Vitamin A. Has there ever been any legitmite clarification on why that is?I assume the problem might play into the hands of the Omega 3/Flaxseed debate, too. To my understanding, most doctors now recommend Omega 3 for type 1's, but the majority still believe that diabetics cannot break down the ALA in Flax Seed (Fish oil does not require the breakdown of ALA-the EPA and DHA is directly available). Interestingly, ALA has shown up in several with cancers of the breast and prostrate, so there might be a thought process there.My second question involves the continued support for extra copper supplementation w/ diabetes. For those that have ever researched the pitfalls of oxidation, etc, you wouldn't begin to believe how big of a player copper is w/ the body's chemistry.Unfortuantely, I have yet to come across any research paper to speak of that would endorse any true merit of additional copper supplementation. As a matter of fact, the opposite would seem to hold true. Excessive Copper can do a lot of bad things in the body. Recent studies out of New Zealand alledge that a small handful of Type 2 Diabetics have been cured of their condition through copper chelation, so that might say something. Zinc is very crucial for one's health, and copper tends to be its enemy.",
