(Good enough for me.) I might ask what they think she is measuring at my appt this afternoon, but this is my second and my bump is only slightly bigger than last time, so I think she'll be a similar size to what her sister was at birth (7lbs 6oz.) I remember that with my first they always thought that she was going to be bigger from looking at the US, but when my doctor used his hands to feel around my belly right before her birth he guessed her size and was only an oz off. Early on I was told I was going to have a baby larger than 8lbs!",

I'm not too worried though I think bigger babies are a little easier to deliver as the weight of them helps themselves out a bit and I found I didn't get exhausted pushing hard to get a small baby to move down. Good luck to all.",
