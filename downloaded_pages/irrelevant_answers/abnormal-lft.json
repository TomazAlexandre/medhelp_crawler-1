            "answer": "The liver biopsy suggests that there may be some damage secondary to congestive heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0If you think of the heart as a pump, and for some reason it isn't working well (i.e. in congestive heart failure), the subsequent backup can affect the liver.Next steps would be to evaluate the heart - which can certainly cause shortness of breath.\u00a0\u00a0An echocardiogram would be the appropriate test.Regarding aerobics and weights, I would discuss this with your personal physician to ensure it is safe if there is presence of any heart condition.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.Medical Weblog:kevinmd_b",

            "answer": "sorry to hear about the health problems...you mentioned heart failure - have you seen a cardiologist and had an echocardiogram?\u00a0\u00a0you said you had some trivial leakage in the valves (which is normal), so that would mean you had an echo which would show your ejection fraction.\u00a0\u00a0i'm sure if you had \"heart failure\", your ejection fraction would be low and the cardiologist would let you know...have you had that test, and what did he say?",

            "answer": "I have not yet been to a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0These tests began with visit to my primary followed by a referral to a GI specialist because of the elevated liver enzymes.\u00a0\u00a0The valves had mild leaks which I am to understand are a little more advanced than trace leaks but I am scheduling a follow-up witha cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0My biggest concern is that my mother was diagnosed with Congestive Heart failure more than a year ago and I am also concerned about the higher prevalence with this condition among African-Americans and males.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks so much for your concern and advice.",

    "question": "Went to the doctor for a physical after experiencing severe shortness of breath at nights, fatigue and dizziness.\u00a0\u00a0I workout regularly and am very active.\u00a0\u00a0Weight is normal though I am slightly muscular.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 41 year old African-American Male.\u00a0\u00a0I had elevated AST-84 (normal to 45), ALT-46 (normal to 45) and creatinine level-1.8 (normal to 1.5) in August this year.\u00a0\u00a0Tests were repeated in September and ALT was in normal range but AST was still high (50).\u00a0\u00a0Creatinine was down to 1.4.\u00a0\u00a0All other tests normal and negative for Hepatitis.\u00a0\u00a0However Prothrombin time is high-11.7 (normal to 11.5).\u00a0\u00a0INR was at the maximum for normal range (1.1).\u00a0\u00a0All ultrasounds were normal for liver and abdominal though Kidney ultrasound showed increased proximal renal artery velocities at 43cm/sec on right and 58 on left compared to normal low range of 63 cm/sec.\u00a0\u00a0Heart showed mild leaks on right valves and mild leak on one left valve.Liver Biopsy performed in early October.\u00a0\u00a0Findings were minimal Zone 3 sinusoidal dilatation with atrophy of adjacent hepatocytes with possible hepatic venous outflow obstruction with possible relation to congestive heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0What does all of this mean and what should be my next steps.\u00a0\u00a0IS it okay for me to continue aerobics (I run approximately 20 miles per week) and lift weights.\u00a0\u00a0I continue to experience fatigue, dizziness and shortness of breath.",
