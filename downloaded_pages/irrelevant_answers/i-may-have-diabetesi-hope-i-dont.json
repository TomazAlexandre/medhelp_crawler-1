            "answer": "Hi,your fasting blood glucose levels are consistent with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0And already quite severe.Yes, it is a double whammy.The prolactinoma could also be causing hypopituitary, which can also cause diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So it may be some other cause than diet, lifestyle or genetics.\u00a0\u00a0They will need to do a complete endocrine workup to see if there is anything else going on.On the diabetes side, the next step is for your doctor to test HA1C so they can see how your levels are on average, including after eating.\u00a0\u00a0You also need to buy a blood glucose monitor and start testing fasting levels yourself, as well as levels 2 hours after meals.I expect you'll be put on medication (maybe insulin would be required) with these levels as I doubt given your lifestyle that you could make enough changes to bring it down to normal.Diabetes is manageable.\u00a0\u00a0Read up all you can.\u00a0\u00a0Let us know how you go.",

            "answer": "\"I would like to know if I'm going to be diagnosed with diabetes or if there are factors that would account for it being that high despite a fasting blood test? My mother and my aunt both are diabetics,\"Unfortunately diabetes has no age boundaries or age restrictions. Young and old can be diagnosed at any age. When genetics come into play the chances of diabetes being passed on is high. It is higher when the child picks up the bad habits of the parent[s] and carry them into adulthood.Fasting does not remove excess glucose from your blood, what it does is give a baseline result without foods or colored liquids skewing the test results. Try not to exercise 48-72 hours prior to testing to let your liver settle down and not produce excess blood glucose.To the point, your last fasting test result of195 mg/dl is suicidal. These are considered normal blood glucose ranges:Normal fasting 70-99 mg/dl (some labs and hospitals go as low as 60 mg/dl)Pre-Diabetes 100-125 mg/dlPostprandial [2-3 hours after meal] <180 mg/dl, some as low as <140 mg/dlAbove 126 mg/dl is diabetes.Ask for an A1c test to see where your average blood glucose is at. See this link for an explanation http://www.diabetesmonitor.com/b59.htm\"Would I just be in the pre-diabetic stage and not full-blown diabetes? Since the results this week, I've adjusted my diet and will see my doctor in a week-and-a-half for further testing to rule anything out, but he does have a high suspicion that I may be diabetic.\"Your fasting results says you're diabetic not pre-diabetic. Ask for the aforementioned test. Ask for a C-Peptide test to see how well your pancreas produces insulin. Also, if you haven't had one already, a TSH test on your thyroid should be performed.Post back after you get these test results and let us know what they are. We can go into diabetic nutrition which is similar but not the same to what most people consider a healthy diet.",

            "answer": "High untreated blood glucose [sugar] levels is related to many long term health problems which include the kidneys, eyes and vision [retinopathy], risk of heart disease and stroke in men. Another dangerous side effect is diabetic neurothapy. Left untreated it can lead to amputation. Diabetes also increases the risk of having a heart attack as much as smoking does. If your next series of testing verifies you have high daily blood glucose levels near your reported fasting 195 mg/dl level, left untreated it is considered self destructive and suicidal. Not changing your lifestyle habits, not eating proper nutrition, not maintaining normal weight and not exercising daily is self destructive. Do yourself a favor and Google search type 2 diabetes and educate yourself about this disease. This will better prepare you for your next doctor's consultation.",

    "question": "Hello,I had taken a routine blood test two weeks ago, as I am currently being treated for a Prolactinoma. I take blood tests every 3 months or so just to check my PRL & Testosterone levels. This last blood test, my doctor decides to take a full blood test, so it had to be a fasting blood test .Everything seemed normal until he noticed my Glucose was up to 176. Turned out I screwed up with the fasting, since I took a protein shake the night before testing in the morning, as I had gone to the gym. So he decides to have me retake it again, thinking that the previous test was inaccurate.So I take a new blood test this week, fully fasting for 14 hours, and my blood glucose is now at 195.I would like to know if I'm going to be diagnosed with diabetes or if there are factors that would account for it being that high despite a fasting blood test? My mother and my aunt both are diabetics, however, I'm a little scared at the fact that I may have it, and I'm only 24yrs old.I am in generally good health. I visit the gym regularly, do not consume junk food, I do tend to eat a little more portion wise, but I limit the sweets and occasionally drink alcohol, but not too often. I do smoke, but fairly lightly. I'm 5'9\", 280lbs (but I am not round/pudgy, I'm muscular).Would I just be in the pre-diabetic stage and not full-blown diabetes? Since the results this week, I've adjusted my diet and will see my doctor in a week-and-a-half for further testing to rule anything out, but he does have a high suspicion that I may be diabetic.I just don't know what to do at this point, because it feels like a double-whammy, having a brain tumor and now (possibly) diabetes.I haven't been formally diagnosed yet, but I am really concerned. So far, I haven't experienced the typical symptoms (thirst, constant urination, etc.) but the blood glucose level seems to dictate otherwise.Any help is appreciated.Thank you.",
