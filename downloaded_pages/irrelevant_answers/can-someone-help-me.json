            "answer": "You may have a disorder that isn't diabetes. When I was a teenager, I was an anxious worrier, but mostly worried about my health (in my case I was afraid of cancer). As an adult, I got panic attacks and found out that I have an anxiety disorder which is treatable with anti-depressants. You saw the wrong kind of doctor. Have your parents take you to a psychologist or go back to the MD and tell him you're having panic attacks and constant anxiety. Tell her how afraid you feel all the time. The shaky and blurry feeling are consistent with panic attacks and anxiety disorder. There is treatment out there and it will get better. Until then, when it hits, stop, take deep breaths and remind yourself that it isn't you, you just need to ride it out and you'll feel better soon. Or have a cup of herb tea and a hot bath. Just remember, your fear isn't rational, it's part of your brain chemistry. And go get help for this.It does get better, I promise.The bloodwork should have included a hemoglobin A1C test which would show whether you had high blood sugars 3 months before the test. If it was normal, you aren't diabetic.",
