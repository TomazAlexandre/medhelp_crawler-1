            "answer": "I don't like hearing weight as a reason for c section... I think it's unfortunate. Those weight estimates are guesses and seem to be off more than they are ever right. Even if baby was 10lbs, many people have vaginal births to 10lb babies. I just don't think that alone should be a reason to have major surgery. Two co workers had 9-10lb babies, my boyfriend and his two brothers were 9-10lbs, the nurse at my Dr office had two almost 10lbs. Just my thoughts",

    "question": "Well my ultrasound says right now the baby is 10 pounds 7 oz at 40 weeks so I'm getting a c section Monday. And I'm a ftm, I had gestional diabetes so that's probably why he is so big.",
