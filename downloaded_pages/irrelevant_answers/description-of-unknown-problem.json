            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Your doctor was probably talking about Transient ischemic attack or TIA wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts.Light headedeness could be due to postural hypotension (blood pressure falling with change of position), internal ear problems and cervical spondylitis. Other causes are anemia, claustrophobia, GERD, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiYes, if the hypotension is persistent your PCP can diagnose this for you. He can also run the tests for diagnosis of endocrine problems. However, generally the lowering of blood pressure in these cases is transient and not so easy to detect. Of course there is no gurantee that you have an endocrine problem.Hope this helps.

    "question": "Hello,I was describing to a doctor that I am light headed at times, and definitley get an off-balance feeling. We talked about diet. anemia, etc. I even had a CT scan of the brain to show that nothing is wrong up there. She did mention one possibility, but I forgot the name of it. It is where something happens to the arteries and not enough oxygen gets to the brain. What is this called? It sounded like tete-a-tete. I know it's not called that, but whatever the phrase was it had the same rhythm whne pronounced. Anyone can give me a clue, as to what kind of thing I'm talking about?",
