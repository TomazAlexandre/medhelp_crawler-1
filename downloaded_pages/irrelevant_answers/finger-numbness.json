            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the finger symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched after that injury.\u00a0\u00a0This may aggravate as well due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

            "answer": "was interesting to read your article, i sometimes get my right hand that goes freezing cold, and i get numbness in the tips of my figers, and shooting pain up my thumb. i have just been diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, i have the problem in both feet and hands, which they call glove and sock syndrome, may be interesting if you have just the glove syndrome. it does sound to me, although i am not a doctor, it is from the nerves, neuro, or circulatory., or what has been mentioned to you already. i have been looking on the computer through all the websites to find out more a bout my condition, may be a good idea, you may get a better idea on who or what medical persons to seek out to get the help..our doctors just dont seem to be really bothered these days..it is more of a self diagnosis game, then when you think you know, seek advice to see if it is that.",

    "question": "I've been experiencing numb fingertips on my right hand (middle ring and little finger). It pops up whenever I go from my car to my house - office to my car, that kind of thing.\u00a0\u00a0Literally from half way down to the fingertips they go absolutely bloodless and numb. No tingling or warning just sudden cold. This seems to be a long line of health problems (slipped disc, Amenorrhea, depression).I saw my GP, he suggested I write a diary about it for 3 weeks and then go back. To be honest he seemed more interested in his phone than anything else.I can't help thinking it might be something serious. Any ideas?",
