            "answer": "Hello.Please do not get discouraged by the turn of events. You are certainly not getting the help you deserve from the health care professionals.It does look like your hormones are not in a balance. The prolactin is increased. I suspect the dopamine in your brain would be reduced. This has some effects on other neurotransmitters, too. I feel you are depressed. It may be a reactive depression, since no one wants to listen to your questions. Alternatively it may be a depression coming as a result of the chemical imbalance in your brain as a result of the disturbed pituitary.Why don't you try some anti-depressants? There is no harm in trying, if it helps the situation.You can always go in for a second opinion from some other Neurologist.Regards",

            "answer": "Hello.You will need to bring the prolactin levels back to normal. They are most probably causing galactorrhea. Certain medicines are available which act against the prolactin or reduce its level.We do need growth hormone on a regular basis. Growth hormone is an important chemical in the brain. It is interconnected to other hormones for various functions. A lowered growth hormone may manifest as loss of energy and drive.Your antidiuretic hormone is also low. This is the cause of your Diabetes insipidus.Did your endocrinologist advise anything for the hormonal imbalance?Regards",
