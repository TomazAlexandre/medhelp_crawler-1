            "answer": "hi and welcome, yes a Vet check with a stool sample is a good idea whenever theres a change in normal bowel movements....but I do want to add my 2cents as well....the foods you are feeding are full of unhealthy carbs...and carbs cause many nasty things to happen to kitties..weight gain, constipation and diabetes to name a few.the dry food is loaded in carbs...(grains/fillers) also its full of perservatives these lead to IBD (irritable bowel disease) in cats.....the fancy feast is ok however the ones with GRAVY are also just carbs...(starches) and promote the same problems...if you feed fancy feast stay with the PATE varieties these have fewer carbs and NO gravy...:)I will send you a site on nutrition, follow the links(highlighted in blue)\u00a0\u00a0on this Vet's excellent site she has tons of info on our cats diets and the consequences..http://www.catinfo.org/",

            "answer": "thank you so much for the advice. i actually used to buy them the pate but my fiancee who is generally in charge of groceries buys the cat food and doesn't always remember the kind of fancy feast i usually get. i'll remind him to get the pate from now on. i did try to give them the science diet dry food but they wouldn't eat it. should i try some of the other good ones until i find one they like or just keep trying until they eat it? thanks again.",

            "answer": "seannemairi is right it could well be a parasite when blood is present too...as far as the food there isn't a good dry food, however science diet although expensive is one of the worst for high carbs.....keep to the cans:))",

    "question": "hey all! my cat lola is 3 and is fixed. in the past month and a half or so she's has several normal stools with a trail of bloody mucus at the end of it. she isn't acting lethargic or dizzy, she's been completely normal. we feed them purina indoor cat formula hard food in the morning and fancy feast wet food at dinner time. I've noticed with her that she doesn't so much EAT the wet food as lick the gravy up. there is always meat left in her bowl. since she acts normal and doesn't seem to strain when she's going, i haven't really thought i needed to take her to the vet but with every occurrence of blood i get more worried. i should probably take her in with the stool sample huh?",
