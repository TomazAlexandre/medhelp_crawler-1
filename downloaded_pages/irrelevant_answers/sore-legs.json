            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The origin of the pain or cramps that you feel could be due to many factors.If it is due to nerves like limbo sacral radialopathies, the pain usually radiates from the back in to the thighs and calf region.It can also occur due to defective blood supply to through arteries, which occurs in atherosclerosis. If you are a smoker for long, thromboangistisobliterans needs to be considered where the terminal arteries are blocked, arterial occlusion is more pronounced in cold seasons.The pain can be due to metabolic disorder also like electrolyte imbalances, hypothyroidism, and altered calcium metabolism and also in diabetes.So, you can consult a general physician who will examine you and may do a few blood tests along with nerve conduction studies and Doppler study of the arteries to help arrive at a diagnosis for the cause of pain.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "I agree. You should see your doctor and have some testing done.\u00a0\u00a0I have a blocked Iliac artery that caused me so much pain when walking.\u00a0\u00a0I had that blockage for so long my foot went numb and my leg began to shrink.\u00a0\u00a0It was opened with a stent in 2002 and has recently begun to become blocked again.\u00a0\u00a0I am walking to improve that blockage without intervention. And of course I am taking blood thinners and such.\u00a0\u00a0It's good idea to find out through testing what the cause of this pain is.\u00a0\u00a0Take care, Ally",
