            "answer": "You have had a pretty comprehensive evaluation, including a CT scan and colonoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0This would rule out many of the major disorders - such as colitis or inflammatory bowel disease.More specialized testing can be considered - including sending the stool off for malabsorption or blood tests looking for celiac disease.If the tests continue to be negative, treatment for irritable bowel syndrome can be considered with tricyclic antidepressants, antispasmodic agents, or antibiotics like Rifaximin.If the discomfort is upper GI in origin, an upper endoscopy can be considered.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.kevinmd_",

            "answer": "I forgot to add - since you had a \"complete\" blood work by an endo - have him run a GTT.If you pass the fasting glucose, they won't run a GTT or a A1C unless you ask.You can have diabetes with an FPG under 126 (or even \"normal) if the 2HR post-prandial is over 200. That would still be diabetes, would still cause you to lose water and sugar (calories, and hence weight) due to renal losses when the glucose spikes high, still can cause damage to the body, and still indicates pancreas problems.I hope not, but if it were me, I'd ask for the GTT.I had a normal FPG and was diagnosed with IGT based on a GTT. The GTT is more sensitive.",

I feel it even during the night My bowel movements are normal but I feel like I need to go when I don't.\u00a0\u00a0THe only thing unusual is that every so often they are\u00a0\u00a0light in color.I was seen my my gynecologist and he did a transvaginal ultrasound and saidys my symptoms are not gynecologicalI\u00a0\u00a0had a CAT Scan and Ultrasound of the abdoman, normal. My internist then told me no further testing needs to be done but I told him I am still not feeling well and he to me to see a gastro. doc.I saw the gastroenterologist last week, she reviewed my tests and told me the same thing. This same doc had given me a colonocopy exaactly a year ago and there was one tiny polup.She told me to eat fiber and come back in three weeks. I told her that I am becoming very concerned about the almost constant stomach discomfort and weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0She said that weight loss can come from many things and that its hard to pin down. I also have a constant dry mouth but she said that is totally unrelated.I would appreciate any help.",
