            "answer": "There is never an easy way to lose weight in my experience. Dieting and losing weight is not easy for anyone, but I do understand the particular challenges for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0After going through a few lows, you often just feel like giving up.\u00a0\u00a0The one nice thing about diabetes is that it provides you with the basics for a healthy balanced diet, so we already know what we should eat.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, the key to losing weight is eating less and exercising more, both of which can affect your insulin requirements.\u00a0\u00a0I would encourage you to talk with your doctor about learning how to calculate your insulin dosage based on your food intake.\u00a0\u00a0Although it may take a little adjusting to get the right dosage, it may be easier than you think.Depending on the kind of insulin you take, you may be able to adjust your dose with some real precision. I am on the pump and that is one of the nice things about the pump.\u00a0\u00a0Because the pump only uses short acting insulin, I am able to bolus my mealtime dosage to match my food intake.I also think the best way to lose weight is slowly. Sometimes a change in eating habits is in order even for us diabetics who are always on diets.\u00a0\u00a0As you discuss ways to adjust your insulin with your doctor, it may also be a good time to make an appointment with the dietician and figure out a new diet that you can live with for a long time beyond the diet.The bottom line is that it is not easy.\u00a0\u00a0Get some support and find a plan you can live with.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck!\u00a0\u00a0This a struggle that many of us face.",

            "answer": "Hi,You're 100% right when you said \"I could talk to my doc\" cuz that's the safest, surest, and -- in the long run -- easiest approach.\u00a0\u00a0We do need carbos, we do need fats, we do need proteins, and we do need fiber/roughage.\u00a0\u00a0Most of us who need to shed some pounds have managed to create a lifestyle where we take on more calories than we burn.With your doc, you can brainstorm on an overall fitness plan.\u00a0\u00a0Starting slowly, of course, perhaps an extra walk or two around the block if you've been sedentary for a while.\u00a0\u00a0Or perhaps something more active if you're ready.\u00a0\u00a0The key is always for us to balance our insulin and activity and food.\u00a0\u00a0And as we become more active, our metabolism tends to speed up, too -- making it easier to burn more calories.The kicker is to avoid the yo-yo of ups 'n' downs.\u00a0\u00a0That yo-yo'ing actually makes each successive attempt at weight loss more difficult, cuz our bodies hoard the fat/weight to protect against another \"famine.\"Exercise is the weakest link in my overall DM management, so it helps me, too, to encourage you to increase your activity level.\u00a0\u00a0We're not physicians here, so our advice is coming only from personal experience and reading.\u00a0\u00a0If you like what you'll read here, chat with your doc about whether/how it could apply to your specifics.",

            "answer": "Think too about changing the TYPE of carbs that you eat--try to avoid the \"empty\" carbs, or those with a particularly high glycemic index, like white bread, potatoes,\u00a0\u00a0regular pastas, white rice, etc.Try to include plenty of whole grains such as 100% whole wheat bread, whole wheat pasta, brown rice, rolled oats, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Do a search for \"glycemic index\" and you'll get an idea of what to include in your diet, and what to avoid.And start walking!\u00a0\u00a0As mentioned previously, this is something low impact activity that almost everyone can do or build slowly up to, and will have a wonderful effect on your fitness level and weight.",
