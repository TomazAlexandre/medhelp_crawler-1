    "question": "Hi there!I'm Adrenal Insufficient as recently figured out when I went into Adrenal Crisis. As I'm sure a lot of you have experienced, it took months for my doctors to figure out what exactly was wrong with me, but I've recently been diagnosed and am in treatment for crisis and on steroids.My question is this: As my adrenal insuff. symptoms worsened, I've been starting to experience other symptoms that correlate with a lot of what I'm reading about thyroid problems: hair loss, especially in my eyebrows, sensitive to cold, dry skin even though I'm hydrating like crazy, my hair thinning out. Obviously I am also experiencing fatigue and weakness, but those symptoms could be coming from my adrenal issues as well.I'm in communication with my doctor about it but want to learn more as I wait for answers.Has anyone here experienced or know if issues with your adrenal glands can cause thyroid trouble?Thanks so much.-- Alison",
