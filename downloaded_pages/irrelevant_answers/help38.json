            "answer": "Hi,It will help us to know if you have been evaluated for peripheral neuropathy which can occur due to B 12 deficiency, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, nerve damage, nerve compression in the spine.White spots in the brain can occur due to many reasons like migraine, diabetes, chronic headache, high BP, brain infections, smoking, and stroke. MS does not seem to be likely diagnosis as of now but then it is a very difficult disease to diagnose and can be confused with many other conditions like peripheral neuropathy, stroke etc.This requires further evaluation and more tests. Please be persistent and get another neurological evaluation done.",

            "answer": "ive had my thyroid tested soooo many times, yes on the b12 ( i believe) diabetes i do get checked for seeings as how my family is saturated with it. no to the high bp, chronic headaches yes but apparently i need to have surgery on the concha bulosa to take care of that. but i do not know about the nerve damage. i did ask about the stroke because ive had a few episodes of stroke like conditions and he said highly unlikely probly because i am only 37. he also stated that there were two lesions affecting the frontal and parietal regions with the 2 largest areas in the left frontoparietal deep white matter. he wants me to have a spinal tap eeg and another mri. but as of yet there are no appointments made and i cant just call a neurologist and make an appointment. as ive said my dr thinks ive been having seizures and would this cause white matter also? i was just recently given a quick neuro exam and he said clinically there was nothing wrong but i needed more tests to rule anything else out.. but the past 7 weeks i have felt fine its when im not fine that i think i need to be seen. no one wants to do anything with me though when i am not fine.\u00a0\u00a0so i guess my question is when feeling fine (which lasts usually 3-8 months sometimes even 6 years) nothing will show up except in mris, but will new material show up at this point?",

    "question": "in 2008 i had an mri that stated i had abnormal white matter of the cerebral hemispheres but the extent of the disease does not allow for a confident prediction of demylenating disease but definitly high in the differential diagnosis. my neuro told me i mustve had an infection in my brain.\u00a0\u00a0fast forward to 2yrs later and now i am not able to drive due to the possibility of having seizures. i know initially they were looking into ms and he told me this was not the case. i have brain pain shooting stabbing tingling itching burning pain for absolutely no reason and everywhere. mostly feet but not limited to. i also have this sense most times i am walking on the rim of something and about to fall off, this comes and goes.\u00a0\u00a0i have brief moments when i cannot move, my legs will not move it starts in my lower back and yes there is pain. my neuro seen me 3 months ago and wanted more tests but has not since made any attempts to get these for me despite my attempts to prompt them and i have no idea what to do now. if some one could help i would appreciate this i like to go in knowing something.",
