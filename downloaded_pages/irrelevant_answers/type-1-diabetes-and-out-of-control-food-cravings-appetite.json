            "answer": "I recently spoke to a medical professions student and I told them of my constant cravings just like you explained. They said they were told that type 1 diabetics often have trouble controlling their weight because they always feel hungry. He said it had something to do with taking insulin and I plan to ask my doctor next time I see her what is exactly going on. I also have the desire to eat everything in site when I'm hypoglycemic. Sorry I didn't explain why it happens, but I just wanted to let you know I have the same issue!",

            "answer": "There could be many reasons for your food cravings. Yes, insulin can increase appetite and weight gain (you don't say if you are gaining) but that can be controlled by watching your carb intake and not \"feeding the insulin\"( taking more bolus to cover high carb intake). I disagree that cravings always indicate dietary needs. They certainly can do so, but sometimes we have cravings for things that we do NOT need. Sugar and carbohydrate cravings are legendary and they are physiological in nature. Both those things can be highly addictive, and the more we give in to those cravings the stronger they grow. When we stop feeding those cravings by eliminating sugar from our diet and reducing carb intake, the cravings decrease.Cravings can also be very much psychological. Controlling our food is part of the territory for diabetics, and control brings up emotional issues and can even lead to eating disorders. To oversimplify a complex issue: When we feel deprived of something we want we often crave that thing even more.I agree with what several people have already said that you need to figure out what is going on. Being constantly hungry is no fun! You don 't say anything about what you diet is like so maybe you are hungry because you aren't getting enough nutrients. So consulting a dietician will really help you figure out what is going on there. If on the other hand you are eating very high carb and bolusing for it, you are setting up a vicious cycle you need to break.The first key is to see if something is going on medically (talk to your doctor). The next is to examine your diet with a dietician or diabetic educator. Then look at the emotional components of what is going on by talking with someone who knows you. If you find the majority of it is emotional and a dietition doesn't help you might want to consider therapy or a diabtic support group.",

    "question": "I have had Type 1 diabetes for at least 22 years. I have struggled with very intense food cravings(even when I am not truly hungry or hypoglycemic) for as long as I can remember. I feel out of control of my appetite, even when my diabetes is under control. Why? Are the 2 related? Or am I just crazy?",
