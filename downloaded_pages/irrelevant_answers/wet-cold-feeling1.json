            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. Since you are a known diabetic, these could be signs of peripheral neuropathy or proximal or focal neuropathy. Long standing diabetes with poor blood sugar control could be responsible for neuropathy. Other things, which need to be ruled out, are nerve entrapment, vitamin deficiency and autoimmune diseases. You need to consult a neurologist for a complete evaluation and get nerve conduction studies or electromyography to check for the type and extent of damage. Hope this helps. Wishing you all the best.",
