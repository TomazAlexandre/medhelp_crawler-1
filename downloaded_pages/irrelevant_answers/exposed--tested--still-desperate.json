            "answer": "Okay lets see if the doctor agress with thishttp://www.cdc.gov/nchstp/od/gap/pmtct/Trainer%20Manual/Adobe/Module_6TM.pdfIt says\"A negative result usually means that the person is not infected with HIV. In rare instance, a person with a negative or inconclusive result may be in the 'window period\". This is the period of time between the onset of infection with HIV and the appearance of detectable antibodies to the virus. THE WINDOW PERIOD LASTS FOR 4 TO 6 WEEKS but OCCASIONALLY up to 3 months after HIV exposure. Persons at HIGH RISK who initally test negative should be RETESTED at 3 months after expsoure to confirm results.\"This is RIGHT off the CDC testing manual.\u00a0\u00a0Hope you trust your results now!!!!",

    "question": "First, I thank you immensely for this forum.\u00a0\u00a0Your answers are very encouraging and informative.\u00a0\u00a0I am 49, male, diabetes type 2 but doing pretty good with control.\u00a0\u00a0I had a high risk exposure August 25, 2005...homosexual, anal sex, unprotected, I was the bottom recipient. He claimed he was negative, but I don't know.\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea if he ejaculated, for I was drunk.\u00a0\u00a0Afterwards, for several weeks, I had a sinus infection, ear infection (so did others in my family, so then I figured it was a cold making the rounds), followed by two bouts of diverticulitis.\u00a0\u00a0I lost 35 pounds in about six months (started at 270, now 235 and holding - but for full disclosure I did not eat alot due to diverticulosis and also trying to diet to cut out sugar, at least from drinks).\u00a0\u00a0I tested on May 11, 2006 at AID Atlanta (almost nine months after the encounter) with an Oraquick Rapid HIV Antibody (oral swab) test...it was negative.\u00a0\u00a0I still have huge anxiety due to other \"symptoms\" - can't gain weight (doctor says its anxiety), occassional swollen nodes, low grade fever, on-going allergy symptoms - postnasal drip, irritated throat...doc says allergies, and I do suffer from them, though not this much.\u00a0\u00a0Accute anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0My questions are (1) is the Oraquick swab reliable and accurate enough?\u00a0\u00a0(2) could my seroconversion have been delayed for over 6 months due to the stuff I had in the fall if it was not HIV infection (3) I am married...can I resume sexual intimacy with my wife (we held off for a number of reasons...she does not know), and finally (4) should I be retested, or can I rely on my test on May 11 and move on, seeking to resolve this through counseling and therapy?\u00a0\u00a0 Your answer is crucial to me, and I do appreciate all you are giving through this forum.",
