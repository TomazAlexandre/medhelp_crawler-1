            "answer": "Jean, does you doctor know how high you lactic acid level is?\u00a0\u00a0I have read that normal readings are 6-16 so I would be very concerned with your number.\u00a0\u00a0I too have been hospitalized due to Keoacidoses.\u00a0\u00a0I am a type I diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0It was the most painful and frightening experience I have ever had.\u00a0\u00a0It can kill you.Please alert someone who can get you to immediate medical care if you are not able to make that decision.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I had food poisoning, so delayed in getting medical attention until I was very sick.\u00a0\u00a0When I started having labored breathing, my doctor told me to go to the ER fast.\u00a0\u00a0The trouble is that by this time you may not be thinking clearly and able to make good decisions for yourself.\u00a0\u00a0I was exremely disoriented and could not drive myself.Have you gone back on any meds for the diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Glucophage can actually cause you to get Ketoacidoses.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure why, so I would definitely talk to your doctor about that.Are your Blood sugar levels high?\u00a0\u00a0That could cause your Lactic acid levels to stay high as well, as can dehydration and anemia.If you don't have a blood meter, I would get one because they will alert you for danger if your blood sugars levels are dangerouly high.There seems to be some theory that physical therapy can reduce the lactic acid level and I'm still researching it because I also fear I still have it in my legs as they are still stiff and painful.\u00a0\u00a0I am starting therapy soon.",
