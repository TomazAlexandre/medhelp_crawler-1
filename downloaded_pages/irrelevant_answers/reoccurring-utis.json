            "answer": "HiYes, it is common to have UTI after sex, especially if the personal hygiene is not good. However in your case it could also be due to improper treatment. You need to get your urine examined for infection and cultured for bacteria and a sensitivity test done to know which antibiotic the bacteria is sensitive to. A course of this antibiotic will take care of your UTI.In diabetics too the infection is difficult to heal. In your case looks like you have low blood sugar. Are you on diabetes medicine? If, you are not, then it could be due some other problem.. I think you should discuss this with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have recently just started having sex about a year ago and I have been having reoccurring UTIs.\u00a0\u00a0Is this normal?\u00a0\u00a0Both my fiance and myself were virgins when we first started having sex.\u00a0\u00a0Since then I think I have been treated for 3 UTIs and I have had symptoms at other times, but tried and I believe was successful with treating them at home by drinking lots of water and cranberry juice and also urinating frequently.Also, I read somewhere that diabetes can cause more frequent UTIs.\u00a0\u00a0My dad is hypoglycemic and sometimes I get similar symptoms if I go long periods with out eating (5-6hrs or more).\u00a0\u00a0I will feel nauseous until I eat (usually has to have sugar in it.)\u00a0\u00a0Could I have diabetes and the reoccurring UTIs be a symptom of it?\u00a0\u00a0However, I never had a UTI until after I had sex for the first time.\u00a0\u00a0Please provide me with some input.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
