            "answer": "First, there are no cures for diabetes. Secondly, homemade concoctions such as \"black seed, cinnamon and honey\" never work and always fail. Honey contains fructose, which in a majority of diabetics elevates glucose levels. One must make and maintain lifestyle changes in order to control and manage their diabetes and/or help reverse it.Reversing diabetes depends greatly on your unknown glucose levels and how long you've been that way. It depends also on your current body weight and diet. Losing weight, eating a proper nutrition [broccoli is a good source of minerals, vitamins, and fiber] and restricting carb intake, along with daily physical 30-60 minute exercise results in many folks returning their glucose levels back to normal states. These lifestyle changes has to be maintained or one will face the consequences of lifetime diabetes.",
