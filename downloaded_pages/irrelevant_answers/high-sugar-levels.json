            "answer": "You're welcome radhikaro1961. Since thalessemia is an blood disorder and diabetes is marked by high sugars in the blood, I thought it best to speak with the blood expert, your Hematologist.Unfortunately, MedHelp does not have a blood disorder forum or I would suggest posting there. We're not allowed to post links to other web sites but if you Google'd 'thalessemia forum' you'll get a bunch of hits. Quite possible someone is diabetic and can offer suggestions. Good luck.",
