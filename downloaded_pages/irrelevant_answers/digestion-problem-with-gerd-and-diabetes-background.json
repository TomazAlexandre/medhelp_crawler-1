            "answer": "There are various notes on the 'net that discuss similar issues. Here's one -\"How to Treat It With Diet?Dietary recommendations for patients struggling with GER include avoiding foods that may relax the lower esophageal sphincter and or increase stomach acid production. These foods include caffeinated or carbonated beverages, chocolate, acidic foods such as tomatoes, oranges, and orange juice, spicy foods, and fatty or fried foods, mint, garlic and onions. The National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse also suggests avoiding alcohol as a means to prevent the worsening of reflux.Fitting Changes Into a Diabetic DietA registered dietitian can help you to determine the optimal caloric and carbohydrate intake for blood sugar control. The American Diabetes and Dietetics Associations recommend consuming 40 percent to 50 percent of calories from carbohydrates, 20 percent to 30 percent of calories from protein, and the remaining 20 percent from healthy fat sources. Fortunately for those suffering from reflux, consuming a diet rich in fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean protein, and low fat dairy products has little to no impact on worsening reflux.Additional RecommendationsVarious non-nutritive recommendations also exist for easing the discomfort you may experience from reflux. The National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse recommends angling the head of your bed at a 45 degree angle, smoking cessation if you are a smoker, discussing medication with your physician, losing weight if you are overweight, eating smaller meals, and avoiding going to bed on a full stomach. Reducing stress and avoiding tightly fitting clothes may also benefit suffers of acid reflux.Read more: http://www.livestrong.com/article/481400-a-diabetics-diet-for-treating-acid-reflux/#ixzz1W2EoE3sW",

            "answer": "Proton Pump Inhibitors (eg: nexium, prilosec) are a short term drugs only.\u00a0\u00a0The FDA issued a statement to take PPI's up to 14 days, 3 times a year. There is a good reason for this. You NEED stomach acid to release nutrients from proteins, release instrinsic factor which binds to vitamin B12 for absorption in the gut, and kill of bacteria, parasites, and fungi.\"The popular belief is that acid reflux is due to an excessive amount of hydrochloric acid in the stomach. New science has revealed that this is not the case. GERD is most often caused by too little hydrochloric acid being secreted by the stomach.During digestion the stomach secretes acid to lower its pH to around 1.5-2.5 range. More protein in the meal results in a greater need for stomach acid. Individuals with non-obstructive acid reflux are often not able to get their pH low enough. The LES is known to be a pH sensitive valve that initiates closure when pH drops under 3.0. When the stomach does not have enough acid, the LES remains open and acid can spill into the esophageal region and damage the tissue.\"Highly recommended to try digestive enzyme supplements to help digest food and trial betaine HCI with pepsin supplements to make up for stomach acid insufficiency. Magnesium deficiency is another cause of acid reflux because magnesium helps the sphincter at the bottom of the stomach relax and allow the food to go down.\"Magnesium plays a pivotal role in the secretion and function of insulin; without it, diabetes mellitus is inevitable.\" - Nutritional Magnesium Association.",

            "answer": "Slow digestion is consistent with a sedentary lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0I'd suggest you walk or do other exercise at least 30 minutes a day to raise your heart rate at least 30 beats per minute.\u00a0\u00a0You mention you have diabetes, and if the 300 rating is from a fasting test, that's totally out of line.I would take a Proton Pump Inhibitor and mix in daily exercise, eat foods with fiber, stay away from the inside of the supermarket, buy the vegetables, etc on the perimeter.\u00a0\u00a0I'd try that approach before taking a bunch of expensive 'natural' medicines.",
