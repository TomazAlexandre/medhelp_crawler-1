            "answer": "ok...When i was 1st diagnosed i put a little weight on. I was a professional dancer & didnt eat much before diagnosis due to expectations in this industry to keep my weight down. It killed me having to eat often. It sent me a little 'cookoo' & not only did i cease eating but i stopped taking my insulin. I became severly anorexic & very near killed myself in the process.Due to this stupidity & a lot of health issues it has taken me until 6 mths ago to get real control of my sugar levels. For the past decade my hba1c readings were generally between 16 & 28%.18 mths ago i was struck down with a rare illness called Devic's & i lost my eyesight & ability 2 move my lower half over the period of 2 wks. I was treated with many nasty drugs, including chemo & very high dose steroids. Due to these drugs & the immobility i shot from a UK size 6-8 to a UK size 20 over about 3 mths.Altho my conditions have not improved i decided to stop the steroid treatment & finished the chemo and plasma transplants...PTO",

            "answer": "As soon as I came off the nasty drugs my weight started to drop but it wasnt coming off very fast & i seemed to stop at around 12 stone (i am 5'4\"). I heard about the Dukan Diet & initially followed it religiously. This was approx 5 mths ago & i dropped down to about 12 & at this point my diabetes came under perfect control. This was possibly helped by being off the steroids which naturally higher sugar levels immensly. Once again it came to a halt. It was at this point that i became desperate. I now eat a grilled chicken breast, no oil, with herbs & spices, daily & 4 or 5 days a weeks will have a garden salad along with balsamic vinegar. My weight is down to approx 9.5stone & my sugars are almost always between 6 and 8.5. Most days i have ketones. Altho sometimes its an extremely high level, most days it shows midway on a ketone testing strip. I treat myself with a sandwich & muffin on a Fri or Sat. I have to increase insulin hugely on these days in order to have these carbs tho. I am now down to a UK size 10 & am over the moon. I know im not eating enough & paln to increase intake after ive lost perhapns another half stone but i am aware that its not good to always exhibit ketones. My sugars are near perfect tho & as soon as i eat carbs i CANNOT gain ANY control over them therefore i find myself in a quandry. I know i need to change my habits but dont want to increase calorie intake & end up not only putting the weight back on but also messing up my diabetic control at the same time.Does anyone have any advice, opinion, etc that would help & be realistic when considering my health, immobility, predicament & past as an anorexic (i don't ever want to allow that to happen to me again)????Thanks all & sorry about the huge question guys lol xxx",

    "question": "I've got a bit of a long question really & just want some insight off fellow diabetics & professionals if poss... I am a 30yo woman diagnosed with T1 diabetes in May 2000. I was 19 & had 6 wks before undergone a hysterectomy. I believe this shocked me into becoming diabetic altho T2 diabetes runs thru my maternal family (excluding my mum).",
