    "question": "My wife (44) has had a sudden change in attitude and seems to be so angry at me at the smallest reason, even the one's she claims happened long time ago. She says she'd thought of it for a long time as she currently has lots of time to herself. She is far from the family and lives with a male sibling and I am not in a position to go to her immediately due to travel restrictions. It started only about 2 months ago and I don't have anyway to be able to ask her to seek medical attention. She also has a bit of diabetes and high blood pressure. Is there anyway we could know if this is part of menopause?",
