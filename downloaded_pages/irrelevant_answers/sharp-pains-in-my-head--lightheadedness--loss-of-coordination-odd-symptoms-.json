            "answer": "Thanks for replying.I will make sure to check with my doctor to see if anything is wrong.I am still experiencing pain, mostly behind my eye and temple areas.I heard on the news recently that there has been an increase in Allergy weather here in Tucson, and I have bad allergies, so most of my problems might also be from my allergies, since I've also been getting a lot of sinus headaches.Thanks again, and I will try not to worry too much about things that may cause Stress and Anxiety.",
