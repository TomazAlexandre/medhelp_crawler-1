            "answer": "false positives are not urban legends. but if you had a standard hiv antibody test, before it is released as positive, it is confirmed by western blot exam. but if you say you were never at risk, dont even dwell on it. trust me it is not worth the anxiety you place yourself in.",

            "answer": "Being sick with a \"common\" illness, and I use the term loosely, will not affect a HIV antibody test result.However, if you were severely ill, ideally with an immune -suppressed disease (JR or cancer), it may affect a test result, but even then, that is rare.The common cold, flu, etc. does not inhibit the production of antibodies in the human immune system.Now, stop searching for reasons to doubt your testing incident or the one to come.;)",

            "answer": "I tested myself while I was very sick, cold/flu symptoms and fevering and all. I was on an antibiotic as well. This winter (2013) has been the worst, illness wise, Ive gotten sick probally 4 times in January, and am sick again now in February. I was possibly exposed to a girl I had a \"one night stand\" with and I found out she did heroin and the was into needles and all. I was taken over by anxiety for months. To get an accurate reading you need to wait AT LEAST 3 months for the HIV antibodies to show up. After treating myself with denial for the months after, (9 to be exact) I started freaking out again due to my constant sickeness's as I stated above. I tested myself using a home kit that uses a oral swab, you simply swab your gums and dip the stick (sample) in a supplied reagent and wait 20mins. Thank the lord I tested negative and I litterally felt born again. Just go and get tested, its not worth living in fear and not knowing. Todays medicine is soo effective: a person with HIV can live as long as a person with diabetes. Get it over with. Hope this helps anyone reading.",

    "question": "Does getting tested for HIV when you have an illness like a cold beginning has any incidence on the results?Could it come out positive because my antibodies are responding to a common illness?I really took the test for the heck of it, I haven't done anything close to risky but I fear recieving a false-positive result as pointed out here and there on the internet.Can anyone tell me if HIV tests are really accurate and if these false-positive tests are urban legends?Thank you :D",
