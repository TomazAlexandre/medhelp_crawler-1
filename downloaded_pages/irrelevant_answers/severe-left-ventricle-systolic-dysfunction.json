            "answer": "Hello and I am very sorry to hear of your condition. Our stories are very similar. I spent 2 wks in hosp and was released on 1-08-08 with diagnosis very very similar to yours. I am 49 yr Male, 6'3, 189lbs, clean coronary arteries, healthy B/P.\u00a0\u00a0I can totally relate as to how confused and overwhelmed you must feel. I am also told that I need an ICD, and I am reluctant to have one implanted.Do you have any arrhythmia issues in addition to your Cardiomyopathy?\u00a0\u00a0I suffer from many pvcs and have had runs of V-tach.\u00a0\u00a0My cardio has me on Coreg also, as well as accupril, simvastitin, and spironolactone.Do you also have an enlarged LV? CHF?\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to figure all this out also. Hang in there ! I realize my post isn't very informative (sorry), but sometimes there is comfort in support. I hope this helps you somewhat. Be well",

            "answer": "Hello again.\u00a0\u00a0Believe it or not, I went to ER with severe abdominal pain. Need gall bladder to be removed. After sonogram for abdomen, Dr's noticed abnormalities... yada-yada. Wouldn't give me cardiac clearance for surgery... Next thing I know, the boom lowered with this condition.Looking back, I was having bouts of SOB, fatigue, etc. ( initially blamed it on injuries from an accident yrs ago).I am not a Dr (obviously) but your need to yawn, is probably from your need for oxygen. Since your heart is pumping inefficiently, your body is receiving diminished supply of oxygenated blood from heart. ( when we yawn, it usually is from the need for more oxygen). Your cardiologist can request a Cardiopulmonary exercise test to help give you info as to how your lungs/ heart are interacting .As for ICD (defib), your EF, as well as mine, puts us in the 'severe' heart failure range ( if 15-20 % is accurate). So with today's clinical protocol; cardiomyopathy with ef less than 30% ( 29 and under is HF), warrants implantation of ICD.I am still trying to accept this as I prepare for this procedure. ( Trying to decide whether or not to get extended warranty with it, ;-)\u00a0\u00a0).\u00a0\u00a0Be well.",
