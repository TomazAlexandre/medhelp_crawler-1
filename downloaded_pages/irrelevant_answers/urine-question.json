            "answer": "Hi,Urine frequency or polyuria is not considered a side effect of lexapro.(Refer to this link:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.drugs.com/lexapro.html)Are there other signs or symptoms present? Together, frequent and urgent urination are classic signs of a urinary tract infection. Diabetes, pregnancy, and prostate problems are other common causes of these symptoms. Other causes include: Interstitial cystitis, diuretics, overactive bladder syndrome, or urinary incontinence. It may help to avoid drinking too much before bedtime, especially caffeine or alcohol.If this persists, it would be best to have this evaluated by your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Urinalysis may be done to rule out other causes. Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "So I went to my psyc. doctor last month and he doesn't think that the Lexapro is causing me to urinate all the time...like 20 plus times a day. He acted like he didn't know and that I need to take to my family doctor. I haven't seen my family doctor yet about it. Do you think my pscy. doctor doesn't know what he's talking about? Shouldn't he have been able to recommend something for my frequent trips to the bathroom? Doctor, what do you think?Thanks,LLFGirl",
