            "answer": "I was diagnosed with bipolar 15 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I always thought things were wrong with other people not me.\u00a0\u00a0I hated the thought of taking meds the rest of my life.\u00a0\u00a0I was in and out of inpt and out pt programs.\u00a0\u00a0I could not under stand why my husband would get so angry when I didn't take my meds.\u00a0\u00a0Remember, I was fine it was everybody else that had problems.\u00a0\u00a0One day\u00a0\u00a0I woke up in a phsyc. hosp.\u00a0\u00a0I told them I wanted to go home.\u00a0\u00a0They told me my husband had gotten a lawyer and went to a judge to have me commited. I WAS MADDD!!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0I ended up staying locked up for several monthes with a ton of crazy folks.\u00a0\u00a0It was the best thing he could have done.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it hurts when I look back and see what I did to my family.\u00a0\u00a0Being bipolor is like having dibietes.\u00a0\u00a0You can control your symptpoms but you will always have it.\u00a0\u00a0One way you will know your meds are working is when you feel like you don't need them anymore.\u00a0\u00a0If you quite taking your meds \"as directed\" you may feel ok for a couple of days, but I promise things will get so far out of wak you cannot help yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Also friends and family get to a point that they will give up on you.\u00a0\u00a0It's not that they don't love you, we just think about things differantly than \"normal people\".",

            "answer": "You said it exactly the way I would say it, bipolar is like diabetes in that you can ignore it and get worse or you can treat it as best you can. Even diet and exercise makes a different in feeling better with bipolar, and also getting enough rest. And, sadly, there is no cure for bipolar, just like there is no cure for diabetes.Another thing that is important is to learn your cycles and triggers. Getting to know your moods can really help.",

            "answer": "I've heard it's like Alex said... some people need medication their whole lives because off medication they will relapse for no reason at all while others can eventually go off medication under special circumstances like no significant stress in their life but you know... the instance of the person and that life situation are rare and there's the problem where significant stress can occur beyond your control like a loved one dying or suffering a terminal illness or you obtaining a physical handicap from an accident or something which can be psychologically distressing especially at first and even at times after you come to terms with it like anything of that nature and then there's even some who can get better permanently after temporary treatment or even without it but I bet that's probably even rarer.",

            "answer": "I just thought to add that you should follow your psychiatrist's treatment instructions and I heard a psychiatrist who has good patient ratings say you don't have to be on medication forever but I think some of them aren't willing to take the chance.\u00a0\u00a0More often than not even if you're taken off treatment you'll still be checked up on from time to time for the rest of your life.",

            "answer": "Yeah, pretty much if they just put someone on an antidepressant alone who's bipolar without a mood stabilizer they end up becoming manic.\u00a0\u00a0I heard Lithium is supposed to treat depression and mania well at the same time but it's got what can be some major downsides in it's own right.",
