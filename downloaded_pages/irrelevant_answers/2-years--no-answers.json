            "answer": "I too have hypothyroidism - Hashimoto's thyroiditis. I also have autoimmune pernicious anaemia, vitiligo and alopecia areta.\u00a0\u00a0Those naughty genes~! :)The following info is from the book \"The Everything Guide To Thyroid Disease\" by Theodore C. Friedman, MD, PhD and Winnie Yu Scherer:\"Although the majority of people with Hashimoto's will not develop any other disorders, it's important to know what some of these autoimmune conditions are in case you do start to experience symptoms. Keep in mind, too, that you may be more likely to develop Hashimoto's if you have one of these other conditions.Type 1 diabetesPernicious AnaemiaAddison's DiseaseVitiligoCeliac DiseaseAlopecia AretaSystematic Lupus Erthematosus (SLE)Rheumatoid ArthritisSjogren's SyndromeInflammatory Bowel DiseaseMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\"",

            "answer": "Yes I love my endocrinologist, she feels terrible that she doesn't know what she can do to help me. I have a nodule on my thyroid but on my last ultrasound it showed to have gotten smaller so it's small now. Apart from Type 1 diabetes and hashimoto's I have IBS and GERD. I take prozac, synthroid, seasonale and vitamin D.Yeah my endo is aware of the fever and the labs. For the high RBC she sent me to a hematologist, and the hematologist did a bit of additional testing and didn't find anything so that was that. :(Thanks for your help!",

Sweden's new dietary guidelines is LCHF to combat the obesity and type 2 diabetes epidemic.Diet Doctor One Year on an LCHF Diet with Type 1 Diabetes...\"How does an LCHF diet work with type 1 diabetes? Here\u2019s a one-year update:Today I celebrate 1 year with LCHF, or I could say that I celebrate 1 year in good health! I can certainly endorse the LCHF diet as being good for type 1 diabetics.Besides a more stable blood sugar and a more easily managed diabetes, I\u2019ve gotten rid of pain in my legs, headaches, GI problems, and constant throat infections. Previously, I had recurring yeast infections, but during this past year I haven\u2019t had a single one!I only need one injection daily, instead of the previous 5-9. I eat delicious food, and I don\u2019t miss anything. I have more energy and I\u2019m happier than ever before! During the past year I\u2019ve also gotten to know, and come in contact with, a lot of great people through Instagram and my blog!I could go on about more positive things, but now I\u2019m off to make dinner. A fatty, smoked rainbow trout to honor the day!\"",

    "question": "The title pretty much sums it up, I'm a 21 year old girl and have been sick for two years with very few answers. It's to the point where I've been unable to work or go to school for about a year and spend most of my time either stuck at home or in bed. I've seen many specialists and no one can figure anything out, and I'm getting pretty fed up!Some background: I have type 1 diabetes and hypothyroidism, that are both controlled with medication.My most bothersome symptoms are almost constant low grade fevers, terrible night sweats, weakness, extreme fatigue, headaches and a strange feeling of pressure in my neck under my jaw. There are more but those are the ones that effect me the most.I've had many tests and the only things that are always abnormal are my red blood cell count (high) and my lymphocytes (low). Everything else is normal. Which is why no one knows what to do with me. I know that something must have been missed by doctors in the last couple of years for me to be this sick. I'm not quite sure what to do.Does anyone have any ideas/suggestions?",
