            "answer": "Have you ever received any type of diagnosis for the high ANA, and major symptoms? Lupus is one possibility (you can have it with no rash ever), as is scleroderma (sine sclerosis type if you have no major skin problems). There are 80 different autoimmune diseases, any of which can attack multiple body systems. You say that in 1991 it was your 1st m/c, and that with your pg in 2004 you got heparin shots. Did you have more m/c between? How many? Did anyone ever tell you that you have APS (antiphospholipid antibody syndrome)?",
