    "question": "I woke up this morning with a pain in the outer corner of my right eye. Its not the rough type of feeling when you get something in it, its a bit sharper but not a stabbing pain. Is a little worse if I close my eye as I feel it around my eye socket as well. Just to note, I have diabetes retinopathy and swelling in this eye which I'm having a procedure on in just over a week. I don't know what this procedure is called but I'm having a needle into my eyeball through my temple as laser didn't work.I did a lot of research to try and find out about this procedure yesterday (didn't find it) and found all sorts of stuff that wasn't good so I'm unsure if I'm overreacting due to what I found out or I have cause to be worried.",
