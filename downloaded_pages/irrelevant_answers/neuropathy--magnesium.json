            "answer": "Potassium and Magnesium would not help her pain. If she has neuropathy, as you stated, it is from the diabetes. Research has proven that people who suffer from diabetes need to keep their blood sugar levels as close to normal as much as possible, at all times, to help lower incidents of further complications and possibly help with the ones they had developed. Diet, exercise, and medication help keep the blood sugar levels within normal range. You stated she is inactive due to pain in her legs. She can exercise her upper body by swinging her arms around and over her head, move her torso back and forth, and bend over, hands touching the knees or feet. I suggest she see a dietitian to help her with diet. There are new approaches to controlling diet with diabetes now.Thank you for your question.",

            "answer": "Thanks for answering.\u00a0\u00a0My friend has gone to see a diatician and keeps her blood sugar levels within the normal range but the neuropathy pain continues to increase.\u00a0\u00a0I am so concerned for her and have suggested she diet to keep the weight off since she's not able to walk or do normal exercises.\u00a0\u00a0On top of the pain, she is now losing her sight from the results of the diabetes and is having lazer surgery.\u00a0\u00a0She takes Neurontin for the pain.\u00a0\u00a0Now you can see why I'm concerned to see a fairly healthy functioning individual become so disabled and inactive with pain.I fell and damaged my breacheal plexus (sp) and have some neuropathy in my right arm so I can understand the pain she is having in her feet and legs.\u00a0\u00a0I have suggested accupuncture to her but she is so down from her pain that she feels nothing will help her.It's just so sad to watch loved ones suffer and it was so sudden.\u00a0\u00a0Clydene",

            "answer": "Clydene,My sister is a Type 2 diabetic & has peripheral neuropathy pain & she takes\u00a0\u00a0Supplemental Alpha-Lipoic Acid 1200 mg/ day.She says if she runs out of it she can tell within a week\u00a0\u00a0because the pain returns.\u00a0\u00a0I've looked up some info regarding theAlpha-Lipoic Acid\u00a0\u00a0,info is from Oregon State University, for you to read yourself....It's got lots of info so here's the spot yourlooking for... http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/infocenter/othernuts/la/#dmneuropDiabetes Mellitus & Diabetic Neuropathy. They are quite aways down on the page. A short-term study of 24 patients withtype 2 DM found that the symptoms of peripheral neuropathy were improved in those who took 1800 mg/day of oral racemicLA for 3 weeks compared to those who took a placebo.Motor and sensory deficits were also somewhat improved at the end of 6 months of oral LA therapy, but the trend did notreach statistical significance. In the longest controlled trial of oral LA therapy, 299 patients with diabetic peripheralneuropathy were randomly assigned to treatment with 1200 mg/day of racemic LA, 600 mg/day of racemic LA or a placebo.However, after 2 years of treatment, only 65 of the original participants were included in the final analysis. In that subgroup,those who took either 1200 mg/day or 600 mg/day of LA showed significant improvement in electrophysiological tests ofnerve conduction compared to those who took the placebo.It helped my sister alot faster than this study & states.\u00a0\u00a0She orders hers off the internet.that's the best price she could find.I have seen it at Walmart though in the vitamin section.God Bless You & Merry Christmas,TJ",
