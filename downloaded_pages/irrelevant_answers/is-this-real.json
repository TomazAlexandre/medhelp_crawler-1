    "question": "I guess I can't really believe this as so much has gone wrong the past three years, but I feel that this diagnosis is some how wrong I don't feel my legs tingling and the desire to move them just the opposite they feel like lead balloons that are heavy, I have sharp pains in the right leg that does not go away when awake. they did a sleep study and it showed leg movements around 54% of the time with it wake me up 19 to 25 times a hour. so the doctor gave me a prescription to take that could cause daytime sleepiness, I already take several blood pressure and heart meds that do that, is there a way to treat this if it is true RLS without meds. I do suffer from anemia and recieve iron infusion every 4 to 5 months.",
