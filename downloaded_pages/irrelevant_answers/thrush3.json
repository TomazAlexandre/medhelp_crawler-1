            "answer": "That sounds awful to cope with for so long! Does your doctor always do cultures when you have the infections? I'm wondering if it's really always thrush or perhaps you get other common infections (such as bacterial vaginosis, as suggested in the other reply) too, which then lead to more thrush or urinary tract infections.Those can be passed back and forth between sexual partners, which is worth discussing with your doctor if you're sexually active.Also, recurrent thrush infections can be a symptom of other illnesses, like diabetes or HIV. I don't mean to scare you with the HIV suggestion; it's just one health problem with thrush as a common symptom, and easily ruled out if you have an HIV test. Perhaps your doctor would consider running some tests to look for an underlying cause. If the doctor won't do that, I'd consider getting a second opinion from a doctor who's willing to further explore these problems. Two years of all that is way too long! It must be nearly driving you insane to be in such discomfort.",
