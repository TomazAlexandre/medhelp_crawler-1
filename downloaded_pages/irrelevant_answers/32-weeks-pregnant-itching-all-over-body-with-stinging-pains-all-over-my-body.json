            "answer": "I had a similar issue. My OB rx'd atarax (i think thats how its spelled) its basically an antihistimine. They will avoid narcotic pain relievers because the baby can get addicted. Some docs RX ambien for pregnant women after 5 months. Be up front with your doc in how this situation is affecting you.
