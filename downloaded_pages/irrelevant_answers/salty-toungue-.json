            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!This could be an abnormal perception of taste. Dry tongue can also give a salty taste. Presence of blood as in mouth ulcers, vitamin C deficiency, bleeding gums, pus in gums, and gastric reflux can cause a salty taste in mouth. Please consider a dental checkup.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks for the fast response. My doctor told me to take Prilosec OTC. I just am worried it may be my pituitary tumor. When I got checked for it, my Dr said it wasnt producing any hormones or anything. Could that be why I'm tasting salt? I do have extremely bad GERD ever since I was 1, I had tubes all over my face, it was bad. Could it be my tumor? or because I suddenly stoped the synthroid?",

            "answer": "HiStopping Synthyroid or the Pituitary tumor should not cause salty taste. However you can ask the specialist you see also.You can follow some lifestyle changes: Avoid heavy meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bet at least 2 hours after food. Maybe these tips will help you.Also if you have had severe GERD then just one drug may not help you. You may need a combination of acid reducing drugs.Ideally you should go for upper GI endoscopy. Please discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",

I have GERD, and a number of medical problems.Pituitary tumor, although it is tiny.Aortic StenosisAsthmaDepressionUnder active Thyroidand a few more things.I'm on medicine for all of them. Except the tumor, obviously.I am a hypochondriac, and I do worry about everything lolWhat could this be? I just had blood tests a few months ago, and It said I do not have diabetes.Any answer would help. I am going to the DR Monday, but its driving me nuts!When I went, my endocrinologist said my tumor wasnt making any hormones or anything either. How could it just start to make them?Could me not being on synthroid all of a sudden make this?",
