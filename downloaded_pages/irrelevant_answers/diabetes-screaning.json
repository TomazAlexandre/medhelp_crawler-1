They haven't called so I'm assuming its ok. If u do have it, doesn't mean you will after pregnancy. I'm sure it happens a lot so remember the drs will guide you. Sorry I can't help but I wish you well.",

            "answer": "Its always scary when you have to go through something \"different\" but what seems different to you is somewhat common for drs. Once they educate you on this issue you will feel more confident about it. And of course you're worried! You're going to be a mom! Everything worries a mom when its about your baby! You will be fine! Good luck.",
