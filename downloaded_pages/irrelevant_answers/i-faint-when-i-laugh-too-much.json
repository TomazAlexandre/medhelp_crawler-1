            "answer": "Jean-I do not know whether or not your stroke could be affecting your current symptom. However, your post caught my eye because I was recently diagnosed with Narcolepsy with Cataplexy. Often in people who have this disorder, they experience loss of muscle tone which presents similarly to fainting after experiencing emotion (anger, excitement, surprise, laughter). In my case, I thought I was having fainting spells, but was actually experiencing Cataplexy, which is when your body actually abruptly enters a REM sleep cycle. Since we are paralyzed while we are in REM sleep cycles, it results in a sudden loss of muscle tone or fainting. I would recommend researching the disorder on your own or speaking to your doctor about it. Although there are no cures for the disorder, there are prescription medications that can help treat the symptoms.",
