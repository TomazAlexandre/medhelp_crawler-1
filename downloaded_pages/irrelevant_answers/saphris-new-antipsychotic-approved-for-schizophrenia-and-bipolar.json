            "answer": "How would this work as opposed to seroquel, and if you found that you were more stable at dosing more frequently than you have ever been in your life....what would make you want to switch? Benifits,......less long term damage? Would this also address anxiety or would you still need a drug for that?",

            "answer": "Only a psychiatrist would suggest specific medication changes. Its just a new option for people as regards antipsychotics. Abilify works in a manner somewhat different from the other antipsychotics and Saphris was based on Abilify (Serotonin-Dopamine agonists) so it should have a similar side effect profile of having less sedation and less of a potential for weight gain and diabetes (though all current antipsychotics can cause this). If you want to know the full side effect profile as well as beneficial results go to the medication website. Generally antipsychotics are not used as anti-anxiety medications though they can have somewhat of this effect. Like all new medications that have just been approved their use has only been in clinical studies so psychiatrists will learn about them in working practice as they are put into use. Sometimes there are Phase IV studies to determine further results of medications after they are put into use. As with any new medication they'll learn more as its used. The side effect profile should be similar to Abilify from what I know but each person reacts differently to each medication. You could ask your psychiatrist more about it as it is FDA approved so they should be familiar with it as its put into use.",

            "answer": "I am also on Seroquel and it works really well for me, aside from a massive weight gain and being groggy.\u00a0\u00a0I have found so far that the new antisychotics add on to my exsisting anxiety, and causes me to have very severe symptoms.I too am pleased with the Seroquel, but I would like to see if Abilify helps, I just dont want to go through the terrible reaction I have had with the new meds.Are there any that do not make you anxious or gain weight - this is the question I am searching an answer for.....I guess its all trial and error?",

            "answer": "Weight gain and the potential of diabetes is a potential for all currently available antipsychotics. Abilify has the least potential to cause this. Abilify and Geodon are activating and can make some people feel anxious. As for Fanapt and Saphris they are newly released and are clinically similar to Abilify but that doesn't mean they will have the exact same profile. If someone hasn't responded to or has difficulties with the antipsychotics they've tried those are two new options they could ask their psychiatrist about.",

    "question": "This is a new antipsychotic Saphris that was FDA approved recently.http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm177401.htmThis is of interest because its a new option but its still works in the same manner as current antipsychotics so the \"next generation\" ones I have spoken about are years off but if any advance in clinical studies I'll update people. I believe right now this one should be available and as always people's response rates to different antipsychotics varies so this would be yet another option if people have not responded to what is available now that you could speak to your psychiatrist about it. It is FDA approved for both schizophrenia and bipolar.",
