            "answer": "i don't think you are overeacting, you obviously have some symptoms that are making you sick. you might be hypoglycemic which eventually might turn into diabetes. are you following a lactose free diet now? you need to see a doctor. what is it that you usually eat? is there another med that you can take that would not make you gain wait. sometimes symptoms can misguide you. i was sick for about 11 months, doctor kept telling me it was just allergies. finally a went to see a gastroenterologist to discover that i have celiac disease (allergy to gluten which is in wheat, barley etc).",

    "question": "Hello,I am posting this question because i need any answers or thoughts regarding my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to think any more.\u00a0\u00a0I may just be over reacting.\u00a0\u00a0I have posted before, but have not received any replies.\u00a0\u00a0This morning I got out of bed, got dizzy, blacked out, and hit my head on the windowsill. I am tired, and constantly out of breath (not asthma). Quite a bit, I become hypoglycemic and get shaky, and I have to have sugar. Other times my sugar is in the diabetes range for fasting (high 120s).\u00a0\u00a0My body is out of control.\u00a0\u00a0I just found out I am lactose intolerant.\u00a0\u00a0I also have always had large amounts of protein in my urine (300mg), and traces of ketones. (I don\u2019t like meat or peanut butter- protein, and I am always eating- unexplained ketones.)\u00a0\u00a0I am also on a med that causes weight gain, so I have not lost any weight.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your time, and any help would be greatly appreciated.",
