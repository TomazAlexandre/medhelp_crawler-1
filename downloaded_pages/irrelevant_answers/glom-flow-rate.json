            "answer": "Okay...so I basically understand the correlation between creatinine and eGFR and kidney function, and it's starting to concern me, when I put 2 & 2 together. I had blood work done recently, because my doctor is trying to diagnose the cause of some female issues. The metabolic panel portion of my lab results showed a serum creatinine of 1.06 (high) and eGFR of 58 (low). I am 39 yoa & caucasian, by the way (that apparently makes a difference on the levels.). I have had some of the symptoms of renal disease (fatigue, achiness, edema in ankles), but, since I am having other health concerns, I attributed them to that. For instance, I have a severe injury to my lymphatic system from a fasciotomy on my left leg, so I attributed the edema to that, although I'd noticed some light edema in my right leg, lately. I just figured I need to take some weight off, and the edema would go away. Kidney issues never entered my mind.The crazy thing is that my blood pressure is always really, really good. My cholesterol is just now inching a little above \"normal\" (total: 220, HDL: 52, LDL: 142, VLDL: 34), after being normal for years, despite being clinically obese. I have no signs of imminent diabetes, though it and heart disease do run in the family. I am currently attempting to get the weight off, so I can cut these risks down.With a grandmother with diabetes and some loss of kidney function, in addition to the other family health issues and the weight issue, I really feel this Creatinine/eGFR result could stand to be looked at more closely, but neither my gynecologist nor my endocrinologist even mentioned the results. Should I be concerned, if they aren't?",

I have not heard from my Doc.\u00a0\u00a0Should I contact him?\u00a0\u00a0 I have never heard of a Glom flow rate.\u00a0\u00a0Everything I have read talks about kidney disease.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something I need to be concernd about???",
