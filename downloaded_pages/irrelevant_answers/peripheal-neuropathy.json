            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. There are several causes for peripheral neuropathies including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Vitamin B12 deficiency too should be looked into. Multiple sclerosis is another possibility but less likely in your case.\u00a0\u00a0Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your reply! I'm not diabetic.Lab tests have always come back saying my thyroid is ok,but since it was the T3-T4 test only,and my mother had and siblings have thyroid problems,I think it should be looked into.I do have bladder problems...hoping that it hasn't gone on to involve my kidneys!",

    "question": "Can someone please help me understand the causes of PN? I had a EMG in June and my neurologist said I had neuropathy.It really hadn't bothered me too much until last night.It started with my left ankle itching.During the night it felt as if the neuropathy was traveling into my legs.Tonight my right ankle is itching.Guess it'll probably be a repeat of last night---groan! I've been severely fatigued the last few days;as if my body was a mass of jello!",
