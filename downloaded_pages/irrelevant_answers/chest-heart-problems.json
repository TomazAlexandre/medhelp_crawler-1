            "answer": "Hi\u00a0\u00a0there, I am sorry that you guys have no insurance, that has got to rot. It sound like your mom has a few things going on hey? I am not in the medical field, but to me to it doesn't sound like heart. it sound like it could be diabetes or I am not sure. usually for pain to be associated with heart it is on the left, but once in a while it could start on the right. the little red bumps could be excema (not sure I spelled it right) aches could be arthiritis and memory could be many things from just aging, (I personally know that my memory is slipping to due to much going on and stress.)I would call a doctor and tell them you have no insurance. maybe they will work with you on this. I know that if we were to go to the clicinc at the hospital, they will wave your fee. we have\u00a0\u00a0aplace in our town that if you are under insured or have no insureance they will see you for FREE. see if you have one of those places nearby.good luck and I hope it isn't anything too seroiusMichelle",
