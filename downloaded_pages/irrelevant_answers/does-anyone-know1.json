The measurement is just a rough guide to the growth of the baby and it can be off by a week or two. So many things effect the measurement such as how the baby is lying, placenta size, amount of amniotic fluid and size of baby. The size of the baby can vary from a usual 6-10lbs which is a huge difference! Babies also have growth spurts. This is why they give you a due date from an early scan as it is much more accurate.",
