            "answer": "Yes, my first pregnancy I was diagnosed with\u00a0\u00a0pre-eclampsia at 36 weeks and a few days. Got hospitalised to be monitored and bp just went so high they had to take me down to labour room at 36 weeks and 6 days. Thankfully I was 37 weeks the next morning so they induced me. However, the baby was in distress and his heart beat was going lower and lower so I had to have an emergency c-section. Thankfully I had him at full-term so he was a healthy but tiny baby. He is now 5 years old :)",

            "answer": "I was in my 36th week when I was diagnosed with pre eclampsia. I was monitored and put on bed rest. Scheduled for induction at 38 weeks. My delivery did end in an emergency c section because of my blood pressure and a seizure from the high blood pressure, the seizure was very small and quick and caused no ill effects to me or baby but after that they said nope you are at risk and we are doing the c section!! It was worth it in the end because I could have died. That was with my first pregnancy and I have had two full term pregnancies since with no pre eclampsia and am hoping for the same with this one. I was told because the father of my first was different than the father of my others I was less likely to get it again, I guess it is something to do with the father??? I guess getting divorced and finding a better man was good for my blood pressure lol",

            "answer": "I'm kind of worried about having to have a c-section. After doing some reading I'm pretty sure it's pre-eclampasia. I'm glad to hear that you ladies and your babies ended up just fine. That helps me feel better.So when do you need to go in to the hospital? My swelling is increasing and I'm having off and on headaches. I wanna try to complete this 24 hr urine sample so I don't have to redo it... But idk I'm still kinda freaked out.",

My doctor didn't check it out right away even though I told him something was definitely wrong. He finally caught it right before I hit 38 weeks. I was induced within 24 hours after that",

    "question": "Has anyone ever gotten pre-eclampasia after 36 weeks? I'm 37+5 and I might have it. I went in to see my ob because my swelling got drastically worse within the past few days. My bp was high even after laying down in the room for 30 minutes. Now I have to do a 24 hour urine catch and blood work. I'm really nervous. Has anyone had this happen to them so close to their due date? What happened if you did?",
