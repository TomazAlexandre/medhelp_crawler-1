            "answer": "I had to take the test twice and I'm not saying your doc is like this but I noticed that every test I had to take I had to take twice cause \"something was off\" etc. It was just weird and once my doctor told me I had to take that test again because \"my levels seemed a little over\" so I switched docs and it turned out my levels were fine. Idk if my doc was trying to make my insurance pay more or whatever but she was having me worry over nothing continuously throughout my pregnancy when it turned out I didn't even need the tests done.",
