            "answer": "Yes, thyroid could cause those symptoms, but without testing for Free T3 and Free T4, we can't really tell you anything.Fasting blood glucose would be a separate issue, but diabetes can also cause some of those symptoms.Have you been tested for thyroid antibodies, to determine whether or not you have an autoimmune thyroid condition?\u00a0\u00a0It's not unusual for symptoms to show up, long before blood tests indicate an issue and since your doctor is testing only TSH, it could be a while.You may have to think about finding a different doctor, who will be willing to test adequately, to determine the cause of your symptoms.Best way to get them to research and be your own advocate. Don't give up; some of us have had to go through several doctors before we found one willing to help.",

            "answer": "You can still request these tests from your doctor and tell him that they are for your purpose, as i did. Your insurance co. is paying for these tests, not the doctor. And, I agree with Barb as far as finding another doctor, but, after these tests are complete. yes, thyroid issues can cause a host of other issues including a higher glucose level. I experience that as well. The key here, is to get a diagnosis and educate yourself about thyroid issues and finally, take one day at a time.",

You may have to find a different doctor, who will be willing to go out on a limb for you.",

            "answer": "Your pancreas puts out insulin to regulate your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0If the pancreas isn't working properly, your blood sugar will be out of whack.......\u00a0\u00a0thyroid puts out thyroid hormones, that have different functions.While both thyroid issues and type I diabetes (don't know your age, but type II diabetes is not autoimmune) are endocrine issues, thyroid levels don't really raise your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Increase in blood sugar means that either your pancreas is not producing enough insulin to metabolize your sugar intake, or your body is resistant to the insulin (insulin resistance).You might want to visit the endo regarding the blood sugar issue, but stick with the doctor who cared and might willing to stick his neck out and do additional tests for your thyroid.I find it amazing that some of the best studies that show TSH is not the \"end all, be all\" of thyroid, and that FT3 and FT4 are more important, come from UK, yet UK is the most unyielding, when it comes to testing/treatment, simply because of the NHS guidelines.\u00a0\u00a0 I can't help wonder if we, here in the U.S. will have the same issues when our health care plan takes full effect.",

I looked up and seen that thyroid probs can raise your blood sugar levels slightly and mine is very slightly, its very depressing and very tiring trying to get the help that's needed most of the docs I've seen has just shrugged me of as having just panic attacks and depression, I've had e.n.t appointments plus heart tests to rule out things and I'm never close to what it can be all I know is that a lot of the issues always comes back to thyroid and I have a nodule which to me makes sense, I've been told if tsh is normal then they generally won't do any other tests so I can't see how I'm possibly going to find anyway through this, if my nodule has grown then they have been talking about removing half my thyroid but I have also read up there are meds 2 try and reduce it before even contemplating a operation, do these people really have any conversation or imput on reality and what we have to deal with I ask myself lol, I did feel about giving up and hoping that eventually (hopefully sooner rather than later) my tsh level maybe changing but on a serious level I just don't wanna sit back and wait for things 2 happen I just want to be taken seriously.",
