    "question": "Sooo went to the ob today and got the results for my glucola. Normal is between 60 and 130 and mine was 790. So next week on Tuesday I have to fast after midnight go in at seven drink the stuff again then they will draw my blood at 8 9 and 10 and we'll have to see how it goes but I am high risk for it so I'm kind of freaked out. Anyone had any experience with this? On the plus side the same day they are letting me take another stab at confirming the gender so yay silver lining",
