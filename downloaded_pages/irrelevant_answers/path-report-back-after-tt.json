    "question": "Hello all,\u00a0\u00a0just received the path report and good and bad news.Lets start off with the bad news.Instead of 1 nodule(original was left side) they found a second on the right side and the same type of cancer.\u00a0\u00a0Papillary.OK, the good news:Left side was a whopping 0.8 CM and the right side they found was a whole 0.2 cm.\u00a0\u00a0I was shocked to find out about the right side and am glade the surgeon decided to remove the entire thyroid once he found out the left side was cancerous.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't know of the right side until he received the path report.\u00a0\u00a0Also good was that all surgical margins were free of the tumor so it stayed where it was at and did not spread.So now I wait until I see my endo to tell me what is next.I was started on 100mg synthroid and have not felt any problems since the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0SO I think I am running pretty normal because I feel the same as I did before the surgery just a little winded due to the surgery if I do too much since it was only 1 week ago.Question, when someone gets a TT done what are the chances of getting diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0I have not heard or read anything about this as will ask my endo once I see him.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something normal?\u00a0\u00a0I am only 38 and male and hope this does not happen!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Is there any literature about this?Thanks everyone out there!Scott",
