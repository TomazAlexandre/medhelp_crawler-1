            "answer": "Not a doctor, but a nurse here. And, I have the same symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0She should rule out neurological causes- such as Multiple Sclerosis or Myasthenia Gravis. Unfortunately, MS requires an MRI which can cost a lot of money.\u00a0\u00a0If these are ruled out, you will maybe want to check into endocrinology or rheuomatology... it could be a hormone thing, or possible something like fibromyalgia or even lupus.\u00a0\u00a0Or, it could be stress/anxiety or somatization (But, having these symptoms myself, I know how maddening it is to have people assume it's psychological off the bat).Good luck!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine her I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that she needs, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about her health concern.Burning sensation, numbness or tingling sensation in any part of body is considered nerve related in origin. This burning sensation she is having can occur due to impingement, irritation or compression of nerve at back or part of body itself. Additionally, blurred vision can be due to any neurological disorder or any eye pathology. Therefore, I would recommend that she consults a neurologist for thorough examination. Hope this helps.",
