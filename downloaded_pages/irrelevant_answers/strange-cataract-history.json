            "answer": "If you don't have diabetes and a rare cornea condition K-conus then its likely that ll the changes in your glasses of increasing myopia (actually called pseudomyopia since not due to eye getting longer) is due to the cataract.If possible I suggest you get a second opinion by a cataract/IOL surgeon outside your present system. Also emphasize that you are bother by blurred vision and what ever that causes (trouble reading, driving at night, recognizing faces, televsion, etc).Likely\u00a0\u00a0you are at the stage you need cataract/IOL surgery.JCH MD",

            "answer": "Some of your care was given by non-MD, non-physician, limited training optometrists. They often lack the training to make many medical diagnosis (just like comparing the nurse with a MD).The EYe MD will not need your old records or glasses. The IOL is chosen using a computer formula based on cornea shape, length of eye, type of IOL and sometime depth of anterior chamber.JCH MD",

    "question": "I actually have a very strange history of cataract development.\u00a0\u00a0Up to about 2004 I have been moderately myopic, somewhere between -4.75 and -7, I don't remember which for sure but it could have been close to the first one.\u00a0\u00a0My eyes started changing very suddenly such that my examining doctor recommended I get a diabetes exam.\u00a0\u00a0As I figured, I had no diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I had to change glasses about every three or four months -- no exaggeration, and even one of my prescriptions had to be redone because I was one month late picking up my glasses.Here is the strangest part:\u00a0\u00a0Through most of those three years or so when the rapid changes were recurring, no matter how bothersome my cataracts -- the doctors kept telling me it was \"beginning cataracts\".\u00a0\u00a0I kept feeling they were lying to me so as to postpone any surgery.I waited quite awhile to get the glasses I currently have -- which are now -10.50.\u00a0\u00a0EVEN STILL -- the optometrist who tested me for these glasses -- when I stated they did not fully correct my vision -- he retorted my eyes were \"one in a million\" -- BUT he barely acknowledged I had any significant cataracts!\u00a0\u00a0I even asked how bad these were and he showed me a model eye with a few light streaks around the edges saying, \"they are only like about that.\"\u00a0\u00a0How in the world does he figure my cataracts were not significant given my eyes may have changed at least up to half a dozen diopters between the onset of cataracts and my getting those glasses?Given this history, do I face a kind of surgery wherein the doctors are somewhat clueless as to my premorbid vision -- why is this, and is it essential I get my former eye records from the HMO I used to go to in order to affirm my premorbid vision before cataracts?Snsli",
