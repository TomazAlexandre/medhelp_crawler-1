            "answer": "Hello,From the pattern of baldness it looks like male pattern baldness. Androgenic alopecia is a common form of hair loss and typically occurs in M shaped pattern.Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait. Other causes may be use of some drugs, infections and underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. A biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope) of your scalp may be needed to establish the correct diagnosis.Depending on your type of hair loss, treatments are available. If a medicine is causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine and if it is due to infections or systemic disease,then treating it will treat baldness.Medicines which are useful are minoxidil and finasteride. Finally one can resort to hair transplantation also. Hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
