However if you have diabetes, before entering into the, military it can disqualify you from entering the armed forces.\u00a0\u00a0 I would suggest you contact someone on base in the JAG - Judge Advocate Generals office to help you.\u00a0\u00a0(My dad was in the military).\u00a0\u00a0They will be better able to help advise you before the board.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on what your Job is you might get medically discharged, but they can help advise you better and help get you the services you need and to keep your\u00a0\u00a0veteran benefits.I am sorry that I could not help give you more insight to what will happen.\u00a0\u00a0I hope all goes well for you.

Of course he is off the flight line and he is working with the doctor and nutritionist, but we understand, as you describe this can lead to a medical discharge if he's type I insulin dependent.\u00a0\u00a0So, I would like to be prepared if this goes that direction and how to make sure he gets all the benefits available.",
