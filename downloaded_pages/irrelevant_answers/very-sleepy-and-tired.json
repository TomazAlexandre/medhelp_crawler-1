            "answer": "I just second the above recommendation. These seem to be symptoms of blood sugar that is out of control and needs your and a Drs attention. It might be that you could control this with diet but letting it go will only give the Diabetes more time to do damage to other organs--- and you don't want that. I\u00a0\u00a0first started out on med which did bring mine down and then as i read and learned more , I realized that diet & exercise play a BIG part in controllingdiabetes ( at least Type 2 ) so i went after it on both fronts.\u00a0\u00a0I am now off all meds but do have to monitor my levels daily. The optimal number is 88 and always under 120 tho each persons situation may vary in how they respond to the meds,and other attempts to keep the numbers down. If you are Diabetic and do not deal with it now, you will regret it down the road.Good Luck,PJ",
