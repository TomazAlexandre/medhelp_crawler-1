Some heavier people have it under their breasest, in their fat folds or in their armpits.Wash twice a day with a gentle soap, use Lotrimin (I find it is EXTREMELY effective) once in the morning and once at night after cleansing. Make sure the area stays DRY.\u00a0\u00a0You can use powder to help with the chafing and sweating.\u00a0\u00a0And stay away from really tight clothes.\u00a0\u00a0Be religious about it for 2 weeks.... And it will clear up.If it doesn't start feeling better within 24 hours, or it gets worse, talk to your doctor. You may have a fungal infection that is being followed up by a bacterial infection. (Look up jock it and/or intertrigo on emedecine).",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The first thing to do is rule out diabetes. You are probably talking about Hidradenitis suppurativa, which presents as recurrent boil-like pus-like discharge abscesses resulting in difficult-to-heal open wounds and scarring. It commonly occurs on apocrine sweat gland-bearing skin such as in the groin, the underarms and under the breasts. It is also known as \u2018acne inversa\u2019. The disease can spread to genitals. It can also be due to staphylococcal skin infections. Wash skin with antiseptic lotions daily to decrease bacteria. Treatment is by topical antibiotics and steroids. Local antibiotics of erythromycin and Clindamycin group also help. Retenoid group of drugs also help. Wear loose fitting clothes. Get your diabetes status checked as high blood sugar can also cause recurrent boils. Consult a skin specialist please. Take care!",
