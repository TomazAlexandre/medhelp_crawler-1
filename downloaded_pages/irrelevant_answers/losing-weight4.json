            "answer": "First of all, you might get more responses if you posted on Type II forum, as this is Type I. Also there isn't a lot of traffic here in general, so I suggest you go on to a board with a lot of people who are considering these issues and you will get a lot more info. Two good ones are: TuDiabetes.com and Diabetesforums.comJust to give you some general feedback, you don't mention what your medication regimen is or if you take insulin. Weight loss is hard for Type II's because of insulin resistance. If you take insulin you may be \"feeding the insulin\" by matching your insulin to the food rather than the reverse. Best is to use an Insulin: Carb ratio and to carb count. If you are not on insulin you might want to meet with a diabetic educator who can help you figure out how to change your eating. But I personally think you would learn a lot more on the two boards listed above.",
