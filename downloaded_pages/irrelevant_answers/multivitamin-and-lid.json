            "answer": "After being hypothyroid for 8 years and trying everything under the sun, this past summer I came across Mannatech.com which have suppliments specifically for endocrine diseases (thyroid disease and diabetes). I decided to give a couple of their items a try. I now religiously use their 'Plus' which is an herbal-amino acid combination, Ambrotose, which is expensive, but comes in powder form, in a large container and after 6 months, I still have 2/3rds left. Oh, there's probably the BEST product, GlycoLEAN/Catalyst, which is a mulitvitamin and mineral suppliment. That, along with the other two (I think this one is the best) has given me a lot of energy and has helped me to lose weight. I have a friend who takes these same ones I've mentioned. She was lethargic, heavy and repeated herself constantly because her memory was shot, due to this disease,\u00a0\u00a0and now she looks and feels great.If you decide to give these a try,\u00a0\u00a0please let me know how they work for you.",

Just thought someone could save me the time of reading a million labels and give me a brand name I can go for. Thanks.",
