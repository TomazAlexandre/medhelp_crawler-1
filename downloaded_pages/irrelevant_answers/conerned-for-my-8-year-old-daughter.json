            "answer": "Drinking a lot of water is a symptom\u00a0\u00a0of diabetes. I would take her to the doctor to be safe.That being said, my 6 year old had bad breath for 6 weeks straight. after 2 weeks I took her to the dentist to rule out anything dental.\u00a0\u00a0He did and said wait 2 more weeks before taking her to the doc.\u00a0\u00a0I waited and her breath was still bad.\u00a0\u00a0So I took her. Her diabetes test was normal, and her urine was normal, but it was cloudy with a lot of particles in it.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor decided to send it out for an amino acid test.\u00a0\u00a0Well sure enough there were amino acids in her urine.\u00a0\u00a0She did a re-check and there was a different amino acid in her urine.\u00a0\u00a0She said it probably wasn't an amino acid problem since they were two different amino acids, also those usually show up in infancy and have very distinct symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0They did a blood test to be sure and it was fine. Then another urine had no amino acids.\u00a0\u00a0She told me most likely the filter at the bottom of my daughters kidney doesn't always function properly.\u00a0\u00a0Right now it is not a concern, but may be some day.",

    "question": "I have recently read questions about people having moth ball breath.\u00a0\u00a0I am very concerned, my 8 year old daughter has this.\u00a0\u00a0I have really noticed it more over the last 3 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0It is all day, everyday and does not respond to tooth/tongue brushing or mouthwash.Can this be a sign of diabetes or a vitamin deficiency?\u00a0\u00a0I also read that it could be a kidney functioning issue or a GI issue.\u00a0\u00a0Please advise your thoughts on someone this young with this issue.\u00a0\u00a0She has no other symptoms other than drinking a lot of water.",
