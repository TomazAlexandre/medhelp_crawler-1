            "answer": "Hi,I don\u2019t think it\u2019s due to a pinching of the nerve. Usually, when a nerve is pinched, it involves only one of the legs and not both of them simultaneously. Firstly, a blood sugar must be done to rule out diabetes mellitus as it can present with similar symptoms. An EMG (electromyogram) should also be done to rule out a muscle disease although a burning and tingling sensation as described by you increases the possibility of a neurological disease.I sincerely feel that you should get yourself examined by a neurologist as a good neurological examination is a must before you proceed further.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted.Kind Regards.",

    "question": "Firstly, I feel as though I have a pain in the right side of my hip/ pelvic area for a year now. I got an x ray done and had an abdominal cat scan done for that pain. Nothing showed up though and I still have that pain. Now very recently (this past week) I have experianced both legs slightly burning, soreness through out both of them, slight tingling, and not to mention fasiculations. This does not really bring down at all through out the day but it does get me really worrying that something could be wrong. I was wondering if the pelvic pain was correlated and it is possibly a pinched nerve? Or a defficiancy? Im just confused because I am a 22 year old male that is in decent shape.Thanks",
