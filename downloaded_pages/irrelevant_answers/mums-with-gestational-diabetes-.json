            "answer": "I just found out about me having GD about 2 weeks ago and I actually got very upset with my doctor because he wanted to put me straight on meds and insuline ,I refused his reco .I think pregnant women glucose is higher anyways because you are carrying another person in you and your body is going through so much .Anyways I have gotten a monitor and I have to poke myself 4 times a day ,before my breakfast and then every 2 hrs after my main meals to be honest I have kept quite a good record and kept my sugar under sometimes and its all by changing a bit what I aet and no treats .

Oh well, not long now. Good luck to you all. X",

    "question": "Just wanted to ask all mums with gestational diabetes, when you\u00a0\u00a0check your glucose levels with a\u00a0\u00a0monitor how long after a meal are you required to do so? What's the maximum mmol you should be or aim for? Just curious, coz here in the UK they expect us to achieve a job max of 7.5mmol an HOUR after a meal! It's very difficult....",
