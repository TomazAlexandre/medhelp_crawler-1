    "question": "I've had diabetes since I was 10. I am now 20. This past year I think I've had the most problems with my pump. I use the paradigm. I've been getting motor errors as well as NO Delivery. But in the past week I have had DKA probably 4 times, but not bad enough to go to the hospital . My sites have been bending so that I don't receive the insulin. I use the 6mm. I am not one to talk about my diabetes but lately I can not handle it anyone else having these problems or had them in the past? Or know a better pump? I've called Medtronic\u00a0\u00a0but they were\u00a0\u00a0no help.",
