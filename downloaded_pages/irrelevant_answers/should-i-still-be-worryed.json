            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.If the EKG and stress tests are normal, it's unlikely that the pain is due to a cardiac cause. Inadequate oxygenation can produce symptoms of breathlessness, as the body tries in an effort to compensate for the decreased oxygen supply. The light headedness may happen if there is inadequate supply of oxygen to the brain. This can happen with cardiac disorders or lung disorders. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0So please discuss this with your primary care physician who may ask for blood tests and an X ray chest. Lung function tests could further help in evaluation.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.It could be Asthma. Cough, chest tightness and breathlessness the three symptoms are the triad of symptoms for Asthma. It is a disease affecting the lungs causing narrowing of the airways, usually due to an allergic reaction to triggering factors. Therapy is with bronchodilators which cause the airways to dilate. Have yourself evaluated for the same. This can be detected by a spirometry test.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
