            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear about your father. If he is retaining fluid then apart from heart function, kidney and liver function should be assessed. His blood sodium and albumin level too should be assessed. The prognosis worsens in presence of any other underlying problem\u00a0\u00a0like diabetes and presence of kidney dysfunction. If the EF decreases further with time, it indicates a bad prognosis. If this value improves with time, it indicates a good prognosis. Hence this will have to be monitored from time to time. Discuss with the doctor about an adjustment in the medication your father is taking. This will reduce fluid retention and improve the cardiac output. Often a dose adjustment or addition of an additional beta blocker helps. However only your father\u2019s treating cardiologist can tell whether this can be done or not. Hope this helps.",
