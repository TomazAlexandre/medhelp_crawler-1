    "question": "No real question - just need to vent/share.\u00a0\u00a0I you remember, my 10 year old dachshund, Sienna, had 7 tumors removed a few weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0All were benign.\u00a0\u00a0About a week ago I noticed another lump - about 1\"x2\" in her chest area.\u00a0\u00a0It was very near an incision (for one of the lipomas) that I was checking to make sure all the stitches were intact after she played with the puppy.\u00a0\u00a0I took her to the vet's today to have the stitches removed and mentioned the new lump to the vet.He came out and apologized.\u00a0\u00a0He said they did a very *thorough* search for tumors and it wasn't there then (and he would have seen it - it was right next to a lipoma and they looked all over that area).Then he said the biopsy (needle) was completely mast cells.\u00a0\u00a0She goes back in for surgery tomorrow.We don't know how far it may have spread but it popped up very, very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0She has also lost 2lbs in a week.\u00a0\u00a0She needs to lose some weight but not from cancer.\u00a0\u00a0:-(I'll be speaking in depth with the vet tomorrow when we find out just what we are looking at.\u00a0\u00a0She is still very spunky but I know she couldn't handle chemo.It hasn't even been two months since we lost Buster to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I know she kind of lost her will after he died but, man, oh man!(sigh)Anyway, thanks for listening.Utah",
