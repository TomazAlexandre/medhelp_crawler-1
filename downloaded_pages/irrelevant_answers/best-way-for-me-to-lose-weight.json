    "question": "I've been trying to lose weight for many years.... and always failed miserably. I don't know if it's because of a hidden health condition, a bad metabolism, etc... I just want to lose weight to look better (to finally stop the ridicule and low self-esteem) and to prevent all of the horrible disorders/diseases like hypertension and diabetes that runs in my family. I'm 6 foot 1, about 245 lbs, female, and in college so it's difficult to obtain organic and healthy things but I try. I've been an athlete my entire life (basketball), but stopped of course because of school and work.I've tried everything. Supplements I hear about on TV and from doctors, crazy diets, different workout regimens... I don't know what to do. I can't run/jog for long distances because I have severe kyphoscoliosis, two abnormal curvatures to my spine that articulate my rib cage in such an odd position it restricts breathing and lung capacity. My deep breaths are barely stronger than a normal person's regular breath. Thus, cardio is hard for me. I use to have an enlarged thyroid as well so that probably caused a lot of constant fatigue and weight gain.Please, someone, give me an idea of how to workout and how to get this weight off! Right now, I have a normal diet and weight lift 6 times a week (abs 3 times a week). What foods should I get rid of? What should I eat and drink more of? How should I work out? PLEASE HELP!P.S. I ask here because I don't have time to see a professional. Also, do you think intermittent fasting would work?",
