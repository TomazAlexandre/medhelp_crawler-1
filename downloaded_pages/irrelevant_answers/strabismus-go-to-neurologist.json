            "answer": "Hi Becky,Welcome to the boards here.\u00a0\u00a0What does the ophthalmologist think the reason for the eye turn is? (Did you see an ophthalmologist or an Optometrist?)I am glad that your MRI was nml. There are many \"health\" related items that might bring on a turned eye. (Your left eye turns in?) Is your double vision horizontal only? Is it at distance, near, or both?Diabetes and other systemic illnesses can sometimes bring on some eye issues as you describe.What kind of eye exercises are you doing?\u00a0\u00a0I assume you are patching an eye to get rid of the double vision?Are you seeing any improvement? Do you have a follow-up appt?I know it seems like I am playing 20 questions here!\u00a0\u00a0This is my \"field\" of work, so just thought I would jump in and see how you are doing!Welcome again,Michelle",

            "answer": "thanks Michelle for your input.\u00a0\u00a0I saw an Opthalmologist and an eye muscle specialist. Do some exercises, patch my left eye and at least 1 hr a day use my left eye. The strabismus is horiz and a little at an angle. Is worse for far vision.\u00a0\u00a0Sugars and other labs and exam nl. I still think is due to the severe COnjunctivitis I had a month before this started. My next appt is on Oct 5 and she will decide on prisms, then.\u00a0\u00a0My Optometrist suggests a neuro-opthalmologist, but I want to see the specialist again first as I think it is\u00a0\u00a0a little better and Can not find that specialist in Georgia.\u00a0\u00a0Becky",
