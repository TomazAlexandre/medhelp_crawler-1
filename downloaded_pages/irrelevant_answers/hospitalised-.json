            "answer": "Are they afraid of pre eclampsia or gestational diabetes?? I ended up with gestational diabetes with my daughter (she's 3 now) at 34 weeks. They caught it late and that was probably a main issue why I had such horrible morning sickness with her up to 30 + wks pregnant. I had to monitor my keytones and ended up having to due insulin shots bc even with journaling my food and eating how they wanted me to, my body was just not producing enough insulin nor breaking down sugars like it should. I'd ask questions, try not to stress (super hard I know) they will figure out how to help you. Thinking postive for you!! My baby is 3!! I disliked my pregnancy yet she was beyond worth every bit of it.",
