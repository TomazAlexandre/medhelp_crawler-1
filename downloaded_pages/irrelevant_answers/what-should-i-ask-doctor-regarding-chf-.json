            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.If the ejection fraction is below 35%, it is diagnosed as heart failure. The ejection fraction is a useful measure of left ventricular performance. The normal range is 63-77% for males and 55-75% for females. It reflects the pumping capacity of the heart.Due to cardiac failure the heart is not able to pump adequate blood to different organs in the body. In this process the kidneys too receive inadequate blood and to compensate for this start retaining sodium. When the sodium content in the blood increases it causes fluid to seep out and cause edema.\u00a0\u00a0To improve this, the heart\u2019s pumping capacity has to be improved and the excess fluid needs to be pumped out.So, you should ask your doctor what his present ejection fraction is. The pumping capacity of the heart can be increased with medications. Follow a low salt regimen diet and restrict fluids as instructed by your doctor. Also, his diabetes must be adequately controlled.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
