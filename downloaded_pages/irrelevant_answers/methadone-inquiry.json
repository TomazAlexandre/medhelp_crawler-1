            "answer": "i am 25 now and i have been an addict since i was 15...i got on methadone when i was 19. worst mistake of my life...i just got off methadone 2 months ago and was the worst withdrawl of my life. just from personal experience maybe u should try the suboxone/subutex program...i currently just got on subutex and i loved the way it worked and i didnt have to go to the methadone clinic everyday anymore, which was a big lift off my shoulder's...my doctor just switched me to suboxone though and today was the first day i took it and it is working just fine. if u decide to do the methadone program please make sure they explain to you what it does to your body and how it stays in your fat cells (which is the reason it is so hard to come off of) because when i started a doctor never told me how bad it would be to come off it...honestly i now feel methadone clinics don't give a **** about how people are doing, all they care about is how much money they can make. whatever u decide, best wishes and i hope all goes well for you.",

            "answer": "Common side effects of methadone use include the following:ConstipationDrowsinessSkin RashSweatingWater retentionFlushingChanges in sex drive or erectile dysfunctionDizziness (especially in the beginning of treatment and especially as a person in methadone maintenance treatment rises from a lying position)Dry mouthI've seen so many friends on methadone that are drowsy all the time, maybe it's the dosage, but the fact is there is a chance of these side effects. I've used all narcotics, heroin, crack, speed, etc etc and only when i became clean and sober did i inherit the freedom from \"side effects\" . I refused to go on methadone, i got sick and tired of\u00a0\u00a0relying on any drug to get by.",

            "answer": "very true....when i was on methadone i was constantly sleepy...i took naps everyday and i have a kid. the side affects of methadone are sometimes the feeling people are looking for because it gives you a slight feeling of being high at first but that goes away within a month or two..after that its all down hill. Methadone takes ahold of you and you can't stop...I WOULD NEVER recommend this program to anyone again.",

            "answer": "Mild withdrawal symptoms that you may experience during methadone maintenance treatment include the following:Anxiety or depressionFatigueInsomniaHot flashesMuscle painsNauseaRestlessnessCravings for drugsI figured to myself, why wait to go through withdrawal if i'm going to go through withdrawal from the drug i'm taking to not go through withdrawal? Pay me now or pay me later. I didn't want me to be tied to having to take a drug for the rest of my life. I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and the first thing that my doctor suggested was to take medication. That's what all doctors do, apparently. Why not suggest a drug free life, and change your nutrition? I don't know why doctors feel more comfortable suggesting we be tied to drugs, but i'm glad i found it to be a lame answer. Not only am i not on methadone now, i refused to take diabetes , blood pressure and cholesterol medication, and dealt with it by using proper diet and nutrition. I've reversed my \"disease\". So, now i'm not on methadone, and I'm not on diabetes, blood pressure or cholesterol meds. Had i listened to my doctors for an \"easier softer way\" i would be tied to their prescription pads instead of living my life free and sober and happy and clean, with no side effects. Personally, i would consider not taking methadone and going through the flue like symptoms for a short while, and taking your life and your health back from the doctors. Just my opinion. Best of luck with yours. I've been clean and sober for 13+ years, i'm glad i'm not saying i've been on methadone for 13+ years,WHY would i do THAT to myself? I don't want that to define me for the rest of MY life.Sure i made some mistakes and dabbled (heavily) in drug use, and paid the price with a bit of withdrawal, but nothing i couldn't handle, if i'm tough enough to put a needle in my arm time and time again, i'm tough enough to handle having the flu.",

            "answer": "\"Others have quit without Methadone , to be drug free not just on a different drug.\" So TRUE Norco. The point that those of us that have taken the plunge and are clean and sober are trying to say is, Why not change your drug seeking behavior and get clean and sober, like so many of us?Don't buy into what a doctor prescribes without checking it out, there are financial gains to be made for you to stay \"addicted\" and those financial gains are NOT going into your pocket if your the employee suffering from fatique\u00a0\u00a0or any of the other effects on the list. Honestly, what would your loved ones rather hear you say, that you're getting clean and sober, or you're going on methadone, indefinitely?",

It is terribly over prescribed and was NOT meant for pill use. ****$ pill use was not meant for pill use, Oxy's , until somebody decided to get rich off the junkie mentality,\u00a0\u00a0was only used for end stage cancer, period. Most every body i've ever known that was given oxy's for anything BUT end stage cancer is a junkie now and on their way to dead, smoking them.
