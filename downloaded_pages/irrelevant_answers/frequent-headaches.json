            "answer": "Hi,Are you taking medication for your migraine attacks? I know how difficult it must be for you. But please relax, your upper back is hurting because of stress and anxiety.Since your MRI is fine so there is nothing serious to worry about.Just take one day at a time, eat your meals on time, maintain hydration, do some breathing exercises and do not stay awake past your bedtime. If your migraine attacks are\u00a0\u00a0not controlled by current treatment please discuss other treatment options with your doctor. Take care!",
