            "answer": "The most important thing is to see a doctor ASAP and start working with a good diabetes educator familiar with diabetes while pregnant as soon as possible.Your target blood sugar range will be different while you are pregnant and it is VITAL that you do everything you can to keep your sugar in range. Also, your body will need more insulin as your pregnancy advances, so you will need to make adjustments.The good news is that with monitoring, you can have a healthy baby :)",
