            "answer": "I have SPMS and do not qualify for the normal DMD so I am on CellCept which is an immunosuppressant at high dosage which basically shuts down my immune system. It is normally used for transplant patients.I have not been on any steroids in over a year and then it was just predisone tablets. My A1C has been climbing every year and last year it was at 6.3 which is high but not prediabetes\u00a0\u00a0level ( 6.4 is that level).It really isn't a fear of needles as I have no problem if someone else sticks me ( as long as I can watch them doing it ). It is just me sticking myself that is the problem.Dennis",

    "question": "Last night I went on-line too check my labs from last July and found several tests where either low or high indications.The VA just started the on-line access to your labs which I like having so that I can find out what was checked and the results. When my PC orders lab work she never tells me what she ordered.The most disturbing, though I have been expecting it for some time since diabetes runs in my family\u00a0\u00a0was the\u00a0\u00a0HEMOGLOBIN A1C/HEMOGLOBIN.TOTAL of 6.6%. This level indicates I now have diabetes. I sure hope they don't want me to start checking my sugar levels daily with one of those monitors. My friend Dave has diabetes and a month or so ago for kicks we decided to check my levels on his monitor. Well no matter how hard I tried I just could not bring myself to stab my finger so he did that part. In the past when I have been stung my a wasp I could not even use one of those auto-injectors to give myself a shot of Epi to save my life.Other results were as follows;ALKALINE PHOSPHATASE \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0208.0 High \tU/L \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a038-126\u00a0\u00a0 (Liver / bone )CHOLESTEROL HDL \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a027.0\u00a0\u00a0 Low \tmg/dl \t40-59CHOLESTEROL.TOTAL\u00a0\u00a0\t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 High \tRATIO \t0-5.5CREATININE \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a01.55\u00a0\u00a0 High \tmg/dL \t0.70-1.30\u00a0\u00a0( Liver )GLOMERULAR FILTRATION RATE \t45.8\u00a0\u00a0 Low \tmL/min \t>60\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0( Liver )TRIGLYCERIDE \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0302\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0High \tmg/dL \t40-200THYROTROPIN \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a07.31\u00a0\u00a0 High \tuIU/mL \t0.55-4.78\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0( Thyroid )CALCIDIOL \t\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a028.3\u00a0\u00a0 Low \tng/mL \t32.0-100.0\u00a0\u00a0( Vit.
