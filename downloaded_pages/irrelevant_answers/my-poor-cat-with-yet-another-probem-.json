Cat nip will get them going on the rare occasion I give it to them.\u00a0\u00a0Try different things- it may help.",

            "answer": "Oh dear, I have even bought a stroller for Abby. In my desperation, I have bought so many different types of toys I just don't know which ones are the baby's and which ones are the cats'!! If I take out the cat tunnel he won't play in there like he used to. He will sleep in there. The cat tree is like a gym to my other cat. Abby considers that a nice cozy bed. He used to play Fetch. Not anymore. I do notice that when I introduce new toys Abby will hold back and let Dillan have all the fun even though he is just as curious and wants to play just as much. The only thing I have that makes him run a bit is the laser. But when Dillan jumps in Abby stops playing. Always.....for everything we do....when Dillan joins us....Abby stops, turns around.......and leaves. This has been happening since he got sick with fatty liver disease. Yet he is the one who gets most of the attention. I do not get it.But, I will keep looking around see what other toys might interest him :-)",

            "answer": "hi Pk, I know you are very aware of this site...but have you read on the obesity link?www.catinfo.org/?link=felineobesityas you are aware dry food is so much higher in calories than wet. and higher in carbs, cats don't digest starches thus abdominal obesity and diabetes are often a result.another thought, was Abby on lots of steroids during his recovery?....could he have developed cushings disease?...symptoms of lethargy, pot bellied despite eating less, and development of diabetes.Or hyperthyroidism and the inability to burn calories efficiently?depression thus not interested in playing....or just plain not feeling well(?)what is it about wet food that causes his IBS diarrhea? it must be something he can't tolerate int he food itself, do you know what ingredient? have you tried mixing some psyllium with it this maybe enough to prevent the diarrhea and also psyllium stabilizes blood sugar levels....just throwing some thoughts out there, I know you've done tons or research on your own and are probably way ahead on all this stuff so forgive me if I'm being repetitious.(?)just don't want this lovely little guy to be ill again!!!\u2665",

            "answer": "Opus,Yes dear I have read a lot about feline obesity. There is also plenty of info on www.catnutrition.org. This is why I do not laugh about it when I say he is FAT. It isn\u2019t funny but dangerous.I have never thought of those possible problems, such as depression or hyperthyroidism. I will talk to the vet about that. Very interesting!As for the dry food. Gosh honey I know and trust me\u2026..I feel so bad every time he eats that c rap.\u00a0\u00a0But it is the only food which keeps his IBD in control, and keeps his appetite good so his liver functions won\u2019t be affected. This is the food that saved him! The vet recommends that I do not change diets, and I understand. With his history it is best to stick to just one type of food. He has been anorexic in the past and I don\u2019t want to get to that point ever again.I have tried ALL wet foods, including the very expensive, close to being more natural ones with zero good results. Zippo! I guess it\u2019s the juice or perhaps the protein. I guess even though they claim the foods are natural the protein still goes through some sort of process which makes them bad for Abby. Or perhaps it is Abby who is super sensitive to anything other than raw foods. He had been doing so well on raw food. He was fit and his fur..Gosh it was perfect! But he refuses to eat it now!He really doesn\u2019t eat much of this food but he likes it. And I cannot offer less because my other cat is in perfect condition.\u00a0\u00a0Dillan went through blood tests recently. I always tell my vet to test for absolutely everything. It all came back normal.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, Abby\u2019s weight is alarming.Now that I think about it he does seem depressed. He is just not the same cat anymore and I have no idea how to bring him back or what is causing it. You know, every time Dillan approaches him he\u2019ll growl. That\u2019s a sign that he does not feel well. And this has been going on for months. But with my extremely difficult pregnancy and post-partum experiences I overlooked and pretty much neglected my poor Abby.",

You didn't neglect Abby dear, you did all you could given the set of circumstances that you were dealt. You were barely able to care for yourself for months now, IMO you did amazingly well to hold it all together!!!!You are giving Abby the best possible life you can for as long as you can, you can do no more than that!!! remember you are not in control of whatever is going on, if you should change foods he suffers another set of problems, therefore whatever is going on isn't within your controlllllllllll you are NOT a trained Vet.lke I mentioned IF he had been on steroids during his illness this could now be causing hyperT or cushings......symptoms, depression,lethargy,pot bellied and diabetes...it may NOT have anything at all to do with food, I was just throwing out anything that came to mind............GOD this is so frustrating when we know something isn't right and we can't put our finger on what it is or why.Has Abby had blood work done recently?..that will be the place to start at and I do hope your Vet can give you some answers.If I find out anything relevant I will let you know, please keep us updated hon and please never ever blame yourself you are the best possible mommy out there we all know that already.....\u2665",

They performed a biopsy and found lots of fat in the liver and inflammation in the colon (IBD) So they gave me steroids. What you say then makes perfect sense.In trying to get him all better I may created another problem!",

Had I known that when he was four months old I would have never given him steroids :( I didn't know steroids could make a cat diabetic!! Some say ignorance is bliss. Hmmm.........not all the time it isn't :) You are right. And we need to be careful when we give medication to our pets long term. There will always be side effects. A pill can improve something AND break something else at the same time!Maddie,Abby has been seen by specialists. I have had referals from his vets. The hospital I have taken him to is about 45 minutes from my house. I would drive almost every day to go see him after he had surgery. It was horrible!Aligator,Thank You!!! I appreciate the kind words. I'm afraid Abby will keep giving me heartaches, and I will always feel guilty. I will always feel like I could have done something to prevent it!

            "answer": "I'm so sorry to hear this about Abby, PK. :(I don't know what I can tell you that can help. I noticed others mentioned Cushings. Willow had that, remember? Did your vet test for that? I'm assuming they tested for just about everything!I hope that with some time and a calm environment, he will come around. You're right, you all have gone through a lot of changes and cats hate change.I know as they get older they're not quite as playful but I would think he'd still be interested, even if he's not playing as much.Sakura does that too, with the light laser. She's interested but the other cat (my son's kitten) goes after it first and since she's faster she kind of pushes past Sakura and Sakura gives up. But Sakura will still play with her and the puppies and try to mother them all.I'm a bit in the same boat as you with the weight thing. I've noticed recently that Sakura has gotten quite fat. I didn't think she was eating that much, either, so I'm stumped. She acts healthy otherwise. I do feed dry food because that's what the other cat eats but I'm thinking I maybe should keep the cats food seperated and take Sakura to the vet and get a low cal diet for her.Anyway, this isn't about Sakura, though. I do hope little Abby will start to feel better. Give him lots of love and cuddles. I pray things turn around soon for you all. Hugs to you and Abby!",

Can an animal remain in shock after months of suffering a potentially deadly illness? What happened???Now here is my issue: I am feeding him a special diet from the vet, specifically made for cats with food sensitivity and cats who have had hepatic lipidosis. I have made numerous attempts to get him to eat raw foods again but every attempt has failed. He just stops eating altogether. The food is dry so it doesn't help with the fact that he is already fat.
