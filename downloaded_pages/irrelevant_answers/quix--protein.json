            "answer": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0No, the two things have nothing to do with each other.\u00a0\u00a0What you had may have been mild pre-eclampsia which is the high blood pressure of pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0The kidneys start to function less well and leak protein into the urine.\u00a0\u00a0Also the feet swell sometimes, the BP goes up and they watch you like a hawk.\u00a0\u00a0Your neurologist does not need this info.In MS the high protein refers to high levels of protein in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and indicates inflammation and often antibody production (antibodies are protein) often against parts of the nerves like myelin.Hope that helps, Quix",

    "question": "Hi, Quix.\u00a0\u00a0I had one question.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed everyone saying high protein level.The only time I've ever heard that, was when I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0About half way through the pregnancy onward, all my urine tests came back with high levels of protein, but all the glucose tolerance tests were considered normal.\u00a0\u00a0Only the first one showed slight abnormality, and the second test confirmed I did not have gestational diabetes.Is this something significant?\u00a0\u00a0I don't think I have told the neurologist this.\u00a0\u00a0I just thought of it.",
