These include injury to the back or spinal cord, Lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis,motor neuron disease,lupus erythematosus and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body,malnutrition and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause tingling in the knee and legs.

    "question": "Hello, I am a 23 year old male 140 lbs and about 5'9\". I have been suffering from Nausea, Fatigue, and Numbness/cold hands and feet for about 3-4 years. Also I tend to only have a bowel movement about 2-3 times a week. A little background info. Overall very healthy. The only serious injury/health problem was in 2003 when I broke/dislocated both feet and broke my pelvis in a motorcycle accident. 2 years after that I started experiencing the above symptoms. I have suffered from pain in the joints that were affected but I believe something else it causing these symptoms. All the doctors I have seen (PCP, Pain management, and Neurologist) all believe that I am just experiencing pain from arthritis. I get that and accept that but I should not wake up every morning feeling so weak sometime I dont even want to get out of bed. I am fatigued throughout the day and get very nauseated (which causes a loss of appetite). My hands and feet are also always numb and cold. I have been on multiple medicine for nerve pain and depression to try and alleviate some of the pain. I recieved one diagnosis from blood test from the neurologist I was seeing. He told me that I was malnutrition. He said he wasnt too concerned about it but he did administer a couple of b12 shots over the next couple months. That was in 2006. I then moved and have not even thought twice about the diagnosis until now. What would you suggest? Over the past year I have visited multiple docs trying to figure something out but have yet to find any answers.",
