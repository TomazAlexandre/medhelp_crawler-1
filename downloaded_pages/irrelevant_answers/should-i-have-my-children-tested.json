            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0Many of these issues show themselves over time.\u00a0\u00a0We diagnose some things also by symptoms such as depression.\u00a0\u00a0Can't really test for that before symptoms arise.\u00a0\u00a0PTSD is under the anxiety umbrella but typically has an event attached to it that caused the trauma.\u00a0\u00a0However, anxiety is a component of that and this is a chemical imbalance that someone could have. However, again, someone must present with symptoms to be screened for it.\u00a0\u00a0 Yes, these mental health issues and the others do run in families.\u00a0\u00a0Doesn't mean that every person born into a family will have them by any means.I think a good way of thinking about this if we are talking about children is to be watchful of them.\u00a0\u00a0If they show signs of these medical conditions surfacing----\u00a0\u00a0be prepared.\u00a0\u00a0Know when to act and get them help to intervene.\u00a0\u00a0AND, most importantly, help set them up for a life time to combat them.Example, if heart issues run in your famiily-----\u00a0\u00a0make sure the kids lead active lifestyles with plenty of exercise, make sure they maintain a good weight and good eating habits.\u00a0\u00a0Make that a family affair-----\u00a0\u00a0healthy balanced dinner, family bike ride after.\u00a0\u00a0A low cholesterol diet is helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Watching sugar, etc.\u00a0\u00a0No soda pop, low on sugary sweets, processed food, etc.good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Most families these days have members with many health issues in their background.",

            "answer": "Hi, well you can do the blood work to see if the children were BORN with high cholesterol which does happen.\u00a0\u00a0This is a risk factor for heart disease and can lead to heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0That one you can test for.\u00a0\u00a0OR you can begin the children on a low cholesterol diet that will benefit them and they take through life.There are MANY symptoms of hypothyroidism and congestive heart failure early on.\u00a0\u00a0I personally have hypothryoidism and can tell you first hand that symptoms are present that you notice.\u00a0\u00a0Congestive heart failure as well has destinctive symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0BUT, it is also a disease that many develop over time.\u00a0\u00a0To the best of my knowledge, there is not a genetic test to see if a child will actually develop it.\u00a0\u00a0Instead, one notes it is in their family history and try to do what they can to set a child up with a lifestyle to make it less likely that any lifestyle factors contribute to it.We have depression in our family on my husband's side.\u00a0\u00a0Mental health issues can run in families.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if my kids will develop mental health issues\u00a0\u00a0but as their mother , I just look for symptoms to appear.\u00a0\u00a0Then you treat it.\u00a0\u00a0That is the normal course of action.Many of the issues you speak of are not childhood issues but rather things that are more middle age and late age.Diabetes, for example, I assume you are talking about type 2.\u00a0\u00a0That is directly related to weight.\u00a0\u00a0Many older folks get it as they age because they become more sedentary and pick up weight.\u00a0\u00a0Kids that are obese also can get type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So, as a parent, I'd make sure my kids eat a healthy diet, get plenty of exercise, maintain a good weight and not worry about it.\u00a0\u00a0Then hopefully they will continue that lifestyle themselves as adults and not develop type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 diabetes is different.\u00a0\u00a0That has a childhood onset as well but does have a destinctive set of symptoms that come along with it.So, I guess\u00a0\u00a0my point is that awareness is wonderful but testing a child for coronary artery disease seems pointless as they probably won't have it as a child and the test is meaningless for when they are older and more likley to develop it.\u00a0\u00a0Beyond cholesterol testing, heart disease usually happens over time unless there is a heart defect at birth.A more prudent and productive option is to create a healthful lifestyle for the kids now.\u00a0\u00a0good luck",
