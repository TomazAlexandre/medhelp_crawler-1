            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling? What is your name?I think you are having what I feel is Restless Leg Syndrome.Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurological disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the legs and an uncontrollable urge to move when at rest in an effort to relieve these feelings.Chronic diseases like kidney disease, diabetes, and peripheral neuropathy are also cause for RLS.If you are moving about in bed to relieve pain, have creepy and crawly feeling in leg, motor restlessness with increase in symptoms as night progresses, a diagnosis of RLS is certain.I think you should consult physician and another neurologist to re-evaluate your case.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,The other causes of tingling and numbness can be nerve root pain due to nerve compression at the lower back, but you have done imaging, which is reported as essentially normal.The other causes can be due to Vitamin B12 deficiency, or Blood pressure irregularities causing such symptoms.You can get yourself evaluated by a physician and cardiologist to look for other causes of your symptoms.Bye.Happy holidays to you.",
