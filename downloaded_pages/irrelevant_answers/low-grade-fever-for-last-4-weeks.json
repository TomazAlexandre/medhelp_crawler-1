            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!An evening rise of temperature is generally due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroid states, overwork, stress and fatigue. It is also seen in diseases like tuberculosis. GERD can also contribute. If diabetes is kept under control, you drink fluids, eat healthy and keep GERD under control by drugs and life style changes, then you will be able to have a normal body temperature throughout the day. You need to find out whether you have anemia and thyroid problems too. Please consult your PCP for this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
