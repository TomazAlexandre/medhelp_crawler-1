I sometimes get frustrated because my ob Dr says one thing about my levels and my perinatal specialist and diabetes educator say something else. Checking your levels is for your safety and that of your baby. Especially in the last few weeks, at 39weeks the risk of stillbirth goes up drastically if sugars are not well controlled.",

            "answer": "speaking as someone who had gd and now full type 2 I understand the frustration with doctors trying to control your levels ... My\u00a0\u00a0doctors were indecisive about just changing my meds or putting me on insulin.... I hate needles. but typically the reason for the indecision is setting so you won't have lows while controlling levels. I've had a few lows abd they are awful. it's so confusing because they change your dosage repeatedly. because you are so close to the end they want to be extra cautious and gd can be well controlled with diet cutting out bread had.helped me now.. I'm surprised they didn't send you to specialist clinic where the doc makes all decisions...just stick in there to have a healthy little one and be healthy as well praying for you and yours. and check your sugars this is my third and they repeat the risks to let you know how serious it is I didn't want to check regularly either but they should be around 80-90 before eating and under 120after as you may know",

    "question": "So two weeks ago I stopped going to my gestational diabetes doc because she wasn't sure on wether to give me insuling or not. Every appointment was something different. At first she said I didn't need it then had me do an A1C test even tho she said she knew my results were gonna be normal. I was getting very irritated and so was my boyfriend. My mother is a registered nurse and she even didn't understand Why she wasn't sure Like cmon. So my obIs thinking I ain't taking this gd seriously and it upsets me for her to think like that. She wants my readings and I haven't been keeping track of my numbers since I stopped going. I'm due in 6 days. Its driving me nuts.",
