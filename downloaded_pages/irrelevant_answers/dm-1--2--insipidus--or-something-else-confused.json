            "answer": "Jemma,I know I didn't mention this initially, but I have seen plenty of doctors already following a hospitalization for Pneumomediastinum and a subsequent infection that ensued in my chest & throat about a month ago. They prescribed me penicillin which did not knock it out after a one-week course, so my primary later prescribed me 875 /125 Augmentin (amoxicillin) to finish it off. The Augmentin certainly knocked the infection out of my throat, but since that time I have noticed unexplained weight loss, low body temps, bradycardia, and lower blood pressure than I'm accustomed to, with occasional blurry vision and increasingly frequent lightheadedness.Now, I didn't mention this initially because my CBC with differential came back with vastly improved WBC, neutrophils, and lymphocytes following the antibiotic treatment and I recently had my CRP, ESR, and Procalcitonin levels checked via blood work, all of which came back clean---indicating no systemic infection. I was more concerned with my recent polyuria, increased wound susceptibility (I cut my hands and bruise all over my body much easier now), and my vitals continuing to be way off. It is really affecting all aspects of my life right now, and I just want to get things normalized by any means necessary.Again, I know my blood sugar indicates prediabetes, but is 97 (fasted), 104 (1 hr), 124 (3 hours), and 102 after almost 5 hours following a high carb, high protein, moderate fat meal really going to cause my kidneys to dump glucose from my body at all times of the day---including all throughout the night? This just seems like it was too sudden to induce such a volume of urine (5-6 liters measured and confirmed everyday...normal is 1.5-2.5). By my understanding, UTIs could induce more frequent urination, but not polyuria to this degree.I'm seeing my doctor Thursday regardless, I just wanted some feedback on my glucose measurements and whether such modest numbers could induce this kind of excessive urination. I figured the body only started excreting excess glucose once you got into the 140+ range, not with a fasted glucose right around 100...but I don't have a lot of expertise here, so I was hoping someone could help clarify whether it sounded like DM1, DM2, DI, or none of them. The urine appears foamy and varying degrees of yellow to amber when peeing into a bottle, but less dark and foamy when peeing into a toilet bowl.Also, I recently (2 weeks ago) had a urinalysis done which came back clean, and a metabolic panel which also looked clean, with an eGFR of 102, BUN of 19 mg/dL, Creatinine of 0.99 mg/dL---all within reference range.Thanks again for everyone's help!",

            "answer": "I apologize for trying to self-diagnose and I am trying not to obsess about this, but I have lost 15 pounds while eating 2000 calories a day over the last month and while my circulation numbers appear healthy, they are very low for me and have been causing me a myriad of problems---from lightheadedness, to numbness in my extremities, and numerous myalgias throughout my body that plague me on a daily basis. My heart rate drops into the mid 40s while I'm in bed now and my blood pressure is 95 /60 in the mornings now, and beyond it being disconcerting, I can feel these effects throughout my body and I notice the difference from when I had a bp of 135 /75; blood just isn't circulating like it used to.The polyuria is only the most recent symptom, but I figured since my hemoglobin A1C was in prediabetic range and my blood glucose was a little high, that maybe diabetes was a good place to start.And listen, I know I probably seem crazy, but as someone who is very in-tune with their body (I exercise frequently, eat right, and have always maintained a healthy physique and body), I know that something is awry; all the measurements provided earlier were not estimates, they were confirmed via multiple instruments and measurements prior to the infection. When my body temperature stays in the 96 degree range (confirmed with multiple thermometers), trust me when I tell you that I can FEEL that temperature permeating through my hands, feet, and entire body---even while wearing a jacket and pants in a 77 degree room. This is all new to me, so I feel compelled to figure out what's causing it.My faith in the medical industry has been eroded by several misdiagnoses over the last month alone, so forgive me if I appear paranoid or anxious, but I have to be my own advocate and try to figure out what's going on inside my body right now.",

            "answer": "Your Haemoglobin level of A1C 5.8 according to EMedicineHealth is classed as pre-diabetes.HbA1C level of 5.7 to 6.4 is classed as pre-diabetes.HbA1C level of 6.5 and higher is classed as having diabetes.Ask your doctor to refer you for a fasting glucose test.Pre-diabetes is usually treated by lifestyle changes.Your symptoms of light headedness and feeling shaking could be caused by low sugar levels called hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0Always carry a healthy snack with you to avoid low sugar levels and don't wait until you get these symptoms before you eat something.\u00a0\u00a0If you do get those symptoms a bar of chocolate or a glucose sweet may make you feel better quicker, but these raise the sugar levels very quickly for it to plummet down again quickly.To stop your blood sugar levels dropping low and causing symptoms, you need to eat little and often.\u00a0\u00a0The types of foods you should be eating are the slow release energy foods.\u00a0\u00a0Cut out or cut down on all sugary foods, processed and junk foods as well as fruit juices, squashes, energy drinks, alcohol, fizzy drinks.Although fruit contains fructose, which as you will know is a type of sugar, when you eat the whole fruit, you also get the fibre in the fruit that is broken down more slowly than if you were to drink a fresh fruit drink.Wheetabix, Shredded Wheat, porridge are good slow release energy foods. You can add some soft fruit, and sprinkle with cinnamon if you like.Look at food labels to make sure that the sugar content is low.\u00a0\u00a0Low fat and some \"healthy\" foods are laden with sugar, so do read the food labels.You can find more information on healthy eating and slow release energy foods on the web.Even with an HbA1C level of 5.8, you doctor would not put you on any medication for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He will tell you to change your lifestyle and will monitor your sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Do bear in mind that the HbA1C blood tests show the average blood glucose levels in a period of 9-12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Every 9-12 weeks the red corpuscles get renewed and the glucose sticks to the old corpuscles.I agree with you that you can experience skin issues and other ailments like nerve damage with prediabetes or glucose intolerance.I appreciate that you have had a bad experience with doctors and have lost your trust in them (I have had a similar experience more than once with misdiagnosis), but the doctor is your first port of call to refer you for the appropriate tests or to specialists, unless of course, you pay privately to see a consultant.If it helps, keep a food diary of what you eat and drink and how you feel. Have a healthy breakfast, followed a couple of hours later with a healthy snack.\u00a0\u00a0Have a well balanced and healthy dinner and again a healthy snack a few hours later and your evening meal, which should also be a healthy and balanced meal.\u00a0\u00a0Healthy snacks include fruit, vegetables, handful of nuts, natural unsweetened yogurt.Do bear in mind that sugar levels can also be influenced if you feel unwell, have any steroid medication or injections.\u00a0\u00a0The colour of your urine can also change from some medications and some foods and drinks.\u00a0\u00a0For example, eating beetroot will discolour your urine to a pinky tinge.Some foods are natural diuretics - celery, cucumber for example.If you bruise easily, it may be worth checking your liver function.Make a list of your symptoms and your concerns to present to your doctor when you see him.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor may prefer to read your written list rather than you tell him verbally your concerns.\u00a0\u00a0He will then ask you questions.\u00a0\u00a0I find giving the doctor a list of symptoms is better than telling him.I know that you feel very anxious about your health concerns, but try and stay calm.\u00a0\u00a0Stress and anxiety is no good for your health.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure your girlfriend is also very worried about your health issues, but try not to let your ill health take over and mar your relationship with your girlfriend.If you do any type of work that can cause cuts or puncture wounds to your skin even by bugs, cover up.\u00a0\u00a0Do bear in mind, that bacteria can enter through any breaks in the skin, no matter how small they may be.\u00a0\u00a0If you do notice any reddening of the skin, pain to touch and the skin feeling hot, that could be an infection called Cellulitis, and a course of antibiotics or treatment by penicillins would be needed.\u00a0\u00a0Do not neglect any cuts, scratches, or other puncture wounds to your skin.I did not comment about your HbA1C levels before, as I have had to check the UK and US measurements.\u00a0\u00a0You can find more information about the HbA1C levels and your home glucose monitor levels on diabetic web sites.I hope the doctor listens to your concerns on Thursday and is able to help you.Let me know how you get on.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Sally, thanks again for being so diligent and following up. I have been trying desperately to make an appointment with an endocrinologist, but the earliest appointments are more than a month from now, and I frankly can't wait that long to be seen given the water loss I'm experiencing. My appointment with my primary is tomorrow, but best-case scenario I will get a urinalysis and metabolic panel ordered during that visit. I WILL go in fasted though to try and obtain a reliable fasted glucose reading.I lowered my carbs today and I'm still peeing a substantial amount (about 70 ounces so far). The pee is dark yellow and somewhat foamy, but I have consumed 72 ounces of water already. I am hesitant to just keep drinking a surplus of plain water to counteract this because I don't want to continue flushing out my electrolytes. Regardless, I am planning on making long-term lifestyle changes to get my health back in order. I clearly can't keep shoving carbs down my gullet just because I'm thin and in shape, as this is having serious consequences in my body right now.I just don't understand how this could have started so seemingly abruptly when my last 4 random readings were just slightly above 100. If I have modestly elevated blood glucose levels, why would my kidneys be dumping this much sugar out of my system---and why would it persist all night long? I still have yet to see my blood sugar exceed 125 even at peak blood glucose levels, so I'm not sure how this could have happened so quickly, or if it's even possible to experience severe polyuria with such mild hyperglycemia. I'm also not sure how this explains the lower blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature, and all the circulation issues I've been experiencing. I definitely do not have advanced diabetes, so this is all very confusing to me. Thyroid tests will probably be my best bet, but I can't see an endo for a while, so I'm not sure exactly how I'm going to approach this moving forward. I'll see if my Primary will order the Free T3 and T4 tests for me, despite the fact that I just had the \"total\" of each type measured not long ago.Finally, why does my blood sugar not spike until 3 hours after a meal? Is it the fat and protein content that are causing that? I will do more finger pricks, talk to my doctor tomorrow, and report back. Thanks again for all your help.",

I peed full bladders (16-20 ounces) every few hours during the morning and afternoon yesterday, but between the hours of 4:30 and 9:30 (I lifted from 5-6), I didn't pee once, and was actually a bit heavier this morning since I skipped a urination and went those 5 hours without peeing (which is the longest I've gone in several weeks). I actually felt the desire to urinate wane substantially after I did a few sets of bench press sets which sent blood traveling to my upper body, and the urgency was diminished even several hours after my last set. I would call this a fluke if not for the fact that I've observed the same effect during my previous 2 workouts.

            "answer": "Hello,given that your blood sugar doesn't go above 125, then you frequent urination could be due to something other than diabetes.Your noticing that you don't have to pee after exertion could be related to the metabolism that happens when you work out, and also the distraction.\u00a0\u00a0When you are working out you are not drinking...Also, if you drink so much, you are going to pee so much.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe the drinking so much is a habit?\u00a0\u00a0Just asking?Peaking blood sugar after 3 hours shows that your pancreas seems to be ok at first, but can't keep putting out enough insulin to keep things stable.\u00a0\u00a0In persons who are non-diabetic, their blood sugar will be pretty close to the fasting levels all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Eating very low carb will help keep your blood sugars stable.The standard tests are:-Fasting1.5 - 2 hours after breakfast\u00a0\u00a0(this tells you your peak)Before lunch (this tells you did your sugar come down again to fasting level between meals)1.5 - 2 hours after lunch\u00a0\u00a0(Peak)Before dinner1.5 - 2 hours after dinner (Peak)Bed time.YOu don't need to test each of these every day, but these will guide you in what foods don't have impact on your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe you can one day eat a standard meal.\u00a0\u00a0See what happens to your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0The next time tweak that meal to make it lower carb, and then test again.\u00a0\u00a0Until you find that your blood sugar is stable.Any infection can cause type 1.\u00a0\u00a0However, your blood sugar not obviously going above 125 is very reassuring.Are you taking any vitamins or supplements?\u00a0\u00a0These can affect urine colour and consistency?Good Luck Tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0let us know how you go.Tomorrow, do a repeat Hba1c.\u00a0\u00a0Ask about the frequent urination and they can do basic kidney function tests.\u00a0\u00a0Get a referral to an endrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Though it is frustrating, you are not at critical level, and a wait of 1 month should be bearable.Work on this low approach.\u00a0\u00a0You really do need to cut the sugars and carbs (see my example above).\u00a0\u00a0When you feel stressed.",

            "answer": "Type 1 diabetes is when the pancreas does not produce any insulin.Even with any type of infection, the blood sugar levels will be difficult to control, but it is still Type 2 diabetes.At the moment, you have NOT been diagnosed as having diabetes and the sugar levels your last HbA1C showed were that classed as pre-diabetes.There is no point in speculation and worrying and stressing yourself out unduly.Like I mentioned previously, keep a written record of everything that you eat and drink and the exercise that you do and keep a note of how you feel.There is no point in having a blood test to check your HbA1C levels more than 1 every 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0The blood corpuscles get renewed around that time and the glucose sticks to the old corpuscles to get the average read out in that period.Let us know how you get on at your appointment.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Update:\u00a0\u00a0Doctor basically told me that my blood glucose levels are not adequate to stimulate polyuria (said it required hyperglycemia well over the 120 level), yet didn't know how to explain the Hemoglobin A1C number... also told me that peeing over a gallon a day is not that unusual (which is flat-out wrong), and ordered a CBC, Metabolic Panel, Urinalysis, testosterone and prostate test. Wouldn't order additional thyroid tests and didn't believe anything was wrong with my heart rate dropping into the low 40s and said I was just fit and that's why my heart rate was so low, completely ignoring the fact that it never dropped this low prior to my infection over a month ago and that I've been largely sedentary over the last month and can't put any weight on. Oh well, not much I can do at this point besides waiting for my results to come back and staying hydrated, but there was no glucose in my urine and I still can't stop peeing. Told me to make an appointment with an Endo, but (as mentioned earlier) the earliest I can do that is a month from now. I'll just keep trying to make sooner appointments I suppose and figure out what's going on with my heart. Thanks for everyone's help, but it looks like I'm not gonna be able to determine much from this bloodwork unless the metabolic panel reveals something new from 3 weeks ago (which I don't think it will).

            "answer": "Well, I certainly would be happy with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He is referring for lots of tests and you can't grumble about that.I am glad that he is going to check your prostate.Do bear in mind that the heart rate will drop if you are sedentary and will then pump faster when you start to exercise and move about.Like Super_sally888 mentions, the more you drink, the more you will pee.\u00a0\u00a0Limit your fluid intake to no more than 2 litres a day, unless you are sweating.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking excessive amounts of fluids can be very dangerous.You mentioned in your previous post that when you do a workout, you do not go to empty your bladder.\u00a0\u00a0This is very strange, because if you had a urinary problem, it would still happen even if you were working out.The other thing is then whether you drank less that day, ate something different, or was not stressed and anxious due to concentrating on your workout.\u00a0\u00a0Do bear in mind that stress and anxiety will also make you go more often for a pee.Dip stick sugar levels in the urine are only detected when the levels are 11 mmol/L and above (UK levels); 198 mg/L and above (US levels).If you are concerned about losing weight and not putting any weight on, increase your calorie intake for the day eating a healthy and well balanced diet.\u00a0\u00a0 Weight loss and lack of weight gain can simply be to the fact that you are not taking in enough calories and burning more calories that you are taking in.Be thankful that the doctor has ordered lots of tests and has not just fobbed you off, despite the fact that he was not concerned about your low heart rate and decided not to do another thyroid test.If all the tests come back fine, and you are still not gaining weight, get checked out for parasites, like tapeworm.Learn to relax and enjoy your life.",

            "answer": "Thanks Jemma, I definitely do need to relax! It's very difficult though when I'm constantly cold regardless of apparel and my blood pressure remains presistently low. I just want to figure this out quickly in case it has something to do with my heart or if it's diabetes. If my fasting blood glucose comes back in the mid-90s and my at-home glucose monitor doesn't reflect a reading over 140 taken 1 and 2 hours after eating straight glucose, do you think can I confidently rule out diabetes and diabetes-induced polyuria? Prediabetes is another story I know, but this would be helpful to figure out sooner rather than later so I can modify my life accordingly. I don't want to have to wait another month to see an Endo if high carbohydrate intake is causing all of my problems. I guess I will continue eating higher fat for the time-being and lower my carb intake accordingly.",

            "answer": "To be honest, I feel you are obsessing too much about checking your sugar levels at home.\u00a0\u00a0I had been glucose intolerant for 6 years before the sugar levels rose to the diabetic levels.\u00a0\u00a0I have Type 2 diabetes and my doctor and diabetic nurse does not supported me to have a home monitor - this is because my HbA1C blood levels that are checked yearly are under control.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse did say to me that the problem with home monitors is that people can get too obsessed with using them.\u00a0\u00a0 As you have not been diagnosed as having diabetes, there is no need for you to obsess about checking your sugar levels.I would suggest the time you could consider checking your sugar levels at home is if you started to feel unwell and your vision became blurry which could indicate hyperglycaemia.\u00a0\u00a0Or when you feel nausea, feel light headed and cold to see if your sugar levels are too low.\u00a0\u00a0But if you do feel like this, then eat something healthy.Unfortunately \"Rome was not built in a day\", and a month for an appointment with an Endo is not that too long.I cannot answer your question as I am not a doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor has already given you his answer.Did you tell your doctor that you feel constantly cold?Wear a thermal vest and rather than wearing one T-shirt or jumper, wear a few layers.\u00a0\u00a0You can also get some long johns to keep your legs warm, these are worn under the trousers.With you still feeling the cold, this could be due to not having gotten over the infection that you have recently had.\u00a0\u00a0I start to feel cold when I feel tired or when I need to eat something.Eat foods that contain healthy fats (polyunsaturated fats).\u00a0\u00a0These are avocados, nuts, seeds, vegetable oils, fish.\u00a0\u00a0Although coconut oil is a saturated fat, it is still a healthy option.\u00a0\u00a0Eat the saturated fats in moderation, these are the fats that are not good for a healthy heart and can also increase your bad cholesterol.\u00a0\u00a0Keep away from fast foods - an article about a certain fast food outlet has revealed that there is too much corn syrup and salt in the bread buns that can spike up sugar levels and leaving you feeling hungry to buy more.\u00a0\u00a0In the UK corn syrup has been banned in the buns and the salt is much lower.\u00a0\u00a0You will find this article on the MSN page.Read food labels, because some vegetable oils are also saturated fats.\u00a0\u00a0Eat lean white meats.You can find lots of information on the web with regard to the different fats and how they work on the body.When you eat carbohydrates, choose the ones that are not refined.\u00a0\u00a0Have brown seeded bread instead of white for example, brown rice instead of white, eat high fibre foods.\u00a0\u00a0 Lots of information on the web and on the diabetic web sites.Your last HbA1C result of 5.8 already indicates that you have pre-diabetes.Remember that the doctor has referred you for further tests, so just put your health issues to one side and have a relaxing and enjoyable time with your girlfriend.",

    "question": "Hello all! This is my first post here and I really appreciate any clarification that can be provided for me, as the last month has been very stressful and is on the brink of ruining my relationship with my girlfriend.Before I get into my DM concerns, I wanted to provide some observations I've had: I am a 29 year old 6 foot male who was (until recently) fit, somewhat-muscular, and generally in good shape. I was 178 lean lbs. at the beginning of August, and I am now 163---all with a slightly but not greatly reduced caloric intake. Lately, I have noticed LOWER vitals in terms of my blood pressure (usually 130-140 / 75, lately it's been 110-115 / 60-65), resting heart rate (48-55, usually 60-70), and body temperature (96.2 to 97.5 degrees throughout the day). For many people, this would be a welcome change; but I have felt weak, a little shaky, and perpetually cold. I also have started getting light-headed quite easily whereas before that was a very infrequent observation. I have been largely sedentary but have lifted weights approximately 5 or 6 times over the last month, yet I am more vascular and lean in appearance, have lost significant strength, and again, my heart rate is markedly slower than it was prior to all of this. I also noticed this while exercising, where my heart rate was about 13 beats slower at the same power walking speed than it was a month ago. In general, I'm just experiencing a general malaise lately that is permeating all facets of my life.Now, most of my bloodwork came back fine, but my Hemoglobin A1C was 5.8 and my random bloodwork glucose readings (all taken around 3-4 hours after eating) have been 102, 103, and 109. I bought a home glucose monitor and tested my level recently and conducted a test following one of my typical breakfasts (which included 20g fat, 75g carbohydrates, and 50g protein. I measured a fasting blood glucose of 97, 104 1hr. postprandial, 124 3 hours postprandial, and 102 4.5 hours after the meal. I assume the blood sugar spike was delayed due to the fat and protein content of my meal, but I'm not sure. Regardless, my Hemoglobin A1C and fasting glucose around 100 tell me I am prediabetic, depite my lack of obesity and no family history of type 1 (type 2 in several grandparents).The most concerning symptom that I've had over the last 2 weeks is polyuria and nocturia. I have measured urine output between 5-6 liters a day, and my water consumption is nowhere near that high. My understanding is that polyuria is comorbid with diabetes, but I don't believe that my modest blood glucose readings would lead to this much urination. I am literally peeing full bladders (16-24 oz.) 10 or more times a day, and 3-4 times at night alone ( I wake up to pee every few hours). I've also noticed some circulation and issues with skin sensitivity, for whatever that's worth, along with decreased wound healing expediency. I shake uncontrollably in the middle of the night also, but I am thinking that that has more to do with my withdrawal from Ativan (a benzodiazepene) that anything else. Is it possible for this kind of polyuria to accompany prediabetes, or is that more of an advanced symptom? I am losing water weight quickly and becoming dehydrated, and I don't have much more water to spare, so I want to figure this out quickly.Thanks in advance for everyone's help, it is much appreciated!",
