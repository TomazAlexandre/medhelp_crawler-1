            "answer": "You ask about latest breakthroughs, but you don't mention what treatment your son is currently receiving. Is he being seen by an endo? Is he on a basal/bolus regimen of insulin shots? Do you feel you and he (you don't say how old he is) have sufficient understanding of how to figure dosages? Do you know how to count carbs, and do you have an insulin/carb ratio? Have you told your endo that hs numbers remain high? I'm sorry that is a lot of questions, but rather than focus on breakthroughs that might happen down the road...and let's all hope they do!...you might want to focus on his right here and now treatment.",
