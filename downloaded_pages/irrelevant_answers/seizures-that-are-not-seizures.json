    "question": "After many visits to doctors, many EEG's, MRI's CT scans they don't don't what going on with me. I'll give you a slight history. In 2003 I fell through a chair while putting curtains back up.\u00a0\u00a0I landed on my feet. Not long after that I started jerking first it was my arms then went to full body jerks. The doctors rans test but didn't know what started them or what they were. I went to a neuroloist and he labeled them myoclonic jerks. he put me on different medicines but the only thing that controlled them was clonazepam. Then in 2011 I had a total knee replacement and due to lack of money I couldn't take my clonazepam.I started having seizure like eposides. Where I would just start jerking and they got worse ended up in the ER many times. Symtoms are: I will get this funny feeling in my hands and feet and start jerking. I know whats going on around me, I but at times I can't respond to whats being said. The last trip to the er had them saying they thought they were maybe stress related siezures or pseudo siezures. Any help you can give me would be greatly appreciated because they have deprived me of my abilty to work and drive. Thank you very\u00a0\u00a0much for your time.",
