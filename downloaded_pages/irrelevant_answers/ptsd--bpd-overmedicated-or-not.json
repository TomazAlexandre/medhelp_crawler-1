            "answer": "Has he been clinically diagnosed with tardive dyskinesia? The two antipsychotics he is on in combination will worsen it. You should have him see a movement disorders specialist who can diagnose the tardive dyskinesia and then a psychiatrist if that is confirmed would switch him to Clozaril which is the only antipsychotic that cannot cause tardive dyskinesia that is a current medication. As well a movement disorders specialist who is a neurologist would provide treatment for the tardive dyskinesia. And you should be aware of new antipsychotics in development such as glycine which I am on in Phase II FDA study which is a glutamate antagonist a new class of antipsychotic which cannot cause or worsen tardive dyskinesia or diabetes and has been shown to promote a full recovery. But the most important thing is to take him to a movement disorders specialist to have the tardive dyskinesia diagnosed and treated.",

            "answer": "I'm in agreement with \"Mark TX\" , thats 4 more med's than I ever want to see someone on, especially the types. If it were my brother and he was able to communicate, I'd ask him if he would like to see a trusted doc and see about starting over. It sounds like he has been passed around and someone added to the mix each time as to qwell one new symptom with a new drug when all along they should be looking to the what the root cause is. In the ED I have seen this many times over, and \"zombie\" is not a state to be in. I would really try to get him to someone willing to take a look at what is really going on so you can have your brother back instead of what you have now. Just my opinion.",
