            "answer": "In tasmania Australia you have to do the 3 hour test straight up.\u00a0\u00a0Saves them wasting time I guess. The not eating part is not so bad because you just book an early appointment and fast overnight. ***** not having breakfast though. Don't be too worried about it. The first test is easy to fail because all it takes it the timing to be slightly wrong or you ate too much sugar that day etc. This gives them a clear picture. If it comes back positive they will help you work out an eating plan to manage your sugar. The main side effect is your baby can grow overly large so they'll keep a closer eye on your baby too",
