            "answer": "I had gestational diabetes with my last pregnancy and actually lost 15lbs due to the diet. I weighed 260 after I lost the weight so my Dr was happy. I had also felt unattractive but my hubby was there to reassure me that I was still hott only cuz my boobs are a 42F. Im on only 5'1 but im thick I guess lol. As long as you are healthy and your BP is good your baby should be fine. I know it's hard not to worry but try. You can always go back to normal with diet and exercise. Anything is possible if you really want it.",
