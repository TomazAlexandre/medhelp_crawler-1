            "answer": "Dont take any drugs. Pot is has its benefits but not when smoked. it create and emits toxins. You have to change your diet to reverse diabetes. Its so simple and many dont understand the powers of foods .. im going to try to poste a link for you to watch not sure if the site will block it out but if you can see this link .. simply go go youtube and type in \"cure diabetes on a raw food diet\" .. basically raw foods means anything not cooked. Fruits vegetables etc. and im taking about raw vegan, so you wouldnt exactly eat raw meat .. lol . .so coming off meats and becoming a raw food vegan .. if not 100% at first at least most of your foods ..http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qILQfi-PNSw",

            "answer": "Although I agree with you about the drugs issue, I don't think you can reverse type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The only treatment for type 1 is insulin and once you have type 1 you are diabetic for life, whatever you eat.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, what you eat as a diabetic, is very important and you should follow a healthy, well balanced diet.\u00a0\u00a0There is no cure, just insulin treatment and diet to control the condition.",

            "answer": "You sound like a smart person, mm, because you realize that you have choices and that with diabetes you have to take special care of yourself. I think you should trust your instinct and stay away from drugs. I know that all adults say that and that you know that if you \"try pot one time\" nothing horrible will happen to you. But you also have a friend who is an example of what can happen after that. It's way too easy (especially when you are your age and have all the peer pressure) to get into drugs and do them on a regular basis. For someone with diabetes that has lots of dangers besides the usual ones: If you are depressed, like your friend, it can cover up those feelings and keep you from getting the help you need. Pot also gives you the munchies and you might be tempted to eat things that aren't good for you. Drugs of all kinds reduce inhibitions and impair judgement. That is, you don't think as much about what you are doing. For a diabetic that can be critical because you need to stay alert to test your blood sugar, take the right doses of insulin, etc. Even drinking to excess can cause dangerous problems because alcohol lowers blood sugar and when you are \"buzzed\" you might not even realize you are low.There are lots of temptations out there, but the thing to know is you can have fun without substances. I know it must be hard to be 13 and have to always worry about diabetes, but you don't let that have to get in the way of your enjoying your life, whether it's friends, sports, learning what you are good at, or just plain having fun, you can do whatever you want to do and there is so much more out there to explore in life than drugs!",
