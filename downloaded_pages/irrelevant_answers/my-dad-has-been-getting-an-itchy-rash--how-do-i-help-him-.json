            "answer": "There are a couple different types of rashes people report on tx. I experience two such rashes. One I couldn't do much about but the other looked somewhat like a fungus type rash. I did go to my GP and get the rash scraped and it tested negative for any funguses but the doc also thought it looked peculiarly like a fungal rash so he ordered me a cortisone cream with a little antifungal included. Within 2 days that rash was gone. It did keep coming back periodically but whenever I put this ceam on it it went away. I have read about others reporting this type of rash. As for the other rash it came and went and I never really found anything that helped much. I am sure others will give you some suggestions based on their experiences. It's nice of you to be checking this out for him. LL",

            "answer": "I can only speak for me. Cool showers no soap and Aveeno Oil in the shower. And apart from the nether regions(arse and ****) only wash every couple of days. No deoderants cut hair short and dont wash it. It washes itself. Then ponder on why you have no friends but dont itch to much.S Hall",

    "question": "My father has Hep. C & diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He was taking pegasys for a while.\u00a0\u00a0Recently he's been getting this horrible rash that spreads all over his body. It comes quickly with no warning & i see it driving him crazy. His doctors gave him lotion with steroids in it. His other doctor gave him Zyrtec(allergy meds) but it makes him so sleepy that he can't function. I don't know what to do to help him. He thinks spicy foods, certain detergents or even stress cause it. I just wanted to know if anyone has gone through this and might have some information/advice that could help.Thank you",
