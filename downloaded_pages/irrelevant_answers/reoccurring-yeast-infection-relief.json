    "question": "I'm 23 and I've had a reoccurring and/or chronic yeast infection since May of last year. I'm not pregnant, I don't have diabetes, I don't wear tight fitting clothes, and I only wear cotton underwear. My OBGYN told me that this just happens to some women, that they are just inclined to get so many, but this does not seem normal to me and I'm unsatisfied with the answer. I've spend a lot of money on prescriptions, over the counter treatments, and doctor's appointments to try and fix this issue once and for all but it still keeps coming back.And now recently I thought I got another yeast infection, but this time the discharge is not only clumpy, it's light pinkish in color with brown specks in it. What is going on? What do I really have? I made an appointment with a different practice but it's not for another 3 weeks! What should I do?",
