            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.The symptoms you describe could be related to diabetes. To get an accurate diagnosis you would need to have blood drawn. Could you utilize any clinics in your area? Some pharmacies are now providing routine screenings and vaccinations. There is usually a set cost that they will discuss with you beforehand. If you do have diabetes, it is very important to treat it by keeping your blood sugar regulated as soon as possible. Elevated blood sugar can lead to permanent organ and tissue damage if left untreated. Treatment varries with type and severity of diabetes and can include diet and lifestyle changes, oral medication, and insulin.Good luck and I hope you find the medical assistance you need.Cathy",
