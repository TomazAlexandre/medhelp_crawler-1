            "answer": "Hi Okiedirt,Congratulations on coping with your diabetes so well. You are obviously careful and thoughtful about this.My 16-year-old daughter lost a lot of weight when she was first diagnosed two years ago. Secretly she was thrilled, because she became a \"skinny girl.\" But it wasn't healthy skinny. She has gradually gained weight the right way and looks great today. Exercise is her key-- she's a competitive swimmer, so the consistent exercise helped her rebuild some of the muscle mass she lost before diagnosis. If you keep up your exercise and eat the foods you like in moderate portions, you should be just fine.As for the bg, keep talking to your diabetes team; hopefully with tinkering it'll get under control.Hang in there!",

            "answer": "Hi Okiedirt,I'm a volunteer on this forum and have been diabetic for 11 years.It sure sounds like you're doing what you can to take care of yourself. If you want to gain weight the healthy way I would advise you to pair up with a nutritionist (who should be a part of your diabetes care team anyway) and ask him/her for guidance. The nutritionist will go over your dietary habits and goals and help you construct a healthy diet and excercise plan.You can also check out the American Diabetes Association's website: www.diabetes.org for more information as well as books on nutrition.As for specific advise, I would say, aside from eating more calories, which essentially will make you gain weight, try to increase the \"good fat\": the mono- and polyunsaturated fats, found in foods such as olive oil, canola oil, peanut butter, avocados, and nuts.You can also get some information on these websites:http://www.mckinley.uiuc.edu/handouts/gaining_weight/gaining_weight.htmlnutrition.about.com/od/ dietsformedicaldisorders/f/GainWeight.htmThey have some tips on healthy ways to gain weight.Good luck to you!",
