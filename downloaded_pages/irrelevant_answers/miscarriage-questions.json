            "answer": "I know plenty of women who have diabetes and have healthy babies. As for thyroid disease my SIL just had a beautiful 9lb 3oz baby girl 8wks ago. As long as your problems are under control you should definitely be able to have a healthy baby. Don't be discouraged. You can definitely try again soon. I'm sorry you are miscarrying. It must be devestating. Stay strong and keep us updated.",
