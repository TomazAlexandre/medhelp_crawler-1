    "question": "last night... I went in aroun 8 in the evening and am just now getting home. I was having alot of pain in my lower abdomen so they hooked me up to the fetal heart monitor and I wasnt having any contractions (which is good) so then they did a urine and I had proteins in my urine and it turns out I have a UTI that spread to my kidneys which turned into a kidney infection so they gave me demerol through my iv and I slept most of the night away. In the morning they sent for an ultrasound and they confirmed that im having a little girl\u00a0\u00a0which im going to name aubrey ryan :o) She was kicking and having a good ole time .. the nurses were all laughing at me cus I was loppy from the demerol... I guess I was trying to undress in the hall way lol.. I dont remember any of it though. they were a little worried about my blood pressure it was 172/105 when I went in which is horrible ... but I was in really bad pain so thats why it was so high... the ob told me if I can survive a kidney stone that labor is a breeze.. lol :o)",
