That contain Manitol, sorbitol. Anything in that category.\u00a0\u00a0 sorbitol an d manitol are the main ingredients in ex lax and are used in most sugar free foods.\u00a0\u00a0 They can cause the runs, loose stools and stomach aches.\u00a0\u00a0The only thing that our daughter has now that is \u201csugar fee or diet is soda. Other wise it is the regular foods would also suggest you have her tested for celiac.The other thing we did is checked her blood every 15 min or swo afterwards to see if she was going high or low\u00a0\u00a0rapidly.

            "answer": "You do not mention wheat or wheat gluten, Type 1 diabetics are at high risk for Celiac disease, where the body responds to gluten by attacking hte cilia in the upper intestine. This can cause signifcant intestinal pain, among many other symptoms (or no symptoms at all). It is another autoimmune disease (nor an allergy), and there is a blood test to determine if marker antibodies are present. If you have your child tested, do not elimiate wheat first, as the test may be inconclusive.Fortunately, if this disease is present, the damage and symproms will resolve with a gluten free diet.Larry",

    "question": "My daughter is 6 yrs old with type one diabetes,dxd at age 4 and for the last year she has been complaining of a tummy ache. She has had blood test done but nothing has been found. I have tried taking away dairy, and fruit. She has no keatones. It is not when she is high or low. I have found no patterns. She feels so bad all of the time.The teachers at school are calling me constantly for what to do for her and I do not know what to tell them. When Natalie cry's and tells me her tummy hurts I don't know what to do for her. Does any one have any suggestions as to what this can be? Her doctor, I think does not take it seriously. But I am so worried. She is so young and to have to suffer with diabetes much less a tummy ache is too much for her. Please any suggestions or experience's would be greatly apprciated. I am out of ideas. Rachael",
