            "answer": "Hi,Lower back pain of the type you have mentioned may be due to a kidney stone or some problem with the lower spine. Did you have any accident or trauma involving the lower back ? In any case, you need to get a detailed diagnosis to find out the source of your problem. ED can be caused due to any injury to the nerves or\u00a0\u00a0any problem with the blood flow to the penis. Both systems of blood vessels and nerves to the penis are connected to the lower back area of our body.Better late than never, do consult a physician first and get it properly diagnosed.Do not attempt any treatment without knowing the source of the problem.Good luck,Solace",

    "question": "I had ED suddenly in November 2013 (writing this in June 2014). Since then morning erections have also gradually gone down to almost none or very weak. The size of the penis has also shrunk. I've recently read about Peyronie's disease. Though there's no curve, and no hourglass shape when erect. When flaccid, very rarely the hourglass shape is slightly visible.In September'13, I had an excruciating lower back pain which led to sciatica like pain in the buttocks and down, and it troubled me for quite some time -- at the moment it's relieved because i have been taking some homeopathic medicine since last 3 months. Can there be a connection of the back pain and ED?We have no history of diabetes, heart trouble in the family on both maternal and paternal sides. I'm 35 right now, 5'8'', and weigh about 73kg. I was once married and had a daughter but now divorced since 6 years.Will really appreciate any help. Thanks",
