    "question": "I have a concern about a non-healing wound that my mother has.\u00a0\u00a0 She is 75 yrs. old, very active, and in good health.\u00a0\u00a0Five months ago she cut her leg shaving and it has yet to heal.\u00a0\u00a0She never told me until 2 months after the cut because she was in a lot of pain.\u00a0\u00a0I took her right to the dr. and we were sent to a wound specialist.\u00a0\u00a0They did a culture and got her on antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0She has been going there for treatment every week for 3 months and it's not healed.\u00a0\u00a0She has terrible pain and can't sleep most nights.\u00a0\u00a0Even the sheets hitting her leg is too much to take.\u00a0\u00a0She was negative for diabetes and she had vascular tests done that were all normal.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor now wants her to have a biopsy done.\u00a0\u00a0Are they thinking skin cancer?\u00a0\u00a0Even from a little cut from a razor?\u00a0\u00a0She' never been a sun worshipper.I'm worried.Thank you for any information.",
