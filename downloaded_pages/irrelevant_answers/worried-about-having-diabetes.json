            "answer": "Being a diabetic for the past 7 years and a the daughter of a juvenile diabetic, I can tell you that a fasting sugar should be between 70 and 100 give or take a point here and there.\u00a0\u00a0So I'm guessing your doctors are thinking 104 isn't bad and to be honest it isn't.I would go with what the doctors said and randomly check your glucose levels periodically at home.\u00a0\u00a0You can get a montior at the store.Fasting should be 70 to 100 give or take a few2 hours after eating should be under 150.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "At 104 fasting, I would say no, but then I'm not a doctor either. It is, however, time to start watching and monitoring your sugar and carb sugar intake, if at all, reduce them when possible. Don't ignore the fact that you're close because once you tip the scale there's no turning back. Oh yeah, just a little bit, or just this one time won't hurt, it does hurt. Push that desert away, just say no.",

    "question": "To introduce myself, I am a 21yr old female. 5\"7, 118lbs. Only fam hx of diabetes is a grandpa on one side and a great uncle on the other.Back in December I had a glucose reading (random) come back at 134. BUT, this was only an hour or so after eating a huge meal of pizza and pop. So the doc had me come back for a fasting. It was 104. So am I pre-diabetic? He was not concerned, and I have since seen two docs and asked them and they said I am not either. Everything I read and see on the internet tells me that I am \"high\" and am pre-diabetic.So I'm having some weird symptoms. Fatigue and a dry mouth. But I started Cymbalta for anziety and I have noticed those two started after I started that. I also get floaters. I don't really have many of the symptoms of diabetes. But I cannot stop worrying, that is my problem.Should I listen to the 3 docs I've seen and get over it, or get another opinion? Is 104 something to worry about? THANKS!",
