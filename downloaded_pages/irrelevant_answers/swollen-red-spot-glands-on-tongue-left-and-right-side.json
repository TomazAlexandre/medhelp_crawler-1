            "answer": "Hi,To me it seems like Geographic tongue(benign migratory glossitis).Geographic tongue is characterised by irregularly shaped red, map-like smooth swollen patches on the tongue. A white border sometimes surrounds them. It is also known as benign migratory glossitis because the appearance is constantly changing. Although geographic tongue is benign (harmless) it may persist for months or longer, and often recurs. Often there are no symptoms but burning or irritation of the tongue is common, particularly with hot or spicy foods.Lesions are usually confined to the tongue but they sometimes arise elsewhere in the mouth or on the lips.The exact cause is unknown but the following factors have been linked with the condition:It occurs more commonly in patients with psoriasis, especially pustular psoriasisThere are also associations with diabetes, anaemia, atopy (asthma and/or eczema) and stressIn some patients particular foods seem to be a trigger, especially cheeseClustering within a family suggests genetic involvementGeographic tongue is a benign condition that usually resolves itself without causing any problems for the patient so most people do not require treatment. There is no known cure. If there are associated medical conditions, treatment of these may improve the appearance of the tongue.Discomfort may be treated with a mouth gargle or rinse containing antiseptic and anaesthetic agents. Topical corticosteroids may also be helpful for occasional use eg. triamcinolone in dental paste applied several times a day when required.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted.",
