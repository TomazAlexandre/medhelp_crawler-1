            "answer": "Yeah, if there was a way to skip them (w/d's) life would be no fun. Lol! I just worry too much. I went one night without and wanted to die. So I'm hoping to keep the RLS I already have for several years now to a minimum. That's the thing that drives me crazy the most.",

            "answer": "Hi there. I was on tramadol for 7 yrs and I just decided to go cold turkey. I won't kid you by saying coming off this stuff is easy, but I've been off them now for 50 days and feeling better. I'm still suffering mood swings which can still be bad, but the physical symptoms have stopped. It's different for everyone, just take one day at a time. Just keep thinking how well you've done so far and how much better you'll feel for getting off them. Be proud of yourself for every day you get through, this stuff is not easy to get out of your system. I'm always here if you need a bit of support.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the honest answer. I already have mood swings, so I can deal with those. I have been dx as rapid cycling bipolar disorder. I have diabetes, neuropathy in my legs and RLS on a normal day.So i'm just really scared of the physical pain w/ds cause. I know it's silly, with everything I have going on with me normally.",
