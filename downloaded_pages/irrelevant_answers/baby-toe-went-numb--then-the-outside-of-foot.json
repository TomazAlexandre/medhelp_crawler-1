            "answer": "Hello.Your numbness seems to be a neuropathic manifestation. And since there is a history of tingling on the same foot, I would get an MRI of the lumbar spine. I guess thet MRI that you did 4 years ago was an MRI of the lumbar spine.Another concern is Diabetes. Have you been assessed for blood sugar levels?Regards",

    "question": "hello, about a month ago, the baby toe on my right foot, started to like bother me, not painful, just 'weird',\u00a0\u00a0i just checked it to make sure it looked okay. then 2 days later, i noticed it felt numb. then a week later the top outside of the same foot went numb, then 4 days later a i had what was like something crawling under the skin on the bottom of the same foot. i started to get worried (finally). i went to see the acupuncture doctor since my family doctor couldnt see me for a week. after 2 treatments of acupuncture, the crawely feeling went away. when i did get in to see the family doc, he put me on prednisone for 2 weeks. during the\u00a0\u00a06 acupuncture treatments and having finished the prednisone,\u00a0\u00a0the toe and side got a smidge better, then worse and then better. i can still move them, it's just like someone gave my a local aneasthesia.4 years ago, my right calf and foot (yes, the same one), went tingley for like 2 monthes. i had an mri, nothing showed up. i took 3 acupunture treatments. i am like 35 pounds overweight (i gained when i quit smoking 8 years ago). i've had arthoscope surgery twice on my right knee for meniscus tears, and i was diagnosed with scolisis when a teenger, went to clinics for montoring 3 years, docs said i didnt need any treatment. otherwise, i'm healthy.my questions: has anyone else had this?\u00a0\u00a0any ideas on what is it? will it go away by itself? (i dont have the best health insurance and am trying to make an imformed chocie before the doc order a bunch of test insurance wont cover)thank you",
