    "question": "My wife is 54 and was diagnosed with asthma 8 years ago. Besides her regular pulmonologist, she has seen three other specialists, including a visit to National Jewish in 1998. She has been taking both oral and IV corticosteroids daily since the beginning, and she averages a hospital admission every two weeks; every week since early Dec. Her doctor's term for her condition is \"severe end stage asthma with marked steroid insensitivity.\" She had also been on a course of methotrexate for over a year that produced no significant benefit. She has extreme side effects from high steroid use. Without going into a lot of details about her case, I would like to know if there have been any studies of patients with similar asthma problems where the only treatment seems to be high doses of corticosteroids and nebs to relieve the asthma exacerbations.",
