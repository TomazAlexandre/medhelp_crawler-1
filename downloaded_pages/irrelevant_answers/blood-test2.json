            "answer": "HiFuture no one can speak about for sure. However if a particular set of lab investigations are within normal limits today, there is no reason why they will not continue to be so tomorrow or in future. However if it is related to some disease, then there can be fluctuations depending on the control of the disease like diabetes, hypothyroidism etc.Until and unless you have symptoms one should be concerned about, do not worry. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
