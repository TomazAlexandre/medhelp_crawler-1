            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!You should look at diabetes and hypothyroidism. Along with this there is a chance there is GERD. This can cause burning sensation on tongue, throat etc.Anxiety can exacerbate the situation for many sufferers. A common complaint of patients is that they get nervous because they sweat, then sweat more because they are nervous. Other factors can play a role; certain foods & drinks, nicotine, caffeine, and smells can trigger a response (see also diaphoresis).\u201d\u00a0\u00a0Refer: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperhidrosis#CauseEndocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism and glucose control disorders all result in increased sweating. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating.

Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I have not been feeling right for about two years around the time my daughter was born.\u00a0\u00a0I had tingling in my head and tongue and sharp pains in my head so my GP referred me to a nuerologist who ran some tests but everything came out normal.\u00a0\u00a0Then I was feeling run down like I was on the verge of getting a cold but never got sick and eventually went back to GP thinking I was anemic or something since I am a vegetarian.\u00a0\u00a0The GP did some blood tests and referred me to a hematologist/oncologist due to platelets being slightly low and lymph count slightly high.\u00a0\u00a0He did some tests including a horrible bone marrow biopsy and again everything was normal.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am still having all of the above but in addition I have been having stomach cramps and twitching in stomach, lower back pain and nausea.\u00a0\u00a0I am tired of wasting time and money at the DR to be told everything is fine when I know something is wrong.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to know what it is so I can fix it and move on.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has any clue what this could be please let me know, I am getting very desperate!\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!It is difficult to comment really without examination. However diabetes mellitus is a likely cause for head and tongue tingling. It could also be due to nerve compression very high up in the cervical vertebra, causing headaches along with tingling. Benign intracranial hypertension is another possibility. Excess alcohol intake, partial seizures and low calcium levels all cause head and tongue tingling. Severe acidity too can cause stomach cramps and nausea. However since you also have low back ache, it could also be an irritable bowel.\u00a0\u00a0The enumerated the possibilities can be investigated or ruled out one by one by your physician.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!Ok! I went through the whole post again. There is something that I recall about a patient which is similar to your history since you had a surgery at C6-7 level. You also mention a lump on the right side of your spine.These parasympathetic innervations in the areas you have burning sensation occur through a synapse at C8-T1 level of the cervical cord. I think there is some problem at the level of \u2018ciliospinal center of Budge-Waller at the C8-T1\u2019 in your spinal cord. Do consult a neurologist to rule out a cervical cord pathology. You would need a highly experienced neurologist for this. It\u2019s just a thought, may be farfetched but there is no harm in talking to your neurologist about this.Hope this helps. Do discuss this possibility with your neurologist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
