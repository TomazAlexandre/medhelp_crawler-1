            "answer": "Hi there!I can't answer all of your questions, but I can speak about my experience with NASH and pregnancy.I was diagnosed with NASH about 4-5 years ago. I had very high liver enzyme levels and sent to a GE, who ordered an ultrasound and was diagnosed. He said it wasn't so bad that we'd do a biopsy, but we'd watch it (annual bloodwork) and if my levels got higher, we'd do a biospy and take it from there.About 2-3 years later my husband and I wanted to start a family (my annual bloodwork always showed the same elevated levels up until this point, they'd not gotten better or worse). I checked with both my OB and GE about it, and they both said NASH should not affect my pregnancy.I had my first round of bloodwork at 8 weeks pregnant and MIRACULOUSLY my liver enzyme levels were now well within normal. They'd literally gone from 2-3x higher than normal to the low-end of normal.All anyone could do was shake their head. There was really no explanation... other than pregnancy does amazing things to your body.At the same visit, I was also diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which my OB actually thought was Type 2, undiagnosed (i.e. I'd had it prior to my pregnancy).I ended up losing weight through most of my pregnancy, thanks to a strict diet, exercise, and insulin.That's the only thing I'd caution you on, since I have a feeling that NASH and diabetes go hand in hand... I'd ask for an early glucose tolerance test. Early diagnosis is the key to baby's safety.After I had my daughter in April 2009, I ended up about 30 pounds lighter, and have kept it off.My last round of bloodwork was in November 2009, and my liver enzyme levels still show NORMAL.I'm not sure if the pregnancy just shocked my liver into normalcy and it stayed there, or if the weight loss is keeping it at bay. No one can really answer that.So, my story of NASH and pregnancy is a successful one. I hope yours is, too!!~Brenda",

    "question": "I am 35, T2 diabetes and overweight. Was just dx with NASH. I am taking Vit E, Vit C and Milk thistle in addition to diet and exercise. Are there any other ways to prevent progression of disease? Is it possible to \"reverse\" or change to just NAFLD? What is life expectancy of someone with NASH? I also was hopeful before dx to have another child- would pregnancy affect NASH? Are there any good forum/support websites for someone with NASH or NAFLD?",
