    "question": "Hello. My mother if about 50 yrs old. She is a heart patient with 3 stents, has diabetes, and asthma problems. During a routine liver blood test she found that her gamma gt was very high. She had a ct scan and mrcp. They found a cyst on the head of the pancreas. They think it is benign but a biopsy has not been done as sometimes it is false negative. 8 months later she has had an endoscopy done and the size of the cyst remains the same. The endoscopy report reads :Echoendosonographically using 7.5mhz area of concerned is visualized. There is a 4.2 x 3.7 cystic lesion of the pancreatic head. The cysts are very small in size measuring a few milolimeters in some places and smaller in others. No large cyst(>1cm) appreciated. A discrete solid component is not seem to be associated with the lesion. I cannot see the stellate scar associated with serous cystadenomas. The pancreatic duct is not involved and the neck, body, and tail of the Pancreas are normal. The bilary system is dialated in the extra hepatic region. Intra hepatic ducts seem normal. The cbd measure about 1.2cm in size and is being compressed by the mass lession in the pancreatic head. No lyphyadepathy is noted.Now I have 2 questions, shoud this be perated on or not due to my mothers others diseases, it makes it a high risk op. Second as we live in Pakistan, please let me know where the best place or doctor in the States is for a checkup or surgery. Thank you very very much.",
