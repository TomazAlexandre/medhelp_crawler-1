    "question": "I found a log today of blood pressure readings of a friend of mine. He is 45 years old, Morbidly obese (bmi 35)To save space Im going to provide the mean numbers because it looks like he is charting several times per day...This week, 164.5/122.8Month, 164.53/113.97Year (starting Jan 2009) 164.85/112.01Things I can say for a fact, he has no medical insurance and would not go to a dr. He eats like ****, daily. He has mentioned nosebleeds lately (not excessive but more than none, which he had before) He is complaining about heartburn, He is complaining about urinating in the nighttime, headaches seem to be more frequent, he is taking a ton of tylenol for aches and pains. He is a construction worker so it is a very physical job, he is never sitting. He has also been complaining of the TV or computer being dark, (I dont think so).\u00a0\u00a0He is not sleeping well, complains of waking several times per night and is a heavy snorer, Is exhausted during the day.\u00a0\u00a0I believe if the symptoms where serious enough he would see a Dr, but\u00a0\u00a0the symptoms by themselves are enough.What is the outlook? What can I do? What stage is he at?",
