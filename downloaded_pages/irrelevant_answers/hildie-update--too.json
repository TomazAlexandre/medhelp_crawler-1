            "answer": "I'm sorry about the loss of Chessie.Have you put Hildie on a grain and carb free diet? I have heard diabetes can be reversed in cats if you put them on a no carb diet. Since my own D diagnosis I have put my cats on grain free diets.. Wiz is mostly on rad cat now although Sybil unfortunately refuses to eat it most of the time so she gets grain free.She is so cute btw, I love torties, my Angie who passed the September before last was a tortie <3",

            "answer": "We have been slowly, so as not to upset their senior systems, switching their food away from grains as much as possible.Their kibble is now half and half Friskies Indoor and Blue Buffalo Chicken.\u00a0\u00a0I also have them mostly switched to pate or minced meat wet food, with the gravy style as an occasional treat.Miss Teia, who did not know how to eat wet food when she came to use 4 3/4 years ago, now eats mostly wet food.\u00a0\u00a0Hildie eats about half and half wet and kibble.",

    "question": "Heya;Hildie is doing well, insulin is down to 2 1/4 units of insulin twice a day from the original 3 units twice a day.She spends about half the day upstairs and comes to bed most nights now since Chessie went over the Rainbow.She was just walking away from having a snack from Teia's bowl in the kitchen last night (which is why the icture's a little out of focus).Tonight, for the first time since we moved, Hildie and Teia took supper together in the kitchen.",
