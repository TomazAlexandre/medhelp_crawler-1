            "answer": "Hi!Yes, you appear to be having problems which should be seriously looked into.Oily stool that floats is medically called steatorrhea. Pancreatitis and cholangitis are the main cause. Other possibilities are inflammatory bowel conditions such as Crohn\u2019s, celiac, IBS etc. It can be side effects of slimming pills. Bacterial overgrowth and short bowel syndrome where food passes very quickly can be another cause.Patients with chronic pancreatitis have recurrent abdominal pain of varying intensity along with steatorrhea or oily foul smelling stool. Pancreatic enzymes (amylase and lipase) are often normal. Common tests used for diagnosis are fecal elastase in stool, serum trypsinogen, CT scan and ultrasounds (which often come back normal), MRI, ERCP and MRCP (all of which are more conclusive). Usually after chronic pancreatitis patients develop insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and this should be ruled out by fasting blood glucose, post prandial blood glucose and glycosylated hemoglobin (a test which gives last 3 months control over blood glucose). Diabetes often causes rapid weight loss.Crohn\u2019s disease is a difficult entity to diagnose and can cause weight loss. Along with gut symptoms skin disorders and arthritis too are commonly seen with Crohn\u2019s. An upper GI series using barium dye is done to see the condition of small intestines. The degree of involvement of the large and small intestine may vary from person to person.\u00a0\u00a0A biopsy is the most confirmatory. An elevated ESR, low protein, minerals and iron in blood are the other findings in Crohn\u2019s which may or may not be present. A recent advancement in Crohn\u2019s diagnosis is video capsule endoscopy.Gluten is a complex protein present in four main grains---wheat, rye, barley and oats. If you have gluten intolerance, then you probably have celiac disease or Non Celiac gluten sensitivity. There are blood tests called celiac test to detect gluten intolerance.Diagnosis of IBS is through elimination of other inflammatory bowel causes.There are many other causes of unexplained weight loss like worms in stool, depression, anorexia nervosa, AIDS, cancers especially colon cancers (ruled out as you had a colonoscopy in 2012), drug abuse, infections and loss of appetite.Please discuss with your doctor. The above mentioned tests should be done.I sincerely hope you will find this information useful in your journey towards better health.Hope you get well soon! Good Luck and take care!",

    "question": "[CONTINUE FROM MY PREVIOUS POSTING]My next concern is my body weight lost. I have studied a lot articles regarding sudden weight lost etc, it may due to pancreases cancer, colon disease. I even not dare to stand up on the weighting machine for 3 months until now. I have visited a hypnosis consultant during Mar\u2013May 2013, because this anxiety caused me cannot sleep well, and wake up few times in a night and get dreaming for every night. It helped but I stopped the treatment until now.Besides, now I am very concern on my stool. I have studied about floating stools thru\u2019 magazine and websites, and these may due to gassy food or pancreases disease. I have noticed that my stool was mostly floated at all time, smell different from usual and loose (not solid if compares with those days). It may sink for some time but float for most of the time. These started since Jan 2013, and it caused my thinking back what the Chinese Medicine doctor told me before that probably due to pancreases problem.\u00a0\u00a0I am thinking to tell these to my gastroenterology, but I am wondering as well whether is due to my anxiety or due to something serious (ills) really happens to me already.",
