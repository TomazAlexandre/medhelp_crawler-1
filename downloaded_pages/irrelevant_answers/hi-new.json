            "answer": "Your A1c verified your fasting level of 124 mg/dl, right at the borderline for diabetes [126 mg/dl]. The 3 month follow up testing will be another A1c as the A1c looks back at your blood sugars for the past 3 months. You want it <5% although some doctors accept up to 5.7%.Your BMI is 24.4 at the upper range of normal. At 160 lbs your BMI would be 21.7, smack dab in the middle of normal [18.5 - 24.9]. Shedding a few pounds will help lower your blood sugars. And then....\"I have cut way back on sugar and carbs. Any advise?\"This is kind of a general statement as you didn't mention how much you cut back. It is, however, a very good start. First step is to eliminate sugar completely from your diet. Instead, use alternative sweeteners like Splenda or Stevia. Next is cutting way back on carbs. Use Google to understand the difference between simple and complex carbs. The latter is good for you. You do need some carbs in your body for energy. So pay attention to portion sizes. If you go too low on carbs your skin will start to stink like ammonia so watch this carefully. The last key is exercise. Exercise helps burn off excess sugar. You want to do 30-60 minutes of exercise daily or at least 5 times a week. Walking at a good pace really burns off excesssugars. Good luck -Last and foremost is your home glucose [blood sugar] test meter. If you don't have they are available at Walgreens or Wal*Mart for under $15. Carefully read the instructions, the do's and don'ts. You want to test at1.] Fasting, first thing in morning b4 eating or drinking any colored liquids.2.] Preprandial, b4 a meal for a baseline measurement3.] Postprandial, 2-3 hrs after a meal. Compare against preprandial results. This will tell how the foods you ate affected your blood sugars. Avoid those that do.",

This thing has come up during this year that we sold our home and moved into a smaller less physical home. Why I don't know. Anyway I swim 5 days a week and have gone from 186lbs to 180lbs.I look at the sugar content of everything. We are buying sugar free stuff and most of it is good.I am eating more fruit [guess that is good] and salads now. Back to eating steaks once a week and things like that.I will read up on the good and bad carbs thanks for that.I think this happened because for some reason we got into eating pies,chips and all that stuff so I'm hoping if I get back to myself and pick up my exercise thing will return to normal.Thanks again",

            "answer": "\"I look at the sugar content of everything.\"When reading nutrition labels pay close attention to sugars listed under carbohydrates. They list the amount as grams. Kinda misleading as folks don't realize every 7 grams equals one heaping tablespoon of refined sugar. For example, one 8 oz glass of dairy milk may contain upwards of 12 grams of sugar. That alone will light you up.Fruit contains fructose, fruit sugar. Eat fruits with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose. Avoid tropical fruits like pineapple, guava, mangoes, etc as these have high fructose levels. Melons and berries are low on the list. And, no dried fruits like apricots or raisins.I use this web site often to see nutritional values on foods. It provides an in-depth look beyond what labels provide and has become an invaluable tool.\u00a0\u00a0 http://nutritiondata.self.com/I feel your doctor's experience was a wake-up call. You know what you need to do so keep up the good work.Remember to test, test, test. Good luck -",

That is enough to turn me away. Look for \"Sugar Free\" products.Sugar alcohols are usually used with an artificial sweetener to enhance sweetness of foods. Consumption of sugar alcohols does affect blood sugar levels, but in small amounts does little to elevate blood sugars mainly due to them not being digestible. That being said, as with most nondigestible food sources, sugar alcohols may also cause bloating and diarrhea when consumed in excessive amount. This amount may vary by each person. HTH",

            "answer": "\"When is the best time to check it? As I said I am not diabetic so I don't want to go nuts on checking it.\"Fasting 102 mg/dl is considered prediabetes but just a tad bit above normal.Until you reign in the reason for your elevated blood sugars one should test at the following times:Fasting - first thing in morning b4 eating or drinking colored liquids. Plain water is OK. Provides an insight whether your liver is dumping excess glycogen.Preprandial - B4 meals. This provides an baseline measurement to compare against postprandial. You want to be at normal levels - 60/70 to 99 mg/dl.Postprandial - 2-3 hrs after a meal. Compare against preprandial. If your blood sugars are elevated the foods you ate are the problem source.Bedtime - Do not eat or drink colored liquids 2-3 hrs b4 bedtime. You do not want to go to sleep with high levels. If you do it means you are spending 1/3 of your day with above normal levels.As time progresses you will get better control and learn how to manage your blood sugars. Testing will decrease, some eliminated altogether.An A1c of 6% equates to a daily blood sugar level of 125 mg/dl, prediabetes. Diabetes starts at 6.01% or 126 mg/dl. Because of age factors doctors may allow up to 5.7 and even 6%. Discuss values when you see him next. My doc allows email for updates and basic questions - eliminates doctors office payments.Did you know you can purchase an A1c test meter OTC?",
