            "answer": "Hello,The burning sensation in the genital area can be due to fungal infection but the burning sensation in the whole body can be due to parasthesia skin. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition. Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not. In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your time. My family doctor did a blood test and found vitamin B levels to be low. Im now on 2000 units per day of straight B vitamins. He also recommended Claratin to stop the electric feeling of the nerves. First few days on the Claratin stopped the electric nerves. He looked at my skin on my back which showed to be red blotchy spots. Thats also gone now. My alcohol intake is occassional ( wine with dinner) is the extent of my drinking. The burning crotch still occurs occassionaly but nothing like it was. It almost seems to be sweat related, as the day goes on. I have a topical ointment prescribed by my dermo doc.( Econazole Nitrate) that seems to do wonders for the situation. Any other suggestions are well appriciated. :)",

    "question": "Ive had this issue for sevreral months now. The area between my testicles and leg burns excessivly. (area where tighty whiteys would sit) Tried a hydrocortizone cream recommended by Dermo Dr. worked for 1 week then all hell broke loose. Burning got worse. The burning itching got so bad the nerves in my legs and butt felt like electricity. I told my GP about this and he recommended Claratin which has cooled things down. Still getting flare ups. Ive switched my underware from tighty whiteys to boxers but still have sensitivity to anywhere the material touches. The areas involved are also very sweaty. And the flare ups seem worse in the morning and seem to taper off as the day goes on. Im most comfortable in just pajamas but going to work like that isnt possible. Ive read other things on line of this thing call Prostatitis and some of the symptoms seem compatible with what I have, I could really!! use some help this is getting real old. Dealing with this disorder. Thank You for your time.",
