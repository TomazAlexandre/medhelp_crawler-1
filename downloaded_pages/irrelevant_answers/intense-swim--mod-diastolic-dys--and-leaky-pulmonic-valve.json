            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Exercise will worsen any cardiac symptom, as it increases the workload on the heart. So, please build up your exercise level slowly and do not overstrain. Also, check out your ejection fraction, this could be an important indicator of your exercise capacity. The ejection fraction is a useful measure of left ventricular performance. The normal range is 63-77% for males and 55-75% for females. It reflects the pumping capacity of the heart. Please discuss this with your consulting doctor, he may guide you as per the exercise protocol.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Your ejection fraction is on the lower side and it is not normal to take this long to recover from a workout. An angiogram may help to check for coronary circulation. Certain systemic disorders like anemia, diabetes, vitamin deficiencies and thyroid disorders can cause these symptoms. Check with your doctor to rule out these conditions.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "hello, i've had open heart surgery to repair the pulmonic valve (stenosis), as a child. i've been seen by doctors who tell me it is ok to exercise, even though i have a mild leaky pulmonary valve, and moderate diastolic dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0it seems to take the entire day to recover after my swim (masters swim program), and my breathing is quite rapid all day long.\u00a0\u00a0could exercise worsen those conditions?\u00a0\u00a0please help - if anyone experiences these symptoms.",
