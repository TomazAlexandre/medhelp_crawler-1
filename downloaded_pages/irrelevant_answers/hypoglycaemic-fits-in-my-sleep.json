            "answer": "Your symptoms sound more like very severe hypoglycemia to me, but the results of your lab tests will be the real answer. Your numbers there after a meal sound pretty normal. You may want to check out the information on a website for people who suffer from hypoglycemia: www.hypoglycemia.org. There is a question and answer test you can take to see if you fit the classic symptoms and also good information about dietary changes that you may need to make to help keep this under control. But, no, these are not symptoms of diabetes.",

            "answer": "Your blood glucose reading at the doctor's of 7.7 (138 in the U.S. scale) taken at 45 minutes after lunch is not necessarily ok. Many of us don't reach our peak post prandial until 2 hours after eating in which case you could have peaked at significantly higher which is NOT normal for a non-diabetic. Mysteria's answer is the classic experience of a Type 1 but not of a Type 2. Type 2's in fact can have little or no symptoms and be diabetic.You may suffer from hypoglycemia alone or you may be pre-diabetic or diabetic. Only your doctor can tell you for sure. It sounds like in the next week he is going to do either an A1C which tests for your average blood sugar in a 2-3 month period or an OGTT which means drinking a high sugar liquid and testing your response over a couple hours. At any rate his comment that severe hypoglycemic reactions are common in women your age is absolute nonsense!",

    "question": "I hope you can help, I have not been diagnosed with this condition but I will be tested for Diabetes within the next week.I have been the Doctors before because I shake when I need to eat and if I keep getting a shaking sensation and will need to have a suagary drink straight away and then I stop shaking. The Doctor explained that this was common with women my age (25) and it was nothing to worry about but now I keep have re-occuring episodes were I will wake up in the middle of the night and I will be soaked with sweat and shaking and needing to have something sugary straight away. It leaves me feeling confused, concerned and feeling really groggy for the rest of the day.I ate my breakfast this morning at 09:15 and I went to my Doctor's appointment at 10:00 and she tested my bllod sugar level and it was 7.7, I don't know if that is good or not. She also did a urine check and it was clear from sugar.My Mum also suffers with the shaking and with the sweating but she has never been to the Doctor's to have it checked out.In your opinion does this sound like Diabetes?.Thanks for you time.Kerry",
