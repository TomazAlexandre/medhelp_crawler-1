            "answer": "Try different types and consistencies of litter in several boxes all in different areas of the house, cats can be very particular of the type and scent vs non scented litter also the location. If there is nothing medically wrong ( are you sure did the Vet do a urine and test her PH?) than its due to her not being pleased with something. Also try her on a strictly canned food diet, dry food does raise the Ph and causes bladder crystals that are very painful, making cats associate this pain with their litter boxes, canned food that has a high moisture content is the only thing that will help!!!!Also wash everything she has peed on with an enzyme cleaner, anything else only removes the odor for us but cats can still detect the scent.Did the Vet also do a diabetes test??? This too will cause some cats to pee inappropriatelyGood luck, let us know ok",

            "answer": "Hi Hdja,Firstly --how old is you cat?Where did you get her from?As Opus asked--has she been tested for Diabetes?Has she had a full blood work-up and a urinalysis?How does one test \"emotionally\"??Only after a full blood work-up and urinalysis would I be satisfied with \"a Clean bill of health\"If these tests were not done I strongly suggest you make sure they are before you call this \"selective peeing\".There IS ALWAYS a reason a cat is calling your attention to her by PEEING where you can't help but notice it or smell it--It is their way of calling for HELP!So please take her to another vet if need be, change her litter, if she is elderly make sure the litter box is not too high that she can climb into it, and humans can never tell what will stress a cat out--they have to tell you and you have to figure it out. Ha! My cat does nothing but sleep, play and eat yet she gets a Herpes breakout every so often from stress---my husband wonders how she can be stressed, but he is!!!Keep searching you will find what she wants you to find.Sorry--that is how cats work it. LOL!CML",

    "question": "We recently got a new cat, and witjin the first few days she was here, she squatted and peed on a quilt on a bed. She's since learned that beds are for sleeping, and hasn't peed again on them but instead started peeing on dirty laundry. I figured that was better than clean laundry, which for the sake of my work as a massage therapsit is good. I tried to be more on top of keeping laundry off the floor, but within the past few days she's started peeing on my clean laundry for work, even if it's put up out of the way on top of the washer or dryer. She's going out of her way to pee on it!I'm at my limit! We've taken her to the vet and have been given a full bill of health, emotionally and chemically. She has no other stresses in the home and there's no way I'm going to put my laundry on top of the fridge just to keep it from her!I don't know what else to do!",
