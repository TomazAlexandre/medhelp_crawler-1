            "answer": "Hi! What do you mean caused by antibodies? Type 1 happens when the body's pancreas stops producing insulin completely. That's why we are on insulin injections/pump. Did your 10 yr old have 2 blood sugar fastings and an A1C test to tell whether she is a diabetic? The blood tests too can tell you if their pancreas is producing any insulin or not. In my time, I was diagnosed because it ran on my mom's side. This still holds true. Hereditary, t-1. I hope she doesn't have it. We do and can live normal lives. We just have to take a little better care of ourselves and are better for doing so. I am a t-1 for 49 yrs now. My A1C (tells how one is doing for the past 3 months) is 6.5 Take care.",
