    "question": "Two months ago, I was dx'ed with autonomic small and large fiber neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I have a laundry list of symptoms that go with that dx.Yesterday, I was dx'ed with diabetes with a fasting number of 150 and he told me that I could not tolerate the test drinking the sugar solution, whatever that means.\u00a0\u00a0It is hard to believe that I can have such severe autonomic symptoms (disabling) with such a low number.\u00a0\u00a0Is anyone else confined to bed, for the most part, with autonomic symptoms, due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I will see the endocrinologist today to confirm dx.If anyone is in the same boat as me, do you also have severe lower back pain.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I hear it is associated, and other times I hear it is not.\u00a0\u00a0 The horrible back pain, starts the symptom change of events when I stand or sit too long.\u00a0\u00a0At this point, I am now waking up with it.Thank you for your help-Cathy",
