            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Are there other symptoms present? Aside from pressure on a nerve, there are many possible causes of numbness in the face or leg such as nerve injury, medication side effect, pressure on peripheral nerves from enlarged blood vessels, tumors, scar tissue, or infection, lack of blood supply to an area and medical conditions such as diabetes, migraines, transient ischemic attack (TIA), stroke, underactive thyroid, vitamin deficiency and abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body. For proper diagnosis, it is best that you have this checked by your doctor for evaluation. Complete neurological examination and additional diagnostic tests may also be done. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "I have a back and neck pain wherein c5-c6 and l4-l5 IV disc space is reduced. However through continuous exercise its under control and i even play sport on weekends (age 38 yrs). I sleep without a pillow and if i use one i have temporary numbness on one side of body and hence avoid using one. I have a desk job.Of late i have started having numbness on my face, arms and calves which keeps coming and going.\u00a0\u00a0I can feel things on my hand and face though it gets irritating with the heaviness.My movements and all are ok and no extraordinary pain.My question is whether this is a case of pinced nerve and if yes how long will it take for it to heal. Do i have to live with it as in it will come and go. Please advice.",
