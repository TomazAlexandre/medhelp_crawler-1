            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you have a lump in your neck rule out abnormal thyroid state as a cause of your fainting. It could also be hypoglycemia. It could also be postural hypotension, syncopal attack, anemia, diabetes, inner ear problems. You should get a endocrine specialist to look at the function of your endocrine glands and rule out anemia.Hope this helps. Take care!",
