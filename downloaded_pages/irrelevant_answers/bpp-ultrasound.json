    "question": "35w3d today and went in to check on fluid, growth, and placental sufficiency because of my gestational diabetes. I know fluid estimates aren't really accurate but that looked perfectly normal at about 24cm, and I know for sure that weight estimates are basically wild guesses but it didn't make me any less terrified when she told me that with more than four weeks left to go, baby looks to be about 7lbs 14oz.WHAT?!?SCARY!!I delivered my son med-free at 40w1d and he weighed 9lbs even... but seriously, man. Give me a break!Anyone else planning on giving birth to The Hulk?",
