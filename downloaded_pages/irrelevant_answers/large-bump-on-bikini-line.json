            "answer": "Hi!Post shaving, this could be an infection of a hair follicle or boil. You can treat this by applying a warm cloth to the area twice or thrice a day alternating with antibacterial cream. This encourages the pus to come to the surface, make a mouth and drain. Once the boil has drained, the area should be washed with antibacterial soap and an antibacterial cream applied and kept dry, bandaged and sterile.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you have any medical problems like diabetes, please consult a doctor, and do not wait for it to heal. Also if the boil appears to spread, the area around it becomes progressively red, the also consult a doctor. This may need incision and drainage. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you very much! The lump disappeared a while ago. Currently I'm often experiencing itchiness and a burning sensation in my vagina which I am assuming is Thrush. I'm using a cream to treat this, however I was wondering if taking the pill or taking antibiotics might be the cause of this thrush. Otherwise are there any other ways of preventing thrush from occuring without the use of medication?Thanks!",

    "question": "This afternoon I noticed quite a large bump close to my bikini line. Externally the bump is quite small but I can feel it extends through my skin. It doesn't hurt when I touch it, but is a little bit sensitive when I press on it hard. Also, I have not has sex nor am I a regular thorough shaver of this area.\u00a0\u00a0I've read a whole heap of forums regarding simillar issues but I'm not sure if these girls are describing smaller or larger bumps.. I haven't tried to squeeze the bump yet to see If any puss or blood comes out (and I will attempt to avoid that for as long as possible because it sounds disgusting).. Thank you!",
