            "answer": "This question should preferrably be answered by a doctor, or even better, his doctor. There are no doctors present here.Anyway, this sentence is interesting:\"Long time diabetic, never interested in taking medicine.\"Why?Untreated diabetes can be causing dilated cardiomyopathy. There is even a name for it, \"diabetic cardiomyopathy\". I assume it's a good idea to get his diabetes well regulated. It's a severe disease when untreated.If the dilated cardiomyopathy has a cause that can be treated (such as diabetes, alcoholism, too rapid heart rhythm, huge amounts of PVCs, infections) there is a chance that the heart function will improve, especially if the treatment is right and lifestyle is improved. There is hope, but he should stay in touch with his physician and follow his advice..",

            "answer": "Well that\u2019s true he must have a good doctor, family or cardiologist, preferably both. From now and on, if he wants to stay alive he has to be on medication for the rest of his life but I think, he already realized that. It is not a dead sentence. Many of us went on that road and we are doing well!!If his heart failure developed from not taking pills because he should as a\u00a0\u00a0diabetic we don\u2019t know. Maybe yes maybe no, or in and between.I had 3-4 doctors, when was in heart failure and staying in the hospital for 2 weeks had not agree and couldn\u2019t get the\u00a0\u00a0for sure answer why suddenly I developed that stage I got myself in. Part of it was long untreated high blood pressure, family history and huge amount of stress I went through for many years, but especially in the year before all happened, also I had an infection,that kicked me out\u00a0\u00a0which could be partly responsible. So after 8 years I still don\u2019t know why.I was told, the point is how to improve, not why it happened, and that also was told: if they ask 3-4 other cardiologist all might have deferent opinion.The treatment for heartfaliure for your father also must start with pills. Beta Blocker, the best choice of BB is Coreg, but might be different for him because of his diabetic body. If he do not get Coreg I would ask the doctor why he did not?\u00a0\u00a0All people I know and all those improved started on Coreg. I was on it for a year or so\u2026.after it was chenged for an other Beta Blocker. By then my 20% EF went to normal.He well need to take waterpill as well and a Calcium Channel Blocker. I was also on an other heart pill for 3 years, that I forget the name of it since.So 4 different pills for heartfaliure.That needs to be monitored by the doctor, and might need adjustment if his blood p. would drop to low, if he has high blood p. to bigin with that is better, so he will be able to have all the pills without getting way tired from them.He must change his lifestyle if any bad habit there: smoking, overeating, drinking. A red wine once a while is recommended, he should not drink\u00a0\u00a0or eat Grapefruit( juice) Must limit his water intake . His daily sodium can not go above 2000mg, but better\u00a0\u00a0keep it as less as 1600 mg in the first year at least. After that he will get use to it and wont feel to eat salty at all.So he or family should calculate all he eats for sodium.Read all the labels in the store. Plus remember all food has sodium in it even naturally, so that\u2019s a little job to do, but few weeks and he will get use to it.There are many sodium list online, I don\u2019t have a link anymore, but you could look up for him. Also important to rest enough. 7-8 hours a night,and an extra hour sleep daytime.Walking!! If he tired to do it still he should every day even if only around the house ,later a block etc. People I know those all improved ,myself included we went up to 1-2 hours walk daily. If he is tired sit down and walk again when he is feeling better.Keep happy and loving and joking attitude, it is way important his mental well being, he shouldn\u2019t feel sorry for himself ,it happen a little but sooner he is out from it sooner he will feel well!Don\u2019t be down by it, better days to come! :)",
