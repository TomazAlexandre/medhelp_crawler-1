            "answer": "Have you had low back problems before? If yes, get an MRI to see if you have a bulging lumbar disk pressing against a sciatic nerve. Neuropathy is another cause. An A1c of 11.5 may have caused nerve damage. Ask to see a Neurologist who can test for nerve damage.If you take insulin, insulin can cause low levels of potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sodium which in turn cause muscle cramps. A simple blood test can rules these out.",
