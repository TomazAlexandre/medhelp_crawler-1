            "answer": "Hi Dee!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Low thyroid, diabetes and menopause can cause an increase in possibility of arthritis. Since both the shoulder joints are involved, possibility of arthritis is more. So X-rays and MRI of the shoulder joint may help diagnose the cause of pain.Usually the treatment is physiotherapy, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and cortisone shots (if physiotherapy and painkillers fail). Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for answering my question.When I went to the doctor with the first shoulder, I did request an MRI, I was turned down because I could not prove to the insurance company all the modalities I had tried.\u00a0\u00a0The ice, heat, ultrasound, exercise stretching were all done on my own for about 5 months..I was sent to an Orthopedic who examined me, took an xray and said he felt that I had the frozen shoulder and wanted me to do 8 weeks of physical therapy, coming back to see him in 4.When I go back to him I will tell him I am starting to feel twinges in the other arm, not bad, just a little twinge here and there. I am going to work both arms to see if I can head off the other problem before it become unbearable like the first one.The physical therapy exercises are not bad, but when the Physical Therapist manipulates my arm in a way it can't go, it really hurts.Thank you againDee",

    "question": "Hello, two weeks ago I was diagnosed with Frozen Shoulder. It has been slowly coming on for many months, after a fall, or maybe because I have diabetes, am post menopausal and have low thyroid.I am going to PT for the left arm, it is very painful and I am doing at home exercises twice a day. It seems to be helping a bit.Now...my right arm is beginning to get the same twinges that started in the left arm 5 months ago.I am so confused as to why both arms would do this.\u00a0\u00a0Should I go back to the Orthopedic? get another cortizone shot?\u00a0\u00a0I do not want to lose the use of both arms at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0I am really scared now.Is there a viatmin deficiency or condition that causes this?\u00a0\u00a0I am desperate for help, it is difficult to type.Thank youDee",
