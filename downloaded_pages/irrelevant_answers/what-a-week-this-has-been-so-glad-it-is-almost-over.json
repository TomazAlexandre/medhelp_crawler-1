Who knew the breakfast could make that much of a difference?I am sorry but I did giggle when you described your injection method. Maybe they can set you up with a nurse to help you get started?I'm glad they were able to shed some light on this quickly though.Corrie",

            "answer": "I was quite surprised that just eating breakfast could cause such a problem. The theory is that my diet was just barely keeping my diabetes under control (A1C was running consistently at 6.25).\u00a0\u00a0But when I added the carbs from eating breakfast to my diet my sugar levels started stair stepping up each day. Then finally hit the breaking point for my body to handle the sugar. The last A1C was 8.2.But I am now under doctors orders to eat breakfast every day. (1 slice of toast with peanut butter). This is to make sure my morning diabetes medicine has food to interact with.As for the Insulin I think I'm out of luck for getting help. I live way out in the country and am suppose to take it at bed time. I never really know what time will be bed time each day as I sleep schedule is in constant flux.Dennis",

    "question": "Last Friday around noon I went to stand up and had my legs fold under me from extreme pain. Kind of like if you have done too much exercise, but 1000 times worse. After about 4 hours of repeated falls every time I tried to get up or sit down I finally got dressed and headed to the VA ER 2 hours away.Turns out my Glucose was at 1104. No that is not a typo. I reealy had no warning of this going on, but my doctor agrees with me that it was probably the fact that I had recently started eating breakfasts every morning (I have not eaten regular breakfasts in about 50 years) and so my diet control of my diabetes came crashing to an end. Those extra carbs each day were just more than my body could handle.So today I saw the diabetes doctor at then VA and got my first ever RX for insulin. The good news is that the RX was for a non-formulay insulin that I am to use once a day at bedtime. The bad news is I just spent over an hour trying to give myself the first shot. Just could not sick the needle in me. I have enough trouble just checking my Glucose once in a while.I don't know where this aversion to sticking needles into me comes from.\u00a0\u00a0I'm deathly allergic to bees\u00a0\u00a0 and have never been able to give myself the epipen either. even though it could mean life or death for me.So after about 2 hours I finally came up with an idea. I wedged the syringe between two pillows and accidentally feel against it. Not quite sure how ligit that is for giving me my insulin. LOLDennis",
