            "answer": "Try to do whatever exercise you can, if weight bearing exercise hurts to much try a rowing machine or upperbody carviovascular exercises.You should also try to have raw vegeabtles next to you at all times because we often eat foods without thinking about it or actually tasting what we are eating. Also try to ignore the cravings, if you are eating three meals a day this is all you need.I can also bet that if you would drop some weight you may be able to come off some or evel all the meds you are on.",

            "answer": "Have you tried Weight Watchers?\u00a0\u00a0No drugs and a healthy eating plan is what you will get.I did WW's and managed to lose a decent amount without exercising. I am a LAZY creature and I hate to exercise.I think that if you really want to lose weight you will find a plan that works for you.\u00a0\u00a0WW's does encourage exercise, but nothing that is to high impact, nor do they MAKE you exercise. Even if it is only walking, maybe after you get the first few pounds off you will see the number going down and it will encourage you to exercise. Not to mention that when you start seeing results, your pain will likely lessen with time.WW's is the only plan that I can think of, I am sure your Dr doesn't want you to take diet pills with high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I encourage you to go to a WW's facility or to even try the on-line/at home version of WW's.You can do it!",

No magic pills, but fruits and vegetables, no fat meat. Move as frequent as you can. And... just care about yourself. And don't cheat with meals, because it's cheating yourself.

    "question": "I am 36 yrs old and weigh 300. I take meds for diabetes, high blood pressure, anemia, 2 for depression/anxiety. I also suffer from 3 herniated disc in my back and neuropathy in my legs and feet from the herniated disc. My question is how can I possibly loose weight and exercise with the deck totally stacked against me?\u00a0\u00a0Three of the drugs I take have the side effect of \"significant weight gain\" (Paxil, Remeron, Avandia).\u00a0\u00a0I can't go off of any of the meds; it took me months to find the antidepressant mix that stopped the panic attacks and lifted my mood - I have been on them for 10 years!\u00a0\u00a0I have thought about the lapband but nausea triggers my panic attacks faster than anything.\u00a0\u00a0I manage to walk 1/2 mile a couple of days a week but wind up in severe pain later.\u00a0\u00a0It also seems like I constantly crave sweets and I am a @#&%$ if I don't get them.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugars are good most of the time but night binging is the worst. I am terrified of dying young even though I am a Christian. It scares me to think of who would raise my kids. I know most would say to just stop eating but that's what a thin person who has never had a weight problem would say, it's not that easy!! My childrens pediatrician is also a plus size woman who told me to just learn to love myself the way I am and quit worrying about it. I hate myself and the way I look.\u00a0\u00a0No one in my or my husbands family has ever been overweight and my husband tells me my weight doesn't bother him but I know for a fact that it does: can anyone say \"men are visual creatures\"? I honestly don't know what to do anymore.",
