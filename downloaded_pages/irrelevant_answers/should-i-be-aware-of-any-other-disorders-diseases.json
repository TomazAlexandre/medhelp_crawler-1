            "answer": "This is the result from one study \"Prevalence and relative risk of other autoimmune diseases in subjects with autoimmune thyroid disease\"...\"The frequency of another autoimmune disorder was 9.67% in Graves' disease and 14.3% in Hashimoto's thyroiditis index cases (P=.005). Rheumatoid arthritis was the most common coexisting autoimmune disorder (found in 3.15% of Graves' disease and 4.24% of Hashimoto's thyroiditis cases).Relative risks of almost all other autoimmune diseases in Graves' disease or Hashimoto's thyroiditis were significantly increased (>10 for pernicious anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, Addison's disease, celiac disease, and vitiligo).\"I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis, autommune pernicious anaemia, and vitiligo. The % risk wasn't that high but someone has to be in 14.3%. *cries* lol.",

            "answer": "Graves Disease/thyroid conditions won't \"cause\" other conditions, but having one autoimmune disease increases the likelihood of having one or more other autoimmunes.Also, autoimmunes tend to run in families, but not every family member gets the same one.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, I have Hashimoto's and Pernicious Anemia, my son has Type II diabetes and my daughter has Lupus --- all autoimmune.",

    "question": "The thought just occured to me, does having grave's disease mean I should be on the look-out for other diseases that may be more likely to strike graves patients? I have severe asthma, and was once diagnosed with arthritis, and fibromyalgia (I didn't have it.. The thyroid meds fixed my fibro symptoms!) Could my other glands be more likely to be disordered? Or am I more likely to get thyroid cancer, or arthritis or other autoimmune disorders? It'd be nice to be aware of areas of my body that might one day be likely to have something wrong.So many people on here have multiple conditions all sort of relating to the thyroid or autoimmune disorders. I wasn't told by my doctor that anything like that would happen. But I didn't ask either",
