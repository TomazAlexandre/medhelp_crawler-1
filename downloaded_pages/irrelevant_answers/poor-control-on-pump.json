            "answer": "Hi Nicole,My 17-year-old daughter and I are just back from the L.A. JDRF benefit, where we volunteered, and we took part in several pump discussions-- the pros and cons. She is staying on Lantus and Novolog for now partly out of vanity (teenage girl in a bikini, plus she's on a swim team) but also out of fear that she'll gain a lot of weight-- some people have told us that once it's so easy to eat at will (instead of giving yourself a shot), they gain a lot of weight.I have heard people with th same problem you're having, but it is addressable. Obviously it is such a relief to be able to take more of a break from diabetes maintenance that your brain is enjoying it! You can try some little reminder tricks-- so if you take off the pump to swim, for instance, put on something else you don't normally wear-- say, a Live Strong bracelet, or the Cure Diabetes one, or even a rubber band-- and seeing it on your wrist when you get out of the water will remind you to pump up again. As for testing your BG, the pump doesn't replace the need for doing that, as you know, so just make a deal with yourself-- no food without testing first. That will ensure that you test at least three or four times a day.Just a couple of thoughts. Good luck to you. I'm sure you'll figure it out and be fine.",

            "answer": "Yes, I agree with the previous posting... pumps work very much like the 24-hour Lantus, but you still need to test before you eat so you know how to adjust if your levels are not perfect. The pump doesn't adjust for you. So even though you may FEEL that the pump is doing the work to keep your sugar levels on track, it doesn't replace your brain, which has to see what the levels are and decide how to adjust to perfect the numbers. Maybe if you look at the pump as if it is a brainless\u00a0\u00a0pancreas, then you will realize and hopefully remember that it can't make decisions for you.Anyway, you KNOW this or you wouldn't be writing to ask for suggestions to help you remember. So yes, wear something that isn't normal when you swim to remind you that you are not wearing your pump, and just make it a habit to test before you eat ANYTHING. Those are wonderful suggestions. Best of luck to you.",

    "question": "I am 24 and I have been a Type 1 for 6 years now. About a year ago my Dr. put me on a pump because I was having to take so many small bolus shots durring the day. My control was fin on Lantus and Humalog, but the number of shots i was taking was inconvenient. Especially because I am athletic.....Anyways I have found Pump therapy VERY convenient... so much so that I am becoming lazy. I dont check my BG as often as I use to, I feel like I rely too much on my pump. In fact I went swimming the other day and took it off, then forgot to put it back on for almost 4 hours and ended up sky rocketing my Blood Sugar in to the 500-600's that night. I dont want to get rid of my pump, but I dont know what else to do. Has anyone else experienced this type of complacancy?HELP.",
