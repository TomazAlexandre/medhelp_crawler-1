I read\u00a0\u00a0your post sometime back regarding measurements And if you don't keep your blood glucose level within the normal range, your baby might have certain issues with the diabetes when they grow or they might even get a certain type of diabetes. I am not scarring you but I am just telling you what I heard since you were interested in knowing. What was the test you did? Was it the 10 hour fasting test? If you are on good diet hopefully things would turn positive on your next test.",
