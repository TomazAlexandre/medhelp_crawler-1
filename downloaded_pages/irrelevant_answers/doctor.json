            "answer": "MRI's were done with and without contrast. Results are as follows:Mild abnormal signal within the posterior sphenoid sinus. Left internal jugular adenopathy(level II) measures approx 11mm. C1-2 Mild degen changes noted. No signif stenoisis\u00a0\u00a0C2-3: Posterior disc/osteophyte complex &\u00a0\u00a0facet degenerative change result in mild canal stenosis. Mild to moderate right & mild left foraminal stenosis. C3-4: Posterior disc/osteophyte complex asymmetric to the left & facet degenerative change result in mild to moderalte canal stenosis. Mild to moderate right and moderate to severe left foraminal stenosis.Possible impingment of exiting left C4 nerve root at C3.\u00a0\u00a0C4-5: Posterior disc/osteophyte complex and facet degenerative change result in mild to moderate canal stenosis. Mild to moderate right and moderate left foraminal stenosis. C5-6 No sig canal stenosis. Mild bilateral foraminal stenoses. left paracentral mushrooming extrusion has been surgically removed.\u00a0\u00a0C6-7 Posterior disc/osteophyte complex and facet degenerative change result in mild canal stenosis. Mild bilateral foraminal stenosis. C7-t1 no significan stenosis. Thoracic Spine focus of T1 & T2 hyperintense signal at T9, without evidence for STIR signal, likely representing henangioma. Mild Schmorls' node endplate deformities throughout the lower thoracic spine. Degenerative changes are noted most significant at T6-7 with a right paracentral disc protrusion, with a mild assoc canal stenosis. Neuro consult found hyperreflexia in arms.\u00a0\u00a0Moderate to severe diffuse posterior neck muscle tenderness. Sensory Vibration is borderline in upper and mildly to moderately decreased in lowers. Reflexes: deep tendon reflexes somewhat brisk. Hint of myelopathy with symmetric iliopsoas and hamstring weakness, and brisk reflexes.60yr old female, smoke, diabetes type 2, fibromyalgia, DDD. I\u00a0\u00a0experience debilitating fatigue, muscle pain, mid-thoracic pain, neck pain. It's all I can do to get thru a work week. What is my outlook, in your opinion, to making it to retirement age of 66? Is there anything I can do to slow down this degeneration? Will the hemangioma need removed? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you for reading this long post.",
