            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Many a times AST and ALT (both are collectively called transaminases) rise without any cause. Because AST is found in many other organs besides the liver, including the kidneys, the muscles, and the heart, having a high level of AST does not always (but often does) indicate that there is a liver problem. For example, even vigorous exercise may elevate AST levels in the body. However to reach at that conclusion the medical causes of these raised transaminases have to be ruled out. Causes of liver transaminase elevations include viral hepatitis, alcohol use, medication use, steatosis or steatohepatitis, and cirrhosis. Steatosis and cirrhosis are ruled out by the ultrasound. Other common health conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, pancreatitis, hemolytic anemia and thyroid disease, can also cause liver transaminase elevations. Most liver diseases are characterized by greater ALT elevations than AST elevations except cirrohsis and alcohol abuse.Please discuss this with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "I got\u00a0\u00a0the results of the blood test that my physician took the other day. I am negative for Hepatitis and my AST has gone down to 40. The ALT is up to 70 but overall my doctor was happy with the results for now. He wants to retest in a month. He feels that the high enzyme levels may have been due to the Hoodia supplement that I was taking. He will retest after I have been off that for a month. I had my stress echo yesterday and passed pretty well. He said that my ST segment showed a 1mm change... whatever that means. He didn't seem too concerned....should I be concerned? I am a 54 year old woman, 5' 7\" and about 160 pounds.... still trying hard to lose 20 more pounds.Thanks",

    "question": "I went into the emergency room with heart attack symptoms. It turned out to be a false alarm for a heart attack, but the doctor was concerned because my liver function tests were high. The ast test was 146 and the alt was 68. I am following up with my physician... any ideas? I have never been one to drink alcohol and I don't smoke. They are following up with a stress echo to rule out the heart and have just sent out more blood to test for hepatitis.",
