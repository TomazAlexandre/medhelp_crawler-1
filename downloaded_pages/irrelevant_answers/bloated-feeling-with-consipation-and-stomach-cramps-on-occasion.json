            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You could be suffering from an inflammatory bowel condition such as Celiac Disease/Ulcerative Colitis/Irritable Bowel Syndrome/ Crohn\u2019s disease. Other than that it could be due to H pylori infection. It can also be food intolerance. Diabetes can cause slowing of gut and can cause bloating and hence get your blood sugar tested. It can also be due to excess consumption of food rich in sulfites like juices, molasses, yellow dye in ready made food stuffs, and red wine. Sulfites are present in lesser amounts in mashed potatoes made from dry powder, pickles, tinned shrimp, cookies, crackers, and readymade pie dough. Constipation can also cause bloating. Very sedentary lifestyle is another cause.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, my name is Max. A few months ago on a normal visit to the toilet I passed what seemed an enormous stool. Ever since then I have been experiencing a bloated feeling just below my rib-cage along with cronic constipation although I have no feeling of needing to go to the toilet. I have large amounts of gas which will only exit by burping. Very little or near to none exits via the back passage. I have dramatically increased the amount of fruit and fibre that I eat along with large quantities of water but this does not help the problem. In fact on occasion it will make things worse by giving me extreme abdominal pains. The only way I can go to the toilet and use my bowels is by taking large quantities of laxatives and sometimes colon prep medication. Additional exercise makes the bloated feeling worse and the bloating seems to be effecting my lungs as I have a very \"stiff muscles\" sensation whenever I breath in deep. This sensation is aleviated after I take laxatives and actually go to the toilet. I am still waiting to see a specialist to diagnose the problem but the waiting list is so long that I am beginning to get rather worried.I had a similar problem occur about 2 years ago but that righted itself after I began to eat additional fruit and fibre.I would be grateful to any clues as to what the problem may be.Max.",
