            "answer": "Why are you switching? Is it cause the patches have a tendency to fall off? I wear the patches and was unaware there was a liquid form. Do you have to take it daily as opposed to every 3 days like the patch. That might be a drawback, but I think if they gave me the option of liquid I'd take it. I hope this helps.",

            "answer": "I was on the fentanyl patch many years ago, but for several years, and at a high dose.\u00a0\u00a0After developing diabetes, my body temperature made the medicine enter my body too quickly and so created problems.\u00a0\u00a0At that time, there wasn't the option of oral - only IV.\u00a0\u00a0The only question I'd have is that the GI tract absorbs medicines in oral liquid form quite quickly - unless in a time release form - thereby reducing the slow release quality of the patch.I would think there would be more \"highs\" and \"lows\" of the medicine's effects.\u00a0\u00a0Even though many of us find the patch problematic - it sure is a great way to deliver the med evenly over time.I'm on a capsule, slow release form of morphine, that is taken every 24 hrs that has proven to deliver evenly - so maybe they've come out with a way for fentanyl to do the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0I say give it a try, but be careful to watch for problems with increased pain toward the end of the 24hr period, or cravings etc.I think it's great to have options out there.\u00a0\u00a0We're all different in what works for us.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you the best.\u00a0\u00a0Blessings, Jan",
