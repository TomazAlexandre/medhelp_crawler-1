Since last friday, I have felt great.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0maybe that procrit I missed, finally caught up.. I was like 14 days past due, due to a fowl up with the prescription, and the specialty pharmacy.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Maybe it finally kicked in, its been a few wks now since I got it.. In fact I have 1 left for this week, so its been almost a month. I better reorder tomorrow, so it doesnt happen again.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I will try again on the PCR, but have a feeling he is going to make me wait.\u00a0\u00a0I had one at 13 wks and one at 24 wks.\u00a0\u00a0 that were both UND.\u00a0\u00a0 but just kinda antsy to know that the last few months I have remained that way. being my 2nd time around, I want to be sure its gone for good.",

I could not stand looking so bad, my stepdaughter gave me some clothes she could not wear anymore,,\u00a0\u00a0 ( she is preg and gained weight before getting that way )\u00a0\u00a0So had a few outfits I could mix and match.\u00a0\u00a0But was dying to go shopping.\u00a0\u00a0 I could never find anything that I liked in the size I was in. All the cute clothes were for smaller people..\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 I never weighed so much till after I had treatment 14 years ago, I went from 147 to 85 lbs on tx.\u00a0\u00a0so put me on high calorie diet. and I went up to almost 275.\u00a0\u00a0and became diabetic,\u00a0\u00a0had been working on getting that down and treating the diabetes, before starting tx this time.\u00a0\u00a0Was at 257 at beginning of treatment and now I am at 164, so thats actually 93 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I am tickled pink to be this size, but all the excess skin has just got to go.\u00a0\u00a0LOL\u00a0\u00a0 But I am in a 10, and probably will be in an 8 next month some time.\u00a0\u00a0At the rate it comes off. I plan on doing what ever I can to keep the weight off.\u00a0\u00a0I am NOT going to gain it back.\u00a0\u00a0I do not want to even gain a pound of it back.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0But I know the chances that will happen are thin.\u00a0\u00a0but we eat healthy, and cut out sugar because of the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Now my sugar is completely normal.. my A1C was 4.2.\u00a0\u00a0 And when had my colonscopy last week they tested my sugar, so they would know which saline to give me.\u00a0\u00a0It was 82.. so they switched it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0My PCP is so happy that I don't have to deal with that on top of this, but its been doable.\u00a0\u00a0 If it were not for this site, I may have quit when my HGB dropped so much I felt like I was dying...\u00a0\u00a0 But I am almost there.. I can DO it..",

            "answer": "dperry10,Congrats on the weight loss, lots of incentive and meds there. If the doc lets you reduce the riba you will feel 100% better. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019re on procrit as well but if you are, really consider staying on it unless you\u2019re hemoglobin goes too high. I reduced my riba 8 weeks ago and it has gotten better every week since then but I\u2019m still on the procrit which is ok by me because it keeps everything in balance. I have 18 weeks to go and will get the full panel blood work at the end of the month. Cbc, 14 panel, thyroid, RNA,PCR and lipeds which will give me the big picture of what\u2019s happening inside and if it comes out the way I think it will, I will not go back up to the 1200mg of riba for the duration of tx. Just riding the wave and hoping for the best. Take Care!jasper",

LOL\u00a0\u00a0 Maybe it was the colon cleanse that is making me feel better ?\u00a0\u00a0 Its Monday morning, and I am going to work.\u00a0\u00a0I now only have like 7 hours to use thru the end of the year.. Unpaid at that.. but once my FMLA is recertified I will have those hours to use.\u00a0\u00a0Its now been a year, since dx and all tests completed before starting tx in Dec 06.\u00a0\u00a0Its hard to believe I am near the end now, and I can say I made it.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I just hope and pray for SVR this time around forever... Not only for myself but for everyone who suffers from this .The rash has subsided, and it I have more energy than usual.\u00a0\u00a0I actually didn't take a nap all weekend, and usually after my shot on Friday night, I spend the weekend in the pool and the bed.I should go get my blood drawn this morning, I forgot to do it Saturday.\u00a0\u00a0 I need to call and make an appt for next week, to see Gastro to go over bx of polyps, and all the results of the blood tests he ran a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0 I think he will adjust my Riba now, because of weight based doses.\u00a0\u00a0I am now below the range for the 1200 per day.\u00a0\u00a0 But we will see.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to ask him again to run that same PCR test.\u00a0\u00a0 I have not had one since wk 24.\u00a0\u00a0 And I am at 40....\u00a0\u00a0 I hate to think I have to wait 6 mos post before he does another one.\u00a0\u00a0Although the last 2 were UND.\u00a0\u00a0 I am still kinda scared. With all the breakthrus lately, it makes you wonder.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well\u00a0\u00a0I finally broke down one day last week, when I took the extra day off, and went shopping, and got some clothes that actually fit me.\u00a0\u00a0 Mike says I look like a totally different person.\u00a0\u00a0 I also got my hair cut again.\u00a0\u00a0 Nice and really short.. a boycut actually.\u00a0\u00a0 Its growing back in, so there are all these baby hairs everywhere, and it looked all uneven with the new and old in there being different lengths.\u00a0\u00a0But its healthy, just appears to be straight.\u00a0\u00a0 I think I lost my curls.. But with it this short. , who knows.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Well I just wanted to post some positive words,\u00a0\u00a0That I actually feel good for a change.\u00a0\u00a0Its not always bad.\u00a0\u00a0 And its been doable.\u00a0\u00a0 Of the 40 wks so far, I have worked for 35 of them.\u00a0\u00a0 And cannot take anymore off till after I have completed tx.\u00a0\u00a0 So heres to hoping I feel like this for the rest of my sentence....and much longer....\u00a0\u00a0LOL",
