            "answer": "I do not think I have diabetes, but my father was diagnosed with Type II at age 40 and I am 35.\u00a0\u00a0Also during my last bloodwork, my sugar was mildly elevated.\u00a0\u00a0I went again for more bloodwork again today and they will check my sugar.Would diabetic neuropathy show up during an EMG?I've had numbness and tingling in other areas (including hands/fingers), from time to time, but I have a laundry list of neurological symptoms that they can't seem to find the cause of after 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0Seizure-like episodes (non-epileptic), orthostatic hypotension, autonomic neuropathy, migraines, short-term memory problems, mitochondrial disorders, general muscular weakness and fatigue, falls after legs giving out, sleep apnea, Factor V Leiden positivity, as well as others.I've had 2 negative cervical MRI's in the past 4 years also.\u00a0\u00a0Should another one be done, or should I see if these symptoms resolve themselves?\u00a0\u00a0Also, do you think massage might be helpful?\u00a0\u00a0My shoulders are extremely tight and feel like knots--could it be something as simple as that?Thanks for your help.Theresa",

            "answer": "Have you been checked for B12 Deficiencies? I just found out that I am completely depleted of B12 and something so simple can just devastate you. It shows up with all kinds of symptoms but tingling in the fingers toes are just one. Also dizziness, blurred vision, aches/pains...You must have a malapsorbtion panel done, most doctors don't even think to request it. And, most women are lacking iron, b12, vit d....You might give this a go. I have started taking b12 shots. But it takes quite a while to get your reserves back. And, you can't get your b12 up with just supplements once it is depleted, under 200.Just a thoughtJRolfson",

    "question": "About 2 weeks ago, the tip of my right middle finger became numb.\u00a0\u00a0By the next night, it was my index, middle and ring fingers.\u00a0\u00a0Within a week, it was both hands and then up to the elbow.\u00a0\u00a0The fingertips were numb, and up to the elbow was tingly.\u00a0\u00a0Now by the end of each night, I cannot even lift my arms.\u00a0\u00a0It has spread up to the shoulder/neck area.\u00a0\u00a0Today I went for an EMG and the doctor said it was normal.\u00a0\u00a0He did the shock tests on the hands as well as the needles in the muscles, including the hands, arms and neck.\u00a0\u00a0It gets worse when I use them.\u00a0\u00a0If I do dishes or fold a load of laundry, my arms become useless and ragdoll-like and my elbows and hands feel like they are buzzing.\u00a0\u00a0The fingertips are numb.\u00a0\u00a0(I was tested for Myasthenia Gravis in the past and it came out negative.)\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas what else this could be or what else I should be tested for?\u00a0\u00a0It's not letting up at all.Thank you,Theresa",
