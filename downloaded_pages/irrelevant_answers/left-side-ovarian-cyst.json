            "answer": "Hi Kellebelle,Pain can be very frightening. Sadly, ovarian cancer rarely hurts. In part, we have not been able to have a reliable test for early detection because there are few if any symptoms to early ovarian cancer.Pain can be due to a ruptured ovarian cyst, a cyst that twists, or something unrelated such as spasm of the bowel. It is very reassuring that your pain is better.Most cysts are functional which means that your cyst may have been related to ovulation. It may look funny because of some bleeding into it which is common after ovulation. The appropriate next step is a repeat ultrasound after you have a period to see if the cyst is resolving.If you do not have any risk factors for blood clots (tobacco use, a personal or family history of blood clots, hypertension, diabetes, heart attacks), it is probably fine to take the birth control pill in your 40s. However, another option might be to just wait this out without the pill.best wishes to you",

    "question": "Hello. In the past 2 weeks during ovulation I began feeling sharp pains in my rectum. I experienced this feeling when I had an etopic pregnancy so was conerned. I am 45 years old/ had tube ligation in 1997, saw my ob last wed and went directly for an ultrasound. They found what the US tech said was \" not your average looking cyst\".My ob said the cyst is quite large with structure to it I failed to ask exactly how big also I have a lot inflamation. He prescribed pain pills and Yasmin to stop ovualtion. My questions are 1. Is the BC a good idea for someone my age??? I deal with PVC's/palps daily and also have Hashimoto's thyroiditis. 2. My pain is much better, and my bowels are moving along like they are suppose to sorry to be so graphic. My conern is my risk factor for ovarian cancer???? I called the office yesterday to ask for a better explanation of my results. I will be talking to another OB since my doctor is on vacation for 2 weeks/ he is close to retiring so is not in the office very much. I appreciate your insight.",
