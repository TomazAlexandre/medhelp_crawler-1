            "answer": "I have to disagree.\u00a0\u00a0I went to an extended release of metaformin in November, and became pg in December.\u00a0\u00a0I had also lost a bit weight in that time.\u00a0\u00a0I also did Fermera/Repronex with that cycle, but on cycles before I was doing just Repronex and not getting good responses.\u00a0\u00a0That cycle was the best response, and it worked.Also, I believe that staying on it during the pg will help reduce the chances of gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0DH's niece has PCOS, she went off of her metaformin when she got pg, and her sugar/insulin levels have been bad all the way through.\u00a0\u00a0Mine are really good.\u00a0\u00a0Plus, both my midwife and RE said to stay on it all the way through.\u00a0\u00a0I have heard several times over that it DOES cut the risk of m/c when on it.So for me, one study does not change my mind of it.\u00a0\u00a0I have just heard too many people get pg off of it, and stay on it, especially during the 1st trimester.April",

            "answer": "I am also on metformin...only the second month...that study only talks about women with PCOS...i am insulin resistant...which is why i was put on this drug...the fix the insulin problem that i have...it is an insulin drug used for diabetes...i have had cycles since being on this drug that i was unable to have on my own...patients with PCOS and no insulin resistance may fall into that study...but those of us with it benefit very much with metformin.",
