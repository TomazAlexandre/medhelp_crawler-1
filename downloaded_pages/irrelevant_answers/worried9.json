            "answer": "Hi,the numbers that you post are generally considered prediabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Not terrible, but not ideal either.Ideal fasting is around 85 (in the 80s).\u00a0\u00a0Ideal 2 hours past eating should be close to fasting levels, but may be higher (up to 120 is considered acceptable), particularly if you ate a high carb meal.Have you had an HBA1C tested?\u00a0\u00a0If so, please post the results.I would recommend the book Diabetes Solutions by Dr. Richard Bernstein, which explains diet and diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A low carbohydrate diet would probably help you manage your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0You can also use your meter to see which foods spike your blood sugar and which don't.\u00a0\u00a0Then avoid the foods that spike you.\u00a0\u00a0Generally people find that grains and processed foods, aside from sweets spike sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Somepeople are ok with fruit others are not.\u00a0\u00a0This is called eating to your meter....Hope this h elps.",

            "answer": "I'm going to assume you have recovered completely from SIBO and use non-allergenic medication to combat the asthma and GERD. No other medications/drugs/herbal supplements being used? If yes, check for interactions/contraindictions.\"...frequent need to urinate, lethargy, fatigue and often weird reactions after eating such as pale color, shaky, anxious, etc.\"I can see why you posted in this forum as your symptoms do mimic t2 diabetes. For starters, an A1c [HA1c, HBA1c] test does provide a good insight on how well you have controlled and managed your glucose levels over the past 2-3 months. This is a better snapshot than a home meter as the home test measures at the time of test, not what it was a day, week or month prior. A1c testers are available OTC. Normal range is <5%, prediabetes is 5.1% to 6%, above 6.1% diabetes. The A1c does not require fasting, can test anytime of day/night.Another thought is to have your thyroid tested. An under/over active thyroid will affect glucose levels and mimic diabetes symptoms.This link provides a checklist to see if you're a candidate http://tinyurl.com/thyroid-self-checkThis link provides a quick tip on self checking your thyroid at home\u00a0\u00a0http://tinyurl.com/thyroid-neck-check .\"...often weird reactions after eating...\"Last thought, hidden food allergies may cause a lot of your symptoms. Start a food log - date/time, type of food, portion - to see which foods have negative effects. Use a process of elimination.Good luck",

            "answer": "Well, had an episode that landed me in the ER in which heart rate went from 60 to 120 while laying in the bed. This was accompined by a shot of adrenaline (been going on for months) and sent home with a referral to check on a phenocyrotoma (sp?)tumor on my adrenal gland. My glucose on blood work was 90 about two hours after eating also. Not sure what to think anymore but am certain, it should be added, that SIBO is back.",

            "answer": "Thanks for updating us. Also am sad to hear about your ER episode, the tumor and the resurfacing SIBO. All can cause sporadic glucose levels, false/positives. With this in mind I wouldn't bother with diabetes until the tumor and SIBO are resolved. This link may help you with the tumor.
