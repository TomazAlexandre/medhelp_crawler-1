            "answer": "I certainly understand your situation. That medical business can be pretty tricky. I guess the big question is wether or not you can make it til next year? I am no doctor so I hate to speculate what might be causing your symtoms. When you say you often have flu like symtoms, do you have a low grade fever? Do you have muscle pain or joint pain? The symtoms that you have are similar to some Crohns symtoms. These symtoms are also associated with diabetes(sp). I know next to nothing about being diabetic. How long have you had the stumic problems? Let me know about these questions. From there we can discuss other things, based on your answers. I truely hope that you feel better. Remember we are all friends here. We are all hurting. That is why this forum is so good. We all get our heads together and work it out. Let us knowdolor",

            "answer": "I have checked my temp. often. A couple of times it would be 99.2,but most of the time it's below 98.2. My muscle pain is in my neck and radiates across my shoulders sometimes. Mostly, in my arms, and most of the time in my left arm. It starts mid way down my arm. Just below the deltiod. When I say I have flu like symptoms, It feels like when you stay in bed for 10-12 hours and your body starts to hurt, and gets stiff from no movement. Generally moving or a shower will stop this, but it doesn't. I then hurt most of the day. Also, when you sleep too much and you feel kind of hung over. This is what it reminds me of. I mentioned that it started in my lower abdomen, approx. 1 year ago and would radiate down the middle of my thigh. I checked my upper thigh and pelvic area to see if any glands were swollen. I never felt any inflamation, heat or saw any reddness or rash. I also reported this to my doc. several times, who seemed unconcerned and gave me muscle relaxers. My abd. and legs stopped hurting and approx. 6 months ago, I started these other symptoms. I appreciate your response. It's conforting to have someone to talk to.",

I try to stay on a low carb diet to manage my diabetes. This has never done this before. So, I haven't changed my diet.",

            "answer": "I wish I could be more helpful. Your symtoms sound like they are really difficult to deal with. I don't what to say at this point. These symtoms sound a lot like my symtoms. I get alot of those tired, hung over feelings and I quit drinking. Could it be possible that these new symtoms could be caused from being diabetic? As I said previously, I don't know much about diateates(sp) or how to spell it. What is your diet like? Do you drink? Smoke? When you get heartburn do antacids help? Do you ever feel or taste an acidy taste w/ your heartburn? I wonder if you could visit a doctor, not your normal dr. or the company dr.May be you could find someone that could at least get started helping you w/ your heartburn. Ask about proton pump inhibitors,previcid,prilosec,aciphex and my personal favorite Nexuim.good luck dolor",

            "answer": "have you had blood work done? What does your doc say about the arm pain for over a year? Do you have an swollen lymph nodes in your neck, arms, or legs? Do analgesics help? I would change docs if they aren't concerned about you having pain for so long. I am taking iron in hopes that maybe I'm anemic and thats what is causing the muscle pain. Let me know what you find out. Hope you feel better. Angie",

    "question": "I am diabetic and I'm having symptoms that I don't think are related. I started having low abdomenal pain that radiated down my legs. That went away and I started having muscle pain in my arms. This isn't daily but 3-4 times a week. I'm tired alot and sometimes feel like I have the flu but I don't. My veins have a greenish color. I have indigestion often. I wake up with it. My stomach rumbles with cramping and sometimes diarrhea. Other times I have the same stomach problems without diarrhea. I'm not trying to diagnose myself but I don't have insurance yet. It will start Jan. 1 and I'm afraid that if diagnosed with something the insurance will not cover it because it's preexisting.",
