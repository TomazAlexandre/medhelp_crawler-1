            "answer": "A1c of 5.6 means your average blood sugar is about 120.Many doctors would class this as prediabetes.I believe diabetes and prediabetes are still diabetes (like being a little bit pregnant). You have early diabetes that is not yet too severe.This is now\u00a0\u00a0your golden opportunity to exercise, eat healthy, keep your weight normal and then if you are lucky it will not progress for a long time, if ever.I strongly recommend you keep up your efforts and also continue to monitor regularly.\u00a0\u00a0You should repeat the hba1c on a regular basis (every 3 - 6 months) to monitor your status..",

    "question": "About two months ago my dr told me I had type 2 diabetes. This was based on a fasting 3 hour glucose test and likely my weight. Since then I have been checking my sugars at least twice a day and making better choices when eating. Nothing too restrictive, just less stupid. She also put me on 500 mg of metformin once a day. In that two month period my blood sugar has never measured over 119. My fasting BS (in the morning) is almost always under 100 and never over 119. Two weeks ago my A1C was 5.6. Am I truly diabetic and just doing a good job at managing it or did I just need to wise up on what I ate and when? Thanks!",
