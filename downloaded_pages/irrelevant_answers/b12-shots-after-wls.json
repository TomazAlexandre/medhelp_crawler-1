            "answer": "The reason you didn't know about B12 and weightloss before seeing it here is that you evidently have been dealing with competent and honest doctors. If your levels are normal, you don't need it. It's true that the surgery you had MIGHT have led to lower levels, and if it had, that injections might be indicated. But, as is true for most people in your situation, your levels are normal. Normal is normal. You don't need it. And if you did, it would be for treatment of a particular form of anemia, not for weight control.",

No longer need Diabetes meds, high blood pressure meds, cholesterol, arthritis etc, and lost 160 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0However I did develop anemia in 2004. I had an Iron transfusion in Jan. 2005.\u00a0\u00a0The hematologist diagnosed me with having iron deficient anemia due to poor absorption.\u00a0\u00a0My iron levels and RBC's have been high, 14+ since the infusion.\u00a0\u00a0However the fatigue hangs on, the nerves, and the fogginess, forgetfullness, also still on.\u00a0\u00a0Not much energy to do normal things.\u00a0\u00a0I have blood levels checked every few months.\u00a0\u00a0And B12 is always ok.\u00a0\u00a0I eat a B12 pill sublingual everyday.\u00a0\u00a0My question is, can someone with a gastric bypass eat b12 and have it show up sufficient in bloodwork, and yet, not be utilizing it to be dispersed through the body and provide the essentials to function RBC's, nerves, etc?\u00a0\u00a0I know pernicious anemia is caused by B12 deficiency, but my bloodwork says my levels are fine and I am not deficient.\u00a0\u00a0OF COURSE I have talked to my WLS and primary physican about this and they both say, well your levels are fine.\u00a0\u00a0You do not need B12 shots.\u00a0\u00a0Arrgghh, what is the harm in just trying the shot and see if I feel different?\u00a0\u00a0 The docs here act asthough one is asking for CRACK when they ask for a B12 shot.\u00a0\u00a0lol\u00a0\u00a0Until I came ot this site today, I did not know that B12is credited with weight loss!!\u00a0\u00a0interesting.\u00a0\u00a0ANy help is appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0A doc who might recommend B12 to me would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0THanks, Jenny",
