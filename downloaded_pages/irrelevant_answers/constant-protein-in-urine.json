            "answer": "Hello,Protein in urine is due to diabetic nephropathy (damage to the kidneys because of diabetes) or due to a compromised kidney function. Firstly, the cause of the proteinuria has to be found out. The treatment will depend on the same. For that a battery of tests are required like 24 hrs urinary excretion, all the kidney function tests. Mild proteinuria can occur due to a number of conditions and can go away on its own. Please do consult a nephrologist for examination.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "The doc I seen when the protein came back told me I was fine because the lab test came back that there was no protein. What I was wondering is why it would show on the doctors dip stick test but when the same urine is sent to the lab it would say there was no protein in it.",

    "question": "I was wondering if you can answer this for me. every time I go to the doctors office almost always when they do a urine test it comes back with bacteria or protein in it. But when they send it off to a lab it shows all is fine. This has happened so many times and I have been prescribed medications for it so many times that I developed an allergic reaction to one. Why would this thing happen with my urine so everytime? Also it happens no matter if I use mid stream or not.",
