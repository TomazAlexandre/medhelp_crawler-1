            "answer": "Hi!Weight gain during a normal pregnancy varies from 25 to 35 pounds. So a gain of 27-28 pounds is considered normal weight gain. However, if you have problems like diabetes, high blood pressure etc, your doctor may watch your weight more strictly. Do discuss this with your doctor. Take care!",
