            "answer": "Loosing weight too fast can be too much for a body and can cause a body harm. 10kgs in 4 months is about 2.5 kgs per month that's just over 1/2 kg a week. That doesn't seem too fast.However if you're not getting enough nutrients, if you're missing out on vitamins that could be devastating to your health. This could be the cause of thinning, coarse or brittle hair, glossy eyes and bad nails. Not having enough calories will also effect your mind and make it harder to focus. Also if you're loosing weight due to a medical issue such as diabetes type 1 or hyperthyroidism or that could really be dangerous too and cause problems. If this weight loss could be caused by a medical issue or you might have a vitamin deficiency I suggest talking a dr asap. All you might need is a multivitamin, but it's much better to be safe than sorry.Now because there are tons of miracle pills out there for weight loss and I have been close to several meth addicts, I have to ask are you taking anything that could be effecting your weight. Because these can and will effect the rest of your body too. Many drugs have side effects and things like meth are just nasty. My sister is 9 years sober and still battling some of the after effects it had on her health. If your weight loss is due to a drug (legal or not) talk to your dr. They will help you figure out how to get off the drug safely and how to keep your body healthy.",

            "answer": "thx for such a detailed answer!:) as i have these worries, i go searching a lot online abt it... and i believe i find i had some symptoms very close to anorexia, like bad sleeping conditions, low blood sugar level, dizzy vision, etc... yet i never deliberately controlled my diet, nor did i use any drugs. i ran a lot, and ate relatively less(as i'm now studying overseas and have to eat unbearable boarding food...). and now these symptoms have alrdy passed, the only existing condition is the continuous dropping of my hair, and nothing more. i enjoy sound sleep and do have a balanced eating pattern. so am i physically healthy now? and is it possible for one to have symptoms of anorexia without actually suffering from eating disorders? thx",

            "answer": "Many of the physical symptoms of anorexia are basically malnutrition. So yes, if you were skipping any specific food group or not having enough calories, fat, protein, veggies, fruits, etc it's very possible you had malnutrition. While it's good to be physically active you cannot burn what you do not eat- so your body finds it else where. This can be fine to a point- but even someone who has a lot of fat needed to burn- still needs a basic imput to keep a body healthy and functional. Keep up with a balanced diet and listen to your body - brittle nails, droopy hair may mean you need more protein and oils. Try to add some eggs, yogurt, nuts, etc to what you're already eating. It's hard to know if you're really physically healthy because it can take a while for your body to recover. If you have access to a school nurse or dr, perhaps you should meet with them to see if they can give you any pointers.",

            "answer": "Imagine a dinner plate. Divide it in half. 1/4 of the plate should be covered with meat (or beans, dairy, and nuts if your a vegetarian) and carbs (whole grains like a piece of toast or a serve of brown rice). The other half should be almost all veggies, with a small piece of fruit. Imagine this on a bigger scale and this is what you should be eating. If your only protein is in cakes and muffins you're going to get sick and remain sick.Personally my diet is 60% carbs, 18% fat, and the rest is protein. However, I was told by a dietician that I need more fats in my diet to have a true healthy balance. (I have a health problem that results in me getting horribly sick if I eat more than 10 g of fat in a 3 hour period.) She also said she would like me to be eating a little less carbs given my family history of diabetes, but my fuel needs to come from somewhere. So yeah my diet isn't ideal at all, but we have to do the best we can.",

    "question": "these days everyone says i'm much thinner and prettier. i guess(i never go to measure it rather accurately) i may have lost 10kg+ in less than 4 months. yet some people tell me they feel i'm now spiritless and my eyes lose focus. i'm rather worried abt it actually. i mean, according to observation, my physical health indeed is affected (my hair is dropping and it's getting incredibly thinner), so will it affect my mental health also?",
