            "answer": "Hello,Burning or tingling sensation along with pain are very common in alcoholics.Try decreasing quantity of alcohol for some days and see if these symptoms persist.Other possibilities are diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are rheumatoid arthritis and carpal tunnel syndrome transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Treatment will depend on the diagnosis.In case you need m ore information then pls post us. Please do keep me posted. Kind Regards.",
