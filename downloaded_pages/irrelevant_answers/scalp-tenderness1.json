            "answer": "Hi,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved here appears to be originating from cervical region i.e. Greater auricular nerve. Hypersensitive skin over the head could be due disturbance in nerve supply.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, abnormal endocrine status or nerve compression or impingement at the exit of nerve from vertebral column.In your case I feel it is compressive pathology.I think you should consult orthopaedician, and neurologist to evaluate your case.MRI scan of cervical spine is most important diagnostic tool in your case.Alternatively you can start taking Multivitamin supplements.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi.Scalp tenderness can have many causes. The most obvious causes, when they are present, are dermatitis or inflammatory disorders of the skin such as herpes zoster, pediculosis, tinea capitis, infected sebaceous cyst, and impetigo.In cases of temporal arteritis, the sensation may be more subtle. Tenderness can also be referred in cases of trigeminal neuralgia, sinusitis, otitis media, mastoiditis, and disorders of the teeth.You should consult a physician to assess your symptoms.",

            "answer": "I have had tenderness and short stabbing pains around the crown of my scalp which I thought was linked with an ear infection as the stabbing pain in my scalp was flowed by a stabbing pain in my ear. The doc examined me and said there was no sign of an infection. I thought it had gone but it soon afterwards came back again. I get this from time to time. Does anyone have this or know what it could be? Thanks. Richard",
