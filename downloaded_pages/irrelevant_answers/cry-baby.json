            "answer": "I don't think actual swelling is a symptom of Fibro.\u00a0\u00a0I get the feeling that they are swelling when I am in hot/humid conditions or if I am excercising, but they don't actually look swollen when that happens.\u00a0\u00a0That IS a common symptom of Fibro.\u00a0\u00a0If you have actual swelling, you need to call your doctor and have some things checked out.\u00a0\u00a0You could be having hypertension, cardiovascular problems due to diabetes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It is really easy to overlook an underlying condition because when you have fibro you tend to blame every symptom on the Fibro.\u00a0\u00a0Fibromyalgia can definitely be a secondary condition to other more serious diseases as well.\u00a0\u00a0Stay in tune with your body and what it is trying to say to you.\u00a0\u00a0 Let me know what the doc says.",
