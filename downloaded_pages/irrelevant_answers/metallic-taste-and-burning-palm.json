            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!So dental causes are ruled out in your case, except maybe an artificial filling or denture if you have. So let us look at other causes. It could also be an abnormal perception of bitter taste called dysgeusia. GERD and heart burn too cause metallic taste in mouth. Post nasal drip as in sinusitis, salivary glands infection,pharyngitis or strep infection\u00a0\u00a0too are common causes. Sjogren\u2019s syndrome and copper or lead toxicity are other possibilities. It is also possible that you have diabetes. Sjogren\u2019s syndrome too can cause decrease saliva, decrease sweat\u2014this could cause the burning sensation.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
