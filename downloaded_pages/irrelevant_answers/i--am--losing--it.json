You sound like me.Hey if you find out what is wrong please let me know!I have a doctor who is trying to figure out what is wrong with my weight and other disorders.I am hot and sweating the majority of the time. Feel dizzy most of the time, nauseated,my joints hurt especially my right hip, I will get hungry then loose my appetite. And even though I am very active I can not loose weight and seem to actually be gaining on my abs.So weird! All I know now is that it is not Diabetes or Hypoglycemia my doctor is going to check my Thyroid next.",

            "answer": "my good ness, get your thyroid checked, I am usually on the thyroid forum here on medhelp, but it's intresting to jump on these other forums, and listen to people sometimes, wondering what is going wrong in their bodies.\u00a0\u00a0I have thyroid disease, and although alot of thyroid symptoms are also related to other illnesses, sometimes, it's real easy to see, when someone is having a problem thyroid related.\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss, heat intolerance, sweating, anxiety attacks, heart palpitaitons, dizziness, diarrea, headaches, brain fog, mental block, hair loss, joint and muscle aches, tingliness, insomnia, common hyperthyroid symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0most dr's just general doctors, will check for TSH levels to see if they fall into normal range.\u00a0\u00a0Be expecially sure that if your dr, tells you that your thyroid is normal to request an antibody test to rule out auto immune thyroid disease such as Hashimoto's and Grave's disease.\u00a0\u00a0The reason I mention this is because many people suffering from these diseases often have an normal reading\u00a0\u00a0on their TSH tests, and than generally miss getting the treatment that they need. Jump on the thyroid forum, even if you do not post a new comment, you scroll on that long list and read peoples symptoms, and comments and such, you may find, that we are suffering from alot of the same symptoms as you.\u00a0\u00a0Jump on the web, check out Hypothyroidism and Hyperthyroidism, check out the list of symptoms, Your dr, is wise to check the thyroid, sounds exactly like the problem to me.\u00a0\u00a0Shannon",
