            "answer": "Hi Vicki....How is the discoloration different.? Check where the nail meets the toe. See anything odd?\u00a0\u00a0Red, swollen or yellow? Wiggle the toenail, is it loose? He may have got it caught in something\u00a0\u00a0& pulled the nail away from the toe or possibly cracked it. It may be causing him pain & he can't leave it alone. If you see any inflammation, you can apply an over the counter antibiotic ointment (Preferably with a painkiller in it). His licking is going to irritate it more. I'd watch it a few days. The two times we've had nail problems here, were both bloodbaths and I had to have the Vet remove them. :(\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Let me know what you find...Karla",

            "answer": "Hi Vicki, OK, I bet he's got it caught in something and irritated the nail. Can be something as simple as getting it stuck in a piece of carpet or hit it wrong when he landed from a jump. Here's what I'd do: The nail will tighten up (If loose) and/or the bruising will grow out as the nail grows. If you don't see any redness or swelling, then it's not infected. (Watch for this as it can happen). Wash it with soap and water and dry it real good. Your biggest problem is going to be to get him to leave it alone so it can heal. During the day, put a baby sock over it. You will have to tape the top of the sock to keep it on. At night, let it air out while he's asleep. He can take benedryl (1mg. per lb) OR baby aspirin (81mg.) to ease the irritation. It should be better in a week...................Good luck.................. KarlaP.S. If it gets infected, he will need antibiotics from the Vet.",

            "answer": "You have probably long since resolved your dog's problems. My comment is more toward the odd urination behavior, this is a red flag symptom of diabetes. And the animal needs to be seen by a vet.My dog's initial diabetes symptoms were the inappropriate urination, along with excessive thirst. He was diagnosed having diabetes, and is on daily insulin injections. The current issue is excessive paw licking. I know that human diabetics have issues with their feet, circulation and healing. So, I'm concerned that Sparky now has foot or circulation complications related to his diabetes.",
