            "answer": "I had a boy, then a girl. I've been talking to friends and they've said that number three baby is a wild card. So I'm guessing I'm just paranoid and over thinking things. I get my blood tested tomorrow, so we'll see if I'm low in iron. I was at the end of my last pregnancy, but I've been so nauseous I don't want to supplement til I know for sure",

            "answer": "If you can't keep iron down in pill form and need to take it (if your test shows you are anemic), ask about getting an iron shot.\u00a0\u00a0They give you a big bruise-looking thing that lasts seemingly forever, but mercifully you don't puke the darn pill up daily.",

    "question": "Any one else in the depths of fatigue? I'm 11w 1d and SO incredibly exhausted. I need to sleep all the time. This is my third pregnancy, so I live for the weekends when hubby is home and I can nap :). During the week I'm on full zombie mode. I have an ultrasound in a week and I'm scared it might be twins with how exhausted I am. Any mom's with twins have similar experience? Or is this just the way of a Singleton?",
