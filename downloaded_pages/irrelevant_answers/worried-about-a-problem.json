For another pediatric endocrinologist.Being admitted that many times in 2 years is way too many.If your son is on shots I would suggest\u00a0\u00a0 thinking about going on pump therapy or going on to more frequent shots daily.I hope this helps",

            "answer": "The term is short for diabetic ketoacidosis. This is when high glucose levels (often due to sickness such as a virus) cause the body to start using up its own stores of fat in order to have something to convert to energy. It can be lethal if not treated very quickly, especially in children. This is why hospitals usually hospitalize diabetic children who have ketones showing in their urine (which shows that they are in this condition). It is not something that doctors can leave alone and give more insulin and hope it will improve. It requires constant monitoring and quick medical attention to protect the child.Some people fall into this condition more easily than others, for some reason. It is never a problem for some diabetic children or adults, while others have to be on constant lookout for the presence of keytones if they get sick.",
