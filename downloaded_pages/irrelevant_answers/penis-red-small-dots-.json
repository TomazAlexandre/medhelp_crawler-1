            "answer": "No STD does anything like this. With the spots coming and going so quickly, it's probably just superficial blood vessels becoming more prominent with stimulation and changes in blood flow. Or if you're uncircumcised maybe minor inflammation (called balanitis) due to yeast, hygiene, etc. Check with your doctor if you remain concerned, but probably it's anything to worry about.",
