I assumed it was the caffeine doing that, though.\u00a0\u00a0Again, thank you for replying.\u00a0\u00a0:)",

    "question": "I am a 23 year old female with health problems that could probably rival those of any person later on in years.Now, I am asking here because I have no way I could possibly afford to see a doctor, but my health has been declining a lot in the last couple of years, and it is starting to worry me.\u00a0\u00a0I know this is not professional, but I am well aware that my age means I have little knowledge in things like this, so I want to hear from those more intelligent and knowledgeable.At 16 I began getting severe stiffness, grinding, and cracking in my joints.\u00a0\u00a0I was never overly active or under active, I merely began being unable to keep my knees bent (see: in a car) for longer than a few minutes without immense pain and loud grinding pops.\u00a0\u00a0Since then it has progressed to stiffness and swelling with the weather, constant aches and pains.\u00a0\u00a0 My family believes it to be arthritis, as it is rampant in my family and my symptoms seem much like theirs.\u00a0\u00a0However, they are all fifty years and older, so that does little to ease my mind.I have a child, four years old, with whom I had a terrible pregnancy (placental previa and bedrest from 3 months gestation until delivery).\u00a0\u00a0During my pregnancy with her, I gained upwards of 70 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, that is horribly unhealthy, and I had a hell of a time losing any of it again.\u00a0\u00a0However, two or three years ago the solution presented itself: switch to diet soda.\u00a0\u00a0Now, this seems rather trite, but it really did work.\u00a0\u00a0In a year, I had lost 50 pounds with even less activity than before (also, I know, horrible).It wasn\u2019t until the last year that my thirst started to bother me.\u00a0\u00a0It had never struck me that my ability to drink a twelve pack of soda in a few hours was unusual, or the fact that I NEED to drink over a gallon of water (oftentimes more) on top of my coffee every day.\u00a0\u00a0However, as money gets tighter and my health wanes more (sleep issues, nervous anxiety, *total* lack of energy) I begin to really worry if there is something deeper wrong with me.The arthritis and weight issues I can handle.\u00a0\u00a0But the drinking starts to bother me when I look around at my family and realize that no one else has to have a cup full of (very cold) water with them at all times.\u00a0\u00a0No one else starts yawning over and over (painfully and contagiously) on a car ride if they haven\u2019t had anything to drink in over 15 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0These aren\u2019t exaggerations, and to be honest, it is annoying the hell out of me.I appreciate anyone taking the time to read this, and if you could help I would be much obliged.",
