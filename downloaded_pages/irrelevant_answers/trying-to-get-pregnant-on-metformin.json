            "answer": "Hi,there is no reason that you can't get pregnant successfully on metformin.If you've missed your period already for a few days go ahead and test.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as you're pregnant you need to know becuase you'll need to monitor your blood sugar very closely - high blood sugar is very detrimental to baby (and pregnancy usually significantly worsen's blood sugar levels). High blood sugars during early pregnancy can affect development of the baby.\u00a0\u00a0Most doctor's will put women with diabetes on insulin while they are pregant.Best wishes",

            "answer": "i am now 11 weeks preg. and was on metphormin. the important thing to know is they will not alow you to stay on metphormine if you ar indeed preg. they made me switch which is driving me crazy due to the fact i was having a great\u00a0\u00a0result with metphormine.\u00a0\u00a0i am now on glyberide and taking 15 mg a day.6pills. i was on 2000 mg of metphormin. it is scary with everything that can happen to the baby if your sugar is not controlled in fact i am thinking of asking the doctor if i can indeed switch to insulin while i am preg. jsut to keep it better in check. i dont like the thought of needles but.. the baby is more important.it is harder to control now that i am preg but you just have to work hard at it and all should be alright.. i tested pos after 6 days of being late and got to the doctor straight away.. good luck",
