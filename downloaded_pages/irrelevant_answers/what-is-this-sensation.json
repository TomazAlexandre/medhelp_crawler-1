            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question. I think his symptoms may be due to nerve irritation in the cervical (neck) spine. This pain may be referred and perceived as occurring in the back of head & shoulders (as electric sensation), arms or chest, rather than just the neck. Other symptoms may include vertigo, nausea (dizziness) and stiffness. It will be best that you consult a neurologist who would like to prescribe Pain killers, steroid and muscle relaxants. Other treatments could be cervical orthosis such as a soft cervical collar or stiffer neck brace to restrict neck movement till you get complete recovery. In addition, cervical traction may also be suggested by the doctor, if condition is severe. Hope this helps.",

    "question": "First, background information relevant to my question. I am a 22-year-old female who has scoliosis with curves of 41 and 56 degrees. I have not had surgery for this. I have many food allergies to most healthy foods and cannot take multivitamins as they cause my skin to get eczema patches and hives so my diet is poor (though I am still figuring out what I can eat that is healthy). I do not exercise much which in my condition is foolish, I know. I have recently not been good with my water intake. Grandma on my dad's side had diabetes. Heart/circulation problems are on my mom's side of the family and I have an arrhythmia. Now to my question.I have had this burning sensation that started out in my feet about two weeks ago. Now I am experiencing this burning sensation accompanied by a numbing sensation in my feet, legs, and arms with redness all over my arms. When I wake up in the morning, I have weakness in my hands and legs. I am also experiencing trunk weakness,pulsing pain in my neck (left side), fatigue during the day after little to no activity, and feeling fatigued when I wake up. I sort of get this purplish blotchy tone to my skin on my legs if I sit too long. Sitting is when most of this worsens. My muscles just hurt and feel weak all over. My vision is fine but I am a little more unstable in my walking. Not tripping but more of a leaning to where I have to move in the direction of my lean so I don't fall. So what are the possible issues I could be having? Is this caused from poor circulation and my scoliosis possibly damaging some of my nerves?I have wanted neurological testing for a while but don't know where to go in my town to get a doctor to actually listen to me and not think I'm being an over-reacting 22-year-old drama queen. Because after all I'm \"too young to have anything seriously wrong with me\" (not to mention I get laughed at sometimes). Someone please give some helpful input.",
