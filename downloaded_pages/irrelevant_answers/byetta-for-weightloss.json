            "answer": "I know all about being overweight, AND being a diabetic. I think if you do NOT have to take medicine for Diabetes, you should consider yourself lucky. Follow your doctors advice. If I had followed mine sooner, I would not have diabetes now! One thing you MUST take into consideration, though it does help with weight loss, one side effect is LOW blood sugar, and that can be dangerous, if you are NOT diabetic and have no training to control it. I agree with your doctor, you should seek other HEALTHY strategies. My doctor had for many years told me to eat six small meals a day, nutritional foods, guess what? It does WORK! As part of my diabetes, I now HAVE to do that in order to keep my insulin levels steady. And I have lost weight with exercise and diet BEFORE I started using Byetta.\u00a0\u00a0The only reason my doctor prescribed it to me is that my previous medication was causing more severe side effects than that of Byetta. Do not use medication if you don't need to, it is not fun.",

    "question": "I am new to this site and am anxiously waiting for my doctor appointment on the 13th to talk about Byetta for weightloss. It is a medicine prescribed to diabetics but it is becoming popular as a weightloss drug for non diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0Is anyone out there taking this for weightloss and not a diabetic?I am not diabetic and am hoping my dr. will prescribe it to me. I have heard good things about this medicine and hoping it will work for me.:)",
