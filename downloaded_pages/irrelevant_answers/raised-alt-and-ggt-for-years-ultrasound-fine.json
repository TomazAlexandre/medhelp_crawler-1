            "answer": "Enzymes are released when cell death occurs. ALT is probably the most liver specific enzyme and when elevation is seen in ALT it is generally a liver issue. Most of what I have seen is ALT and AST elevations occurring together. So your normal AST - if it is really normal - surprises me.Have you had an Alkaline Phosphatase test?Have you had your Bilirubin checked?Results from those tests would be helpful.There are many liver disease other than Viral Hepatitis. There is Hemochromatosis which is an hereditary disease in which there is too much iron in the blood. There is Wilson's Disease and there are autoimmune diseases of the liver - Autoimmune Hepatitis, Primary Sclerosing Cholangitis and Primary Biliary Cirrhosis and there are more that I can't think of right now.\u00a0\u00a0And. of course, I don't think we can rule out liver damage due to alcohol.I am not mentioning these disorders because I think they are at all likely or I want to scare you. I do it because I want to impress upon you the fact that this can be a complex diagnosis.I would highly recommend that you see a hepatologist (liver specialist). GIs can be good but my experience has been that few GIs are trained and experienced enough to diagnose and treat liver disease. You said he was reluctant to order a biopsy due to the risks.All invasive procedures so involve some degree of risk but from what I know if the following criteria are met there is little risk of serious injury.1) careful screening of the patient (exclude or make special arrangements if the patient's platelet count is too low or clotting time is off)2) an experienced physician to perform the biopsy3) monitoring after the biopsy to insure no bleedingI am not advising that you have a liver biopsy because I really don't know what you should do. I am pretty sure you or your doctor shouldn't rule out a biopsy and UNLESS THERE ARE EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES I cannot recall any hepatologist who was reluctant to biopsy their patients for diagnosis due to \"risks\".I would urge you to see a hepatologist as soon as practical. I wouldn't panic but I would begin to search for the right doctor.Good luck,Mike",

            "answer": "Hi,My AST is at the upper limit of normal, Alkaline Phosphatase and Bilirubin all normal.\u00a0\u00a0Looks like I should be pushing to get some sort of diagnosis via a biopsy.ThanksDan",

            "answer": "Normal Alkaline Phosphatase and Bilirubin are encouraging.I have read articles that suggest that perhaps the reference ranges for ALT should be lowered and that an ALT of 30 or higher should prompt further tests when liver disease is suspected.I don't know the reference range for AST on your lab sheet but mine is 10 - 35 U/L and for ALT it is 9 - 60 U/L. From what I have read the range for ALT is probably too high but the AST looks reasonable to me. These ranges are from Quest Diagnostics.I still think you need to find a specialist Dan and let him/her guide you through the diagnosis procedure. I suspect that a hepatologist or experienced gastroenterologist may want a liver biopsy but I would focus on getting the right doctor rather than getting the procedure - the biopsy. You want to get a good tissue sample and you'll need a good doctor to read the slides. That would be my approach - to find the right person to diagnose and treat you. I do keep saying that - don't I? Sorry for my redundancy.Good luck Dan,Mike",

    "question": "I've had raised ALT and GGT off and on for a few years.\u00a0\u00a0I had a blood test in January after I had beening drinking quite a lot over christmas before that I had been drinking normal/ low levels and had spent a few years drinking almost nothing.In January I had ALT of 65 and GGT 110\u00a0\u00a0(these aren't much over the high reference ranges of the lab)\u00a0\u00a0I then completely abstained from Alcohol but was put on proton pump inhibitors for reflux.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor thought it was alcohol even though my AST is normal. I have remained completely abstainent and have been tested each month since then and my results have started to go up peaking at ALT 130 and GGT 195. I had some URQ pains but these might be due to the reflux.\u00a0\u00a0I ate large amounts of fatty food the night before the tests because the doctor seemed to believe that would have no affect.\u00a0\u00a0I was also tested for Hep ABC and kidney problems, all results were normal.I went for an ultrasound today and was told the ultrasound showed everything to be perfectly normal.Can you have these elevated enzymes for years without damage? Everything I read seems to suggest I'm going to end up with fibrosis and then cirhosis if this isn't stopped and it seems if I can't stop the damage through not drinking then there isn't a very good prognosis and no treatment.The doctor referred me for an ultrasound because she thought that the cause might not be alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0What else could it be if the ultrasound is normal with no fatty liver?\u00a0\u00a0My son has multiple food allergies and I wondered if I was allergic to something and that might be causing this as I've never been aware of any allergies but my family have various allergies to diary and wheat, etc.\u00a0\u00a0My Grandmother also had type 2 diabetes and I am about 2 stone overweight and have done almost no exercise for 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be the early stages of diabetes?Should I be pushing to have a biopsy? (The GI specialist seemed reluctant a few years ago when I was refered due to the risks.)",
