            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Your GTT test results were surprising. I would recommend speaking with your endocrinologist about what your next steps should be. Perhaps you could also speak with a dietician and find ways to change your diet to help keep your blood sugar levels steady. This could help prevent/postpone diabetes symptoms.Cathy",

    "question": "Hi all,I am 30 years old, exercise, with a fairly clean diet, no family history of diabetes. I have recently visited an endo because my fasting glucose was a bit high, 95 on the last blood work. Every other test was completely normal. After a complete blood/urine test, everything came back normal, including A1C of 4.8My endo suggested that I can take the glucose tolerance test to be sure (he is very thorough). I even bought a glucose meter and tested myself for a week (2 hrs postmeal was around 120).I just got home, very depressed about my GTT results.Base - 961/2 hr - 2721 hr - 2201.5 hr - 1902 hr - 170These are VERY diabetic levels. My endo was just as shocked as I was. He told me he has never seen anything like that before in his 30 years of practice. He has seen people with A1c levels of 6.5+ with normal glucose tolerance test, but not the other way around. My fructosamine levels are within normal range too.Needless to say, I am very depressed right now. Would love to hear any feedback.V",
