            "answer": "Have they done bloodwork to check for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0A lot of times diabetes will cause weight LOSS instead of gain, but the constant hunger can be a symptom of the disease.I would definitely pursue the thyroid issue especially since it runs in the famly.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe request an ultrasound of the thyroid and definitely request another round of the bloodwork.Is your daughter taking any other medications other than the Miralax?\u00a0\u00a0the stomach pains could be related to the constipation - I know my stomach hurts a lot if I have trouble with it.I would also suggest having her tested for Gastric Reflux - the burping and pain in the neck could be symptoms of this, even if she doesn't complain of heartburn.\u00a0\u00a0Again, reflux can cause stomach pain.\u00a0\u00a0Meanwhile, I would try to eliminate anything carbonated if she drinks things like that - they can definitely add to gas/burping and also stomach pain.Have you also tried experimenting with her diet - elminating things like dairy or wheat products and seeing if that has any affect on her?\u00a0\u00a0I had a milk allergy as a child and my main symptoms were abdominal pain and constipation.\u00a0\u00a0If you do try to experiment with her diet - I would elminate those type of things first, then slowly add things back to see if you can determine what, if anything, triggers the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I would only add back one item at a time, such as cheese, then wait a couple of days before adding back something else.\u00a0\u00a0That way it should be easier to determine if anything causes changes.You could also request that your pediatrician recommend/refer you to a pediatric gastro doc and see if they have any other ideas/tests they could run.\u00a0\u00a0More of a \"specialist\" like that might have better insight to things that a general pediatrician.I hope your daughter feels better soon!\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Make sure your daughter sees aand Endocrinologist regarding her thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Our endocrine system impacts every organ of the body, An Endo will will also check for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I hope she's already on medication as the thyroid obviously is not functioning properly.\u00a0\u00a0The endocrine system can throw many thing out of whack so this is a good place to start. I also, recommend getting a pediatric Gastroenterologist involved.",
