            "answer": "Hey, I'm taking Phentermine 37.5 mg daily. I've lost 20 pounds since Feb 1st. But I make myself eat. My son was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes in January, and I eat what he eats. I figured if I teach myself to eat healthy now I will be able to keep the weight off when I'm done with the phentermine. It only gave me \"energy\" the 1st week. After that...nothing. It DID help my hunger. Still does. I'm just trying to do this as healthy as possible. I've taken it before and starved myself, lost a lot of weight, didnt change anything or learn anything from it, and gained it all back and then some!! So, with my son as my inspiration, I've changed a lot of things. I exercise everyday for 45 mins. Walk, Gazelle, weights, everyday something different. I would suggest calling your Dr and seeing if they would up your mg to 37.5. I've never taken 30...it would probably do nothing for me!! Also I go once a month for a b12 injection. I haven't seen a difference with that but I'm hoping it'll kick in asap!! Good luck and update when u go to the Dr! :)",

    "question": "Can anyone please tell me how much weight I can expect to loose while taking phentermine? I started taking it on 2/16/10 I have only lost 2lbs. I take 30mgs of it. It does not seem to be working for me. I am still hungry and I dnt have all that much energy like they say I would. I watch my calorie intake and do some exercise. Why is this not working for me? I go back to see the Dr. on 3/2/10 what should I do? I'm spending money and not getting the results I would like not to mention pretty much starving myself because of my calorie intake. Should i see how the second week will go. I mean is this something that has to get in your system and have time to work. I'm soo confused can someone please give me some advice?",
