    "question": "Hello,I have a medical concern.I don`t have any type of diabetes as well as my family members.Already 2-3 weeks i have some of diabetes symptoms ( thirst and frequent urinating).Around that period i had a pretty big stress.I talked to my doctor : i made Blood Test, urine test, ultrasound of abdomen, a1c test.I bought Glucometer to check my glucose level even.a1c came up as 5.3I had high cholesterol, but doctor told that i need to exercise a little bit more and it will be ok ( it`s not too high) , but i didnt have any overweight problems definitely.My doctor told that 5.3 its a normal level and if i want i can retest it in 1-2 month period.Today its around 1 month after first symptoms.I am trying to monitor my glucose level probably because i am very anxious about it.I was on\u00a0\u00a0a diet ( low carb diet) and i lost about 3 kg in a pretty short period of time 2-3 weeks +\u00a0\u00a0i was exercising each day ( swimming).And when i tested my blood glucose it always was in normal range. ( around 80 fasting around 100 after a meal)Today i decided to make an experiment and to eatpack of California roll ( white rice some sauce and i think a crab meat) + i ate a red apple after this.I checked my BG level in 1 ( probably 45 minutes)\u00a0\u00a0hour and it was around 140-150And in 2 hours it was around 110-115In around 3 hours my glucose was 74-78.Is such jump is normal?How i would know if there is a Type 1 Diabetes or Pre Diabetes or Type 2?Do i need to do any other testing which will help me to find the solution?I am male, 23 years old, 186 cm, 79kg.I don`t have overweight problems at all which are common to type 2.And as i understand the people with type 1 Diabetes always need insulin to stay healthy, and if they will dont use insulin their organism will not be able to use sugar. ( it will gather in their blood).But my fasting sugar is always around 80-85",
