            "answer": "I have a child that is 13 and since she was about 4 we thought she was a diabetic, my mom who is a nurse told me that I should have her tested and I did. The doctor did a regular fasting BG and it was 110 (high but still normal) she has had a few high BG readings, I am diabetic so I check her BG also. She goes to the bathroom a lot especially at night, and she is always hungry. My mom told me to tell the doctor to do a glucose tolerance test but the doctor did a fasting BG and although it was high it was still within normal range so he didn't find a reason to do a tolerance test. Then my daughter has this rash on the back o her neck and when we went to the dermatologist he said she had a high insulin problem and that is what caused the rash. They did blood work again but it was only 112 so they said that she might be pre-diabetic. I have been researching it and I have not found an answer and the doctor don't know either. So what I did was put her on the same diet that I eat and monitor her BG in the am and 2 hours after 1 meal every couple of days. This information I will take to the next doctors appt and tell him to figure it out. So I would advise you to ask your pediatrician to do a glucose tolerance test. I hope some of this helps...",

    "question": "What other conditions can cause higher than normal fasting blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0My daughter has been \"flirting\" with diabetes since she was very young.\u00a0\u00a0She had ONE test that showed her BG to be 350 ish and then it recovered pretty quickly on its own.\u00a0\u00a0Though we did get to spend a few days in the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I think that was not needed.\u00a0\u00a0Once more in the hospital it was 200, but that was after they had her drink grape juice and orange juice and another juice in an hour time to \"battle dehydration.\"\u00a0\u00a0They tried to get me to give her a 7 UP, too! I think they were trying to get high readings.\u00a0\u00a0I never allow her to drink that much juice and drew the line at the soda.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, her blood was fine after that little weekend.\u00a0\u00a0Now fastforward.\u00a0\u00a0She is 8 and is having slightly elevated blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Her morning FBG was 126 so she had the A1c test and came back with 5.7%.\u00a0\u00a0At the time it was peach season and she was eating a lot of peaches.\u00a0\u00a0So I cut back on the raw fruits I was letting her eat and it all normalized.\u00a0\u00a0Now she is having issues again.\u00a0\u00a0She told me when she wakes up she feels sick to her stomach and dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0So we started checking again. Now her FBG is 110, and 90.\u00a0\u00a0Kind of high, but not really high.\u00a0\u00a0While I wait for her pediatrician to get back into town next week I thought I would pick your brains...\u00a0\u00a0Anyone KNOW of another reason for high blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0I really dont' think she has diabetes, because most of the time she is fine.\u00a0\u00a0She does pee more than average and especially at night.\u00a0\u00a0She is a small girl (smaller than average) but hasn't been losing weight or anything that concerns me.\u00a0\u00a0She is ALWAYS hungry and especially craves fruit.\u00a0\u00a0But again most of the time her BG is perfect.\u00a0\u00a0In fact today I even let her have a special treat of sticky roll for breakfast and then an apple and an hour later her BG was 108.\u00a0\u00a0See? Fine.\u00a0\u00a0SOOOOO What else could be messing with her blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0Google has been no help at all for me.\u00a0\u00a0THANKS!",
