            "answer": "Good for you trying to get understanding of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0When a person becomes diabetic the last thing to go bad is the fasting BG.\u00a0\u00a0I dont know why MD use the fasting as the criteria.\u00a0\u00a0By the time the fasting is bad your BG is outta wack especially after eating carbs.To know how many carbs you can eat .test BG before eating (gives a base line)count how many carbs your going to eat.test 1 hour and 2 hours after eating take the highest reading.Ideally you want your BG not over 140 and or no more than a 40 pt rise.If you constantly have the hirer reading at 1 hour you can stop the 2 hour test and vise versa.",

            "answer": "It is frustrating for that fasting morning BG to be higher than expected. I'm an RN and there is a phenomenon that can occur with people like us that have insulin resistance called the somogyi effect. This is where your liver will respond to a drop in your BG usually between 0200-0400 in the early morning hours and it releases glucose to counter the drop. Having a good high quality protein with a small amount of carbs before bedtime will sometimes help with this. I too have found that I just can't eat many carbs or my BG really spikes. I have switched to nuts and apples and low fat cheese for snacks. Yogurt with no added sugar etc. and on a side note since I really cranked down on the carbs I've lost 12 lbs and my a1c is now running around 6.2. Was as high as 7. Hang in and experiment with you food and monitoring your BS frequently you'll find that \"sweet\" spot!!",

            "answer": "80 to 100 upon waking is OK. The more physically active you are, the more carbs you need to eat. You cannot go without carbs or sugars completely.Read up on carbohydrates and learn which foods with carbs are actually good diabetics. Hint: popcorn is not on the good list, but it is not on the \"never eat list\" either. Most veggies and fruits are very good carbs for diabetics. (Not all!)There are a lot of phenomenon foods that you think diabetics should avoid, but really are quite good for you. You just have to do a lot of reading. Be wary of the fad diets and the dietary supplements that supposedly \"get you off your diabetes meds\" by just adding this wonderful powder to every meal. The stuff is way cheaper than insulin, and I mean WAY cheaper. Stay away from it. If you try that stuff, the only numbers going down are your bank balances.Finally, check your levels, chart them, and keep going. Stressing over an occasional high waking number is not good either. I use two apps on my phone to track meds, BG, meals/carbs, BP and pulse. It also has a way to add stress, illness, activity levels, and other things.\u00a0\u00a0The app is called Diabetes Connect. The other is a nutrition guide that focuses on carbs. It has most chain restaurants, grocery store foods, and generic food items. It basically helps you figure out the carbs you eat. It is called NutritionLookup.Do some light reading on how A1C is determined. Our bodies are amazingly complex and simple at the same time. The A1C on your app is not going to be the same as when you get your next one done by the lab. I test 3 to 6 times per day. My app has been off by as much as 1.5 points; rarely is it in my favor. Grrrr... LOL",

    "question": "I'm apparently prediabetic according to my doctor. I only test my BG in the morning before breakfast, at least 8 hours after my last meal.3 days on a no carb diet got my BG levels below 100 but with almost any carbs in a day\u00a0\u00a0it goes back above 100.I'm trying to give e my body a break from carbs to increases my insulin sensitivity, and establish some baselines on how many carbs I can eat and still get fasting reading below 100.I'm not sure how to interpret these results. It looks like I can hardly eat carbs at all without going into predisbetic range, but the app says all my readings are in a healthy range and estimates my A1C at 5.7%, saying I'm very low risk.I know that the app is not a diagnostic tool. I'm just trying to establish a healthy pattern to hopefully prevent going full diabetic.Does anyone have thoughts on how I should interpret my readings? This is all new to me, and not a particularly pleasant experience.",
