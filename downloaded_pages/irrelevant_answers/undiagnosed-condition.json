The Dr do not know what it is yet.. I've had a couple MRI which showed some lesions, but they said not MS?I did have the ENT Ear specialist test me a few times and said it isn't my ears??Have you had blood test done yet?keep in touchAndrea",

            "answer": "Hello and welcome to the forum,I always hesitate to give advice when directly asked for MS diagosee's (sp? lol) as I have a couple different opinions on my situation. My Neuro believes my illness is a combination of complications from diabetes, stroke, and chronic epstein barr virus.While there is no doubt that I have diabetes and Ebv, another doctor states his diagnosis is also MS. So I'm kind of a limbo-lander as my own Neuro has not agreed with the other's MS diagnosis.I do suffer from reoccurring light-headedness and unsteadiness also. I have constantly throughout this came up with low blood pressure and low heart rate readings. Recently they discovered (not sure why anyone didn't before this) is Orthostatic low blood pressure, or Orthostatic hypotension.This can make you feel very dizzy I have been told.Of course, another thing that comes to mind with the prickly, is diabetes of course. Probably they checked already for these more common possibilties? Just things that came to my mind.Hopefully someone can stop by and offer some answers for you,Jazzy",

            "answer": "Hi, and Welcome to the forum!\u00a0\u00a0I am the resident and unofficial MD here and I happen to have both chronic, intractable vertigo from Autoimmune Inner Ear Disease and (5 years later developed) MS.\u00a0\u00a0As far as we know the two are not related.I suspect you are going for Vestibular testing with a specialist called a neuro-otologist (or otoneurologist).\u00a0\u00a0They have many tests available to try to distinguish whether the vertigo is originating in the inner ear or the brainstem.\u00a0\u00a0If it is the inner ear it is a \"peripheral\" problem and not related to MS.\u00a0\u00a0If it is from the Brain stem or the 8th cranial nerve (both of which are part of the central nervous system), it might be a part of MS.The answer to your question is that central vertigo is a common presenting symptom in MS.\u00a0\u00a0We see it all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Vertigo in all of it's manifestations is incredibly incapacitating.\u00a0\u00a0We use many different parts of the brain and inner ear to keep ourselves oriented in space.\u00a0\u00a0When that is disrupted the first system that is asked to pick up the slack is the visual system.\u00a0\u00a0Having to depend on the eyes and visual perception of vertical lines and the horizon causes enormous and debilitating fatigue, cognitive confusion, and even memory difficulties.Have you had any hearing loss, even temporary?\u00a0\u00a0Or does your hearing fluccuate?\u00a0\u00a0If so they should also be considering Menier's disease.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have tinnitus?The episodes of pins and needles with muscle spasms does not fit with any purely vestibular diagnosis whether central or peripheral.\u00a0\u00a0And the episodes have lasted long enough to be of concern.\u00a0\u00a0The vestibular testing will not likely give you any information on your paresthesias or the muslce spasms.\u00a0\u00a0At this point I would recommend a repeat MRI of your brain and spinal cord done without and with contrast.As far as constant unsteadiness as a constant symptom - yes, it is common in MS.\u00a0\u00a0Just yesterday I was commenting to someone that I often feel like I'm in a giant cosmic pinball machine (though, again, my vertigo is a separate disoder from my MS)\u00a0\u00a0Do you weave back and forth down the hall and miss most of the doorways you aim at?I also hope you do not have MS, but your symptoms are now reaching beyond the vestibular and need a re-evaluation.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you do stay with us and keep us apprised of your progress, or better yet, join us for the fun.\u00a0\u00a0Being in Diagnostic Limbo sucks bigtime!\u00a0\u00a0We can help make it more bearable and more understandable.Are you aware of the VEstibular Disorders of America - VEDA?\u00a0\u00a0they have a list of vestibular specialists across the country and hav some good info on their site:vestibular.orgI hope this has helped.\u00a0\u00a0I see one of the world's foremost experts on vertigo (he developed the internationally accepted \"Epley Maneuvers\") so I have learned a great deal about vertigo and how it can bring your life to a total crashing (literally) halt.\u00a0\u00a0You have my utmost sympathy.Quix, MD",

    "question": "Hi Everyone -I'm new to the forum and I've been living with a condition for almost two years now that is undiagnosed, but is thought to be Vestibular (balance part of your ear) related.\u00a0\u00a0I had three acute attacks back in late '05 and early '06 that basically threw all my senses out of whack and the predominant feeling i remember was the floor feeling like it disappeared beneath me and I became very light-headed and unsteady.\u00a0\u00a0After the third acute attack (which brought me to the ER), the symptoms have persisted and haven't gone away since.\u00a0\u00a0My chief complaint is feeling unsteady on my feet, having brain fog and feeling detached from the real world.\u00a0\u00a0I don't get classic vertigo, but rather at times feel like the ground is moving or throbbing beneath my feet.\u00a0\u00a0Other symptoms include pressure in eyes, ears, visual auras, sensitivity to changes in light, etc.\u00a0\u00a0These symptoms seem to come and go though.The reason why I'm in the MS section is b/c within the past 6 weeks, I have had three isolated incidents of muscle spasming coupled with prickly pins and needles (mostly in my legs).\u00a0\u00a0The first lasted about 5 days and then subsided.\u00a0\u00a010 days later, it came back for about a week and then subsided.\u00a0\u00a0Then about a week later (a few days ago), it came back and only lasted about 2 days.I guess my question is, do any of you that have MS suffer from dizziness/unsteadiness as a consistent symptom?\u00a0\u00a0Also, has anyone here been misdiagnosed with a vestibular condition, only to find out that it's really MS?So thats my run up to present.\u00a0\u00a0And these are the tests that I've had done so far:CT Scan (May 2006) -- normalMRI (July 2006) -- normalComplete Eye Exam (April 2007) -- normalHearing tests (April & July 2007) -- normalMy next step is to get the battery of Vestibular testing done to rule out that it is eithe rmy ear or not that is causing all this.\u00a0\u00a0If not, it's probably off to the Mayo Clinic.thanks everybody!!erik",
