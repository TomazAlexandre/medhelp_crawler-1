A good cross reference list of symptoms and diseases that mimi MS can be found athttp://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/multiple-sclerosis-000474.htmDiabetes can cause fatigue, numbness and\u00a0\u00a0vision problems\u00a0\u00a0among other things and it would be good if you can get this under control, whether it is causing your other problems of not.Good luck at the neuro and be sure to let us know how the appointment unfolds.",

    "question": "I am extremely concerned an frightened that I have MS. I am a 20 year old African American male. Here are a list of my symptoms:Constant tingling that started in right foot and then began in left footFeels like the tingling moved up my legs but feels like a more shaky feelingHands feel like they fall asleep; however only get this sensation when waking up or resting on my elbowsBurning and itching sensations that come and go and really don't happen that oftenPressure on my ankles and feet that doesn't happen too oftenVision seems like it got worse; went to eye doctor and found out I have a cataract in one eyeSlight blurry vision when waking up; happens rarelyWeird pain sensations in random places rarelyWeird feeling in kneesThrobbing or heartbeat feeling in feet and handsThrobbing in back of headI know that is a lot but that is what I have been experiencing for the last two months. Every sensation is intermittent except the tingling in feet and legs. That tingling is constant everyday. I got my b12 level checked and it was 363. I also had my blood sugar level checked and I was in the prediabtes range. Does this sound like MS. I have literally been on google everyday since the slight tingling in my foot began and I have had anxiety about these sensations ever since. Does this sound like MS? I have a neurologist appointment this Thursday. Any thoughts? You can be extremely honest, I can handle it. :-)",
