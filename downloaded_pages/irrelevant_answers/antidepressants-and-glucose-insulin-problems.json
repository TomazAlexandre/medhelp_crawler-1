    "question": "Hello, I took zyprexa (antipsychotic) for 4 years and have taken cymbalta (antidepressant) for 5 years. I gained a lot of weight (50lbs), and started to have insulin resistance problems and high glucose levels. I was put on metformin 500mg once a day for a year. I was told that if I lost the weight my numbers would go back to normal. I lost 40lbs, I am exercising and eating healthy. My doctor told me that I could quit metformin. I was very conservative and instead of quitting I was taking half pill (250mg). Still, I got these symptoms: extreme thirst, extreme hunger, frequent urination, felt I wasn\u00b4t absorbing the food I ate return of psychotic symptoms. I went back to the doctor who found my numbers had not improved but worsened after a year and told me I had impaired glucose tolerance and that I had to keep on taking 500mg metformin. She didn\u00b4t understand why my numbers didn\u00b4t improve, since I had lost 40lbs and didn\u00b4t have family history of diabetes.Another important thing to mention, is that I have been weaning from the cymbalta (antidepressant). I did as my doctor suggested (I am taking my metformin everyday), but have found many times my blood sugar levels around 68-92 after 2 hours of eating.I am just so confused. I feel that my glucose levels have been affected by these 2 medications. I do not know if this impaired glucose tolerance is something permanent or if it can be resolved. Any comments or suggestions are welcome",
