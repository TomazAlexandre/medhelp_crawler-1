    "question": "I am a 54 years old, and have Type II Diabetes (since 1995), very poorly controlled. That's on me. My problem is that I have ED and Retrograde Ejaculation. I was married for 19 years, and my sex life during that time was not very good. Intercourse in the mission position maybe once a week, and masturbation in between. Very exciting right! NOT . Somewhere towards the end of my marriage in 2008 I started to get ED. I spoke with my doctor about it and he gave Levitra and Viagra. Both helped somewhat but not like I would have thought it should. From what I\u00a0\u00a0have read here, that was probably due to the marriage and sexual anxiety.Since I divorced, I have not had sex at all. I only have masturbated, and over the years, my erections have gone away, and about 6 years ago, developed Retrograde Ejaculation. Now while I haven't had sex with a partner in that time it hasn't been an issue, but now I am in a long distance relationship over the internet. We talk sex with each other so she is aware of my problem and assures me that it isn't a problem. She is much younger than me, and would like to have a baby. So my question is, could the RE be a result of the ED because the muscles that help move the sperm are the same ones that make the erection, and can the problem be reversed? Or will I have to have surgical medical help to get the sperm needed to make a baby?\u00a0\u00a0Please help!",
