            "answer": "If you fast\u00a0\u00a0(at least 2 hours before) it will give you a more accurate reading, but at least stay away from high carb/sugary foods and drinks before hand. I did fast and was diagnosed with gestational diabetes due to extremely high blood sugars (they wanted 140 I was at almost 300) and they didn't move on to the 3 hour test. So if you have it, you have it and then you just have to learn how to manage it.",
