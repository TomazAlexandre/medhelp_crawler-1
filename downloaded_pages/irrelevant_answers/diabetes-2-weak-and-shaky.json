            "answer": "You are experiencing extremely high blood sugars and then coming back down to normal levels. This is going to make you feel pretty bad until you stablize. Since you have been used to very high levels, even a 98 will feel like hypoglycemia for awhile.You don't say what treatment you have been given. I'm also concerned that you say you are not sure yet if it is Type 1 or Type 2. If there is a question you should see an endocrinologist not a regular pcp. The testing for Type includes c-peptide which determines how much insulin you are making;type 1's (or LADAs which you may be) make very little, type 2's make a normal or excessive amount. The determining test though is Antibody testing as type 1's produce antibodies and type 2's do not. I was myself misdiagnosed as type 2 at age 58 and am in fact LADA. Some of the clues that led me to recognize this: I lost a lot of weight before and after diagnosis, I have another autoimmune condition (thyroid), I only managed on oral meds for a little over a year (you aren't there yet obviously) and my c-peptide was very low.I recommend the book Blood Sugar 101 which you can access online or buy by Jennie Ruhl.",

Besides water you can drink the many kinds of sugar-free drinks, coffee, tea, even wine. The key is to find things you enjoy eating that are lower carb. Think of it as a challenge!
