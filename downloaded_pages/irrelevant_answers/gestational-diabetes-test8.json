            "answer": "I wasn't allowed to eat for 12 hours before my 3 hour.test, also the drink is small and not bad. The orange tastes like fanta and the red one tastes like syrupy hawaiian punch. The worst for me is you have to give blood 4 times. Once when you get there and then again every hour for the 3 hours. I hate needles though. I get my results my results tomorrow. I hope the results come out normal.",

            "answer": "I just did mine last week. It wasn't bad. I wasn't able to eat after midnight the night before and then could only have water during the test. It was hard in was hungry close to the end. But it went by pretty quick. I only felt kinda weak as I got home and was eating. I finally mate around 1130! Was along time to go without food and each person will be different. The 3 hr drink is sweeter than the one hour one.",

            "answer": "The part that ***** the most is I'd your instructed to stay at the office. I have kaiser they just had me go in and put every time. So I would keep myself busy till it was time go on in. But you definitely\u00a0\u00a0can't eat. Waters ok. They do take a control blood test then you drink the stuff under 5 min then the minYour done it's written Down and your told when your next blood hrs are. After my 3 blood draw I was getting really hungry I fasted from 745 pm the night before by the time my last blood draw happened when I got to my mom's ( she lives across the street from the kaiser I was going) I was sweating,felt loopy ,faint, hungry,breathing fast.... but j thought I was just me hungry but as soon as I walked into the kitchen into ate and ate and ate. Then just kinda relaxed till all those feelings\u00a0\u00a0subsided. As it turns out my blood sugar went dangerously\u00a0\u00a0low from 3 blood draw to the last. So I suggest keep a snack in the car for right after. Some thing like a twinky.... it's bready\u00a0\u00a0and sweet... just think carb\u00a0\u00a0snack.my 3 hr glucose test with\u00a0\u00a0my first 2 kids were similar. I never pass the 1 hr test even if I fast before hand. But my results come back normal or just low at the end of it all. But it's a pain in the butt.",
