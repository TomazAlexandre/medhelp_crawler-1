            "answer": "Vitamin D is the new \"it\" vitamin and more media exposure is coming out on the health problems linked to a vitamin D deficiency. More doctors are now also testing for it. At your age, doctors should routinely test for a vitamin D deficiency as your skin is now converting less vitamin D from sunlight.For the past 80 years it was believed that vitamin D3 was only important to the body for regulating calcium and protecting the bones.\u00a0\u00a0However hundreds, if not thousands, of studies now show this vitamin (technically a steroid hormone) plays a vital role in health.Vitamin D deficiency seriously impacts 32 organs especially the heart and bones.\u00a0\u00a0Research carried out at the University of Copenhagen has revealed that vitamin D also activates the immune system by \"arming\" T cells to fight off infections. Yet another study found a 77% increased risk of cancer with a vitamin D deficiency.Research has implicated vitamin D deficiency as a major factor in the pathology of at least 17 varieties of cancer as well as heart disease, stroke, hypertension/high blood pressure, autoimmune diseases like multiple sclerosis, diabetes, depression, obesity, chronic muscle and/or joint pain, osteoarthritis, osteoporosis, muscle weakness, muscle wasting, birth defects, periodontal disease, influenza, and more.A new study published in the March, 2010 issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that 59% were vitamin D deficient and another 25% were found to have extremely low levels of vitamin D.Studies indicate that for proper health, serum vitamin D levels should be a minimum of 50 ng/mL (125 nmol/L), with optimal levels falling between 50-80 ng/mL (125-200 nmol/L). These values apply to both children and adults.Causes of vitamin D deficiency include:* Lack of sunlight* Living north of 35\u00b0 latitude (eg: Europe, Canada, two thirds of the US). There are no UVB rays between the months of November through March due to the angle of the sun* Dark or black skin needs up to 10 times the amount of sun than light skin to absorb vitamin D in their skin* Wearing sunscreen - prevents absorption of UVB rays* Lack of vitamin D co-factors - magnesium (most important co factor), zinc, vitamin K2, boron, and a tiny amount of vitamin A*\u00a0\u00a0Too much calcium will lead to a magnesium deficiency and in turn will lead to a vitamin D deficiency* Low cholesterol - cholesterol is the precursor to vitamin D. Vitamin D3 is made in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol absorbs UVB ultraviolet light at wavelengths between 270--300 nm* Kidney and liver disease - vitamin D is processed (metabolized) by the liver and kidneys into an active form of vitamin D* Hashimoto's Thyroiditis - genetic defects in the receptor site for vitamin D* Parathyroid conditions (parathyroid - glands in front of the thyroid). PTH (parathyroid hormone) regulates calcium in the blood. As the calcium level increases, the level of vitamin D decreases* Malabsorption problems like Celiac's disease, Crohn's disease* Medications - statins (cholesterol lowering drugs), acid lowering medications, anti-inflammatories, laxatives, prednisone, corticosteroids, barbiturates* Very large or obese body, as a larger body requires more vitamin D* Very low fat diet; in order to absorb vitamin D the body needs to have fat (vitamin D is fat-soluble)* Older age, as the skin converts less vitamin D from sunlight* Fat malabsorption conditions such as Cystic Fibrosis* Strict vegetarian diet - natural food sources of vitamin D are animal-based* Hereditary disorders- Renal 1 alpha-hydroxylase deficiency (also called type I hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets)- Type II Hereditary Vitamin D-Dependent Rickets- Type III hereditary vitamin D-dependent rickets",

            "answer": "Hello,'m a 32yr old female, i also have low VD, from what ive learned its a very important vitamin we absorb from the sun...start researching online ive found alot of info,but this is the norm....goodluck :)Vitamin D deficiency can lead to serious health problems. It can even lead to some diseases.- Osteoporosis, sclerosis, bone deformities, hypertension, rickets, fatigue, and depression are just some of the dangers.- Rickets in children are usually caused by vitamin D deficiency.- Bone fragility is possible in both adults and children.- Hypertension is another problem that can get serious.- Vitamin D deficiency can cause diabetes.- Depression is possible in people who lack vitamin D. The worst thing is that a depressive person is usually unaware that low vitamin D levels are to blame for depressive state. As we know, depression can cause many problems and ruin a person\u2019s life, so it must be prevented and treated properly.- Sometimes, a person can become ill, without even knowing that the illness is caused by vitamin D deficiency. This can be very misleading and make the treatment more difficult.- According to some researches, vitamin D is closely related to obesity. It is still unclear whether vitamin D deficiency is a cause or a consequence, but it is clear that there is a connection between these two.- Vitamin D deficiency can also cause serious bone deformities. This is especially hard to treat.If you are diagnosed with vitamin D deficiency, you must start your treatment in time. Vitamin D deficiency is treated with orally taken supplements or injections of vitamin D. Sometimes, the dose can be very high, but it all depends on how serious your condition is. You must never change the dose without your doctor\u2019s knowledge. Vitamin D overdose is very rare, so you should not worry about getting overdosed. Remember, it is very important that you check your vitamin D levels in time",
