    "question": "Hi so recently I've been vomiting. A lot. It starts with me getting a lot of flem in the back of my throat to the point I have to vomit. If I move around too much I will vomit almost all my stomach's contents out. It also triggers if I eat greasy foods, however I've cut almost all greasy foods out and I'm still having the same problem. I have also noticed that my mid range abdomen seems...bloated? It feels like there's a...bump there or something, like I feel full but I just threw up. I'm planning on going to see my doctor about it but I can't go until at least november 1st and I'd like to get an idea of what's wrong in the meantime. Here are some details about my medical history.-Diagnosed with type 1 diabetes at age ten. Less than normal control recently since loss of insurance forced me to resort to last gen insulin.-40lbs overweight. I've cut foods and other unhealthy things out recently but it just doesn't seem to be working well.-High Blood Pressure. I'm on lisinopril, but a low ammount.-Mostly sedentary. Most of my time I spend seated, but I'm a security guard and the rest of the time consists of me walking 30 minutes to an hour multiple times a day.-Brain Damage. I went into a diabetic coma when diagnosed and a doctor shoved the breathing tube into the back of my brain instead down my throat. I've been on prozac and have been fine since. This was when I was ten, (25 now).Any other questions I can answer I will. Thank you for reading and I hope you can answer my question. Good day.",
