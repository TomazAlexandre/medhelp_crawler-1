    "question": "Hi guys, im hoping someone can give me some sort of an idea whats going on with my health, 2 years ago i noticed a wrinkled patch on both temples of my head which look like acne scar thogh ive never had acne, over the 2 years they have grown slightly larger, then about 4 months ago i started getting like a burning feeling in my toes and a crawling sensation over my face and the insides of my mouth feel thick to the touch of my tongue, i am also experiencing dry mouth and eyes and blurred vision in my left eye as if it is short sighted, as well as this my stomach is constantly rumbling for over a year now as well, the doctor has ruled out ms and diabetes, i am currently waiting to see a neuroligist, any info would be kindly appreciated, many thanks",
