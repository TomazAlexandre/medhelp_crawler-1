            "answer": "Yes, I did call back. They said this happens sometimes when the patient hasn't eaten before the procedure, or if the patient is tense for some reason, or even the way that I was sitting on the chair makes the nerve more sensitive since it could be the same nerve that goes in the arm and leg.So no input from you - but thanks anyway :-)",

It could be that my blood pressure was a little higher or I was tense that morning.Now I'm all worried that maybe I have an underlying condition like diabetes, that can cause local anesthetics to act up like that.",
