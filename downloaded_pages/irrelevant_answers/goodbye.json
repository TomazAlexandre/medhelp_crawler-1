    "question": "My protective, loyal, loving, sweet miniature dachshund, Buster, passed away today at age 12.\u00a0\u00a0He had been the picture of health until about a year ago when he suddenly put on weight.\u00a0\u00a0The vets couldn't find anything wrong during monthly visits then, about 5 months ago, he developed sever, uncontrollable diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In the past 5 weeks he has been in the ICU 6 times.\u00a0\u00a0I have been cooking for him, controlling his die, giving him 2x daily insulin injections, giving him his thyroid meds, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He was great yesterday then refused too eat this morning.\u00a0\u00a0I rushed him to the vet.\u00a0\u00a0His glucose was (again) too high to read.\u00a0\u00a0He went into cardiac arrest just as they were finishing the blood test.\u00a0\u00a0They put him on a ventilator, shocked him, and had two IVs in then they came out and had me go into the OR.\u00a0\u00a0There I had to make the most heartbreaking decision of my life.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to kiss him and pet his head while the vet put him out of his misery.They let me hold him after and I have opted to have him cremated with his favorite toy, a pheasant he always wanted at the hospital with him.\u00a0\u00a0My children, boyfriend, and two other dogs are in mourning too.He was an amazing dog and can never be replaced.Give your babies an extra hug from me today!",
