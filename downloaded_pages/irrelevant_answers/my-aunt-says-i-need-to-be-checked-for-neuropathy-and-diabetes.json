            "answer": "Something of your nature needs hands-on medical examination. It can be diabetes, peripheral neuropathy or from numerous other causes. Get off the computer and go see a doctor asap. BTW, neuropathy can lead to amputation.In the meantime try not to sit for too long in one position. Elevate your feet above the level of your heart at the first indication of swelling. Use ice for 20 minutes to reduce swelling too. Good luck",

            "answer": "Hi there,If you wanna know if you are a diabetic or not. To me the easiest\u00a0\u00a0and inexpensive way is to buy a self-test kit for diabetes called A1C Now, made by Bayer, available at Wal-mart or Walgreens for about $25 USD. I use this brand many times and find them VERY accurate and reliable.To see a regular\u00a0\u00a0medical practionner aka\u00a0\u00a0regular doctor for\u00a0\u00a0diabetes diagnosis is a waste of time and money because most of them know very little\u00a0\u00a0about diabetes. Period, This is just my own opinion. Good luck",

            "answer": "Two things came to mind after reading your last post, pansiesforme. One is having a hypothyroid, a low or under-active thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism is known to cause cold feet/legs. A simple TSH test can check for this. The other is circulation problems.While you're waiting you might think about posting on both MH Thyroid Disorder forums. Also, be sure to write down all medications and supplements you take then hand the list over to your doctor for review.Lastly, diabetic neuropathy is not inherited, it is self created. Be sure to tighten up your glucose control and management by making those necessary lifestyle changes.",
