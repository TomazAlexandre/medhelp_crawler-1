            "answer": "the metformin should definately help, especially since your dose is being titrated.\u00a0\u00a0That being said, you should be closely monitored by your provider.\u00a0\u00a0Your glucose levels that you report are VERY high considering a fasting goal of 80-120 and postprandial (2hrs after you eat) goal of less than 140.\u00a0\u00a0You really need to be referred to a Registered Dietitan (preferably one that is a Certified Diabetes Educator or \"CDE\").\u00a0\u00a0If your blood sugar is not under control after 1 month of intervention (diet/exercise/meds), you may want to consider seeing an endocrinologist who can help you fine tune your meds.",

    "question": "I`ve lost 30 pounds in the last 3 months without wanting to.I`ve just been diagnosed diabetic type 2, but unlike most diabetics who are trying to lose weight, I want to STOP losing weight, mainly because a lot of it is muscle - don`t mind the fat going, but I want to keep the muscle :-)My new meter shows my blood sugar levels are pretty high (average about 450 or 27-ish, tho` have been off the scale of the meter once or twice..So I have to watch the carbs, but is there any reason why I should not start eating a lot more meat to stop losing muscle? losing 4\" off thighs and 3\" off biceps is no fun.Any other suggestions?As I understand it my insulin is ok at the moment but my body is not communicating with my blood and not taking nourishment from it.I`m 200 pounds now (over 6 foot)Sorry if this is the wrong forum but I don`t see a type 2 diabetes forum.",
