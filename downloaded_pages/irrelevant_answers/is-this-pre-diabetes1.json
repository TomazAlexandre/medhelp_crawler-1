            "answer": "\"my blood sugar level just came back at 122\"Depends on when you obtained this result. If preprandial fasting [usually 1st thing in morning b4 eating], the answer is yes, prediabetes. If postprandial [2-3 hours after a meal], the answer is highly unlikely. Random testing is useless as it only gives false/positives.Losing just a few pounds through exercise and eating well can help with preventing diabetes. Others on this forum can attest to attributing their rapid weight loss to a reduction in carbohydrate food intake. See this for low carb eating http://www.atkins.com/Homepage.aspx\u00a0\u00a0Good luck",

If your A1c is between 5,6% to 6.4% than you area pre-diabetic 2 according to Dept. of Health.Good luck.",
