            "answer": "With gestational diabetes, mom's pancreas is working overtime - although ineffectively - to produce insulin in an attempt to lower blood sugar. This additional maternal insulin doesn't cross the placenta, but the increased amount of glucose does! This in turn makes baby's pancreas produce additional insulin, which can decrease baby's blood sugar after devliery.But, the bottom line is that baby is getting more energy than it needs in the form of glucose, and that extra energy is stored as fat, making for a baby that has macrosomia - or a baby weighing over 4000 grams, or around 9 pounds.Babies with macrosomia face health problems of their own, including shoulder dystocia during birth. This means baby is so big, birth of it's shoulders is very difficult. Because of the extra insulin made by the baby's pancreas, baby may have very low blood glucose levels at birth. These babies are also at risk for respiratory problems.Your doctor wants to induce you a little early to try and lessen the potential for these problems. It's all in your and your baby's best interest, and most importantly, the standard of care for mothers with your same condition. It's the medically responsible thing to do.Hope this helps. Don't be afraid to talk to your doctor. He's your best resource, and it's his job to explain your plan of care to your satisfaction.",

    "question": "Does having gd always lead to an induction? My ob said the other day that he'll probably want to induce me at 39 weeks unless i go into labor on my own. Is this that norm? He actually said if i wanted he'd induce at 38 weeks but I'd rather keep her cooking as long as possible. He just made it sound like i didn't have a choice about the 39 week induction!",
