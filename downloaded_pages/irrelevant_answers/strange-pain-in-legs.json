            "answer": "-- Sounds as though you may have answered your own question about what could be wrong. Sitting for long periods of time, combined with cigarette use could contribute to P.A.D. - peripheral artery disease. My daughter has the same problems. My advice to her was to make certain she got up and moved continuously for as long as possible each day - but no less that 20 minutes each day. Due to her weight problems, along with her inactivity, she has also developed non-insulin dependent diabetes as well. So many issues can arise just from a lack of movement. Take care of yourself!",

    "question": "Hi! My name is Brandi,I am 24and I sit a lot during the day. A Lot! i have also been a heavy smoker for the past 5 years. and for the past few months i have been having these strange pains in the calves of my legs, every once in a while it will be in my thigh as well. It first started about a year ago, but the pains where in both legs and my arms. The arm pain has gone away for the most part, but the pain in my calves have gotten worse. It is very hard to describe the pain. I will say that it does not seem to be a muscle pain or anything like that because walking or stretching has no effect on the pain.. It almost feels like my veins. It is not a severe pain but an achy dull pain that can get severe at times. Nothing i do seems to help the pain. I thought it may have been blood clots, but there is no swelling, redness, or bruising. Just pain. Does anyone have any clue what this is, or what could be causing this? I currently am unemployed and am trying to find any help or suggestions before spending the money to go to a doctor. Any advice is greatly appreciated!",
