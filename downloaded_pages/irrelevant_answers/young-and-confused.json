            "answer": "Set up some time to talk with your doctor. Your weight could be the cause of the problem. It can cause your body to make more insulin and that can lead to many of your symptoms.The doctor might want to draw some blood tests in the morning before you eat or drink anything (while you are fasting). He/she might get insulin and glucose (sugar) levels, and blood tests for testosterone, estradiol, LH and FSH. There are several medications that can help, though some do not prevent you from getting pregnant. Others like the birth control pill can help the symptoms and prevent pregnancy. But your best bet is to lose weight. Even losing 10 to 15 pounds can make a big difference and help you live longer and healthier.Machelle M. Seibel, MD",
