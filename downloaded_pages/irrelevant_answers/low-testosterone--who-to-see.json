    "question": "Hi, my husband has mild depression, low sex drive, soft erections, desesatization (which makes it harder for him to achieve orgasm), gained fat around his middle, more tired, but doesn't sleep well, loss of muscle mass, acne on his back, low sperm count, low sperm mobility, and he's had benign enlarged prostate and frequent urination at night. Plus he no longer has morning erections. These symptoms have developed one at a time over the yrs and has grown worse with age. He is 44 and 8 mths ago his testerone level was 437, 3mths ago it was 370, however our g.p. is female and has only mentioned \"possibly\" giving him shots, but has not persued it. I've done some research and a few specialist or clinics say it's Andropause or (male menopause) and they are very expensive as they don't file insurance and they say he would need extra med's if we still want to have children.....What to do???? Advice??? Right now they gave him an anti-depressant and viagra which is like pouring gas on a fire and water at the same time.....Thanks for any info. and if you know of a specialist we live in the south and would be willing to drive.",
