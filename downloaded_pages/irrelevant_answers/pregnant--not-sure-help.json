            "answer": "I've been experiencing pregnancy syptoms for the past 3 weeks. My last PMS was on Jan. 30 and lasted for 4 days. I believe I was o'd on the 13th of Feb. and have been feeling tired, feels sleepy in the afternoon but sleepless at night, my breast feels tense at times but mostly at bedtime. I feels cramp, headaches, dizziness and bloated. I did blood test last friday but came back negative on monday. I did a home pregnancy test on wednesday, also negative. Thursday morning after using the toilet i wiped I can see a light pink color on the tissue. I put the pad on before going to work. When I get to work, went to the restroom I spotted a very brownish-black discharged and nothing else througthout the day. When I got home I wiped I can see the brown color on the tissue, this time is a bit different, it look like jelly and gross. I suppose to get my period today and very heavy but that hasn't happen yet. Just\u00a0\u00a0a small brown spot. This whole evening I feel sick like having a fever and dizzy. Could I still be pregnant??? Please help.",

            "answer": "Sounds like early symptoms of diabetes, especially the huge need for water- thirst is a big indicator of diabetes- definitely get a blood test, the tiredness sounds like a symptom too- my mother has diabetes and if she doesn't take medicine at night she's awful tired in the morning and can't get a good start in the day until she eats something but it's because her blood sugar is way low by morning, also sometimes too many carbs before you go to bed at night can cause your body to tire out trying to break them all down if you have diabetes- BLOOD TEST IMMEDIATELY Seriously go to the dr",
