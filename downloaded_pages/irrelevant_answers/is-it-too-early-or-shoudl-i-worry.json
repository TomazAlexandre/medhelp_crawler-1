    "question": "My wife and I went to Dr, she had vag U/S and doc said had hb of 70 it should be in 80-100 range. They are not sure the exact time she conceived, they say she is somewhere between 5w & 7w, Dr scheduled another vag U/S for next week. We have 2 kids already, but she is worried that since she is high risk (prev gest. diabetes 2x, thyroid disorder, 40) that it will turn out bad. Hard to stay encouraged, anyone shed some light on situation or something positive to keep spirits up?",
