            "answer": "Hi!Since you have recurrent bronchitis like features, extreme fatigue and joint pains, cystic fibrosis should be thought of as a possibility. COPD and asthma, diabetes, and hypothyroidism are the other possibilities. It could also be due to severe anemia and rheumatoid arthritis. Since a confirmed diagnosis cannot be given on net please consult your treating doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi all. I'm 27 yrs old and about 6 months ago I was diagnosed with a lupus like autoimmune disease.\u00a0\u00a0My pain symptoms are terrible joint pain hair loss and extreme fatigue. What lead to me being diagnosed was a terrible respiratory infection that put me in the hospital for 5 days. I am currently on prednisone, plaquenil and imuran.\u00a0\u00a0I guess my main question is am I the only one that gets chronic bronchitis.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime I turn around I have bronchitis again and am back on antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know what to do. I can't miss any more work but feel terrible.\u00a0\u00a0I am sick again after just finishing two rounds of antibiotics less than a week ago.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions??? I am so new to this that any advice will be greatly appreciated.",
