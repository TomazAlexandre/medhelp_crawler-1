I included some sites for you to read.I have read its important to first get them calibrated for cats by comparing the Vets reading with your own at home. the one most recommended is the Accu-Check Aviva and its avail thru Amazon for abt $20...I've read that Vet glucometers can have an upward bias as much as 20-30 pts. I've also read that human and cats parameters are the same.....I will Pm you with more info...welcome and keep us informed, I give you one heck of alot of credit for sticking by this kitty, he must be very special to you. you are a great kitty mommy and we hope you'll stay with all us kitty mommies on this site...\u2665I have read that cats and humans have the same range....",

            "answer": "Don't give up on your sweet kitty. I had a diabetic cat for years. Controlling the diet and making sure the eat right after giving insulin, and mine took human insulin, was of utmost importance. I am wondering if he doesn't also have a urinary tract infection going on at the same time causing the mishaps and urinating all over the place. I had several vets that wanted to put my cat Koa down immediately because of the diabetes, and many would not even give me the time of day without a $2000.00 deposit. I found a wonderful loving vet but it was in Hawaii at a place called Blue Cross Animal Hospital. They took my Koa and kept him for approximately 2 months while working to stabilize his blood sugar and get him back on his feet. He became the best diabetic patient that you could have ever wished for even letting you know when he felt he needed his injections and standing very still for me to give it to him. He was priceless to me. Please have them make sure their is nothing bothering his urethra as far as a infection, blockage, irritation, etc. I wish you all the luck in the world and will keep you and your kitty in my thoughts and prayers. I just joined this website and if you would like to message me please do. ~kanga1427",

            "answer": "I have a diatetic kitty on Lantus, and yes, you can use the human glucometer.\u00a0\u00a0I use the Alpha Trak meter, which is an animal meter, but it is quite pricey, and it reads 30 points higher, so her range is anywhere between 70 - 160.\u00a0\u00a0The human meter ranges would be lower.\u00a0\u00a0I home test her - it is important to know what the blood glucose is before giving insulin, as you know.\u00a0\u00a0I learned everything about home testing from the people experienced with diabetic kitties on this site.\u00a0\u00a0Just type in www.felinediabetesd.com and look for Lantus (Glargine) links.\u00a0\u00a0If you could check around and ask for a Vet who is experienced with home testing, it would be better.\u00a0\u00a0Most Vets for some reason don't encourage home testing, but without it is like testing blind.\u00a0\u00a0 Sorry for typos, as I'm in a rush.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of luck and I'll check back.www.felinediabetes.comIf you click on the Message board for Lantus glargine insulin, it will bring you to the message board on Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0I'm getting ready to take my kitty to the Vet for a dental, so won't have too much more time here.\u00a0\u00a0I'll try and get this other link directly to Lantus message board.\u00a0\u00a0I give Maggie Lantus every 12 hours,The links are hard for me to figure out how to post here, but here it is:http://www.felinediabetes.com/FDMB/viewforum.php?f=9Hugs and you can do it - feline diabetes is not a death sentence.",

            "answer": "yes as I mentioned in the PM, FLUTD or a UTI is very possible, Lickity should have an urinalysis done and check for crystals...when crystals are present they 'hurt' so kitties naturally 'tell' you it hurts by inappropriate elimination....samples need to be a fresh catch otherwise crystals will naturally show up if it sits for more than a half hour, so if you can do your own catch and take it in where you'll be sure it IS TESTED right away thats good, otherwise take kitty in for the urinalysis. Be sure he's on CANNED food, never dry for a male or crystals will eventually appear, they are very painful and can also lead to a blockage...\u2665Opus",

            "answer": "Hi, I am in agreement with both of you concerning the UTI and possible crystal formation. It is especially a problem for male cats, and I have had more than one that has suffered with that problem. There is a great prescription that helps dissolve the crystals, but as an emergency I have used Cranberry Capsules to help change the ph in the urine, puncturing the OTC capsules at the highest dose I can buy and giving it to my cat in an oral syringe instead of trying to make him swallow the capsules. It greatly helps with my mom's cat that has\u00a0\u00a0this problem. I have had one Maine Coon in the past who had such bad crystal formation that the vet did surgery to correct the problem, but mostly it is controlled with meds and sometimes as you would know as a nurse they will catherize them to help him urinate if he is severely blocked, without having to resort to surgery. His problem was extremely severe and constantly being catherized causing scar tissue to build up in that tiny urethra. I am hoping that you will be able to get this solved with your precious cat. I also worried about the one dose without checking the blood sugar levels. That is what the vet also had me do, and I was very willing to monitor it for him. But they worry that most people will not be able to accomplish this task. As a nurse you would be more than qualified. I found that I had to make sure that if I gave him insulin that he was prepared to eat, and everything that he wanted was on demand and catered to, but truly he was a perfect patient and lived for many years without to many problems after diagnosed and stabilized. He will always be extra special to me, and I made sure that I took him back to show the other vets who were so ready to give up on him and have him put down. I told them with the right vet that truly cares about animals...miracles do happen. I have loved reading the other comments here. I just joined this group and am very glad to have found it. Thank you. Most sincerely, Kanga",

    "question": "I have a diabetic cat, \"Lickety Split\", that is on 5 units 2X/day of Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0He has been urinating all over our home for the past two years.\u00a0\u00a0Despite the exhausting amount of methods I have read or been advised to do, the inappropriate elimination has continued and we have had to tear up carpets, throw out items, constant every day cleaning soiled areas....\u00a0\u00a0Two years ago, I had questioned whether it might be diabetes because of s/s he was displaying.\u00a0\u00a0My vet said Lickety's urine showed high glucose levels, but that his blood did not, so he ruled out diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The vet said he had to be put on a special prescription diet.\u00a0\u00a0I bought the expensive food from the same vet for another year until next annual with no relief of the s/s.\u00a0\u00a0I again suggested diabetes to a different vet at the same office, and was told yes.\u00a0\u00a0I asked about the previous tests and this vet said, \"Well, it could have been called either way, possibly with further testing.\"\u00a0\u00a0My cat stayed at the vets for three days to find \"correct\" dosage of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0I was told to give him 1 unit of the Lantus and come back in a week for the day for the Glucose Curve test.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin was increased to 1 1/2 units and told to come back in a month for GC.\u00a0\u00a0This keeps going by 1/2 unit increases.My questions are: 1) I am an RN can I accurately measure his blood glucose with a human glucometer (I was told by our vet, \"Oh no, we have certain instruments that we use on pets.\")\u00a0\u00a02) It has cost me approximately $1200 between the 3-day initial glucose monitoring visit, the monthly glucose curve visits, insulin.... Do veterinarian offices not have the similar meds or methods to gradually increase unit dosages, as well as the meds to counter, such as D5 or D50 while monitoring for the day?\u00a0\u00a0The reason I ask is because on my last visit, when they said he was ready to go, I asked what his blood sugar was and they told me it was 310 mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0I asked what is the range for cats thinking it must be drastically different than humans if he was okay to go at 310mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0When they said 70 -110 mg/dl after being there all day, and they had only increased 1/2 unit each month,\u00a0\u00a0I was surprised because they said he was okay to go at 4PM at that range and to give him another dose at 9PM., I thought there must be a different range for cats.He does not seem to be getting any better, in fact, he seems worse with a recent bloody red rectal area (which I cleared up) but now the fur around his urethral area is always noticeably wet, he's drinking lots of water, frequent urination and constantly cleaning the area.I know this may be a long and arduous note to get through, but I am at my breaking point.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to put him down, I can't bear the thought of being the one to decide his fate, but my home is being ruined and family members are upset because their belongings are getting ruined or \"smell of cat pee.....\"Thank you, Lickety Split's Mom",
