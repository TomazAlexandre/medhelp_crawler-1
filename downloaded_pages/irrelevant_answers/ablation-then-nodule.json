            "answer": "Many of us have nodules on your thyroid and, typically, they are nothing to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0If you've had an ultrasound, which didn't show any unusual characteristics or anything, I'd agree with your doctor that it's nothing to worry about.Are you being tested for anything, other than TSH?\u00a0\u00a0You should be getting tested for Free T3 and Free T4, every time you have a TSH test.\u00a0\u00a0If you have those results, please post them, along with reference ranges, which vary lab to lab and have to be posted with results.It takes 4-6 weeks for a dosage change to reach full potential, so if you were just increased yesterday, your new dosage won't have had a chance to have any effect yet.Your symptoms do indicate hypo, so once we see your FT3 and FT4 levels, we will be better able to assess your situation. It's possible that you aren't converting the FT4 to FT3 adequately.Do be aware that not all endocrinologists are good thyroid doctors, as many specialize in diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I've no doubt that an endo would tell you the same thing, regarding your nodule.",

            "answer": "Not sure if nodules are \"common\" after ablation, but I\"m sure they aren't unheard of.\u00a0\u00a0If they\u00a0\u00a0have no unusual characteristics, they aren't anything to worry about.\u00a0\u00a0I've got multiple nodules on my thyroid.When you ask for T3/T4 testing, be sure to specify that you want FREE T3 and FREE T4.\u00a0\u00a0Those are not the same as the total T3 and total T4 that a lot of doctors order.Will look forward to seeing labs w/ranges when you get them.",
