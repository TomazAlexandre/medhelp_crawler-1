            "answer": "For the most part when you are pregnant what you eat is more important then how much. Unless you are gaining excessive weight, focus on the nutrition (protein, vitamins,\u00a0\u00a0fiber, etc) not the calories. Just stay away from high sugar and high fat foods and you shouldn't have to worry too much about weight. Eating small, frequent meals is very healthy . I was always snacking when I was pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Just choose healthy veggies, fruit, cheese, granola, etc.",

I don't pay attention to how often I eat or when but I make sure that when I do I include something beneficial. I loooove fiber and fruit but that doesn't mean I won't have a cookie or pizza on occasion. Don't restrict yourself everything is OK in moderation.",

    "question": "Being pregnant, diets are not really encouraged, but when I think of eating right I always have diet in the back of my head as a guideline, like not a lot of bread, don't eat after 8 pm etc. My question is what's the difference? What should I be more cautious of or what is not so costly since I am growing a human being. I ask because I love to eat, lol pregnant or not pregnant. I just want to find a common ground of being satisfied and eating right. Sounds fat? :/ Lol",
