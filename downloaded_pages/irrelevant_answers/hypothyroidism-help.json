            "answer": "Your labs are too old to of any use, now, but your FT3 was very low in the range.\u00a0\u00a0I'd strongly suggest that you get FT3, FT4 and TSH retested.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't waste the money on a Total T4.The range you stated for FT3 as 0.5-4.0, is often used as a range for TSH, not FT3.\u00a0\u00a0Ranges vary lab to lab, here in the U.S. so they have to come from a person's own lab report.\u00a0\u00a0Recommended range for TSH is 0.3-3.0.Was the diabetes test an A1c, with a result of 5.3?\u00a0\u00a0You can have insulin resistance and still have a normal A1c test.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to reverse insulin resistance is with a low glycemic diet.You really need to have 24 hour cortisol testing, which is typically done via saliva testing.\u00a0\u00a0Many doctors won't recognize that test though.\u00a0\u00a0A single cortisol is not real useful.",

    "question": "After suffering with weight problem for years i got my advanced thyroid blood tests about 18months ago after my gp said my tsh was fine. I have every symptom of hypothyroidism except a lump / goiter. I have 3 family members with hypo. I also have a basal temp of way below 97 every morning. My feets espec are always like ice and i can never get warm, and i cant lose weight even with diet and exercise. The normal ranges i quote are that which are stated on the thyroid uk website.My resultstsh = 2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(norm 0.4 - 4.5 )Free thyroxine = 16.1 (norm 10 - 24)Total T4 = 112\u00a0\u00a0( norm 50 -60)Free T3 = 4.7 ( norm 4 - .8.3)Thyroglobulin Antibody = 19.4\u00a0\u00a0(Norm 0-115)Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies =5.2 ( 3.1 -6.8)I know these were 18 months ago and i need new ones, but i read on the thyroid uk site if you have tsh of 2 or over with low basal temps and a fam history hypothyroid you should be considered, then ft3+ ft4's should be checked.Was my ft3 on the low side? ive read on here your norm is 0.5-4, so does that make it high or low? im confused.I was thinking of going back for the tests again but have just started taking a super strength b complex the highest dose you can get, and am worried it could affect the reading?I also had a cortisol 10am reading of 517 the normal range was 50- 530, but this reading should have been taken at 8-9 am as levels drop as the day goes on. this test was taken a month ago. I have been for a 2nd blood test to confirm which im awaiting the results.I also went for a diabetes test last week and gave a reading of 5.3, i was told normal range is 4-.6.2If it wasnt thyroid i was thinking i could have damaged one of my glands as i have had borderline personality disorder for the past 20 years, which means ive been constantly stressed for 20 years, and ive read if youve had higher cortisol for long periods this can happen along with becoming insulin resistant, i also was diagnosed with gluacoma about 2 years ago.An out side thought is PCOS as i do have 3 family members with that too, i have some symptoms, but not the hair.Any thoughts?Thanks",
