            "answer": "Hello,Tingling sensation of the penis can be due to anxiety, contact dermatitis, traumatic damage to the nerves of penis, diabetes etc but they are less likely in your son\u2019s case.I would suggest you to keep the area clean and wear cotton underwears. Also apply a mild steroid cream on the penis. If the symptoms persist then the above said conditions have to be ruled out. Please consult a urologist in that case.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Dear Dr. Kaur, thank you very much for reading and taking time to respond to my concerns. My son has been doing well this last few days without a bad episode of tingling sensation. We live couple of hours away from Mayo Clinic and were thinking about having my son to be seeing by an urologist there.. My husband also suffers from nocturia and perhaps this is a condition that might\u00a0\u00a0affect my son in the future?.. I am not sure about that.I will follow your guidelines and ask the pharmacist for a mild steroid cream.Thank you very much once again and have a good week!",
