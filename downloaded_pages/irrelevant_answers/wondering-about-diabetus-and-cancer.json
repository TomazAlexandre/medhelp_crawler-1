            "answer": "Hi Simplystar. My mother is diabetic. She got it in her 60s. She gives herself insulin shots. My father as I mentioned before--was a cropduster years ago with DDT. He remembers the powder all over himself.Yes these are things that can manifest as DNA mutations. I know the research is endless. I have a file cabinet full of stuff. My memory is not so good to keep up with it all. Keep doing your good research. Heh maybe diabetes does in some way have something to do with another variable. I've always had hypoglycemic problems.

My 3 brothers all were diabetic also and none of them ever develored Ca. Makes me wonder. Can't keep my mind from working on research. My daughter was tested for diabetus and it was not present at the time of her dx. But then I am finding that her Dad's radiation in WW2 might have caused a genetic mutation\u00a0\u00a0and thus the Ca.",
