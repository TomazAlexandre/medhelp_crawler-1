If test is taken after a meal, it might be around 150.\u00a0\u00a0Look for signs like cracked and dry skin on the heels of your feet, the color of the urine (clear means sugar usually), and the frequency of dry mouth.TIPS:Drink about 1/2 gal of water per day.\u00a0\u00a0But, not all at once.\u00a0\u00a0The body can only absorb so much at any one time.Packaged and processed foods should not comprise more than 30% of the diet... in my opinion, this is probably too much.Get as much rest/sleep as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Sleep deprivation impairs the body's ability to heal itself.Regular daily exercise of any kind is very important.Chronic or severe stress plays a big role in getting many illnesses.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is no exception.Fresh vegitables and fruits have enzymes we need.\u00a0\u00a0Try eating fresh broccoli with toasted almond slices with some meals.",

            "answer": "Actually the criteria have changed. Anything over 100 for a fasting glucose up to 125 is now considered pre-diabetes. 126 and up is considered diabetic. And yes, 54 is definitely too low for after a meal. So yes, you should get tested (A1C and/or OGTT) and meanwhile you should read up a bit on diabetes and watch for symptoms such as frequent urination and thirst as well as weight loss. But if you are pre-diabetic you might not have any symptoms. Eat regularly, get some exercise and if you have excess weight work on a moderate plan to lose the weight.",
