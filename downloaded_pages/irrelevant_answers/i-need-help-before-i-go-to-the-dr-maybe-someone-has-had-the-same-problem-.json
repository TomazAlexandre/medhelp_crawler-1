            "answer": "I have never blacked out, my I have experienced the symptoms you describe and I have also had anaemia.I would advise that you see your doctor to be checked out.The dizzy feelings and that of lightheadedness, although can be from your blood count being low (you would also feel very tired all the time), another reason for experiencing the symptoms you describe can be from your blood pressure being too high.\u00a0\u00a0High blood pressure can cause headaches and dizzy turns.Ear and sinus and other infections can cause the headaches and dizzy turns too.For your vision I would suggest you get your eyes checked,\u00a0\u00a0as well as the doctor testing you for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you are glucose intolerant or suffer from diabetes that can affect your vision if your sugar levels are too high.Hope you find out soon what is causing these symptoms so that you can be treated accordingly.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "hello,the blurry vision\u00a0\u00a0raises a red flag, for me. Please do see a dr soon ! make a list of your symptoms, so you don't forget anything. Mention all symptoms, even the ones that \"aren't really a bother\"; every symptom is a clue.If you got dizzy when standing up, that may be due to tired adrenals. Normally, when we stand up, our adrenals squirt out some adrenaline to raise the blood pressure a little, to overcome the effect of gravity on our heart. Then when we are standing, things equalise out. So, if you have the blood pressure taken while lying down & relaxed, & then again while in the process of standing up, there should be a rise of about 10 points in blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0If there isn't, or if the blood pressure drops, that indicates your adrenals are tired. Not necessarily \"exhausted\" to the point of being clinically diseased-- but tired; in need of a rest & some good nutrition. Adrenals affect other things too, like thyroid - so please get checked out. And bear in mind there may be more than one problem going on. God bless!",
