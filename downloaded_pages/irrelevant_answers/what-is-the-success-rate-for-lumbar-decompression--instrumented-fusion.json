    "question": "After several years of back pain, I got an Xray and MRI on my back. Two different ortho doctors have recommended lumbar decompression & instrumented fusion. I am always in pain to some degree. Sometimes laid up and can't move for days. They have persuaded me to go ahead with the surgery. It is scheduled for next week 7/8/09. I am wondering what the success rate is for this type of surgery? How long in the hospital and how long to recuperate and be back at work?This discussion is related to/posts/show/698474.",
