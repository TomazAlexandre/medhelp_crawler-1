            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed description or a clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of the lump. Possibilities that may need to be considered include abscesses, cysts, growths/ masses etc. If there is an infection suspected and the anti-biotic isn\u2019t helpful, it is advised to run a culture and sensitive and change the antibiotic to a sensitive one or with increased infection surgical drainage may be required. I would suggest getting this examined by a primary care physician or a dermatologist for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

They are not hard, but very soft, and they are there when I am mostly standing. When I lay down, I do not see them. What can they be coming from?",
