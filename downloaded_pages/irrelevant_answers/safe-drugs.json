I know it is not always possible at time of evaluation but your doctor should have outside office contact via email or direct phone line, bypassing the front office nursing staff. You may want to ask for another drug.\"..my sugar is not out of control and my numbers are always under 175.\"I don't know what makes you feel this way but your numbers are out of control. If they don't fall into the normal category range, fasting and postprandial, there are out of control. Pay strict attention to food types by avoiding \"white\" foods - potatoes, pasta, white bread, crackers, white rice, etc - as these quickly enter your blood stream as sugar. Carbohydrates and dairy products too. Good luck -",

    "question": "I have diabetes ll. My doctor has given me Actos 30 mg. I have been hearing a lot about this drug and none of it's good, saying long term use causes bladder cancer. My last A1c was 6.1 although now due for another one. I'm not sure the risk involved with this drug is worth the benefits as my sugar is not out of control and my numbers are always under 175. Is Actos a safe drug to use??",
