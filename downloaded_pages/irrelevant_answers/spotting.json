            "answer": "Hello!Spotting before your expected date of periods can be due to several causes. This spotting can be suggestive of implantation bleeding .This spotting occurs when the fetus attaches to the wall of the uterus. Take up urine pregnancy test if you do not get your periods in a couple of days. If the urine pregnancy test is negative there are several other possibilities like hormonal imbalances, abnormalities in the uterus and the reproductive tract like uterine polpys, endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, infection, cancer etc.Systemic conditions like thyroid disease and diabetes can also cause spotting and menstrual irregularities. To find out the cause of your bleeding it is necessary to have a doctor examine you. Hope it helps.Take care and regards!",
