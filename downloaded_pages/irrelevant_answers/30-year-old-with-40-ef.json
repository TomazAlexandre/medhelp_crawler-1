            "answer": "Hi i had a virus attack my heart at 27 and mine EF was at 25% . Now 7months later its back up to 45% with medicine and diet. I go to the cleveland clinic and there awesome there. I also just started taking COQ10 it's for the heart and i have the GNC kind but research it and only take pills that get approved on consumerlabs.com. Just wait and see the doctor and just take it easy until then, 40% is below the normal 55% but its not that bad. Hope that helped.",
