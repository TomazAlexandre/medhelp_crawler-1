            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since kidney function is normal and there is no diarrhea and vomiting, other causes will have to be looked into. Since your father is overweight this could be a case of low sodium due to increased volume of water in body. If the urine specific gravity is low then diabetes insipidus should be thought of and tested. Second possibility is hypothyroidism, adrenal insufficiency and even pituitary suppression. Your father needs to consult an endocrine specialist. Take care!",
