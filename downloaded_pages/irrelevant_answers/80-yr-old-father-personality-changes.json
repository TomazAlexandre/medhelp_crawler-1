    "question": "My father has been doing strange things we think now for about the last 2 to 20 years!\u00a0\u00a0He fabricates stories, adds to others, and has all of us siblings up in arms because he tells one that the other said unkind things about them that we didn't, or he just makes up something some of us are supposed to have done and tells everyone in our family one at a time.\u00a0\u00a0He is never wrong; and gets pretty irritated if you correct him..some of us have harbored some pretty initense feelings against the other because of things he has said that have turned out to not be true.\u00a0\u00a0His Mother was definitly an NPD; based on research we have done, and a sibling that I personally think has NPD...the difference in my father is that he is full of empathy it seems for all kinds of people, and has always been a rock when we go through sad times...he has had diabetes we think for like 20 years because by the time he was diagnosed, he already had full blown neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Can the blood sugar levels, personality changes be dementia, or a personality disorder, or just radical signs of aging?\u00a0\u00a0He will never tell these stories around our Mother and if he does, he will shush her if she says anything different.\u00a0\u00a0I tend to think he knows what he is doing on some level, others think he is losing his memory.\u00a0\u00a0He eats horribly; doesn't take care of himself as a diabetic, doesn't think he should have to and I wonder if the blood sugar levels which are 37 - 200 are causing havoc on his brain?",
