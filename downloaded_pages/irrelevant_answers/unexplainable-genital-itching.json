            "answer": "Hi,Your symptomatology suggests that either it could be scabies infection or Pruritis ani or allergic contact dermatitis.Pruritis ani is intense chronic itching in the anal and perianal skin. Usual course is acute in nature. Chronic pruritus ani is a symptom, not a diagnosis or disease.For pruritis ani you can treat predisposing factors, such as parasites, diabetes, liver disease, cryptitis, scabies, Pediculosis. Resist overly meticulous use of soap and rubbing. Avoid tight clothing and under clothing. Cleanse anal area after bowel movements with moistened absorbent cotton and plain water; baby wipes may be a convenient alternative. Dust anal area with non-medicated talcum powder. If unable to completely empty rectum with defecation, use small plain water enema (infant bulb syringe) after each bowel movement. This may prevent post evacuation soilage and irritation.You can consult a dermatologist for further reference and evaluation.Keep me posted.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,If the itching and the rash do not involve the anal region then the diagnosis of pruritis ani is void.It might be allergic contact dermatitis.You should be taking anti-histaminic orally and local application of steroid ointment should help.Keep me informed if you have any queries.Bye.",
