    "question": "mother has had diarrhea the last couple years, following recovery from diabetes episode. i don't know much else. she goes say twice a day, doesn't have to run for it but still sometimes concerned about going out of the house a bit...6 years ago she had a eye misdiagnosis, had the wrong prednisone treatment, got depression after that, and then the diabetes imbalance after that, probably due to all the stress.she pretty much recovered according to lab results, but the diarrhea has persisted. she's cut out soy, fruit, rice, all sorts of things - no avail - so gone back onto them; doesn't seem to be diet...i think it's related to the diabetes endocrinology. she has seen an endo and at least one gastroenterologist, and a dietitician, her gp/ pc seems uselessnin this regard - they all are..!?this can't be good for herpls help, anyone.she is already (always has been) very slight build and there must be something causing it!p. s. she went on a boat cruise at new yr for 8 or so days and the diarrhea seemed to improve vastly during that time; she of course tried to recreate the menu but hasn't been able to repeat the results!any clues please :/ thanks",
