            "answer": "Hi,actually my endo has always suspected a problem and has always been regularly testing, but my levels at that time were good.\u00a0\u00a0Fasting 70 - 80 and after eating around 100.Then I got pregnant with my daughter about 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I got pregnant I did the glucose tolerance test and failed, though the levels for pregnancy are much more stringent that for non-pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Targets during pregnancy are fasting < 95 and after eating < 120.\u00a0\u00a0 I couldn't control it well with diet and was put on insulin at about 3 months pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Had excellent control with HA1C during pregnancy of 4.8.Following my daugher's birth and up until the last couple of months fasting levels are nearly always 80 - 95 and after eating < 120.The last few weeks of monitoring my FBS is\u00a0\u00a0usually 100 - 120, never < 95.\u00a0\u00a0After eating is sometimes 110 - 120, but I am also getting numbers of 140 - 160.\u00a0\u00a0This is particularly after breakfast if I eat any carbs at all.So its not yet 'bad', but definitely is getting worse.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, I am losing weight - about 5 kg so far - and exercising daily now.....\u00a0\u00a0my current weight is 79 kg.\u00a0\u00a0Target would be about 65 kg.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the details, Sally. I don't know much about GD but looked it up in a book and it said it can be a precursor of LADA as well as Type 2. Your increase in numbers, weight loss (if you're not dieting) and thyroid certainly seem to indicate LADA. I weighed about the same as you do now until I started losing and lost a total of 40 pounds before and in the year after diagnosis. I will be very interested to hear the results of your tests!",

    "question": "Hi (update to Zoela),I've found a box marked antiGAB on my Endo's test sheet.\u00a0\u00a0That's the antibody to test for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0So I plan to tick it.\u00a0\u00a0Then I'll write in C-peptide as well.\u00a0\u00a0(Can do that sort of thing here - noone cares as long as you pay for the tests - no insurance for this stuff either).\u00a0\u00a0If I remember right, my first endo did a c-peptide test many years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I remember that it was in normal range.\u00a0\u00a0Would love to find it for comparison.Anyway, I need to retest some other stuff in 3 weeks time.\u00a0\u00a0So I'll do them both as well and know for sure.\u00a0\u00a0IF anything interesting comes up I'll present it to my endo when I see him. He's pretty cool and even takes suggestions (he asked me to test FBS, but I asked him to change it to HA1C, which he did).Blood sugar control (with diet and exercise) seems to be getting rapidly poorer, though mostly right on the border between diabetic and prediabetic (but when it's not it's over).\u00a0\u00a0I won't be able to go much longer without meds.....Reckon the 1.5 or maybe pituitary related (I have pituitary microadenoma that is known to be prolactin secreting, and hypothyroid may be secondary).",
