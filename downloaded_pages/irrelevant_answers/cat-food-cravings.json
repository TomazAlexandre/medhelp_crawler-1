    "question": "My cat has been diagnosed as a diabetic. I began giving him insulin (vetsulin) and feeding him only wet food. He now has a bizarre craving for food. He eats six cans of wet food everyday and he craves more all of the time. I could feed him 12 cans and he'd still want more. I took him back to the vet and told him that I give him one uint of vetsulin twice a day (just like he recommended) and he did some tests on him. The results were that his diabetics is just so-so and that he had a low test result for thyroids. I now give him a half pill twice a day for thyriod and the same vetsulin, and his craving has, if anything, gotten a lot worse. He's now trying to eat the food out of the can before I can get it on his plate. Any ideas? Thanks",
