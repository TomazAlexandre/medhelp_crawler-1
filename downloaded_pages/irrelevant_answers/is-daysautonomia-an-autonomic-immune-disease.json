            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your daughter. Dysautonomia is the dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system, which is not under our conscious control and regulates things like heart rate, movement of the gut (peristalsis), respiratory rate, sweating, bladder contraction, etc. While it is not an autoimmune disorder, it can be the result of an autoimmune disorder or a combination of them. It can also be a genetic problem or a result of diabetes, or degenerative neurological diseases (eg. Parkinson\u2019s) or connective tissue disorder (again an autoimmune disorder), or spinal cord injury.First the cause has to be found out and the symptoms have to be properly understood. Then a combination of drugs have to tried by trial and error to find which works the best. Yes, a neurologist can help you. However, it is best to work with a team of cardiologist and neurologist working together. Also, there is no easy solution to symptoms. It has to be by trial and error. Also, it is important to find out whether she has an autoimmune disorder or diabetes and to treat them if she has. Treating the disorders can also bring a lot of relief to her symptoms. Take care!",
