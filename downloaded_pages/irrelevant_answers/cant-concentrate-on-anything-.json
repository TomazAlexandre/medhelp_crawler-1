            "answer": "Hi Seadog, go have a checkup as you may have low testostirone, men often at your age need a boost.Also it does not appear that you are content with what you are doing in life. Have you ever thought of delving more into your creative side and coming up with a product or invention of some kind. On line retailers are always looking for new products. Im doing it now and once you get one started, other ideas come naturally.",

    "question": "Hello, for the past say 2 years my concentration levels have been dropping, also i'm finding it hard to remember words & understand words,fairly complicated ones also how to spell as well plus that i used to be able to just think of naturally but i now i find myself stopping mid sentence regularly as i can't think of the words to say. I'm tired nearly all day even after a good sleep. I find that i can't concentrate on anything either, which may be due to my lack of motivation, i am 41 and i'm currently doing driving lessons, so i have theory test coming up\u00a0\u00a0ill sit down, get everything in order but then i won't be able to concentrate on it at all, i'll go off task or just stare at my book. Then i'll get really sad and annoyed that i haven't done anything and i'll try and try to work but nothing comes of it. I've also gained weight recently and i'm starting to feel down in the evenings. Any help or suggestions of whats wrong would be greatly appreciated, thank you.",
