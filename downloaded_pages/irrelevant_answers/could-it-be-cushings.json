            "answer": "Ask your doctors (an endocrinologist or reproductive endocrinologist) to check for Cushing's and PCOS. I tend to think PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) is more likely the culprit and is a more common.\u00a0\u00a0Go to www.soulcysters.net and check out their website for more info on PCOS and see if your symptoms are similar.Have you had cortisol/ACTH levels tested or an ACTH stimulation test to check for Cushing's or adrenal issues?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had a glucose tolerance test to check for PCOS as well as fasting glucose/insulin levels?\u00a0\u00a0Have you had your sex hormones checked, i.e. FSH, LH, testosterone, free testosterone, DHEA-S, DHEA and an ultrasound of your ovaries?If you still can't figure out what is wrong the I would also ask for thyroid antibodies test (TPO, Thyroglobulin Ab) just to make sure you don't have thyroid issues because sometimes what the doctors say is normal range isn't always.Hope this helps you out some.\u00a0\u00a0I am just a thyroid patient so all this info is from me reading and researching hormones issues.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

    "question": "I am 24 years old (Nearly 25), and I started my periods when I was 13 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I was like perfect clock work until I was 16 (Nearly 17) years old.\u00a0\u00a0I missed 1 period (Thought I was pregnant, doctors confirmed I wasn't).\u00a0\u00a0Ever since then, I've had about 8 periods total.\u00a0\u00a0Between the age of 17 and 18 I gained 100 pounds (I haven't changed my diet ever) I have had a cyst on my ovary that went away with birth control.\u00a0\u00a0When I turned 18 I went through about a year of fertility treatments when I got married.\u00a0\u00a0After 5 years of unprotected sex, still no baby.
