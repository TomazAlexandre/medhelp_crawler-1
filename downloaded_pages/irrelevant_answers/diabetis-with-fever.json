            "answer": "Maybe there's an infection!!! Diabetes can slow down body's ability to fight infection. High blood sugar (glucose) leads to high levels of sugar in your body's tissues. When this happens, bacteria grow and infections can develop more quickly in people with diabetes. Common sites of infection are your bladder, kidneys, vagina, gums, feet, and skin. Early treatment of infections can prevent more serious complications.While most infections in people with diabetes can be successfully treated, you must be able to recognize the symptoms of an infection in order to get proper and effective treatment. Notify your health care provider immediately if you have any of the following symptoms:Fever over 101 degrees F (38.3 degrees C)Sweating or chillsSkin rashPain, tenderness, redness, or swellingWound or cut that won't healRed, warm, or draining soreSore throat, scratchy throat, or pain when swallowingSinus drainage, nasal congestion, headaches, or tenderness along upper cheekbonesPersistent, dry, or moist cough that lasts more than two daysWhite patches in your mouth or on your tongueNausea, vomiting, or diarrheaFlu-like symptoms (chills, aches, headache, or fatigue) or generally feeling \"lousy\"Vaginal itchingTrouble urinating: pain or burning, constant urge, or frequent urinationBloody, cloudy, or foul-smelling urine",
