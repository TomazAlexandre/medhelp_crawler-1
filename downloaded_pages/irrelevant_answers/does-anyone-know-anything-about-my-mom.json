If it is a poison that is causing this, then it would have to be an allergy that the doctors have not discovered yet. Thank you for your help and concern.\u00a0\u00a0:)",

Also are their any female problems? Has she had a complete blood workup? Do you know any of the findings if she did? High cholesterol?? Heart race at all?

            "answer": "Diabetes does predispose one to visual issues so some of your mom's visual issues may be related to diabetes. Physicians recommend frequent eye exams for those with diabetes (usually every 6 months to a year). Eye problems with diabetics are particularly noted among those who have poor control over their blood sugars. If mom hasn't seen an eye doctor recently, perhaps she should. With gallbladder disease, stones can recur and sometimes removal of the entire gallbladder is the only solution.",

You say she had gallstones removed but did she have her gallbladder removed? Yeah hypoglycemia can happen if she is not eating. If her levels are not kept undercontrol those problems will only get worse. I would only focus on her pain as the biggest issue cause that is the one that will correct the others if found out what it is. She should also have an abdominal ultrasound. Her pancreas and liver should be looked at too. But first have her scheduled with a gastrointerologist and then go from there.Good luckPaula",

Stomach will itself go in(contract in). The breathing in(through the nose) will happen automatically. Establish a rhythm and do for upto 30 minutes twice a day.(Max 60 min/day) Not for pregnant women.

    "question": "My mom has been sick with a disease that no doctor can seem to figure out. It has been occuring on and off over the past 7 to 8 years. Her symptoms are nausea, vomiting, fatigue (because she can't keep food down), severe stabbing chest pain that radiates to her back: usually the left side and very seldom the right, and occasional chills and dizziness. PLEASE, IF THERE IS ANYONE THAT YOU KNOW WITH MOST OR ALL OF THESE SYMPTOMS, POST A QUESTION OR COMMENT ABOUT IT IN THIS WEBSITE'S PUBLIC FORUM. She, as well as the rest of her family, is very tired of this illness. It has taken over her life. I am seventeen and a senoir in high school and she hasn't even been able to teach me how to drive yet. Plus she has three other children who really need someone to take care of them after I go to college since I take care of them now and our father is usually working. The doctors and medical specialists are just beginning to think that nothing is wrong with her and that it is just a mental or psychological problem. Even family members are starting to belive this. But I know my mom wouldn't force herself to vomiting or make up the severe pains in her chest and back. She also wouldn't lie in bed all day in pretend \"agony\" while being fully aware of the strain it puts on her son as he does laundry, his homework, his siblings homework, fixes lunches, keeps the younger ones in line, studies for tests, looks for colleges and scholarships (which I desperately need since we aren't\u00a0\u00a0even financially okay), and other things too. So please if you think you have seen anything like this before post it on this site's public forum as soon as possible so that you can help us rid my mom of this illness once and for all.",
