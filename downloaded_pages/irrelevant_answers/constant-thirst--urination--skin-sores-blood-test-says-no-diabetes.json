            "answer": "Your skin problem sounds like psoriasis, you need to put psoriasis cream on it from drugstore or prescription, also use psoriasis shampoo. Better take good vitamins also, it helps.\u00a0\u00a0Get checked for swollen prostrate gland. That can also cause problems with urination.\u00a0\u00a0Could be bladder infection also,",

            "answer": "The urinary problems with yur thirst definitely seem to point to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Dieabetes can also cause sores on the skin and them not to heal quickly.Rather than the blood fast test, the glucose test may give better results.\u00a0\u00a0Also a HgA1c (or HbA1c)\u00a0\u00a0blood test would show the doctor your average sugar levels over a period of 3 months, rather than whether you are diabetic on the day the bloods were taken.\u00a0\u00a0I had a glucose test done and I was found as being glucose intolerant.\u00a0\u00a0Drinking a small swig of the glucose made me extremely thirstly.The other condition that can also affect the urinary flow is prostate problems, so it would be worth getting that checked out.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat a lot of salty and sugary foods, these can make you feel thirsty too.With the dry areas, this, does sound like psoriasis.\u00a0\u00a0Some people only get red blotches, others get dry mounds of skin like you do.\u00a0\u00a0My cousin aged 63 has had it like cauliflower florets.\u00a0\u00a0Hie is on an injection med for it and is like a new person now.If you have not already had yur urine tested, then that may be a good idea to rule out any urinary tract problems.\u00a0\u00a0Or have a blood test for kidney and liver function.You may also be lacking in vitamins and minerals.\u00a0\u00a0The one that I have heard that causes cracking dry skin, especially on the lips is Vitamin B12.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor can do a blood test to see if you are low on that, but you can also buy it at the herbal shop.\u00a0\u00a0These are Vitamin B12 sublingual small tablets that you place 1 under your tongue.Some people do not absorb the Vitamin well in their gut, so it may be worth your doctor checking you out for blood related disorders in connection with low levels of B12.Hope you get sorted out real soon.Best wishes.",

    "question": "Male, 45. I constantly feel thirsty. I keep urinating and can't seem to retain water; however I also have difficulty urinating and in most cases can no longer form a solid stream. My scalp has developed some sores that are not healing. A doctor gave me medicated prescription shampoo to use on my scalp, but it has not improved. He asked if my joints hurt, but I said no. He also had a blood test done, but did not say what it was for, later sending a letter saying my blood was normal. My left elbow has a scaly area similar to alligator skin with raw skin below the top scaly layer that is not healing. I have some smaller similar dried out spots on my knee that never seem to heal that form a exterior dry crust over a raw inner core, but never seem to heal. I've started to get other small crusty dry spots on my skin such as on the back of my knuckles. My lips are usually very dry and often show a layer of dry outer dead skin. When I eat something instead of giving me energy it makes me suddenly tired to the point I have to take a nap. I thought these might be symptoms of diabetes so I had a fasting diabetes test done, but it showed normal results. Last night I was on a stationary bicycle and had to stop to urinate every 7 to 12 minutes, but only urinated small amount each time.",
