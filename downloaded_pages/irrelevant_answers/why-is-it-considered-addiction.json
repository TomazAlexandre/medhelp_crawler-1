            "answer": "Hi Livin....If you are not abusing it at all and only taking whats prescribed or less (100% of the time) then you do not have any addiction problem regarding the Oxys from what I read. You will have withdrawal symptoms for sure whenever you begin to decrease the dosage or stop taking it. That just comes with these types of meds. And who say that these drugs cannot be used for a lifetime? Certain conditions require that type of treatment.",

            "answer": "Hi, my understanding is that if you require medication and use it as prescribed and don't have cravings to produce drug seeking behaviour then you are dependant on the medication but don't have a addiction to the medication.\u00a0\u00a0As a example I use zoloft, I can't stop taking this medication because if I do I will suffer from withdrawals however I use zoloft as prescribed and i don't have any drug seeking behaviour to obtain more then I medically need so rather than being addicted to the zoloft I am dependant on the zoloft.Your situation could be the same as my zoloft situation.Hope this helpsCindy",

            "answer": "Hi There, So sorry about your moms passing and being delt a worrisome disease. I completely agree with the above poster's, but want to add. You may want to look into a non narcotic solution for your condition now, just as a back up. These pills have a way of turning on us and we have to increase the dose, don't feel well anymore while taking, bring on anxiety we never had etc. Just a thought. I too thought I could take forever, but one day I realized I needed them and they didn't help, just kept sickness at bay temp. Your brain dies some weird rationalizations on these opiates. Just my two cents.",

            "answer": "The only thing that I can add to the above is that society doesn't understand how an autoimmune disease can be so painful and limiting- because it's not able to be measured like a temperature or seen like a rash. There is very little \"oh you're here so you feel normal\" gauges when it comes to this kind of thing and it is an unfortunate excused used by many addicts. Some people do abuse the system and complain of pain more extreme than they have to get these drugs. Personally I don't think you are among them for a moment, but that's where this all is coming from. Heck most of the drs I've had are of the opinion that I'm a hypochondriac because my blood results are always \"normal\" and I'm in there \"complaining\". There is no limit to the judgmental looks; they can come from anyone and they're going to happen. The only advice I can offer you is document everything in your medical history -when you feel good vs when you can't move (this will help if they ever try to take you off such drugs) and ignore the side glances. Don't let someone else judge how you should be feeling when they can have no clue what they're talking about.",

            "answer": "Remember, there is a distinction between addiction and dependence. Many patients have used a medication exactly as proscribed by their Doctor, yet have ended up\u00a0\u00a0having a difficult time quitting or even lowering their dosages. A great example of this is any of the Benzos (Xanax...Valium). They come on these boards, terrified because they think they are weak and stupid addicts (I don't believe addicts as a rule are either of these things btw) their bodies have simply become accustomed to or DEPENDENT on the Benzodiazepine. You can use once a year and still be an addict. Addiction is a disease usually ending in \"jails, institutions or death\". There is a big difference between the two...a big difference.",

    "question": "BACKGROUND: I have Lupus, diagnosed in 1993. I have never had a flair sever enough to need narcotic pain relief.... until my mom passed away from renal failure caused by her Lupus. I hurt literally from head to toe. My hands were so swollen I could barely use the restroom alone. I couldn't walk without wanting to cry, slept downstairs a lot cause it hurt so bad to go up the stairs. I was put on prednisone and vicodin, neither of which worked. My Dr. didn't like how much tylenol I was getting so she put me on oxycodone and finally found the dosage that she was comfortable with, 20mg every 6 hours,but barely helped, then sent me to a rheumatologist who put me on prednisone (2nd treatment) again. After 3rd treatment of prednisone I requested a new rheumatologist that specialized in Lupus. He increased my oxy to 30, yay I can move, and put me on methylpred which finally started reducing the inflammation. I was on the methylpred for about 8 months, I took myself off, my progress had stopped. I still have extreme pain and the oxy is all that allows me to function. FINALLY MY QUESTION:\u00a0\u00a0How is needing pain medication to truly function any different than someone needing Heart, Blood Pressure, or Diabetes medications. Why is there a supposed time limit for pain meds but not for again Heart, BP or Diabetes?? I need it and may always but society makes me feel like a druggy..... Any words of wisdom???Thank you",
