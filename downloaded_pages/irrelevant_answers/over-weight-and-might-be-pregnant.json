            "answer": "I am over weight and I had a successful and normal pregnancy with my first child. I actually lost weigt during my pregnancy. Yes they say you should lose weight but truthfully from experience its not about your weight its about your cycle. I did have an ectopic in July but that was because I was a smoker up until I found out I was prego. Good luck to you both.",

            "answer": "i am overweight and 33 wks pregnant. there are certain things that overweight people are more at risk for during pregnancy, but most will go on to have healthy babies. the things you may want to research or look into are....pregnancy induced hypertension and gestational diabetes.being overweight should not scare a person into not getting pregnant but it would help to know what things to look out for and your doctor will likely follow your care closely to make sure you have a happy and safe pregnancy.",

            "answer": "weight can be a big obstacle in conceiving and cause more risks during pregnanc...im just speaking from my own experience..... hormones have been knocked out of whack because im very overweight.i wasnt ovulating and was told i would need fertility meds to get pregnant.well when i went to docs to see why i was sick back in sept,found out i was pregnant.so the ovulation issue worked itself out i guess.i originally wanted to try and get my weight in order before i tried getting pregnant,but this lil guy had a plan of his own lol....also,my sugar levels came back high from my 1 hr testing,and now have to do the 3 hr fasting test.once again,my weight is probably the culprit ..not saying weight is an issue for everyone,but sometimes can cause probs conceiving or during pregnancy..problem free conception and/or pregnancy isnt a guarantee for anyone really,but the weight issue shouldnt really scare you.every woman and pregnancy is different.so just because weight is an issue for one person,doesnt mean it will be for everyone.just discuss your concerns with your doc",
