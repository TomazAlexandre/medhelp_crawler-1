            "answer": "The best way to reverse your condition would be to get your diabetes under excellent control with diet and meds.Low carb diet usually helps along with optimising meds (insulin etc)..Neuropathy can be reversible if blood sugars can be managed close to normal levels.the Book Diabetes Solutions (you can easily google this) is the best I have found for how to address this.\u00a0\u00a0It is not easy solution but it can work.",

    "question": "I have diabetes, peripheral neuropathy, chronic bronchitis, COPD, hiatal hernia, GERD, restless leg syndrome, arthritic cervical spondylosis, alergies,\u00a0\u00a0ADD (my primary care dr says), but have never been diagnosed with it. It makes sense, however, as when in school and even now, I will be talking about one subject and will constantly go off on another completely different subject. My attention span is very short and always has been. My main problem now is the pain, numbness, dropping things all of the time because of pain/numbness in hands, have trouble being on my feet due to the neuropathy. Was on insulin, Novolo 70/30 and it worked pretty well, however, caused my ankles and feet to swell to a point where walking is very painful. I'm looking for something other than Vicodin, Percocet and Neurontin (3600 mg/day) to use for pain. The Vicodin works a little bit, as does the Percocet. The Neurontin also works a little bit and again, am looking for one pain RX that would work for all instead of taking more than one. Have a friend on the Fentanyl patch and she swears by it. Says it is much better at pain relief than the Percocet or Vicodin and she's not on Neurontin. Please\u00a0\u00a0help. I have an appt with my pain mgmt dr on Thurs, 2/16/12 and want to have something I can discuss with him to see if he will try me on the Fentanyl patch or some other patch (if there are any others that I am unaware of). Thanks. Linda Sevilla",
