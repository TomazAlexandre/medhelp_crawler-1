Soon they'll have u checking your blood sugar levels and you'll learn what makes your sugar levels high and what does.\u00a0\u00a0They told me i could eat two fruits a day so thats not so bad because i love fruits as well. Lol",

    "question": "I did the glucose test and they informed me that I failed and immediately signed me up for a nutritional class thing at the local hospital.\u00a0\u00a0The thing is I'm only 4 weeks 6 days! I have heard most women don't get it until their 2nd trimester.\u00a0\u00a0What can I expect and what will my diet look like? I'm disappointed that I won't be able to eat a lot of fruit which I love. And drink options seem incredibly minimal.\u00a0\u00a0I will do it for my baby of course but idk alot about it so any info is appreciated :)",
