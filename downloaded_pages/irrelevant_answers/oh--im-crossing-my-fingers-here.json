            "answer": "Tingling or numbness in extremities aren't symptoms people usually experience when their blood sugar is high, but can be the results of longterm high blood sugars (called neuropathy).Symptoms of high blood sugar are more like increased thirst, urination and fatigue. Your symptoms are not shouting diabetes to me, but I'm sure the doctor will check for that as well as other possibilities. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Mmm, neuropathy, sounds delightful. All joking aside, it sounds plausible given the reading I've done. The pains/tingling in my feet didn't make falling back to sleep at 1:30am any easier.I must admit to an abundant sleepiness today. Frequent urination has happened in the past, just not in the past few days. Thirst hasn't been a problem. Perhaps diabetes may have eluded me, though the other options are none too thrilling.We'll see, we'll see. Thanks for the response.",

            "answer": "It sounds like diabetic neuropathy.Although the presentation is not typical, onset of numbness after a quart of a simple sugar such as orange juice is consistant with early diabetic neuropathy.Plus the sleepiness.You need an hba1c and a diabetic evaluation.",

            "answer": "Your symptoms sound more like high blood pressure to me. Often diabetes and high blood pressure go hand in hand. I am glad you are getting checked out. If it is something it is better to know as soon as possible so you can start getting treated and taking care of your body. Its the only one we have! :)",

            "answer": "Well, had my check-in today, and I left it feeling a bit better. That is, less concerned; The pain/tingling of my extremities is still an on/off feature for the day.My blood pressure, pulse (both in wrist and feet) and blood pressure received the comment of \"perfect\" from the nurse and doctor - I remember blood glucose being 105, little over 4 hours after eating with some exercise in between. In fact, they seemed a bit impressed, given my BMI and how I keep my body guessing going from vegan to balanced to total junk.That said I'm definitely still getting the bloodwork done. Going in on Monday morning. I'm paying out of pocket (seasonal job, no insurance), so they're starting me with the basic tests; A1C (just in case), B12 and Thyroid. If the condition in my hands and feet continue by the time I get my results back, I'm to check right back in with them for more attention. Granted the blood tests themselves don't wave a red flag around, that is, 'cause I'd be seeing more of them anyway.In the meantime I'll just regulate my diet a little better, stay away from extreme intakes of anything, and maybe pick up a multivitamin for men just for the heck of it.",

            "answer": "Unfortunately a blood glucose 4 hours after eating isn't too meaningful. Your blood sugar could have spiked from food and return to normal by then. I personally don't even see a point to random blood sugars unless they are glaringly high. Good thing you're getting the A1C and thyroid. Let us know how it goes.On the diet extremes thing, I call it the \"twinkie granola syndrome\", eating super ultra healthy then feeling deprived and eating a bunch of junk. Most of us (with and without diabetes) find a nice moderate but healthy middle ground is something we can live with more on an ongoing basis.",

    "question": "To be honest, I may not have any business posting in a diabetes forum, for I have yet to find out if I have it for sure. I have an appointment with my physician this coming Friday (08/06) and should be getting the blood work results back next Monday. But hang with me, because my current condition worries me a tad...Y'see, I'm not a great eater all the time, and my BMI ain't desireable, which I can tell without looking at a chart. Sometimes I have a great diet with my mother's influence in organic vegan foods, but other times I'm prone to binge something awful on fast foods and frozen junk, particularly because I live in the middle of nowhere and the very sight of either inspires awe and nostalgia.So the past couple days I've had just such an episode with the wretched delights from a frozen food aisle. Though what may have been the kicker was a veritable \"vanishing act\" of a whole jug of Simply Orange brand orange juice. I mean \"whoosh,\" downed in two hours. Shortly thereafter, I noticed a cringing, mild pain on the pads of my feet. Not necessarily painful, really, but very much alike the feeling of poor circulation, just in isolated areas. It tapers off, I work slowly on some other items associated with carbs, and it cranks back on.Enter today's mess. Intermittently, my feet, toes, hands and fingers may experience short bouts of this cringing, numb-like sensation. Also for awhile I was a little hazy in the head, but I'd rather chalk that up to sleep depravation and/or sinus congestion. Plus there are the consistent headaches, but mild and with a cool forehead, likely a sinus headache.Overall the immediate impression I make on people is hyperglycemia, sprinkled with sinus problems. I had in fact recently suppressed a sinus infection, though I suppose it's possible another is lingering and may not help with blood glucose. Meanwhile I've eaten very little; Merely a Nutrigrain fruit bar and a couple fried eggs. Plenty of water, some coffee (caffeinated) to get me through the work day. I managed to get out for some excercise 1.5 hours ago, a bit of hiking, which has made a slight improvement for my limbs' tingling starting just a few minutes ago.Additional details: I've taken antihistamines nightly for the past 4 days. No blurred vision, chest pains, excessive sleepiness (beyond what lack of sleep would entail) or passive/aggressive behavior. I daresay I've been something of a sweetheart to the campers today. In any case what I described didn't tickle the nurse I spoke to over the phone as an emergency, so I opted to make a reasonably-timed appointment.So, for those of you who've gotten through this book: congradulations. Also, any tips or musings on my situation would be most encouraging.",
