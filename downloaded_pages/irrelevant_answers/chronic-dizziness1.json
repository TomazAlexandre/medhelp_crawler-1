            "answer": "My husband has been having constant dizziness following a chiropractic adjustment 6 weeks ago. He also describes it as a drunk feeling, very lightheaded as if his head could float off his body. He's had MRI, CT scans of arteries and an ENG test. None of his doctors can figure out what is wrong. They say it will resolve, but how do they know if they don't know what has caused it. He also has a herniated disc at C6-C7 so not sure if that is causing it. We are starting to get worried.",

    "question": "I am a 29,year old white female. For the past 11 months I have had constant dizziness and light headedness accompanied with occasional headaches and blurred vision. Often a feeling of being \"drunk\". I have had and MRI to rule out MS and a tumor. I had blood work work up, EKG, 24 hr holter monitor, 24eeg. All normal. I have been seen by my PCP, a opthalmologist, and ENT and two neurologists. My PCP thinks it is anxiety, as I did have one anxiety attack this past year. Never experienced that before. I do have htn, but have had it since I was 12 and have alwayas been medicated for it. I have hypothyroidism but my levels are normal range. Neurologist suggested autonomic testing to be done. I have been doing some research on excess candidia in the body that has symptoms I can attest to. I have no idea what is going on and I would love your input.",
