            "answer": "Normal ALT is 6-40. Have you had a history of drinking since your AST is lower then your ALT?\u00a0\u00a0Depakote is hepatotoxic and I would stay off the acetametaphin which can also cause elevated liver enzymes. Being diabetic and obese can also raise these enzymes. I agree with J could be fatty liver. But get checked out and keep up the exercising and diet control. Losing weight can help with lowering the liver enzymes if you have fatty liver. Keep us posted and I will do the same. I am certainly not a medical expert so be sure to go to a gastro specialist.",

    "question": "I have a continuing elevated ALT ranging between 65-75 over the last 9 months.\u00a0\u00a0AST is staying around 40.\u00a0\u00a0I have had blood work drawn four times to monitor my thyroid, pre-diabetes and cholestrol.\u00a0\u00a0Because the ALT has remained elevated I have been sent for additional tests and an ultrasound of the liver.\u00a0\u00a0(I had my gallbladder removed 10 months ago.)\u00a0\u00a0The ultrasound and hepatitis panel has come back ok.\u00a0\u00a0I am still waiting for additional results.\u00a0\u00a0I am 46, 185 lbs, I walk 30 minutes most days, but do not work out.\u00a0\u00a0Daily meds are Synthroid, Niaspan, Fortamet and Calcium.I suffer from migraines and was on Depakote and Aleve daily for two years probably 10 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I changed jobs and the migraines are less and I no longer take a daily preventative.\u00a0\u00a0I now only have occasional headaches and take Aleve or Excedrin or Percocet - all of which contain acetametaphin.\u00a0\u00a0I have read that it can cause liver disease.Since 75 ALT is not extremely elevated and the Hep panel and liver ultrasound are clear, do I need to be concerned?\u00a0\u00a0If so, what do I need to do to get my ALT back into normal range?",
