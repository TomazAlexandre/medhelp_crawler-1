            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I would suggest you consult another neurosurgeon. A CT scan should be done to assess if there is deep seated infection. Yes, bone implants are often used in neurosurgery to cover holes in the skull. However, they are usually successful in small holes. The other possibility is to remove this bone and put it back after the infection is controlled. The third possibility is a bone graft. Without actually examining the problem, it is difficult to comment on net. Please discuss these options with your doctor. If the gap left by bone removal will not be much and the mesh will be placed, then also the skull will retain its contour. Cosmetic correction can be tried. Again as I said earlier, it is difficult to comment for sure on net.Also check and see whether you have diabetes. This could also cause recurrent infections.Hope this helps. Take care!",
