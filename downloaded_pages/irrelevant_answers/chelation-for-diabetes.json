            "answer": "I read that diabetes 2 is not always caused by an unhealthy lifestyle or by being overweight. That it could be caused by exposure to toxins (pesticides, plastic) that could cause damage in genes. And this is why there are people who are thin an still have diabetes 2.I also read that chelation is used to release toxins from the body. So I was wondering if it could be of any help for insulin resistance or diabetes 2?",

            "answer": "I doubt it.\u00a0\u00a0For one thing, you'd have to know what exactly caused it to know what had to be leached out of the system.\u00a0\u00a0For another, chelation is mostly used for cholesterol or heavy metals, not just anything -- you have to have something that attaches to and leaches out the culprit.\u00a0\u00a0Many toxins are leached out in another way, by cleansing the liver, where the toxins are stored, and by cleansing the colon and the blood, for the same reason.\u00a0\u00a0This isn't chelation, but cleansing.\u00a0\u00a0I say all this not knowing a thing about diabetes being caused by toxins, so this isn't specific to your problem.\u00a0\u00a0My own knowledge of Type II diabetes is it's basically a disease of poor eating habits compiled over a lifetime, and you don't have to be overweight to have eaten too many foods that overtaxed your pancreas, though it is most common to be so.\u00a0\u00a0People who exercise a lot, for example, avoid being overweight, but can still suffer from from what they eat.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone's body and its various functions has its breaking point.",

            "answer": "Two environmental toxins, arsenic and dioxin (dibenzo-p-dioxins), may have some relationship to an increased risk for diabetes. It should be noted that results only indicate a possible relationship between diabetes and environmental toxins. The authors strongly suggest that further studies be conducted to determine the true nature and extent of the relationships reported in the literature.",

            "answer": "Yes, I would have to know exactly what caused it, for it to be leached out of the system. However I have a doubt. Does any chelation process targets a specific heavy metal, or they target many at the same time? so the body releases the one it contains? For example I\u00b4ve read that coriander, chlorella may work on different toxins.Is there a test I can do to determine exactly what kind of heavy metal is in my system?....or it is discovered by doing chelation and then analysing urine afterwards?",

            "answer": "I don't know any link between heavy metals and diabetes, so let's start there.\u00a0\u00a0EDTA is a sort of all-purpose chelation agent that's used for cholesterol and other things.\u00a0\u00a0To chelate out a specific substance, you find another substance that tends to be in balance with that metal or has an affinity for it.\u00a0\u00a0For example, if you were too high in calcium deposits, magnesium is the chelation agent for calcium, and so on.\u00a0\u00a0As to testing for heavy metals, some show up in blood tests, some don't, and there's controversy, naturally, over how much is too much, since we're all repositories of a multitude of toxins.\u00a0\u00a0Mercury is omnipresent, as well as lead, and of course petrochemicals contain all kinds of toxins.\u00a0\u00a0Tobacco has all kinds of toxins.\u00a0\u00a0There are pesticides, formaldehyde, arsenic in the water, mercury is from coal and dental fillings, lead from paint and insulation, asbestos from insulation, fungicides, herbicides, air pollutants -- it just goes on and on almost to infinity.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is attaching causation to any one thing for any one person, given the prevailing sentiment in the industrialized world, and above all the US, is to argue for as much allowed pollution as possible so people who already have money can make more of it.\u00a0\u00a0So, yeah, you of course have heavy metals in your system, and many can be tested for, but does it prove anything you can work with regarding diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Who knows?\u00a0\u00a0As for chlorella, this isn't so much a chelating agent as a cleansing agent, as is true with all algae.\u00a0\u00a0Algae tends to soak up toxins in the oceans and in fresh water, and in our bodies, so these are often used to help cleanse the body of toxins.\u00a0\u00a0There are also cleansers specific to the liver, the kidneys, etc., in natural medicine.\u00a0\u00a0I would say if you want to take this further, you'd probably have to see a holistic nutritionist, a doctor who has been trained in integrated medicine, or a naturopath to see how far it goes.\u00a0\u00a0As for urine, yes, but long-lived toxins will find a home in the liver and other fatty tissues or blood or the intestinal tract.\u00a0\u00a0In your case, I'm assuming you think the pancreas is another place to look.\u00a0\u00a0All organs can be repositories of stored toxins, as the body tries to put them someplace out of the way.\u00a0\u00a0That's the liver's job, but all organs do it to a certain extent.\u00a0\u00a0If it's flushed out in the urine, it probably isn't in the body long enough to cause the kind of harm you're looking for, and it would more be an influence of the kidneys than the pancreas, but you're above my job description now.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck, but since dietary and exercise changes have been very successful with keeping Type II in check, I'd still start there.",
