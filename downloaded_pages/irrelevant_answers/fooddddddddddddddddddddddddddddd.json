            "answer": "My husband is a truck driver.\u00a0\u00a0When he was first DX with diabetes he would take snacks with him so that he wouldn't go over 5 hours without eating as instructed by the dietician. The problem with this was that he snacked all day. The way I understood it was that sugar wasn't the problem it is a lot with the carbs.\u00a0\u00a0So I would try to stay away from breads and pototoes.\u00a0\u00a0There are a lot of fast food places that offer wraps instead of buns.Also do you have a refrig in your truck?\u00a0\u00a0My husband has one and it actually holds a bit.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't get home to often you can always stop at a wal mart as they don't mind trucks stopping in their parking lot plus most are easy to get in and out of and you could do a bit of grocery shopping.\u00a0\u00a0My husband would keep none parishables and fresh fruits in his truck.\u00a0\u00a0The truck stops will let you bring in your own food and use the microwaves.\u00a0\u00a0I would use a unmistakeable container or if it is a package (like a brutio) just let the attendant know as you walk in but just have your own container to avoid any problems.When my husband was out all week I would make food mostly meat for about a week plus about 10 gallons of tea.\u00a0\u00a0I would freeze the tea and he had a cooler to place it in the was able to place the meat around the frozen tea.\u00a0\u00a0He would eat that before eating fast food to bet the melting.A reading of 500 is high.\u00a0\u00a0I not sure of the complacations of that but I know it isn't good over a long period.\u00a0\u00a0My husband didn't take care of his diebetes and now has neuropathy but the Dr said it can be reversed if he started to control his blood levels.\u00a0\u00a0Are you on meds?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you could stop a med check somewhere.",
