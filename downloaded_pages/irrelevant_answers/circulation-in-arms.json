            "answer": "Glad to hear that you have your diabetes in control with diet. For type II diabetes it is all about diet. A whole plant based diet with no added sugar or fat Is the best you can do. Read the Dr. Mc Dougall's Starch Solution.\u00a0\u00a0As for the unfortunate problem with your arms it sounds like a nerve problem and possibly nerve damage. It could be inflammation or temporary like Carpal tunnel can be. But, I would report it as a work injury and not do it again. See if they can send you to a workmans comp doctor. If they won't do that the see your own doctor or neurologist about it. I hope it is temporary. Again, no matter what I wouldn't go back to any of that type of work again even if you get better. Take it from someone who got injured on the job.",

    "question": "I am 33 years old, i have type 2 diabetes, i have always had issues with circulation in my legs and feet, then i started eating allot better and stooping almost all sugar intake and it made it an almost none issue as long as i stay away from all sugar and lose weight, i have another issue that has hit me suddenly and its almost to the point where i cant work or even type on the computer at all. i was on a job site digging trenches and i don't normally do this but i am am at a temp agency and so i was digging and using a electric shovel the shakes etc to break up the ground, after about 8 hours of this and into the night my arms became so sore that i could not really move them and even close my hands or move my arms at all. i thought this would go away and made excuse why i could not go to the temp agency the next day so my muscles could recover. but my arms did somewhat feel better but what i have now following it is almost debilitating to say the least. no matter how i position my arms etc they usually will go like fully numb within a few sec's, and to the point where i can not control my hands in typing within like 15 seconds or so. i am a person that can type about 40 words a minute when i was in college class's now i cant even finish a sentence without 30 errors and twitching etc. what could this be ? why do my arms constantly feel numb??? does not seem to matter how i hold my arms etc, i could be moving box's on another site and it still seems to go numb like none stop.",
