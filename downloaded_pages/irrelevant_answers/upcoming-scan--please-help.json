            "answer": "I had to have the test recently.\u00a0\u00a0On hepc treatment the interferon screwed up my thyroid.It is nothing at all and should not interfer with anything or hurt your liver. It IS an extremely IMPORTANT test because you need it to find out how much Synthroid you should be taking or not (if needed).I was diagnosed extremely hyper. I scheduled the scan and had it two weeks later. during that small time window my thyroid completely flip flopped and I went extremely hypo.Had I not had the test I never would have known.Thyroid issues need to be dealt with - it is your entire metabolism at stake.Please - take the pills and have the test.(PS I am a stage 3 and they had no problems with me having it whatsoever).",

            "answer": "Thanks nygirl- I have had hep c for probably 25 years. Yes, I had a bx 5 years ago and have mild inflammation, mild fibrosis and fatty liver. I do not want treatment at this time.My thyroid problems are not caused by the hep c- discovered a thyroid nodule 30 years ago, before I contracted the hep c and the nodule was causing hyperthyroid symptoms. Took radioactive iodine 10 years ago to rectify the hyper,and it resolved and stabilized and became normal.However, blood tests I had recently, show me going back into hyper, and now the doc wants to do a thyroid scan and the only way they can scan it is if I take the isotope.No, the doc is not a liver specialist. I have CHP and have to be referred and that could take some time. I just hope he knows what he is doing- he is aware that I do have hep c.",

    "question": "I have hep c. I am scheduled for a thyroid scan next week and have to swallow a radionuclide pill (it is a radioactive iodine pill) in order for them see how my thyroid is functioning.Is it safe for the liver? Now I wonder if I should cancel the test. I was reading a little about it, and it says it might damage cells in the ovaries and testis, and is eliminated in the lungs, kidneys and liver. My doc knows I have hep c and never mentioned any harm from the iodine pill.I am concerned about damage to the liver- had a hysterectomy, so not worried about ovaries. States its safe, but thought I would get some input first.Please help, need an answer before I proceed with this test.",
