            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body, but are often felt in your hands, feet, arms, or legs. Many causes of numbness are there. These include injury to the back or spinal cord, Lack of blood supply to the legs as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels(peripheral artery disease), diabetes, stroke,motor neurone disease,lupus erythematosis, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid or parathyroid glands. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause tingling in the knee and legs.Thyroid disease,diabetes and vit B12 deficiency have been ruled out.MRI will help in differentiating the other causes.Menopause can be a possibility for causing such symptoms.It depends on how old are you?peripheral artery disease can be another possibility and you need to get X-ray angiography and magnetic resonance imaging angiography (MRA) done to diagnose it.Lymes disease has a characteristic red rash on the body after tick bite.However,you can confirm lyme\u2019s disease by blood tests like ELISA.Pls discuss the above possibilities with your doctor and do keep us posted on how you are doing.",
