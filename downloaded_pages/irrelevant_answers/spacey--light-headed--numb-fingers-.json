            "answer": "Hello,Cervical; spondolysis is a strong possibility for your symptoms.It can cause both dizziness and numbness in the upper limbs.Other possibilities are vertebrobasilar artery obstruction,carotid sinus syndrome or thoracic outlet syndrome.An x-ray neck or CT/MRI neck can help in diagnosis.However other possibilities of dizziness/light headedness like hypotension,hypoglycemia,TIA,impending stroke,inner ear diseases,acoustic neuroma and endocrine disorders have to be ruled out.For this tingling and numbness,diabetes,hypothyroidism,hypoparathyroidism,lack of vit B12 and minerals like sodium,calcium,potassium , TIA,stroke,carpal tunnel syndrome and charcot marie tooth disease have to be ruled out.A simulataneous approach for diagnosis and treatment has to be followed by a neurologist and orthopedician.Pls consult them soon.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "Hi. Im a 34 yr old female. I have been experiencing some weird symptoms. I feel spaced out, not out in left field, but just kind of weird behind the eyes feeling, like dizzy but not to where Im going to pass out. Ive also been having some tingling and numbness in my pinky fingers on\u00a0\u00a0both hands. I have had a cervical and lumbar strain in the past due to the kind of work I do but nothing that didnt get better with time. I have been overweight for about a 1.5 years now (thanks to my last son!) but otherwise very healthy. Bp is good as well as my blood sugar. Its very annoying because its been constant the past 3-4 days. Any suggestions..........?",
