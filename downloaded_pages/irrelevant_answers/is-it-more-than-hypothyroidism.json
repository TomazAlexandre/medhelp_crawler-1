            "answer": "thyroid panel would check free t4, free t3 (the most important hormone), tsh, thyroid antibodies (antithyroglobulin, antiTPO).\u00a0\u00a0these labs would give a better picture of what is going on overall.\u00a0\u00a0if you have high antibodies, that means that your body is attacking your thyroid, which is causing your hypothyroidism.your free t4 is definitely on the low end.\u00a0\u00a0i suspect that your free t3 is either on the low end or LOW.\u00a0\u00a0being that your tsh is high, i would demand a full thyroid panel and thyroid ultrasound.are you on thyroid replacement (synthroid, levoxyl)?\u00a0\u00a0are you following up with a doctor?\u00a0\u00a0endocrinologist?\u00a0\u00a0i would definitely find an endocrinologist to treat you, especially with your current symptoms and family history.",

            "answer": "Gosh this all makes sense! You have just made me realise that I have a lot of questions to ask. I don't know what level my T3 is at, and I do know how important it is, but you know I have been that ill I have not been thinking properly, so thank you again I will ask. I have never had an ultrasound, or seen an endrocrinologist, but since my (Levothyroxine) has been increased lately I may well have the energy to ask the right questions now... before my levels fall again, because it keeps doing this it makes me think there is something else missing, perhaps cortisol or DHEA. If I have high anti-bodies then that would answer that one, am I right?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor says he will check me again in 4 weeks, it scares me that where I live is so far away from 'proper' specialists. It's why I joined this site. Your response has made my mind up to insist on an endocrinologist. You know my son who has Addisons has never seen one, it was the diabetic clinic he was sent to.",

    "question": "I am 58years old and have hypothyroidism, and my latest results came back;FreeT4\u00a0\u00a013.1 pmol/l\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0TSH 16.40 mIU/lI am concerned I have adrenal insufficiency,as I have complete exhaustion, find it hard to wake up, let alone get through the day.\u00a0\u00a0 All my white blood cells are low and I have neutropenia. My muscles are so painful, and sore to touch. They fasiculate, my CKmm is 414. I also get numbness and tingling.\u00a0\u00a0 Terrible back pain just above the waistline.\u00a0\u00a0Cholesterol at 9. Alk Phos 144.\u00a0\u00a0Suffer horrendous vertigo with sickness, terrible funny headaches and eyesight goes blurry. I could go on but I am so fed up of it all.\u00a0\u00a0Feel I have suffered for over 10 years, after a perriod of extreme prolonged stress. Once I was rushed into hospital unconscious for 7 hours, was found cold, with blue lips, was given equivalent of 30 teasp. sugar and heaps of salt. When I got to hospital I was still unconscious, and hypoglycaemic, they gave me Saline,\u00a0\u00a0next day they tested for Addisons. Negative result. Now am I right in thinking that after all that salt and sugar a test so soon after treatment would be useless?\u00a0\u00a0I have been tested for diabetes also negative. I was started on thyroxine about 3 years ago and the dose keeps on going up, now at 150mg a day, the dosage stays fine for a few months then I just seem to need more. ...Please give me some advice!\u00a0\u00a0By the way my son has Addisons and Type1 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Also my mother had all these symptoms when she died. My older sister also suffers from most of them.",
