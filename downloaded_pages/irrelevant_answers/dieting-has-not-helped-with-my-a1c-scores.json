            "answer": "Hi and thanks for using the forum.A hemoglobin A1c score between 6 and 6.5 is considered pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0What this score means is that you have an increased risk of developing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0YOu are doing all the right things by watching your diet, losing weight, exercising, etc.\u00a0\u00a0This is pretty much what you would need to do.\u00a0\u00a0YOu need to decrease your risk factor of developing diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It may be that your numbers never get any higher, and you may remain in that pre-diabetes category.\u00a0\u00a0Your numbers could also improve because of the lifestyle changes that you have made. Or you could go on to develop diabetes.Continue to follow up with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He or she will let you know how often they want you to come in to have your blood work checked.\u00a0\u00a0They also can counsel you on any other lifestyle changes that you can make.\u00a0\u00a0I think it is unecessary to check your blood glucose on a daily basis at this point in time, however you can discuss this with your doctor and see how he/she feels about it.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and keep up the good work.Bridget",
