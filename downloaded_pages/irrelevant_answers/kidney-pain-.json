            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The common causes for the back pain could be infections/inflammations of the bowel, kidney disorders like pyeloneohritis, glomerulonephritis or renal colic. Others are pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, endometritis and polycystic ovarian syndrome. I would advise you to\u00a0\u00a0consult your primary care physician for evaluation of pain. He will ask for blood tests, urine analysis, an x ray and an ultra sonogram of the abdomen. Sometimes he may ask for an Intravenous pyelogram and a CT scan.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime take OTC Naproxen for pain relief and plenty of oral fluids.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
