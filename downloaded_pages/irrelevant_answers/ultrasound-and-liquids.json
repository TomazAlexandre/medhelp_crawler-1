            "answer": "Any liquid works as it all fills your bladder. They just say water as its better for you and sometimes the sugar in other drinks turn baby into a break dancer and can be hard to get measurements hahapower aid and like wise aren't really energy drink so be careful calling them that as people tend to think you're drinking red bull or like wise which is bad. I've had people be confused about that and been given unnecessary lectures haha I swear by red power aid for my morning sickness. It worked wonders when Ifeel sick or gross. So yeah its safe just because of the amount of sugar in your diet for concerns of gestational diabetes",

            "answer": "Okay thanks girls, and I know I though about calling it an energy drink after I wrote it. And yeah power aid is what gets me by at the moment I don't know why but before I was pregnant all I drank is water and I really can't handle it anymore. Yeah I know I was thinking if I drank only power aid by baby will be going crazy thats why I am struggling this water down. :-)",

But my whole pregnancy so far I have had trouble keeping water down do you think if I drink 600mL of water and the rest a poweraid that will be okay? Or just water? It's my 12 week scan! By the way my doctor said I am aloud to drink energy drinks such as poweraid and gateraid through my pregnancy.",
