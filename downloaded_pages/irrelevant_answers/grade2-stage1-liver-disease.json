            "answer": "Get your dr to check your iron levels...iron overload, known as hemochromatosis causes liver damage, cirrohsis. It is the most common genetic disorder found among people of European descent and most rarely diagnosed. Left undetected and untreated it leads to cirrhosis.People can get cirrhosis even if they do not drink, and drs are missing these vital clues. You need to get him/her to run iron tests not found on routine blood work...ferritin, transferrin saturation%, TIBC and serum iron...family history is important information, if there is diabetes, heart failure, or other cancers, and liver disease.This is one thing to rule out, it was missed in my husband and he has stage 2 peri-portal fibrosis with inflammation and lesions. Someone can be pain and symptom free and yet the liver is silently getting damaged and injured.Get copies of your blood tests and you can know what they have checked you for and your levels, it is good to monitor your progress. If it is something to do with iron, the good news is that it is treated easily, and the progression of liver disease can be stopped or slowed considerably once the iron levels reach normal.Your liver enzymes tests are good to get done, I'm sure they have, so you need to know what they are (ALT, AST, and GGT)Just passing on some info for another lead to investigate, as the cause of your liver problem remains undiagnosed as you say.",

            "answer": "\"lose weight and exercise\" Is the treatment for people with Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD).American Liver Foundationhttp://www.liverfoundation.org/abouttheliver/info/nafld/Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease\"WHAT IS NAFLD?Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the build up of extra fat in liver cells that is not caused by alcohol. It is normal for the liver to contain some fat. However, if more than 5% - 10% percent of the liver\u2019s weight is fat, then it is called a fatty liver (steatosis).WHO IS LIKELY TO HAVE NAFLD?NAFLD tends to develop in people who are overweight or obese or have diabetes, high cholesterol or high triglycerides. Rapid weight loss and poor eating habits also may lead to NAFLD.However, some people develop NAFLD even if they do not have any risk factors. NAFLD affects up to 25% of people in the United States.RISKSNAFLD may cause the liver to swell (steatohepatitis). A swollen liver may cause scarring (cirrhosis) over time and may even lead to liver cancer or liver failure.SYMPTOMSNAFLD often has no symptoms.When symptoms occur, they may include fatigue, weakness, weight loss, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, spider-like blood vessels, yellowing of the skin and eyes (jaundice), itching, fluid build up and swelling of the legs (edema) and abdomen (ascites), and mental confusion.DIAGNOSISNAFLD is initially suspected if blood tests show high levels of liver enzymes. However, other liver diseases are first ruled out through additional tests. Often, an ultrasound is used to confirm the NAFLD diagnosis.",
