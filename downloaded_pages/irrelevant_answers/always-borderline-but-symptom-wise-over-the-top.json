            "answer": "A TSH of a little over 6.0 is high enough to give you symptoms, and high enough that you should be on replacement meds.Have you ever had antibody tests run?If your thyroid bloodwork is so upside down that the doc accused you of medicating behind his back, he should have sent you to an Endocrinologist. A thyroid specialist, not a Diabetes specialist.",

            "answer": "Was sent to an Endo.\u00a0\u00a0The Endo, did the antibody test - said Hashimottos, Diabetes, PCOD and then returned me to my PCP (which I have changed because of all of this), who put me on meds for all of them....\u00a0\u00a0then his trusted PA, took me off of the synthroid when I started complaining that the symptoms where getting worse.I have since been told - nope to Diabetes, nope to PCOD and maybe to hypo.\u00a0\u00a0They have added in MS.My area does not have many endo's and the wait list is almost a year to get in.\u00a0\u00a0I have an awesome PCP now but its a SLOW process and I was hoping to find someone who might know something about crazy blood results and symptomatic worsening.\u00a0\u00a0On synthroid .112 but it might as well be water.\u00a0\u00a0In the last month, with strict diet monitoring, I have gained almost 30 pounds!",

            "answer": "If the symptoms increase after starting Synthroid, adrenal insufficiency needs to be ruled out.My endo just did an ACTH/aldosterone Stimulation test on me to rule it out. He will not raise my dose unless results are good. It could cause an adrenal crisis if the dose is increased in the presence of adrenal insufficiency.I had terrible symptoms at a TSH of 6, after being in the high end of the normal range for many years. Mostly hyper symptoms- insomnia and anxiety.",

    "question": "All my life I have fought \"borderline\" hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Been on medications and taken off (because of different schools of thoughts by docs or P.A's).Had an radio uptake study done some years ago, 2% was taken up (whatever that means.... never did have anyone explain the results to me).Now years later, and a ton more symptoms...... I have found myself with heart rate issues.\u00a0\u00a0Cardialogist says I am a 35 year old woman and I should have my thyroid checked.\u00a0\u00a0Been in the hospital twice the in last month for extreme high pulse and blood pressure (blood pressure is good most the time... rarely does it go up).\u00a0\u00a0Have my thyroid checked..... its a little over 6.\u00a0\u00a0Other Doc blows it off as not being high enough to worry about.So here I am (yet again) with a slu of symptoms...... and no help.Dry hair (falls out), fast pulse (100-130) resting, moody, weight gain without reason insane the last month, so tired I could sleep all day but not able to sleep hardly at all even at night, feel swollen all over, face looks like its puffy.... blah blah blahThe last time I had blood work done, the Doc got in my face and accused me of taking thyroid stimulating meds from other docs because the blood results where so crazy.\u00a0\u00a0He said it showed both hypo and hyper results... how is that possible?\u00a0\u00a0I WAS NOT ON ANY meds.... not even asprin.What can cause all this but still be \"borderline\" normal???",
