            "answer": "The term diabetes melitis comes from the Greek word for fountain. I'm not sure diabetes is the best term in the world. There are varieties of insulin-utilization syndromes. The only way to know for sure is to have either a fasting glucose test or what is called an insulin clamp test. You could probably do the fasting glucose test youself by researching the protol in the internet, now that inexpensive accurate blood sugar meters are available. There are a couple of other possibilities suggested by the medication prescribed. Look the medicine up in the PDR (physician's Desk Reference) and you will get more information. Four days isn't a long time. I would take the medication and your physician's advice.",

    "question": "I have been having very annoying bouts of frequent urination. I go to the bathroom alot during the day, but at night, it's every few minutes. It's so bad I only get about 3-4 hours of sleep every night. And, even after I go, I feel like I still have to go. At first I just had to go to the bathroom alot. I thought it would go away, but now, it CONSTANTLY feels like my bladder is full. Sometimes I try to go to the bathroom and nothing will come out. It's getting so bad that I can't sleep. I finally went to the Urgent Care Center down the street from my house. They took a urine sample and said it WAS NOT a bladder infection/UTI. The doctor did say there was very very faint traces of something (It was a long word, I forgot what it was) She prescribed me Phenazopyridine. I haven't taken any yet. I'm just wondering, if this isn't a bladder infection what could it be? Also, she asked me if my sides/back/stomach hurt or if it hurt/if I had burning when I urinated. There is no pain or burning, just the annoying urge to pee every few seconds. This has been going on for 4 days.Please help!",
