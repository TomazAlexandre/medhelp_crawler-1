            "answer": "Possible they could be related to the perimenopausal state or could be the beginning of a diabetic peripheral neuropathy. An EMG and neuro exam may be helpful for further evaluation. If the symptoms are bothering you, consider neurontin or elavil which has helped some of our patients who have painful neuropathies. Good luck",

    "question": "2 years ago I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's disease (hypothyroidism).\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks ago I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In the past year I have been having these sharp shooting pains, mainly in my arms, fingers, legs, and toes, which happens every so often.\u00a0\u00a0It is not constant, but when they do happen the pains can be anywhere. One second it is in my finger, the next it is in my leg, and it goes on and on. Also it seems that around the same time I get this lightheaded feeling and have a hard time with focusing. Now, I am also 45 years old and perimenopausal. Yuk. I have noticed that these aches and pains always come around the time of my period. Could they be hormone related or due to the diabetes and hypothyroidism?\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I am being slammed from every direction. The most troubling thing right now is the lightheadedness and trouble focusing. My endo thinks my aches and pains may be fibromyalgia from what I have described to him.\u00a0\u00a0I have not seen a neurologist yet but I guess that will be the next thing.\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to hear from someone right away as far as the wierd sensations I am having.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your response.",
