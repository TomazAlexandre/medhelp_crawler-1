    "question": "Ok I know ultrasounds are not completely accurate..I had to have one yesterday and my son was already measuring 5 1/2 pounds at 31 weeks. When my doctor measured from pubic bone to top of uterus I was 5/6 cm bigger than I should be. There has to be ladies out there that have gone through or that are going through the same thing? Please share experiences! Thank you!!",
