            "answer": "Rossi,Thanks for your questions.The 81 yo in question is going to have to take a risk.\u00a0\u00a0Either decision, to take a blood thinner or no, is associated with risk.\u00a0\u00a0What needs to be balanced is the potential harm from the coumadin versus the benefit.The potential to bleed from a gastric ulcer needs to be quantified.\u00a0\u00a0Does he/she currently have an ulcer.\u00a0\u00a0This question is easily addressed by endoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0Alternatively, serial stool cards may let his/her doctor know if he/she is currently bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0How severe was the previous ulcer? Was there bleeding before or just discomfort?\u00a0\u00a0These questions need to be discussed.The stroke risk can be more easily quantified.\u00a0\u00a0If the person has had a previous stroke, then their annual stroke risk is at least 5%.\u00a0\u00a0If they have risk factors for stroke with afib, such as hypertension, diabetes, advanced age, or hear failure, then the stroke risk is between 3-5% per year.Discuss these topics with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Their is no right answer.Magnesium products have no proven benefits in the treatment of afib.\u00a0\u00a0Prescriptions for magnesium for the treatment of afib enrich the manufacturer and the person's urine, but to date no good evidence exists that the magnesium has any benefit for the person with afib.Hope that helps.",

            "answer": "Perhaps Plavix could be used instead of aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0It's a relatively safe platelet aggregate inhibitor.Also their is a surgery now to prevent blood clots in afib patients.\u00a0\u00a0It basically closes off the little corner of the heart where the blood clots form.",

            "answer": "It's actually a catheter procedure to place a blocking device in the left atrial appendage, which is the source of 90 percent of blood clots causing nonrheumatic AF-related strokes.The procedure is called PLAATO which stands for percutaneous left atrial appendage transcatheter occlusion.Unfortunately it doesn't treat Afib, just addressess the clot risk.For more info go to www.heartcenteronline.com, choose \"News Center\" and search on the keyword \"PLAATO\".They also have a lot of articles on AFIB.",

    "question": "Re: your request for more information regarding the 81 yr. old patient, he is being treated for atrial fib. Unfortunately, he is one of those types that cannot tell when he is in afib so we agree he needs some anti-clotting protection. It's just that he would like to explore some alternative to coumadin because of the potential bleeding side effects.Also, have you used any products by Advanced Research? They make a magnesium oratate product that we understand is good for afib sufferers. We know it's just a supplement and not a cure. Is glycinate just as good as oratate (it's hard to get this type of mg product retail.) Any brand names you can recommend for mg products? Again, many, many thanks.",
