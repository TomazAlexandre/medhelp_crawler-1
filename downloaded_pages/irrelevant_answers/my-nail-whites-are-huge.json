            "answer": "Hello,One possibility for your symptoms can be Terry\u2019s nails in which the nails turn white with ground glass appearance. The other possibilities are iron deficiency anemia, hepatic failure, cirrhosis, diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure and hyperthyroidism. If the nail is crumbling then a fungal nail infection caused by onychomycosis needs to be ruled out.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "I have the exact same symptoms: white part of my nails are moving up my nail bed to the pink part and becoming very uneven, worse when I wear nail polish, and particularly bad on my ring finger and pinky of both hands.I have Gilbert's syndrome though which affects the liver and impedes the liver from properly breaking down certain components it normally should break down such as Bilirubin. Get your doctor to check if you Bilirubin levels are abnormally high and to check your liver function.I am not 100% sure that my Gilbert's syndrome is the cause of the appearance of my nails, but I would go to a doctor and check the other possible causes such as diabetes or anemia.",

    "question": "Hi, I just had a question regarding my nails. Over the past several months, the white of my nails has become larger and uneven instead of straight -- and the part that is uneven is where the pink of my nail turns white. All of my fingernails are affected like this, however, it is worst in my ring and pinky fingers. The white part on my right pinky finger goes about halfway down my nail!I did used to bite my nails when I was a child, but I haven't for a long time and so I'm not sure why this is happening so badly now. Is there anything I can do to make them look normal again? It seems to have gotten worse when I wore nail polish, if that means anything.",
