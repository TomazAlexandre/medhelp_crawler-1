            "answer": "Diabetes is not caused by what you eat. It's caused by hormones. Your body cant make and use the insulin it needs for pregnancy. Without enough insulin, glucose can't leave the body and be changed to energy, which causes a high build up of glucose in the blood. Some people become insulin dependent or it can be managed just by dieting. Normally everything goes back to normal after pregnancy.",
