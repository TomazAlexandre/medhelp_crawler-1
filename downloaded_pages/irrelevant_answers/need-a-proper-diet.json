            "answer": "There aren\u2019t necessarily any dietary restrictions for hepatitis patients that I\u2019m aware of. If he\u2019s cirrhotic, his doctor may have given him specific recommendations; if not, he can eat pretty much anything. Proper diet is good for anyone; a good model to follow could be from the American Heart Association, as well as the American Diabetes Association. Emphasis on high fiber, low sugar, and lots of fruits and veggies is always a good idea. Additionally, maintaining ideal body weight and BMI is great too.Good luck\u2014Bill",
