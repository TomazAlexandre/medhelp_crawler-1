            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to parasthesia skin which are quite common in peripheral vascular disorders. They are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the symptoms are gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with Raynard's disease and Lupus.\u00a0\u00a0Last night I was unable to fall asleep because my legs between knee and ankle felt so hot, as if they were on fire.\u00a0\u00a0I tried cooling them with water, but as soon as I got back into bed, it stared again.It was painful and nothing I did seemed to help. I don't know what caused this or if it has anything to do with the Raynards or Lupus.\u00a0\u00a0It lasted about 2 hours and then it went away.\u00a0\u00a0Very strange.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone else have this happen to them?\u00a0\u00a0What might be the cause? and how can I prevent it from happening again?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
