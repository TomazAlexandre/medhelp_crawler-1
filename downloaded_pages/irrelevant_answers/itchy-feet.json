            "answer": "Hello,From the symptoms it looks like a fungal infection or ringworm. Most cases of ringworm respond to over-the-counter products, which contain any of several basic ingredients: miconazole, tolnaftate, terbinafine,ketaconazole and clotrimazole.You can consult a pharmacist and get any cream or lotion containing these ingredients. If the symptoms persist then oral antifungals may be needed. For that you need to consult a dermatologist. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "Hello,Soory replied to an earlier post first. Since the itching is present only while standing and recently you have delivered a baby, so the possibility of vascular causes causing these symptoms is there. The other possibilities are metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidismThey can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a physician. . I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

    "question": "Hi, I delivered a baby 2 months ago. Since 2-3 weeks my feet (only the top and not the soles) start itching if I am standing at one place for more than a couple of minutes. The itching subsides when I start walking or moving around. So long I have been thinking that this was a post-partum thing. Could this be a circulation problem caused by being overweight (Heinght 160cm and weight 75Kgs)?What could this be? Please advise.Regards,EJ",
