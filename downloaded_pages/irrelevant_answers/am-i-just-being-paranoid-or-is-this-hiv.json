    "question": "i was in the dominican republic not last xmas but the xmas before (xmas 2010) and i had sex with a prostitutewe had protected sex but she gave me oral sex without a condom on, i dont recall any cuts or anythingi got really stressed about it but i know its nearly impossible to catch HIV through oral sex, and i never bothered to get it checked.its been nagging at me at the back of my mind, whenever i feel i am coming down with something, and about a year ago, i started to notice my hair to thin... Its actually been shedding quite agressively since last xmas, all over the top of the scalp. My internet research pointed to a possible Telogen Effluvium (TE). It could be male pattern baldness but i doubt it because i would be the first male in my entire family to go bald.Would anyone agree that i am not infected and not going bald, but rather extremely stressed out about the possibility of being infected, which is causing my hair to shed quite suddenly? I am only 25, and i dont have bald spots, just thin areas of hair that i end up hiding under the rest of my hair. Looks to be growing back, but falls easily. Small bulbs at the end of each strand.I am finally getting tested this week, after almost 2 years of wondering.besides, if i had HIV, i would know by now right? dont worry, either way ill get tested.",
