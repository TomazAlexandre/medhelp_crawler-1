    "question": "Hiya people, just wondering out of all you pregnant gals reading what cravings you've had. My mum had cravings for apples with me, and watermelons and bananas with my brother and sister. I am currently craving grapes! Does craving run in families or is our family lacking something in our diet which leads us to crave fruit during pregnancy? Anyone have any ideas? Please post some funny cravings poeple have had, I like hearing other peoples pregnancy experiences! Sarah x",
