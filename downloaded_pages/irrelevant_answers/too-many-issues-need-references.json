            "answer": "I would also believe, as BHP39 stated, that what is called her HDL Cholesterol numbers are very low.\u00a0\u00a0This type of cholesterol keeps the LDL (\"bad\") cholesterol from forming deposits.\u00a0\u00a0I would agree with BHP and surfgirl that some internet research would help, but I'd stay away from any site trying to sell you something.\u00a0\u00a0The American Heart Association has good information.\u00a0\u00a0I am guessing that the docs are going to suggest some exercise for your Mom, and she would be very wise to heed it, as exercise is one way to control diabetes and also to raise the HDL level.\u00a0\u00a0Your mom is probably going to be pretty depressed, that's normal, she's been through the mill as we used to say, but a strong support system to make lifestyle changes is going to be really important and can make all the difference.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes.",

    "question": "I know not all of this is going to be related to heart conditions, but I need some references. My mom just had open heart surgery consisting of 5 bypasses with 6 blockages in her heart. They don't know how she didn't have a heart attack yet. The only reason she went to the hospital was because she just thought she was having muscle spasms. She's recovering from surgery okay, however the doctors are concerned. She was diagnosed with diabetes, high blood pressure and well...\"LOW\" cholesterol which is the issue with them. They said they have never seen cholesterol so low in a patient that had not experienced worst case scenarios...death or at least a major heart attack. Her diabetes are also a major influence.\u00a0\u00a0I need to know where to research the cholesterol issues because they don't even know what exactly to do yet other then give her some meds. Im really scared for her....anyone know where I can get information????",
