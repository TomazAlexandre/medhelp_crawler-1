    "question": "I'm new, confused, and not even sure if I even have diabetes.For the past 2 weeks I've been extremely tired, and hungry, but I blamed that on giving up coffee.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I was eating more to help me stay awake.Then I started peeing like a race horse.\u00a0\u00a0I never wake up to pee at night, but that started 2 nights ago.To top it all off, when I drove my son to school yesterday, I realized I couldn't read the street signs!\u00a0\u00a0I totally panicked.Called my GP for a visit, thinking I had some weird urinary tract infection and eye thing going on at the same time.\u00a0\u00a0My urine came back \"normal\" and she drew blood for a metabolic panel, an A1C, and sent me off to an opthamologist.\u00a0\u00a0It was there that he put the pieces together.\u00a0\u00a0My eyes are \"ok\" in that my vision can be corrected, but my current glasses are suddenly not what my eyes need - by 2x!!\u00a0\u00a0He called it a myopic shift, put it all together with my other symptoms, called my GP and gave me a mini talk on what to do if I experienced any worsening symptoms.I haven't heard back from my GP yet this morning, but I found this forum and thought I'd reach out in case anyone has had something similar happen.Thanks!",
