I'm seeing a specialist Mar 16.\u00a0\u00a0I just wanted to see what people thought, my Doctors seem a little confused.\u00a0\u00a0I had a fasting of 140 then I ate and it went down to 90.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't get it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm here to see if anyone else has ever had this happen to them.\u00a0\u00a0It seems it doesn't matter what I eat, drink or how much I exercise.\u00a0\u00a0I thought diabetes was a little more cut and dry then this.\u00a0\u00a0I thought fewer carbs, lower blood sugar. It's just not the case.Thanks again,Justina",
