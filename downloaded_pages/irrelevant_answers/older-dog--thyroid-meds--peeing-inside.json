            "answer": "There are several possibilities.He may have\u00a0\u00a0more than one endocrine disorder, or a disease that is unrelated.The side effects of thyroid replacement therapy include increased defectation but not increased urination, however if his dose of thyroid medication is too high it could increase drinking and therefore increased urination, but this is low on the list.The following is the list of possibilities:1.\u00a0\u00a0He may have Cushing's syndrome (hyperadrenocorticism) in addition to hypothyroid.2.\u00a0\u00a0He may have diabetes mellitus (insulin deficiency) or diabetes insipidus (difficulty concentrating urine).3.\u00a0\u00a0Renal disease or failure, or urinary tract infection.4.\u00a0\u00a0Urinary incontinence.Your vet will be able to perform the appropriate tests to figure out the cause of the problem.In the mean time take the water bowl up at 6:00 or 7:00PM so that he will not get you up at night to have to urinate.Good luck!",

            "answer": "You need to have your vet check his kidney function.\u00a0\u00a0Go back to the vet and bring along a urine sample.\u00a0\u00a0He may have developed a urinary tract infection or kidney problem unrelated to the thyroid issues.\u00a0\u00a0If you can't get the sample to the vet in about an hour, it can be stored in the refrigerator.I wouldn't limit water intake right now because he's obviously drinking for a reason.\u00a0\u00a0If his kidneys are the issue, his body needs the additional water even though it appears to be going straight through him.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't get a diagnosis from your current vet, don't hesitate to consult another one.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes it just takes a different pair of eyes to get results.\u00a0\u00a0Hang in there!",

    "question": "My 9-year-old Golden Retriever has always been the best behaved dog in our household. He never went inside before going on thyroid medication. He would patiently wait for us no matter what to do his business outside.He got very fat, over 150 pounds, and the doctor said his thyroid was off the charts. He has lost about 20 pounds and looks much better. But he laps up water all the time.He is now peeing inside the house - and a lot of pee, not just a little. My husband took him outside three times this morning, and he peed inside about noon. It took a roll of paper towels to get all of it.What can we do? Should we limit water intake?We don't believe it is a behavioral problem because he has been such a good dog all these years, it has to be related to his medicine. But we asked the doctor and he said it was not the medicine.Help, we can't keep this up.",
