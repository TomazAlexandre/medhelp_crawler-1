    "question": "Ok so this is my story question.I am a very safe guy when it comes to sex and its just this one occasion that i am super freaked out about.I had sex( She was Female and I am Male) with a friend (she is HIGHLY promiscuous)\u00a0\u00a0Protected until the condom split during intercourse (Vaginal) I noticed within one minute (probably 45 seconds to be precise) and withdrew. However I am pretty sure she was menstruating because i had blood on my penis i washed off some hours later in the shower at home. Now on to the symptoms. Ok I know symptoms are not diagnostic of HIV however i had quite a few with regards to ARS. The date i am posting this from my exposure is now 11 weeks. At this exact time i also decided to quit smoking and smoking marijuana also. So From day 14 of exposure I started to feel really off a Malaise type feeling and it progressively got worse into loss of appetite which was gradual and then high temperatures or a feeling of being overwhelmingly hot. (i am not sure if it was fever i have never had one in my life as to what seems to be described as one) I felt unbelievably nauseous\u00a0\u00a0and i didnt want to even smell food it made me feel violently sick. I did not have headaches or muscle aches or sore throat. I didnt eat for 4 days and all this stayed the same for about 2 weeks the worst part of it being 7 - 9 days in. I didn't feel very sociable it was kind of a struggle to go anywhere because of the extreme anxiety and worry and way i was feeling but i was still going about my daily life (cycling around to do shopping mostly walking though however i still felt really awful). I had mild diarrhoea i dont know if this was because i hadnt eaten for 4 days but i did have it 4 days after not eating for 4 days. I was rapidly waking at night and also had night sweats on and off during this time (yes actual dripping sweats feeling cold when woken up and having to get a towel to lie back down on or swapping the duvet around to the dry end Since 90% of the time i have from chest and head only) After 4 weeks i was starting to feel slightly better and started to regain a little appetite. I had a blood test through my doc at 4 weeks since possible infection and im pretty certain she didn't include HIV but just everything else I.E diabetes thyroid hepatitis A B and C also provided urine cultures for Chlamydia and gonorrhoea. Still though the night sweats continued with nearly all symptoms resolving after 6 weeks of exposure I received blood results at this time too everything was normal. So being over critically worried and noticing i had lost an awful lot of weight (14lbs) up until this stage i booked a appointment at my local clinic for an HIV test which i took at eight weeks to the day. Still of course loosing a little weight and having night sweats. The clinic said to me no news is good news so if you dont hear anything in 2 weeks everything is clear (they tested for everything too) so now today i am currently at my 11 week mark from day of exposure and i am going for a FINAL blood test on week 12 day for this horrible ordeal to hopefully be over. I just want to know if this does sound like an ARS situation to anyone out there who has unfortunately gone through it or would be kind enough to help. I have cross referenced everything from HIV to cancers to General Anxiety Disorder to OCD to smoking withdrawal and even Diabetes I am so distraught and If it just happens to be that i do turn out positive this is clear information and symptoms of what one might expect. Hopefully i wont but please anyone who is out there could you please lend an eye and some heart and not come back at me with Go get a 3 month test to be conclusive and HIV doesn't have any symptoms that are defining. One last thing is that i think now my lymph nodes are swollen in my groin area or may have been for awhile i found out about that too and started feeling around and can feel some small squishy non tender nodes in my inguinal area under the skin there is no redness around them. Thank you to anyone and god bless you. I hope one day that there is a cure for this horrible disease and when i get my results i will post back whatever happens and if it is negative (which I damn well hope so) then I feel right as to donate blood to someone who needs it most. I never take advantage of medical services but this time was a must and i am so frightened.JUnited KingdomAged 22",
