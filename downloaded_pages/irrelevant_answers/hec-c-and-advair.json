            "answer": "As in all cases it depends upon how advanced your liver disease is and your total health status.http://www.rxlist.com/advair_diskus-drug.htm\"Advair is an inhaled medicine used to treat lung diseases. Manufacturer GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) advises that all users of its Advair Diskus who have liver problems consult their physician before using the product. GSK has received a flurry of negative reports regarding the effects of its diabetes medication, Avandia,SignificanceGSK's Medication Guide advises that anyone with liver problems consult with their physician before taking Advair. The guide also states that no hepatic or renal testing has been performed on the medication despite the admission that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) have received abnormal liver function tests after having taken Advair.ConsiderationsIn 2008, a joint medical panel of members from the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes released a statement advising against the use of GSK's diabetes medication, Avandia. This came one year after public charges of cardiac and liver safety were leveled against GlaxoSmithKline regarding the drug. GSK continues to maintain that Avandia is no less a threat to the liver than its competitors.\"Hector",

            "answer": "I have not seen a medication yet that didn't have a warning about \"if you have liver disease consult your doctor\" .Advair has a small amount of steroid in it so it could be detrimental to someone with HCV/ liver disease. I remember some theories that steroids could \"wake up\" the HCV. People had HCV lay dormant for 20-30 years then after a bout of steroids for something not related to HCV they started to have the HCV symptoms shortly thereafter.",
