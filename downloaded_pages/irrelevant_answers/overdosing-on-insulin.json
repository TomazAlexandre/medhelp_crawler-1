            "answer": "Hello rshell and thank you for posting.\u00a0\u00a0My heart goes out to your friend.\u00a0\u00a0What a tragedy.I need you to know that I am not a medical professional, but a mother of a 10 yr. old diabetic who was diagnosed at age 3.\u00a0\u00a0My son is on the pump.My son has the type of pump that you program information into such as 1 unit of insulin per x amount of carbs, etc.\u00a0\u00a0So, he does not have to do the math.\u00a0\u00a0He simply enters his blood sugar and then enters the amt. of carbs and the pump will figure out how much insulin to give him.\u00a0\u00a0We do have limits set, so he cannot give over a certain amount at one time.\u00a0\u00a0I am not familiar with all pumps.When you say he had a problem controlling it after dinner, are you saying he was having lows or highs?It is my understanding that if a type 1 diabetic has High BG and ketones, they can go into ketoacidosis and if not treated, they can die, however, I do not believe this would happen in a few hours unless the person was not giving insulin all day long OR unless the person had high ketones all day and could not get his BG down, but I still think that unless the BG was over 600 and not registering on the glucometer, that ketoacidosis would not happen in a couple of hours.\u00a0\u00a0(unless no insulin was being given at all)\u00a0\u00a0If I am incorrect, please, anyone comment and enlighten us.Here is some info. about ketoacidosis:Ketoacidosis usually develops slowly. But when vomiting occurs, this life-threatening condition can develop in a few hours. The first symptoms are:Thirst or a very dry mouthFrequent urinationHigh blood glucose (sugar) levelsHigh levels of ketones in the urineNext, other symptoms appearConstantly feeling tiredDry or flushed skinNausea, vomiting, or abdominal pain (Vomiting can be caused by many illnesses, not just ketoacidosis.\u00a0\u00a0If vomiting continues for more than 2 hours, contact your health care provider.)A hard time breathing (short, deep breaths)Fruity odor on breathA hard time paying attention, or confusionBelow is pertaining to severe Low Blood Sugar_________________________________________________I have heard of diabetics going to bed okay and having a severe low during the night and their loved one finding in the moring they had passed away.\u00a0\u00a0This is a horrible thought and I am so sorry to hear about your friend's dad.\u00a0\u00a0I truly am.Please copy and paste the link below to read about something called \"Dead in the Bed Syndrome\"\u00a0\u00a0This is what I was taling about when I said having severe low blood sugar during the night.\u00a0\u00a0This might shed some light, but, please remember, I am not a medical professional.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I am SO VERY SORRY for your loss.http://www.childrenwithdiabetes.com/d_0n_g00.htmWarm Regards,SS",

            "answer": "Hello...I am so sorry for your loss. I was frightened for the first time going to sleep last night because I was running low and my fiance just got a new job, so he won't be here during the night. I remembered your post. I think your post helped me to realize to be more careful. It's scary, but I did find a way to face the fear and eventually get to sleep (at around 3:30am). I have nine cats. We usually keep them out of the bedroom, but I let them in last night. I have a couple that consistently will wake me up if I start to act funny. I've got one 14 year old cat that yowls in my face until I wake up. Inevitably I discover something amiss. I also checked frequently and ate a pre-bed snack. Does anyone else out there have a furry companion who helps them feel safer? I've seen seizure alert dogs, etc. I guess I have seizure alert cats. I don't gamble and not check and depend on the cats; I check, but they have also caught the surprises. I wish you quick healing in your heart from what has happened...I know it's got to hurt.",
