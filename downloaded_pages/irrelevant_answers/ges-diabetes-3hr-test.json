            "answer": "I was told to fast from midnight on for my 3 hrs. So try not to eat or drink anything. Your one hour number is not super high so you might just pass this one. Bring some snacks with you for after the test in case you got really weak afterward. I was pretty sick to my stomach after drinking that sugar drink and got poke so many time with needles.Plus I made the mistake of picking the fruit punch flavor one which is so gross. I will stick to the orange if I have to redo.Well, good luck on your test tomorrow.",

            "answer": "I think the fasting for the 3 hr test might depend on when you take it. I was told fast for 12 hours. So I stopped eating at 8 pm and went to take it at 8 am. But the doctor or clinic might tell you different. I also was off by just a number or two on my 1 hour test so I'm positive you'll come out fine for the 3 hr one. And yesss, bring snacks afterwards. I wish I had because I was feeling soo woosey and could eat a whole elephant afterwards lol Good luck.",
