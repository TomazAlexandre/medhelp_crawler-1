Normal fasting levels should be between 80 and under 100.\u00a0\u00a0Did you doctor order the test?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a history of diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0Did you test at home?If this is brand new, you need to contact your doctor, and have a full work-up, which will include other lab tests, like an A1c, which gives a picture of what the blood glucose is over a period of a few months, versus just at one point in time.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor will likely do some other testing as well.Once the results of all the tests come back, your doc can sit you down and tell you what you're looking at, if you are indeed a diabetic, pre-diabetic, or if there is another concern, and then discuss with you what to do about it.Call and make yourself an appointment.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us updated!",
