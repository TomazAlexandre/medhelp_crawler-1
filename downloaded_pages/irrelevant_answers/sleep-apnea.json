            "answer": "That depends. Do you have a copy of your sleep study results? If you have mild sleep apnea, there is a possibility a dental device could help, but those are expensive too. Some are helped with surgery, but many find after surgery they still need cpap.Hardly anyone gets used to wearing a mask to breathe in a night or two. Some take weeks and have to try several masks to get one that's right for them. But the benefits from toughing it out till adjusted make it worth the effort... decreased cardiac, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension risks. For some, improved sexual function, fewer headaches, and general improvement of quality of life - not to mention safety issues of driving impaired.If after evaluating your other possible options you decide to try cpap again, they can often be found used for a real deal. There are online sources too but your doctor will have to give you a prescription. There are even cpap auctions. It doesn't have to be an expensive treatment. You have been diagnosed and titrated, so any machine set to your prescribed pressure should be fine. Just do some reading before choosing a machine - they're not all alike.Good luck at whatever you choose to do, but please do something.",
