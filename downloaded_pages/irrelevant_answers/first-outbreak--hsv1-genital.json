            "answer": "dermoplast spray ( the blue can for the genital area, not the red can ) is helpful. It's under $10 at most drugstores and you spray it on to provide pain relief.epsom salts are also very cheap and throwing some of them into the bath tub and soaking will help too.the first ob is the worst and recurrences will be far milder.\u00a0\u00a0 typically hsv1 genitally doesn't reoccur very often at all - your diabetes really won't be an issue for making it reoccur more often either.keep asking questions :)grace",

            "answer": "Thank you for your advice! My doctor's office called to confirm this morning that it is indeed GHSV-1. The weekend was so painful, but today seems to be better! The lesions have \"popped\" and I'm trying to keep everything dry and cleaned out to heal faster. It doesn't seem to be burning incessantly anymore, which is the biggest relief.I am really happy to have official confirmation because I think maybe my husband will start to understand that I didn't cheat on him, and that it really is possible to transfer it to another person without having cold sores physically present at that moment.\u00a0\u00a0It's been very hard because this is the last thing I expected to ever happen and in this way that it happened, and to have no support, especially from the person who should be supportive, has been trying.\u00a0\u00a0Being in such pain and sobbing to have no one comfort you because they thought you cheated on them when they contributed is just as painful as the lesions :(Do any of you take the suppressive daily medicine to lessen the chance of outbreaks? I'm considering taking it for this first year to help in any way I can because I really can't deal with this 4-6 times more this year! I know GHSV1 is less likely to recur often, but I'm a very stressed out person so I'm worried along with the immune system issues that I'll break out every few months.Thank you so much for your advice. Buying the spray asap for the discomfort that is still present! Thanks again so much!",

            "answer": "hsv1 genitally doesn't reoccur that often. we don't even recommend suppressive therapy for it. About half of folks never get another recurrence. Of those who do, the average is 1 additional ob the first year and then 1 ob every other year.http://www.ashastd.org/std-sti-works/Herpes/oral-herpes.html\u00a0\u00a0has terrific information on oral herpes. perhaps your spouse reading that will better convince him that symptoms don't have to be present to be shedding the virus actively and transmit it to a partner either orally or genitally.",

    "question": "So....my husband gave me HSV 1 for Valentine's Day..... he has oral HSV 1 but was showing no symptoms and we had oral sex. I now have genital HSV 1 and I'm very upset, and in so much pain. I never expected this to be possible because we have been together for 8 years in a monogamous relationship. 3 days after we were intimate, I began to feel strange and when I saw the first bumps, my doctor basically confirmed and now I'm certain. This seems like a death sentence to me bc I also have Type 1 diabetes and I'm afraid I will have many outbreaks bc of my immune system's issues.Is there anything else that soothes the blisters? It's unbearable. I've been pacing around screaming and sobbing for 3 days. I'm taking antivirals and acetaminophen and it seems to help after th medicine but the pain resumes and is excruciating.My husband has yet to be sympathetic which makes me very angry.How long will the first outbreak last generally? I am in misery.",
