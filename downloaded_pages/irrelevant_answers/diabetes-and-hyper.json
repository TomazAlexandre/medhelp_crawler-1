            "answer": "There are a few links between diabetes and thyroid disease -- hyperthyroidism increases blood sugar and in many cases both are caused by the immune system attacking the body (pancreas in diabetes and thyroid in Graves/Hashimoto's).Certainly testing glucose (sugar) levels would sort this out.\u00a0\u00a0But your symptoms may all be from hyperthyroidism or possibly side-effect of the anti-thyroid medication (esp nausea, muscle/joint pain).",
