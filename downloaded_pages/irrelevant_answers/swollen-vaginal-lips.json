            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You could be having chronic yeast infection. Yeast infection or thrush is at times very difficult to treat. You may need to take oral antifungal pills twice a week for 3-4 weeks along with local application of antifungal cream. There are many types of antifungals available. Take an OTC antifungal with a combination of two or more anti fungals. Use both oral and local application. At times both partners need to be treated. Test for diabetes and other STDs as presence of either or both can make it difficult to treat the fungal infection. Discuss this with your gynecologist.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
