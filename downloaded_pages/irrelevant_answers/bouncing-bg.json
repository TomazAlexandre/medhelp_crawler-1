            "answer": "Hello,yes, insulin is the best option if you need to control blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0It is hard work, but it is worth it for a h ealthy baby.After the baby is born you may be able to go back to oral meds / dietary management, or in some cases it is necessary to stay on insulin. It just depends on how well you can control your blood sugar.After my pregnancy, I chose to stay on insulin as it gave me excellent control (much better than oral meds).\u00a0\u00a0However, in my case I would have been on insulin sooner than later anyway, I guess.",
