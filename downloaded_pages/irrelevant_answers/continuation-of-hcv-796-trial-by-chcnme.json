            "answer": "I feel your pain!\u00a0\u00a0I'm been all weepy today myself.\u00a0\u00a0I just got so depressed over this who records thing.\u00a0\u00a0I had another hope built up that the records I was picking up from the retired doctor's (the office he sold his practice to when he retired) office, would be the ticket.\u00a0\u00a0That for sure, it would show what I was looking for.\u00a0\u00a0What a bust.\u00a0\u00a0I just started crying and crying.\u00a0\u00a0I just don't even want to hope about this anymore because I keep on getting the hopes built up and then come crashing down when the records don't come to be.\u00a0\u00a0I'll get like one line here and there, just enough to prove that I'm not crazy and that I was on Peg-Intron a 2nd time in 2003-2004 and then, nothing else.\u00a0\u00a0It's driving me insane.\u00a0\u00a0I have a record from the lawyer's who handled my S.S.D.I. where it has a list of all the record's obtained and shows that this particular doctor was my Dr. during those years and that one of the meds listed, surprise, surpise was Peg-Intron. I called the lawyer's office and they're not even sure they still have those old documents still in the warehouse.\u00a0\u00a0I called the pharmacy, where I thought it possibly might have been purchased (not kept past 1-1/2 years.).\u00a0\u00a0I had a letter from the insurance company for authorization of paying for the Peg-Intron for 2003-2004.\u00a0\u00a0So, I called them and of course, they now can't find it in their computer and have to go and research it, when I KNOW that they have the DAD GUM records because they wrote the dumb letter!! I have a huge stack of records regarding the Infergen (which is not what Vertex needs).\u00a0\u00a0By the time all these people did up my records, it's going to be too late to get into ANY of these trials.\u00a0\u00a0I'm so down about all of it.\u00a0\u00a0Now is the time for me to do this because my viral load is at a manageable level and not when it jumps up a by about 6 or 7 million more copies!\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I know that I know that I know that things could be a lot worse.\u00a0\u00a0I am not doing as bad as some others are, but I'm SOOOO frustrated by the whole thing.\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, thanks for letting me unload AGAIN!\u00a0\u00a0 Susan",

            "answer": "Some how I got in the VX-950 trial at Hershey , Pa. I know I am getting the peg and ribivirin. The VX-950 I think is real , getting some different sides than I got with the 48 weeks of peg and ribivirin. Was told to take the VX with food, did not do that one time and really got a queasy stomach. Also started getting rashes which I never got on the regular tx. I go the Hershey once and week , sometimes they take a couple of vials of blood other times they take 6-8 vials. Not sure when I find out what the deal is with the VX or what my viral load is. One thing the the beloved virus did for me is bring on diabetes. Now for some reason my sugar numbers are staying near or at normal level with no or reduced meds. The nurse at Hershey said it could be the VX is reducing the inflamtion in my liver to the point helping with the diabetes, who knows. Really tempted to go to a new doc and get some blood work done to find out how the old viral load is doing. If I eat like some cereal, crackers my stomach is fine, not noticing any othe sides. Actually this time around the sides to the peg and ribivirin do not seem to be as bad, still not a walk in the park. If you go on Vertex web site the success rate is really something. This stuff should be on the market soon after the trial is over. Hershey has 10 people on VX and none have dropped out because of sides. Hang in there the calvary is on the wayPaul",
