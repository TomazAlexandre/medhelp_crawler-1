            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Unexplained aches and pains coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD/menopause. This needs a comprehensive investigation including blood tests. Consult a doctor please (who is treating ulcerative colitis) and a gynecologist too. Take care!",

            "answer": "Smoking is the main appearently problem. UC doesn't react with pain unless the cigar components react with the symptoms. Also the side-effects of the drug can cause this. UC cures are hard to find and tideous to make. The only way to cure UC is through the modern tamiflu. UC is really part of the hidden virus gene that can mutate into a worse case such as HIV or SARS. Beware of radiational leaks in Japan. The radiation also can cause diseases similar to UC.",
