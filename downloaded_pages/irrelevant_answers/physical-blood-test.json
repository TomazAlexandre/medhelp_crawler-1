Blood tests are usually indicated to determine if there is infection present in the blood, anemia, or other conditions such as diabetes, hypertension,gout, and many others. The blood needed for a the test is obtained through a procedure called venipuncture and the person performing this procedure is called a phlebotomist. A needle is inserted\u00a0\u00a0through your skin into a vein, usually found in the elbow crease. To visualize the veins, a torniquet may be applied above the site.\u00a0\u00a0The amount of blood needed for the test is withdrawn through the needle into a special tube or tubes. The tubes are sent to a laboratory where the blood is analyzed.\u00a0\u00a0The procedure usually takes less than 3 minutes. Afterward,a gentle pressure may be applied\u00a0\u00a0to help the blood clot and prevent swelling and a hematoma.Take care and keep us posted.",
