            "answer": "Hi,Muscle twitching can be seen in normal individuals as well. If there is no associated weakness present, these are usually benign.Numbness/ tingling is caused due to disorders of nerves supplying a particular part of the body. If the hand is effected, it may be due to cervical vertebral disease, carpal tunnel syndrome, diabetes, hypothyroidism, vitamin deficiency.Cramps can be caused by peripheral vascular disease, calcium and other mineral deficiency and sometimes, parathyroid disease.Having said this, it is difficult to say whether your symptoms are all reated to one another or not. You may visit a neurologist or an orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation.Do get back with ant other queries.Regards",

            "answer": "Thank you for the information you supplied.\u00a0\u00a0I know that I am not diabetic and I know that my thyroid and vitamin levels are good. We did a few tests for carpal tunnel but seeing how the numbness and tingling are from the elbow down now would make me have to wonder about that.\u00a0\u00a0My Dr doesn't think that it is that either.\u00a0\u00a0I will read up on this other information that you gave me.\u00a0\u00a0I do finally have an appointment with a Neurologist but it isn't for another month.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you once again.",
