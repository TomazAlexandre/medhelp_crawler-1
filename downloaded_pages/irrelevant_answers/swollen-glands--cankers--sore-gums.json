            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Generally canker sores are harmless. They come and go. They respond to cortisone cream and pain killers and disappear within 14 days. It can get complicated in the presence of deficiency of vitamin B12, folic acid, or iron. Presence of sugar in blood as in diabetes can cause\u00a0\u00a0Streptococcus bacteria to grow rapidly. This can result in swollen glands. Also it may not be canker sores but cold sores caused by Herpes virus. Please talk to your doctor and get tested for the problems mentioned. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
