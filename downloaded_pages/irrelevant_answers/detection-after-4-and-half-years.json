    "question": "Hello Doctor,Is there a possibility of hiv undetected that means hiv becoming negative after 4 and half years of possible exposure.6 months before i tested for it but it came negative. i had lost some weight and muscles. Family members in are experiencing problems like loss of weight, fever, diabetes. My eye sight becoming blur and i can see large number of floaters and blinking white spots in the visual field (might be blue field entoptic phenamenon) that might be symptoms of CMV retinitis that is the only possible clue in front of me for the detection of hiv. because cmv will activate in the presence of hiv.so please help me by providing medication for at least to prevent transmission of cmv of hiv if i had it to other. because cmv transmits through body fluids.",
