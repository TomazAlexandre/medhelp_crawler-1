It is a difficult condition to treat and avoidance of warm or heat stimulus is the main treatment. In addition, medical treatment consists of antihistamines( like cetrizine),H2-receptor antagonists such as cimetidine and in some cases, tricyclic antidepressants.Please follow your doctor\u2019s prescription and if the symptoms are severe then please consult a dermatologist.I hope it helps.

    "question": "Hi,I had this problem for long as i can remember but cannot find the symptom online. I try to make this precise as I can.Example: if the climate is cold let say in the winter and I was running for a bus or walking for hours my body temperature rises as you would do and I then have this irritating tingling sensation on my skin on the area where the sweat would eventually build up. After a few minutes where the sweat eventually builds up the tingling sensation is gone this is because the sweat had already formed I believe. If I was in a warmer climate let say in the summer where my body temperature is warm then I never have this problem. .I also suffer from hives problems which isn\u2019t a problem to what I have here.Does anyone have this problem as I couldn\u2019t find this anywhere online. Thanks",
