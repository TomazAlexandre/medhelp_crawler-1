            "answer": "Hey Cheyenne,Unfortunately, fatigue is very common issue for pwMS day to day basis as well as during relapses but there are a plethora of other causes of fatigue and because you already have a dx of sleep apnea and have consciously been loosing weight (well done btw), you've got two potential explanations already.Most of the more common causes (eg vitamin deficiency - Iron, vit B, diabetes, hypoglycaemia, infections etc\u00a0\u00a0etc) can easily be exclude with basic blood tests, and i think it would be a good idea to see your family doctor to get it check out, 'just in case' there is something amiss that you can tweek to get back to normal.Cheers..........JJ",

    "question": "Hi all...Has anyone had severe fatigue be the main/only symptom in a relapse??I have literally been falling asleep while driving to work in the mornings (AFTER 2 lg coffees),having to take a nap at lunch (I only did this one other time 6 years ago bf I knew I had sleep apnea, which the dr and I feel is resolved now since losing 90 pounds). I feel better at times, like while working, but as soon as I'm just sitting I'm ready to pass out.My other symptoms I have had are some pins and needles in my face especially around my left eye (where I had abnormal VEP in feb, but was normal beg. Of May), and some tingling/numbness/buzzing in legs up to belly button, and I feel like my eyesight is getting worse...Any info/experience would be appreciated...Thanks:) Cheyenne",
