            "answer": "First, a warning -- there are about a half-dozen major B vitamins with another dozen related molecules that comprise the entire B-comple. The B vitamins have names like niacin (b3), thiamine (b1), folic acid (b9), cyanocobalamin (b12), and others. Each performs a different metabolic function.I believe you may have misheard your doctor. I can't think of a disorder where all B vitamins would be high and you probably do not want to lower all of your B vitamin levels.Here the devil is in the details -- get the correct diagnosis from your doctor, and ask if nutritional counseling (with a registered dietician) will help you get these levels under control.For example, high niacin (B3) levels can cause the \"niacin flush\" with accompanying vasodilation, tingling, pins-and-needles, and itching. Elevated B9 levels (folic acid) can mask a B12 deficiency that leads to nerve damage.Please call and ask your doctor or his nurse to be specific about exactly which B vitamin is out of whack, and perhaps an idea of what to do about it.",

            "answer": "If you are taking any vitamin supplements that also contain Vitamin B, then the first thing you need to do is to stop taking it.\u00a0\u00a0So do check the packet any supplements that you are taking.There is nothing that you can take to get the vitamin decrease.\u00a0\u00a0It will do that in time and I did read that B12 is excreted in the urine if there is too much, but my pain management doctor seemed to think otherwise.Pins and needles in the hands can be referred from impingement of nerves in the cervical area of your spine (neck).\u00a0\u00a0Pins and needles in the hands can also be caused by impingement of nerves in the carpal tunnel.\u00a0\u00a0So it would be worth getting a nerve conduction test done to find out if it is due to carpal tunnel problems.Pins and needles in the feet can be referred from problems in the lower back or from nerve damage which can happen with people who have diabetes and don't control their sugar levels properly.The first time I experienced pins and needs in my feet was due to a kidney stone - which baffled my doctors.",

            "answer": "It is good that you are drinking lots of water, but don't drink \"tons\" :)You can overdo it on water and that can be just as dangerous as getting dehydrated.2 litres a day is usually recommended, more if you sweat a lot.Personally I would NOT drink more than 6 pints, which is approximately 3 litres.\u00a0\u00a0Don't forget that you will also get fluids from high content fruit and veg.The web link below gives information on the foods that contain Vitamin B6 which is a water-soluble vitamin.\u00a0\u00a0It is also known as pyridoxinehttp://www.dietitians.ca/Your-Health/Nutrition-A-Z/Vitamins/Food-Sources-of-Vitamin-B6-(Pyridoxine).aspxI use Epsom Salts too.\u00a0\u00a0My 10KG bucket arrived this morning.\u00a0\u00a0I shopped around and found one that was much cheaper.I use 2 large cups in my bath of water and some baby oil, sometimes some coconut oil as well as pine oil (the pine oil helps with any congestion).You need a little oil in the bath water with the Epsom salts, because on its own it is very drying to the skin.Make an appointment to see your doctor and get your hand checked for any carpel tunnel problem and your foot for any referred pain from your lower back.Diabetes can cause nerve pain (pins and needles).\u00a0\u00a0Even pre diabetes or glucose intolerance can damage nerves even before you get to find out that you have this.\u00a0\u00a0Ask your doctor to arrange for you to have a glucose test to find out if this may be the cause of your pins and needles.",
