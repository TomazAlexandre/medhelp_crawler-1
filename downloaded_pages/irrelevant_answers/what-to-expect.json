            "answer": "First welcome to the forum, as for starting tomorrow the answer is no. It sounds like you do need to treat and looks like triple treatment is your best bet... Its best to do a little research and decide which of the new PI's would be best for you, either Incivek or Victrelis. Your doctor can help you there.Don't be concerned about your high viral load, since you state you have cirrhosis you will be looking at 48 weeks of treatment. You have time to make sure you get your ducks in a row, find out how he treats side efeects and if he uses rescue drugs. Try and learn as much as you can, read here and ask questions as there are many of us either treating or now done. Just hang in there, wishing you the best.",

            "answer": "\u00a1Ahoy! Welcome to the Forum. It is unlikely you will start treat tomorrow. Your treating doctor will likely want to perform an assessment.Meanwhile you would still need patient education, base line labs, visual acuity, and certain other assessments if you have not had them (e.g., cardio, Diabetes, Mental Health), discuss treatment options & management and/or other administrative business.It is customary for your Hepatitis C medication to be filled and delivered to your house by a specialty pharmacy for injectibles rather than a pharmacy you might use for other meds.As Can-do mentioned deciding which Protease Inhibitor you will treat with is key. I encourage you to not make a decision on the spot tomorrow no matter how much sense the doctor makes. You deserve the chance to read about both meds and learn what it would be like to treat with either one of them as well as Pro/Con and the side effects._____________Gather all your copies of your labs, reports and medical documentation. Keep them together. This might take a day or two but be sure you have all these documents.Best of Luck & take it easy \u266b",
