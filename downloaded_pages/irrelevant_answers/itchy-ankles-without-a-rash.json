            "answer": "Hi,This itchiness or known medically as pruritus may be due to several factors. Differentials shall include genetic and autoimmune factors like allergies. Also environmental or external triggers like extreme temperatures, heat, dust and chemicals need to be considered. Importantly, internal disease conditions which may manifest as pruritus need to be ruled out.In your case, you have mentioned of hypothyroidism and clotting disorders. Would you be able to elaborate more on these clotting disorders?Also ,is your hypothyroidism well managed and the thyroid hormone levels well controlled?",

            "answer": "Thanks for taking time to help me.\u00a0\u00a0In March I suffered my 2nd miscarriage (I have 3 healthy kids) and given that my sister had recently had a blood clot in the lung, my OB thought it prudent to run some tests.\u00a0\u00a0He discovered that I have MTHFR and Factor V Leiden clotting disorders.\u00a0\u00a0For now I am on low-dose aspirin and Metanx.He also checked my TSH which was 2.74 in October.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH had risen to 3.11 in April.\u00a0\u00a0He increased my dosage of synthroid from 50 mcg to 75 mcg about 2 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0I have to go back to be re-tested in another couple of weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I've read that up to 4.0 is in the \"normal\" range; however, I also saw that if you do have a problem, your TSH should be kept under 2.0.\u00a0\u00a0My OB consulted an endocrinologist who said he too preferred to keep the TSH close to the low end.I had allergy testing done shortly after this problem first started and was taking bi-weekly \"maintenance\" shots until 2 weeks ago (my decision to stop due to the SLIGHT chance that it contributed to my miscarriage).\u00a0\u00a0I had several allergies, but not a lot and none were extremely severe.\u00a0\u00a0This problem does not seem to coincide with my seasonal allergies and I am not an \"outdoor\" person.\u00a0\u00a0My allergist also confirmed that I have mild asthma.I appreciate anything you have to offer--I am sick to death of itching, scratching (or bruising if I try not to use my nails), sores, and small blood stains on my clothes.",

            "answer": "Hi,I have the feeling that your thyroid problem may be associated with the itching. Continue with your thyroid medications and let us await the results of your thyroid tests. It is best to see how things will be once the thyroid hormones are more stable and maintained.Also, you are not on any allergy medications now?Do you have any known allergies to medications?Any other known conditions like diabetes ?",

            "answer": "Hi,I'm hoping that's all it is and that the increased dosage will help.\u00a0\u00a0So many of the \"problems\" (reduced fertility, m/c, fatigue, weight gain, unable to lose wt, frequent heavy periods, hair loss, etc.) I have seem to trace back to hypothyroidism, but I can't seem to get my doctors to agree with me.\u00a0\u00a0How long do you think it will take for the new dosage to take effect?My allergist recommends Zyrtec since I'm trying to get pregnant again, but it makes me so sleepy, I just can't take it.\u00a0\u00a0I did try using antihistamines at one point, but it didn't seem to do any good.The only med I'm allergic to is Compazine, but I don't tolerate e-mycin very well.Aside from being a little overweight, the clotting disorders, asthma, allergies, and hypothyroidism, I'm relatively healthy.\u00a0\u00a0We have a family history of kidney problems (stones, infections, malformations) on my dad's side, but I've only had 1 bout with a kidney stone in 2001.\u00a0\u00a0All 3 of my kids have suffered from ureteral reflux as well.\u00a0\u00a0Both my parents were diagnosed with diabetes, but not until late in life (60's & 70's), but I don't have it.\u00a0\u00a0I believe the dermatologist checked for that last year.\u00a0\u00a0I never even had gestational diabetes.I'll let you know what the TSH level is in a few weeks.Thanks again.",

First I noticed my feet were swolen, then my ankles started itching so badly they would wake me up every single night.If I put hydrocortisone cream on them and let it soak in before lying down at night, I can usually sleep through the night. That might be worth a shot while you're trying to figure out what the cause is. I definitely want to find out the cause so I can put an end to this misery.",

I recently read online about Aveeno Anti Itch lotion. I figured it was worth a try since it seemed to help a lot of people. I have got to say that it cured my problem completely. I put it on twice a day for a few days just because I thought I would need it. Especially before bed where I was sleeping with my legs out from under the covers since the contact with the sheets increased the itch.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had an itch since I first tried it. I havent put it on for 2 days now. I may wait to see how long I go before it returns but at least I know how to fix it now. Just be sure it says \"Anti Itch\" on the front of the bottle. 4 oz between $6 and $10.\u00a0\u00a0About $10 at CVS and $6 online at Walmart. and Amazon.",
