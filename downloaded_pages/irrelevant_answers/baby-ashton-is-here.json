            "answer": "But then he was out and I heard a little cry and it was completely surreal! My husband got to follow baby around while they spent about 30 minutes stitching me back up. I was then wheeled back to my room and got to see baby about 45 minutes later. We've had a lot of visitors and it has been the perfect day. He makes constant squeaking noises which worried me at first, but his breathing is fine. He hasn't cried since the initial birth. We're trying to get breastfeeding down but he's having trouble staying latched. I'll be in the hospital for the next couple of days. He is such a beautiful baby and I'm on cloud nine being his mama! It's all worth it ladies!! Ashton Dean Thompson is 7.4 lbs and 20 1/2 inches long. He has lots of dark hair and big blue eyes \u2764",

    "question": "I'm so excited to share my story! My doctor was concerned about baby's head size, my gestational diabetes and the fact I was not dilating at all so we scheduled me a C section. I was worried I would feel robbed of the birthing experience, but honestly I couldn't be happier. Justin and I came in at 10:30 a.m. and got prepped with paperwork and such then at 12:30 they took me back to the OR for my spinal block. This is smaller than the epidural so it barely hurt. The numbing medicine they gave first was the only thing I felt. A few minutes after that was administered I started feeling extremely nauseous. I thought I'd puke all over myself. So I told the doctor, they gave me medicine and within a few minutes I was feeling fine! I guess my blood pressure dropped quite a bit. My husband stood at my side and watched the whole surgery. He did amazing. Seconds before they pulled baby out they pushed on my ribs super hard to squeeze him out. This was the most painful part of the procedure. I thought my ribs were all about to snap.",
