            "answer": "I know what it is like, imitrex only worked on me if I took it within a few minutes of onset, any thing after that was useless!! then my Dr put me on fioricet and I think it works better than all the other ones I have tryed, plus unlike IMITREX ,ZOMIG and MAXXOLT you can take it up to 6 times per day! Also my Aunt has terrible migraines all the time she was taking all the imitrex she could get was put on a muscle relaxer called soma , and her headaches are much easier to deal with!!GOOD LUCK! HOPE YOU FEEL BETTER SOON!",

Is your sleep apnea being managed?With regards to your condition, have you been thoroughly assessed with your headaches and were all other conditions ruled out?A cervical spine disorder, hormonal imbalance, eye and ear problems, sinus problems brought about by allergies, musculoskeletal or arthritic problems caused by poor bodily positions may cause headaches. Treatment of the underlying cause will help resolve the problem.Do you have any hypertension or diabetes?Your physician has been using preventive migraine therapy to treat you.

    "question": "I have suffered from migraines for 22 years. I have tried every drug there is. I use imitrex and that seems to help get rid of them sometimes. I have been to Mayos Clinic, allergy clinics, had a hysterectomy, and to a Univ. Hospital. I am at the end of the line. I am getting 2 to 3 a week. The last drug I tried, Verampamil, is what the Mayos Dr. suggested. I did find out I had sleep apnea so now I don't wake up with a migraine. I'm getting older and I'm getting tired of the pain. What else is there to try?",
