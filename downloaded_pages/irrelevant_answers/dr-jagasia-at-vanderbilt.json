            "answer": "Hi, isn't it amazing how far off track doctors can get?\u00a0\u00a0What symptoms were you haveing that made them think of neurological problems?\u00a0\u00a0Well I have Hashimoto's thyroiditis.\u00a0\u00a0I too, had an antibody test done, and found that I had a high reading.\u00a0\u00a0Are you familiar with this?\u00a0\u00a0I am glad to hear that you have finally been referred to a thyroid specialist, maybe you will now find the help you have been searching for.\u00a0\u00a0The Hashimoto's is an auto immune disease in which your own body attacks your thyroid gland, leaving many people Hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0So after all these years and being hypo no one has ever thought to run this test for you?\u00a0\u00a0That is crazy!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0With my Hashimoto's I bounce back and forth between hyper and hypo symptoms, My symptoms include, dizziness, cold and heat intolerance, weight gain, hair loss, dry skin, bloating, fluid retention, muscle and joint aches, headaches, memory loss, brain fog, heart palpitations, anxiety attacks, and chest pain.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I don't have as many and other times i have more symptoms, like I mention I kinda just bounce everywhere.\u00a0\u00a0I know that it is important to start on thyroid medication with Hashimoto's as soon as it is spotted, to help stop the progression of the disease, but it looks like you are already hypo, and have probably been on meds for years.\u00a0\u00a0What dose do you take?\u00a0\u00a0Do they have you on Synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0What was your anitbody score that was flagged high?\u00a0\u00a0Let us know.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of knowledgable people on here that have really helped me alot, they can probably do the same for you.\u00a0\u00a0First step is a dr. that knows what's going on, your on the right track.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the input!\u00a0\u00a0I was dx'ed with hypothyroidism back in the mid 1980's and have been on medication ever since.\u00a0\u00a0I started off on Synthroid, and I think I am on the generic form of it right now.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure of the dosage, but will check.\u00a0\u00a0I am on so many other meds, that I just have to write them down in order to keep track of them.I did lose some weight when I went on the meds initially, have gained some, lost, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Over the years I have had many other medical issues that may or may not be related to auto immune problems.\u00a0\u00a0I had (have?) PCOD, infertility, miscarriages, microscopic blood in the urine (never had gone away, after about 20 or so years), gestational diabetes that is now Type II Diabetes, difficult to control hypertension (I am on every classification of blood pressure meds), anemia (assumed due to heavy periods, but now I am wondering...take OTC iron pills 2x day), low potassium (take presc. for this - assumed due to blood pressure med).Other than that, I have had my gallbladder out, diahrea for five years (started before gallbladder was taken out) and GERD, too.\u00a0\u00a0My neuro problems started about 10 years ago, with what I called \"head rush\" sensations.\u00a0\u00a0They suspected TIA, but all tests were inconclusive.\u00a0\u00a0I was hospitalized for tests, and then remained weak for three weeks after that.\u00a0\u00a0Fasciculations started in 1995 and continue to the present.\u00a0\u00a0Tingling and numbness, altered sensations on some parts of the body; balance problems started in 2003 and are still present.The most recent addition has been myclonus in my left arm, when the muscles are at rest.\u00a0\u00a0It can jerk up to 50-75 times per minute, some times being larger \"jerks\" than others.\u00a0\u00a0The Mirapex that I take for Restless Leg Syndrome (forgot to mention that one) helps it at nighttime, so I can sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I also have mild sleep apnea, according to a recent sleep study.I do have white matter lesions on brain MRI's, which led my local neuro to suspect MS.\u00a0\u00a0The Vandy doc didn't think so, but called me a \"medical mystery\".\u00a0\u00a0He got me right in to the movement disorders doc, who has now referred me over to the endocrinologist.This is getting too long - sorry!\u00a0\u00a0I am only 43 years old, and have a housefull of kids.\u00a0\u00a0I am thankful to not be in pain, although I am limited due to fatigue and other issues.\u00a0\u00a0I do not know the numbers of the lab reports, but will be getting copies of them when I go up there on Wed, if they don't fax them to me before then.\u00a0\u00a0(I like to keep copies of all labs.)The MS doc wanted me to be tested for Celiac Disease, too, but I am going to see if they have a GI doc there that I can go to.\u00a0\u00a0I have not been impressed with the ones here in our hometown - they seem to be stuck on IBS, which I do not feel like I have.Sorry to drag this on.\u00a0\u00a0The thought of actually having answers is intriguing, but I am not going to get my hopes built up.\u00a0\u00a0So many years with no answers...BlessingsRamona",

            "answer": "Jimlow,I looked that up, and it coincides with something the doctor said when he called me.\u00a0\u00a0He said something like, \"Hashimoto's is an autoimmune disease where the body sometimes attacks other parts of the body, too, not just the thyroid. It can even start attacking the brain.\"\u00a0\u00a0Ick.He was quick to reassure me and tell me to not worry, which I am working on.\u00a0\u00a0What treatment is there for the encephalopathy?\u00a0\u00a0I have a hard time taking steriodal treatments, due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I saw that mentioned somewhere.Well, time will tell.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again for the input.BlessingsRamona",

            "answer": "Really dosage varies with each person but how you feel is one of the better monitors also the TSH can be helpful for those already on medication. Thyoid specialists like the AACE, recommend a TSH of btween 1.0 to 2.0 (some like their beloe 1.0, like me)for patients on medication.You may not have the encephalopathy but I do believe they sometimes give short term treatment with the hydrcortisone type steroids like Prenisone and you're right, they are reluctant to treat diabetic people with it due to it causing increase in glucose levels. I'm not sure the other treatments.I bet some of you out there think I'm trying to sound like a Dr. but honestly, I DID NOT REALIZE I had accumulated knowlege in these areas because to this point haven't had to use it. My intensive research was over several years when I was desperately trying to find answers for my own condition and I'm surprized I retained this much of it!",
