            "answer": "DH is SO supportive & feels really positive about IVF!\u00a0\u00a0So, I'm getting over the shock of another hurdle being thrown our way & feeling more positive today :)I mentioned the drug I'm supposed to ask my mom about.\u00a0\u00a0It's called DES.\u00a0\u00a0Here is some info I found online:Diethylstilbestrol (DES)During the 1940s, 1950s and into the 1960s, many pregnant women were given DES by their physicians believing that it would help prevent a miscarriage. Unfortunately, it was eventually found that DES offered no protection against miscarriage but actually caused various birth defects in a woman\u2019s developing child.Women exposed to DES in the womb may have a misshapen uterus that resembles a \u2018T\u2019. Exposure to DES may also cause a woman to have an underdeveloped uterus and be more vulnerable to ectopic pregnancies, premature labor, or having a weak cervix.While some women may have no problems carrying a pregnancy with a T-shaped uterus, the risk of miscarriage does increase, as does the risk of preterm labor. Unfortunately, there is little that can be done for women with a T-shaped uterus. Although there are surgeries available, some women have found them to be of little help. Therefore, it is usually not recommended.My doctor said that by the time I was born, this drug was not supposed to be given, but that some doctors still did.\u00a0\u00a0I doubt it's even a factor for me.\u00a0\u00a0I'll have to see if there are other causes.Anyone else been told they have a T-shaped uterus or heard of DES?",

I am so happy to know that you are pregnant now :) I wish you the most sucessfull pregnancy.About me, I had 3 missed carriage before and one ectupic pregnancy in my left fallupian tube.I have PCO as well.

            "answer": "HiI know this is an old post, but since I found it in 2014, I assume others will, too.The drug DES is connected to the T-shaped uterus some of us have. However, it is NOT the only cause of the T-shape. My mother did not take DES.I believe my T-shape is related to my MODY diabetes, which is caused by a gene malformation. If you have diabetes in your family, and you have a T-shape, it could very well be that your diabetes is a MODY type, which is different than Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes.testing for the abnormality is expensive but could save you a lifetime of incorrect diagnoses, as well as protect your heart and other organs in the future.",

            "answer": "Not quite sure of hearing the T shape...but Mine kind of looks odd too. I got told recently at my specialist appointment when she did an HSG type of procedure (not painful like HSG though) where she injects saline into my uterus via cathetor and takes a vaginal ultrasound to see shapes and clarify any shadows etc, and she told me my uterus is Arcuate shaped (divot on top making it look semi heart shaped) versus Bicornuate or WIDELY separate cavities like my HSG test in November stated. My HSG in November versus my MRI this past July both had conflicting reports so the specialist took it upon herself to do her own type of ultrasound to clarify the shape of my uterus. And while it's not perfect shaped, it's still workable lol. Here is a website that I read up on that helped clear some things up. Maybe it will help you, maybe it won't.http://www.dailykos.com/story/2011/03/06/953052/-Uterine-anomalies-causes-types-and-why-they-matterAs far as this T-shape uterus not allowing enough space, I believe it. Even with mine I question the space of my uterus. The surgery I had last June caused some deformities. She thinks we would be a good candidate for IUI, but the posibilities for multiples even scares me with the current shape of my uterus, yet the doctor doesn't think it's an issue. I honestly believe a 2nd opinion wouldn't hurt you. Good luck to you both, sending strength, patience and prayers your way.",

    "question": "So, I had my HSG on Wed. & the radiologist who did it had a difficult time inserting the catheter & mentioned that my cervix was tilted.\u00a0\u00a0I posted about that, as it was news to me.\u00a0\u00a0Then today we had a consultation with our RE to go over the results & discuss our upcoming iui next week.\u00a0\u00a0Well, it turns out that not only do I have a tilted cervix, but I also have a T-shaped uterus!?\u00a0\u00a0Apparently that means my uterus is too small to carry healthy multiples & so, iui is out due to that risk. I have to say I was disappointed by this news 'cause I was so prepared to move forward with the iui & it's quite a bit of information to digest when you're not expecting it.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently there's a medication that pregnant women were given many years ago to stop bleeding and/or miscarriage & there is a link between that & having a T-shaped uterus.\u00a0\u00a0So, now I have to find out if my mom was given this med 'cause it also carries other risks.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has any information to share, I would really appreciate it!!!We're still hoping for a miracle this cycle (I'm on cd10), but if not our next option is IVF, but only implanting one embryo.Thanks for listening ! :)",
