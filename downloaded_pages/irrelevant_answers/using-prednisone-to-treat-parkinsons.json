I'm weighing the benefits of quality of life versus long term effects of prednisone at the higher dose.",

    "question": "I am interested in Parkinson's research on the use of Prednisone to treat symptoms. My husband has had Parkinson's for about 10 years and recently took 5 days of 20mg. Prednisone tables twice a day for a pinched nerve.\u00a0\u00a0It completely removed his symptoms; he was tremor ... [More] free, clear thinking, strong voice, no walking problems, no slowness - NOTHING!\u00a0\u00a0It was like a miracle.\u00a0\u00a0He is now done with the Prednisone, and is back to where he was before.\u00a0\u00a0There must be something we can do with this information to help people with their symptoms. I stumbled on your site and see someone else has experienced a similar situation with Prednisone.\u00a0\u00a0Is anyone studying this? It seems a shame that Prednisone can remove all symptoms, yet it's not prescribed for PD",
