            "answer": "Hi Spitfire, My A1C was also 6.3 and I am monitoring my glucose levels but am not diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0You want that number to stay under 6%. The A1C comes from a 3 month average of our glucose that can be read from our blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0Here's more -\u00a0\u00a0don't panic, LuluFrom Labstestsonline.org- my favorite test siteWhat does the test result mean?A 1% change in an A1c result reflects a change of about 30 mg/dL (1.67 mmol/L) in average blood glucose. For instance, an A1c of 6% corresponds to an average glucose of 135 mg/dL (7.5 mmol/L), while an A1c of 9% corresponds to an average glucose of 240 mg/dL (13.5 mmol/L). The closer a diabetic can keep their A1c to 6%, the better their diabetes is in control. As the A1c increases, so does the risk of complications.",

            "answer": "I was checking my glucose twice daily for a month and then faxed my numbers to the doctor - on my own I also noted when I ate something that I think would have accounted for the spikes in my sugar.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor was funny when I saw her because they had as much fun reading my\u00a0\u00a0food notes as my glucose numbers - she was especially interested in the Pear Gingerbread Upside Down Cake (it was yummy!).It surprised me my sugar spiked higher from carbohydrates (bread, pasta) than from eating sugar.\u00a0\u00a0it was good for me to see for myself how my body reacted to different foods.\u00a0\u00a0Now I am testing just once a day and still keeping a log that I am supposed to send to her.Both of my parents are borderline with diabetes and really watch what they eat so it's not a surprise that I have to also.\u00a0\u00a0 Right now my numbers usually stay right under 100 so there;s no need for another drug or insulin.\u00a0\u00a0But I definitely have to limit those bad foods, and that includes alcohol- I've seen it spike to 190 with the wrong choices.I hope this helps,Lulu",
