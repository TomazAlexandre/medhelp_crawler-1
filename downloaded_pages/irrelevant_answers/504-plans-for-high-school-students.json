The school would not make accommodations for PSATS, when the kid never had one and now the\u00a0\u00a0 family fighting for the accommodationshttp://www.health.state.ny.us/nysdoh/consumer/diabetes/resource/schools.pdfAlso check out www.childrenwithdiabetes.comThey have a section just for 504 plans, by age and gradeThe things that you have asked for are definitely with in reason and allowed for children with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You can contact your local JDRF, they might be able to put you in touch with another family that has dealt with the same school system and that can help you out.\u00a0\u00a0 We do that at our chapter.I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Please check back with us and let us know how things are going.",

            "answer": "HI Candice!\u00a0\u00a0Just wanted to give you a heads-up when it comes to taking the PSAT.\u00a0\u00a0You need to contact the College Board folks and obtain the necessary paperwork from your daughter's physician in order for her to be able to bring her glucometer, water, juice & snack into the test and also to be able to leave to check her bg if needed.\u00a0\u00a0I found this out very late in the game and had to do some pretty fancy footwork in order to get the approval in time for the test.\u00a0\u00a0She needs to be approved for extended break time, not extended test time.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter's experience was horrible.\u00a0\u00a0The proctor for the exam gave my daughter extended time, instead of extended break time and the College Board called us after the exam and told us that my daughter's scores were voided because of this mistake.\u00a0\u00a0They wouldn't even give me the scores - just a credit for the money we paid to be applied to the next exam.\u00a0\u00a0Just a nightmare.\u00a0\u00a0You need to check all of this out ahead of time and make sure that the school where she's going to be taking the test understands exactly what needs to happen the day of the test.\u00a0\u00a0Please look into visiting the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation website at www.jdrf.org and requesting more information about this topic & other college issues through them.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on their on-line diabetes support team, so if you'd like to talk further with me you can request this there - just ask for gg.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you & your daughter!",

            "answer": "Sorry, just catching up on this question.504 plans are allowed for every diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0There have been several lawsuits about this, most prominently in Virginia, and they have ALL ruled that diabetics qualify for 504s under the serious impairment clause.\u00a0\u00a0Your school district cannot legally deny you a 504, although they will do their best to try, for several reasons.\u00a0\u00a0It's primarily because it limits their liability.\u00a0\u00a0A 504 plan is a legal document from a federal statute, and if something goes wrong during school, with a 504 plan in place they are legally responsible.\u00a0\u00a0But they cannot legally deny you one.\u00a0\u00a0To be honest, the American Diabetes Association does a really good job with legal assistance for this issue.\u00a0\u00a0If your district fights it, I'd give them a call.\u00a0\u00a0They keep lawyers on staff to specifically do that.\u00a0\u00a0JDRF doesn't, we put that money to research.",

            "answer": "You know its incredible what we have allowed diabetes to become. My mother has been type II for about 15 years. It's been a huge factor in the quality of my life. I love her, but it is so extremely difficult to cope with things like low blood sugar reactions and poverty and so many other adversities. I'm 29 and I feel so stressed I think Ive got thyroid imbalance and the adrenal burnout...I'm so sick of it all. And I wouldnt even really have many options for healthcare for her or me. Luckily I have a health plan http://www.mybenefitsplus.com/aagate\u00a0\u00a0if it wasnt for that discount health and dental plan. I wouldn't be able to afford anything...and my mother wouldn't even qualify for any thing...not health or medical... and heardly any type of vision or prescription plan. Its crazy what america has done to its citizens!",

    "question": "Hi,I'm new to the site.\u00a0\u00a0 I have a question about 504 plans - everyone from support groups to Children's Hospital and ADA recommend having one.\u00a0\u00a0I've contacted my school (my daugher is a Sophmore) about setting one up to cover being able to eat/drink in SATs/WASL, having extra time if needed and having excuses absences directly related to diabetes illness or doctors appointments.\u00a0\u00a0I've read the Helping your student with Diabetes Suceed manual and they state the same things I'm asking for but I'm getting resistance from her school counselor.\u00a0\u00a0Does it cost the school for having 504 plans?\u00a0\u00a0 Anyone else faced resistance?Thanks!",
