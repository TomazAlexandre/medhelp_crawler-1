            "answer": "I have to agree with JDRF-VOL-RL that your son's headaches sound worse than those that can accompany hypoglycemia. But I did want to add that low glucose levels do often show themselves with headaches. So if your doctor has no other ideas, it probably doesn't hurt to perhaps get a blood glucose test done on him, ideally while he has one of his headaches. But I agree with JDRF-VOL-RL that these sound more like real migraines than hypo headaches. And, no, headaches are not a symptom of diabetes.",

            "answer": "May I add though not to rule out anything until test are done.I personally have had episodes where I wake up early in the morning with a low and after getting sugar in me I go back to bed. Then when I wake up for work or school I have an excruciating headache that I can't get to go away for the rest of the day. Some days I wouldn't call it a migraine, but there are others that have landed me in bed the rest of the day.",

    "question": "My son who is almost 5 has had migraines for 3 1/2 years now.\u00a0\u00a0Of course we didn't know his head hurt until he was finally able to tell us.\u00a0\u00a0He usually ends up throwing up soon after the migraine, either once or twice, or even to the point of the whole night.\u00a0\u00a0By the next morning he is fine.\u00a0\u00a0His migraines used to be 2 or 3 times a month, but now this year it is to about 2 or 3 a week.\u00a0\u00a0If we give him Motrin as soon as his head hurts, he tends not to throw up.\u00a0\u00a0We've tried to track his eating habits, but haven't seen anything consistent.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be due to hypoglycemia or diabetes?",
