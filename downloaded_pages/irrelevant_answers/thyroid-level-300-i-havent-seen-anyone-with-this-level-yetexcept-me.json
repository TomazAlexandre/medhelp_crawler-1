You DO NEED ONE!\u00a0\u00a0That's the problem with most gp's - they have no right to tell you that.Get to an endo as soon as you can.You said your thyroid level was 300 - was that your tsh?\u00a0\u00a0do you have copies of your tests?\u00a0\u00a0If so, post them\u00a0\u00a0here - we can all help you interpret them.Peace,Charley",

            "answer": "yes...i can beat that....in 93 when i was first diagnosed my tsh was 485 and it took slow increases of over a years time to bring it down to a normal range....and no i dont think that an endo is any more competent of treating thyroid disease than a gp or fp...the ones i had met w/for my daughter were less knowledgeable than the dr i am working w/now.(or less willing to work with you to fix the problem). i think if you find a doc who is willing to work w/you and get you better and not bandaid everything with another drug is more beneficial.",

    "question": "I was admitted to the hospital for dangerously high blood pressure about a year ago. My blood pressure was at 225/128. While they were trying to lower my blood pressure they also discovered from labs taken that my thyroid level was at 300!!!Since then every six weeks my level of levothyroxin has been increased, currently at 225 mcg and they are still going to increase it..my thyroid level was at 57 last month and has now INCREASED...yes increased to 62 this month...I have had all kinds of tests done for all the other symptoms..i requested that i be referred to an endocrinologist, but my primary care dr. says I dont need one. My blood pressure has now been diagnosed as malignant high blood pressure...meaning it wont go down under 160/100 .Ive gained about 45lbs in the last 9 months and I am not losing any even after exercise and diet..My heart is fine and so are my kidneys. I feel swelling in my glands in my neck, Is this a sign of something? I feel ignorant about this disease!!!! Someone please give me some advice.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
