            "answer": "Hello,It can be due to persistent or recurrent urine infection. Recurrent urine infections could be due to various reasons. Most common cause is stones in kidney which is blocking urine pathway. Other causes are changing sexual partners frequently, pregnancy, diabetes and of course childhood infections. The urine can also be due to retention of urine anywhere in its flow due t obstruction. The obstruction can be due to abnormality of structures since birth, stones or diseases like tumors(unlikely). Females are more prone to urine infections. So you should get a ultrasound, CT scan done and also some urine and blood tests.Till then, drink plenty of water and take some anti inflammatory pain killer like Diclofenac or Ibuprofen. If the symptoms worsen then get an evaluation done from a urologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
