            "answer": "HiBreathlessness on exercising could be due to a lung problem or due to a heart problem. Lung problems like asthma, emphysema, bronchitis. Heart problems like valve prolapsed, cardiomyopathies etc.\u00a0\u00a0It could also be due to diabetes, anemia, obesity or a thyroid problem. All these problems can start in early teens. I think your friend should discuss these possibilities with her doctor. She may need to undergo a few tests like blood tests and ultrasound to reach a diagnosis.
