            "answer": "I realized your asking for others who have dealt with this, I have not but you just educated me on this illness...and I am sorry. It looks like none of the medications are without risk. From having a dog with a quick killing cancer, learn what the outcome will be, life span etc. I know you love your dog, just know these answers and know what your willing to go through emotionaly and what is best for your dog. I kept my dog a live for 6 months because I was not ready to let him go. It was the best decision for me, but it was also painful for me always knowing that soon I was going to have to stop the treatment and let him go. With Cushings, it might be that you can treat this conditon and your dog will be fine for several years...I hope this is the case. I kept another dog around that almost died on me three years ago, cost me a lot of money, and she still does as she is always getting ill. I love her and keep doing what I feel is best. Good luck with this and I am sorry that your having to go through all of this.",

            "answer": "Thank you so\u00a0\u00a0much for responding. I appreciate the support. My vet tells me the lifespan for my dog is 18-24 months and that the meds won't extend her life but will improve the quality of her life. I guess I just wanted to know if the experience of other owners confirmed this. Maybe I also wanted someone to say their dog did great and lived for years! Right now she is happy and playful and enjoying her life. I hope that doesn't change for a long time. Thanks again.",

            "answer": "Good advice. As far as I can tell, the vet seems knowledgable. She told me the risks and benefits. She told me not to start the meds until Friday after Thanksgiving because there is the\u00a0\u00a0risk of a crisis up to day 10 and she did not want that to happen on a holiday. She told me to bring Jesse back on day ten for more ACTH levels. She also gave me a supply of prednisone and told me the symptoms to watch out for--that would indicate her\u00a0\u00a0cortisol bottoming out--and to stop the Vetoryl, give the prednisone, and\u00a0\u00a0call the on-call vet at once. Jesse is 58 pounds, and she is starting with a lower than recommended dose of 30 mg daily in order to try to avoid some side effects. You are exactly right--I won't regret giving it my best shot. I want to know I did everything I could for her. Thanks for your reply.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reassurance. It helps me know my faith in my vet is justified. Before I switched to her I had a vet I had to beg to do anything beyond annual vaccinations. I had to diagnose Jesse's hypothyroidism from researching the internet and got him to do the lab test by sitting in the exam room and refusing to leave until he drew the sample. Oddly enough, the result was almost at panic value. After he ignored my dachshund's heart murmur until she was in end stage heart failure and she died in my\u00a0\u00a0lap while driving to the emergency clinic I decided I had to make a change. So I certainly understand your frustration with your vet. Thank you so much for taking the time to send the supportive comments. Jesse's first dose is 3 days away and I will keep you posted.",

I know there is a technical term for these but I have forgotten it. She has not lost any hair yet but her elbows have always been calloused. She has history of elevated liver enzymes, hypothoyroidism, and hypertension. Behaviorally she has always been thunderstorm-phobic. She has always been easily excitable. This has caused some pack-management issues but I don't want to get into that now. But it was those behavioral issues that prompted her first ACTH challenge 2 years ago. She had urinalysis with her recent tests and the specific gravity revealed she was not concentrating her urine. She has also had ACTH challenge and LDDS. I don't have any of these specific values but I know my vet would be happy to give them to me. We have not done an abdominal ultrasound yet.Again, thank you so much for your help.",

The doc told me the ACTH has such a high false negative rate that it could not reliably predict Cushing's. That is why we did LDDS which definitely showed pituitary Cushing's. The vet is great--she has been in practice about 30 years and when her daughter went off to college at Texas A & M she went with her and did some additional study in internal medicine and surgery. She is great to sit down and explain things and is always available for questions. She is my third vet and I feel fortunate to have been referred to her.She couldn't say how soon we would see improvements in Jesse. I feel very comfortable with the instructions she gave me for the Vetoryl loading and I am just thrilled you also have confidence in hter.",

Boots was tested and put on insulin shots 2x a day and then in a week on Vetoryl, 30 mg.\u00a0\u00a0The Vetoryl has made a world of difference in him.\u00a0\u00a0He acts like a younger dog.\u00a0\u00a0You'd never know he was so ill when he was diagnosed with diabetes and cushings.\u00a0\u00a0Vetoryl has not given him any side effects and it's been a miracle drug for him.This week my 10 year old pomeranian, Sassy, was diagnosed with cushings.\u00a0\u00a0She has an extremely complicated medical history with COPD, grade 4 heart murmur, thyroid and liver issues, as well as a pinched nerve in her neck rendering her unable to completely control her front legs in trying to walk.\u00a0\u00a0She does limp slowly around and is not in leg or nerve pain.\u00a0\u00a0 She takes 4-5 pills 2 times a day for her liver, heart, a water pill, throid, etc and she took Vetoryl, 30 mg, tonight for the first time.\u00a0\u00a0I expect to see marked improvement in her within two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Vetoryl is not cheap; I pay $1.85 per pill - but my dogs have been faithful loving companions and I will do whatever I need to for their health as long as they have good quality of life.I highly recommend you try Vetoryl for your dogs cushings.\u00a0\u00a0There is at least one other pill out there - I have seen it for $7 per pill and you give it once a week.\u00a0\u00a0However Vetoryl is recommended by my vet and Boots has shown remarkable improvement on it and I am expecting the same results with Sassy within the next 2 weeks as the dosage loads into her body.",
