    "question": "ok dose this sound like diabetes or do i just have like every std in the book and them some other problems? ok so these are the symtoms of diabetes ive had more than a few times but not all on a regular basis. frequent urination- granted i drink a lot but i go 1-4x per hr, i drink stuff all the time just cuz i like to its more like my brain craves fluid not cuz my throaght is dry, unusual weight loss i can lose weight with out dieting as long as im not constantly pigging out but in a two week perion i was eating all kinds of high calorie fatty foods and i still lost 6lbs, i have been growing increasingly more irritable over the past year, especially 3 months, im not ever really fatuiged like i dont feel like ive just exercizd a bunch but ive grown increasingly lazy and have no motivation to do even the simplest things, i take longer to heal for cuts and bruises than most peolple, im not sure this is a diabetes symptom but my blood takes forever to clot, my hands and feet will go numb and tingle and sometimes this unpleasant feeling will go into my fore arms and calves,and ive had this skin problem like on my hands and feet like a blister type thing will appear for no good reason but it looks like a slightly deflated blister usually if theyre bigger and i got smaller ones too usually on my feet, and on the arches of my feet in the past ive gotten this raw red rash and the skin peels off and its itchy and when i was little it was more common for me to have a bladder infection than not to have one...well im not so sure they were bladder infections but my mom said they were she never took me to the doctor for them now i think its like gohnnarea or something but all my tests have come back negative",
