            "answer": "Say \"hello!\" to a fellow weight-gainer!\u00a0\u00a0No fun.\u00a0\u00a0Not much you can do about it.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot lose weight to save my life, but exercising 3-4 days a week for a minimum of 30 minutes keeps the needle from going up.\u00a0\u00a0It is extremely frustrating.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors tell me I can lose weight, I'm just not using the right combination of food and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Okay, well, I had a thyroidectomy in the year 2000 and the first couple months following the surgery I was so excited because I actually dropped 30-something pounds and I thought to myself, \"here was my answer. I just needed my thyroid out because it wasn't functioning properly.\"\u00a0\u00a0Yeah, well, no.\u00a0\u00a0I am sorry to say that especially now that you know your thyroid is out-of-whack, you cannot take any weight loss medications or shakes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0It will only make you gain.\u00a0\u00a0The best results I had with weight loss were when I had a pre-diabetes scare about two years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a class and learned about carbs, sugar, and all that.\u00a0\u00a0I ended up lowering my carb intake drastically and sugar became almost non-exhistant.\u00a0\u00a0I lost 50 pounds, but only after combining the above with activity.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I cannot get the needle to drop anymore; like I said above, no matter how much additionaly activity I exert, I cannot lose anymore weight.\u00a0\u00a0I still would like to lose 30-35 pounds, but I cannot imagine what else is left to do to get the guage moving again.So, I definately relate and unfortunately, I don't have good news.\u00a0\u00a0I also have to continually have my TSH checked because it does fluctuate, and I have become so intune with my body that I definately know when it is off.\u00a0\u00a0What throws it off, I don't know for sure.\u00a0\u00a0Fatigue is my biggest indicator.\u00a0\u00a0Also, be mindful of depressive thoughts.\u00a0\u00a0For me, the thyroid issue, weight gain and depression went hand-in-hand.Good luck to you!\u00a0\u00a0Take care of yourself and keep active.",

            "answer": "Nomatter what some doctors say, Armour thyroid has been much more effective than sythroid. I tried synthroid and switched doctors. SI have read that Synthroid contributes a lot of money to med schools so doctors aren't made aware of Armour. It mimics your natural thyroid better. the weight got better and the body ahes went away in days!!!!",

            "answer": "Sorry about all the typos and fast message- I have had much better results with Armour. With Hashimoto's keep your TSH towards 1 and you'll feel almost normal!",
