            "answer": "I used to raise bees.....10 large hives, so I know the pollen has benefits..my question becomes before we recommend barks, herbs etc. to folks shouldn't we know what the absorbable iron content is???I mean, wouldn't we all love for chocolate and cinnamon etc to make us well...but with liver disease each of these items may have draw backs in terms of it's nutritional values and it's overall chemical effects on liver synthesis and deep vein thrombosis etc.from your link only benefit is indicated...: however no mention of liver benefit is, nor is any of the complex chemistry discusses whereby this bark effects blood flow and the other claims.If cinnamon also does effects clotting, then it may be contraindicated in liver disease for that reason alone as the greater the fibrosis the more chances of blockages/clots within that organ etc.....ergo what works for women in menses and other womb ailments because it causes less blood flow and more clotting does not translate into a beneficial effect upon the liver. Now if you could show us a study where cinnamon was shown to shrink varicies or something....then perhaps we'd have something.I'd also wonder if, like casscara bark, cinnamon being in powdered form were a good source of iron as well,\u00a0\u00a0that we may want to watch our intake not add to it.not saying I'm right here, haven't researched it....but just food for thought.maryB",

            "answer": "6/14 Cinnamon capsules to reduce blood sugar are medicinal products!Efficacy has not been scientifically proven - Some products contain high levels of coumarinPress release 14/2006 - Joint press release by BfArM and BfRFood supplements and dietetic foods with high levels of cinnamon or cinnamon extract have been on sale for some time now in Germany. Amongst other things, they are said to reduce the blood sugar level in type II Diabetes mellitus. Both the Federal Institute for Medicinal Products and Medical Devices (BfArM) and the Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) are of the opinion that products marketed with a claim of this nature should be classified as medicinal products and required to seek marketing authorisation. During the marketing authorisation procedure the efficacy, safety and pharmaceutical quality of a medicinal product are examined. Food supplements and dietetic foods, by contrast, are not required to obtain marketing authorisation. Hence, there is no examination of their quality, efficacy or safety nor is any scientific risk-benefit analysis undertaken. Cinnamon-containing dietetic foods to reduce blood sugar have now been classified by the courts as medicinal products. They cannot, therefore, be marketed as foods. Both these products and cinnamon-containing \u201cfood supplements\u201d, which are sold without any health claims, vary considerably when it comes to their coumarin contents. The results of official food control reveal that some products contain so much coumarin that the recommended daily dose already exceeds the tolerable daily intake (TDI). BfR believes that products of this kind are harmful.Food supplements are foods. They are intended to supplement a diet with doses of substances with a specific nutritional or physiological effect. In the case of cinnamon products bearing the claim \u201cthat they reduce blood sugar\u201d, by contrast, it is suggested that cinnamon and its ingredients have a therapeutic effect, i.e. are intended \u201cto heal, alleviate, prevent or identify diseases, suffering, physical damage or pathological disorders\u201d (\u00a72 Drugs Act). Health-related statements and claims of this nature are not admissible for foods or dietetic foods but are restricted to medicinal products.Furthermore, there is no scientific evidence that cinnamon or cinnamon products can have a positive effect on the blood sugar level of diabetics. Up to now, no other studies have unequivocally confirmed the results of a study from Pakistan. Cinnamon has not been granted marketing authorisation as a plant medicinal product for the treatment of diabetes in Germany or Europe. Hence, there has been no examination of the quality, efficacy and safety of cinnamon in conjunction with blood sugar reduction. Nor has there been any monitoring of possible side-effects.BfArM and BfR believe that the regular taking of large amounts of cinnamon in the gram range, something that is recommended to diabetics by the general press and seemingly even by some doctors, is harmful. Potential active principles have not been standardised. It is not known whether the long-term taking of products of this kind will lead to adverse reactions.Furthermore, the ingredient, coumarin, contained in cinnamon can cause damage to and inflammation of the liver when higher doses are taken over a longer period by sensitive individuals. The cassia cinnamon used in food supplements and dietetic foods - particularly cinnamon powder products - sometimes contains high levels of coumarin,. This was shown by tests of the monitoring authorities of the federal states. Some of the cinnamon products examined contained so much coumarin that the recommended daily dose would already exceed the tolerable daily intake (TDI) of 0.1 milligram coumarin per kilogram body weight (the TDI values indicates the amount of a substance that can be ingested daily over a lifetime without any adverse health effects). As the consumer also ingests coumarin from other sources like cinnamon-containing foods and cosmetics, damage to health cannot be ruled out from the long-term taking of products with a high cassia cinnamon content.\u201cDiabetics who ingest large amounts of cinnamon powder or cinnamon products daily on the advice of a few doctors of as part of a diet plan should not take these products because of the possibly high coumarin contents and the inadequately proven efficacy\u201d, says the Director of BfArM, Professor Dr. Reinhard Kurth. The German Diabetes Society (DDG) also advises against taking cinnamon products. \u201cConsumers who ingest large amounts of cassia cinnamon powder or cassia cinnamon products for other reasons, for instance to improve digestion, should not take these products either\u201d, advises the President of BfR, Professor Dr. Dr. Andreas Hensel.Year of issue: 2006date of issue: 15.11.2006",
