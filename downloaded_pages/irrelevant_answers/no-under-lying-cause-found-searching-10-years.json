            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Scattered foci of increased T2/Flair signals indicate small vessel ischemic disease or changes of brain blood vessels. These changes are seen in multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer's or Wilson's Disease, migraine headaches, diabetes, high blood pressure and high cholesterol.Further tests will need to be done to rule out MS as you do not have lesions typical of MS. Lupus can be ruled out through appropriate tests. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
