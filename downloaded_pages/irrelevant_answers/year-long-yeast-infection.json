    "question": "For the past year I've had a yeast infection every month. My doctor has giving me Diflucan and it clears it up a bit but it always comes back. It has ruined my sex life. There is white chunky discharge, uncontrollable itchiness, and it feels irritated down there and it is very red. I don't know what to do. I was on birth control but stopped taking it hoping it would help but nope! I don't know what to do anymore. I've never had a yeast infection until it appeared a year ago after a regular check up at my obgyn to change my birth control at the time. I am desperate!! I just want to go back to how things were a year ago, everything was normal down there!",
