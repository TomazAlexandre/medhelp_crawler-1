            "answer": "Is Zydol, Tramadol? That sounds familiar.I am glad you found this site! There are many on here who have experience with Tramadol. I know the w/d's can be dangerous, so please talk to a doctor as you prepare to detox.As far as the shame of admitting addiction. you are not alone, please remember this. If you had diabetes, would you be ashamed to admit that? I know it is different, but the point is that you are addicted to the pills. It is a real disease. Again, you are not alone! You will be surprised at home much support you will actually get when you confide in people.Stay strong! You can do this! Keep posting, someone with experience with Tramadol will be on soon I am sure",
