            "answer": "he shouldnt scare you like that...... like I said if he didnt do a vaginal u/s its extremely difficult to see anything at 5 weeks also they use your last menstral period to date a pregnancy you may have ovulated abit later in your cycle as well, it also depends on the skill of the person doing the u/s and the age of the machine makes a difference, if your doctor just did it in his room, and not send you to a specialist place that would also be another reason for not seeing anything, if the same thing happens again the next visit, DO NOT take any medicine he may want you to take to bring on a miscarriage, ask to be referred to a place that specialises in pregnancy u/s for another scan, unless your having symptoms of a tubal pregnancy you shouldnt worry too much about that, the symptoms for that dont usually show up until around 5-7wks and again the use of a transvaginal u/s combined with irregular rises in hcg and sometimes abdominal pain to the side will help diagnose a tubal/eptopic pregnancy",

            "answer": "oh they usually get you back in 1-2 weeks so your going back earlier than 1 wk so things maynot have changed that much, I would ask for a referal as I said and if he wont give you one, can you go to another doctor for a second opinion",

        {
            "answer": "ok well if they confirm its eptopic then of course you should take the piil as they can be extremley dangerous, so\u00a0\u00a0the options are checking your hcg levels to see if they're rising as they should and if eptopic is ruled out again I can only stress to you at this stage dont be too worried if they can onnly see a sack at your next scan, Ive had plenty and at 5wks you wont see mcuh else, maybe a yolk sac inside, I still think its a wee bit early for your next scan but hopefully something will be visable by then, also you can experience cramping when your just pregnant, it sometimes feels like a pulling tugging sensation or like premenstral cramps, you will have to be monitored a bit closer having diabetes but alot of women have this condition and go on to have successful pregnancies :) dont worry about asking question I'll try to help if I can :)",

            "answer": "I think they will have more of an idea with the combination of blood test and scan, but with all the scans that I have been to they have always made me come back 2 wks later so they can have a clearer\u00a0\u00a0picture of what maybe going on, I can understand him wanting to get on top of it if it is eptopic to avoid the risk of your tube rupturing and you needing surgery, but I just think 9 times out of 10 its just too early to see anything",
