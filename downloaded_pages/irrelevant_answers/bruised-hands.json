            "answer": "If u did blood work i am assuming u don't have anemia or low iron count. As we age our skin thin out and bruises can look worse but a simple task of pressing a trigger spray should not cause bruising. Are u on any meds for blood thinners? Or if your diet have a lot of salicylates it blocks vit K and cause the blood to \"thin\". Also Vit E is a antagonist to Vit K causing some folks to have bad bruising if too much is in their diets. B6 Supplement can also have the same effect. Also some folks if taking omega 3 supplement and eating a lot of rich foods with omega 3 have reported to bruised. Also garlic and onions and spices are natural antibiotics that kill the good bacteria in out intestine that produce vit K. So look into your diet to see if u are naturally thinning your blood by using or depleting your Vit K supply.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Localized bruising could be due to fragile spider veins in the hands due to prolonged use of OCPs or depot contraceptive shots, hormonal imbalance due to menopause, diabetes, hypothyroidism or clots in veins. A duplex ultrasound or color dopplar should be done along with tests to rule out these conditions. Possibility of blood vessel compression at wrist should also be looked at. Please consult a vascular specialist regarding this.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Can anyone help - I am a 48 year old woman and have suffered for the past year or so with swelling fingers (especially in the cold) and if I pick up something with a hard edge - clap my hands or press a trigger spray for a little while my hands bruise and turn black under the skin, especially the fingers. I have seen my GP but he is completely at a loss as to what it can be.\u00a0\u00a0He ran blood tests but nothing showed up. I am quite fit for my age and have a resting heart rate of 48.",
