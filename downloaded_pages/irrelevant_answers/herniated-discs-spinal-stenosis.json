            "answer": "sounds more like you have cervical disc issues that may result in a fusion of several discs. if so, it is a popular procedure with a high rate of success and very little pain if you follow the post surgical instructions.I had this surgery on C-4,5,6,7 last summer and was playing golf nine weeks later. I am 56 years old, male, and used to drive alot myself. good luck.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your info. After your multiple fusions, is your neck stiff? I see you golf. I am concerned I couldn't turn my head enough to drive if they do multiple fusions. My energy level is very poor, it takes all I can do to work, and then just sit or lay the rest of the time. Do you think they would do the cervical fusions, and the herniated disc repair in my lower back at the same time? Any advice greatly appreciated.",
