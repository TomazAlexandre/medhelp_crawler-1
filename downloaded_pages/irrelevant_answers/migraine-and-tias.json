            "answer": "Hi,How are you? According to the American Heart Association,\u00a0\u00a0TIA is a \"warning stroke\" or \"mini-stroke\" that produces stroke-like symptoms but no lasting damage. This occurs when a blood clot temporarily clogs an artery. The symptoms occur rapidly and last a short time. The good thing is recovery is complete. It may recur\u00a0\u00a0and the risk for future stroke depends on the cause of TIA and management of risk factors.It is important that you control these risk factors such as high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, and other associated disorders. Smoking should also be stopped. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "Hi,It is good that you will be starting your migraine treatment program soon. The chances of recurrence is not high especially if the risk factors mentioned are controlled. Try to inform your boss also about this for him/her to understand the conditions and the steps you are doing to prevent this so that you can concentrate on your work.\u00a0\u00a0It is also possible that your migraine headaches are triggered by hormonal changes you may be experiencing.

    "question": "This past weekend I had an episode at work.\u00a0\u00a0I had just finished dinner and was coming back from the the ladies room whenn I began to feel very dizzy. When I got back to my workspace I told my coworker I need to go to the back to sit down and catch my breath. Th next thing I remember is waking up on the floor of the room with my whole left side numb and my chest hurting. EMS was called and when we got to the hospital they ruled out a heart attack. But the numberness on the left side and dizzy remained for 48 hours. And while I didn't have a migriane to start with A rush of pain came soon after. They started me on a whole bevy of medication.\u00a0\u00a0And let me go a few day later with a note to stay home in bed for 3 more days.\u00a0\u00a0They say the thought I had suffered from I TIA. To me thinking isn't really good enough, I need to know if these\u00a0\u00a0things recur and if so how many times and how frequently. I've already had migraines for 25 years and thy're too complicated for the doctors to figure out. This isn't something else I need on top of it as well. But I need to be able to tell my boss this won't happen again. I'm frightened that this will occr more than once and I'll do anything to keep them from coming on again.\u00a0\u00a0Can you help me?",
