    "question": "Lately I can go from being comfortable to being hot to being cold with no outward influences. The changes can happen in a matter of seconds. I am also having itching, vaginal dryness, hair loss, muscle aches and pains. I had a partial hysterectomy 15 years ago but they didn't take my ovaries. I am now 57. From what I've read this sounds like menopause, but is their anything to keep the symptoms down. They are horrible. How do women deal with this. I can be sitting in my chair and go from cold to hot (sweating) in seconds.",
