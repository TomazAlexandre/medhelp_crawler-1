Their lives sound much like you and your husband: they are functional and healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I have traveled with them and\u00a0\u00a0attest they can live without alcohol - though at times, they would rather not.I have colleagues and clients who drink from moderate to heavily at social functions and sometimes even drink earlier in the day than, well, I would ever admit to.My father was an alcoholic. In fact, there is a big time history of alcoholism on his side of the family. Yet, I have five sisters and I am the only alcoholic.

My other two sisters do not drink .While you did not mention other drugs, I do not use it but I have no issues with marijuana. I have friends in their 50's and 60's who routinely use it.
