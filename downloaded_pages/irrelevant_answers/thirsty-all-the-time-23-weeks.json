            "answer": "I think you should definitely mention it to your Dr. next time you see her/him. Normally, you would not be scheduled for the glucose test until 24-28 weeks, but if you are under 25, you may not be asked to do that at all. (unless, they detect something in your urine) That is why I would mention it. I am very trusty myself (27weeks) but I have already taken my glucose test and am now waiting for the 3 hour test results. It is nothing to panic about, but let your dr. know.",

My dr. did a reg. fasting blood sugar test just to be on the safe side and thankfully it was not elevated. I'm taking a blood pressure pill 4 times a day and we think it is making me thristy. I would mention it to your dr. it is nice to have peace of mind and make sure it isn't a glucose problem!",

            "answer": "If you pass the 1 hour glucose test, there is nothing else to do. If it turns out over 140, you will be scheduled for the 3 hour test and if you fail that one then you will be put on diet to monitor that your baby does not get huge since all of your sugar intake is now going to her/him. There is a bit more to it, but unless you know, no need to worry about it.",

I have only had sugar in my urine once so the only way to know for sure if you have the diabetes is the 2 or 3 hour test I did 2 hour test in my country NZ you drink 75g of sugary drink get tested before and then 2 hours later but allowed no food from 8pm the night before water was fine. Oh you only do the longer one if the 1 hour one failed.\u00a0\u00a0But you may just be thirsty with hot climate and being pregnant good luck.",
