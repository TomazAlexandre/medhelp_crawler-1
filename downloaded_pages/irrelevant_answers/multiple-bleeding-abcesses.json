            "answer": "Hi Again,Thank you for responding. My levels run in the mid100's and I am on the maximum dosage od glipizide and metformin. I cannot afford the insulin they want to put me on. My main concern is this may be MRSA. I have had klebsiella pnuemonae(sp?) and am worried now I have this. Hopefully it is just my diabetes. What I am really worried about is why they won't fully drain and why it was bleeding for a whole day. If they do not go away in a few days I will have to see a Dr. somehow.",

            "answer": "Hello,Insulin doesn't need to be expensive if you use the old insulins.\u00a0\u00a0Humalin-N and R. These can work quite well.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is appropriate if you are already on maximum dose of oral meds.Apparently manuka honey is good for such wounds.\u00a0\u00a0Are you able to get some sun?\u00a0\u00a0Expose them to sunlight, may help (but not too long to get sunburnt).I strongly recommend the book \"Diabetes Solutions\" by Dr. Richard Bernstein, which gives great tools to manage blood sugar including infomraiton about using insulin.\u00a0\u00a0He recommends a very low carb diet, along with appropriate use of medications and exerccise.Another good book is \"Using Insulin\" by John Walsh.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe these can be available from your local library.But do see the Dr. if you can and if they're not improving soon.It is so upsetting to see so many people now who can't afford healthcare because they don't have insurance.I live in Philppines and basically if one has no money one doesn't get to see a Dr or get treated...",

    "question": "Hi, I am typell diabetic and one of my worst problems is that I get multiple abcesses in my armpits,breasts, vaginal, and rear areas. Most are in my armpits and i have one in my left and 4 in my right right now.\u00a0\u00a0They largest I've had is about3\". What can I do to keep them from coming back? Also, none of them will heal and fully drain. It's been over 2 weeks and one started bleeding bright red blood for a day. It's back to a slow ooze but I am worried they are still there. I am also extremely exhausted. I have no insurance. Any ideas?",
