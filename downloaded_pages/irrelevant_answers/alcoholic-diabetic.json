            "answer": "I think you probably already know what type responses you will get, because you already know what is true. You need to get into recovery....like yesterday! To be blunt, as a Type 1 diabetic, if you continue on like this you aren't going to live very long. You know that, don't you? Perhaps you weren't ready yet when you went for treatment before. Many young people are in denial about how bad their addiction is, and not ready to quit partying. I hope you are ready now? The other thing about treatment is it isn't 30 days and then life as usual. You need to dramatically alter everything about your life including your friends, what you do in your spare time, how you handle emotions and stress, your thinking, etc. Whatever form of treatment you engage in you then need an ongoing support. I highly recommend AA as an excellent source of ongoing support where you are connected with others who understand (they have special young people's meetings), and to someone you are responsible to which is your sponsor. This in addition to whatever intensive treatment you undergo, and then \"working your program of recovery\" every day from then on is the only way to maintain sobriety. Don't be discouraged because you weren't able to get it previously, it sometimes takes a couple \"tries\". But please, please do get yourself into recovery because for you as a Type 1 diabetic there is no other option.",

    "question": "I am 21 yrs old and have been drinking since I was 16 which is also the age I was diagnosed with type1 diabetes. I have been to impatient and outpatient treatement for my alcoholism but I still can't seem to stop drinking. I know this takes a big toll on my diabetes and was wondering if anyone out there has been struggling with the same problem and what might help me quit?\u00a0\u00a0I know its up to me and I have to do this on my own I was just wondering if anyone is going through the same thing? Even on days that I haven't drank, i feel nauseous, get light headed easy and feel like im going to pass out, have spells where I get really hot, and I've been throwing up a lot, almost everyday . Amazingly I do eat, and take my insulin, and manage to keep a blood sugar within the 100's most of the time. The only time it is really high is if I've been drinking a lot. I'm not pregnant and am wondering if the reason I've been getting sick all the time is because of the alcohol or if it could be something else? Thank you for any input you might have",
