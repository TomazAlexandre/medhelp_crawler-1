            "answer": "Hello,I would like to rule out the possibility of lichen planus from these symptoms and photographs. It present as shiny, firm and reddish purple bumps on the skin. They can appear on different parts of the body. The most common places for these bumps to appear are the wrists, lower back, and ankles, but they can appear anywhere on the skin.These bumps can itch also. To confirm the diagnosis a biopsy needs to be done. Please consult a dermatologist for this.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
