I ALWAYS gain a lot of weight fast while pregnant, but lose it just as fast. I used to weigh 30 lbs less, before kids, but I quit smoking and injured my back, so I ate and ate and ate.I don't see a big deal about being overweight while you're pg. As long as you eat healthy, and you can even give into your cravings to an extent, you'll be fine. I thought for sure I'd fail the GD test, but turns out my sugar has been on the low-normal side. I have to eat a snack or drink juice every 2 hours to keep it level and up.Don't let a dr tell you b/c you're overweight that you should only gain 15-25 lbs. That's BS!! They don't see how fast we lose the weight afterwards.Plus, when you're overweight, at least from my own personal experience, you're blessed with much bigger boobs than most. They grow a hell of a lot faster in pg than anything else. Before this pg, I was 36C, now I'm 38DD and it's small. So, attribute some of the weight gain to that area.",
