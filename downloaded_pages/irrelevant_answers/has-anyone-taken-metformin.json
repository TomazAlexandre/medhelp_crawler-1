My RE released me cause he doesn't do pregnancy and i so don't like the GYN that i have now. She said that metformin is not doing anything to me and they don't give it during pregnancy.

    "question": "Hi girls. I just wanted to know if there is any out there who has taken metformin and for how long and how much? Did everything turn out OK? My RE put on metformin for this cycle, i'm almost 8 weeks pregnant but now that i'm going to a regular GYN she is gonna make it stop.My RE is out for the month and i'm not sure if i'm gonna take it for the first trimester or the whole pregnancy. I'm going to ask him when he comes back and i so don't like the gyn that is following me now. But i don't have insurance to go to a private doctor and i already paid a lot of money to my RE for my cycles. Any information i would appriciated",
