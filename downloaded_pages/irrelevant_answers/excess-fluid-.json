            "answer": "Google:What could be causing this problem?Experts don't know what causes many cases of polyhydramnios, particularly mild ones. Some common causes of moderate to severe cases include:Maternal diabetes You can end up with high fluid levels if you have diabetes and you're having trouble managing it properly. Polyhydramnios is diagnosed in about 10 percent of pregnant diabetics, usually in the third trimester.Carrying twins or multiples You're at risk for high fluid levels if you're carrying twins or multiples. Polyhydramnios is especially likely in the case of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome, in which one twin has too little amniotic fluid while the other has too much.Genetic abnormalities Babies with very high fluid levels are more likely to have a genetic abnormality such as Down syndrome.Fetal abnormalities In rare cases, a baby will have a medical problem or birth defect that causes him to stop swallowing fluid while his kidneys continue to produce more urine from the fluid he's already swallowed. This may include any condition that makes it hard for him to swallow, such as pyloric stenosis, a cleft lip or palate, or some kind of blockage in the gastrointestinal tract. Certain neurological problems, such as with a neural tube defect or hydrocephaly, can keep the baby from swallowing as well.Fetal anemia In even rarer cases, polyhydramnios can be a sign that the baby has severe anemia caused by an Rh blood incompatibility or an infection such as fifth disease. In both cases, the problem can be treated with a blood transfusion in utero. A baby with fifth disease may recover without treatment. What will happen if I'm diagnosed with polyhydramnios?If you're diagnosed with polyhydramnios, your practitioner will order a high-resolution ultrasound to check for abnormalities and possibly amniocentesis to test for a genetic defect.You'll also need to have regular nonstress tests or ultrasounds for the rest of your pregnancy to monitor your baby's development. And you'll be watched closely for signs of preterm labor. If you haven't yet been tested for gestational diabetes, you'll be tested now.You'll be monitored carefully during labor as well. Because of the extra amniotic fluid, there's a greater risk of an umbilical cord prolapse (when the cord falls through the cervical opening) or a placental abruption when your water breaks. Both require an immediate c-section.That's why your caregiver will have you come to the hospital early in labor \u2013 or right away if your water breaks before you go into labor. Postpartum bleeding is more likely as well, because your overly distended uterus may not be able to contract well, so you'll be watched closely after you give birth, too.",

            "answer": "Thank you but none of that makes sense because its been normal up until now. I don't have gestational diabetes and they haven't noticed any abnormalities in the baby. This is just weird.",

            "answer": "It could be nothing honestly. They told me at my docs office that my fluid was low, sent me for an ultrasound a week later at the hospital and the fluid was fine. But i found that on google so you would know what could be wrong if anything.You gotta keep in mind too that the baby is swallowing and then peeing out that fluid. So if they just caught it after it peed it out but hadn't swallowed much yet that could make a difference too if it was super excessive.",
