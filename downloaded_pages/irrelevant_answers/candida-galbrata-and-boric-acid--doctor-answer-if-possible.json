            "answer": "Hi!Of the two candida species. albicans is usually the cause of thrush and glabrata is usually due to some immune-compromised state. Candida glabrata colonies are usually white in color, smooth and glistening. Candida albicans colonoies are white to cream in color, soft, and smooth to wrinkled. In your case low lactobacillus in the vagina could be the cause of this infection (as of now the lactobacillus quantity must be on low side). When lactobacillus is absent, then also you can have a discharge. So replacing this bacteria by vaginal tablets and\u00a0\u00a0oral lactobacillus preparation is necessary.Various reasons for recurrent fungal infection or Candida glabrata infection are incomplete treatment, treatment resistance, or co-existing dermatitis, diabetes, STD\u00a0\u00a0and low immunity. The risk of vaginal infections especially thrush or fungal infection is higher in women on contraceptive pills containing estrogen. Changing the pill type often helps in these cases. Discuss this with your gynecologist. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you.

            "answer": "Hi thanks for your reply. I have been tested for all stds, diabetes, hepatitis, HIV,allergies, bacteria etc.all come back repetedly negative except for glabrata. So I guess I do not feel immunocompromised. I realise there has been very little study into this type of yeast, but does anybody have any idea why it overgrows in an otherwise healthy person? Im about at by wits end with the discomfort and if I don't have huge amount of discharge, I have creams or boric acid coming out of me which is just as bad. 5 days left on boric acid...hopefully it will cute it! Any help would be greatly appreciated.",

    "question": "Helloi have posted about this question quite a few times, for the past 6 months i have had problems with a huge amount of vaginal discharge with no pathogen found untiln recently being diagnosed with candida galbrata. THe discharge was thick and white like hair conditioner, smooth, no odor, and extremely profuse. Ive spent well over $1000 seeing doctorrs and specialists and just recently the found candida galbrata on a swab, both internally and externally on the genitalia. Ive been repeatedly tested negative for all stds.My questions are first, is it possible that for whatever reason the first couple of times that this has been the problem all the time and it just did not show up on the swab? i also had a sexual health nurse look at it under microscope and said she could see no \"yeast\" but that there was no lactobacilli but also no bacteria. Whe i went back there were some lactobacilli there.Im on day 6 of 14 of boric acid treatment, it seems to come out in big gushes usually once in the morning and once at night, i presume this is just the suppository leaving my body? The discharge itself has changed, and is now like jelly egg white, although there does still seem to be too much of it and i am still having itching around my vaginal opening and clitoris.So my questions are, is it possible it has been candida galbrata all along? how does it differ from albicans in terms of showing up under microscopes or swabs? if the boric acid does not clear this, what are some suitable oral medications to take? ( alreay tried ketoconazole with no clearing), and what exactly causes candida galbrata to grow in the vagina and is it usually there in the first place?Any help would be appreciated, I am hoping this has been the problem all along and i will not have to consider the cervical cauterisation they doctors were suggesting when they could not find any pathogen.Thanks so much",
