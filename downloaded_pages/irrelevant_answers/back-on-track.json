            "answer": "Hi!If craving for sweets is something which started recently, then please consult a gynecologist to rule out hormonal imbalance due to polycystic ovary or pre menopause. Diabetes, insulin related problems and adrenal fatigue (problems related to adrenal gland) should also be ruled out. It can also be part of an eating disorder. Please get this investigated.Meanwhile you can opt for \u2018diet sweet\u2019 which are sugar free options with artificial sweeteners. If all medical conditions are ruled out, then stop buying sweets. Keep healthy food options at hand. Visit restaurants with family and friends and opt for healthy food items. Reduce the portion size of desserts. Hope this helps! Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
