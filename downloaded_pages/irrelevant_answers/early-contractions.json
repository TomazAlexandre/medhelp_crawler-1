It sounds to me that she might go into labor early, but I'm not sure. I know some women feel braxton hicks throughout their pregnancy. I'm really unsure of what could be happening to her, but I'm sure someone on here may be more knowledgeable about it than I am.",

I was having contractions every 5 minutes but was not dilating. they gave me two injections to stop the contractions and after a period of 4 hours they stopped. I was not dehydrated and was ruled out not having a bladder infection. I am now on bed rest for a week to see if the contractions stopped. they said I had an irritable uterus.

But I notice that every time I go for a walk a get contractions. I told my dr. he said to stop taking long walks, stop having sex and if I had sex to use a condom since semen makes your vagina contract I believe thats what he said. And also to drink a lot of water.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. said theres not really a reason to know why that happens. And like paxmommy said they defined as irretable uterus.",
