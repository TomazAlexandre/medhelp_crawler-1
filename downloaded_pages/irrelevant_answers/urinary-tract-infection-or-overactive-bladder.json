    "question": "I had a urinary tract infection in January and was prescribed an antibiotic to take 1 week. When I went back after 10 days to be rechecked, it was improved but not completely gone. I was told to come back in a month to be rechecked and was told it was positive for a UTI. I then had a culture which came back showing no bacteria growth. I had a bout of diarrhea for 10 days in February after which I had a cramping pain in my ride side below my ribs, which I still have. I have also been gassy, bloated in my pelvic area and crampy. My doctor thought it was something intestinal and had me go for a ct scan. Nothing really showed on the CT scan except a possible cyst on my ovary and that my uterus dropped. I went to my gyn yesterday, did a vaginal ultrasound didn't find the cyst but noticed my bladder was full, I did not have an urge to go. He also wasn't too concerned with the uterus. I have had a problem with frequently going to the bathroom at night, probably about 4-5 or more times. During the day is not a problem. He is convinced it is overactive bladder and gave me medication to take daily. I also have to go for another pelvic ultrasound to compare to the ct scan and another vaginal ultrasound. Do you think that overactive bladder could be the problem, or that I am just not emptying my bladder all the way. Also if the urinalysis comes back as positive for a UTI then 2 days later when I went for the culture it came back ok?",
