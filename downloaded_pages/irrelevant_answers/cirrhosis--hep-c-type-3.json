            "answer": "Welcome. I too am a newbie to the site. My heart goes out to you and I wish I was more knowledgeable regarding your condition. The only thing I really know is that geno 3 is supposedly a fairly good HCV to have if one must have HCV as is 2b which is what I have.I am not treating and have had HCV since 1965 and am almost 67 years old. All I can advise you to do is do a lot of research on the internet. Hopefully, others on this site will have more information for you.Best wishes to you.",

Avoid aspirin and other drugs that will aggravate your low platelets.\u00a0\u00a0There are some meds that are moving towards approval for use in HCV TX to boost platelet production and make it a safer ride.Try to stop thinking of \" How long have I got\" and hang in until the first wave of the protease inhibitors are approved and reach the market.\u00a0\u00a0It's a rough treatment but many relapsers and, I believe, breakthrough cases have had positive responses.\u00a0\u00a0If I were you, I'd spend the next year and a half getting prepared for the marathon that is re-treatment.\u00a0\u00a0Watch for liver cancer, lose the weight and get the diabetes under control.\u00a0\u00a0 I wish you all possible luck and will be thinking of you.",

Hang in there and good luck \"HALT C studies have shown that maintenance therapy does not stop the progression of the disease or the symptoms that come with a decompensating liver. Also because of low platelets and white and red counts, many cirrhotics take a beating with their counts fallling to dangerous levels, even on half dose interferon. I know because I was one of them.Like othersw have said, many of us live with cirrhosis for a greatg many years. there is a lot of hope so just keep hanging in. Also, as a type 2 diabetic, I am on metformin as are many other diabetic patients with hepaititis C. Diabetes is actually more harmful to the liver than the metofrmin. Getting my diabetes under control with diet, exercise\u00a0\u00a0and 500mg metformin pt my liver enzymes in the normal range and improved all my labs. My alk phos went from 135 where it had been for a couple of years down to 79. Keep a good watch on the diabetes.",

Initially trying doing something about the weight and the diabetes and getting both under control. From what you say, you have had rapic progrerssion and the low platelets could be problematic later on if treatment is deferred too long.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you drop weight, you have a treatment history that will, with aggressive treatment, probably require significant amount of both Peg and riba.\u00a0\u00a0Based on weight, you seemed to have been underdosed for riba in the past.\u00a0\u00a0And although Peg is not weight-based your history of breakthrough may be a need to kick it up a notch there too.\u00a0\u00a0Don't wait, get a doc, make a plan and act like your life depended on it.",

            "answer": "Because of the way you seemed to progress faster then some is why I suggested to do a maint dose. This hopefully would help to take the strain off the liver & give it a break while waiting for the new drugs. Not saying it would cure or regress the damage already done, just \"borrow time\" until the new drugs.Of course there are no doctors here just opinions from people that have / had HCV. Everyone is different and what worked them might not work for you.You should see a Hepatologist for advice and ask for expert opinion.",

That means for my body mass index of 19 I was getting the almost the same amount as you!\u00a0\u00a0That cannot be right at all.\u00a0\u00a0 It can lead to hemolytic anemia which is extremely \"unpleasant\" but it's almost a good thing because you know you are getting enough riba.\u00a0\u00a0It's a blessing in disguise sort of.it is CRUCIAL especially in the first 12 weeks that you get enough meds to get you to UND and keep you there for good!I smoke too (yes we know we should quit but thanks right?). I was a geno 1A and also 1B and I had to treat for 72 weeks to get to SVR.\u00a0\u00a0But, that was over two years ago and now I am cured.You have to do every single thing you can to swing these odds over to your side.\u00a0\u00a0It's probably not going to be pretty but by making sure you are getting enough meds and trying to drop some weight and all the things I'm sure you already know you can make the difference that you need.Obviously the meds were working - that's a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure your doctor gives you frequent sensitive PCR tests starting as early as possible but not less than at week 4 to start so you can see exactly what/when/how/why etc. that you get to UND and then continue to do everything to stay there.\u00a0\u00a0Even if it means extending (i was not negative at week 12 and only had a very small count but it meant I had to extend to put my odds in my own favor).it's all not fun but it can work.\u00a0\u00a0Start with finding that best doctor you can find and if you cannot switch for some reason..........learn all the correct things yourself.\u00a0\u00a0My doc was no great wiz but I learned everything I could on here and finally after a while he listened to me (was not always easy). Now today he has changed the entire way he practices hepc treatment because HE read all the latest studies and information for himself.\u00a0\u00a0It is that way for a bunch of us in here. If we coudn't change well we had to do something and you can too.Good luck to you.\u00a0\u00a0ASK questions and LEARN all you can. Get copies of every test you get done so you can learn how to read them and what to ask.\u00a0\u00a0it can change your life.",

I cannot begin to tell you the negative impact this thing has had on my life and career and how much happiness it has robbed from me and the two people I have been prepared to know of my condition ( I am sure you all have had similar experiences). Even my parents are unaware as I choose to spare them the worry in their twilight years. As a matter of fact one of my biggest worries is that with the cirrohsis progressing I may not be able to shield them from the knowledge.Even in this anonymous setting I feel uncomfortable discussing my condition.

    "question": "Hi forum members. I'm new to the site & hope that some of you might help enlighten me as I'm feeling pretty much alone about now. I'm 47, caucasian male, weigh around 118 kg, smoke 20 a day and 188cm. I've just found out I've got cirrohsis & about 6 months ago earlier that I have diabetes type 2 which I have under dietary control & so far so good - I've read diabetes medications are a big no no for compromised livers. I've had hcv since around 1984 I guess, making it some 25 years. I found out about the hcv around 1999 & had first treatment of rbavirin and interferon in 2000 and at that time was told after biopsy that I was a stage 2. I was a breakthrough after 48 weeks. Life went on and in 2005 I managed to get onto a Pegasys treatment (full dose - I think 800mg peginterferon and 1200mg ribavirin) at the time I weighed around 138kg. I broke through again after 12weeks and my specialist thought it best I stop to avoid any build up of immunity to the interferon therapy in case I got another chance at treatment. I tolerated both treatments pretty well. Anyway, again life went on and late last year (2008) after finding out I had type 2 diabetes (I found out as I was feeling pretty poorly - typical symptoms) my doctor noticed a low platelet count around 120 & thought I better touch base with my specialist. I did & new biopsy was ordered (more fun!). Now biobsy says cirrohsis & specialist (registrar) says lose weight (ie at least 20kg) in next three months & maybe you'll get a third treatment of peginterferon. All good & well, I think I can do the weight thing - believe me I'm motivated. What i can't work out at this stage is (and given my luck, I probably won't get the third chance & if I do I suspect I'll just breakthrough again anyway) is how much time do I have left? The registrar kind of dodged the question but said worst case scenario might be we are talking about a liver transplant in 5 years time! Does this sound about right? I've progressed from stage 2 to cirrohsis in 9 years. Is that as good as it gets or is the specialist being pessimistic? Anyway, all and any thoughts/ advice would be greatly appreciated.",
