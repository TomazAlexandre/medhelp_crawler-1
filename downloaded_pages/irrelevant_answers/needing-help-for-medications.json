            "answer": "Well I sure hoope it's a real lousy job that can drive you into bankruptcy.. Uur Son's Medical needs have just begun.. Throw in a Insulin PUmp ( $6,000) and other $10,000 yr for just Maintenance Care , btwn Dr.'s, Lab fees, Med supplies such as 250 test strips a month to Insulins, Eye exams, etc..And you and your husband can get insurance, but not your son.. T1's are UnInsureable..in most states and in ones that offer it, the premiums run $7-$12k yr..It's possible to just get Kids Care coverage thru your State.. Our State offers such a program.. Go to yur States Health Ins. Site and find out..And if he makes enough? He won't get much of any kind of public aid/ programs for the uninsured.. To be on the safe side? I'd be adding at least $10,000/yr to his budget for your sons care and hope he doesn't need any Hospital stays that ave $2,000 for Even a ER visit , let alone Staying in the Hospital..Plan B. you get a Part time job that you can get Into their Group Health plan, many co.'s offer it..Citi Bank, Starbucks, Walmart, etc..Hope this helps, good luckGood Luck..",

    "question": "Hello, we found out 2 years ago my son had Type 1 diabetes. We have been able to handle it pretty well, since we had medical insurance. My husband has now decided to leave and we will no longer have medical insurance. I do not know how I can afford to get all of his supplies. Are there any suggestions as to what I can do?Thanks you",
