    "question": "My 5yld boy complains all the time saying that his ears are hot, we took him several times to the doctor thinking that it was ear infection, but his ears are fine, he licks his hands and has to pass it to his ears and then his eyes, I ask him why and he would say \"my ears are hot, I have to lick it\" . Not only that but also when he goes potty has to take all his clothes off, why?? have no clue. We already start having troubles in school because of that , also becuase he licked another kid face. Also when we put shoes at him he would say.. \"my feet can't tickle\" I don't understand becuase we buy extra half size just in case, but after he wears the shoe he says.. my feet are hot and he gets desperate ...even in a cold day he complains about been to hot.",
