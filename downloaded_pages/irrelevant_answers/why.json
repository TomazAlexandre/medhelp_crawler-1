Anyway, went to the doctor, did the urine thing - nurse was alarmed by the over 200 reading and a week later did the glucose tolerance... over 200 reading. BUT, the percentage came out to normal sugar ratings for the past 3 months. The doctor said pregnancy could of screwed with my pancreas.",

            "answer": "If your A1c results returned normal did the doctor say you are type II diabetic?Rather odd in the manner the tests were performed. Usually the urine test is administered after a patient has been diagnosed with type II diabetes to check kidney function. What were your OGTT results - fasting & 2 hr?",

            "answer": "I have done only the fasting. I'll see a nutritionist soon, get a meter and monitor. OGTT results? Well, there's the 3 month average thing - 6.0 being normal levels and I was 5.9 - doctor was puzzled with that. Next time I see my doctor, I will be armed with questions - she says, \"you are diabetic...\" and I think that can't be. I'm assuming I have type 2.",

            "answer": "I don't feel you're diabetic either. The fasting glucose test measures glucose only at test time, not 2 hours prior, the day before or the week before. Did you sit and rest after getting to the doctor's office or did they call you immediately in and perform the test? The latter can, at times, give false positive readings. False positive being higher than normal/inaccurate.New red blood cells live an average of 3 months. With type II diabetics, glucose does not get absorbed into red cells to be burnt off, instead attaches to the outer wall. The A1c will catch this and show your glucose level for the past 3 months. The majority of doctors go by the A1c to determine whether a patient is diabetic or not.Pregnancy screwing with your pancreas? Possibly, but your A1c would have been over 6% if the pancreas was NOT producing insulin on demand. I would redo the tests or change doctors. You might try posting on the sister \"Ask A Doctor\" forum and see what Dr Ramsetty has to say about all of this.For meters, see yesterdays post by Cinney and WaveRider's response on accuracy of glucose meters. Very good information posted by Wave.",

I did the glucose tolerance last Friday morning and read till they called me in 15 min. after I arrived. - went in for the \"Y\" infection the Wednesday prior and was nervous. (I don't like getting my parts checked and was stressed and ate very little and that's when the high sugar was caught.)",

Fasting means no food (even if its just a little bit), no colored liquids like coffee, tea, or juices.",

    "question": "I have and always ate healthy and in moderation and have been exercising. I'm not overweight at all and am under 40. I have no family history, and I was just diagnosed with type 2. I did though have gestational but always ate healthy and exercised. I can't relate to anything on WebMd because I'm not the typical overweight, in active person. Is it the vitamins I've been taking for a couple of months? The baking soda and water? Stress? Can blood sugar just spike up out of nowhere and go back to normal? I don't get it. I've done what people do to prevent this and it doesn't work anyway. Is diabetes the disease du jour and\u00a0\u00a0another reason to buy a pill?",
