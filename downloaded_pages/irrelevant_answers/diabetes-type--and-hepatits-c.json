            "answer": "Hi, Flash.\u00a0\u00a0I have often wondered what Hep C treatment would be like combined with Type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Why?\u00a0\u00a0Because I am in Hep C treatment and my teenaged daughter, brother in law and sister in law all have Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0My first point is that if you were a patient of my own hepatologist, you would likely be encouraged to defer treatment.\u00a0\u00a0This is because your biopsy sounds very good, and your genotype is not 1.\u00a0\u00a0You probably have time to \"watch\" your Hep C until something better becomes available to cure it. Second, I have known people with Type 2 diabetes who have successfully completed treatment with no worse side effects.\u00a0\u00a0Third, and this is the most important point I would like to make, you should do a complete investigation on whether your autoimmune illness would prevent you from entering treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I have read many times that anyone with any autoimmune diseases, or autoimmune markers, can't do interferon because of the way it works with the immune system.\u00a0\u00a0Actually, I heard about this web site from a Type 1 diabetic friend!\u00a0\u00a0I really wish you luck.\u00a0\u00a0How long have you had Hep C?",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for the replies. I have had HepC at least 14 years-probably since the early 80s, transfusions most likely the reason. Of course, my lifestyle wasn't the best, so who knows.I've been Diabetic since age 5. I am now 47.I will see my Endocrinologist on Oct. 2. The GI doc didn't see a problem with tx, but I'll see what endo says. I sure wouldn't mind waiting for a milder treatment!!!!!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Flash",

            "answer": "I posted here about HbA1c being affected by tx. Ribavirin can cause the premature destruction of red blood cells and as a consequence give false low HbA1c. My understanding is that the HbA1c is determined by examining red blood cells to determine how much glucose is stuck to the cells. This is a crude description but I think it serves the purpose. Since a normal red blood cell lives for about 3 months, when the analysis is done it is based on the normal life of a red blood cell. If yours do not live that long because of the tx then the analysis will see little glucose stuck to the cell and extrapolate that the HbA1c is low compared to what would be seen in a normal RBC. I have hemolytic anemia from tx and so my RBCs live a significantly shorter life. So there is less time for the glucose to build up on the cell. Thus it appears that my average glucose is lower than it would appear if they were examining a normal RBC. I hope this make sense. If you are a diabetic the 4.5 HbA1c is almost certainly a false low. I think that with that HbA1c your daily glucose readings would be around 50. I doubt that's the case. As an aside I do think that some people's glucose is lowered by tx. This will not translate into an HbA1c as low as yours was I don't believe. I hope this makes sense to you. I figured this out a couple of years ago when my HbA1c was very low. At the time none of the doctors I spoke with had any idea about this but since I have read an article or two that cautions against reliance on HbA1c while on tx for the reason I have discussed.

            "answer": "I believe the reason we are apt to lose weight is because we have little or no appetite while on tx. Tx can cause hyperglycemia as the literature states. I wouldn't think that a non diabetic would develop diabetes but one with a slight glucose intolerance may. As to hypoglycemia I don't know about that. I have wondered if tx doesn't have a lowering effect on glucose so perhaps it could. Mike",

Is this why people lose weight on tx, or in my case, get lightheaded and dizzy sometimes (hypoglycemic?)?I've been assuming that the Peg and Riba increased metabolism somehow, burning up energy faster, but your explanation makes more sense.Can anyone tell us what the symptoms of type 2 diabetes are? Are we in more danger of becoming diabetic while on tx, or is that mostly for those already inclined toward getting it?Thanks to you all for this information.",

            "answer": "I believe the recommended HbA1c is 6.5. You're right about the 50 glucose. 4.5 would correlate with a glucose of 75. That's probably a good deal lower than your average glucose I would suspect. Mike",

            "answer": "\"Some of the symptoms of type 2 diabetes are the same as those for type 1 diabetes: frequent urination, excessive thirst and hunger, dramatic weight loss, irritability, weakness and fatigue, and nausea and vomiting. Some other symptoms of type 2 diabetes may include: recurring or hard-to-heal skin, gum, or bladder infections, blurred vision, tingling or numbness in hands or feet, and itchy skin. Unlike type 1 diabetes, symptoms for type 2 diabetes usually occur gradually over months or even years, and some people with type 2 diabetes have symptoms that are so mild they go unnoticed....\"Here are a few good Internet addresses, sorry I couldn't make them into direct links.\u00a0\u00a0If you just copy the address and then paste it into your browser.................http://www.diabetes.org/ - American Diabetes Associationhttp://www.aadenet.org/ - American Assoc. of Diabetes EducatorsI have read that treatment can cause a lot of illnesses, however my best thought about this is that if you are concerned about this issue and/or you have the symptoms mentioned above, talk to your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure they could add a glucose level to your upcoming bloodwork that would provide some insight.Best wishes,Helyn",

    "question": "I'm new to the Forum and will limit my posts as I see that is the norm. I am a type 1 Diabetic with Genotype 2 HepC. I have been biopsied 2 times. Once in 1990 and once in July 2003. No change in biopsy. Inflammation(mild) with no evidence of other damage. I am considering TX. Are there any Diabetics out there who have done Tx? Can you work through it? What happens to your sugars? Are the sides worse for those with two chronic illnessess? Are ther any other drugs coming along ion the states with fewer sides in the next two years? HELP and thanks for your opinions in advance",
