My words of advice only drink water when you get up in the morning before the test. Just because you failed the first one doesn't mean you'll fail the 3 hour one. I passed all 4 parts with flying colors and my mom had GD with all her kids.",

The results will be given to you after your blood is processed in the lab. I think mine was back the next day. They'll tell you how long to fast for and everything before you drink the drink.
