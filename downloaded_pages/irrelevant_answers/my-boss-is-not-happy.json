And maybe she doesn't realize she is coming off as mean, she could probably word things differently. I hope it gets better for you. If not, you could always try talking to her if that is something you would be comfortable with.",

The snacks you are eating are high in carbs and sugar (which you will have to limit if not eliminate if diagnosed with gestational diabetes-which I was)...\u00a0\u00a0granola bars have much more carbs and the process of dehydrating fruits concentratea all the sugars into small bites... trust me, you dont want gestational diabetes--- its a pain to deal with",

I'm 32+2 and I have a mixture of what I eat and yes honestly I eat a lot of sugar and have since the beginning of my pregnancy and have nothing wrong. My Dr actually tells me that I still need to eat more because um not very big. I look like I'm 5 or 6 months when I'm actually 8 months. Don't let anyone get you down. Congrats on the pregnancy and just keep your head up.",

I'm a cosmetologist and up until my BP went up at 24 weeks I did all the stuff and 10+ hrs a day I normally did. I have had to decrease hrs bc of hbp and swollen legs but will still throw in a 8 or 10 hr day here or there. I actually do living when supplies come in to put the boxes away etc but usually the girls I work with try to do it so I won't (at this point.) Good luck w the boss.",

    "question": "So i told my boss i was pregnant a week and a half ago and that im 10 weeks along. In that short period of time she has stated i can do anything i used to ex. Lifting and unpacking shipment and longer shifts ie 10 hours on my feet. And tonight she said i would regret snacking. The snacks im eating are grapes, banana, dried apricots and granola bars. And i only have 2 of them. One before my break and one after. My meals have been light and usually left overs or microwave meals like lean cuisine. I could understand if i was eating potato chips and mcdonalds for every meal, but im not. I havemt had a french fry in weeks. She and i got along great before i was pregnant, i just dont get where all of her negativity is coming from, and its really getting me down.\u00a0\u00a0She is a mother of two grown children,\u00a0\u00a0i really thought she would be more supportiveAny thoughts?",
