            "answer": "I think you already know the answer to that -- bp is in most cases a lifelong disorder.\u00a0\u00a0That means you will always need the meds -- at least that's what my pdoc has told me many times.\u00a0\u00a0There have been times when I felt really good for a long time, and I stopped taking the meds with the doc's approval -- and within a few months I was right back in his office.\u00a0\u00a0He knows what he is talking about -- he always knew I would be back on the meds.I know the meds are a pain in the butt and they often have side effects and they do not control everything 100% -- but they sure do a lot to relieve the ups and downs of bp and I could not live without them.Best of luck to you.",
