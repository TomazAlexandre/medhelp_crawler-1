    "question": "I am 58 and have been suffering from Diabetes for 27 years. I am on an Insulin pump and I have many complications, one of which includes Neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0Recently I had an orgasim and did not feel much sensation at all while it was occuring.\u00a0\u00a0My partner, who was giving me a hand release at the time, had to tell me that I had an orgasim as I really did not feel it.\u00a0\u00a0She also said it was different in the sense that there were smaller continuous portions of ejaculation rather than one large one. Does anyone know what might cause this to happen? I also had a difficult time achieving an erection while she was stimulating me. For the past 3-6 months I am not waking up in the morning with erections like I use to and not having them often at all.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for your help.",
