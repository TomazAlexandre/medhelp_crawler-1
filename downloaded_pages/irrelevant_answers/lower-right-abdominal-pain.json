            "answer": "Hello,There are many possibilities to your symptoms.Upper right abdominal pain can be caused by biliary colic, cholecystitis(inflammation of gall bladder), irritable bowel syndrome, hepatitis(inflammation of the liver), kidney stones, pneumonia, musculoskeletal pain,lower rib fracture and malignancy.Irritation of the nerves supplying this area can also cause pain.Irritation can be due to nerve compression or pinching due to any spine related pathology.Infemales,ovarian cysts can also cause pain in abdomen usually in lower part but it can be a referred pain in upper abdomen also.So ovarian cysts also have to be ruled out.Confirmation can be done only after ultrasound or CT abdomen.Blood tests may also be required in some cases.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "HiI can feel your exasperation and empathize with you. You have explained the situation very well. I read your post carefully and I realize you have right lower abdominal pain that at times radiates to your back.Three possibilities come to my mind; chronic involvement of appendix (many a times ultrasound misses this as the appendix in such cases is hidden behind loops of intestine and typical symptoms of appendicitis are\u00a0\u00a0absent), involvement of kidney and inflammation of your intestine. Refer: http://www.abdopain.com/lower-right-abdominal-pain.html for the various causes of right lower abdomen pain.Your diabetes doctor would be very helpful in controlling your sugar. You need to see a surgeon for this and I would recommend you do it soon.If you need more help, please feel free to contact. I\u2019ll be happy to answer your queries.",

    "question": "I have had type 1 diabetes for 18 years. For the past 4 years I have had lower abdomen pain in my right side. Even though I have had 4 ultrasounds done without any signs of a problem, my pain has never stopped and my diabetes doctor never does any other tests and doesn't seem at all concerned. I'm extremely concerned because sometimes the pain is a very sharp stabbing pain and the area feels swelled, tender, and painful to the touch. I have noticed that often, but not always, the pain worsens after I have eaten. Sometimes the pain is in my lower right abdomen, right side, and my right lower back all at the same time or sometimes the pain radiates in those areas. I am not a doctor so I don't have a clue what areas my doctor should check to help with my problem. To make a long story short, I think my doctor's a quack and I need some suggestions on my problem. Can anyone help?",
