            "answer": "Aside from possible digestive problems, I most definitely think you should have your heart totally checked out and make sure it's working like it's supposed to.\u00a0\u00a0You sound like somebody who is having heart trouble more than anything else.\u00a0\u00a0And yes, you could have an ulcer, I think they ought to do an endoscope and see what's going on in your tummy.\u00a0\u00a0One other item, how slow you are going, if it's not the heart, then it's possible that since you are in perimenopause, your thyroid might be acting up...this happens a lot in women approaching menopause, they can run a thyroid panel on you to see what's up, might be a temporary glitch that will go away on its own, but they DO have drugs to moderate it for a while.\u00a0\u00a0One more item, you COULD consider bioidentical hormones...I went natural, that's just how I see the whole thing.\u00a0\u00a0But you can talk to your gyn about what her expert opinion is on the issue.",

            "answer": "Thanks so much for your comments and advice. I will check with thedoc when I see her again this week.Regarding the thyroid issue, it is my understanding that they are currentlychecking this out but I don't have any results as yet.In relation to hormones - I have had TV\u00a0\u00a0and kidney scans regardingproblems I was having last year and was found to have fibroids anda thickened endometrium which they said accounted for my symptomsand the gyn wanted to perform a D&C which I didn't have because thesymptoms didn't bother me that much once I understood what wascausing them. I was also offered un named tablets to help which Ipresume were hormones. However, I think I have almost reachedmenopause so I will just let nature takes its course and support mybody to do this as best I can.I have been having a look around on tinternet and strongly suspectCANDIDA from what I have been reading as apparently it can haveabout 100 different symptoms!!! Will wait and see what results confirm.",

            "answer": "Make sure your doctor checks for diabetes and an abdominal aortic aneurysm too.The first because of the weight loss (which IBS or an ulcer won't usually do) and the second because of heart pounding, strange feelings in abdomen and back, etc.Both can be serious, get checked soon.",

My BP is usually on the low side.",

    "question": "HiMany thanks for taking the time out to answer this question.I woke up at 3.00a.m. and walked up the stairs to the bathroom. Reaching thetop of the stairs I suddenly got this INTENSE burning feeling all across mystomach, quite scary and unbearable. My heart was beating quite fast and I didfeel afraid. I recently had some tests done at the docs (but not yet got results)She is doing blood tests and also tests for celiac and infection. My stomachhas been burning on other occasions (but no where near this intensity) justmildly and a Rennie helps) Also had loose stools with malabsorption, lots ofwind and general 'windy' feeling in stomach and back.I have cut all possible sugar out of my diet - no junk food and beeneating gluten free products. Does this sound like I have developed an Ulcer?It passed very quickly and I felt shaky, then stomach noisy but otherwise ok. Iam also been treated for anxiety, panic and depression and in perimenopause.I suffer from insomnia (much worse since the onset of the digestive issues) andmost of my symptoms occur when waking from sleep. I feel really sluggish on amorning and it takes me ages to get going. I drink approx 5 glasses of water perday and weigh approx 112lbs but have lost about 7lbs in 6 weeks.Any thoughts/advice would be really appreciated.",
