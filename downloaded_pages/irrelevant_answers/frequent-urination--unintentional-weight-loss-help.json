You may need to adjust diet. If you are not on meds or insulin, you may need to start. If you are already on meds, they may need to be adjusted. Do you have a glucose meter? How have your readings been?",

            "answer": "Do you have a glucose meter? What's your morning and post meal numbers? If you don't have a meter, CVS has a great one if you have a CVS near you. The CVS Advanced Meter. The strips are very cheap. And it's very accurate. If you don't have a CVS near you, Walmart has the ReliOn Prime Meter. It's not as accurate as the CVS one in my opinion, but very affordable. You need to consult with your Dr ASAP. Your meds may need adjusting. I'd ask for a prescription for a meter too. You need to know what your sugar levels are daily. If he won't give a prescription for a meter, get one of the ones I listed above. They are affordable and will give you an idea of what your sugars are doing. Please see Dr ASAP. If you are losing weight and urinating that frequently, Id suspect your sugars are out of control. You don't wanna mess with that. It can cause all kinds of complications. If you can get meds, diet, and exercise right, you can live a normal life. Please see your Dr ASAP.",
