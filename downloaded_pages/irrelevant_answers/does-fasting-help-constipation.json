            "answer": "Hi!Fasting will make constipation worse by releasing more acids and causing more bloating and gas. Also, there will be no roughage to make the stool mass. Increase fiber in your diet. Eat lots of fresh fruits, vegetables, oats, porridge etc. Good sources of fiber are fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. In addition you can try bulk stool softener such as psyllium (Metamucil) or methylcellulose (Citrucel). Remember too much of fiber and not proportionate increase in fluid can also cause constipation. Consult your doctor regarding this.Chronic constipation can be due to diet poor in roughage or fiber, dehydration, diabetes, hypothyroidism, colon disorders, irritable bowel syndrome, diverticular diseases, cancers, severe acidity etc. It can also be due to milk allergy and other food allergies. The cause has to be found and treated. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem",

            "answer": "Hi there!Fasting would not help with constipation. Constipation could occur secondary to dietary intake, GI obstruction, growths/ masses, secondary to GI infections/ inflammations, GI motility issues, hormonal/ endocrine issues, stress/ anxiety, medication side effect etc. You could try OTC laxatives/ glycerine suppositories and see if these seem to help. If you do not notice any improvement with OTC medications, it is best advised to consider an evaluation by a primary care physician or a gastroenterologist for a detailed evaluation and suggestion of an appropriate management plan.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
