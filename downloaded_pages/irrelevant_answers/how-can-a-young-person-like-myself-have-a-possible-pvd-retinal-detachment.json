    "question": "I am 23, Healthy, no diseases such as Diabetes,I see very well, I can red something very far and very near, no blows to the eye, I had a bunch of floaters in my eye, went to two eye doctors one a retina specialist and they found nothing at all. This was a year ago. I have no traces of Retinal Detachment in my family.Nothing has changed to make my eyes damaged, I still have floaters but a new set of them that I have not notice before and not only that, if I move my eyes all the way to the left and right it looks like light sometimes a shadow circle following my eyes constantly, its not very big but its noticeable. Isnt that a sign of a R/D? Could it be an optical migraine?",
