            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.It could take up to four weeks for the swelling and inflammation to subside. In Addition to Zyrtec, you could use saline nasal sprays. Also, try to sleep on your side, this will help to open up the nasal passages. Hope diabetes has been ruled out. If your symptoms worsen, or if there is discharge or if you develop fever, consult your doctor to rule out an infection.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
