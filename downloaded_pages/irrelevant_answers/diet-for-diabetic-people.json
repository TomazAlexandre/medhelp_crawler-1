            "answer": "The thing with diabetes is that we are all different. Some people can tolerate say whole wheat bread items and a moderate amount of fruit. Others of us have very limited ability to eat those things. For nearly every diabetic, sugar (which is the simplest carb) is going to jack up their blood sugar, and the more time spent with high blood sugar the more likely the occurance of diabetic complications such as loss of limbs and kidney failure. \"If they've been good???\" We are adults and can learn to treat ourselves in ways that don't damage our health. But sugar is just the worst carb, all carbs raise blood sugar, which means things like cereal, rice, potatoes and pasta. It doesn't mean she can never eat those things. It just means they need to be limited.That being said, the main way to find out what works for your mother is to test, test, test. Eat something and then two hours after the meal test the blood sugar. The goal is to be under 140.",
