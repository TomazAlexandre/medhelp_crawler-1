            "answer": "This won't make you feel much better either - but diet and excercise may keep off the worse complications for awhile.\u00a0\u00a0But not forever.\u00a0\u00a0You'll need the insulin sensitizer pills (which, compared to giving yourself insulin injections, is not the end of the world).Most Type 2's I know developed Type 1 over a period of time as they got older.\u00a0\u00a0Keep that in mind.Type 2, although more common than Type 1, is also the hardest to keep under control and if left untreated or haphazzardly treated - also results in the most Kidney, Retinal, and Heart disease complications.For many Type 2's - if they are obese, excercise and diet reduces the insulin insensitivity to the point where - in many cases but not all - you can get along with diet and exercise for a long time.\u00a0\u00a0The catch - you must stick to the diet and exercise regiment.\u00a0\u00a0It's not like an Atkins diet fad you go on or off.Another thing to keep in mind - diet and exercise and insulin sensitizers will not make it go away.\u00a0\u00a0You go off your diet and exercise regiment or \"relax\" and get casual about it - it will come back.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes with very nasty results.",
