    "question": "i keep gettin big sore spots on my female genitalia and upper thigh, groin and sometimes around my nicker line. they have been getting worse. wot can it be? they go fairly deep once they pop. i have tryed to pop them and they are incredibaly sore. they ooze puss like a spot bu8uut on a larger scale, then followed by some blood. i had oral sex with a stanger nearly a year ago, so i dont no if its linked to this or not . i think i had them before that tho. they do consern me as they leave open wounds and take over a week to heal. they vary from around3days to 10 days as an advrade to first arive to poping. they get to about the size of a 5 pence coin sometimses bigger.",
