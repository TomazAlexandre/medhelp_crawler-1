            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Hyperthyroidism should definitely be looked into since you have shakiness and loose stools. Also please get sleep studies done. Sleep deprivation and improper sleep can cause a number of problems.The symptoms that you have enumerated point more towards spinal nerve compression at the cervical vertebral level. CT scans and MRI were done on the neck? High or low blood pressure and postural hypotension should be ruled out. It is possible that your blood pressure drops when you stand up from a sitting position.Internal ear problems should be looked into and so also the MRI of the cerebellum of brain should be done.Chronic diarrhea can be due to parasitic infestations.\u00a0\u00a0Other causes are irritable bowel syndrome, Coelic disease, Crohn\u2019s disease, malabsorption syndromes, pancreatic diseases, diabetes, hyperthyroidism etc. Chronic loose stool itself can cause a number of nutritional deficiencies.TIA and epilepsies are the other possibilities.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
