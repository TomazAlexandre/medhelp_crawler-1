            "answer": "I posted to your other question but I just wanted to post here too just in case. I have hashimotos too, I also have poly cystic ovaries and some other health problems. I've had problems with it for years and I'm only 23! After being put on metformin for poly cystic ovaries and pre-diabetes I got pregnant within a month! I had a rough pregnancy and for the last few months I was limited to very little activity because I had high blood pressure and pre eclampsia. I also had gestational diabetes and my thyroid did not want to cooperate! I had to see a high risk specialist as well as my regular OB. My OB said I was lucky to even be pregnant much less to make it through the pregnancy. Scared as I was (single mom) I thank God for my daughter everyday.Struggles sometimes make you appreciate the good... I know its hard to deal with and I definetly feel for you. Have you seen a endocrine dr that specializes in reproductive issues? I've heard they were really good at dealing with issues like yours. I do hope you get something worked out!!! Again, you will be in my prayers.",
