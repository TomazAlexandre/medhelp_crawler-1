We spend so much time feeling ill that after awhile we sometimes embrace it. I am struggling with that now-thinking about how I am going to change my narrative, so to speak. If I am getting well, I am ecstatic, but it has dawned on me that I need to relearn how to live as a healthy person and to drop all the fear and negatives. Hang in there and try not to give support to the negative thoughts and feelings that are a part of this disease and treatment.",

I was just very recently in TX and for the 2 years I have been symptomatic, I have gone through hell, up and down. People with liver disease typically (esp. if they are symptomatic) suffer from pain,fears, anger and general malaise. Furthermore if she gets treatment with the newer drugs, she may not have the most severe response that many people have to interferon and riba.This is a tremendously hard time for all of us.",

It is hard when we are dealing with just typing, so many things can be taken the wrong way. I personally, have no intention of making anybody's life more difficult on this board and if I see somebody having a bad day, or being crabby, I don't ever take it personal. Everyone it seems is under a lot of stress right now and I don't think anybody can corner the market on pain and therefore portray everybody else should be happy and not complain because there are people with worse situations.I personally just want to give everybody a Hug and make their life better. Nobody deserves any of this and we all, in our own way, are trying our best to cope and get through another day...oh and my daughter got my meds from Fed ex and put in freezer today ruining them!
