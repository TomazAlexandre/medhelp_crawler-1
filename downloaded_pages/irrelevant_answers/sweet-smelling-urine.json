            "answer": "Yes, you must see your Endo as soon as possible. Hashimoto's Disease often is associated with type 1 diabetes. A sweet smelling urine, along with frequent peeing, indicates excess glucose [blood sugar] is being expelled by your kidneys. Your kidneys act as a filter. If damaged excess glucose sneaks past the leaky filter into your urine. You want to prevent further damage so a doctor is in order.Diabetes tests are in order as well as reviewing your Levothyroxine dosage. You can help yourself in the meantime by lowering your simple carb intake, avoiding sugary foods and starches, and perform some sort of physical exercise daily. Discuss with your Endo or ask to speak with an diabetes nutritionist about diet plans. Good luck",

            "answer": "You're welcome, Crystalann. Sugar comes in different varieties other than refined table sugar, or in your case, coffeemate. Google simple carbs vs complex carbs. Simple carbs are digested easily thus their sugars enter the bloodstream more quickly resulting in your glucose levels being jacked up. White foods are considered simple carbs; white flour, white bread, crackers, potatoes, pasta, and milk. Also, read the ingredient label carefully on packaged foods. Sugars listed under carbohydrates are in grams. Every 7 grams equals one heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar.",

    "question": "For the past 3 weeks my urine has been smelling like sugar smacks (sugary cereal). I usually frequently urinate many many times throughout the day and night, but the smell is new. I've been very hungry and thirsty for a couple months now. I have no UTI symptoms and I'm Negative for pregnancy. I am 25 and have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis\u00a0\u00a0(on Levoxyl for almost 2 years) and Fibromyalgia (on amiltriptyline for 9 months). Should I consult a doctor and get tested for diabetes?Thanks",
