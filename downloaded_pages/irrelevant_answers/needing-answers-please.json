            "answer": "I am reluctant to suggest this, but have you had an HIV test?Change physicians. I have very little tolerance for idiots in my life and anyone who diagnoses your condition in the manner you describe (and I am not sure he did so, because all we have is hearsay) should not be treating human beings.There are a dozen possibilities besides HIV, but you appear to immunocompromised. Mold is unlikely, but not an unreasonable possibility.You have to find some who can give you a diagnosis.Flee your current health care provider and find someone who takes you seriously.",
