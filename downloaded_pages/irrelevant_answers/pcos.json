            "answer": "I have pcos also they put me on metformin. Its supposed to be for diabetes but apparently it can help regulate your hormones making it easier to get pregnant. Once you have a confirmed pregnancy they switch you to something to aid with progesterone so the pregnancy will stick. I had issues with the metformin though and it can make you gain weight I just had to relax and not worry about it and surprising I got pregnant within 2 months first time and 4 months the second. Best of luck to you!!!",

Also, my dr put me on a pill to induce my period (the idea being that inducing your period will trick your body into ovulating). I am 40w1d with my second boy!",
