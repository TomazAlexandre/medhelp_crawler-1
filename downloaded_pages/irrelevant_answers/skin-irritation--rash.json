    "question": "Hi all,My mother has been diagnosed with diabetes for nearly ten years. However, recently she has developed what looks like a rash on the back of her hands. It does not itch/burn or hurt and causes no discomfort. The best way to describe it is as a what looks and feels like a burn. Its red and you can feel it, so its not under her skin. I have been told this may just be a symptom of diabetes, can anyone tell me if it is possible that it is something else?Thank you in advance",
