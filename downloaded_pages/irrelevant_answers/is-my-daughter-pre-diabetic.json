            "answer": "I agree that these don't sound like the typical symptoms of diabetes. Headaches could mean vision problems, though. Or allergies. Might want to have eyes checked out in case she needs glasses. Or see if her headaches seem to coincide with high pollen days.Another thought about headaches... (there are SO many possible causes for headaches!!!) see if there is any pattern to when she gets headaches. Some people get headaches when blood sugar drops, so if they tend to happen when she hasn't eaten for a long time or right after meals, you may want to ask her doctor to check for hypoglycemia.",

    "question": "Hi I have a concern about my 7 year old daughter. First let me start by saying that Diabetes runs in my Husbands side of the family. His mother has insulin dependent diabetes as well as his oldest sister, who has suffered retinal neuropathy and lost her eye. My daughter is of healthy weight and eats fairly well for a child her age.\u00a0\u00a0We take vitamins and minerals, fish oil and probiotics for healthy digestion. Lately she has been complaining of her hands hurting when she wakes up in the mornings. I ask her if it is numb kind of hurt or just an ache (growing pains possibly)She also has been complaining of headaches. I don't know if this is possibly a pinched nerve or should I have her tested? She does not seem to exhibit any other symptoms of being pre diabetic that I know of. Any advice?",
