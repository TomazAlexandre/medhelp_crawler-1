            "answer": "I'm sorry I'm only used to the English or the American numbers and can't really interpret Blood Glucose in that format. However, since you included the lab range I can see that it is definitely above normal. My question is do you test at home? You mention a blood pressure device but nothing about a glucose meter. Testing at home, you should do fasting in the morning, than two hours after each meal. The after meal tests will show you how the food is affecting his blood sugar and you can make changes based on that information. I can only tell you in my numbers the after meal should be under 140.It does sound like he is making progress, so whatever you are doing, keep it up. It sometimes takes awhile for Metformin to start taking effect. The testing will give you information as to how he is doing with his diet and exercise.",

    "question": "Hi all,Am in search of opinions / advice on the following.My husband (44 years old, overweight, sedentary & stressed lifestyle) was diagnosed with Type II diabetes on May 15th, with a sugar level of 3.30g. His cholesterol was also high and he's been on hypertension meds since 2005 which have brought his BP down to lower levels (126/71 according to reading we've just done).He was prescribed METFORMINE 1000 mg twice a day.We have made major modifications to our diet since then - vastly reduced alcohol consumption, elimination for now of potatoes, white bread, white pasta and quick sugars etc, reduced consumption of anything mid range or highish on the glycaemic index and increased consumption of veggies.My question is, in the light of preceding information, is a blood sugar reading of 2.07g, in your view, bad news or rather a positive indicator ? I ask because after 5 weeks of diabetes meds and changed diet and habits, the reading still seemed too high to me ...Really would appreciate your feedback.Best,MP",
