            "answer": "I used to be super fit...could leap up 3 stairs in a single bound, walk carrying a baby and 3 bags of groceries up hill for over 2 kilometres ..then I got the dreaded THYROID DISEASE...I ached all over, failed miserably in the get out of bed department, and before I knew it had turned into a blob..so I didn't bother. Too tiring anyway!BUT then something happened...First of all I had my thyroid totally removed due to a cancer scare....then I found out my close aunt got diabetes...well, I measured my waist and it was 102 cms...to avoid diabetes it should be 81 cms....so I got my butt up and started to do itty bitty bits of excersise...and now only a few months later I have lost a whole 10 kilos!I still get total exhaustion but I think having men look at me again and my ex-boyfriend now starting to think he wants to be my boyfriend again, and the diabetes scare sure are helping!Just take it slow and mark on a calendar what you did...that's how I started.. you then see what you did and you realise it felt good to see the progress!Good luck!",

            "answer": "Okay, I'll hold you accountable. Don't you owe it to yourself to be the best YOU you can be?\u00a0\u00a0I tell my kids this all time....you only get one body in this lifetime and it's up to you to take care of it.\u00a0\u00a0Get off your butt and quit making excuses. There. Feel guilty now?\u00a0\u00a0:)I do exercise everyday, it's part of who I am and it empowers me.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 42 and I started running about 12 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Started out just walking with a girlfriend everyday and then she moved away and I didn't have anyone to walk with. So I tried jogging a little at a time and before I knew it I able to run miles without stopping. She moved back and we started running together and eventually we were running about 10 miles most days of the week.\u00a0\u00a0During that time I had a hysterectomy and within 2 weeks of my surgery I was running again.\u00a0\u00a0I was always the stick skinny girl with no shape and suddenly I had an athletic looking body and I liked that!\u00a0\u00a0I liked that I could keep up with my kids, play soccer with them, take them to the park and go all day.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I'm older and I'm definitely not running 10 miles anymore but I do make it about 4 or so most days of the week. And the best thing is that I believe I set an example for my teenage son and daughter.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, mom had cancer and was so sick for about 6 months. But during that hypohe// I was still out walking a mile or so when I could barely function. I did it for ME. I did it for THEM.\u00a0\u00a0I'm strong, I'm fit and I kicked cancer's butt.\u00a0\u00a0Do it for YOU.",

            "answer": "Thanks Liz!! You are right! I know I will feel so much better and empowered!! I filled out a health questionaire last week and when i go in next monday I have a feeling he will talk about exercise. Many doctors dont push exercise but he has been so thorough its unbelievable! This will be my 3rd visit. He has me on vitamin d 50,000 iu once a week, testosterone gel, and armour 3 times a day. He is an awesome Endo! He is so nice and humble. He draws charts for me explaining what is going on with my t3 and t4, they were low. Thanks for your encouragement! Have a great day!!!!",

    "question": "I hate to admit this. How many of you exercise regularly? I just wont do it! I know I need to. I used to be athletic when I was young. I feel better the few times I do exercise. I think my Doctor might talk to me about it on the 17th! I filled out a health questionaire last week when I did my bone density test.",
