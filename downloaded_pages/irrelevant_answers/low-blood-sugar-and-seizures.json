            "answer": "Yes, you should be concerned. My guess is, from what you say, that your boyfriend is not taking care of his diabetes properly. Large amounts of weight gain can lead to insulin resistance in a type 1 and then they have even more difficulty in managing their diabetes. Frequent severe lows that lead to seizures are a serious problem. My guess is he is also suffering frequent highs that lead to longterm complications. Does he test (most type 1's test about 8 times a day), does he do an insulin:carb ratio to determine his bolus (before mealtime) dose. I would be very surprised if he was properly caring for his diabetes. What can you do about it? That is entirely another story. It is hard to change another person especially if they don't want to change. All you can do is express concern for him and offer to help. Send me a PM if you want and I will send you a website where you can talk with other loved ones of diabetics.",

    "question": "I have been dating my boyfriend for a 1 1/2years now. I have learned how notice when he is having low blood sugar and usually can notice the signs and help him out before anything major happens. I am very concerned about him though. He is 32 and was diagnosed with diabetes at age 5. I am sure he knows more about this than me, but I still worry. He smokes and drinks alchol weekly with friends. He feels that by him going to the gym to work out and involving himself in volleyball leagues to keep himself in shape that it will counter act the alchol and smoking. His weight gain has increased. His stomach is very firm but has the look of a 7-9 month pregnant lady. Between all of this I was not too concerned but now his sugar levels seem to going low more frequent into seizures. He is having one at least once a week it seems and at times more than that. His mood swings toward me are bad at times. He is either really happy or very irritated with me. I am worried that the effects of a bad life style and his health problems are catching up to him. Should I be concerned?",
