            "answer": "I reviewed our prior communication and recalled there was a ring enhancing lesion probably in the right part of the brain which has probably caused your left sided symptoms. It is quite possible that the fluctuation could be due to the resolving lesion. Another possiblity would be seizures, but less likely. In some patients with brain/cord lesions that cause tone problems, the symptoms can sometimes get worse with fatigue or stress. As long as you are continuing to improve and are being closely followed by ?six neurologists, you should be ok. GOod luck",

            "answer": "This is my first time entering anything . And I hope that I am entering it in the right place. I have type 2 Diabetes and have had it for about 4 years. I have had some burning sensations on the side of my leg and numbness too. It wasn't too bad until I was just in the hospital getting a kidney stone taken out. Well I have never felt such pain. I was ordering pain pills for my legs instead of the surgical procedure. The pain was in my groin area and I could not move an inch one way or the other without letting out a little scream.\u00a0\u00a0Is this what neuropothy feels like???\u00a0\u00a0And what kind of a doctor should I be seeking out?",

    "question": "I experience muscle tone/spasticity on my left side which is caused by an undetermined cause (read dr.'s baffled below).\u00a0\u00a0my question is the amount of tone/spasticity i experience greatly varies from day to day and even hour to hour.\u00a0\u00a0i can have 3-4 days in a row of mininmal tone/spasticity in which my functioning improves, then 3-4 days of severe tone/spasticity where my functioning is greatly diminished.\u00a0\u00a0sometimes this changes from hour to hour.the six neurologists i've seen have no explanation.\u00a0\u00a0the only thing i was ever told was maybe because my brain is healing, as shown by mri's, the brain is healing and this is what causes these waves in symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0could this be?",
