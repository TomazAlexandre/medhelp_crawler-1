            "answer": "LOL! Don't be worried. My baby weighed 7.1 lbs at 37 weeks and newborns only gain half a pound a week until delivery unless you have gestational diabetes, then your baby is likely (not always the case) to gain additional weight. Your baby will be around 9lbs which is perfect!!!",

            "answer": "Well if you want your baby to come early and maybe avoid a C-Section just try going for walks, get ur feet massaged, drink raspberry leaf tea, and i know there are many more... Thats what I did and my boy came about 2 weeks early and he was 7.9 lbs.. My last 2 hours of labor was really hard so I can only imagine if I went full term how big he maybe.. Though I also agree Rahs. to not worry too much, everything will turn out GREAT and once your baby is delivered your heart will just melt!!",

    "question": "I'm currently 37 weeks, 6 days. Just had an ultrasound, they said my bby is already at 7lbs almost 8. I was watching as they measured the head, body, stomach, etc. Does anyone go by these ultrasounds ? Or can they be off ? Im a little worried that labour might be hard. By the time I hit 40 weeks, he might be 11 lbs ! Yikes. I ask because many friends tell me not too go by the ultrasounds. Idk. But, ladis what do u think ?",
