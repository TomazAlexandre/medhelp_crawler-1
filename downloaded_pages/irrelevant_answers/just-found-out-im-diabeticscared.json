            "answer": "I just found out a week ago that I have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Like you, I was very scared. I am a 43 year old female and I am morbidly overweight (289 pounds).\u00a0\u00a0I have been a drinker for the last 23 years (brandy).\u00a0\u00a0While I'm sure drinking wasn't the one major factor in me acquiring diabetes it may have contributed to it since alcohol is loaded with sugar.\u00a0\u00a0We have diabetes because our cells doesn't respond very well to the insulin the pancreas puts out.\u00a0\u00a0I quit drinking and smoking two and a half months before I found out I had diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I now walk every day for at least 30 minutes and I count my carbs and eat a healthy and well balanced meal.Just because you have diabetes it doesn't have to have you.\u00a0\u00a0As long as you exercise and eat right you can manage your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It doesn't have to be a death sentence.\u00a0\u00a0Many people with diabetes live long lives because they have it under control.\u00a0\u00a0In just one short week, my glucose level went from 148 to 114 fasting time.\u00a0\u00a0After meals it went from 188 to 107.\u00a0\u00a0As long as you're serious about getting it under control you can do it.\u00a0\u00a0What did it for me is when my doctor told me I was at risk for a heart attack just like someone that has already had one.So make sure your fasting levels are between 70-100 and your after meals levels are under 180, although endocrinologist like for it to be under 140.\u00a0\u00a0You'd be surprised at the variety of foods you can eat while being a diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Only thing...you just can't have too much of it.So, start smiling and start living!\u00a0\u00a0This can be the beginning of newer, healthier you!Good luck!",
