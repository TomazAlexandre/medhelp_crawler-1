            "answer": "Hi Cara.... I also have a thyroid problem...and yes, you need to get that TSH down to 1-2.... I have been on synthyroif for about 10 years and have it checked everymonth...\u00a0\u00a0If you do get pregnant, then you are more likely to m/c without synthroid or other treatment...so you need to go see an endocrinologist and get this taken care of....ASAP...Good work on lowering the other number!!! It does take a lot of work, but you can do it and will do it!!!Good Luck!!! Jacquie",

            "answer": "One thing they need to check is Free T4, also if you have thyroid problems, you need to be on meds.\u00a0\u00a0I had two miscarriages back to back.\u00a0\u00a0My 1st one was at 11w4d in 3/05, my 2nd one was at 5 weeks in 7/05.\u00a0\u00a0This was after having three healthy children.\u00a0\u00a0After talking to the doctor, he decided it was probably b/c of not being on my thyroid meds and put me back on them.\u00a0\u00a0He told me to wait four months before trying to conceive again, which I said I wasn't going to do, couldn't handle any more losses.\u00a0\u00a0However, by 10/05 I found out I was pregnant again and in 6/06 gave birth to a healthy baby boy.\u00a0\u00a0They did a lot of level II u/s during my pregnancy to keep a check on the baby's thyroid gland, but all was fine.\u00a0\u00a0I am now fixing to be 20 weeks with my pregnancy now and am still on my meds (PTU) and still have level II u/s about every 4 weeks or so to keep a check on the baby.\u00a0\u00a0So far everything is good.\u00a0\u00a0So, I would definately get on meds if you have any problems going on what so ever before even trying to conceive.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you the best of luck and keep us posted.",

            "answer": "I had my thyroid removed a few years ago and have been on synthyroid for sometime. I feel fine on it as long as my levels are stable, which they have been. I am currently 17 weeks prego and have not had to adjust my medication yet. I think if you are regulated and on meds, you are just as likely as normal to carry to term. I am hoping at least!Maybe your dosage was off? That is common. Just a guess. I had an ajustment from .125 to .15 and it made a huge difference in how I felt.Good luck!!",

    "question": "I'm 28 and I want to get pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I've had diabetes for 11 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0My Thyroid has been borderline for 3 years.\u00a0\u00a0In Oct '06 my A1C was 7.0.\u00a0\u00a0My doc said I couldn't get pregnant with it at that level.\u00a0\u00a0He said nothing about my tsh which was 4.5.\u00a0\u00a0So, I worked hard and got my A1C down to 6.0!\u00a0\u00a0But now my thyroid is 7.08 and he said I can't get pregnant it at that level.\u00a0\u00a0I felt like he ripped out my heart when he told me that especially because I worked so hard to get my A1C down.I'm leary about going on synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to put drugs in my body if I don't need to.\u00a0\u00a0I've tried it a couple years ago and felt worse on it.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not totally convinced I have hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like my TSH levels are always higher in the winter months.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible it could just be a seasonal variation in my levels?\u00a0\u00a0What causes the TSH level to go up and down?\u00a0\u00a0What does my TSH level need to be before I can try to get pregnant?\u00a0\u00a0What if I do nothing, will it hurt me or my baby?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any other alternatives besides synthroid to help lower the TSH?\u00a0\u00a0I really want to have a baby, I would consider adopting, but I really want my own.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also scared because I eat right/excerise/don't smoke/drink and my body is failing.\u00a0\u00a0My pancreas is already dead, now my thyroid, what am I doing wrong?I will appreciate any insight.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks.",
