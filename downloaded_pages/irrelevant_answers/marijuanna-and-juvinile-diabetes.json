            "answer": "Dear Baddiabetic,Other than the fact that is usi ng an illegal drug but the euphoric effect of marihuana might make him forget to care properly his diabetes. The only other thing i've ever heard about smoking marihuana and diabetes is that the munchies you get from the drug may have you eating more than is in your diet.Good luck with stopping, bret",

            "answer": "It depends on the individual using it.Observe his actions when he is high. If he is constantly in the kitchen, constantly eating junk or over-eating, then he has a\u00a0\u00a0problem with the munchies. Smoking ganja stimulates receptors that prolongs the feeling of 'hunger', when in fact you are not hungry.Therefore constant eating will obviously elevate the blood sugar.I can be sure, I speak from experience on this, and I've been trying to cut down smoking it.Comfort lies in the hope that this is merely a phase that people my age go through, and sooner or later we wise up.God Bless",

            "answer": "Marijuana, like any other recreational drug, increases diabetic complications three fold.\u00a0\u00a0This means that you will lose your sight and be blind three times quicker than if you didn't smoke marijuana or anything else for that matter.\u00a0\u00a0Recreational drug use causes you to not pay attention to your blood sugar and how your body is feeling/reacting.\u00a0\u00a0This creates a situation where your blood sugars are high and your heart, kidneys, lungs, skin, etc. are affected.\u00a0\u00a0How do I know all this?\u00a0\u00a0I know because my diabetic son was a user and died two years ago of kidney and heart failure due to diabetic complications.\u00a0\u00a0He was 33 years old and was also blind.\u00a0\u00a0The dr.'s told us he would have lived much longer if he had not been a drug user and had taken better care of himself.\u00a0\u00a0Don't doubt me on this one.\u00a0\u00a0It's fact.\u00a0\u00a0My heart knows because I will miss him forever.\u00a0\u00a0Don't play games or mess with your life.\u00a0\u00a0Someone cares.",

            "answer": "I'm type I and 22, and have been diabetic for 12 years.\u00a0\u00a0I never would have used marijuanna when I was 15!\u00a0\u00a0At the time, I felt that diabetes had taken some control away from me of my body, and I didn't want to loose anymore control with drugs.\u00a0\u00a0In the past few years though I have use marijuanna occasionally, and am able to maintain ok control when on it.\u00a0\u00a0However, I can maintain much better control of my BS on marijuanna than when drinking alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0I think if your son is only going to use it once in a while, it is fine.\u00a0\u00a0I think the only tricky thing is to manage the munchies.\u00a0\u00a0Something that might help is to get him prepackaged delicious foods(bags of chips or cookies, or prewrapped ice cream cones, etc, and throw in some low carb options too like nuts, lunch meat, veggies,etc) for when he gets the munchies, so that he will know how much to bolus (this might sound a bit odd, but I find that the difficult\u00a0\u00a0part of bolusing for the munchies, is remembering how much food I actually ate).\u00a0\u00a0I would be more cautious with him about alcohol, which is significantly more difficult to navigate as a diabetic (though it can be done, if he is willing to drink in moderation).\u00a0\u00a0I can't imagine being in your position as a mother, how stressful, but just like everything else in his life, he will probably have an out of range blood sugar after he uses marijuanna (like he would if he played basketball for the first time, or took a stressful test for the first time), and will learn from it and improve his control the next time he uses it.

            "answer": "Hmm, smoking pot daily may not be the best idea for somebody with diabetes, but then again it probably isn't the best idea for anybody. I have been smoking for about a year now and I have found that it doesn't really hinder my blood sugar control. While no physician would tell your son what he's doing is a good idea, I would be much more concerned if he was into heavy drinking. If the smoking gets in the way of testing blood sugars and correct insulin dosing or he begins to have more breathing difficulties than he used to, it is time to cut back, but I would tell him to be weary of other drugs, especially alcohol. Although it is one of the only legal recreational drugs that is widely used, it is also one of the most dangerous for diabetics. While getting a little drunk every once in a while is probably okay for a diabetic, getting super drunk is not, but as far as the herb goes, pretty much toke up as much as you'd like (with some common sense guidelines of course).",

            "answer": "I am 29, a diabetic since 7 years ago. I used to smoke MJ before my diabetes and I was alright, school, family...all. Well I couldn't stop smoking MJ just because of my diabetes, both things diabetes and MJ being part of my way of living, so I continued. I tell you something, personally it never harmed me in any way, but sure it still makes me eat much more when getting high. If you smoke in a moderate manner (max. 1 joint a day) I guess you should be OK. The only bad thing in my humble opinion is the drinking of alcoholic beverages. These chemicals well known as alcohol are really really bad for a diabetic, especially a young one. Please find yourself a different way of getting loose than alcohol consumption",

            "answer": "I actually just ran upon this and quite enjoyed these responses(especially syd420). I too have diabetes Mellitus (i am 20 now and got it when I was 11). I do produce SOME insulin, so perhaps it just depends on each individual diabetic. What i do NOT believe is that MJ can actually HURT a diabetic... because it's not the weed that's doing it, it's the person. You can't blame your 33 year old son's death on pot... because it wasn't the pot. Unfortunately, it was simply his decisions that he made while being high. Being diabetic is hard without being high... I hate it, I hate remembering to take shots, or check my blood sugar... i hate feeling like I have high or low blood sugar... it's a horrible, undeserved, stressful disease. However, if it's your own choice to feast when you have the Munchies... well that's your own dumb fault. If you're going to eat, take insulin too. If you're not going to eat, well you're better off! up until these past 2 years, I never touched pot.... my blood sugars were anywhere from 300-'HI' on my glucose meter (which is something like 600+)... making my A1C around 9.0... when I started smoking pot, I told myself ahead of time, \"Ok, you don't know what this will do, but check your blood sugar every hour while high, don't feed more than normal...\" Guess what? I have an A1C of 6.0 every 3 months I get tested. MJ does not harm you, you harm yourself. If anything, especially if you can't control you blood sugars and can't afford that pill that regulates it... I'd actually SUGGEST MJ! For all I know, if I'd never started smoking... I could be dead right now, or at least lost a limb, gone blind, or gotten nerve damage. I thank God ever day for his blessing... a weed he created that helps multiple diseases (and disorders). Luckily, scientists are doing more research on this theory... so far, my hypotheses (MJ doesn't harm, You harm) is correct. :) If you're going to use a 'drug', use it smart.last note:Cardiovascular diseases... >> 806,156Malignant neoplasms.........>> 562,875Motor Vehicle Crashes.......>> 43,945Drug induced1\t................>> 38,371Septicemia (infections).......>> 34,828Suicide.............................>> 34,598by Firearms.......................>> 31,224Accidental poisoning...........>> 29,846Alcohol induced..................>> 23,199Homicide............................>> 18,361Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)..>>11,295Viral hepatitis......................>> 7,407Cannabis (Marijuana) >>>>>>>\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0 <<<<<<<<<<<",

            "answer": "Jesus!!! 15 years old?? So poking smot really doesn't do anything negative... lol it doesn't kill you. It doesn't make you smarter we all know that. It doesn't make you steal or kill other people. But come on! When have you even seen a chronic pot smoker win the world cup lol or become very successful, aside from Mr. Snoop Dogg. So in reality, you should try to let him know (if this is your standpoint) that it's ok to smoke weed in moderation, but maybe he should making that decision when he is graduated and living under his own roof paying his own bills. Until then, he needs to start accomplishing some goals lol Which I am assuming is not yet happened since he has been smoking every day! On a lighter note, usually kids that have parents that don't persecute them and still support and uplift them no matter what usually stop using after a while because they see that their life is going nowhere and start making a change.. So try to put in some kind of advice but don't persecute him, try to get him to set his own goals and don't set them for him. Damn I still can't believe 15 lol this question was asked in 2006 so I am wondering how the id is doing now? He is what, 20? 21? maybe?",
