            "answer": "Hello...What you describe is almost exactly what I have been feeling since April of this year. In addition to what you've described...I suffer a burning pain just below my right rib area and dizziness. My pain in lower back into right hip and cervical/neck pain are unreal. My headaches come nearly everyday and the fatigue is crushing. I have never been diagnosed with fibromyalgia however, I was diagnosed with CFIDS twenty years ago whe I was your age. I treated with alternative medicine for years and got some relief but since April of this year I've gotten much worse.I've had evry test and scan known to man...including ct scans of abdomen, octreotide scan, mri of abdomen and brain, upper endoscopy and countless blood tests. Everything was within normal limits except for a benign hemangioma on my liver. I am scheduled for a colonoscopy on Nov. 18....doctor believes it may show nothing. He has even gone so far as to suggest this may all be due to stress and /or depression! I've lost 14 lbs. since April and cannot gain a pound! I am also terrified that one of the scans missed something.It sounds to me that you may have CFIDS as well as Fibromyalgia. Have you looked on the CFIDS.org website at the symptoms? I tend to believe that what you describe and what I am experiencing are autoimmune in nature. If that is the case, mainstream doctors are probably not going to figure it out.Let me know if you've looked into CFIDS...don't give up searching i the meantime. I know how hard it is to feel poorly everyday....believe me I do.",

            "answer": "It would be nice to simply send over House, M.D. :) A friend of mine was diagnosed with proximal tachacardia in his early 30's. It was a precursor symptom to diabetes. So, the best thing you can do is cut out drinking alcohol and/or soda for one. Don't binge drink! Cut out all unhealthy habits.You might want to monitor blood sugar if there's a history of diabetes in your family. Often times people don't know since one of their parents are adopted. Try changing your day-to-day patterns and make notes.This could be stress-related, too. So (even though this may sound corny) just relax and let life work itself the way it will. Take stock of all the positives. Make an effort to think positively for a few minutes and relax before going to bed. It might help!",
