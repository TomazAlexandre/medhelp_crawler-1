    "question": "Hello,I am a straight male in my 20's. 6 months ago I had a one night stand with a high risk partner. I was very drunk, but used a condom and don't think it split/came off. I also performed oral sex on her. Since that night i've had so many problems. This is the only sexual encounter I have had from then until now. My problems:About 3 - 4 weeks after this night I found that I had a fungal rash of the groin (front and back). I've been unable to fully get rid of this despite consistent daily topical lotions for 5 months.About 2 months after I felt that my tongue was yellow and dry. I was treated for oral thrush but it didn't help. I had a positive test confirming oral thrush a couple of weeks ago. I've now had this for 4 to 5 months. 3 x Fluconazole did not clear it. Oral thrush is very rare in healthy people. I had a test for diabetes and other possible causes - all negative.I got impetigo a month ago - this seems to now have cleared.I have facial itching and my doctor thinks that it is serborrheic dermatitis. I also have a very sore throat which i've had for the last 4 weeks and a small white patch on the back of my throat.All of these things are opportunistic infections and common with HIV sufferers. One month after the one night stand I had an HIV test (antigen and antibody) and this came back negative. I had another antibody test after 3 months. This also came back negative. But i still suffer from all of these ailments! How can I have oral thrush for 5 months and be unable to get rid of this, plus all the rest! I am worried that my tests were still too early.Thanks for looking",
