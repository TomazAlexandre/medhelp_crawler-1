    "question": "Hi, I had a baby in 2010. My little man stopped nursing early on so I started pumping milk to feed him.\u00a0\u00a0When my little man was about 4 months old I had the pleasant experience of battling yeast on my breast. They itched and were sore almost the entire time I pumped for my little man. The yeast infection never went away with meds or creams. I was checked for diabetes because that is a sign of diabetes but the doctor told me that if anything my sugar was low and it wasn\u2019t the cause of the yeast growing. When my little man was about 6 months old a lump came up and not long after I pumped blood in the milk a few times. I thought it was because of my nipples being sore. When my little man was about 18 months I had mastitis. When I went in for a yearly pap they were going to schedule me for a mammogram but didn\u2019t because I was pumping. They said that the results wouldn\u2019t have been accurate to determine what the lump was because of producing milk. I stopped pumping when my little man was 20 or 21 months. Even though I am not battling yeast I still have dry and pealing nipples and the lump is still there. It doesn\u2019t hurt but it is there. Now I have noticed that my nipples are flat on one side and further out from the breast on the other. Can these be signs of breast cancer or are they just nursing related issues?\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and years ago I had a swollen lymph-node under my armpit but it eventually went away. I don\u2019t know if that has any relevance.",
