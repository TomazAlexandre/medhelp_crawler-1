            "answer": "Yes thats true. Sometimes blood sugars go up with exercise, especially after strenous exercise. This may happen because you are excited and are releasing a hormone called adrenaline. This is a normal response in people with or without diabetes. The adrenaline causes sugar to be released from stores in the muscle and liver and raises the blood sugar for awhile. This usually happens in the first hour of exercise an later the blood glucose lowers after prolonged exercise.",
