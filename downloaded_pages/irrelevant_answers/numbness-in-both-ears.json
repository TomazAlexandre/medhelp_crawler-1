            "answer": "Hi, I am an RN. Hmmm, I wouldnt be too concerned yet as I once had the same problem. I woke up once and could not hear out of my right ear nor feel the jaw line or ear of the right side of my face! I panicked! I turned out, as I had just gotten out of a long treatment process for anorexia, where stranegly enough you weren't alloud to have Q-tips, that I had a wax plug. The urgent car flushed my ear out and I could not believe the size of that thing! I think they have over the counter kits at the pharmacy. But certainly, if the problem does not go away, consult a physician, and certainly don't put anything in your ear to get anything out.",

    "question": "I am not sure if this is the right forum and topic for this question but I was told to put in on this site.I have had numbness in both my ears for several months. It comes and goes throughout the day and nothing I do can either prevent it or stop it. The numbness starts at the front of my ear at the jawline and into the ear. It feels like someone is blowing a balloon in my ear. It isn't painful but very irritating. I saw my family doctor two days ago and he basically just shrugged his shoulders. He offered to send me to an ENT specialist but didn't figure it would help.I googled it before I saw him and it mentioned diabetes and/'or peripheral neuropathy as possible causes. He completed dismissed that and I left feeling very frustrated.Does anyone have any idea of what I can do to find an answer or if there isn't anything that can be done.Thanks for having a place like this to ask these kinds of questions.",
