            "answer": "It sounds like you did a good job of staying on top of it. Just be careful of any supplements you use; some are contraindicated for use with diabetic cats.If it recurs, you may want to have a rework done on your kitty's bloodwork. It may be possible you need to adjust his insulin level or diet.Keep in mind the occurance could have actually been unconnected to the diabetes. You have to be very careful in assuming that any symptoms are related to an underlying illness like this. While it is likely that it was a diabetic episode, it's always a safe bet to keep your mind open to other possibilities!",

            "answer": "Sorry it took me so long to reply. I did take Sleepy into the vet, where he checked her general health and sugar level. He said that my son made a good call telling me to NOT give her her next dose of insulin.He thought the condition may have reversed itself, but her blood sugar was still high enough to concern him. However, he did adjust her dose to once daily, and we will follow-up this week. She has been fine every since her check-up.Thanks for the advice; our vet said the same thing about assuming it was due to the diabetes!",

    "question": "I am looking for other cat owners who have experienced hypoglycemic spells with their cats. Tolday my cat was drooling and just not herself. I felt sure that she was on the verge of low blood sugar, so fed her. She didn't eat much, then went to lay down. A little while later she came back and ate almost all of her food, then I gave her her insulin shot. She still wasn't herself, but better than she had been. About a half hour later she came out to the living room and was back to her normal self.I hope we interceded in a timely fashion, and was wondering if anyone else has had these experiences, or has advice on early detection and intervention.Thanks,Shelby657",
