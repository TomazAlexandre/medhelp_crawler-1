Just to let you know I found out I found out I had diabetes type 2 shortly before I started tx for hep c. It seems that the two issues are releated cause and effect because I am not Predisposed for diabetes not overweight no family history and so on. The good news is the diabetes is pretty easy, so far, to deal with. A little change in diet and popping a couple of pills a day. Pills that don",

            "answer": "Sorry to hear of your troubles, that's insult to injury for sure. If it's any consolation to you, my dad came down with type II diabetes in his mid 50's and since that time he's been managing it perfectly without drugs. He totally revamped his diet (with alot of help from his wife), and strictly exercises by going on long walks and even riding a bike (my dad hadn't ridden a bike since he was a kid previously) every single day, usually twice a day (he's retired so he has plenty of time to do so). Anyway, it's worked out great for him. It was tough to change his ways at first, but he adapted and now prefers the healthy food and doesn't even like the overly salty, sugary, fatty foods he used to crave. Plus he lost weight, he looks better, he feels much better, his cholesterol and blood pressure are much better. Strangely, the diabetes crisis has resulted in him improving his entire health profile dramatically, and he doesn't take any drugs to achieve it either (my dad's a former undercover narcotics agent lol). His doctor told him on a recent visit that if he didn't already know he had diabetes, he would never be able to tell from his bloodwork or physical workup that he has it at all now.Anyway, not trying to give you the lemondade out of lemons lecture. But depending on how you handle the situation, it can actually work out pretty good if you're willing to put in some dedicated effort (and you seem like the sensible type of person who would). Hope it works out for you.",
