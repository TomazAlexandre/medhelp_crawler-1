            "answer": "Thank you so much for your response. I agree that I need doctors that understand TBI/PCS, but the problem is that no one is listening to me. When I had my EEG done. The tech rolled up a towel under my head and neck. Then within a few minutes, I began to feel a headache, my left upper arm started spasming, left hand went completely numb, and the right hand started involuntarily curling up. In additin to the pain in the neck area connecting to the head. Again, this seems to be a neck issue causing neurological issues. I see the Orthopedic tomarrow. I hope he finally listens and brings good news. I pray that I can get off of these antieplileptic drugs that make me feel worse than without them. All they do is make the headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, and ringing in the ears worse.",

    "question": "A little over 2 moths ago, I had a bad slip and fall during some severe winter weather. When I fell, I had struck the back of my head (left side) with loss of conscieness. I had been very confused, disoriented, feeling of neausea, coordination issues, and barely knew my own name. Since the fall, I have experienced facial spasms, bad headaches, left eye pain, memory problems, dizziness, confusion, and neck pain located at the top of my neck. The original doctor that has seen me took an x-ray of the neck and found an abnormality of the C-1 vertabrae, extending forward unnaturally. This prompted the doctor to have me transported to a local trauma center by ambulance. A CT scan was done with no abnormalites. A MRI was later conducted with results stating that everything was esentailly normal. THe noted issues was reversed lordosis of the C-1/C-2 vertabrae, narrowing of the foramina, and disc degenerative disease of C-6/C-7, C-7/T-1. An EEG was conducted, the result was abnormal awake/asleep for partial seziure disorder of the left side of the brain. The side that struck the icy pavement in the accident. I have had physical therapy for my neck pain that is not helping, but actually in some ways making it worse. I have been put on Pamelor first for the headaches. I had even worse dizziness and raised blood sugar levels to excessive levels. Then put on Depakote and could not tolerate that well either. Now I am on Lamictal and not doing to well with this either. In addition, I have been prescribed Vicoden for the headaches on Lamictal. I have never had or ever diagnosed with epilepsy, and only recently diagnosed as a Type II Diabetic (June 2010). I have been told by my Endocrinologist that I am extremely healthy for a Diabetic. He scatches his head at the blood work, because everything is in the levels of a 20 year old athlete, only exception is blood sugar.Here are my main questions for anyone that can help guide me in a positive direction of healing. Before the fall, the only medication that I took was Metformin for Type II Diabetes and was getting ready to come off of of it. Now I am making my local pharmacy very happy and wealthy. The various medications that keep being prescribed that do not work and having to add more diabetes medications to the mix. In addition, I am a couple steps away from being on insulin only. My goal was to get off of the diabetes medication, not stay on it.If I cannot tolerate antidepressant and antiepileptic medications for headaches and given narcotic pain medication. Does this not mean that maybe this is not the issue? Maybe more attentention should be directed at my neck?Physical therapy makes the neck pain worse and not better. This also makes my head and other symptoms worse. Again does this not warrant more investigation?I feel as though I am being ignored and just told to take a medication that makes me feel worse that I already had. If anyone knows of a better path to take to recovery form this injury. I would greatly appreciate the advice.",
