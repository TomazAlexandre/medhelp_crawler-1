            "answer": "\"My question is...is it possible that he may never have developed diabetes in his life had he not taken the steroids, or would he probably have developed diabetes anyway, but the steroids brought it on earlier in life?\"Blame it on the steroids. Would he develop diabetes anyway? A \"what if\" is difficult if not impossible to answer. A lot would depend on his past lifestyle, foods & liquids consumed, weight, past family history, etc.",

            "answer": "Yes, you can develop type ii diabetes from steroid use. It is possible that the diabetes, if caused by steroid use, can be reversed if the steroids are discontinued. Steroids cause all sorts of endocrine problems. I was taking inhaled steroids for emphysema and it totally messed up my adrenals. I suffered extreme adrenal fatigue and have not\u00a0\u00a0recovered yet, even though I stopped taking the poison several months ago. Likewise my doctor did not monitor my condition and I had to go to someone more interested in his patients to get proper diagnosis and treatment. The big joke is that the first doctor was a pulmonologist and the second one, the one who diagnosed the problem, was a JP. Of course, I would not have been treated at all if I had not suspected what had happened. In a sense I diagnosed myself. Why am I paying all these MD's, if I have to be my own doctor?",

            "answer": "This is interesting as whilst I have an hereditary factor, I have wondered if meds I have taken could have triggered off the high blood sugar,/pre diabetes. Is it only steroids that can be a developing factor what about ante biotics , and anti histimines like Hydroxyzine ,which I was prescribed for hives.",

    "question": "My brother developed type 2 diabetes in his early 50's after being on steroids for years for ulcerative colitis and having a doctor who did not monitor him.\u00a0\u00a0He was having symptoms for quite some time (constantly thirsty and frequent urination), but the doctor told him that he was just experiencing side effects from the steroids.\u00a0\u00a0He ended up in the hospital with extremely high blood glucose.\u00a0\u00a0My question is...is it possible that he may never have developed diabetes in his life had he not taken the steroids, or would he probably have developed diabetes anyway, but the steroids brought it on earlier in life?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
