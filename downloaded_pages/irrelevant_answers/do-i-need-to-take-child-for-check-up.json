            "answer": "Dear lolamc,Thank you for contacting our forum.I am not a doctor but a volunteer for JDRF. Having said that, whether a person is a child or adult with diabetes, the blood sugars should be maintained at the same levels. The numbers seem high. Are you seeing any symptoms such as excessive thirst, weightloss or frequent urination? These can be symptoms of Type 1 diabetes.I would recommend that he or she be taken to her physician for testing as soon as possible. It is important to be diagnosed sooner than later and if the test is negative will give you piece of mind.Please let us know what you find out and I wish you and your grandchild the very best of luck.Best Wishes,dm",
