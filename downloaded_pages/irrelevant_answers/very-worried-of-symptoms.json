            "answer": "First and most important, your test results prove that neither you nor your wife have HIV.\u00a0\u00a0Second, symptoms NEVER are a reliable indicator for or against early HIV infection.\u00a0\u00a0In any case, oral yeast infections occur from time to time in totally healthy people (had it myself once).There are no data to calculate the increase in risk from a single exposure with a penile lesion like you describe. (Which, by the way, sounds like genital herpes--by far the most likely cause of a lesion of the sort your describe.)\u00a0\u00a0The main issue is that receiving fellatio is low risk no matter what.Follow your own provider's advice about a 3 month HIV test, but I don't think it is necessary--unless you need the additional reassurance of one more negative test.\u00a0\u00a0And ask him/her about whether you need a blood test to check for HSV infection.Best wishes--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

    "question": "Dr.,I know that we can not go by symptoms but alot of strange things have happened on a time frame consistent with ARS. Let me briefly walk you through the timetableApr 12th Possible exposure (insertive oral with lesion on penis)Apr 17th Unprotected sex with wifeApr 24th-28th Fatigue, diarrea,nausea, hand swelling & peeling, joint pain.May 14th Wife develops Oral thrush with sore lymph node behind ear and slightly sore throat, (diagnosed by Dr.)\u00a0\u00a0(she had no\u00a0\u00a0idea that I had possible exposure)Thrush goes away in 2 days with medicine.May 15th I freak out and have 33-day Orasure Oral test negative.May 17th I tell her of possible exposure and I get 35-day negative Elisa and negative P-24 antigen test.\u00a0\u00a0She gets a 30-day negative oral testMay 22nd She gets a 35 day\u00a0\u00a0negative Elisa test, along with complete blood work that shows no issues on any account.We have each had an additional Oral test since then that is negative. (6 weeks for me, 6 weeks for her)Here are my questions:What are other causes of Thrush? (Diabetes,antibiotics, steroids have all been ruled out)Could my wife have experienced thrush only 3 weeks after exposure and if so would she have had other symptoms?Would her blood work come back normal if HIV was present? IE would there have been abnormal white blood cells etc..?How much risk does a lesion on penis (friction abrasion, looked like blister after broken)add to this equation.Do we need additional testing at 3 months ?I feel like i am worrying about something for nothing but the order of these events is very concerning to me.Thanks",
