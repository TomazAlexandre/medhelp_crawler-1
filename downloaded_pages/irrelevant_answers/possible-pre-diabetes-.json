            "answer": "Sweet smelling urine is an indication of Ketones, or excessive sugar in the blood stream. Testing at home is good but one must be sure the meter used is calibrated properly, instructions usually found in the owners/user guide that accompanied the meter. Best testing times are fasting - nothing to eat and no colored liquids for 8-10 hrs - and 2-3 hours after a meal. Fasting will provide a baseline measurement, after meal testing to see how the foods you ate affect your blood glucose [sugar].Since diabetes runs in your family it is in your best interest to follow diabetes guidelines; maintain proper weight, exercise daily, and refrain from eating sugar laden foods, and high carbohydrate foods. Get properly tested at your doctors to see where you stand.",

            "answer": "Excellent advice. The only thing I would add is that fasting blood sugars over 100 are indicative of pre-diabetes, but if you have had coffee with cream than it is not fasting. You should ask your doctor for an A1C which is now the diagnostic test for pre-diabetes and diabetes.",

            "answer": "Postprandial [after meal] goal is <141 mg/dl, the optimal range is <121 mg/dl. At 129 mg/dl your results were very very good.But again, since T2 diabetes runs in the family it's in your best interest to get an A1c. If that turns out OK, then retest in 3 years or as your doctor wishes. Good luck.",
