            "answer": "Could be many things, such as a big baby, a different position. It's not inches by the way its cm's. They do a u/s usually to measure the baby and see if he/she is bigger than they are supposed to be. I have gestational diabetes and I'm 34wks and my belly measures 41. At my 31wk growth u/s my baby weighed in at 5lb 2 oz! So go figure.",

    "question": "Hi,My name is Brooke and this is my 2nd pregnancy. My first was a joke looking back on it now...I had no problems!!!! With this prgnancy it is one thing after another. I had a girl with y first one and now I am having a boy. Well my question is....I went to a 30 week check up andthey mesured my belly at 30inches, I just had my 31 week normal check up and she messured me at 34inches. She is sending me for an ultrasound next week. What does that mean that my baby will be big or that he is coming sooner?Thanks Brooke",
