            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is possible to feel tremors all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, poor sleep patterns, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Certain epilepsies too could be the cause. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You will need blood sugar monitoring, MRI of brain and cervical spine, T3, T4, TSH, sleep studies, serum electrolytes, brain EEG, etc to reach a diagnosis. Some of these causes have been evaluated. The others need to be looked at. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi all,I'm having some issues go figure. I've been to see a few doctors. This all started about 10 months ago with me having tremors. I went to my family doctor who ran a few blood test everything came out negative so he sent me to have an MRI with contrast and referred me to a neurologist. The neurologist states my MRI looks great, so he ran an EEG which came back fine and then a ambulatory EEG. Since this I've had multiple issues stemming from this and all listed here. Tremors, memory loss, insomnia, disorientation, dizziness/balance issues, double vision, and it's hard to explain when I'm having these issues it seems like I've got something going on with my hearing. If I had to explain it I can hear everything just fine, just not process it. After all of these test went down I ended up having what the EMT's stated was a seizure, and that I was clonic tonic after. The neurologist since has referred me to a psychiatrist to check for psychosomatic seizures. The psychiatrist is stating that this is not the issue, and he thinks it's neurological and referred me back to my neurologist. I'm on Keppra 750mg twice daily which has helped with the tremors it seems but I'm still having problems with my memory, and Trileptal 150mg in the morning and 300mg at night. I've always been known for having a good memory, never had to study, always remembered numbers and what people told me very easily. Now I'm having fits where I don't know where I am, who I am, and in one case who my son was. I really don't know what to do at this point as my job fired me while I was on short term disability because they denied and I'm appealing because both of the doctors are saying in their specialty I'm fine, but that they know something is wrong. It feels like who I am is just slipping away into a vegetable at times. My ex co-workers said that when I was having the \"seizure\" that I was holding onto anything I could, which I find the urge to do at times, and that they could see some tears rolling down the side of my face. I'm 25 years old, I'm a little overweight about 5ft 6in. 280lbs, but at my fittest(I used to be a physical training commander for my JROTC unit) I was about 5ft 6in. 165lbs in great shape. I've been tested for high blood pressure, diabetes, and all of the \"fat person\" issues or diseases ( As my neurologist calls them) and they've all come back negative. Any ideas?",
