            "answer": "This is my problem, I could not swollow-this happened in the middle of the night, I woke up, because I was trying to swollow, ( like seliva) in my sleep, and couold not swollow.\u00a0\u00a0It took some time before I discoverd that if I moved my lower jaw and tongue, that eventually I could again swollow- this feels like my muscles in the throat will not respond- I was checked by 3 doctors who did not find anything, and I think did not believe me- 18 months later, I chose to go to a new doctor for my diabetes, and right away found a large nodule on the left side of the thyroid- after tests it proved to be 1.49cm- I was told this is pretty large, I have just gotten the results of the biopsy, and it is not (Thank Goodness) Cancer, as I am a 2 time cancer survivor, I was really prepared for the worst.\u00a0\u00a0What happens next is up to the doc.\u00a0\u00a0But it is getting harder to swollow, and the pressure in the ears is unbelieveable-I am so very sorry that you have no insurance- I was hoping that the health care reform that did pass would have something to help all of us ?",

    "question": "Left side of my neck has been swollen for a week. Not real obvious--but it is obvious to touch. Reminds me of thyroid goiter.Except I had two radioactive iodine treatments (first one didn't take) after a one-year bout with Graves disease. Tried to treat that w/ meds for a year. Didn''t work. Had a large goiter right side--when the one on the left appeared dr. thought it could be cancer. So she ordered me to stop meds and go get iodine thing. On about 175 of levothyroid for 15 yrs. I don't have insurance--thanks to wonderful economy. I don't know if I'm being hypochondriac",
