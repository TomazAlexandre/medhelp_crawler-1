            "answer": "She could go into insulin shock, and need immediate medical attention. It can cause all sorts of problems including brain damage. The best thing to do is to give her orange juice when that happens. They also sell glucose tablets at Wal-Mart that work well. I'm sure there are other things to do, but I'm not that well-knowledged about diabetes type 1 yet. My hubby has it.",

            "answer": "If your wife is experiencing frequent lows then she probably needs an adjustment in her medication. Is she on insulin? Basal/bolus? How does she determine her bolus dose? Does she have a set dose? If so, it may be too high for the amount of carbs she is eating; an Insulin/Carb ratio is much safer. When does she take her basal (long acting) insulin? If she takes it at bedtime, then that may be too high a dose that is making her blood sugar so low in the early morning. Many people are able to treat their hypoglycemia down into the 30s, but much lower than that and they could lose consciousness. It is not safe to try and get someone to swallow something if they are unconscious, but they will need a glucogon injection or to call 911. Much better than risk dangerous hypos is to find out what is causing them to begin with. It is usually too much insulin or a combination of too much insulin and too little food (carbs).Zoe",

            "answer": "It's not good to go low like that every day; you need to talk to her doctor and get her does changed. A set dose of mealtime insulin (bolus) is not standard of care and also is not safe because we don't eat the same amount of carbs daily. I really recommend the book Using Insulin by John Walsh as it explains everything in a really clear manner. However for starters she needs to learn to know how many carbs she is eating. Packaged foods list carbs on the labels; for other foods there are lists online like CalorieKing.com. An average insulin/carb ratio is 1 unit of insulin for every 15 carbs, but this is only an average, we are all different in terms of our insulin needs. 10 units sounds very high, what are her numbers 2 hours after eating? What you can do to determine HER I:C ratio is start from 1:15 and see how that turns out two hours after eating, then adjust it up or down. Many of us have different ratios for different meals. Mine for instance is 1:10, 1:12 and 1:17. It sounds complicated but after a week of counting carbs and testing it starts to come clear. Her Lantus level might also be high, if you cut it back by a unit or two and then see a couple days how her morning numbers go, you might get good results. If your doctor is not responsive, many of us have to educate ourselves. I also suggest two boards with lots more information: TuDiabetes.com and Diabetesforums.com",

            "answer": "I agree with what others are saying.\u00a0\u00a0Your wife needs to adjust her bedtime shot and I personally always check my sugar before giving my bedtime shot and will sometimes adjust my Lantus accordingly.\u00a0\u00a0Worsecase for myself, I would rather be high in the night and then take a fast acting insulin in the early morning (4am/5am) so that when I eat at around 8-9am my sugar is fine.If she is low in the am she is taking too much insulin either at supper and is her sugar is not high enough at bedtime or she needs less Lantus.I do not feel my low sugars so I always run a bit high to be safe.lLastly, you should not try to give liquids to your wife is she is unconscious.\u00a0\u00a0CALL 911 and keep a Glucagon kit in your home.Good luck,Jodips...speak to your wife's doctor before making any changes but do so ASAP",

            "answer": "Your wife's handling of her diabetes is dangerous in so many ways. She absolutely needs to check before each meal because that is how she determines the correct dose, as well as know the carbs she is about to eat. If she \"feels\" her sugar is high, she takes a shot of fast acting insulin???? When? After she eats? This is called a correction shot and the correct dose (correction factor) needs to be figured out in order to know how many units will drop her blood sugar by how far. It is not a surprise that she is experiencing both highs and lows frequently if she is managing her diabetes this way.You might want to find out WHY she doesn't want to monitor her health. Is she thinking that if she ignores it, it will go away? It won't; she will end up in the hospital, in a diabetic coma or with serious complications. She is a lovely young woman with, obviously a loving husband, and she deserves better! By your description of her sleep patterns and her not caring about her diabetes, I'm wondering if she is suffering from Depression. Depression is 3 times more common in people suffering from Diabetes. If she is suffering from Depression it probably won't just go away on its own. When you see the doctor I would mention this to him and see if he can refer her to someone to talk to and perhaps prescribe medication if it is warrented.",

            "answer": "as a type 1 diabetic for almost 10 years now, i was like your wife. i didn't care about checking my b/s levels for just about the whole time i've been a diabetic until last year when my blood average was 350 with a1c of 10.9-11.4. i decided that i did not want to die before i turned 40(i'm 36)! yes it is a pain in the *** to test as many times a day as recomended and yes it does get expensive, but ask her this, is it worth her life and the grief that you and other loved ones will go through when this could have been prevented? also say to her that testing only takes 5-30 sec of her day (depending on the type of tester). the agnozing death of constant high blood sugars is not something any one should go through. hope this helps.dtxpress74",
