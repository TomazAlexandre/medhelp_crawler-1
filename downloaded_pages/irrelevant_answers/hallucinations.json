    "question": "My mother has gone from Parkinsons to Parkinsonism after receiving Zyprexa and now dementia at 87 years of age. She receives 15 mg of zyprexa at noon with sinemet and Tylenol 3. Doesn't the codeine intensify the sinemet and cause stronger hallucinations?Does Zyprexa ever cause hallucinations? Did the Zyprexa cause Parkinsonism? Does the codeine cause permanent damage to the brain and cause dementia? She has type 2 diabetes as well as cardio issues. Thanks for answering these questions as all this seems to be a\u00a0\u00a0circle of confusion to me. Irene M.",
