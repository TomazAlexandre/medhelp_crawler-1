            "answer": "Hi, what is Angus Castus!?! What is it supposed to help do!?! I have never been diagnosed with PCOS but I have gone 13 months before without a cycle!! So I feel exactly where u are right now. I've been on Clomid several times. Fist few times 50 mg while my Ob kept pushing that it could be my weight, as I am overweight.... So I had lost 25lbs and Ob upped me to 100mg and BAMM pregnant on the 1st round. Unfortunately we lost our lil joy ay 7wks. Oh and I was also given Provera to help regulate my cycles. Maybe as ur Dr/Ob about Metformin, it was used also in my treatment of infertility....I wish u super sticky baby dust!!!!! Good luck and be on the look out for your 2015 blessing :-)",

            "answer": "Hey, I have been diagnosed with pcos and diabetes.... I haven't had a bleed for 10 years up until 4 days ago and still bleeding ... I was taken to hospital the first day I started bleeding cause I was in severe pain. I saw a infertility specialist and he sat beside my bed saying that women with pcos can concierge jyst as naturally as other women... And the reason why my period came back was due to the fact I lost 17 kgs and am on 1000mgs of metformin a day for my diabetes. I had adopted a whole new lifestyle and obviously is working out for me.... Just be patient and treat your body well and I'm sure it will happen for you. The best if luck for you both xx",
