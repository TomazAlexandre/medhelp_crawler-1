            "answer": "I drank pop throughout two of my pregnancies and both my boys are healthy kids. This is my third and I've been drinking pop again. I'd say one to two cans a day..unless you have DB I wouldn't worry about it. There's not that much caffeine in pop compared to coffee, but if you're concerned it says on the can/bottle how much caffeine there is in a serving.",

            "answer": "It all depends on what else you are drinking to stay hydrated & how much caffeine you take in. If you are drinking only soda, or also have a cup or two of coffee in the morning, that's not a good thing for three reasons. Firstly, the high caffeine intake isn't very good for baby and secondly, it is much easier to become dehydrated because you have to drink so much more water to compensate for the caffeine, sugar & chemicals. Lastly, soda is very high in sugar & has zero nutritional value. Its all empty calories & simple sugars that can contribute to gestational diabetes. The best rule of thumb is everything in moderation.",

            "answer": "I guess it would be very hard if you drank it all the time. You want to have the most nutrition for your child. Granted, I still eat cookies and junk but I try to only have small portions and only when cravings get bad. Maybe share a soda with your partner when you want one so you don't have as much?",

But if I don't drank mine I will have the worset headache ever and start throwing up which ain't good for the baby.. So with that said most doctors will tell u dranknany fluids that u can hold down",

            "answer": "I use to drink lots of juice and pop. But since I'm pregnant I have lost interest in both. I mostly drink water. If I don't drink at least three 16oz bottles in my 8 hr work shift I feel thirsty. The sugar in juice and soda is not good for some people who may be pre-diabetic. I will say I have lost weight (15lbs) instead of gaining so far and I'm at 14 weeks.",
