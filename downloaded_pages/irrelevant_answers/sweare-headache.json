            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Was a MRI of upper cervical spine done? It could be nerve compression there. It can also be due to seborrhagic dermatitis. Endocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and glucose control disorders (diabetes and hypoglycemia both) all result in increased sweating. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating. It can also be due to low blood pressure. Ask her to get thyroid and adrenal gland function tested.Hope these tips help. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
