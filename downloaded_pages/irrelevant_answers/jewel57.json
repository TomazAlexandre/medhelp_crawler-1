            "answer": "are you having any symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Your levels would point to possibly hypothyroid (TSH is a little bit high, not too bad though), high antibodies would be hashimoto's.The specialist they're referring to is probably an endocrinologist, they specialize in thyroid, as well as metabolic and diabetes disorders.good luck!betsy",

            "answer": "Looks like it could be Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (also called autoimmune or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis) is the most common type of thyroiditis.Thyroiditis is an inflammation (not an infection) of the thyroid gland. Several types of thyroiditis exist and the treatment is different for each.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor might have other test done to see which you have.However, Hashimoto's Thyroiditis is a type of autoimmune thyroid disease in which the immune system attacks and destroys the thyroid gland.\u00a0\u00a0Hashimoto\u2019s prevents the gland from producing enough thyroid hormones for the body to work correctly. It is the most common form of Hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid). It is a progressive disease of the thyroid that will eventually destroy the thyroid gland and cause a lack of thyroid hormone (hypothyroidism).Depending on you situation and family history, doctor might find it warranted to put you on thyroid hormones to get your thyroid level to normal.\u00a0\u00a0This will require thyroid testing on a regular bases, because as the thyroid dies off (little bit at a time) your med. dose will required adjustment.Hope this explains a little - good luck!",

            "answer": "Your thyroid controls all of your body in some fashion.Your memory can be affected, but may be temporary.Thyroid disease can affect your moods, making you depressed, anxious, cranky, or cry-at-the-drop-of-a-hat.It is a serious illness and should not be ignored.It can affect your heart.It can affect your eyes.It can affect your bones and any of your organs.Much like Diabetes, how much damage it does to your body is controlled by how well you manage the disease. Do everything you're supposed to, and it is managable. Do everything you are NOT supposed to do, and you will invite trouble.When your thyroid dies you take a pill a day. The jury is out on whether you will ever feel \"great\" again.It's not as bad as Cancer. Several people on this board are dealing with that as well.As hard as it may sound, don't worry about too much until you have a diagnosis. Don't dally around getting a diagnosis. If you are told the soonest appointment is three months away, tell them you cannot, and will not wait that long.Don't take the first diagnosis as set in stone, either. Mistakes happen.",
