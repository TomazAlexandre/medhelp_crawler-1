            "answer": "Hi there. The causes of excessive sweating are overactive thyroid gland, gout, rheumatoid arthritis, hypoglycemia, metabolic dysfunction, nerve damage due to diabetes, panic and anxiety states, etc. you had weakness and tightness of muscles and inability to speak. This could be a generalized tonic clonic seizure with the aura and post ictal phase. This also needs transient ischemic attack or mini stroke due to brief cessation of blood supply to the brain due to a blood clot, embolus or vascular spasm. Consult a neurologist who would do a detailed systemic examination and investigations like MRI brain, ultrasound neck, and echocardiogram heart. An electroencephalogram to check for seizure activity is also indicated. Take care.",

    "question": "I woke up in the middle of the night a few nights ago with abdominal pain. When I got out of bed I noticed I felt very weak and strange. I went to the restroom and as I sat there I began to sweat excessively to the point where my pajamas and body were completely soaked as though I had just got out of the shower. I began to feel weaker and barely was able to shout for my husband. when he came in I was on the floor and my body felt tight . My hands got stiff and in a strange position with my thumbs turned inward. I had no abilty to straighten them. although it felt like an eternity I think it lasted only a few minutes. The next day I felt completely drained, tired and unproductive. I had the exact same situation about 2yrs ago....only difference is that I also had stiffness and uncontrolled movement in my face as well. I have not been ill with a cold or flu for a very long time.",
