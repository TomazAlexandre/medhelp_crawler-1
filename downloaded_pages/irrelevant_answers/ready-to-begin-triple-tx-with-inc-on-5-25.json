            "answer": "I suggest having the following items on hand when a person starts treatment but be sure to check with your treating doctor before taking them. There may be some reason Gary's doc does not want him to take certain meds, even over the counter meds.Tylenol (I use 325 mg)\u00a0\u00a0for headache and general muscle achesBenadryl caps for the rash and itchingPreparation H suppositoriesPreparation H hemorrhoid creamLoperimide tabs for the diarrheaHuggies baby wipes with aloe (to keep the buttocks extra clean)Hydrocortisone cream for the rashGel type cold pack (this comes in handy for headaches and itching)Toilet paper, lots of it, LOL.Hypoallergenic lotion or very mild unscented lotionIf he gets a bad rash the benadryl and the over the counter hydrocortisone cream are probably not going to work very well. (They worked for me when I had a bump here and there, but once I really got a rash, they did nothing.)I found Hydroxyzine 50 mg every 6 hours to work wonders. It is the only thing that really cleared up the rash and the itching and keeps it controlled. I also used fluocinonide ointment which will work locally, but the rash is caused by a systemic drug reaction so the rash just moves to another spot.\u00a0\u00a0I also used clobetesol soln (for the scalp rash).Best of luck to both of you.",

    "question": "I posted this to a previous link I had, but I was not sure if would come up as a new post, so I decided to re-post here.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry if this was\u00a0\u00a0not the correct way to do this . . .Well, we found a doctor at the University of Arizona Medical Center in Tucson that was willing to try triple tx with Inc for Gary.\u00a0\u00a0It took all of 5 weeks to get the drugs prescribed and prior auth approved through Medicare.\u00a0\u00a0We received the medications for treatment yesterday . . . a very expensive package!\u00a0\u00a0But we got it!\u00a0\u00a0So at a milestone . . . Gary has been feeling stronger, even though his platelets are still low 80, all other counts have gained to either normal low or normal.\u00a0\u00a0So I guess he is about as healthy as he can be for the beginning of this tx.\u00a0\u00a0He has prepped his skin with lots of lotion over the past week and he continues to drink lots of water.\u00a0\u00a0We registered with the support nurse program through Incivek and with the medicine package we also got some starter kit stuff.\u00a0\u00a0I think we are ready to begin.\u00a0\u00a0The 20g of fat diet we are working on and I am thinking that if I try to keep his diet high in fiber, maybe the diarrhea and irritated hinny may not be so bad . . . but I am going to have on had the supplies that may help.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed the medication Zofran for nausea.\u00a0\u00a0At our appointment on Friday, I plan to ask about that.Are there any other items besides baby wipes with Aloe, that anyone suggests we ask for a prescription of or pick up ahead of time?We have also found a new pcp here in Tucson as our pcp back in Vermont is finding it difficult to help Gary while he is here.\u00a0\u00a0We are also meeting with an endocrinologist in two weeks to help Gary with his diabetes. In fact, the pcp we have now here in Tucson is suggesting an insulin pump for Gary.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if we could take on something new and complicated the 2nd week into tx.\u00a0\u00a0We will see....I just wish I had a crystal ball to tell us if this the choice to dive into the triple tx is worth the risks.\u00a0\u00a0Even with 135 dose of peg- and 800 mg of ribo, his blood counts were so low, he needed neopogen and procrit . . . I am worried, but I am ready.\u00a0\u00a0He is ready too, and he wants to \"go for it\", so we are off and running . . .I haven't posted much lately but I do read lots of your posts.\u00a0\u00a0You are all a big inspiration to many with out even realizing it!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks to every one of you for sharing your stories, giving advice, support and suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0It REALLY helps!!PEACE~HOPE~TRUSTAllison",
