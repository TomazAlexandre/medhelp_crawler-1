            "answer": "Oh..my only fear is checking the blood sugar 4 times a day! :( i really really hope that my OB gyn doesnt ask me to do that!! Diet and excercise are managable things.@Sunshine33107: did you consult a nutritionist and get your meal plan? Also is your baby meassuring big or you are losing weight due to GD?",

            "answer": "My OB has had no involvement in my GD treatment.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I failed they sent me to the hospital where I had to meet with the team from the Perinatal Center. I was terrified to stick my fingers! I have no problem with needles in my arms for blood draws but the thought of constantly pricking my fingers just made me freak out. Honestly it's not as bad as I thought. I met with an amazing dietitian who specializes in diabetes and she explained everything that was happening to my body & the baby. At my last ultrasound he was measuring about a week & a half early. I am still below my pre-pregnancy weight. I lose the weight in like 7-12lbs chunks then gain back maybe 3lbs then lose more & back & forth. None of the doctors seem to be concerned about it, so I guess its somewhat normal lol I was diagnosed with GD about 3 weeks ago so im still new to a lot of this.",

            "answer": "I had GD with my first pregnacy @30 weeks. And I've been dealing with GD since my 14th week (now 30).Your body is in overdrive and is just over making for your baby, and your baby is kicking back your sugars he don't need.I have to take insulin. Every night and now I'm going to have to take it more since we're in the end stage and my body is kicking it up a notch now by over produceing sugars.I recomend not pricking your fingers, do your arm. It doesn't hurt at all.I do my insulin in my thighs. Since it's hard to do my side now.Honestly the eating is the worse part. I have no disire to eat. But I force myself to maintain my levels. It's just portion control and eating more frequently.I wish you luck! And I promise it's not as bad as it seems.",

    "question": "Jut got to know that i failed the 3 hrs test. 2 out of the 4 blood tests had a higher value than the cutoff.Fasting - 74 (normal range is 65 to 95)1 hr - failed by 7 points2 hrs - failed by 11 points3 hrs - well below the cutoffI am worried if i would need prick myself everyday to test my sugar levels? :( That doesnt sound fun at all!! Diabetes never ran in my family and i dont like having sweet things at all! So far i had no complaints about my pregnancy. But looks like the 3 rd trimester isnt going to be that cool!Any suggestions/experience sharing would be very very helpful!",
