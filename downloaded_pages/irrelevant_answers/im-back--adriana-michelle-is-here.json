    "question": "Hey all, sorry it took me so long to update.\u00a0\u00a0So, I went in at 6:00am Wednesday morning, and Adriana Michelle was born via c-section\u00a0\u00a0at 8:55am.\u00a0\u00a0She was 7lbs 13oz, and 19 in long.\u00a0\u00a0She is the ONLY baby out of the three that was breathing and crying as soon as she came out.\u00a0\u00a0it was the best sound ever.\u00a0\u00a0My c-section\u00a0\u00a0this time was a bit rough.\u00a0\u00a0They didn't let my husband in during the spinal, which I didn't like.\u00a0\u00a0Also, they gave me a shot of ephedrine before my surgery so my blood pressure wouldn't drop, but my heart was beating so fast, the feeling was horrible.\u00a0\u00a0it seems that I had almost every bad reaction to the spinal.\u00a0\u00a0Within minutes I was throwing up, then shaking, then itching...and the shaking and itching continued for quite some time after.,.but that was oik, it was def. worth it.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors had commended me on how well I must have taken care of myself(I had gestational diabetes), because she came out so perfect...perfect weight, perfectly breathing, perfect blood sugars.....I really had expected things to get a little hairy, but nope...I am so happy and she is such a good baby.\u00a0\u00a0She came out with a headfull of dark hair which I WAS NOT expecting.\u00a0\u00a0She looks like me, which is so great.\u00a0\u00a0I am posting some pictures of her after i post this, so everyone go take a look at my little princess.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for all the support!!!",
