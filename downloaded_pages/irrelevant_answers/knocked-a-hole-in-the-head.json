            "answer": "A scab that is formed on the wound generally settles by a week. The best thing you can do is apply a dry medicated antibacterial powder or an antibiotic cream and keep the area dry. Clean the area of the wound daily with an antiseptic solution daily before applying the cream or powder. However do this gently.Avoid head bath for a week. Use a wet warm towel to gently massage the head taking care to stay away from the area. Avoid using comb in the area.Also get your blood sugar checked for diabetes as at times the presence of diabetes delays wound healing.If despite these precautions the scab does not form and the wound does not heal consult a doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "About 2 years ago i was getting something out of a cabinet down below and when i came up i hit my head on the corner of the cabinet.....not hard, but hard enough to where i put pressure on the hurt. 10 hours later when I brush my hair, it hurt badly and i felt something running down the side of my face, it was blood of course....I guess i hit my head hard enough to knock a hole the size of a pea into it......I never went to the hospital for stitches and bout 6 months after the whole had closed up, but now I am dealing with the perimeter, which is refusing to heal - I guess it is because it's just under the hairline and cant heal properly because of washing of the hair.\u00a0\u00a0I have gone the the ER 3 months ago and he gave me some medicine to put on it, but it doesn't seem to be help, he also told me that I might need plastic surgery (As if)...the hole now is about the size of a nickle the center of the wound has healed, but the outside of the wound is still trying to heal - I guess it doesn't help with healing when I wash my hair and get it wet - I have been using Bactine, and it seems to help dry it up...getting scabs...but as soon as I get it wet...back to the beginning....someone had told me to but liquid bandage on it to keep it from getting wet - any suggestions?",
