It is to help releive the external. It has helped me alot. It isnt a \"cure\" or \"treatment\" but it will help with the little \"freak outs\" when it may just be an onset or sthing. Good luck!",

    "question": "Hello guys, i dont know if you all remember me but a short history, i had a horrible rash with bumps and itching and irritation for about 3 months and i would always be freaking out thinking it was herpes and so on. I had gone to planned parenthood and they told me it wasnt a yueast infection but they didnt know what it could be. I finally went to a REAL doctor who by the first minute pf looking at it said it definately looked like\u00a0\u00a0chronic untreated yeast infection and gave me a prescription for a cream that started with the word \"T\" but i dont remember the name. I inserted that for 3 days and it actually felt A LOT better. it has been about a week since that treatment and i was just wondering how long it take for it to completely to heal. I mean i feel good and stuff but i am so traumatized that everytime time i feel just a slight discomfort i start worrying that its coming back. My doctor had told me that with my diabetes, i am very prone t yeast infections and i was wondering what can i do to prevent that if anything at all. Thank you for reading and have a great day!",
