            "answer": "Diabetes is all about (blood glucose) BG numbers.\u00a0\u00a0The Med. community decides where to draw the line.Used to be under 200 was good then they found out people under 200 developed complications.\u00a0\u00a0So the redrew the line at 180 guess what they too developed complications. So it went to 160 for a short time.\u00a0\u00a0We do know from studys and lab work that any BG over 140 causes damage to nerves and capillaries.\u00a0\u00a0Now most diabetics are higher at one hour and drop by hour 2.\u00a0\u00a0I have NO idea why the medical community is so stuck on 2 hours.\u00a0\u00a0the ONLY thing that test will show you is that you have some function left in the pancreas.So many diabetics have a 2 hour that is under 120 but the Peek BG that happens much sooner than 2 hours is much higher than 120.Remember the numbers that the med community spout are just drawn in the sand and can move.\u00a0\u00a0The only number that has any real science behind it that BG over 140 causes damage.",

            "answer": "Hi,I watched a few of Dr Bernstein videos and it pretty much confirms that this is not an exact science. He is basing his theories on what blood sugar levels are in young children, pregnant women and traveling glucose monitor salesmen, and the ADA according to him is basing it on the number of lawsuits resulting in deaths from hypoglycemia.Where is the actual science though?The meter salesmen all had readings of exactly 83 except one who was 66 and admitted to being a bit low? Can this even be taken seriously?",

    "question": "There is a lot of noise on the internet regarding what are the 'Normal Numbers'. I believe oficial ADA numbers are< 100 for fasting, <140 1hr after meal and <120 two or more hours after meal.But then many articles say 'True Normal Numbers' are < 83 fasting and always < 100.What do they mean by 'True Normal Numbers'?Also are these averages or absolute maximums?",
