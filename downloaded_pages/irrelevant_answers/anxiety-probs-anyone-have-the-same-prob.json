            "answer": "I have been getting treated for anxiety/panic disorder for about 5 years now. It's no fun. I tried a ton of different things, including therapy and trying to just \"get over it\" on my own. But I've now been taking medication for about 2 years and it's the best I've felt in awhile. The other times I took medicine and felt better after awhile, I thought I was \"cured\" and quit the medication. I always felt okay for awhile, but it always came back eventually. Medication isn't for everyone, but if you've tried the therapy and every breathing technique and you're still getting the whole \"I'm dying\" feelings, then I would give the medicine a chance. Trust me. I know exactly how you feel. I ended up in the ER numerous times because I just KNEW I was having a heart attack. I seriously thought I was going to suffocate or my heart would stop.Good luck and God Bless! I hope you feel better soon!!!!! I know how it feels!",

            "answer": "One more thing, if you do decide to get on some medication (which I think you should, it's an illness like any other) then you need to talk to your Dr. and tell him that you aer trying to get pregnant. You don't want to end up taking something that could hurt the baby or make it harder to get pregnant.Also, anxiety could make it harder for you to get pregnant.And you should be on prenatal vitimans right now with you ttc. It's important to take them before you get pregnant!!",
