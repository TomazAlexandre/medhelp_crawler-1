            "answer": "It shouldn't be that high ever, unless you have GD or diabetes before pregnancy. I have diabetes diagnosed before pregnancy and my numbers are never that high and I could eat a whole cake. Take it easy and follow orders mama. As for telling you your baby might die, that's a little crazy. However you could be passing on your diabetes to your LO, or they could gain too much weight causing labor and delivery complications. Goodluck and take your two weeks of bedrest to monitor carefully and relax.",

            "answer": "I am 31 weeks I had to start checking mine 5 times a day because I failed the glucose test. Your sugar isn't suppose to be over 120 after two hours of eating a meal. Mine hasn't been over 120 at all since I started checking it. Try to cut out anything high in sugar and carbs. It will help keep your sugar from rising. Bread is really bad for you.",

    "question": "So I came from the hospital yesterday and they said my sugar was high...well duh because you fed me breakfast before you pricked my finger!! It was 274 after breakfast and then maybe 2 hours not even it went to 229 now I have to go see a dietician and have to check every day which is not fair. Cuz last week when They took my blood they never said anything. I hate doctors sometimes. He said if I don't cut back my child Will most likely die or he won't be able to move his arm cuz his shoulders won't fit coming out. But everyone said he's right on time he weighs what he's suppose too I don't eat bad because I didn't want gd and deal with this. I walk on the trail twice a week it's just frustrating how they just do stuff like this. I can get my sugar down no problem it's just why say something now I'm in my last 3 months....and no work for 2 weeks? That's a little overboard but it's what's best for my son so I have to do it. I need guidance ladies!!!",
