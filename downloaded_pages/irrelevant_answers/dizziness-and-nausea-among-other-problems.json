            "answer": "Hello D646,We are volunteers here & not medical professionals, so please do follow up with a medical doctor to review the information & suggestions you get here.Many of your symptoms are consistent with diabetes and so it's important that you talk to your doctor ASAP to be evaluated for that.\u00a0\u00a0Untreated diabetes can lead to premature nasty complications.YOu categorized your posting as \"hypoglycemia\" and dizzy, nausea, sweaty feelings are common symptoms of hypoglycemia aspects of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The frequent urination and weight loss and others are common symptoms of hyperglycemia aspects of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Only a physician can determine, for sure, if you have diabetes, pre-diabetes, or something else altogether.If your current physician was only willing to test you for anemia (are you being treated for that?), then I recommend you choose another physician for a much more complete workup.\u00a0\u00a0Stress alone can create several of the symptoms you report, also.\u00a0\u00a0If you do have diabetes, it will be important to be followed by a physician who SPECIALIZES in its treatment:\u00a0\u00a0either an endocrinologist or a diabetologist.\u00a0\u00a0A general practice physician will not have the depth or breadth of knowledge needed to help you learn to manage the disease.Good luck.\u00a0\u00a0Push past the fear to contact a doctor for a full workup.\u00a0\u00a0You'll relieve a lot of your fear by then being able to focus on managing whatever \"it\" is.",
