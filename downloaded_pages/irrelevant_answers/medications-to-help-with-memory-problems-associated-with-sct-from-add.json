            "answer": "Hi SScalio. Welcome to the forum.How long have you been having these issues?I think I can help you some. .Hashimotos is an extremely difficult condition to treat.Your hypo symptoms may be still lingering, despite taking levothyroxine.When was the last time you had Free T3, Reverse T3 and Free T4levels checked?There's a simple test to do on your own, to gauge the effectiveness of yourlevothyroxine and if you are hypo, as this alone can have a major impact on any organ, any system of your body!Dr.Barnes basal temperature test. Just search for it and follow the instructions to the \"T\". It is very accurate, but it may not be accurate if you have an infection.Has your doctor ever checked your adrenal function?If you have adrenal insufficiency,\u00a0\u00a0Levothyroxine may be making matters much worse for you, as it would be counter indicated, until adrenalfunction is restored.Lovastatin is a statin drug that may have to be well re- evaluated and the risk/benefit assessment has to be done PROPERLY!(High cholesterol is one of the most common symptoms of low thyroid function.)Doctors prescribe these drugs too easily!Do you know what your cholesterol levels were, when you originally tested?People who have diabetes are also in a high risk for diabetes 3\u00a0\u00a0or diabetes of the brain. It's a similar presentation.Provigil comes with a long list of side effects, some of which you may bealready feeling.I also did a drug interaction check for you and you have at least 1 MAJORinteraction, 4 moderate and 1 minor interaction ,using the drugs *******drug interaction checker.Are you treated by different doctors? How is your PCP?Have you ever considered seeing a Naturopathic or Holistic Doctor?There are far too many loose ends and possible discrepancies that I detect.Please post again with your answers and comments.If you prefer you may message me.At this time I'm not suggesting any supplements for memory.And please do not consider any extra meds till\u00a0\u00a0you get everything sorted out first. I will offer you specific suggestions next time.This is not intended as a substitute for medical advice.Best wishes.Love and LightNiko",

            "answer": "Sorry i responded so late, My endocrinologist has been testing my thyroid every three months and says everything is normal, but I don't exactly know the tests she is testing and what she is looking at. She kept me on the lovastatin just to keep my cholesterol in check because the endocrinologist that I was seeing before I started seeing her put me on the medication because at that time my cholesterol was very high. My cholesterol is normal now and she does run checks every 3-6\u00a0\u00a0months to monitor changes. She has not mentioned taking me off of this medication because she feels I should stay on it to keep my cholesterol at bay since the high cholesterol is genetic and not diet related, plus when I was put on the lovastatin my thryroid was functioning properly and then several years later my immune system decided to attack it and basically I only have half a functioning thyroid now. I am not taking the provigil yet because I can't afford it, so my psych doctor has written a new prescription called nuvigil, which I can get help from the manufactures in lowering the price. I am really confused and just want my mind and body back together and no longer have to live with pain and fogginess. Yesterday I went to see my regular doctor about this constant inflamation and pain that I have been having my whole life to get it checked out and try to figure out what it is so I don't have to eat ibuprofen like candy anymore. She sent me to get a whole ana profile done since past blood tests have shown positive ana, high sediment and high c- reactive protein. I have been struggling with this pain, poor memory, fatigue, fogginess and headaches my whole life and no one has ever tried to get down to the bottom of it. I have been tested for rhumatoid arthritis\u00a0\u00a0before, but that came back negative so I am lost as usual. I am considering going to see a naturopath to help me figure out what supplements I should take that would be safe to take with certain meds that I have to stay on because trying to figure it out on my own has been a huge challenge because I do not speak doctor lingo or understand it in great depth. I wanted to wait to get the results back from the ana test before I go see the naturopath because I might have to be put on something else. I hate being onj all these meds, but I know the risks if I don't take them. I definitily want to stay on my lisinipryl to protect my kidneys from damage, I want to stay on my thyroid hormone replacement, and I definitely want to stay on my antidepressant, citalopram because it has really helped me with my anxiety. Thank you and hope to hear back soon.",

            "answer": "Dear SScalio,I'm going by my intuition to say that your genetic predisposition tohigh cholesterol is related also to your low thyroid function issues.Is it possible you mother had low thyroid function?Please do not rush to give an answer, if she was never diagnosed.Just go with some classic symptoms, like narrow range of temperaturetolerance, unexplained pains, fatigue and tiredness, weight gain,sleepquality issues etc. All the symptoms do not have to be present.I cannot emphasize the importance of being 100% involved with your health matters.You need to know your before and after cholesterol numbers and ratios.Also very important to know your thyroid hormone lab results.If you are tested for the standard TSH, T3\u00a0\u00a0&T4 you can still have low thyroid function, (according to my suspicion, I think yes) so anything else discussed is kind of pointless.Thyroid dysfunction could be associated with almost ALL your issues!!!\u00a0\u00a0Please refer to my previous reply.Also you don't need to \"speak\" medical lingo, you just need to understand some fundamental basics, regarding your conditions.I find the best patients are the ones who are proactive and take their health matters in their hands. They have a much better chance of improvementcompared to some who -understandably so because of heir suffering-, ask for just a pill and don't take any responsibility.In your case, you are at least taking some action and you don't like to take meds, unless they are necessary.You can do your own drug interaction check online. It takes a minute!Please try to get some test results, also the results from the temperature test and post them or send me a message.Love and LightNiko",

    "question": "Hello, I am wondering if anybody has a suggestion of medications or anything that works to help with memory problems associated with SCT that will not cause more memory problems or possible brain damage with long term use? The reason that I have a fear of more memory damage or brain damage from certain meds or supplements is that while searching for medications and supplements to help with memory I have come across information that certain medications like aderall and others plus different types of supplements can actually cause memory damage with long term use, plus I already have memory problems and I don't need more and I am on other medications for other diseases that will have adverse effects when taken with certain supplements like Ginko Biloba .I really need something to help because I am planning on going to college and I want to be able to successfully store and retrieve\u00a0\u00a0the information\u00a0\u00a0that I learn instead of forgetting the information after some time of not constantly using the information. My doctor has prescribed to me provigil to relieve the feeling of constantly feeling tired and sleepy, but I am not sure it will help with memory retention and memory retrieval, so I was looking to also add something else to stabilize my memory. I take citalopram for major depression and anxiety which has helped my depression and anxiety significantly, I am on 2 types of insulin for type one diabetes, I am on Levothyroxin for autoimmune attacked thyroid/hypothyroidism like my pancreas, I am on lisinipril to protect my kidneys and lovastatin to keep my cholesterol in check. I also have ADD, but know I am positive it is sluggish cognitive tempo because all my symptoms fit that disorder, I have tried ritalin, but I felt like a zombie and lost track of time while on it. Please help me find something that will help my memory but not interfere with others meds that I have to take.",
