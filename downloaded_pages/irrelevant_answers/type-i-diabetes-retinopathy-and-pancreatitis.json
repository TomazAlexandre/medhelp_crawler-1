            "answer": "Diabetes is a hard and frustrating disease to have and live with.\u00a0\u00a0I know from experience, being diabetic for 27 years myself.\u00a0\u00a0I have felt like giving up when I was younger.\u00a0\u00a0I also knew that if\u00a0\u00a0I didn't get it together I would be very ill and not be able to do all the things I enjoy.I would suggest getting her involved in a suppport group.\u00a0\u00a0You can go to www.jdrf.org or ask her doctor or the hospital staff if they know of support groups at the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe talking to others in her same situation would help.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe she ought to see a therapist and figure out why she does not want to change her lifestyle and habits.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds as if she is depressed.\u00a0\u00a0Having goals for myself helped me start to take better care of myself.\u00a0\u00a0I went through periods where it seemed useless and hopeless.\u00a0\u00a0I went to college and then went on to get my master of education.\u00a0\u00a0I am very healthy today.\u00a0\u00a0I have much to live for and am very busy with my husband and two children.\u00a0\u00a0If she wants any of the things I have mentioned she must start taking care of herself.I had a lot of support from my mother and it was very helpful. Keep supporting her but don't enable her.\u00a0\u00a0 She is ultimately the one who has to take a stand and decide to take care of herself.",

    "question": "My 25-yr old daughter was diagnosed with Type I diabetes when she was 11 mos old. Because her blood sugars have been out of control since she was a teenager, she now has developed retinopathy and has begun a series of surgeries. And, she was hospitalized for 5 days last week for pancreatitis. She keeps saying she just wants to give up. I along with close family and friends are trying to be very supportive, but she is not willing to make any changes to her lifestyle. We do not know what to do. Advice?",
