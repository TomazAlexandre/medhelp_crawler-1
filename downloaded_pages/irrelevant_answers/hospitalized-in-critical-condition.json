            "answer": "well, I'm guessing that the high levels of iron in his blood would react with the high levels of oxygen that he'd get, and form harmful compounds. Those compounds can be especially harmful to heart muscle, if I recall correctly.Even though iron has been put in bread etc for many years, too much iron is still bad. E.g., I only buy multivitamins with no iron in them.The harmful compounds that would be formed are of a type called Reactive Oxygen Species.As a parallel example, there is a famous anti-cancer drug called adriamycin that can harm the heart, because it also results in similar iron based ROS.",

            "answer": "Hi Amy,Sorry to hear of your uncle's health problems.For some insight, the amount of iron within the cell is carefully regulated in order to provide an adequate level of the micro-nutrient while preventing its accumulation to toxic levels. Iron excess, either due to excess iron supplement use or accumulation in the body, is believed to generate oxidative stress, due to the high concentration of oxygen.It is somewhat paradoxical to have breathing difficulties and oxygen is contraindicated: But the result of breathing elevated concentrations of oxygen is hyperoxia, is an excess of oxygen in body tissues, and symptoms include disorientation, breathing difficulty and vision changes.Control is necessary to prevent oxidation damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, myopia, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is treated by reducing the exposure to elevated oxygen levels. Studies show that the long term recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is good. So good recovery is highly probable.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

    "question": "My uncle is in the hospital and can just barely breath.\u00a0\u00a0He has lost a few of his toes due to diabetes and is on his 3rd heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0His iron level is high and they will not give him oxygen because they say it could be fatal due to his iron levels.\u00a0\u00a0This sounds crazy to me.Is there anyone out there that could explain why they can't give oxygen with high iron levels?",
