            "answer": "Hi,Meralgia Parathestica is a painful mononeuropathy of the lateral femoral cutaneous nerve due to entrapment of this nerve as it passes through the inguinal ligament.This nerve\u00a0\u00a0is responsible for the sensation of the anterolateral thigh and it is a purely sensory nerve and has no motor component.It usually occurs in isolation.You require a in depth examination to assess your problem and root cause for it. Try to get an appointment as early as possible.",

            "answer": "Hello.Since you have symptoms in other parts of the body also, I am not sure if this is meralgia paresthetica only. A detailed neurological examination with relevant investigations are required. A spine MRI should be helpful.Can you reschedule the neurology appointment to an earlier date ? And how's the numbness now ?Regards",

            "answer": "I was diagnosed with MP back in Feb. 2007 after having shoulder surgery for a torn rotator cuff. When i first went to a doctor, they laughed saying what does your leg have o do with your shoulder. It wasn't so funny though when two other doctors said they believed it was caused from the position I was in during the surgery (beach chair position). They said being bent in that position for 2-1/2 hrs. pinchd the nerves in my pelvic area. Anyway, I've had the tingling in the legs but not the hands, EXTREME BURNING in both outer side of the thighs and exteme numbness in both outer thighs which I still have. The pain has gone away, the pins and needle pokes happen once in a while but the numbness is the same. The doctor toldme I will probably have to live with the numbness since it has not gone away by now. Good luck to you. I wish you well.",

    "question": "9 weeks ago I had a terrible pain for 20 mins in right thigh (in the middle ) and pain in the hip area.After subsiding it has left me with a numb thigh down the outer side.Also now I am having pins and needles in fingers of both hands and a tingle in the right cheek when I lie in bed .Doctor thought it was siatica but it seems more like Meralgia Parathestica.Would this condition have a pain initially and also have any of the other symtoms described.I now have a referral to the Neorology dept at our local hosptital but the waiting is 6 months.Should I do something about getting it quicker and what would you suggest is my condition.",
