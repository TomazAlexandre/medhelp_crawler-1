I came home and crashed and woke up with a G . . . awful sinus headache.\u00a0\u00a0 I just started acquiring a lot of allergic reactions in the past few years.\u00a0\u00a0Since I am treating now and hoping for UND soon I am worried about tramping in the woods (and doing just about anything that might upset the applecart) but really want to do some hiking.\u00a0\u00a0I should also ask about what sort of medicine to take to control the symptoms.",

            "answer": "I have had the same reactions for decades...and I fully believe that HCV creates a heightened state of 'immune response', so that any little thing triggers full immune system response...hence quick and frequent allergic reactions to almost any little trigger....chemicals, smells, weather, pollen, animal hair, stress, etc., etc.\u00a0\u00a0I think its why many of us seem to also suffer from Fibromyalgia....and related 'autoimmune' type syndromes.\u00a0\u00a0I think the virus does the work, then little triggers cause the full blown response.\u00a0\u00a0In 'normal' people the system is probably in a very low key 'immune' state, so it takes a LOT more to trigger allergies...or it takes very specific triggers to activate an individual's allergic response.\u00a0\u00a0And us...well just about everything known to man can trigger an allergic response in us...because we are right on the edge of one almost all the time without any trigger!!!Does this resonate at all with any of you?\u00a0\u00a0 Its my little theory....so thats my 2 cents!!!\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0The sad thing is even after being 9 years SVR, it still persists in me.\u00a0\u00a0I think the interferon also helped to train my body to have a constantly cranked up immune response to everything....\u00a0\u00a0Oh well, can't win 'em all!!!!DoubleDose",

            "answer": "All I can say about this right now is that since stopping my last treatment 10 days ago on the Riba and I think 17 on the Peg, my allergies have been acting up horrendously.\u00a0\u00a0It's like non-stop hacking, nose running/dripping, constant throat clearing, eyes itching, etc., etc.\u00a0\u00a0I normally have seasonal allergies, but it seems to me like they've been kicked into overdrive.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, I haven't gone into a sinus infection.\u00a0\u00a0I know on my last labwork, taken a 10 days ago, it was my last day-I'd had my Riba on that morning and my last Peg shot a week previous, my white cells were a lot lower; but, I imagine that with TX stopped, they've come back up.\u00a0\u00a0Would the lower white cells 10 days ago have somehow made me predisposed to a sinus infection?\u00a0\u00a0I hope not.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to need to be helping my Dad out for my mom's knee replacement surgery next week and I want to be well for that.\u00a0\u00a0On 09/02 they were 2.9 and the neutrophils were 1.7, which in the whole scheme of things isn't all that low.\u00a0\u00a0It's just that nothing I've tried to do for these dumb allergies seems to be working.\u00a0\u00a0Tried, Allegra one day, Benedryl another, saline nasal rinse...., was wheezing on final exam-Dr. noticed it as well and asked me if I had asthma..., anyhow, I've had to use my asthma inh. twice since (rescue type) since stopping TX and normally I can go like 8 mon. and never need to use it.\u00a0\u00a0Oh well.\u00a0\u00a0 I'm going to try and forget about it all and go to a movie!\u00a0\u00a0 Susan400",

Would anyone care to put this curiosity to rest?",
