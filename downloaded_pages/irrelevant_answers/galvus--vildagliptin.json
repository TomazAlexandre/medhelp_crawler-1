            "answer": "\"It may sound stupid but I am a little scared to take Galvus after what happened before.\"Nope, not stupid at all. Pretty sane to me and I can't blame you for asking. I would.Hopefully someone outside the USA will come along and provide you with some feedback. But don't keep your hopes up to long as Galvus is relatively a new player in Europe. Galvus has not been approved in the USA as Phase 4 Study [Clinical Trials on Humans], the combination of Galvus with Metformin started recruiting in September 2009.http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT00975065For a complete list of USA Galvus trials - finished/completed, recruiting, terminated, not yet...http://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?term=galvusI found this Sept 2007 article on Novartis combining Galvus and Metformin into a single drug called Eucreas which appears to be headed for European Union approval. [2 years? What's the holdup/delay?]http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/83406.phpAnd this Sept 2008 article. Note: \"Galvus received European Commission approval for 50 mg twice-daily in combination with the most frequently prescribed oral anti-diabetes medicines, metformin or a TZD,\"http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/120966.phpLastly, an 2007 article by the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [EASD] has Galvus, when added to daily metformin regime, being \"well tolerated\" by patients.http://tinyurl.com/yeq9meu",

            "answer": "Hi,Thankyou so much for all the info you gathered for me , very interesting reading.I seemto be tolerating the Galvus and have so far had no side effects ( only had 3 days so far but am hopeful). I am surprised as these are so simular to the Januvia.I must admit Im not altogether comfortable with taking new drugs on the market , my GP tells me my liver function will have to be monitored closely with blood tests drawn every three months.Thankyou again, its greatly appreciated.Angie",

            "answer": "You're welcome. Your GP appears to be well versed as he/she is as concerned about Galvus side effects as you are. The 3 month blood exams are spot on. Keep us posted on how you're doing, good and bad. Your experience with Galvus will help others when Galvus and/or Eucreas reaches across the pond.",

    "question": "Hi, I recently posted about severe side effects I was experiencing with the drug Januvia , I had\u00a0\u00a0severe stomach pains and sore throat. My doctor has now prescribed Galvus and said they are from the same family as Januvia. Has anybody tried this drug? if so did you experience any side effects ,especially stomach pains? .It may sound stupid but I am a little scared to take Galvus after what happened before. I am taking Glucophage and my GP has added Galvus as my blood sugar is not yet controlled. Did anybody gain or lose weight while on Galvus?. Sorry so many questions but Im feeling anxious about this. Thankyou in advance to anybody who can answer and give me any advise.Angie",
