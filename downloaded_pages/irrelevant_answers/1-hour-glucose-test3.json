            "answer": "I had the test just this past Friday with a orange flavored drink and it doesn't even take that bad. As for what to eat, maybe some toast with an egg but this test is pretty important and there is no way to trick the results of the test. If you don't have high sugar levels that's great but if you do taking these tests could determine whether your baby could have diabetes, etc. after birth so I would take it serious.",

    "question": "OK , so this Thursday I take the 1 hour glucose test, and I'm extremely nervous about it. This one I don't have to fast , I'm allowed to eat a small non sugary breakfast. Any advice would be appreciated like what flavored drink that I should ask for the test, what's best to eat before the test, and just how to pass it so I don't have to take the 3 hour one lol. Anything to calm my fears.",
