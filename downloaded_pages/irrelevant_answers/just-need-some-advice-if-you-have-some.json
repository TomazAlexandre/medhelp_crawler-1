            "answer": "No, none of us here are doctors but other diabetics so we can't diagnose your son. However, unfortunately, yes, it does sound like he has diabetes. The A1C is only an average and would balance out both lows and highs. His fasting might be normal but it sounds like food raises his blood sugar much higher than would be normal for someone without diabetes. It sounds as well as if he is experiencing significant lows. I'm sorry you went through him having a seizure; I know that must have been frightening.I'm glad you are going to a pediatric endo soon. Let us know how it turns out. Also PM me if you want a couple other websites where you can talk to many more people with diabetes.Zoe",

            "answer": "hi,based on the information you have given it is not possible to diagnose wether he has diabetes or not. it has to be diagnosed very systematically.reasearches have shown that it can take upto 9 years for type 1 diabetes to present after the triggering exposure. presence of anti islet cell antibodies and GAD antibodies does suggest that he has predisposition to develop type 1 or maybe it is in early stages.the best way to go about is to do a GTT which again is not confirmatory and make sure you control the diet.this might or might not be diabetes but for sure he is high risk to develop one so the first thing would be to control diet.see a ped endo and discuss your case",

    "question": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0I need some advice to any of those willing to give it.\u00a0\u00a0I will try to make this as short as possible.\u00a0\u00a0I have a 21/2 year old son that has been having blood sugar problems.\u00a0\u00a0At first I noticed he would camp out by our fridge because of the water dispenser.\u00a0\u00a0I just thought he liked the buttons so I turned on the child lock and went on.\u00a0\u00a0But then he started drinking everyone's drink.\u00a0\u00a0If you left it on the table it was gone and since I have 5 children besides him they all feel the need to have their own cup with water and he would literally drink it down.\u00a0\u00a0My husband even lost his black coffee (not hot) to my son and he downed every bit of it.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed also his diapers were more soaked than usual.\u00a0\u00a0He has a great appetite for his age but is in the failure the thrive category.\u00a0\u00a0On top of the meals he eats he drinks 2 pediasures a day per doctor's order in order to gain weight which seems to never be easy to do and he starts losing if he doesn't have them despite a good appetite.\u00a0\u00a0He wears glasses since 9 months and has started taking them off a lot more.\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational diabetes so I checked his sugar and saw it was 180 after a meal.\u00a0\u00a0His fastings would range from 90-117.\u00a0\u00a0Mostly normal but would get a few in the 100's.\u00a0\u00a0I watched for a couple of weeks told my doctor and she did a fingerstick and urine test and both were normal.\u00a0\u00a0Fast forward about a month.\u00a0\u00a0I went to get him out of bed and he was very lethargic.\u00a0\u00a0I checked his BS and it was 40 (retest was 41).\u00a0\u00a0I gave him some juice and he perked up right away.\u00a0\u00a0I started checking his BS again and now I was getting a lot more in mid 200 range.\u00a0\u00a0I made an appointment with my ped but a week before his appointment he had a seizure.\u00a0\u00a0I think it could have been a low because since school started for my other children we have been getting up early to eat breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't eat well at breakfast.\u00a0\u00a0My neighbor and I were taking him and going to a late lunch when he started having a seizure.\u00a0\u00a0We took him to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0They never did a blood sugar even though I told him his blood sugars were kind of crazy.\u00a0\u00a0He had an EEG and CT and both were normal.\u00a0\u00a0Waiting for the MRI.\u00a0\u00a0Since the seizure we started getting high 300's and even one over 400.\u00a0\u00a0He had some lab work done during another ER visit where his A1c came back normal (5.2) but higher than the last one(4.4). All lab draws were normal which did not surprise me since he hadn't eaten in a long time by the time they did the lab test.\u00a0\u00a0The only things that did not come back normal was a Islet Cell antibody test which was <1:4 (they told me it meant it they were present but low) and the Anti-Gad 65 which was High at 66.6 suppose to be 0.\u00a0\u00a0I finally have an appointment with a pediatric endo on the 5th.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know about these test that came back abnormal?\u00a0\u00a0Is there anything I should take to the endo?\u00a0\u00a0I know you can't diagnose diabetes but does this sound like it?",
