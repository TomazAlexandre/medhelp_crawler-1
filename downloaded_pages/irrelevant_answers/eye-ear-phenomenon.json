    "question": "Hi,\u00a0\u00a0Over the last 6 months I believe I have been experiencing a rapid deterioration in my eye sight, particularly night vision, tolerance to glare and bright light and abilility to read especially from a computer screen.\u00a0\u00a0From time to time i experience a clouding of vision, followed by intense watering of the eye and soreness of the actual eyeball, this is always coupled with a strange sensation and noise deep in my ears (almost as if I have water in my ear, with a wind trying to blow through it).\u00a0\u00a0This auditory sensation then radiates to the back of my eye ball where the same vibration is felt and then further visual disturbance follows.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, the phenomena occurs in response to bright light or glare and is a source of discomfort.\u00a0\u00a0Normally, I wear glasses and recently visited the optometrist for an eye test.\u00a0\u00a0He said my eyes appeared healthy, although there is an expected deterioration in vision since last test and prescription 5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0i am long sighted and was given a prescription of\u00a0\u00a0+2.25 (R) and +2.50 (L).\u00a0\u00a0I am no lo0nger able to tolerate looking at a computer screen for more than 5 mionutes with out intense rubbing and eye soreness, which then lasts all day.\u00a0\u00a0I presently have a sore L eyeball, due to a day of reading in a library yesterday, the actual eyeball is sore to touch (feels bruised) and when I breathe in, it also is sore.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like my L eye is losing vision more rapidly then the right, and I can't explain the vibratory sound and sensatio in my ears.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my GP about it, who has ruled out diabetes although I am deficient in ferritin.Can anyone help?ThanksChristina",
