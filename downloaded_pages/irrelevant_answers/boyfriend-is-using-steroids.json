            "answer": "Your boyfriend should be more careful about his diabetes and stop taking the steroids. A book by the American Diabetes Association recommends frequent checking of blood sugars if prescribed a steroid by a doctor.Your boyfriends diabetes doctor should be consulted as he would know where to get help and how to stop the cravings for the steroids. 5'11\" and 220 lbs. is certainly not small, as i'm 6'4\" and 183 and don't think i'm small. i don't understand how people get into those mind frame where they are perfectly normal and think their body size is too small. i'd recommend psychological counseling for that, which may be part of what is necessary to stop the steroid use.He should be checking his blood sugar frequently as it may go high as well with all the extra sugar he is eating. i have had diabetes for 31 years now and i understand how difficult a lklifestyle that diabetes enforces on us but for a normal lifestyle as possible keeping your blood sugars as close to normal as possible is a must. Please recommend he see a doctor. Good luck, bret",

            "answer": "i am a type 2 diabetic, i am 47 years old and was positive three years ago for diabetes, i am 6 foot 3 and weigh 270 been pumping all my life. the only way to get big and strong is proper diet and training, i am in the gym seven days a week, your boyfriend is putting a gun to his head with steroids and rest assured all the bodybuilders are doing steroids, he needs to stop this before he ends up in the emergency room, yes it is tempting to get big quick but when he stops all the size will go away, at his age he is still young and dumb so take out a good life insurance policy on him and reap the benefits.",

    "question": "My boyfriend is currently using steriods. He's had juvenile diabetes since he was little he's now 23. I ask him time and time again to stop doing it but he say's it's messing with his head and he can't stop. The other day I woke up to him having a diabetic seizure.His sugar level was all the way down to a 33. A week before he was having light seizures. He also had an episode a few days before this last one but we got it under control before it got to bad. All of this is really starting to scare me and I'm not sure what to do to help him through this. All I know is he does want help but neither of us know what to do. He's only been taking the steroids for about two months but they already have a hold of him. He thinks he's getting smaller when he's really getting bigger. He doen't do regular cycles. He only takes short breaks which maybe last a week. He ups his dosage irregularly and by quite a bit. He's about 5'11\" and weighs 220lbs. This is definately not small but he thinks he is. He also eats high amount of protien, fat, and sugar to help his weight gain. He'll up his insulin dosage to make up for the extra sugar and fat he eats. I want to know the affects steroids have on juvenile diabetes. Also I would like to know if there is any help out there for his situation. I've looked all over the internet for information on this stuff. I can not find anything. Maybe there is a book you recommend or something you can suggest I do to help him? And aside from the steroids what affects can his eating habbits have on him?",
