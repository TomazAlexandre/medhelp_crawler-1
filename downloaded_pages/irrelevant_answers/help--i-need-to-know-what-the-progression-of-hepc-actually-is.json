            "answer": "Some people have the flu like symptoms on treatment. The more water he drinks the better for him.When I was about 25 weeks into treatment I started walking very slowly because of my hemoglobin going down. But then I took Procrit. It takes awhile to work.I think NYgirl said she fell a couple of times in the shower while on treatment but I didn't. I prefer a bath. How old is your brother. What stage is his liver disease. What genotype?\u00a0\u00a0It's very important to take fat with the ribavarin. I had 8 or 9 almonds after breakfast then my pills. And ice cream after dinner with my pills. Helps you digest them better and avoid nausea.",

            "answer": "Actually I passed out from the low hemo - just passed dead away a few times (prior to that had never happened before).I agree with Grandma and would take my pills with some form of nuts - even peanut butter toast with a yogurt smoothie (things I never ate before but they worked).Unfortunately nothing can tell you what will or won't happen during treatment but we can give you a good list of MIGHTS.\u00a0\u00a0Just remember because we talk about it doesn't mean it will necessarily happen to him...it's just what some of us have gone through.Treatment isn't fun in any way but it's NOT the hardest thing in the world.\u00a0\u00a0I did 72 week while working and being a single mom. I was worn out every single minute but..was able to do it.If I could do that - your brother can do it certainly with you to help him.He's very lucky to have someone as caring as you.\u00a0\u00a0THAT is a HUGE advantage!\u00a0\u00a0He might get what we call 'riba-rage' from the pills...they make you just snap and get mad over NOTHING (but then it goes away) but if it happens................it's not you.\u00a0\u00a0A good doctor should explain all of this to you but if you have more questions you just let us know and we'll try and help.",
