            "answer": "The evaluation you had to evaluate these symptoms has been extensive. I assume they checked other things such as Vitamin B12, Folate, RPR, and markers of inflammation and connective tissue diseases. If all of this testing is negative and your neurologic examinations have been normal, then I would agree that this is unlikely to be neurological. If the symptoms persist perhaps re-evaluation in the future would be reasonable. Good luck.",

            "answer": "Yes, HIV tests, too. All negative, thankfully. Blood tests, diabetes, B12, Reiter's syndrome, infectious disease consult, vision tests, urine tests. The main concern, at least according to the neurologists, has been the possibility of demyelination. But they found nothing, which has been a relief. Symptoms have come and gone. I am still having a lot of vertigo, but it's not the really violent kind.",

    "question": "Dear Doctor,Thanks for your help. I am a 29 yr.old athlete male.My neurological test results are essentially normal and I'm told symptoms are probably not being caused by a neurological disease. I'm feeling okay. I'd like to know whether I can feel comfortable that I'm ''out of the woods.''December 2002 I had a primary outbreak of HSV2. It appeared at first to be some other infection and I was given Cipro, then later Acyclovir and it cleared up. 2 mos.later I had urinary trouble, retaining urine, and have had ever since to varying degree. Had a cystoscopy showing probable prostatitis. I started two months of Cipro. I got numb in left leg lasting a day, limbs falling asleep, electrical sensations (including shocks when I bent my neck), spots in my vision.These would come and go. I've also had vertigo, muscle cramps, bowel probs, sexual probs, numb hands, burning sensations on the skin, trouble swallowing, tension headache for 6 weeks, cold sweats, muscle twitches everywhere, difficulty concentrating, cold extremities.The tests: Two sets of MRIs of brain and C and T spine, with and w/o contrast, 9 months apart. These show nothing abnormal, except a 3.2 cm arachnoid cyst/pineal area. EMG normal. VEP normal. SSEP Normal. Neuro-opthamologist consult normal. Spinal Tap showed no oligoclonal bands, no HSV, but minimally elevated protein - 50. Neuro exams, even during periods of symptoms have been fine - no signs. Tested for everything - normal. I'm glad tests are over. I can deal with the symptoms, but is it too early to celebrate being disease-free? Thnx",
