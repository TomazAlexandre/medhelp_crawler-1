I have never heard of smoking causing a person to lose 40lbs. in 60 days! That is absurd. Have you had his liver checked out? The situation is not getting better, from what you say he is getting worse! Be firm, push for the care he needs (nicely) demand answers. Do not leave the office without some help for him. Obviously smoking is not helping him at all but I really doubt that has anything to do with his weight loss, loss of appetite, diarreha, etc. Sometimes you have to be a squeaky wheel to get the help you need.Good luck.",

            "answer": "Did doc test for thyroid and/or diabetes - does he urine a lot and real thirsty. Constipation/loose stools, fatigue sound like thyroid.I have thyroid (Graves' Disease). I lost a lot of weight and continued to do so until treatment. I thought I had cancer or diabetes so I ate according which didn't help with the weight situation.\u00a0\u00a0If I didn't eat when my body gave me signs too I would get nausea, real hot (cold sweats) and rapid heart beat and very sick to where food would not help.\u00a0\u00a0Tried to force myself\u00a0\u00a0to eat but I lost my appetite by then.\u00a0\u00a0I ended in bed the rest of the day sleeping it off. It was real bad so I started listening to by body and ate even if I just had ate 15 min ago.Those are the three things that come to my mind, Thyroid, diabetes and cancer, however I am sure there are other health conditions with your husbands symptoms.Good luck to the both of you - I hope you find the cause soon.\u00a0\u00a0No fun being sick!~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I am not a Doctor or in the Medical field.My statements and comments are meant asinformation only, not as a diagnose or treatment,for that is between you and your doctor.",

Gastro dr did order a peliv/abdominal CT scan and they found nothing with that either.\u00a0\u00a0He is having a colonoscopy next week.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have these symptoms? Nausea-kept food down so far, just stops eating after a few bites. Constipation/loose stools, fatigue.If the Gastro dr doesn't find anything durring the colonoscopy then I wont know where to turn next for the cause of all this.\u00a0\u00a0He is the one ordering the test at this point and will not take him back to the family dr. My husband does not look healthy.\u00a0\u00a0He is only 42.\u00a0\u00a0 He is 5'7\" so his weight loss is about 25% of his body weight in a matter of months without trying.\u00a0\u00a0He is to weigh daily and write it down but I'm also trying to keep a food diary and write down when he's nauseous hopeing that helps.\u00a0\u00a0He consumes plenty of calories on good days to not be loosing.\u00a0\u00a0On bad days he consumes alot also but mainly from drinks when he cant eat.My mom had cancer 20 yrs ago.\u00a0\u00a0This is my biggest fear since his weight/eating problems seem to be identical.\u00a0\u00a0It is not stress causing this.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions, PLEASE!!!!peipaws",
