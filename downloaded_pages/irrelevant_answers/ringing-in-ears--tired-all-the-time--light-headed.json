    "question": "I have been feeling strange now for the past 6 weeks, it is hard to describe, I would not say dizzy but more of a lightheaded feeling and sometimes my legs feel heavy and I have to stop or hold on to something. I also have a continuous ringing in my ears but only bothers me when I concentrate on it. I have gone from hating lying in bed in the mornings to not wanting to get up and feeling extremely tired all day long. I have no symptoms when sitting but I feel like I don't want to socialise as I feel safer sat down.I have just sold my business and about to start a university course so stress could be a factor. I have also had 6 weeks off not working so could the tiredness just be my body reacting to not having work pressures etc?I will go the doctors soon I just keep hoping it gets better, I think the worrying though is making it worse! The symptoms have started since I have been on holiday in Egypt where I kept hydrated at all times, the only thing I had on holiday which made me feel strange was a deep massage in my shoulder that was quite painful",
