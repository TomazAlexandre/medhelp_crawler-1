    "question": "Earlier today I posted a comment concerning how cinnamon had helped lower my wife's blood sugar.I should have mentioned that we are not selling or soliciting anything.I am sure that there are plenty of sources for many other brand names and they will probably work as well.The brand I stated just happened to be stocked at the health store that we frequent.If you would like to discuss this issue with Alice, feel free to contact her at\u00a0\u00a0tilson.***@****",
