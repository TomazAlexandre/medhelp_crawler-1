            "answer": "First off, there are no doctors on this forum. This is patient to patient.Its difficult to answer any of your questions since you kept a lot of information to yourself a secret;1.) When you test? B4 meals? After meals?2.) Tests doctor performed? Glucose? Thyroid? Pancreas?3.) Test[s] results?4.) What have you looked into?TIP: When posting a question and to get useful solutions don't keep things secret such as glucose levels, body weight & height, the nutrition being followed, and amount of medication [all] taken daily. And describe fully when your symptoms occur - mornings, after exercise, or constant, etc. Same applies to when you self test too. These things are important to know.",

            "answer": "You're overdue with seeing a doctor to redo those tests. Please ask for an OGTT, an A1c test, and check your pancreas C-Peptide levels. Reason I say this is at first you say \"My fasting is 100\" then \"fasting glucose tends to be rising over the years. It used to be 70-80 range.\" Along this line if eating makes you feel better after exercising and \"if I don't eat breakfast.\" makes you feel worse, the possibility of hypoglycemia, type 1 diabetes, should be looked into as with diabetes type 1.5 [LADA].",

            "answer": "Thanks. Definitely I'll be ordering these tests now. Besides this, I would like to do some more tests to find what else is causing asthma-like symptoms. Perhaps adrenaline fatique test. The reason is that besides primary symptoms my shortness of breath has some other triggers such as cold and exercise. As asthma has been ruled out, What else do you think could contribute to the problems?",

    "question": "3-4 hours after meals, or when I'm hungry,\u00a0\u00a0I frequently get symptoms such as irritation, heart palpitations, asthma like symptoms feeling like I can't take deep breaths, extreme hunger... most of them go away as soon as I eat something.Now sounds like hypoglycemia (reactive or whatever) but when I check my blood glucose, it is around 100 a bit more which means it's not hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0.What else may be causing this? My docs say it's not asthma. Any other endocrine disorders such as Insulin Resistance can cause this?\u00a0\u00a0What else should I look into? Any doc here has a clue?",
