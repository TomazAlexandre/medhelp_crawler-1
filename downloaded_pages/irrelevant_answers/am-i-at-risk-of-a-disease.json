            "answer": "That is a little heavy for your height. You're young, though, and have that going for you. Try to get out and get some exercise every day, even if it's just walking. And try to eat healthier. More salads, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, chicken, fish, turkey and lots of water. Try to avoid fried foods and fast food as much as possible.You might want to ask your mom if she could take you to a nutritionist or dietitian who could help you come up with a menu plan that you could live with. Eating healthy doesn't have to be boring. There are lots of tasty, healthy menus out there that I think you'd like. Check out our healthy eating forum on here for ideas.As for what diseases are you in danger of. Diabetes is one. Heart disease is another, along with high blood pressure and high cholesterol. The one I'd be the most worried about at this point is the Diabetes. It takes awhile to get heart disease. But anything you do right now to improve your health will lower your risks of any of those.Best wishes.",
