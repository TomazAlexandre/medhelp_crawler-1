It appears you may have a condition known as agnosia, sometimes due to a lesion on the inferior longitudinal fasciculus. You need an evaluation by a competent neurologist and a 3T MRI with dye contrast. Keep me posted.",

    "question": "My doctors (internal and oby gyn) suspect that my forgetfulness, and my diminishing ability to cognitively speak are due to my endometriosis.\u00a0\u00a0Which, can be more than true.\u00a0\u00a0But will this cause me to say things I was not intended on saying? For instance, I'll be talking about research (I'm in grad school) and instead of saying\u00a0\u00a0\"his paper\"\u00a0\u00a0I'll say \"the chair\"\u00a0\u00a0because it was in my line of sight. I do not do this on purpose. But I'm finding myself using nouns that have nothing to do with what I'm saying. You can imagine the looks I\"m getting.I forget a lot. I'll be doing something and forget why I'm doing it. Things I know I know, just aren't there any more.Sometimes I can't write basic paper response, and I'll forget basic writing styles that I've used for over 10 years.I'll loose my depth perception and\u00a0\u00a0I'll be clumsy for no reason.\u00a0\u00a0And sometimes my vision will go.They say after they'll take out the endo and put me on dupo pervera shots I\"ll feel better.\u00a0\u00a0But my symptoms feel too extreme.\u00a0\u00a0I have a cousin who had surgery to remove a tumor and an aunt who has an inoperative tumor that if it moves, shes gone. I know I am vulnerable to blood clots. I have a history of diabetes and I am sometimes on predisone for asthma and/or allergies.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 34.So let me ask you, does this sound like typical hormones? Am\u00a0\u00a0I overly concern or is there something I should have checked out?Thanks in advance.",
