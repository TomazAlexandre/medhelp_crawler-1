Sound like our computer colors are set differetly. Since each thread alternates between colors often I thought it meant something. Curious, that's how my mind works. It must make sense somehow, everything does, right? lol Thanks",

    "question": "Hi guys, I'm sorry to take up a thread to ask this question, but it's really bugging me. Since I started treatment on 6/6 I've had one really bad weekend, other than that I really can't complain. Occassional headaches especially behind the eye sockets, a little weight loss, a lot of leg pain in the beginning which has now subsided, and has traveled instead to my neck and back. Other than this I feel fine. Well someone just told me that they become concerned when they hear of minimal symtoms or no symtoms, because that usually means that the treatment is not working. I don't believe that there is any correlation between treatment symtoms and clearance, but now I'm kinda of wondering since this seed was planted in my head.What you you guys think ? :)",
