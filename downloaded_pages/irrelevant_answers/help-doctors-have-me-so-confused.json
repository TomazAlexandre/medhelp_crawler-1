            "answer": "Hi, THese labs posted are within normal range. So from that, it does not sound like hypothyroidism.THere are any number of factors that need to be verified and ruled out.Did they run the thyroid antibody tests and the free t3?Are you blood sugars running in range? Have you changed manufactors of your insulin?Have you had your adrenal glands tested?Did he offer to run any further tests to verify that this is being caused by the diabetes? I know from experience, that most drs, just like to decide instead of verify.That really gets my goat, because if all they are going to do is make an educated guess, I can just stay home, get on medhelp and get my friends opinion. (did not mean to get on my soapbox)This is just ssome suggestions to get you started. I am sure someone else will come along with some other good suggestions. In the meantime, TRY,(difficult I know from experience) to relax and not stress to much as that does damage to your body.",

            "answer": "As Peg said TSH is \"normal\" but the T4 is useless to help decided if you have a possible problem converting FT4 into FT3.FT3 (Free T3) is essential is maintain metobolism. If you are suffering from weight gain - you could be having issies with FT3.\u00a0\u00a0You other symptoms indicate this also could be an issue,Your doctor is running basic thyroid testing on you and you do not want that. Request the Free's ran and not the standard T testing.Additonally adding a TPO antibody test - a cortisol test would be good too.",

            "answer": "It tests for antibodies to your thyroid, to determine if your thyroid is attacking itself. Google hashimoto's disease.In regards to your dr, I would look for another one, because as you put it, he can't look past the diabetes. It sounds like he has made his mind up and is not open to any other diagnosis or treatments.Reread what I said about the drs. It is true, as you have experienced it first hand.",
