            "answer": "Hello,There are two possibilities for your symptoms.It can be a sebaceous cyst. A sebaceous (or epidermoid) cyst is a noncancerous swelling under the skin. It is lined by packed outer skin cells. The cyst itself is filled with oil or dead cells. Under certain conditions such as stress, increased activity, mechanical irritation, diabetes, or other concurrent illness these cysts may enlarge and become somewhat tender.Application of warm compresses and antibiotics if infected can be helpful.Second possibility is of swollen lymph node. Lymphadenopathy (swollen lymph nodes) is usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Other causes include allergic reactions, arthritis, cancer, metabolic diseases, and an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism).I feel that examination by a surgeon or gynecologist along with breast examination and biopsy is must.Pls get it done at the earliest.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "2 Days ago I found a painful lump under my arm. I figured it was an ingrown hair, I deal with them all the time. I squeezed it, and instead of the usual white pus, some clear liquid came out. It also felt deeper than an ingrown hair usually does. Yesterday, I noticed it was way bigger than an ingrown hair usually is. It's even visible, without feeling it. I squeezed it, and more clear liquid came out and it went down in size. But it got big again almost right away, and today, I decided to really try and get this \"ingrown hair\" out. I squeezed and squeezed. Besides being very painful, there was still only clear fluid, and no sign of a hair. Besides its size, all of this is usually normal for an ingrown hair for me. But as I was trying to \"pop\" this lump, I found another, smaller one. This one also felt like an ingrown, but it's deeper than an ingrown would be. It's painful as well. In my mind, all these worst case scenarios are going through my mind, like that it was a cancerous tumor, and by squeezing it I caused it to spread and make another lump. I've looked online and I know about all those things it could be, but I didn't find anything that mentions specifically the growing after draining and the second lump. Thanks in advance.",
