            "answer": "HI, I'm 40, female and also have had tingling mostly on my left side (with a bit on the right) for about a year. It's mostly in my feet, mostly my left foot, but I also have tingling in left center of my back sometimes, and occasionally on the left side of my chest, and\u00a0\u00a0my left inner thigh and abdomen. I've never had it on my face or hands. I've had\u00a0\u00a0brain and spine MRIs that were normal. (I had carpal tunnel in last year due to underactive thyorid and working on computer, but that's ok now).\u00a0\u00a0My endocrinologist (thyroid MD) thought the tingling might be due to underactive thyroid, but my thyroid level is normal now (due to med) and MD no longer thinks this is from thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I've also suffered from migraines most of my adult life, and can't see any connection between the tingling sensations and migraines. MDs can't find a cause in my blood labs either. I work at a computer all day and don't know if that can be a cause, because I still have tingling on weekends when I rarely use the computer. Neuro MD told me normal brain and spine MRIs rule out MS, lesions, pinched nerve, disk problems. Have you had a EMG?\u00a0\u00a0It tests your nerves and muscles for other nerve conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Did you have your blood checked for diabetes, thyroid problems, etc? If you haven't has spine MRI you might have that don to see if you have pinched nerve or disk problem. I'm still seeking a diagnosis. Good luck!",
