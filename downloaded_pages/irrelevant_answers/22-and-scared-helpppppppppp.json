            "answer": "Do they think you have gestentional diabetes? If you do, I hear that they put you in insulin and then everything is okay. And you can stop insulin after baby is born. This type of diabetes goes away.Sorry about your previous loss. I couldn't imagine how horrible that must have been for you. I have had 2 miscarriages, but nothing compares to losing a child to SIDS.No wonder you are so scared for this baby. Hang in there. Hopefully the doctors are watching you closely and that all goes well this pregnancy.",

I can't do the 3 hr tests because I had a gastric bypass, so they have me monitoring my blood sugars 3 days a week 6-8 times a time on a home glucose testing machine. I come from a family of type 2 diabetics, so they are being extra cautious. So far my levels are all normal. I think they are being paranoid, but I am willing to do what they want for the safety of baby.I hope your test comes back normal.",
