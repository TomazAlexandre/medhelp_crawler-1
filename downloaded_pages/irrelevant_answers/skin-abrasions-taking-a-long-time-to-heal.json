I keep a supply of SuperGlue handy for the tiny, painful, annoying cuts on my hands.\u00a0\u00a0It works wonders, believe me!\u00a0\u00a0And, of course, neosporin for the flare-ups.Keep your skin well hydrated; Aveeno Anti-Itch helps.\u00a0\u00a0And shorter, not-so-hot showers.\u00a0\u00a0If you're addicted to two long hots a day (like I am/was), this may be brutal, but it's well worth the effort!\u00a0\u00a0I was sooo itchy I wanted to crawl out of my skin; since I cooled it in the shower dept, I'm way better.\u00a0\u00a0Interferon really dries you out.Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hey Lady.\u00a0\u00a0Two weeks, huh?\u00a0\u00a0Well... it's not unusual with Hep C or for someone on treatment for wounds to take longer to heal.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know that it's necessarily reason for concern UNLESS it gets infected.\u00a0\u00a0 If the open cut area gets redder around the edges, or it gets hot feeling to the touch, or if it starts oozing or draining, then - it might be infected and you might need to show it to your doc.\u00a0\u00a0If it were me, I'd probably keep it covered for now and make sure I keep my hands off it.\u00a0\u00a0I'd wash it good with hot soapy water, maybe put a little of Neosporin on it, cover it with a bandaid, and just watch it.\u00a0\u00a0And if it gets worse, I'd ask the doc.\u00a0\u00a0 Don't scratch it! :)\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck.",
