            "answer": "Yes still sticking to it. On the 2 days of lower calories, I'm always WAY below 600 calories but drink lots of water. It took some getting used to though. What I like is the way that the pounds come off very slowly and not quick like most diet plans. It really hasn't affected me in any bad way physically. I haven't had any more blood tests yet, I was due to have one at the end of August but forgot all about it. I have noticed how I seem to have more energy now too.",

    "question": "OK, I am going to try something new. I've just finished doing a lot of research on the findings regarding diet, ageing, heart disease, diabetes, cancer etc. Latest findings seem to suggest that a particular growth factor increases in our bodies when we consume protein, and this causes all those illnesses. The growth factor is high in nearly every resident in developed countries and it switches all the cells in the body to a different condition. There are two apparent conditions which cells can adopt. One is low duplication but high repair. Two is high reproduction, but low repair. The latter causes the diseases because too many cells end up with high levels of damage. The first is the better, getting lots of repairs done. When cells are in the first option, high repair mode, we produce more neurons in the brain too, reducing the chance of brain diseases. This is thought to be for making us more intelligent to find more food. So, how does the diet work. I will be trying the 5-2 diet, 5 days normal eating, 2 days diet. This has worked in many trials, lowing cholesterol, blood pressure, growth factors. It puts the cells into high repair mode and makes your body more youthful, not in looks, but in reaction times etc. Your major organs become more healthy. It also causes lots of body fat to be consumed. For 5 days I can eat what I want, but limited to 2000-2500 calories. For 2 days I will be limited to just 600 calories. Eating low/high fat meals made no difference to the results. I will try this for 2 months and see what happens. A Doctor in the UK tried this method, because he had a 1 in 10 chance of developing heart disease, diabetes and many cancers. He was actually high in blood sugar. At the end of week 5, his blood showed VERY reduced sugar, he lost over 14 pounds in weight, his growth factor decreased by 50%, his blood pressure dropped to normal, his cholesterol trigs/ldl reduced 30% and his HDL increase 10%. He was able to stop taking his 8 medications a day. So I am going to see for myself. Obviously if I feel unwell, I will get medical help. I will let you know how it goes.",
