            "answer": "I've had Juvenile Diabetes for over 20 years. It's not easy to understand. For years I thought I knew all there was to know about diabetes. Now that I'm getting older, it seems that the \"rules\" are changing. I have been fighting thyroid over the years but never for very long. The doctors would start me on meds. and within a few months they would take me off. My son is 2 1/2 and I've been having more trouble than ever. Half my hair is GONE. My thyroid issues are confusing even the doctors. Medicine is not helping. My hair is not coming back. They say it could all be related but they don't know why. Worse than that, no one has told me what I can do to stop the hair loss. That's why I'm searching for answers here. The only thing I've found is that Iodine will help with \"hormone\" issues that are caused by diabetes, thyroid and stress. I was not eating ANY salt and all the things that lower iodine in your body I was doing!! Peanut butter, fluoride and many more.... Diabetes, thyroid, and STRESS can all affect your hair. If you find an answer please share it with me. I'm going to keep looking.\u00a0\u00a0Good Luck!!!",
