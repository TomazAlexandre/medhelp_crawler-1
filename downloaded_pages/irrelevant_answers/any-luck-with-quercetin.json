It has powerful antioxidant, anti-histamine, and anti-inflammatory action. Research has shown it to be useful for allergic conditions, asthma, hay fever, rheumatoid arthritis, and lupus. It is also used in diabetes and cancer.Quercetin inhibits the production and release of histamine and other allergic/inflammatory substances.

            "answer": "YES!I've had seasonal pollen allergies since puberty. Anti-histamines make me terribly drowsy. I started taking Quer/Brom combo for something else and noticed my allergies went away!\u00a0\u00a0Googled it and found out why! Been taking it ever since and hardly had ANY pollen allergies for 3 summers.\u00a0\u00a0Only 1,000mg in the am worked for this purpose.Recently, however, I've developed a sudden allergy to raw carrots. Also have been battling swollen, itchy, burning eyelids. Believe all of these to be due to hormonal fluctuations at my age (47).\u00a0\u00a0Perimenopause is a time when women can experience new allergies or an increase in existing ones. Sooooo going to up my Quercetin to 3,000mg/day as suggested by someone in this thread.\u00a0\u00a0Since Quercetin has been so effective for my seasonal allergies at a low dose, I'm confident that the increased dose will help this new development.",

            "answer": "I have been taking 1,000 Maxiflav\u00a0\u00a0brand powdered Quercitin twice a day for 3 weeks. I am under a doctor's care for this dosage and treatment, i have had only one mInor angioedema attack (face) attack during since atarting Quercitin. I no longer have allergy eye symptoms and have completely stopped taking Benedryl. In addition to this, I have just received blood tests results showing a number of delayed reaction food allergies. My doctor will likely put me on a strict elimination diet in hopes of successfully reintroducing them later. All of this is to remedy my angioedema, which I've had for 5 months.",
