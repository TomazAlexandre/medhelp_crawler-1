    "question": "DearI have a mild pressure in the left side of the chest and vibration at the back (exactly near the left back bone). Not aggrevating during exertion. Took all the test (ecg, 2d echo, stress) and almost a year back and everything came normal. Cholestrol levels are good, no diabetes. Gastroenterologist prescribed HP Kit after taking endoscopy. The pain got relieved for a few months. The same started this March 2010 and still continuing. BP is normal. Also chest xray is normal. The gastroenterologist gave as moderate oesophagitis and mild gastritis. After taking Rabiprazole i am not having a relief. The symptoms continues to be. Please advise the exact cause.",
