            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your pain. If you had thyroid cancer then you should ideally get a bone scan done to rule out any cancer in the bone. It can also be a referred pain from abdomen like stomach ulcers, acidity, pancreatitis, or from the chest like in heart attack, pericarditis, pleuritis, pneumonia, and pulmonary embolus. Please discuss with your doctor. You need some urgent tests. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

Reach accross your body and gently push on your elbow as you can to stretch neck/shoulders. Oh yea check out the \"Budwig diet\", she found this in 1951, that helps Cancer, M.S., diabetes, Eczema, psorisis and arthritis. MD Anderson uses it. Prayers are with you.",
