            "answer": "Just try and stay away from sugary foods and carbs. You do still need to eat some carbs though. If you are having a hard time controlling your sugars talk to your doctor and they will put you on meds or adjust them accordingly and sometimes that's what's best. I have to see a specialist called a perinatologist, they monitor high risk pregnancies, like people with diabetes and pregnant. I also had to see a fetal cardiologist to check my baby's heart. I'm type a 2 diabetic but I was able to manage my sugar levels very well this entire pregnancy. I'm 35 weeks and I don't have to see the cardiologist anymore cause my baby's heart is perfect. She will be on the big size around 9lbs cause of the extra insulin she got from me but they said she is gonna be very healthy. So as long as you check your sugars regularly and eat how you're supposed to your baby will be just fine. Just don't lie about your sugar levels, if they are bad then just tell your doctors and they will do what is necessary!",
