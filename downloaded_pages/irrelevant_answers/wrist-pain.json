            "answer": "Hi.Your symptoms do suggest a carpal tunnel syndrome is present. However, nothing can be ascertained right now as a full physical and neurological examination hasn't been done yet by a trained health professional.CTS is basically a complex of symptoms resulting from compression of the median nerve as it passes through a narrow tunnel in the wrist.You should have your wrists examined by a physician to help you manage the pain.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I am not sure if I have carpal tunnel or not. I have a recent onset of pain in my wrists. Everyone I speak to tells me that it is carpal tunnel cause I have a job that I type all day long. I am only 28yrs old though. I take Glucosamin and I thought that would help. I have mild relief. My mother gave me a brace for my wrist I wore it for about a week cause the pain got to the point I couldn't take it anymore.Also when I bend my wrist toward the floor a bump appears and it was very sore, after wearing the brace for a week it got tolerable again. If I do to much lifting or cleaning anything with force.",
