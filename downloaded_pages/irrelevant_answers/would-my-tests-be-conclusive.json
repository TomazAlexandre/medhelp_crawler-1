            "answer": "I appreciate the response - it's just so much misinformation and well I'm in a new relationship and I wanna make sure we are kosher. We both got tested Nov.07 and thats two years after my last relationship and that was only cunnilingus done and nothing else. Yet, it seems like lately all you here is people saying tests don't work or the STD's lay dormant - so yeah... freaks me out a bit.",

            "answer": "Agreed, and this is what I try to tell these people. Hell, my mom is even angry at me because I'm having a hard time letting go. I even went through the tags like the Doctor mentioned and it stated so many times my risks were extremely low; and I did have testing in 2005 and 2007, which were negative (tested for HPV too) so I should just know these tests are conclusive right?I had the PCR-DNA testing done, swab style during the pap exam and blood drawn for HIV and Syphilis.",

        {
            "answer": "Yes, everything is conclusive.\u00a0\u00a0What I meant was that even if something had been dormant, you still would have tested positive, so you can (and need to) let this go.The risk from oral sex is low, and your tests are negative.\u00a0\u00a0Its time to move on.If you can't, maybe talking to someone would help you get to the core of it all.Good luck!AJ",

            "answer": "Thank you for your advice - I'm not sure how many people thank you, but I think you deserve it. Yeah, as I said I read through the doctor's notes in the fact my exposure even if the ex had something in the through is rare to contract through cunnilingus but... it's hard to let it go due to personal issues with the ex.Yet - I know I have to relay on the fact that after two years SOMETHING would have pulled up if I had something.Thanks again... and I think I will see about talking to a doctor.",

    "question": "So I was in a relationship from Jan .05 until Aug. 05 where all the guy did was finger and perform cunnilingus on me. Nothing more - no penetration(PIV), no fellatio and no Anal Play. I had STD testing (for all I could) in March .05 and everything came up negative and then I had STD testing done in Nov. 07 because someone on Yahoo Answers! informed me that STD can lay dormant even from tests for two years. I freaked out a bit...Mind you the guy and I were in a long distance relationship and he told me he got tested every six months. He performed oral on me a total of perhaps 5 times in the relationship when mostly we only did fingering or DS play with no PIV or fellatio involved.Do you think I'm worrying over nothing? I have no symptoms and I was tested again Nov. 07 and everything came up negative. I had to have a glucose test done in Feb.08 due to diabetes and they just ran a syphilis test with it too. (Mind you in Nov. 07 I was tested for all STD's I could). Everything has been negative... so should I just let go and move on? Am I just feeding into the media-hysteria of anything you do will cause an STD?Thanks for the information and help...",
