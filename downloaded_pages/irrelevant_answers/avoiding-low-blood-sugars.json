            "answer": "Hello, Kevin!\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to get you confused, maybe the MedHelp administrators are just trying to make you feel young at heart!\u00a0\u00a0;-)I'm not a medical professional, just the parent of a kid with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Great exercise question, it sounds like you're doing a very good job understanding how your body works.\u00a0\u00a0I'd suggest you look at two paths for an answer.\u00a0\u00a0First is around what type of insulin therapy you are using.\u00a0\u00a0Are you on a pump or multiple daily injections?\u00a0\u00a0Pumps are easier for runners and other athletes to use, because it allows you to turn off that basal rate which is causing your issues.\u00a0\u00a0If you take a long acting insulin like Lantus, you cannot 'turn off' that insulin in your system when you exercise.\u00a0\u00a0So that's the first thing I'd do, is looking at getting on the pump.The second path is around the types of carbs you take while exercising.\u00a0\u00a0Glucose tablets are an excellent way to raise blood sugar quickly, because they are made of the most basic form of glucose, and it gets absorbed very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0But I know many people that do not like them.\u00a0\u00a0I met a marathon runner who works for Animas who was diagnosed when he was a kid.\u00a0\u00a0During marathons, he uses packets of honey (like what you'd get at a restaurant).\u00a0\u00a0He sticks them under a wristband, and pulls one out when he's feeling low.\u00a0\u00a0Still a faster acting sugar than some, it's easier on the stomach, and it's easy to carry with you while running.\u00a0\u00a0There are other options, as well, of faster acting sugars (skittles, etc.).\u00a0\u00a0Try experimenting with some and see how you respond.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "Thanks for the great ideas.\u00a0\u00a0They are much appreciated.First I refuse to consider the pump at all unless I am medically forced to.\u00a0\u00a0I just HATE the idea of having that thing attached to me all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Preference thing.\u00a0\u00a0I think they are great for kids.\u00a0\u00a0But like you intimated they will not correct my problem of LOW blood sugars.For the second point.\u00a0\u00a0I was hoping for something that was less in the lines of eating.\u00a0\u00a0Running upsets my stomach.\u00a0\u00a0That is compounded by food being in it.\u00a0\u00a0I can not run if I have eaten in the past 2 hours or it is the old heave ho....\u00a0\u00a0:(\u00a0\u00a0And I was hoping for something a little more regulated than food.\u00a0\u00a0For example how much OJ or Food is not a precise as 30g of glocuse.Wondering if perhaps there is a substance that I can take to increase sugar levels like I would take Insulin to lower them.\u00a0\u00a0I guess that was more to the point.",

            "answer": "Actually, a pump can help with lows during exercise, because you can turn off the basals which is giving you lows now.\u00a0\u00a0But you're right, pumps aren't for everyone.Food/carbs are the only way to raise blood sugars.",

            "answer": "Not sure that it IS the Basals that are causing the lows.\u00a0\u00a0But I think you are partially right.\u00a0\u00a0I am on Lantus now and I am sure that plays a role in things but I was on Humalog N before and I would skip my dose of N the mornings (I work out at night) and I would work out and still had lows.\u00a0\u00a0Bottom line is if you are at normal levels of 100 or so and go running for an hour no matter even if there is NOTHING in your system you will go low.One of the questions I had was Can Glucogon or something similar be used to raise Glucose levels quickly and accurately?",

            "answer": "My twin is a type 1 diabetic, as am I. Her lifestyle is very active with two horses. She finds that Gatorade or any sports drink is her best solution to lows. But I find that you have to drink a LOT of the liquid since it is more diluted than simple orange juice. Less likely to upset your stomach, though, for it is made for athletes. You might want to just substitute Gatorade for your water bottle. Sip a bit every few minutes rather than guzzling, and it replenishes electrolytes as well as glucose.Yup, recognizing the low coming on is hard, for sweating just isn't any enlightenment for us. No real answer for that other than possibly a continual glucose monitoring device, which has its drawbacks as well as advantages.",

            "answer": "I run between 4 and 6 miles a day 5-6 days a week.\u00a0\u00a0But I use a pump.\u00a0\u00a0I am on .7 units/hour normally.\u00a0\u00a0Three hours before I run, I reduce my basal rate to .15 units/hour, and my blood glucose levels are usually the EXACT same when I am finished.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugar is not high before starting either.\u00a0\u00a0It seems like the three hour mark is right when my BG starts to go up, but by starting my run at that time, it doesn't have time to go up very much.\u00a0\u00a0Having the pump connected to you can be a pain in the neck ,but they are totally worth it...seriously..especially for runners.\u00a0\u00a0Also, pumps are not just for kids. Many adults wear pumps.",
