            "answer": "Hi and so sorry you have such pain. This doesn't seem typical for a diabetic. Perhaps you should see a neurologist? Have you tried meds for nerve pain? There are quite a few out there? I would get it checked out and if it is \"normal\" they can still give you something for the nerve pain. There is Neurontin, Lyrica and others that are helpful for nerve pain.hope you feel better soon,mkh9",

            "answer": "Hello MMPrice,Welcome to MedHelp's Pain Management Forum. I am glad that you found us and took the time to post.... but very sorry to hear about your painful symptoms.Sorry to disagree with another response but in my humble opinion your symptoms are not all the uncommon in long-term diabetic patients. I am not an expert, nor do I pretend to be. I am wondering if you are experiencing Diabetic Neuropathy?Diabetic Neuropathy occurs in when blood glucose levels effect the nerves and cause changes and damage. This occurs in approximately 50% of all diabetics to one degree or another. This condition can effect: Nerves in the skull (cranial nerves); Nerves from the spinal column and their branches; Nerves that help your body manage vital organs, such as the heart, bladder, stomach, and intestines (called autonomic neuropathy).Please don't misunderstand me. I am not saying that you have this condition. I am only suggesting that it may be a possibility. This does not occur over night... it is more common in diabetics that have been diagnosed for 10 or more years. Tingling or burning in the arms and legs may be an early symptoms of Diabetic Neuropathy. It often begins in your toes and feet. You may have deep pain, often in the feet and legs and obviously it can effect other extremities.As said above there are medications to help control your symptoms. Maintaining your BS within normal limits is even more important if you have developed Diabetic Neuropathy.PVD produces similar symptoms and is also more common in diabetics. PVD stands for Peripheral Vascular Disease and PAD stands for Peripheral Arterial Disease. They are often used interchangeably. This condition effects the blood vessels in the lower extremities (often other vessels in the body too). So instead of effecting the nerves as in Diabetic Neuropathy PVD effects the blood (oxygen and nutrients) supply.Again symptoms are a bit similar between PVD and Diabetic Neuropathy but definitely not the same. A physician can determine which if any condition you have by conducting a good clinical examination.Please consult your physician as it's time to treat whatever it may be that you have.... these symptoms should never be ignored but that is especially true in those ppl that have diabetes.This could also be a spinal structure issue along and/or CT (Carpel Tunnel) Syndrome. It's impossible to guess so please consult your PCP.Please share with us what you discover. I will be very interested to learn the outcome of your physician appt. I'll look forward to your updates and wish you the very best.Take Care,~Tuck",
