    "question": "Hi, I am a 50 year old female with fibromyalgia, depression, irritable bowel, chronic bladder problems, possible neuropathy.\u00a0\u00a0I weight 152 lbs and have gained approx. 10-15 lbs over the past year which I thought was due to the Lyrica that my doctor put me on for the nerve pain.\u00a0\u00a0I also have been having lidocaine injections monthly for the past year and quarterly I have it done intraveously for fibromyalgia.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugar levels have always been normal up until I started with the lidocaine injections, since then it has been steadily increasing.\u00a0\u00a0Last fall it was 4.4, then in the spring 4.8 and now it is 5.4 - My family physician says it is my choice whether to start on Metformin now or wait until it reaches 5.8\u00a0\u00a0I read somewhere on the internet that lidocaine can affect your blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone confirm this for me?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks",
