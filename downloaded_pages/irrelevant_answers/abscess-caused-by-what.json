            "answer": "Hello,Recurrent boils and abscesses are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders. So get your blood sugar evaluated. Other causes need to be ruled out if your blood sugar levels are fine.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi I'm 21 and have been dealing with abscesses for a year, I've gotten one on my arm, 6 on my buttocks, 4 on my thigh area, and 1 in the pubic area. They said it was a staph infection but no one can tell me why it keeps happening, so I'm going to see a different dermatologist and see what he says, I'm just glad to see I'm not the only one with this problem, I have also had one abscess drained and felt everything I thought I would die, so now I only go to my primary care doctor who drains them and I don't feel a thing, but I just wanted to know if anyone was diagnosed with an underlying condition ie diabetes, cancer, aids etc because they say that could be causing them?",
