            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.The symptoms of stroke depend upon the part of the brain involved and memory loss occurs due to loss of nerve cells in the brain.Brain damage due to stroke can lead to vascular dementia due to ischemia of the brain tissue. This is usually seen in patients who suffer from memory loss or mild cognitive impairment due to stroke.Hope this answers your question.",

            "answer": "Hi,This happens in stroke when a person suddenly exhibits memory loss after talking normally. It all depends on the extent and location of brain damage.If you can shift your mother to a better facility it is definitely going to be good. It is important that her diabetes and BP are kept under control. The prognosis varies from person to person depending upon the general condition of the patient and extent of damage. Improvement is generally seen if the memory loss is not progressive.Hope this helps!",
