            "answer": "I was diagnosed with Addison's disease in 1978, and have been on a maintenance dose of hydrocortisone since. They also added Florinef, .........in 1994. I had a hip replacement this past Ja............10 days into the recovery from that.........I was lightly weight bearing on the affected leg.......when it collapsed on me.......the femur breaking in three places..........the recovery from that has been long and hard......I have severe osterporosis.........and have been treated for that since 2000, with Fosamax.........vit. was added two years ago.......I believe due to the treatment necessary for the Addisons........I will have bone problems for the rest of my life.......I know it's extremely important to weight bear........as much as possible.......it's really the only proactive thing I can do.......to counter the weakening of bone........because of the Addisons............my advice for your wife would be.......make sure she stays active........that will delay.....bone weakness and bone loss.........do everything as safely as possible.......since bone breaks are more easy to occur.......I don't know why she should be suffering from bone pain.......I've never heard of that being a symptom of Addisons..........The Graves disease may contribute to her problems.....I'm not very familiar wit it's symptoms........best of luck to you both...........peace and love........Norma",

            "answer": "I have no adrenals and take replacement steroids as well. If she is taking too much, the long term effect will eat bone and muscle as well as other detrimental issues. I had my adrenals removed as my body was producing too much on its own.Has she had a dexa scan?Does she take D3 supplements? Vitamin D testing?Does she take calcium supplements?Is she taking cortef/hydrocortisone or a long acting steroid like prednisone (long acting steroids will have more bone issues)Does she take salt tablets, fludrocortisone? This will help with blood pressure issues - I take 2grams of salt plus salt my food to support my body but everyone is individual. If I sweat, I need more. My doctor says to take up to 12 extra grams a day. When I feel lousy, I eat more salt. perhaps she needs more salt. A person with addison's needs a lot of salt (unlike most people).\u00a0\u00a0I walk through the store and when I find high salt stuff I\u00a0\u00a0yell *score* and my husband laughs... he needs low salt.She needs a great endo to balance all her conditions - as the diabetes can cause neuropathy, and the graves has issues too if it not under control. Your poor heart can be taking a beating without care. She needs a cardiologist if her BP is too low so she can get a good check up.I hope she feels better soon.",
