            "answer": "Hello,Some of the important causes of muscle cramps are overextension of the muscles,overweight,prolonged standing during the day,dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium,calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism,peripheral vascular disease(narrowing of the leg arteries which causes poor circulation),sarcoidosis,excess alcohol,nerve compression, and sometimes liver disease.Some of these causes like dehydration,being overweight,alcohol intake and prolonged standing are modifiable by efforts of the patient. Stretching and massaging the affected muscle (usually a calf muscle) can usually relieve an attack of cramp. A painkiller such as paracetamol may help to ease muscle discomfort and tenderness that sometimes persists for up to 24 hours after a cramp has gone.My advice is to consult a physician and rule out the above medical conditions by thorough investigations as without physical examination and investigations, pinpointing a diagnosis is tough.Also get your thyroid levels evaluated.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing and if you have any additional queries.",

    "question": "On top of other problems, I have recently been having muscle spasms in my hands, legs and feet.\u00a0\u00a0The hand problems occur when I've driving, holding up the newspaper, writing a letter. My hand gnarls up into an ugly claw, my fingers spazzing painfully.\u00a0\u00a0The problem with my legs and feet usually occurs after I've been asleep.\u00a0\u00a0I will be awakened with muscle spasms in the ball of my feet or the calves of my legs or sometimes the deep muscles on the inside of my thighs.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the pain is so bad I can\u00a0\u00a0hardly get out of bed. Once I'm up on my feet it takes up to 20 mins. of walking around to work the spasm out.\u00a0\u00a0I'm curious as to what type of Dr. a person would see to have a test to check the ratio of salt, water in your system etc.\u00a0\u00a0I've had the normal things like potassium, magnesium etc. checked and they're fine.\u00a0\u00a0 I take one 0.088 mg. of Levothyroxine daily.\u00a0\u00a0I take a multivitamin each day also.\u00a0\u00a0I am a little overweight and haven't been getting enough exercise I know.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible this is the problem?",
