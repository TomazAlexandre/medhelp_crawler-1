            "answer": "My baby is measuring almost 3 weeks bigger also. I have diabetes so its normal for baby to be larger. I've also been having contractions and I'm dilated to 1. My dr did an ultrasound and said that I'm more than likely not going to make it to my due date of Aug 8th. He also said that if I make it to the beginning of july and start contracting again, he won't do anything to stop it and she'll be here early. I wouldn't worry too much about it. You just might have a little bit of a bigger baby. The ultrasound can tell you more but even those aren't 100% accurate.",

I hope no one thinks negative or judges me badly but I'm hoping the due date isn't off for reasons regarding who the father could be. I don't know what I'd do if this whole time I've told someone according to the due date that baby was and for him to get here and not be?:/",

The midwife said if he measures off again at my appt in 2 weeks that we will have an ultrasound done. I'm very anxious for the appt. Has this happened to anyone else? Could baby come earlier than the original due date now? I asked questions while I was there but more are coming up.",
