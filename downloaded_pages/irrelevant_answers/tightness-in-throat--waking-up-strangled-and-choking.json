            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!The symptoms could be due to acid reflux or GERD, or due to hiatal hernia. Omeprazole is a good drug to combat this. Along with it you can try over the counter antacids. Avoid heavy meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bed at least 2 hours after food.Also if you suffer from sinusitis, blocked nose etc then it could be due to post nasal drip. If the above mentioned problems are ruled out then you should rule out diabetes and sleep apnea and heart problems.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
