            "answer": "It's extremely hard to make an accurate comment as I did not see the MRI myself and whether or not the lesion is really in a place that would have caused her symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I'm not quite sure what your doc meant by \"autoimmune disorder provoked by stress\".\u00a0\u00a0What I can say is that it's necessary to know the exact location and size of the brainstem lesion. Second, if it appears to be a significant lesion, an investigation should be set out to find out the cause which includes stroke, MS, or a number of other possibilities.\u00a0\u00a0Even though your mother is older than the classic MS patient who is a young female, this can certainly represent MS and we have seen it present in men and women of this age group. Again, your neurologist has had the opportunity to review her history in detail and see her MRI whereas I only have the info provided by you.\u00a0\u00a0But I would tend to be more aggressive in trying to figuring out what this could be.\u00a0\u00a0If it looks like a stroke, I would go about checking cholesterol levels, diabetes, carotid ultrasound, etc... to maximize stroke risk factor reduction.\u00a0\u00a0I would also start aspirin.\u00a0\u00a0And if I thought this was MS I would consider a spinal tap so that proper longterm therapy can be initiated if it comes out positive. There are of course other possibilities that this lesion could represent as there are other possible causes for her symptoms. Talk to her neurologist again and pin him/her down as to what they think it could be and what they plan to do with it.\u00a0\u00a0If you feel that you need further investigation, consider a second opinion at a major academic center. Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi, my mother (55 year old) felt sudden numbness in one side of her face.\u00a0\u00a0She went to the ER, had a CT and MR scan done.\u00a0\u00a0The CT showed nothing, but the MR showed a single lesion on the brain stem. The neurologist gave her cortisone and the numbness went away in 1.5 - 2 days time.\u00a0\u00a0The neurologist believes this to be caused by an auto-immune disorder provoked by stress.\u00a0\u00a0Is this \"auto-immune\" disorder common?\u00a0\u00a0What about possible MS, which I understand is more prevalent with younger adults?",
