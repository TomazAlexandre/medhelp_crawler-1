    "question": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0My mom's blood work came back with a reading of Creatinine as 0.38 and normal range is 0.60 - 0.88.\u00a0\u00a0BUN/Creatinine ratio is:\u00a0\u00a029 H, and normal range with our lab is 6-22.What should she do in order for this level to go to normal?\u00a0\u00a0Does this mean the kidneys and/or liver are not functioning at their optimal level?Does this have to do more with the liver or kidneys?Thank God, blood sodium went from 122 to 130 in 3 weeks' time.Thank you very much, and I would greatly appreciate a reply.",
