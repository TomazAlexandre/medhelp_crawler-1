            "answer": "Dear Ms. Dunayew:Sorry to hear about your multiple problems. It is difficult to tell you exactly what is the cause of your problems with the information at hand. Usually, when we see symmetric or at least bilateral problems we begin to think of systemic causes for an illness.\u00a0\u00a0The many problems you have might fall into this area.\u00a0\u00a0If the problem were something like B12 deficiency, alcohol, lupus, diabetes, hereditary (genetic), toxins, etc the laboratory data, family history, and physical exam would have begun to sort out the problem. Maybe more rare things should be begun such as amyloidosis or other autoimmune disorders besides lupus. To make matter worse for you is the preveious surgeries.\u00a0\u00a0These can cause many problems you describe and need to be factored into the equation of symptoms. Likely a detailed evaluation of before surgeries and after, the progression of symptoms, the current neurological exam with comparison to the other previous exams, lab results, MRIs will all have to be further evaluated.Sorry I am not much help.CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "I have several herniated discs in both upper and lower back. Surgery was done to remove 60% of one. The surgery left me with RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy) in the left leg and foot (where L5-S1 sat on the nerve). After an EMG recently...I was diagnosed with Peripheral Neuropathy in my right leg, Carpel Tunnel Syndrome in both hands and Ulnar Neuropathy in my elbows. Several blood tests were done...I am borderline ANA and in the 50's with anticardiolipins. My Rheumatologist says it is not Lupus etc.\u00a0\u00a0My neurologist thinks something is causing my neurological mess...any suggestions as to where I should go next to discover a cause...any suggestions would be appreciated.",
