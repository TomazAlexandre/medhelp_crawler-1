            "answer": "Hi, anemia can cause symptoms of fatigue and drowsiness. If you have not been eating well, its likely that anemia could be causing your symptoms. Was a Hb done?\u00a0\u00a0This can help detect anemias. Hemoglobin is measured in grams per deciliter of blood. The normal levels are women: 12.1 to 15.1 gm/dl and men: 13.8 to 17.2 gm/dl. Diabetes Mellitus and Hypothyroidism could also cause the symptoms described by you. A simple blood test could help detect diabetes and hypothyroidism.
