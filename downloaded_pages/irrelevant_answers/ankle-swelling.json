            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I understand there have been numerous doctor visits and investigations. A single ankle can swell in gout, rheumatoid arthritis, deep vein thrombosis, trauma, fracture, ligament tear, tendonitis, bursitis or ankle strain. It can also be due to localized infection of the skin above and not be related to the joint.You need to go over these causes with your treating doctor to understand the cause. See if thrombosis is ruled out.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into.Take care!",

    "question": "I've had swelling in my left ankle for almost a year now. I've been to podiatrists, orthopedic doctors, foot and ankle specialist, etc. and no one can tell me what's wrong. I've done the R.I.C.E. treatment, was put in a soft cast for a week and even had surgery recommended to me because the swelling was and still is causing nerve compression. The doc wants to remove the part of the nerve that is being compressed. The swelling is starting to cause some pain upon walking and I've have gone way past frustrated in trying to get answers. The swelling is in my left ankle and extends up to right below my knee. Can anyone give me any kind of idea of what's going on?",
