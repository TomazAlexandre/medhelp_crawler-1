    "question": "Two years ago, around the same time I hit menopause, I began having BIG problems with heat intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0My internist didn't seem to get it.\u00a0\u00a0Kept asking me when I got these flashes.\u00a0\u00a0I tried to explain, NOT flashes.\u00a0\u00a0All the time and last long time.\u00a0\u00a0Different from night sweats and face flushing.\u00a0\u00a0Put me on .1mg estradiol which did help menopause symptoms and 10 mcg daily of cytomel but still I could not wear a sweater in winter, or long sleeves or anything but light weight material.\u00a0\u00a0Heavy sweating all year round. People around me are freezing and I have a fan directed straight at me on top of a/c.\u00a0\u00a0Recently referred to endo and she took me off cytomel and put me on 50 mcg a day of synthyroid and ran all kinds of tests. In five months I gained 50 lbs., walked like an old lady (I am 55) back pain, elbow and hip pain, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Tests came back T-4 was 4 and was diagnosed with Hashimoto thyroiditis. On synthroid 2 months but no improvement.\u00a0\u00a0She then took more tests and doubled my hormone which I am not crazy about.\u00a0\u00a0I now wear two weekly .1 mg patches to get .2 mg.\u00a0\u00a0No improvement from the heat intolerance and sweating. This time the additional tests showed marked vitamin D deficiency.\u00a0\u00a025-OH D3 was 12 and D2 was <4. So, it says 12L.\u00a0\u00a0Now just put on 50,000 units ergocalciferol to take once a week on top of all the other meds. Just started taking that.\u00a0\u00a0I guess it could it explain the joint pain.\u00a0\u00a0GTT tests showed normal so no diabetes though an elevated fasting glucose of 108.Thing is, I just don't match up to any pigeon hole. Hypothyroidism I should be feeling cold all the time, and the hyperthyroiditis has the heat intolerance.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, and my PTH is 31.5 and CA 10.3 so that's okay.\u00a0\u00a0Recent bone density test shows more than fine.\u00a0\u00a0Everything over 100.\u00a0\u00a0Average was 117.\u00a0\u00a0I am just so tired of sweating all the time and being so over-heated.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the fatigue has gotten much worse and the lower back and joint pain has made it very hard to get back to the gym.\u00a0\u00a0The weight gain so fast has freaked everyone and I hate to go anywhere.\u00a0\u00a0I went from a size 10 to a size 20 in clothes.\u00a0\u00a0Help!",
