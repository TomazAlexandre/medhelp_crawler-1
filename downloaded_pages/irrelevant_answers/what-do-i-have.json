            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If the nerve conduction studies and MRI are fine, then you need to consult a good endocrine specialist who can balance your endocrine organs well. Diabetes (you may have this too), hypothyroidism and adrenal and pituitary function may not be in harmony to cause numbness, twitches etc. Also get serum electrolytes and parathyroid gland function assessed. Itching after shower can be due to pressure urticaria or due to polycythemia (increased red blood cells). It can also be due to increased sensitivity of nerve endings.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "This may sound dumb but after my surgery my thumb and other fingers, toes,etc go numb it is a lack of calcium. After surgery my parathyroids are not processing calcium. I was put on 6000mg then endo added calcitrol because It was not being absorbed. So have your calcium checked. Also most people now days are low in Vitamin D I was put on 50,000 for 8 weeks.",

    "question": "Been going from doctor to doctor. Started with numbness in tip of left index finger, then top of hand up to elbow, then pins and needles jumped to rt. fingers, hands, and up forearm to elbow. Went to emergency room when rt. hand, elbow and left foot and leg could tremble and shake on command and I could stop it too. Happened in sleep with lots of twitching. Neck and shoulders real tight and rom limited. Feels like need support to hold head up by neck. Went to er, family doc, neurologist, orthopeadic for broken rt. foot, neurosurgeon (who operated on me twice for pituitary tumors), and now being sent to rhumatologist. Seems like noone takes me seriously.Been on naproxen, Had nerve conduction test, lots of blood work, mri of cspine. Have a disc protrusion at c5 but not cause of problems. Seems like all tests come out fine. I am borderline for diabetes, need fish oil supplement, and b12. Already on lots of meds for nonfunctioning pituitary, thyroid and adrenal gland. Meds for hormonal imbalance and depression due to pituitary tumors.Also have itchy skin when hot or when getting out of shower.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I can barely function in the morning, as I have every muscle in my body stiff and sore and aching. Feels like a ran a marathon the previous day. Does improve as day goes on. Muscle relaxants have helped.What do u think i have?",
