            "answer": "Generally, the reason anti-depressants can cause blood sugar rise is that they slow down the metabolism, which is why they often cause weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0It's usually thought it's the weight gain that causes the blood sugar problems, not the anti-depressant itself.\u00a0\u00a0You don't say that these problems have risen to the level of diabetes, but different anti-depressants have different effects on people.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, switching anti-depressants is very hard and other drugs might now work, so it's not so easy to just switch around for many people.\u00a0\u00a0The proper way to deal with this is to work on you diet.\u00a0\u00a0There's a book called the Anti-Depressant Survival Guide that might give you some help with this, though I don't think the particular diet recommended in the book is a good one because of its overuse of wheat and dairy, which can be problematic in anyone but particularly those with mental illness, but it's a good place to start to learn how anti-depressants can affect our bodies.\u00a0\u00a0There are many supplements which are reputed to help with lowering blood sugar, including ashwagandha, holy basil, American ginseng, eleuthero, cinnamon, chromium and many others.\u00a0\u00a0Since many of these are also supports for the adrenals, they are good adjuncts to anti-depressants in other ways as well.",
