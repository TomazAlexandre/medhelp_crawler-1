            "answer": "Hello,Group B Streptococcus (GBS) is a type of bacteria that is found in the lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy adults and in the vagina and/or lower intestine of 10-35% of all healthy, adult women. Normally, the presence of GBS does not cause problems.But sometimes like in pregnancy(which is a stressful state in itself),immunocompromised states,low immunity,hormone changes,under stress and even idiopathic(cause not known), GBS bacteria can invade the body and cause serious infectionYou should consult your gynecologist and get your blood sugar levels also done as your symptoms may be due to diabetes.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Thank you very much for your help! Since I last spoke to you I have had tests for diabetes, thyroid, and haemoglobin, which have fortunately all come back negative.I have had an internal examination done and the doctor could not feel for any abnormalities. I still get a lot of itching and sex is very painful. I have noticed that the itching actually comes from near my anus as well, and was doing a bit of research, when I came across a condition called psoriasis. Throughout my life I have had extremely scaley, inflamed, itchy, explosive (!) skin, particularly bad on the soles of my feet when I go to hot countries in the summer, to the point where I cannot walk. I am wondering if this could be psoriasis. I have some pictures of my feet when they are bad, Do you think it would be a good idea to take them to my doctor?I also read that psoriasis can be triggered by streptococcal infection, which would make sense.My doctor has booked me in for an ultra sound scan to check for unwanted activity in my pelvis as well.Thank you!",

    "question": "My questions is, what are the treatments available for group b strep? I am 22 years old and not pregnant. It's taken me two years to go to the doctor about it because I always assumed it was thrush, as the symptoms are similar, itching, burning of the labia and perineum and extremely painful sex. Me and my partner just can't have sex which obviously has a big emotional impact on both of us. When I finally went to my GP she did a smear which was all clear, and did a swab for thrush which came back negative but it showed up for group b strep. She seemed a bit mystified by it, as am I, and gave me some penicillin to take for a week. I have read that group b strep is sometimes associated with diabetes. The doctor did mention before when we both thought we were dealing with chronic thrush that she would test me for diabetes but she didn't mention it last time I went in for the results. Do you think its a good idea to get tested for that? I have to pee a lot, get very thirsty, am low in energy, and my pee smells a bit but that could just be my body fighting the infection? I don't know. I am a bit scared that I won't be able to have a normal sex life ever again and was wondering if you would be able to give me some hope! Thank you.",
