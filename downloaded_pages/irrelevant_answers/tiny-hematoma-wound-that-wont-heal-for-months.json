            "answer": "Curiously, I had the exact same \"dot\" on my chest. It was diagnosed as a hemangioma, and I was told it was harmless.\u00a0\u00a0\"They sometimes get infected\" I was told. I insisted on having it surgically removed and biopsied. Psychologically, it was very disturbing. The biopsy was normal. I would suggest that you visit a dermatologist for an in-person evaluation.",

            "answer": "Anything that is scabbing over and the scab falls off and it forms a scab again and does not appear to be healing, should be examined by your doctor.As we age we do get little red dots (cherry hemangiomas) and brown marks appear anywhere on the body.\u00a0\u00a0Your spot may be one of those, but because it is not healing you should make an appointment with your doctor to get it checked out.Best wishes.",

    "question": "Hello,I've got a small redness of 5mm in diatmeter with a dot of blood exactly in the middle of my chest.It just occurred to me that it won't heal and I can remember it for several months. It didn't grow at all over this time. It forms a small atypical scab, but it won't cover it all and it does not heal.I have recently (two weeks ago) had some abrasion wound from playing sports and although they got a little infected at the beginning, they are in a healing process (a scab formed it it's almost gone now).I am male, 28, non-smoker, not drinking excessively and I don't have diabetes (or diabetes signs) from what I know.I do have a contact dermatitis history (triggered usually by certain chemicals).Does anyone know what that might be? Does it not heal because it's covered (there is no friction with the clothes since it's in the middle of the chest)? Or it's something more serious? Should I see a doctor? What could I expect?",
