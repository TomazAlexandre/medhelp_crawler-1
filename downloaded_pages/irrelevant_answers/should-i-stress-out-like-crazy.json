            "answer": "I find it is best not to chase the occasional highs, you only end up getting more stressed and then in my case my blood sugars go totally crazy.If you find that these highs are re-occuring on a regular basis then I would talk to your Doctor about increasing your night time or slow release insulin. Mine is Lantus, but there lots of varities.I hope this helps.",

            "answer": "HIJust a small comment. You might try taking yoga and meditiation to help you with diabetes. Yoga can not just control but even cure diabetes. You need to keep practicing for days,weeks even years and wait for the miracles to happen slowly.I am a Type 1 diabetic and my levels are like 70-110 (fasting )and less than 160 ever since I started doing Yoga. I measure my levels 5 times a day and now it is only one or two odd days when I actually overshoot the Postprandial Levels of 180. I have not gone for an hbaic but I am certain that it would come below 6.For some inspiration you might wanna read http://www.selfgrowth.com/articles/Siyag1.html. There are some self practice videos on google videos. Just go to google and type ramdev and you would see two videos that teach yoga and pranayam by his holiness\u00a0\u00a0swami ramdev.Best of luck.",

    "question": "Hello. This is not the first time i post here. I am a Type 1 Diabetic, for about a year now, and my recent A1C was 7.3 (BAD), the ones before were below seven. In the mornings my sugas always goes up like crazy, to about 250 !! No matter what i do. I then check it, and give myself insulin to bring it down right away. That number doesnt last more than 1 hour. But after i see it, i stress out like crazy for the whole day ? Should i be that stressed out over this, or will 250 for an hour not hurt me all that much. During the daytime i keep my numbers below 150 all the time. Today in about 5 hours, i will be wearing DexCom, so maybe it will make my life easier. Overall lately, i have been very stressed out and depressed. I dont know what to do.",
