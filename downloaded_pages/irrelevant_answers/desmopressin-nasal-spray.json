            "answer": "Hi.\u00a0\u00a0Your father can use Desmopressin up to four sprays daily, but he has to consult with his doctor first before he increases the frequency of sprays per day. I'm posting several links to some websites which provide more detailed information about this drug:http://www.tiscali.co.uk/lifestyle/healthfitness/health_advice/netdoctor/archive/100004179.htmlhttp://www.medicinenet.com/desmopressin-nasal_spray_refrigerate/article.htmhttp://www.drugs.com/mtm/desmopressin-nasal.html",

            "answer": "Wow, I was in the same situation (only I use the pills, not the nasal spray which I think is safer). I had benign brain tumor removed, and right after that i went to the bathroom every 15 minutes! I've been on this medicine for 16 years only to find out now my endo doesn't think I have diabetes insipidus! He said sometimes it's only temporary that you need the desmopressin after brain surgery, from the trauma. However, I still urinate every 15 minutes, so my urologist told me I have overactive bladder. Im taking vesicare now-starting tonite, ugh. How did you fathers situation turn out?",
