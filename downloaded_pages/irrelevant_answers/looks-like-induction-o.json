I am going to try to do without the epidural, but if it's taking a while and I'm in tremendous pain I will have it.Christie, I had read your post and you didn't have great things to say about that pill. He said he would want it to dilate me enough so he can break my water and go from there. I so hope that's all I need, but at this point, I'll do whatever. It's nice to hear all the good stories about induction. All I've heard is the bad. I will keep you guys posted as to Logan Gage's arrival. Thanks for all the well wishes. And if he decides to make his entrance earlier, I will definitely let you all know. It's amazing to believe that by next week I'll finally get to meet him!Debra :o)",

            "answer": "Juts wanted to wish you the best of luck. I was induced with my baby girl... I was 9 days past due. They didnt induce me with a lil pill. I was already 2cm dilated. So they just started me on pit. But they tried for 2 days and i never got into a good labor pattern. I only went to 2 1/2 cm and 65% thinned out. They babys head never came down at all. So we decided the best thing to do was have a c-section. Because the doc didnt think the babys head would come down so i said ok. And thats what they did. I was relly disappionted that i didnt get to have a natural delivery. But i am just happy to have my beautilful baby girl here with me happpy and healthy.... I wish they would have giving me the pill like they are going to you because it seems like it works better.. One of my friends was induced that way and she did relly great... Just wanted to wish you the best... Let us know how it gos.. Best wishes for an easy labor and delivery...Dawnna",

Either way, I hope you get a bit of enjoyment from the experience.\u00a0\u00a0Overall, it is so awesome, despite the pain and worry.Good Luck(I don't post much anymore - my youngest is six months old)",

    "question": "I saw my dr. this a.m. My cervix is soft, but no dilation yet (I'm 39 weeks). He doesn't feel I will go on my own by my due date (5/30), so with the gestational diabetes, they don't let you go much past your due date. I will be scheduled to go to the hospital either Tues (5/31) or Wed (6/1) to give me a little pill you insert into your vagina that will hopefully enable him to break my water. If not, it's pitocin but he said that's his last resort. I'm a bit disappointed as I had pictured what it would be like to just start having contractions and having it happen naturally, but regardless, I should have him next week and that is exciting and terrifying! Just wanted to keep you all posted.Debra :o)",
