            "answer": "Hi,It is quite possible that your bowel resection is playing a part here, depending on what part was resected. Post-meal relative hypoglycemia can also occur when there is a very brisk insulin rise that is somewhat mismatched to the rise in glucose--not necessarily a disease per se, and can often be helped by eating small mixed meals with a little protein, carb and fat in each meal.\u00a0\u00a0If you ever have very low levels less than 50mg/dL or symptoms of fainting etc, this should be more aggressively addressed to keep you safe. There are also rare syndromes that can cause low blood sugars, and if concerned I think you should seek out an Endocrinologist for further assistance and guidance regarding the right tests to have performed.take care.",

    "question": "Normally blood sugar levels rise after eating.\u00a0\u00a0What causes my blood sugar levels to drop after I eat?\u00a0\u00a0Even if I eat candy or other sugar sweets this happens.\u00a0\u00a0I experience a drop of sometimes 30-40 points.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be a pancreas issue or could this be related to the bowel resectioning I had two years ago? I take no medication for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I was only told by my gp to monitor blood sugar levels after a fasting blood sugar test was over 130.\u00a0\u00a0My A1C level is 4.6.I am a 62 year old female and currently, my health issues are the blood sugar variations, slight hypertension, Gilbert's Syndrome, and elliptocytosis hemolysis.Thank you for your response.",
