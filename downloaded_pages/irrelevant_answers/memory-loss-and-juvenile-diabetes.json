    "question": "I have a teenager who's blood sugar stays pretty well under controll. We have always teased her about not paying attention, but now I am starting to worry. She seems like she is really having long term memory loss. She forgets full on conversations that we have had several weeks back. She gets great grades, but fails her state tests. And no she doesn't freak over tests...she really just acts like she has never seen the information before. I am starting to get really concerned that this might be linked to her diabetes. Is it? What can we do if so?Thank you!",
