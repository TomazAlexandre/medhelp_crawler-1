            "answer": "You're right abt the symptoms resembling menapause. Dr needs toto do hormone ck of FSH & LH to see if you're possibly peri-menapause. Get copies of labs for hm-file to read or comparelater. The Keflex may be causing some of the problems. Anti-biotics many times affect the good stuff that helps heal us.Have you seen a Dermatologist? This skin condition sounds likeit should be treated w/ topical rays/solutions/maybe even alaser light. Sometimes less is more. Use a clean cloth ea. time on your face w/ no rubbing. Splash water & avoid alot of creamsw/ lanolin. Remember the old Noxema? It's still a mild standby.For other dry skin, Lubriderm Seriouly Sensitive is great. Soaksin & free of everthing. Derms. refer it alot but not for yourtype face condition. Later it's gd. for neck/under eye sold OTC.I use daily for arms/hands. Increase water as that will helpsplump tissue cells thru-out. Junk food Is suspect of this cysticacne problem but I think it's more of a fingers to face spread.Bacteria will remain on towels so use hot water for laundry.Stress can also do this but sudden onset does sound like a shiftin hormones. There are natural ways of balancing that alsohelp the thyroid. Do you know if ANA/SSA/SSB/ were also done?Lupus takes awhile to form a picture. I'd real suggest a gd-dermto evaluate so you can feel better abt your skin condition &take 1 thing at a time. Sometimes BC pills need to be loweredor given to balance this too but it's a personal choice. TheDr can also culture these cysts for a better choice therapy.You're dealing w/ an emotional & painful situation so offer moreinfo later. We have plenty helpers. Gd-luck.",

            "answer": "hi EllieYou said you were on Lipitor, why did you stop taking it? I know my partner takes it and has been feeling rather queasy of late, he took it because of diabetes and doctors here believe that a low cholestrol slightly below normal is better for people suffering diabetes but I am not convinced - because his cholestrol was 5 to start with - just normal. however would your symptoms have anything to do with this drug, or the stopping of it? Also Autoimmune disorders are hard to diagnose - I went through probably all your symptoms and more for nearly a year before a routine X ray and subsequent biopsy of the Lung confirmed Sarcoidosis, sometimes a raft of symptoms only complicate - I had doctors telling me I was suffering from hyperventolation Syndrome to Migraine but all those symptoms lead to a systematic disorder, it made perfect sense afterwards!I would suggest a routine work-up, specific blood tests ( Ie; for hormone levels, vitamin levels, tyroid, kidney function etc), chest x-ray.\u00a0\u00a0I would also do some research into side effects of Lipitor on the web. None of us ( of the fairer sex) can rule out the menopause for weird symptoms, I'm only 38 and currently getting checked out for it's arrival!\u00a0\u00a0But not all of us go through menopause to find the symptoms so utterly draining, so this warrants further investigation.\u00a0\u00a0 i would certainly talk to your Doc about nausea after coming off Lipitor it may be related.Hope you feel better soonJ",
