            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum! Hunger pangs with nausea in the morning can be due to severe acidity. These often result in migraine attacks. Omeprazole is a good drug to combat this. Along with it you can try over the counter antacids. However I would recommend you see a doctor and take medication under a doctor\u2019s supervision. Avoid heavy meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal.This could also be due to diabetes causing severe hunger pangs.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I recently woke up in the middle of the night with a gnawing pain in my stomach which I later realised were hunger pangs and extremely painfull ones at that.Later in the day i got a sever migraine.It seems that i'm always hungry and yet eating doesn't seem to really help. Lately I now have nausea in the mornings.I've seen a doctor who prescribed some anti-acid syrup.Any idea of all the 3 related i.e the hunger pangs, migrain and nausea?This has been happening for about 2 weeks now.",
