    "question": "My ACTH test is 53 range 6-50 cortisol is 25 range 6-22 is this considered high? Doc is looking for my bad fatigue problem. Going by rumpled my ACTH test was not done in a chilled tube so am going to have it redone. So far had 24 hour urine high cortisol dexa blood draw high. Also MRI on pituary nothing showed but read rumpled post saying they can be hidden . My doc wants to see disc of MRI don't trust radiologist. Now she wants to do a PET scan full body I guess looking for cancer are my levels high enough to look for cancer? Tonite am doing a midnight saliva test two nights running to test for cortisol. Is all these tests going to show something? Meantime my fatigue is terrible I also have hashimotos and diabetes 2. Thyroid levels are low still trying to get them up could be some of the fatigue.",
