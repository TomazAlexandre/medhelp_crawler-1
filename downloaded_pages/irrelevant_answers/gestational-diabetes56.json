            "answer": "My best friend is 32 weeks and got diagnosed with it at 28 weeks. Even though she has healthy eating habits she hasn't gained a pound throughout her pregnancy. She had an ultrasound last week and her daughter is a bit underweight.\u00a0\u00a0She again met her dietitian and they said she isn't doing anything wrong and just to keep up with her current diet. During that ultrasound they found an issue with blood flow through the cord, she could have been delivering tomorrow but all is looking ok for now but is being monitored closely and still probably needs to deliver a bit early",
