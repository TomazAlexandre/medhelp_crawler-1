            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but frequent urination(polyuria) can be due to diabetes mellitus.Other possibilities are diabetes insipidus,glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection,hypercalcemia,hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism,hyperparathyroidism,diuretic drugs and benign hyperplasia of the prostate(in males).In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography ,prostate specific antigen blood test,thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis.I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Okay So the past few of days I've been peeing almost once every hour at night and frequently but not as often in the day..I went to see my doctor and she kind of rushed me out of there because she was about to go on vacation so i'm still really worried. she told me to get a blood test which will take a week for the resultin the meantime she told me not to drink anything after 6pm...doesn't help at all. I could have told her I already tried that but she was in a hurry to get me out of there..So here I am getting a light achey pain in my back each hour at night,thats the feeling i get when i have to pee, not like the nice tingly feeling it used to be, uncomfortable pain now(it's kind of there all the time now, ) and I should be empty you know because i didnt drink anything after 6...so I go to pee and I pee only a medium small amount or just a little bit! and it takes me like 2 minutes to summon it, you know. and it's just a bit. So my question is while I wait around for doc to get back and blood test results what can I do ?! any special diet?She didn't tell me anything about that, like \"lay off sugar\" or anything and i'm doomed to not get any sleep for a week and im afraid this back pain will get worse and i will just die one of these days :()can i still drink tea and coffee, can i eat sugar stuff?! wtf is going on ...any vitamins I should take to help regenerate body? yesterday i had no sugar at all and I still had same problem at night..I've had a history of sugar abuse, coffee lots of beer, tea with sugar constantly..etc and i smoked a lot of pot up until last month when i quit...what else...my feet are often cold... im small for a man 130 pounds i'm 23..i haven't been able to gain weight for the past 8 or so years, always 130-135-125 lbs...i have pretty greasy skin... fair complexion LOL no prior medical problems I've never been sick before except a runny nose, I jog every now and then....my posture *****, i sit in a chair most of the day..my back is always sore....anyway please? any advice to help me during this week of worrying?",
