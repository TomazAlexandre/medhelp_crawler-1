            "answer": "Hi,The accepted way to determine if you have Type 1 diabetes is to do antibody testing(anti-GAD and Anti-islet cell antibodies) as well as check for c-peptide levels. There are some people who are antibody negative and still have type 1, but that is not common.Autoimmune diseases can cluster together, so the arthritic problems could be related if you have Type 1. Pheochromocytomas are not autoimmune though.Keep up with your doctor and keep checking your blood sugars to make sure everything is okay as you change medications around.take care.",

I ate meatloaf and 1/4 cup mashed potatoes and a salad. And in the evening a few spoonfuls of peanutbutter. This am it went down to 135 in 3 hrs and 117 in 4 1/2. I have been having higher numbers in the am for quite a while, but not as high as today. Valley Fever is a Autoimmune Disease also right? I have a nodule in my right lung and I had 3 testing for the Valley fever to see if it was live 2 said yes. Does having Rheumatic fever as a teen, weaken your immune system to Give u type 1, and MVP and Psorisis/psoritic artharitis and Vally fever. Does getting the possible type on under control help my Immune system? And could this Psoritic arthritis be Rheumatiod athritis? I have been in alot of pain, my spind, my elbow.",

    "question": "I went to the new dr. yesterday, And this new Dr. said I have 4 autoimmune Diseases and he believes I am a type a 1 Diabetic. He said when I was 14 I most likely had Rumatic fever from the strep infection based on the story of my chilhood. He ran hearing test on me, he said my ear drumbs are scared from the Psorisis. And he did a EKG, and another heart test, and a blood flow test in my legs. He said tomorrow for me to come in for blood work and he said he is doing a c-peptide test and other hormone tests and alot more of tests. He is going to have me have a heart scan to see if this Mitral Valve prolapse that the other Dr. have called a heart murmer is actually the valve hardening from the Rheumatic Fever. He said not to take the Byetta, and he wasn't going to give me any pills to bandaid the problems. He said he will get to the bottom of this. I was suprised when I went into this place there are Crosses and Jesus Ice sculputres, and the Dr. after asking to here the story of how I got all this disease, he was standing with his eyes closed and hands in a praying position. But anyway I really liked him. Is it a wise choice to believe that with this cluster of autoimmune problems, the young 89lb post strep infection diagnoses of diabetes, and psorisis/ psordic arthiritis/joint swelling, and adrenal tumor/loss of it(Pheochromocytoma) and Valley Fever/lung Nodule, that this diabetes is different than type 2 and is really Type 1 ?",
