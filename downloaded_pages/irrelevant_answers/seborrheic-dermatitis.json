            "answer": "Hi,Seborrhoeic eczema (also Seborrheic dermatitis AmE, seborrhea) is a skin disorder affecting the scalp, face, and trunk causing scaly, flaky, itchy, red skin. It particularly affects the sebum-gland rich areas of skin.Soaps and detergents such as sodium laureth sulfate may precipitate a flare-up, as they strip moisture from the top layers of the skin, and the drying property of these can cause flare-ups and may worsen the condition.Avoid using these and choose a suitable alternative for cleansing the skin.Or it could just be xerosis.Xerosis is the medical term for dry skin. It can have many different causes, including general dehydration, Vitamin A deficiency, and diabetes.ref:wikipediaHIV has other manifestations too, so it is unlikely in your case.For your satisfaction you could take tests for it.",
