            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.If your EEG was abnormal, this does not always mean epilepsy. Abnormal EEG has to be clinically co-related. Abnormal EEG is seen in tumors, sleep disorders, epilepsies, inflammation of brain, migraines, head injury, alcohol abuse, attention problems etc. Hence take another opinion and if need be a MRI of brain will need to be done.Also consult a gynecologist. In your case tingling can also be a symptom of menopause. Hence get complete hormone panel with FSH, LH, estrogen, progesterone and prolactin.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
