            "answer": "Well - I have used the Windsor Pilates for quite some time now.\u00a0\u00a0It helps me stay away from those moments where \"cheating\" seems okay and also helps to keep me feeling active during the day and evening times.The weight loss/gain really depends upon your work structure and the foods/frequency/amount your eating.I think with each meal I eat because I am a type 1 diabetic that I should only be eating about half of what other people eat.\u00a0\u00a0I wait through about 10 minutes of total dissatisfaction of what I just ate and then the feeling of fullness starts to take effect.\u00a0\u00a0While everyone else is feeling sick because they ate too much, I feel just right and am ready to rock and roll.I dont know if this helps at all.Keep up the exercise and remember that as a fellow diabetic I know how hard it is to not cheat, but everynow and then we can have a little something.",

    "question": "Hello again everone.Recently I ordered the Winsor Pilates DVDs. Although I have not yet received it, I would deeply appreciate some insight on persons who have tried this type of exercise.In the past couple weeks I've become lethargic, have not been running as often as I usually do as well as cheating on my diabetes. Consequently, I've gained about 6 pounds and I'm finally ready to get back to my orignal fitness level and stay in control.Does Winsor Pilates really take the inches off the tummy? As a type 2 I always focus on keeping my tummy trim. I intend to couple it along with running. How effective is it?Big thanks in advance for your time guys :)God Bless.",
