When we got to the hospital they didnt want to tell us how bad it was and had me push her instead of c section and she passed away during birth.Go to different doctors, get second opinions, be persistent about knowing exactly how severe it is. Monitor yourself, get a journal and write how your body fees,, there where signs with me and I wish id listened to my body vs my doctors.While you might be in the clear which I hope you and yoyr bundle of love are- be preparrd for anything. Try not to stress and focus on good prenatal care.",

            "answer": "Thank you for replying.. I'm already a high risk because of diabetes and at 16 weeks they did an ultrasound at the maternal fetal medicine with the high risk obgyn... He said everything looked good .. Then I get this stupid test done and I get a positive marker for ntd it came back as 2.50 and the cut off IS 2.50... If I would have gotten a 2.49 then it would have been negative... I'm just wondering if it was something big wouldn't he have seen it then?",

They got me into a specialist\u00a0\u00a0within 2 days and I had a level 2 ultrasound done. The baby looks absolutely perfect. Spine looked great, brain and tummy looked perfect. Everything measured right on. I do have a cyst on my placenta and they think maybe that could have given the high numbers. Stay positive :-)",
