            "answer": "Hello Tookie's Mom,I am one of the volunteers here.\u00a0\u00a0I am NOT a medical professional, so my advice is based on my experience in caring for my son, now 10 who was diagnosed at the age of 3.\u00a0\u00a0My sister is also type 1 (diagnosed 2 years before my son) - when she was 24, she is now 33.Has your son been testing for ketones when his BG is above 250?***Also, I am almost 100% Positive that a \"zero to low carb diet\" is not healthy and potentially dangerous for type 1 diabetics.Another thing...although we have all been told that exercise (physical activity) can lower the blood sugar, if a diabetic has high blood sugar and then exercises, the blood sugar can actually go higher.\u00a0\u00a0It is most likely an individual thing.\u00a0\u00a0If my son's BG is 350 or higher, I do not allow him to exercise (ride his bike, run around, whatever) until his BG goes down.\u00a0\u00a0Also, he always tests for ketones if his BG is above 250.\u00a0\u00a0My son's Endocrinologist had always told us that if Charlie had moderate or higher ketones to give him 1 - 1.5 extra units of humalog.\u00a0\u00a0I am NOT telling you to do this.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that this method has always worked for us to get rid of ketones.I have another comment.\u00a0\u00a0There is something called the \"honeymoon phase\".\u00a0\u00a0I have read that it can last up to 18 months.\u00a0\u00a0(If anyone has different info, please post)\u00a0\u00a0In the honeymoon phase, the pancreas is still making insulin, so you might see a lot of good numbers.***I found the information below while searching on the Internet.\"I was told that Atkins diet was dangerous to diabetics ?This diet can be extremely dangerous to Type I diabetics, but can actually help Type II diabetics by helping regulate insulin levels. Many diabetics have been able to reduce, or even eliminate their medication. Check with your doctor before starting this diet, and before reducing any medications.\"What comes to my mind is to:1) Stop having your son on a zero-low carb diet IMMEDIATELY2) Make an appointment with his Endocrinologist3) Have him keep a log of his blood sugars, so the doc and you and your son can see if there is a pattern4) Ask his doctor above what BG reading should your son NOT exercise5) Possibly ask his doc about having him see or get referred to a Nutritionist/Dietician6) Test for ketones if above 250 (Not saying he is not doing so already)It was difficult for me to understand the time frame.\u00a0\u00a0How long ago was he admitted to the hospital?We can have weeks of great BG's and then BOOM they are wacko.\u00a0\u00a0My son is only 10 and growing, so his insulin demand will always be changing.I do have to mention that after 6-1/2 yrs. of shots, my son went on the insulin pump last August and we love it!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Just something to think about.\u00a0\u00a0It allows my son to be a lot more flexible as to how many carbs he eats and when, whereas on shots, we had a strict amount of carbs he was allowed per meal and per snack.Please keep us posted!",

            "answer": "Hello again,I have to comment on the diet portion of your question.I do not think there is anything wrong with low carb \"MEALS\" for a type 1 diabetic, but a Zero to Low Carb \"DIET\" might not be a good idea for a person living with type 1.Please seek advice from your son's Endocrinologist.As I stated yesterday, it sounds like he had been in the \"honeymoon phase\".",

            "answer": "Could high levels of testosterone could also be an issue? Testosterone apparently causes insulin resistance, resulting in high blood sugars. I know of a 16 year old who is on 160 units of insulin a day. According to his mother, it is because of testosterone induced insulin resistance.Mark",

    "question": "My son is 16 years old and diagnosed with type I diabetes two years ago. Every since he has been diagnosed he has low blood sugars or within the normal range despite the amount of food he eats. He was on 2 units of NPH, and no Humalog insulin.\u00a0\u00a0An outpatient boost test was done to test him for type 2 diabetes, confirmed as type 1. This day, she requested that he be taken off insulin. He was off insulin for two days with two numbers in the 200s and the rest within the normal range. His doctor was concerned about the lows and the limited amount of insulin he required so she requested that he be admitted to the hospital. In the hospital, three days after taking the boost test, he was given another glucagon test. Prior to checking into the hospital he was at 75. After checking in his numbers grew between 293 to 494. When released from the hospital, his numbers were between the high 200s to low 300s. His endocrinologist increased his NPH & Humalog to 5 units each. However, we can't get his numbers down. At home, I have him on a zero to low carb diet and his numbers are just high. Everything he eats runs up his numbers. He's going to the gym for about two hours doing cardio & weightlifting. He was doing fine prior to hospitalization and could eat as much sugar free to low suger <4 foods he wanted. He had no complications and led a normal life. What could be the problem? It's like his pancreas doesn't know what to do. Has anyone else experienced this type of problem?",
