He could also benefit by attending AA or Narcanon meeting as well.\u00a0\u00a0The booze significantly raises sugar levels, I live with a diabetic and know this first hand.\u00a0\u00a0He has to take the first steps in maintaining a healthy lifestyle.\u00a0\u00a0It's very hard watching someone abuse themselves on a regular basis and know there is nothing you can do.\u00a0\u00a0Stay strong - get some support - knowledge is power.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully, between the information you and your doctors can provide, it will be enough motivation for him to change.Trinity",

            "answer": "\" as a 3/4 it should not be a reason to avoid treatment in itself. Especially, if tx withhold further liver damage.Uncontrolled diabetes with blood sugars of 350 is certainly a good reason not to treat since the tx can make it go even higher.\u00a0\u00a0(and if you add the fact that he's using crack cocaine and drinking, I would say he doesn't have much chance of SVR).A fasting blood sugar of >100 decreases SVR....and Insulin resistance results in HYPERINSULINEMIA.....which can make the interferon ineffective.World J Gastroenterol. 2006 Nov 28Insulin resistance and hepatitis C.Insulin resistance is the major feature of the metabolic syndrome and depends on insulin secretion and insulin sensitivity. In chronic hepatitis C, insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus are more often seen than in healthy controls or chronic hepatitis B patients. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection promotes insulin resistance, mainly by increased TNF production together with enhancement of suppressor of cytokine (SOC-3); both events block PI3K and Akt phosphorylation. Two types of insulin resistance could be found in chronic hepatitis C patients: \"viral\" and \"metabolic\" insulin resistance. Insulin resistance in chronic hepatitis C is relevant because it promotes steatosis and fibrosis. The mechanisms by which insulin resistance promotes fibrosis progression include: (1) steatosis, (2) hyperleptinemia, (3) increased TNF production, (4) impaired expression of PPARgamma receptors. Lastly, insulin resistance has been found as a common denominator in patients difficult-to-treat like cirrhotics, overweight, HIV coinfected and Afro-American. Insulin resistance together with fibrosis and genotype has been found to be independently associated with impaired response rate to peginterferon plus ribavirin. Indeed, in genotype 1, the sustained response rate was twice (60%) in patients with HOMA\u00a0\u00a02. In experiments carried out on Huh-7 cells transfected by full length HCVRNA, interferon alpha blocks HCV replication. However, WHEN INSULIN (at doses of 128 microU/mL, similar that seen in the hyperinsulinemic state) WAS ADDED TO INTERFERON, THE ABILITY TO BLOCK HCV REPLICATION DISAPPEARED, and the PKR synthesis was abolished. In summary, hepatitis C promotes insulin resistance and INSULIN RESISTANCE INDUCES INTERFERON RESISTANCE, steatosis and fibrosis progression.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17131467?ordinalpos=14&itool=EntrezSystem2.PEntrez.Pubmed.Pubmed_ResultsPanel.Pubmed_RVDocSum\"Other measures can be taken to enhance svr probabilities in the the face of negative predictors.\"Like what?",
