            "answer": "Yeah, I totally understand. I'm nervous all the time about is my baby ok, if he's not moving a lot or something like that. Even though I know the movements get less and less towards the end. Mine is partly because I had my first son at 36 weeks and he was in the nicu for 21 days. It was scary and definitely not how I wanted my first delivery to go. But he actually did really good. Most of the time he was in there we were just waiting on him to be able to regulate his body temperature on its own. All nicu babies have to be able to do that before they can be sent home. His lungs weren't fully developed at birth and that's why he had to be in to begin with, bit after a week he was breathing on his own perfectly. So it wasn't that bad. But I'm nervous now because my doc thinks I will have this one at 34 weeks, I'm already 1.5 and 50% effaced and if i keep going at this rate it won't be too long. But thankfully, I got a shot for the baby's lungs so maybe he won't have to be in the hospital that ling if at all. Sorry I kinda babbled LOL",

            "answer": "Not to rain on your parade or anything but its normal to not have another sonogram after 20 weeks if you're having a healthy pregnancy and your doctor doesn't think you're too big or small for your due date. Every pregnancy is different. The same doctor could do things completely different with you than they did with someone else. They usually tell you if you're going to have a sonogram. Just don't count your chickens before they hatch, I don't want you to be disappointed.",

Well my question is would they be able to tell if anything was wrong with my baby at my last sonogram? Like physical and mental? I had a specialist do my 20 week scan so i wont be surprised with anything tomorrow other than how much he has grown? Im sure everything is great im just worrying cause I'm a ftm and havent seen him in a long time.",
