            "answer": "Some, but not all, pills can be crushed and taken in say, applesauce. A pharmacist should be consulted as some long acting medications cannot be crushed as they will act differently and not in a good way. Some meds, like thyroid, need to be taken fasting, optimally so this is not a great option, but if you are consistent, at least you can adjust the dose for not taking it properly. You have to discuss that with your doctor as well.Some meds are available in other formats. Cortisol though is an IM shot - AKA long needle to get into a muscle, not a sub-cu, short needle like diabetes.You can also talk to your doctor about your swallowing issues. You may need some therapy (as in physical therapy) to help. It may also signal an issue - like myasthenia gravis. When my MG acts up, I cannot swallow and I choke, even on saliva.",
