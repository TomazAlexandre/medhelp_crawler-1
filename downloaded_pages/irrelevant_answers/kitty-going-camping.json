            "answer": "will you be in a trailer or somewhere secure for kitty so he won't get out and lost?make sure to have a travel cage along too so kitty has a safe place to tuck himself into and use when necessary for safety.bring along familiar things such as bedding, toys, dishes. new surroundings can be very stressful.also be sure to not keep kitty in a hot trailer or vehicle...keep him cool and comfortable and safe is about all I can really recommend to you.good for you for looking after your boy with this life altering illness, to be available 2x a day for injections is a real commitment....I love the name Simba.Please let us know how the trip goes for Simba and the family. best of luck",

Every summer my family goes out for a camping trip and I cannot leave Simba at home this year because of his diabetes.
