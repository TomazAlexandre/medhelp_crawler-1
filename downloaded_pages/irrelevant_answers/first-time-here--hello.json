            "answer": "Hello,the dietician may have told you to eat lots of carbs.\u00a0\u00a0This is the typical approach.\u00a0\u00a0However, if you eat less carbs (and those you do eat should be from veges and dairy, and some fruits / complex and mostly unprocessed carbs).I had 2 successful diabetic pregnancies (on insulin) using low carb approach.\u00a0\u00a0I found if I ate the amount of carbs they wanted me to (about 240 g/day), I would have gained an unreasonable amount of weight and also I would have had great trouble controlling blood sugars.Most important in pregnancy is to control blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0This is more important than eating lots of carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Focus instead on meats, eggs, unsweetened, diary, protein, and low carb veges. Eat unprocessed fats (ie. cream, avocado, nuts, etc) for extra calories if you need them.Your insulin will need to be increased to control your blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0The dose of\u00a0\u00a0insulin can also increase a lot during the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I went from about 20 units / day at the beginning to nearly 100 units/day at the end.",
