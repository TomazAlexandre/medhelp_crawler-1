            "answer": "Larry, I would recommend that you make an appointment with a diabetes educator so he/she can watch your technique, injection sites, etc. as I never heard of these problems with Lantus.\u00a0\u00a0Lantus is a 24 hour basal insulin that starts to work in an hour after injected and lasts most of the day without peaking.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I have never heard of a Lantus pen but have a call into our local rep to ask. My teenage son has Type 1 diabetes and there is never a dull moment with diabetes, is there.\u00a0\u00a0Carol",

            "answer": "Larry:I'm not sure if you live outside of the USA, but my understanding is that Lantus is NOT available for use in a pen here in the US. My daughter just switched to Lantus via syringe & Novolog via pen after 8 years on an insulin pump. Her diabetes educator just gave her the Lantus prescription 3 days ago & said it is not available in any other form. I have read that outside the USA, however, it is sold in pen format.RegardsRmhb",

            "answer": "Larry,Thanks for sharing that precaution.\u00a0\u00a0I'm using a pump but know lotsa folks who are Lantus users and I'm not certain they knew about the precaution either.\u00a0\u00a0(I passed along the Lantus.com website info to them)The folks I know who are using it, however, are very pleased with what they call \"rock steady\" basal coverage.\u00a0\u00a0After an experience like yours, however, I'd also be more cautious about using it again unless I'd \"pull back\" to check that I was really shooting into fat.Are you getting pretty good results with NPH?I'm also a long time DMer, but you have me beat by about 5 years.\u00a0\u00a0I'm amazed at how far we've progressed since the \"old days\" and am in awe of how many of us even survived without the ability to do home BG tests for the first many years of our disease.\u00a0\u00a0I know this wasn't the topic of your concern, but I couldn't resist comparing notes with another long-timer.Good luck and I hope you'll read & contribute here again.",

            "answer": "A quote from the Lantus web site www.lantus.com (Lantus Prescribing information). Something my physician neglected to tell me, by the way.PRECAUTIONSGeneral:LANTUS is not intended for intravenous administration. The prolonged duration of activity of insulin glargine is dependent on injection into subcutaneous tissue. Intravenous administration of the usual subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycemia.Be careful",

I find NPH plus an extre evening\u00a0\u00a0Humalog inhjection (4 per day) works best. I have considered a pump, but 5 injections probably give me the same coverage, and are more convienient.On another note, I am thinking of starting a disbetes support group in my area for long time type 1 diabetics. I would like to hear from anyone else who may have experience with such a group. We have had a different experience than the type 2 diabetics our age.If you have access to my email address, please feel free to contact me that way.Larry",

            "answer": "I've been a Type I for 29 yrs. I started using Lantus about 3 yrs. ago and have had absolutely no problems w/ it.Only once was ther a problem, and it was my fault: Since both the Lantus and the fast actings are clear, I accidentally gave myself a Lantus-amount of Humalog! Well, if nothing else, it was a damn good exuse to eat candy for the next hour! Could you have done this by mistake?\u00a0\u00a0Also, I talked to my MD who is the Medical Director of the Joslin Clinic in my town, and he said that Lantus still works for 24 hrs. even when given IV, though it probably does start sooner than the usual 1 hour, the strength is the same. I have been in the hospital 100's of time w/ Gastroparesis and take everything\u00a0\u00a0IV, even my insulins. No problems like yours so far\u00a0\u00a0Kristin",

    "question": "I saw a recent thread about Lantis in\u00a0\u00a0a pen and I would like to ask if anyone else shares my concern about this or the overall safty of Lantis.I have been a diabetic 40 years (Type 1), and started on Lantis about a year ago, replacing NPH for my basal insulin (I also take Humalog with a pen). I injected Lantis with a syringe, and as I never had a problem with NPH when it sometimes entered a vessel, I did not draw back before injecting.The result, when I hit a vessel in my leg, was a drop in blood suger from 180 to 30 in 1/2 hour! I consumed about 48 ounces of orange juces and 2 bars of chocolate in 15 minutes just to stay conscious! My wife was in a panic. I had never gone into insulin shock or been below 50 mg/dl in my life before this.The concern: The pen does allow drawing air to insure the Lantis is not injected into a vessel. It should NEVER be used without this precaution. i.e. A PEN IS UNSAFE WITH THIS INSULIN!B.T.W. I no longer trust or take Lantis, as it relies on forming crystals under the skin to prevent immediate release of the entire dose, and I consider it dangerous for regular use.",
