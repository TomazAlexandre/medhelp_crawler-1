            "answer": "Hi,your fasting number of over 100 does bear watching, but is not yet alarming.\u00a0\u00a0Given your family history, checking of hba1c (average 3 month blood sugar) would be warranted, and likely should be repeated every 6 months or so to monitor the situation.Truly normal fasting is < 95, and typically in the low 80s.Continuing with your active lifestyle, and adopting a lower carb way of eating will be beneficial.You may wish to get a home blood sugar meter and monitor after carby meals from time to time to be sure your numbers are not too high / rising over time.\u00a0\u00a0 pre and post eating numbers are ideally similar if one is non-diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Numbers consistently\u00a0\u00a0higher than 125 would be cause for further investigation / and changing diet / consideration of meds.Please come back and let us know your hba1c numbers, and how you are going.",

    "question": "About a year ago during routine blood work, my fasting glucose result was found to be 102. My doctor (an endocrinologist I see for my thyroid disorder) was concerned and ordered A1C and C-Peptide tests along with another fasting glucose test. All came back normal a few weeks later (A1C 5.1, fasting glucose 92). An additional fasting glucose test a few months later was normal at 94. Just a few days ago, I got another blood test and my fasting glucose was back up to 101. So in the past year, my results have been 102, 92, 94, and 101. I am 34 years old, very athletic, and not overweight at all. I am concerned about diabetes because both my aunt and uncle on my mother's side had type 1 diabetes, though my mother did not. Should I be concerned about the latest 101 result? Could it be that I just ate something that caused a spike? I fasted for 12 hours before the test, but did eat a large meal with a lot of carbs and some soda. Could stress also cause this result? I have been experiencing a lot of anxiety recently. I see my doctor in a few weeks, but wanted to get some other thoughts.",
