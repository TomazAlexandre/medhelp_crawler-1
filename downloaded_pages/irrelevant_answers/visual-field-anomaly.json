            "answer": "You should have it investigated.It sounds to me more ophthalmological, so a visit first to an ophthalmologist would be in order - maybe from a problem in the cornea (like a cataract) or a retina problem. They can also assess the likeliehood of a neurological problem as they also look at visual fields and the optic nerve. It is more likely ophtho related in only present in one eye, although this does not exclude optic nerve disease.Good luck",

            "answer": "I have been reading the neurology/neurosurgery posts with a growing sense of disbelief. Things have certainly changed in the 13 years since my trans-spenoidal surgery on a subarachnoid cyst at Cleveland Clinic. I am surprised that you would automatically discount visual anomalies, since they can be a sign of optic chiasm displacement. An opthamologist is a good idea, but what about other symptoms? Headaches, body weakness, diabetes insipidus from pressure, inability to control body temperature because of the pituitary/hypothalmus displacement? What about an endocrinologist to test cortisol levels? Do you sincerely believe that because arachnoid cysts/subarachnoid cysts are often found by accident that they are harmless?? I had fenestration surgery again in 2005. They found scarring on my optic nerve. I have reduced visual acuity. I have diabetes insipidus, generalized weakness, and constant headache. My subAC is in the suprasellar region, displacing both optic chiasm and pituitary, and wraps around my right carotid. My neurosurgeon here takes ACs very seriously.",

    "question": "Dear Dr, in the past year I have noticed some things in my vision. A basic description is when I'm outside I will see in the distance a pulse of light like a signal mirror, it comes on and goes off in a split second.\u00a0\u00a0I see it in the distance when I look up.\u00a0\u00a0The other thing is what looks like a small dark shape moving along, again just a split second.\u00a0\u00a0At first I just about jumped off the chair as I thought it was a spider or something.\u00a0\u00a0It is normally something I see at night while just siting watching tv.\u00a0\u00a0It is more to the perphery of my visual field.\u00a0\u00a0Once it was centered and it was about the size of a fist sliding along the top of a chair about 10 feet in front of me.\u00a0\u00a0There is no pain or migrain at these times, I have had an op at young age to fix a squint.\u00a0\u00a0Im a healthy 38 yo male.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound nuerologic or opthalmic? Should it be investigated.Thanks",
