            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is difficult to comment really without examination. Excess alcohol intake, partial seizures, diabetes, spinal nerve compression high up and low calcium levels all cause head and tongue tingling. Wisdom tooth is another cause. Tingling, calf pain, dizziness etc that come and go can be due to low calcium. Get this tested and if this is low, parathyroid gland function and Vit D level will have to be tested. Tingling in tongue can be due to gastric reflux with acid coming and hitting at a point. It can even be due to low Vit B12.Yes, menopause can cause tingling tongue syndrome and it is often refractory to any hormone replacement therapy. Antidepressants and antianxiety drugs such as nortryptiline and clonazepam are found to treat such tingling tongue or tingling mouth syndromes caused by menopause. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",
