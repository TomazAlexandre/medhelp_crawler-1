Get all of their medical records from all the doctors and get the paperwork.\u00a0\u00a0Its a lot of work but worth every bit of it.\u00a0\u00a0Medicaid pays deductibles and out of pocket.\u00a0\u00a0It also pays for most of her meds.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it works out for you, it is stressful enough with having a kid with diabetes without worrying about the medical expense of saving his life. Good luck!",

How can they do that to someone who has no paycheck to live by and no way to get the meds that our health demands? Do you realize how much the infusion sets and resiovoirs cost??? I ask them.... only to hear them say \"Thats not our problem.\" Please ask your doctors for as many samples form thier offices as they can give and explain to them what is going on. I know for a fact they can help by writting letters to social services about the costs and the fact that you need this for your child.",
