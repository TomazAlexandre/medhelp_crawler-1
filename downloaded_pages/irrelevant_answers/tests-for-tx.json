            "answer": "Hi Cindy,They are looking for macular degeneration and signs of diabetes. The cataract shouldn't interfere with treatment. One of the rarer side effects is blindness from retinal detachment or accelerated mac degeneration. If you have an underlying medical condition that hasn't \"blossomed\" yet, the Hep C treatment may accelerate the process and make it full-blown. (This includes thyroid issues, premenopause, and arthritis.) This is why the detection for heart, psych, autoimmune, and GI issues are so important prior to launching the treatment. Also recommended is getting dental work done and addressing issues that may \"go bad\" if your immune system is unable to fight off infection. -I had my gall bladder out prior to txing because it had been full of stones for years and the added strain on my liver could have prevented successful response (or worse, it could have become obstructed during treatment requiring surgery then. -Not something you want to happen when you are anemic and your white blood cells are in the toilet...) :) ~MM",

            "answer": "Losing my vision was probably my worst fear of tx. I developed some floaters during tx, but they disappeared after I was done. Pre tx eye exam showed beginnings of cataracts like you, but no problem launching into tx. Post tx eye exam showed no worsening of eyesight, thank goodness!",

            "answer": "This is from the Schering-Plough (now Merck) prescribing info sheet, Cindy:~~~~~~~~~~~~Ophthalmologic disordersDecrease or loss of vision, retinopathy including macular edema, retinal artery or vein thrombosis, retinal hemorrhages and cotton wool spots, optic neuritis, and papilledema may be induced or aggravated by treatment with peg-intron alpha 2b or other alpha interferons. All patients should receive an eye examination at baseline. Patients with preexisting disorders (e.g. diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy) should receive periodic ophthalmologic exams during interferon alpha treatment. Any patient who develops ocular symptoms should receive a prompt and complete eye examination. Pegintron alpha 2b should be discontinued in patients who develop new or worsening ophthalmologic disorders.www.spfiles.com/pipeg-intron.pdf~~~~~~~~~~~~~~--Bill",
