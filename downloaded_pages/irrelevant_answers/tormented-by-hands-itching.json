            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Dry skin is the commonest cause of itching. Applying a moisturizer and using only soaps that are gentle on the skin is helpful in this case (as you also find). Hypothyroidism too causes dry skin. Please get your thyroid function checked. It could also be due to overuse of AC and heaters.\u00a0\u00a0If you have blisters and dry skin then you need to rule out certain conditions such as diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",

    "question": "Moved to Ga from Fl 3 yrs ago don't know if that has any thing to do with my problem or not, my allergies are twice as bad here. I went to an allergist had all the test done no food allergies just lots of out side stuff. My hands have been itching severely, mostly they start at night. They are dry but it's beyond dryness causing this,what has helped is that I use vasoline to coat my hands and I where white moisturizing gloves and sleep in them, but they will even itch after treatment some times when they are soft and moist. I itch to the point that I tear my skin and my hand embarrass me running real hot water does relieve the itch for short and some times long periods of time. The itching usually always starts at night hardly ever during the day.Sometimes I get tiny what looks like water blisters it's hard to tell because they are so little.I noticed that when I have to take predisone for my asthma my hands get better. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Blessings and Thanks",
