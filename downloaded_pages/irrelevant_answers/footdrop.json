            "answer": "Hi.It would somehow depend on whether you mean an unruptured brain aneurysm or a ruptured brain aneurysm. Persons with an unruptured aneurysm typically do not exhibit symptoms, which is why the diagnosis is hardly ever made until after the aneurysm ruptures.A ruptured aneurysm, on the other hand, is related to symptoms of sudden onset of a severe headache, nausea, vomiting, stiff neck, and a transient loss of vision or consciousness.\u00a0\u00a0In some cases, foot drop can also occur.Foot drop, however, can also be caused by other conditions, such as spinal cord injury, spinal stenosis, diabetes, Parkinson's disease, etc.You should consult a neurologist to have your husband's symptoms assessed.Hope this helps.",

The causes are further classified into anatomic, muscular and neurological.Neurologic causes of foot drop include mononeuropathies of the deep peroneal, common peroneal, or sciatic nerves, Lumbosacral plexopathy among others.An aneurysms which he suffered earlier can cause, but only if it has ruptured.A\u00a0\u00a0CT scan will definitely help in evaluating the condition.A visit to orthopaedicain and physiotherapist will help.Hope this helps.Bye.",

            "answer": "Hi,It could be an coincidence for both aneuyrsm and\u00a0\u00a0 foot drop to appear in succession.Foot drop is\u00a0\u00a0 known to occur when dorsiflexion is affected due to muscle involvement primarily or secondary to nerve involvement.Aneuyrsm to cause such a condition is rare. Possibility can arise provided an embolism as occurred from the clots with the aneuyrsmal sac.Have\u00a0\u00a0an appointment with your medical officer",

            "answer": "Hi,From your last post, it looks like the foot drop was not caused by the ruptured\u00a0\u00a0aneuyrsm in the cranial cavity. In this case, regarding foot drop a local pathology can be considered. Hence a thorough clinical evaluation is needed.If there is a compression on the nerve, the cause must be found. If there was some trauma, then nerve injury shall be considered. In case of nerve injury , recovery depends upon the severity of nerve injury.In case of no recovery and no cause found out, secondary reconstructions are possible i.e tendon transfers.",
