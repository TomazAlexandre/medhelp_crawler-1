            "answer": "lol...you'll probably get over it soon. I thought my crazy cravings were going to last forever, but eventually your body will allow to eat better. My midwife told me not to eat anything that would make me sick or looked like it would make me sick. She said the baby would get what (s)he needs during that time. Just make sure you drinking plenty of water! Although in the beginning I couldn't drink water to save my life. I just drank iced tea and juice and watered them down.",

My midwife actually told me if you have a history of diabetes in your family, there is a chance you can have it. She even told me that if you get it while pregnant, and then it goes away after the pregnancy, chances are, later in life you will have it anyway. I thought that was kinda interesting.",

            "answer": "I feel the same way as you... what actually worked for me was when I would get the cravings for Starburst or Sour Patch Kids or Skittles, I would try something healthier but with the same kick as the sour candies. In my local grocery store they have an organic section and they have these smooshed fruit snacks called Frutabu. They are actually delicious and have a nice sour tart taste to them. Since they are just smooshed fruit it's basically like eating a piece of fruit plus you avoid all the added sugars. I also found that tart fruits and juices work for me. I will snack on a naval orange or drink lots of OJ. Hopefully these suggestions will work for you.",
