            "answer": "Hello,These ticks or tingling sensations that you are having are parasthesias. Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. Are you a diabetic or do you take alcohol? Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism.They can also occur in peripheral artery disease, Peripheral nerve trauma, Peripheral nerve compression or in neurological conditions like multiple sclerosis,motor neuron disease,TIA and autoimmune disorder like lupus.Firstly, I\u2019ll request you to get your blood sugar/HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin) tested to rule out Diabetes mellitus. You may also need tests like thyroid hormone levels,CT head and Nerve Conduction Velocity etc.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Take care and do keep us posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the advice kindd. I went to the nuerologist tuesday and he did a series of testing and told me he didn't think it was anything to do with my nerve endings, however he did mention this parasthesia. To make a long story short, he thought that he was stress related and told me to take xanax 3 times a day and after a month, if that didn't help, he would put me on nuerontin. I use to have migranes and I know this stuff didn't do anything for my headaches, but this is a different thing. I am not a diabectic for sure and I very seldom drink. The tingling is in my face is not painful, just very annoying and constant. I also have been to a dentist and to a ob/gyn to make sure it wasn't my teeth or jaw or menopause before I went to this neurologist. I appreciate anymore suggestions you may have. You sound like you know what you are talking about.Babe",

            "answer": "Hello,Sometimes these tingling sensations are due to vit B12 deficiency.Take vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.Other possibility which is high is multiple sclerosis.It is an autoimmune condition in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system (CNS), leading to demyelination.Diagnosis is tough and confirmed by MRI.Pls discuss these possibilities with your physician and get yourself investigated to rule them out and reach a diagnosis.Hope it helps. Take care and pls do keep us posted if you want any more information.",

    "question": "For about 2 years I have had this tingling in my face, tounge, and lips. I don't know if it's related to the migranes I use to have about 5 years ago, but it's getting in the way of my everyday life. I need help with understanding what it could be and what to do about it. I take blood pressure meds but my m.d. doesn't think that's the problem. Some thinks it anxiety. I'm not nervous and there is no pain. My face just winds me up and makes me anxious.Any suggestions?",
