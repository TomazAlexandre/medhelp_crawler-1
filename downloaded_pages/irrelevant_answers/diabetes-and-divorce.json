Those of us who work on this web forum do not know you and of course cannot make any kinds of comments about your emotional and physical health on this web site, but if you feel that you are being unfairly characterized, I would strongly suggest asking your doctor to give a statement about your actual condition. His statement would be considered more factual than any defense you give on your own behalf.",

The fact is through the highly emotional period of separation and divorce I have cried sometimes when I am alone with my kids and twice this occurred during low glucose levels with one of the times my older boy got me food, ice cream.\u00a0\u00a0(The other time I got food myself.) We were at Cedar Point and I was waiting for the ride with them when my glucose was going down at the same time I realized that the last time we were here as a family which got me sad.I believe Ineed help with suggestions other than the my drs. on ways diabetics in my divorce situation have defended them selves from the thought that their disease makes them not able to do the things they want to do and know they can do?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!\u00a0\u00a0blm4fun",

            "answer": "i am a divorced parent of a 5 yearold type 1 diabetic. my son developed this condition after the divorce so their are no agreements having to do with this condition. My ex was absent and violent and now is back involved in our sons life. He was only able to see him with me present. Our son has major behavior problems from this volitol relationship we had, and he is now threatining to take him alone. He hasnt even been to a diabeties class and I am so afraid that he will try to take him on his weekend. I am scared of him and deathly scared for my son. Right now I dont have money to take him to court, and he is loaded. If anyone out there has any advice or has ever been in this position please respond. I am at a loss and am not sure where to turn.",
