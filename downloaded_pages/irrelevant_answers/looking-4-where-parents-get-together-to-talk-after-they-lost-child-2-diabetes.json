            "answer": "firstly, thanks for responding.My daughter was/is 13 yrs old. She was type 1 diabetic since she was 5 yrs old. She loved to do so many things, a typical teen. She had moved in with her dad late last year, so it has been difficult to keep up with her. She loved to go swimming, read and write peotry, draw, spend time with her friends and her kittens, she loved to shop, talk on the phone, use her computer. She was about to enter 8th grade, which she loved school and did very well.I think my biggest memory with her was when i would pick her up for the weekend on sat. we would go out and run errands and she would just go on and on, talking about all sorts of things. I would tease her that she didn't know how to not talk, but it never bothered her she would just go right back to running that mouth. When i had enough i would reach over a tickle her to destract her. But we also had some serious conversations in the car as well. We spoke about her diabetes, boys, and other important things. I truly miss her.Her funeral was friday, and i couldn't believe how many kids were there. They put lots of flowers and little stuffed animals with her. She was/is loved by many.Thanks for an ear, it does help. How old was your son? The hurt never really goes away does it? I keep pushing myself to do normal everyday things, i do it for her. But i've done that her whole life, everything i've done i've done for her. But that's just being a mom.Well thanks for being here.",

            "answer": "Ah, she sounds lovely and so like the typical teen.\u00a0\u00a0I know you miss not being able to talk to her.\u00a0\u00a0I still miss talking to my mom in that same way.\u00a0\u00a0I lost her to cancer almost five years ago.Going on is tough, but we all have to make decisions about how we will do that, don't we?\u00a0\u00a0Give yourself lots of time.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone handles grief in different ways.\u00a0\u00a0It is a real energy zapper, but that part is normal too so don't expect too much of yourself for awhile.\u00a0\u00a0I have my daughter, son-in-law, and two grandsons to focus on and I feel so blessed to have them. My son was 33 years old when we lost him.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, over the years he chose paths that were not healthy for him and that led to diabetic complications to manifest much quicker.\u00a0\u00a0He died of end stage heart and kidney failure and was completely blind in one eye and nearly so in the other eye.\u00a0\u00a0I loved my son very much and wish I could hug him right now.\u00a0\u00a0He was a very gifted person who loved music, art, and people and loved to laugh.\u00a0\u00a0We used to love to go to movies together and he was thrilled with technology and how to combine it with his love of art and music.You are right about the pain never going away.\u00a0\u00a0It does lessen however.\u00a0\u00a0It is one of those things that people do not fully understand unless they experience the pain themselves.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, I would never wish this on any parent and I suspect you would say the same.\u00a0\u00a0I have a poem I carry with me in my paper organizer that addresses this very thing.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know who wrote it, but it goes:My Mom is a SurvivorMy mom is a survivor, or so I've heard it said.But I hear her crying at night when all others are in bed.I watch her lay awake at night and go to hold her hand.She doesn't know I'm with her to help her understand.But like the sands on the beach that never wash away..I watch over my surviving mom, who thinks of me each day.She wears a smile for others...a smile of disguise.But through Heaven's door I see tears flowing from her eyes.My mom tries to cope with death to keep my memory alive,But anyone who knows her knows it is her way to survive.As I watch over my surviving mom...through Heaven's open door,I try to tell her that angels protect me forever more.But I know that doesn't help her or ease the burden she bears.So if you get a chance, go visit her... And show her that you care, for no matter what she says...no matter what she feels,my surviving mom has a broken heart that time won't ever heal.I know your heart is hurting and mine hurts for you.",

My duaghter was an only child, she always wanted a sister.Your son sounds like he was a good person, probably got that from his mom. So sorry he's gone.Annalise...She really hadn't had many complications. She had problems getting her sugar levels steady. She was always running 200 or above. She had a condition when her sugar dropped to low, i forget what the doctor called it, but when it dropped really low she had these symptoms much like a stroke. She would totally lose the function of her entire right sight side, throw up and sleep, then when her sugar came up she had massive migrains. But when her sugar went to high she would often start throwing up and sleeping until her sugar came down. She once had a kidney infection and was on a thyroid pill for a while. But that's the only complications she really had. Just high sugar levels.I had to go to my doctor today and he explained to me that what probably happened was that she entered ketoacidiosis from her high sugars which lead to her brain shutting down. But i take comfort in the fact that she passed in her sleep.",

I can't imagine your pain, but I am so proud that you have the courage to reach out for help. I can't possibly understand what you are going through and have been happy with the special responses that you have recieved. Starnrose is a wonderful mother and does understand what you are dealing with.I haven't lost a child, but I have reached out to family and dear friends for support during dark times and can honestly say I wouldn't have made it through it without them. Don't be afraid to cry and have someone hold you or just talk.This is the time that you need to let others take care of you.I would strongly recommend that you contact our sister outreach program at www.jdrf.org and click onto the left side called Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST). This is a confidential one on one online communication. You would be matched with a volunteer who is going through similar circumstances. You may also want to contact www.childrenwithdiabetes.com. This is also a wonderful site that has chat rooms and great support.I wish you the very best through this terrible journey and hope that you stay strong and recieve the help and support you so desperately need. You are in all of our thoughts.Please keep in touch,dm",

I think we all wish we could re-run that and bring your daughter back.I think that a number of us fear for our diabetic children (with good cause), and your tradgedy will have sharpened our focus, on what is important.When my older kids read your post, they started to affirm their appreciation of and to their siblings.

Normally I fix her and her two brothers plates every night.\u00a0\u00a0Well this morning I decided to check her meter machine because she has been so quick with testing and\u00a0\u00a0giving her insulin at each meal.\u00a0\u00a0I found that she is only checking like twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0She did not check this morning yet she ate breakfast, gave her 24 hour insulin and went to school.\u00a0\u00a0I am totally freaked.\u00a0\u00a0After everything she knows about diabetes and the complications it just stuns me that she would take such chances.\u00a0\u00a0She has only went to the hospital on one occassion since being diagnosed and that was for high bg and high levels of ketones.\u00a0\u00a0After fluids they sent her home that afternoon.Any suggestions?\u00a0\u00a0People have told me that the \"good girl\" syndrome would wear off and she would rebel.\u00a0\u00a0I have had her read the book called \"Needles\" which clearly shows how not caring for yourself can let your diabetes get our of control.\u00a0\u00a0I am just speachless.\u00a0\u00a0I know dealing with this disease is terrible for all involved but I need her to realize that we could loose her to this if she does not get a grip!!",
