    "question": "I am a 24 year old woman with an eight month old son. For the past 4 months or so I have been having sudden muscle spasms through out my body. It started with my finger, then calfs then arms and so on. It feels like my muscles are jumping deep inside me (if that makes since). Some times the muscle can actually be seen moving. I have been to my doc and tested for diabetes, high bp, thyroid disease, and high cholesterol. My tests all came back normal. Most recently i have them in my lower abdomen (which I believe this to be IBS)During labor the doc's started an epidural but couldn't complete it due to me having pre eclampsia (SP)and the risk of my blood not clotting. I was in mild back pain for about 2 weeks. Could this be the cause of my tics? (i have read that spinal injuries can have side effects, however that was so long ago) I have gone off the pill for almost 4 weeks now to see if it was a side effect of the pill (i have been on the pill since 2 weeks after giving birth). I have a neuro appt that is set for 1-30-07! I don't think these tics are caused by diet because i eat rather well. One doc was asking about a history of MS in my family. There isn't one to my knowledge. I am also unaware of any neuro disorder in my family. The tics are not painful, they some times last a few seconds and others will last a minute or more. They are not painful. It is just a pain to not know whats going on with your body.I would like to get down to the bottom of this problem so I can stop worring. Has anyone else had this problem before? I have never experienced anything like this before",
