            "answer": "Hi,I am diabetic and my thyroid has't been working for the past 10 years or so.\u00a0\u00a0The diabetes only got officially diagnosed last year, though I did have gestational diabetes with my pregnancy about 3 years ago.My best advice is make sure that your FT3 and FT4 levels are optimal (as a starting point FT4 should be at least mid range, and FT3 in the upper half of the range - these can be further adjusted by how you feel).\u00a0\u00a0Consider low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0This will help the weight management and also the diabetes.Best wishes....",

    "question": "I will be having another needle biopsy on what is left of my thyroid, which is the right side. The left side was removed because of a large nodule almost 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Now the right side has a nodule that was tested in Sept with a needle biopsy, and it was fine. It was 2 cm at that time, after they did the needle biopsy and needle aspiration, it was down to 1.7cm.\u00a0\u00a0I went in med December because it felt like the nodule had grown.\u00a0\u00a0They did a scan of my thyroid/nodule and it had grown to 3 cm. I go in January 10th to have another needle biopsy and to discuss what we will do, i.e. maybe surgery?\u00a0\u00a0My concern is I'm a type 2 diabetic and from what I have read on this site it is hard enough dealing with health issues without your thyroid, let alone dealing with diabetes as well.\u00a0\u00a0Any diabetics living without their thyroid? How are you doing? Any words of advice?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks! :0) AnnaG.",
