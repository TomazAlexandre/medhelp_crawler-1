            "answer": "It is going to be very difficult to help your girl if she is unwilling to help herself by going for tests and following the doctor's directions.\u00a0\u00a0The first thing she needs is to test for Free T3 and Free T4 (not the same as Total T3 and Total T4), along with TSH.\u00a0\u00a0Since her symptoms sound more like hyperthyroid issues than hypo, she should also request the Thyroid-Stimulating Immunoglobulin test, usually called the TSI test, which is to detect Grave's Disease.Regarding her symptom of drinking a lot of water, I have read that can be one of the symptoms of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Here is a quote on that.\"If it feels like you can't get enough water and you're drinking much more than usual, it could be a sign of diabetes, especially if it seems to go hand in hand with frequent urination. If your body is pulling extra water out of your blood and you're running to the bathroom more, you will become dehydrated and feel the need to drink more to replace the water that you are losing.\"Since diabetes and thyroid problems sometimes occur together, she should also ask the doctor to test for the possibility of diabetes, by testing her blood sugar levels.From the little info available, that is the best I can suggest right now.\u00a0\u00a0I also suggest that you should gently express your concern to your girl and tell her about the searching you have done for possible answers that might help her and that you think she needs to do the above tests to find out what is causing her symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0 Hopefully your concern will be enough to get her to focus on helping herself feel better.\u00a0\u00a0Please let us know how it works out and also if we can provide any additional info.",
