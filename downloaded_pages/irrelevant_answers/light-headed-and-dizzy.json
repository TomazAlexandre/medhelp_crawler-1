            "answer": "Hi Michelle. I work as a nurse, so I know some things, but I am sure not half as many as your doctor. Low blood pressure is the usual cause I think, which could be caused by dehydration, medication, anaemia, loss of blood for some reason and of course pregnancy, low blood sugar - from not eating enough or often enough, or possibly diabetes, though this is much less likely.\u00a0\u00a0It could be caused by anything that makes your blood vessels dilate - which includes pregnancy. Could you be pregnant? Those are the things I can think of off the top of my head.I think though whatever it is isn't not there just because you haven't been to the Dr about it. It so much more likely to be nothing - go on and bite the bullet. You know its got to happen sooner or later! Go and make the appointment !And good luck. x",
