            "answer": "If you're only 5 weeks pregnant, it's not unheard of that you simply didn't have enough of the pregnancy hormone HCG built up to register on a pregnancy test yet.\u00a0\u00a0Or your levels may still be so low for other reasons that it isn't showing up in your urine.\u00a0\u00a0You will probably have more testing done to make sure the pregnancy progresses normally, and to keep your diabetes under control.",

            "answer": "Is there any news on why you started bleeding? Being 5 weeks, that's very scary. It's too early to see a heartbeat, but I'm sure in the next 2 weeks you'll have another ultrasound. I really hope everything is going okay with your little baby. You say you're not ready, but if you think that you are somewhere inside you, then listen to it. Life will change in the next 9 months, and you'll slowly prepare yourself for it.I really hope the best.. I'm afraid to say 'congrats' because I dont know what your situation is... If it's a good thing, or a bad.. Or what you're going to do about it.Keep us posted. I wish the best for you and your little one.Take Care",
