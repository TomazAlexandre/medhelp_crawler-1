            "answer": "Diet is very important in dealing with PCOS as it's related to pre-diabetes or type II diabetes and both are related to weight and diet.It's important that you stop eating or at least cut back on processed foods, such as breads, pasta, white rice, pastries, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Anything made with white flour and sugar are, typically, to be shunned.Your diet should center around fresh/frozen veggies, whole grains and lean meats, with healthy fats, nuts and nut butters, seeds, fruits (not more than 1-2 servings/day).You should first calculate your daily calorie needs, based on your current age, height and weight, then subtract about 500 calories/day in order to lose 1-2 lbs/day, which is considered to be safe weight loss.Once you are eating the right type of foods in the right amounts and getting the right amount of exercise, you should be able to lose weight.One further recommendation, though... many people with PCOS also have hypothyroidism, so if your thyroid levels have not been tested (you need Free T3 and Free T4 along with TSH, not just the TSH as many doctors will tell you), you should get those tested, since the thyroid controls metabolism and without adequate thyroid hormones losing weight is very difficult, if not impossible.",

            "answer": "Are you still here?\u00a0\u00a0I'm sorry I didn't get back to you... I've been sick and haven't been online much.It's kind of hard to actually recommend meals, because I don't know what's available in your country or what foods you like, but I can give you ideas...Breakfast could be a small bowl of oatmeal, with a bit of coconut oil and 1/2 tsp cinnamon stirred in, in place of sugar, with 1/2 cup any kind of fruit and some milk.\u00a0\u00a0Or you could have a couple of eggs scrambled in coconut oil (add a pinch of salt to cut the coconut taste), add fresh spinach, onion, mushrooms, bell peppers, tomato or whatever veggies you like.\u00a0\u00a0You could have a couple of eggs fried in coconut oil (again, add a pinch of salt to cut the coconut taste), with a slice of whole grain toast and a piece of fruit.Lunch could be a chef's salad with lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, bell peppers, spinach and whatever other greens you like, with a hard boiled egg, sliced turkey, chicken, or ham.\u00a0\u00a0You could have a grilled chicken breast with sauteed veggies.Dinner could be any type of meat for protein, with a salad and steamed veggies, a serving of potatoes or rice for starch, etc.The main thing you have to do is watch your portion sizes and make sure you keep those within reasonable limits.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, a portion of meat is 3 oz, which is about the size of a deck of playing cards, so 12 oz steak is definitely too much... A serving of potatoes or other starch is 1/2 cup, etc.If you're eating packaged food, you have to watch the number of servings on package and if it says there are 4 servings in the package and you eat the whole package, you've eaten 4 servings and you have to multiply the calories/serving times 4.\u00a0\u00a0It's best to not eat package/processed foods, because they tend to have the most calories.If you stick with lean meats, eggs, dairy and bean/legumes for protein and fresh/frozen veggies, you don't have to worry so much about counting calories.\u00a0\u00a0Fill your plate with mostly veggies and you'll be pretty safe, because most veggies (except the starchy ones) have so few calories that you can pretty much fill up on them without worrying about the calories.",
