            "answer": "Hello,The urge of frequent urination can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis(inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia, hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diuretic drugs and pregnancy.In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen ,intravenous pyelography , pregnancy blood test, thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made. But firstly try drinking plenty of water because if it is simple UTI, then adequate amount of fluids will flush out the infection.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello I'm not sure if this is how I post my own question because I'm new to this website. I'm 19 years old and as of two days ago I had the urge to urinate once I got up. I went but I still felt like I needed to go after that. This feeling lasted for about two hours then got a better after I took a shower. It completely went away by dinner that night. I thought it would be fine after that but yesterday I got the urge again while taking a math test. The feeling went away after about an hour this time. The feeling isn't constant but its worrying me that it came back after the first time since this has never happened to me before. I'm not sure what this means but its making me a little paranoid and I was wondering if you had any idea what could be going on. Do I need to go to a doctor or what should I do? Thank you so much.This discussion is related to/posts/show/1051249.",
