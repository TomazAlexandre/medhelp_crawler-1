            "answer": "Hi,You should know that most chronicly sick patients (like you) with Lyme will be tested negative for Borellia(Lyme).This bacteria is so aggressive that kills all antibodies very quickly, so the test will not detect anything.Good specialist knows that.Diagnosis will be based mostly on your symptoms.I've been having Lyme for over 3 years.I was tested 3 weeks after I found a tick on my arm-result negative.I really did not need this test to know that I had Lyme.I already had a rash, plus other Lyme symptoms.Test only proved how aggressive is that bacteria.If I were you, I would learn as much as I can about this disease, and find Lyme Disease specialist, not a regular doctor.There are many treatments, including natural ones.There are people who were confined to beds, and they started to walk, but it takes a lot of effort and discipline.",

            "answer": "Hi,Sorry,I was away for the weekend, I couldn't answer earlier.Over 3 yrs ago I myself found a deer tick on my arm, I removed it, and after3 days I noticed a thick red erythema in the place where the tick was.Thatalarmed me,I started to search Internet looking for answers.I easily foundones.I was terrified, mostly because I knew that it was hard to find the rightdoctor.Official treatment for this disease is 2-3 weeks of antibiotictherapy.It is a very big lie.Of course behind that is money.Very quickly I learnedthat this disease is very difficult to treat.And requires a long termantibiotic therapy with high dosages of antibiotics.So, desperately I begun to lookfor a Lyme specialist, who would give me prescription for antibiotics.I foundone, exspensive, but at least I had right treatment.I was on Doxycycline400md/day, plus Cefuroxime1000md/day for 6 months.Then I stared herbal treatment.Istarted treatment one weeks after tick bite.According to all books I shouldbe cured, I am not, but I am better.It is so much more you should know aboutit.Still,I consider myself lucky, because I had that rash after the bite,which alarmed me.Only about 30% of infected people have rash.If not that I wouldbe thinking why I have knee, ankle pain, why my neck is stiff, why my handsare numb, and many many other symptoms.I was reading a lot of stories about people whe were already sick for 10yers, they were misdiagnosed with multiply sclerosis.I remember a guy who wasdiagnosed with MS, he was incontinent of urine,disease was progressing.But oneday he found out about LYme.He started to take high dosages of ABT's,after 8months he became continent, and many other symptomps started to disapear, butfor such cases it takes years to get better, but yes, it is possible.You will get better too,\u00a0\u00a0if you start the right treatment.You can write onmy email if you have any questions, there is so much more you should know.Itis not possible for me to write it here.***@****",

            "answer": "Hi curleegirl,Constipation and stomach bloating can be symptoms of Celiac disease (an intolerance to gluten).\u00a0\u00a0Because celiac is an autoimmune condition, it could also account for the inflammation (the ESR and C-Reactive Protein). I'm not sure if this is what's causing your problem, but you can ask for a celiac blood panel (there are several tests they can run -- may sure you're getting them all).\u00a0\u00a0The classic symptoms of Celiac are things like stomach pain, gas, bloating, constipation or diarrhea, but really the symptoms can be all over the map, and include things like joint pain, sore throat, neurological symptoms, fatigue, anxiety, mood changes/depression.\u00a0\u00a0(I had a bunch of different symptoms, including extreme heat and exercise intolerance -- red feet and hands, bulging veins ...)\u00a0\u00a0Untreated celiac increases the chance of developing other conditions (like RA, thyroid disease, and lymphoma), so it's a good thing to diagnose early (or rule out).Frequent urination and vision problems can be signs/symptoms of diabetes (type 1 diabetes is autoimmune, and can co-occur with Celiac).\u00a0\u00a0I don't know much about diabetes, and it looks like they checked your glucose, but you could see an endocrinologistYour primary care doctor should be able to order the Celiac test, but I agree with agnes that you should keep an eye on the autoimmune diseases -- based on your symptoms, I would try to see a gastroenterologist and a rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0And I think you could keep the lyme in mind.\u00a0\u00a0Before my celiac diagnosis, I was tested for Lyme, it came back negative, but my neurologist gave me a month's course of antibiotics just to be on the safe side (I'm a hiker).Finally, another thing you could do (if you haven't already) is go into a big bookstore and browse through books on autoimmune disease and women's health (e.g., The Autoimmune Epidemic by Faust and Buyon, or other books that offer checklists of possible symptoms).\u00a0\u00a0Your ANA was negative, so maybe it's not autoimmune, but so many women I know have autoimmune problems ...Anyway, sorry for the long post, but I know how frustrating this can be.\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find some answers soon.tcgps - Be aggressive and do what you need to do to get a diagnosis. If doctors dismiss your concerns, go to someone else.\u00a0\u00a0I saw 9 different doctors in 6 months before getting a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I found *How Doctors Think* to be a helpful book for communicating with doctors more effectively.",
