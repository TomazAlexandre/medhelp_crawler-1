            "answer": "I had the same questions when my father died of gallbladder cancer years ago, and never did get a good answer from his doctors.\u00a0\u00a0For that, I had to turn to our family doctor of 20 years.It all depends on what organ the cancer metastacizes to, and there's no way of predicting that.\u00a0\u00a0It may wrap around and block a section of intestine causing a full obstruction with high fever and vomiting.\u00a0\u00a0It could go further into the liver and pancreas and you'll see severe jaundice, diabetes, and of course - tremendous pain.\u00a0\u00a0No doubt you've already noticed weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0My dad didn't have too much pain until his last month when the cancer hit his liver, pancreas and probably his spleen.\u00a0\u00a0As you already suspect, it will probably happen out of the blue, and very quickly.It's horrible to have to watch a loved one slowly deteriorate from a terminal illness; and even worse to not get a straight answer from the doctors.\u00a0\u00a0I think the docs shy away from death almost worse than the patients and family members - as if it's an insult to their practice.\u00a0\u00a0My dad made the decision to stop the chemo as it wasn't making a darn bit of difference - didn't even slow the progression - so he opted for as much quality of life as he had left to him.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't easy for the rest of us to accept, but we had no other choice.If you haven't already done so, consider posting this information on the Cancer forum.\u00a0\u00a0God Bless.",

            "answer": "On the contrary, she actually PUT ON a little weight. She has no jaundice, but has uncomfortableness in her abdomen, sometimes painful, but not off the charts. So do I understand you correctly in that she could look and sound fine one day, then this creep up on her rather quickly?",

            "answer": "Yes, that's exactly it.\u00a0\u00a0The cancer is still growing, but apparently hasn't yet done enough damage to slow her down, but it certainly will happen at some point since your mom has discontinued treatment.I'm so sorry that HIPPA laws prevent your mom's doctors from speaking to you about her condition.\u00a0\u00a0You might consider making an appointment with our own doctor and discuss the physiological response of cancer with him.\u00a0\u00a0Our family doc was so good with us during my dad's illness in that regard - but that was pre-HIPPA.",

    "question": "My mother was diagnosed with bile duct cancer in June of 06. She had a resection of her liver, which was sucessful but the cancer came back in Feb 07 at which point they gave her 6-12 months as it mestasized to her liver and lungs. She is a very stubborn woman who doesn't want her kids to worry, and won't allow us to talk to the Dr for answers.She was on light chemo for a while until the cancer grew slightly. The Drs gave her a stronger and different type which she took herself off of, because of how she was feeling. We are now at the 12 month point that was given to her, and with my experience with cancer I thought we would see some significant downgrade in her health. There has been a downgrade but is still able to drive and take care of herself but is always very tired. My question is what do we look for as far as outward signs that she is nearing the end? Is this a type of cancer that all of a sudden sneaks up on a person and they pass soon, or will us kids see a slow downgrade in her health. I realize that everyone is different, but as her kids we need to know what to look for as we are all not sure of how this will progress. Thank you for your help.",
