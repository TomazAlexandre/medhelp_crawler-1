            "answer": "As you said, nobody knows.. not even the drs.In 2007 I suffered a severe HA that left me with an EF of 23%, my prognosis was that I probably should have to go to ER 3 to 4 times per year because of my CHF, and in 2-3 years time I would be in the transplant list.Today, almost 4 years from that, I have not a single symptom , I do a normal life and have visited the ER just once for a pulmonary edema.I think it is all about how good or bad health you have, how determine to live you are and how lucky you are.Good life style, strict following the meds, stop salt intake, and a permanent questioning on how I can improve has been my key pointsJesus.",

            "answer": "I get tired so easily, too. Just walking from my car to a building can be exhausting with someone with CHF. I take Lisinopril, Multaq, and Digoxin. I don't know how I got this Congestive Heart Failure. The doctor said it is caused by a weak heart muscle that can no longer pump enough oxygen to get rid of excess fluid in someone's body. I guess I wore out my heart. I am 61 years old and I have done a lot of things to wear out my heart muscle. I should have taken it easier in my life and not wore out my heart like I did.",

            "answer": "You need to cut yourself some slack, as CHF causes swellling, and with the swelling comes excess weight, which makes your body heavier to carry around, thus tiring you out quicker.I have had CHF for about 5 years, now.\u00a0\u00a0I have and ICD implant in my chest that paces my heartbeat,\u00a0\u00a0and will shock my heart, should the need arise in order to get me going again.I receive dialysis 6 days a week, and I follow a very strict diet, along with the proper meds, and I'm doing great!I didn't start out feeling great, though.\u00a0\u00a0It has taken a lot of hard work, and dedication, to stay alive.I do have a question though,\u00a0\u00a0\"Does your doctor offer a cause of your illness?\"\u00a0\u00a0I contracted a super virus which attacks the major organs of the body, ie: heart, liver, kidneys, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I feel fortunate to be alive, as I have watched others in my area, who didn't fight it with everything they had, and it took them......the youngest, so far, 20 years old.I hope the best for you all, but it won't happen unless you adhere to a strict cardiac diet,\u00a0\u00a0get your weight into normal range, if you smoke, quit, and if you drink, quit, then, of course, take you meds religiously.....all of this, with all the excercise you can handle, might, save your lives.",

    "question": "Yes I know that there is no promised life time line, none of us are god but I was just trying to get a realistic time frame or what to expect now that I am dealing with a loved one that has been told the ejection farction of their heart function is 24 percent and they have COPD and diabetes and portal vein hypertension and their health is not the best. They use currently 2 liters of oxygen, and have been diagnoised with congestive heart failure so I am just trying to prepare for what to expect the future to be like so I can prepare and best care for them? Please advise",
