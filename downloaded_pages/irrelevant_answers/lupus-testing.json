    "question": "My daughter\u00a0\u00a0has lupus, she recently went to a neurologist and was given a test based on her memory,she was told she needed an MRI of her brain, (at which time she would be retested while having the MRI). This is to show any damage that lupus may be inflicting on her brain. My daughter seldom talks about this illness and I am pretty much clueless. Can anyone let me know about this test?",
