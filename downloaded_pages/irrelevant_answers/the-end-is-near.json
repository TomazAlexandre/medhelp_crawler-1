            "answer": "Lucky you! You have a date! I have another growth scan next monday, so maybe they might make some decisions for me then. I also have gestational diabetes, so not sure if they think that complicates things even more, but if i was to be induced in my 38th week that would be great, although i'd really like to try and go into labor naturally this time. All the best for the birth of your little boy on the 9th. Don't forget to update us!",
