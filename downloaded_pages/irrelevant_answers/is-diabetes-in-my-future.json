            "answer": "Hi,Unfortunately diabetes during pregnancy does put you at much higher risk of developing diabetes later in life.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1 and/or Type 2.You are not overweight and you are very physically active.\u00a0\u00a0But you have now had 2 readings that are higher than they should be.\u00a0\u00a0You are also urinating more frequently than usual.\u00a0\u00a0This is often a sign of diabetes and you definitely need to get checked out.You need to test fasting as soon as you wake up in the morning. It should be < 95 (ideally in the high 70s to mid-80s).You should then test 90 minutes to 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0It should be less than 120 (ideally less than 100).Do a few tests and take this info to your dr.\u00a0\u00a0Ask to have your Hba1c tested.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally it is < 5.0 and anything above 5.7 will get you diagnosed with at least prediabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Assuming your a1c is higher than it should be and your fasting and post eating are high (fasting above 125 will get you diagnosed, as will post eating above 180).I suggest that they test you for adult onset type 1 (LADA).\u00a0\u00a0They can test for this with antibody tests (though false negative is possible), and also they can test something called C-peptide (this should be tested at the same time as fasting glucose), which can help determine if your body is making too much insulin or not enough.\u00a0\u00a0 Adult onset type 1 type of diabetes frequently does better if insulin (typically low dose) is used early in the course, rather than oral meds.\u00a0\u00a0If your Dr does want you to try oral meds then please avoid the sulfonurea drugs (these force your pancreas to put out more insulin and make it burn out more quickly).Please look at eating a low carb diet (Moderate protein and high in healthy fats - unprocessed naturally occurring fats), which will also help with controlling blood sugar and may even help delay requirement for insulin.I recommend you go to Utube and take a look at \"Bernstein Diabetes University\".\u00a0\u00a0He has many short sessions on diabetes and diabetes management using low carb approach.Please come back and let us know how you go.\u00a0\u00a0 And ask more questions.",

            "answer": "mmm.\u00a0\u00a0I also hope your meter was lying.171 2 hours after eating is too high for non-diabetic.You can experiment with what you eat (avoiding grains and starchy carbs), eat more non-starchy veges, and proteins and fats, to see if that helps your meter number come down.the thing is that if you have autoimmune type diabetes (think adult onset type 1) things can progress fairly fast.Your dr should also test your insulin levels at the same time as the Hba1c and fasting.\u00a0\u00a0Please see if that can still happen.....\u00a0\u00a0would give some useful information (If fasting glucose and insulin are both high it would skew the diagnosis towards type 2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If fasting glucose is high and insulin is on the low side, it would skew the diagnosis to type 1 - and needs further investigation).Treatment for type 2 (early) is insulin sensitisers (and low carb diet, exercise) etc..Treatment for type 1 is preferably insulin,\u00a0\u00a0even in early adult onset type 1 (along with low carb diet and exercise).Let us know how you go.",

Last night 2 hours after supper I hit 188.. She said as long as I don't hit 200 I would not be diagnosed with diabetes.. Makes me wonder if I did not run as much as I do where would my numbers be then? Also I see so many women my age that eat horrible and do not exercise at all ...are they walking time bombs?

If so , that's really high for a non diabetic . Also the night time readings seem high . I know the doctor told you you aren't diabetic til you hit 200,but you already hit 188 2 hours after a meal . Your post meal readings seem high for a non diabetic . If you aren't diabetic , then you can turn this around . But you seem very close to being a diabetic . Please look at Sugar 101 website . There is so much helpful info there . I think your dr should have done the A1c test especially since the numbers are so high.\u00a0\u00a0I wish I could be of more help to you. Others on here are more knowledgeable than I am and can really help you. Keep posting so we know how you are doing. I know it's scary . But it will be ok.",

            "answer": "Dear Run,Your dr is not doing you any favors by refusing to test Hba1c.Hba1c is used as a monitoring parameter and allows you to see what is happening with your blood sugar over time.\u00a0\u00a0In many cases, fasting blood sugar will be the last to be abnormal and your post eating numbers are quite high.I think you need a second opinion and a new doctor who will encourage you to manage and treat this aggressively (whether by lifestyle alone or with drug help).\u00a0\u00a0If you just wait until your fasting numbers are very high, before you do anything you will already have done damage to your body.Normal blood sugars are always in the range of about 70 - 120. With fasting always in the range of 70 - 90 for non-diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0Your numbers are at least 50% higher than completely normal.You can test before meals from time to time to see if your sugars have gone down to fasting levels (they should).Peak sugars after eating will typically be 1.5 - 2 hours after eating, though if eating something very fatty (like pizza) which slows digestion and absorption, the high can happen quite a few hours later.Keep reading.\u00a0\u00a0 Adopt low carb diet and learn to eat to your meter.\u00a0\u00a0Look into getting a second option and a much better workup.\u00a0\u00a0 Given your history of GD, your weight, and your activity level (all of which should be helping) the doctor should be taking your case much more seriously.\u00a0\u00a0 Is there any way you can be referred to an endocrinologist?",
