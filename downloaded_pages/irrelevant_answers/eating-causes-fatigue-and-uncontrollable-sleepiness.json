    "question": "I'm a 24 yr old female of normal weight.\u00a0\u00a0Whenever I eat even a small amount of food, I get extremely tired and fall asleep.\u00a0\u00a0Both my mind and my body become fatigued, and if I remain awake I feel like my arms and legs are difficult to move.\u00a0\u00a0I counter sometimes this by not eating at all during the day, then eating a large meal before bed.\u00a0\u00a0If I eat late at night, I wake up more groggy in the morning than if I hadn't eaten at all.\u00a0\u00a0I will fall asleep after I've eaten even if I find something mentally stimulating to work on and even if I keep moving (bouncing my leg, writing, or twirling an ink pen) no matter how hard I try to stay awake.\u00a0\u00a0When I sleep at night, I sleep hard and nothing wakes me up.\u00a0\u00a0I sleep about 10-12 hours a day including naps.\u00a0\u00a0I wake up just as tired as I was when I went to sleep, but eating makes the tiredness much worse.\u00a0\u00a0This problem is not of recent onset; I remember even in elementary school I would avoid eating during the day because \"if I eat then I can't think\".\u00a0\u00a0I also have virtually no feelings of hunger; I could go for a few days without eating and not feel hungry, but eventually I crave certain foods or I feel shaky and weak and I have to eat.Does anyone know what my symptoms could be or how I can manage them?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",
