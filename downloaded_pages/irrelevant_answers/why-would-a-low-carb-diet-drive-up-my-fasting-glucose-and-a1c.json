            "answer": "Your fasting levels are within normal range but your A1c says otherwise; 5.8%=120 mg/dl, and 5.9%=123 mg/dl. Both are prediabetes and tip-toeing closely to diabetes land.What \"meds for hypertension and cholesterol\" are you taking? We can search to see if possible drug interaction/s are taking place. Drug interactions may/can elevate glucose levels.It's important to read nutrition labels carefully. Many salad dressings contain large amounts of sugar, most are listed under carbohydrates in grams. Every 7 grams equals one heaping tablespoon of sugar. Although Greek yogurt is low in carbs, carb sugars can average 5 grams per serving [2/3 cup]. However, if you consume yogurt as part of your pre-workout regimen you may be able to burn of the carbs and sugar as energy. The only way to know is by testing after your post exercise rest down period. You do have a home glucose test meter, right?This is an excellent web site to look up nutritional data on all foods you consume. Search Atkins bars by name followed by the word 'nutrition'. Some have zero sugars others up to 5 grams.http://nutritiondata.self.com/Good luck -",

            "answer": "You're welcome Ruthiejb. Also, watch out for hidden sugars like dextrose [a carb sugar], sucrose, fructose [fruit sugar] and HFCS [made from corn starch]. Eat fruits with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose. Understand which fruits are low in fructose and which ones that are way high on the do not eat list.I don't get the SloNiacin. Niacin is a B3 and is known to elevate blood sugars. You can control cholesterol through proper nutrition. Use Google search on 'foods that may raise cholesterol' then avoid them, like ground turkey.With regular exercise it is important to adjust your carb intake accordingly. It's a catch-22; carbs raise blood sugars but at the same time we need carbs [glycogen from the liver] for energy. This is why testing is very important to understand how much carbs your body can take. Test times are:\u00b7 preprandial - b4 a meal to get a baseline measurement\u00b7 postprandial - 2-3 hours after eating to see how the foods you ate affected your levels. Compare against preprandial\u00b7 B4 exercise - like preprandial gives you a baseline measurement\u00b7 30-40 minutes after exercise [rest down or cool down period] - presents a good insight on how much blood sugar you burnt off.Lotrel - may raise blood sugarsSpironolactone - may raise blood sugarsIf these elevated your blood sugars you would have seen that a long time ago. Instead, concentrate on proper nutrition and continue with the exercising. Good luck -",

            "answer": "Thanks for posting your find, Ruthiejb. I checked the Walden site. Salad dressings use Splenda [sucralose] as the sweetening agent, a non-digestible sugar derivative that doesn't raise glucose levels. My only concern is the amount of sodium per serving [2 Tbsp], quite high IMO. By adding EVOO perhaps you can double the serving size w/o adding sodium. Another thought is eating salad with Walden's after workout to replenish lost sodium [an electrolyte] from sweat.",

            "answer": "\"...the A1c is not necessarily accurate in non-diabetic people because, according to one doctor, their RBC's live longer so the glucose has more time to accumulate.\"Keep in mind medicine is a science and there will always be two sides to the coin. It is true not everyone are the same and RBC's may live longer in some and perhaps even shorter in others. Whether this applies to non-diabetics vs diabetics I would say maybe in some but not everyone. If it was true it would be written in stone, per se. IMO this debate can be endless. Somewhere along the line a stance has to be made to help make a decision on the patients behalf. I try to follow the AACE [American Association of Clinical Endocrinologist] guidelines. There the doctors not I.The A1c does provide a good insight by capturing the excess glucose on \"new\" RBC's. Convert your A1c results into estimated Average Daily Glucose [eAG] with this formula28.7 x A1c - 46.7 = eAG in mg/dl[note: mmol/l uses another formula]But, nothing beats daily testing especially postprandial.HTH",
