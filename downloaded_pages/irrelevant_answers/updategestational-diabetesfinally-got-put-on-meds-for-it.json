            "answer": "a co-worker of mine recently had a baby boy. she too had gestational diabetes. however aside from sugar pills, she was also taking insulin shots. her boy turned out to be 10lbs some ounces. with gestational diabetes the baby tends to be on the bigger side. she had to get a c-section. if i recall, your scheduled for one also which would be good considering she's already 5lbs. we dispense glyburide all the time to our diabetic patients. it seems to be pretty good. i know having the nurses recognize you is a good feeling, and it makes you a whole lot more comfortable. well now its just a matter of time. before you know it your little girl will be here. take care for the remainder.",

    "question": "Well I had my first successful NST yesterday. My poor DD is running out of room and no longer has anywhere to hide from the heart monitor. I think she already weighs 5lbs at 32wks!!! Man if I went full term she would be a big one!!My blood sugar has been running over 200 after I eat... which is not good at all. My doctor gave me Glyburide which I have never heard of. I also had to get glucose tablets in case my sugar bottoms out. I went to L&D Wednesday night cause my blood sugar had been over 200 for over 2hrs and didn't look to be going down. It finally started to go down after I got to the hospital. My urine glucose was 500 when I was at the hospital. =( My BP was 148/ something and my heart rate was 151. It wouldn't go down so they finally made me roll on my side and then my BP went too low. Bottom # was 45. So yeah. Hopefully this stuff helps and things will be ok for the next 5wks that I have left. It's so funny all the nurses at the hospital (not a small hospital by the way) recognize me when I come in. I just love the L&D nurses. They are so sweet and nice. Well just thought I'd update you ladies.... my doctor is starting to rush me around again... guess I'm getting on his nerves. *sigh*",
