            "answer": "I was 32 wks on tues.i had a scan and was measuring 37 wks.first of all,are u sure u have all your dates correct? They will check if u have gestational diabetes, u will have to fast and be given a few blood tests and have to drink whatever glucose drink they give u. If u have it u will be put on tablets for the rest of ur pregnancy and will be given a strict diet to follow. It tends to go after u have the baby but u can get it back in future pregnancies. Best of luck.im will get my results on tuesday.",

            "answer": "This is my 2nd pregnancy, my daughter ava was 6lb 2oz when she was born at 6days over due. With this pregnancy they questioned me why she was so small.i ate and ate but she was tiny when born.so they said they will monitor me and now my baby is well above average size and its weighing 4lb12oz at 32wk. It should only be going on 4lb. So i cant win. I have tried to eat healthy but i do have my weaknesses with jam donuts and chocolate so id say i am a diabetic. If u have eaten alot of fruit and carbhydrates they all break down into sugar so that could be where u are going wrong if u do have diabetes. Anyway if u do,they will have caught it early and u will get the proper care straight away so u will be fine.good luck anyway!",
