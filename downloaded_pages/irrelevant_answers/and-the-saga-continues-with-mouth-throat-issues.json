            "answer": "Hi,How old are you? Have you got diabetes ruled out? Are you taking any other medications?\u00a0\u00a0There are many reasons to cause the dryness of the throat, out of that, Sjogren's syndrome is one. Post menopausal period can also cause dryness of the mouth and throat. Try taking artificial chewing xylitol-containing gum and a carboxymethyl cellulose saliva substitute as a mouthwash. Drink plenty of water and avoid sugar products (water is required for breaking down of glucose in the body). Any more doubts you are welcome.RegardsOHNS2010",

            "answer": "Hi,Since how long are you using Xanax? If used for long it can cause the xerostomia (dryness of the mouth). Have you got your thyroid function done? Hormonal imbalance can cause xerostomia. If possible get sialometry, or salivary flow measurement and Salivary scintigraphy done they can help in diagnosis.

            "answer": "I had a 24-hr ph test done some time back and it showed mild acid reflex. I was on Protonix then Nexium for quite a long time with no improvement. Actually, had to stop the Nexium due to side effects after the last time of long term use.\u00a0\u00a0Caused me muscle and leg pain and, whether that was the reason or not, I had a fractured rib of unknown cause. I've read those meds can cause problems and I have osteo anyway.",

            "answer": "I've wondered about the Xanax but the insert says nothing about dry mouth and the pharmacist also said that should not be a problem. I've been on a low dose now for almost 3 years?\u00a0\u00a0They dry mouth and throat (although, not as bad as it is now) started prior to me starting the Xanax.\u00a0\u00a0They've checked my thyroid more times then I can count also has ultrasound and do have nodules and a biopsy was taken.\u00a0\u00a0They don't suspect the thyroid though it runs rampant on my mother's side of the family. Actually, I took it upon myself to make an appt with (what is supposed to be) a good endocronologist here but can't get in until May!!!!\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, I really feel we do not have very good doctors in this area and usually have to go to the Bay area or Sacto (been there) to specialists.\u00a0\u00a0Haven't had the salivary flow test.\u00a0\u00a0I had the biopsies last week but no results yet. I'll try to remember to ask this latest ENT doc about that.\u00a0\u00a0He mentioned about maybe referring me to a rheumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested (and he is probably doing it again with these biopsies)\u00a0\u00a0at least 3 times for Sjorgens, all negative.\u00a0\u00a0I mention that I've been having night sweats for the past year and I am way past menopause.\u00a0\u00a0I did read the Xanax can cause that but wonder why, since I've been on it for so long, why that problem didn't start sooner if it is the Xanax.\u00a0\u00a0 Yesterday, again, had stomach pain and was upset.\u00a0\u00a0Feel better today.\u00a0\u00a0If I find a doctor that can figure this out,The only other thing that a neurologist ran showed elevated levels of Herpes and EPV.\u00a0\u00a0I think I posted in the EPV forum on that.\u00a0\u00a0I'm going to apply for Mystery Diagnosis!!!!Thanks for the suggestions.\u00a0\u00a0Can't seem to figure this out.",

    "question": "The latest ENT doctor I've been going to did biopsies (2) from my tongue and one salivary gland biopsy, this time near the parotid gland.\u00a0\u00a0Don't have results yet. He told my husband he did a thorough exam while I was under anesthetic and really doesn't seen anything that would be causing all my problems. Does not see anything indicating cancer.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested for Sjorgens (biopsy), which was negative.\u00a0\u00a0I still have terrible dry mouth and throat and a feeling of something stuck in my throat, mainly from behind the left nostril down the left side of my throat. Add to that, usually a feeling of nausea.\u00a0\u00a0For some reason, after the procedure, I seemed to have broken out with a couple of canker sores inside my mouth and a cold sore on the outside.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I should try taking the Valtrix that another doctor suggested I do for 30 days.\u00a0\u00a0I've not taken it before and always worry about reactions.\u00a0\u00a0I am sooooooooooo tired of just not feeling well and this mouth and throat business.\u00a0\u00a0:-(",
