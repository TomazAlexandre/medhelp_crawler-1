            "answer": "Hi, thank you so much for your response. We have been assured by the hospital that they will investigate all avenues to find the cause of my mother's problems. The list you have given me will be a great starting point for them and has given myself some hope at last. They have ruled out Diabetes in the past but may be worth checking again!! They have also ruled out Adrenal Gland tumours which was a very difficult test for them to get right ??? Mum had to do 5 24hr urine tests until they got it correct ??? Unfortunately, i have lost all faith in my local hospital, but luckily we have a great GP....and with your help also, i'm sure we will get there. Thank you so much for taking the time to respond to me....i will keep you up-dated.",

            "answer": "Hi again, my mum showed the list of possibilities to the doctor on her rounds today and was told all of these have been ruled out through blood tests, scans, xrays and ct-scan. This ct-scan was done around 3 months ago due to the same symptoms. Her white cells are good and all tests are coming back clear. She had a couple of good days where the nausea was under control but was experiencing back pain (which she has suffered for many years). Today, she is back to feeling very sick which is being controlled again by this sickness drug (sorry unsure of the name). But, she is as white as a ghost and has a high temperature and tremendous back and stomach pain (her stomach is very swolen)....the doctors are still stumped and are asking for help from another doctor who has treated mum in the past. So still no diagnosis and wonder if there ever will be. I realise you are very busy, but if you are able to help again in any way, i'd be so grateful. Many thanks Becky",

            "answer": "Hi again,\u00a0\u00a0I am just about ok, i think, thank you :) The CT brain scan was done around 3 months ago when mum was taken into hospital with the same symptoms as this time....I believe the CT abdomen has already been done, if not, that is probably the scan she has coming up, hopefully this week. I will find out for definate and try to speak to her doctor myself regarding your above possibilities as we really do need a disagnosis this time for mums sake. Many many thanks again for all your help, i will keep you informed. Kindest regards Becky",

            "answer": "Hi again, mum called me today in tears. She has spoken to her doctor who said he will not do a CT abdomen or brain as they were done 3 months ago. They are just going to control the vomiting, get her eating and send her home. I am now at the end of my tether and am awaiting a phone call from her doctor....so the reassurance of a diagnosis which we had been promised, looks highly unlikey. Just thought i'd keep you informed. I am going to see if it's possible to get hold of her hospital records and when she is ill again, get her transferred to another hospital. Thank you so much for all your help, kindest regards Becky",

    "question": "Hi, i am new to this site so really hope someone can help please...i care for my disabled parents and my mum is back in hospital again for the 8th time this year. Always the same problem and never been diagnosed. She is 60 years old and suffers with high blood pressure and constant nausea, amongst other things. She has been unable to leave the house for months due to sickness and dizziness. She has been in hospital this time for 7 days and drs have done scans, xrays and blood tests. Her temperature has now come down but she is still feeling very sick and tired. She is being given the best drug possible to stop her being sick (apparently this drug is used for cancer patients) but still feels very nauseaous.....All scans and xrays have come back \"clear\" so drs and her gp are baffled as to why she still has the nausea and extreme tiredness. We feel very frustrated as a family, because the cause of her problems are never found and the stress on my mums body is just too much for her to handle....she feels like giving up completely. Please can someone offer any help at all. Many thanks Becky",
