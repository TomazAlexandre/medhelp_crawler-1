            "answer": "I am 22 wks and feel lightheaded on and off.\u00a0\u00a0I usually feel it after going up the stairs, bending up too quickly, getting out of bed, and making sudden turns.\u00a0\u00a0So, a lot, I supposed.\u00a0\u00a0My OB said it's completely normal from the 2nd trimester on, and most people actually can get it in the 1st trimester, too.\u00a0\u00a0I am trying to do things a little more slowly, but I'm fast-paced by nature, so it's a bit tough. I'm reminded every time I get lightheaded, though.\u00a0\u00a0Everything with me is pretty much normal, too, so my OB is saying it's just that 2nd trimester thing (\"What to Expect When You're Expecting\" says the same thing).\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and try not to make any sudden moves! :)",
