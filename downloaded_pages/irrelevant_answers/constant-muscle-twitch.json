            "answer": "Go for Diabetes investigation and also find about your blood pressure. Check you blood haemoglobin and also find other vitals. If everything is normal it is always good to stick with your neurologist as in some diagnosis it takes lot of time, till all symptoms are evident and also when there are some associated findings in Scans/MRI, it helps. It is good that you do not have anything on your MRI and you might be having some nerve irritations which he has to diagnose the reason . Take care!",
