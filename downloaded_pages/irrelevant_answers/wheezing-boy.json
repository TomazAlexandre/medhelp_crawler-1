    "question": "So I just recently got a new kitty off of craigslist...Its been about a month now. He seems very healthy and everything. Except that for the past week i have noticed him wheezing a bit and today in the morning i woke up to him sneezing rapidly...I got a bit scared...Well anyways he is acting fine except he isnt playing too much and he isnt eating as much as he usually does....You see,we got him very very fat....he was about 30 lbs.....But i think the reason why he got so fat with the previous owners was because he was being dominant with the other cats they had.....With us he has been eating just fine....Not too much....So he is slowly loosing weight. Im sorry i dont mean to be going from one topic to another...I am taking him to the vet in about 30 mins...So i hope its gonna go fine and everything....Could anyone tell me what the wheezing might be? And also how would i go about getting him out to the vet....And i dont mean in what...i mean how can i make a very very indoors kind of cat feel comfy with going out to see a vet?",
