            "answer": "Hi,It is possible that your Dad has some early kidney problems from diabetes but those tests(and the current levels) are not quite specific enough for me to say. The test most often used in screening for kidney problems is a urine microalbumin level, and I am sure this has been checked by his doctors.The elevated BUN and Creatinine can be certainly due to some mild dehydration also especially if your dad is fluid restricted in his diet. This should also be discussed with his kidney specialists/urologists.In terms of diet recommendations, a healthy diabetic diet usually contains many vegetables(especially those high in fiber), protein and some carbohydrates with little fats. I cannot give too many specific recommendations because it may need to be tailored to some degree based on the way your father takes his insulin. I suggest you meet with a diabetes educator/dietician with the specific goal of coming up with meal planning techniques given your vegetarian lifestyle.Take care.",

            "answer": "Thanks Doc!,You are right. My dad does have prostrate enlargement problem (operated 3 times) and therefore dr's have advised him to restrict fluid intake to less than 1 liter.As you have pointed out it is possible that higher blood urea level could be due to that. Yes, I believe urine microalbumin levels have been checked, but I don't have any numbers in my reference recently.We will refer to a diabetologist/dietician as you suggest. Thanks.",

    "question": "Dr. Anita,My dad is 79 years old and has been a diabetic for the last 30 years. Recently, in his blood sugar test, blood urea was 37 (limit 42) and creatinin was +1.0 (<1.2). Is this a positive sign for kidney function deterioration?.He has been on diet most often, however, he tends to eat out at times. He also takes 12ml of insulin both mornings and evenings. As a result, though blood sugar and urine sugar seem to be under control, the blood urea level and creatinin levels seem high. Another complication is that he has prostrate enlargement (operated 3 times so no more operations possible), due to which doctors have asked him to restrict his water intake to less than 1 literWhat type of diet can you recommend (we are vegetarians). Thanks.",
