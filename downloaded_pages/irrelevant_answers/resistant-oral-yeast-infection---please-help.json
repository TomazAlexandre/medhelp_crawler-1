    "question": "I am DESPERATE for a resolution to this. I'm supposed to cycle back to the states to get married in two months, please help me get rid of this before then!!! I have tried everything I can possibly think of and it just won't go away!!!About 6 months ago, I went to a doctor regarding 2 irritating, small, thin white patches on the sides of my tongue (where my teeth touch my tongue) near the back of my mouth.At this time, I asked the doctor to test me for all STDs & Diabetes - all tests came back negative. I also had a CBC done, and there was nothing out of the ordinary.I told the doc that I thought it was an early thrush infection. He disregarded it.About 2 months later, another doc put me on antibiotics for several weeks. It was at this time that my small case of thrush became a full blown monster.Since then, I have been on ketoconazole 3x, I am currently finishing my 3rd cycle that has lasted nearly 1 month. I have gone through 2x 10day nystatin suspension every 4-6 hours (while on ketoconazole). I started taking acidophillus pills, garlic pills, apple cider vinegar pills, rinsing with organic apple cider vinegar. I take a probiotic mint twice each day after brushing my teeth. I take a vitamin D supliment every 3 days. I am currently on day 2 of applying Gentian Violet twice daily (though I think that I will increase it to 3-4x daily). For the last 2 months, I have eaten nothing but grilled chicken, beef, or turkey and cucumbers and/or broccoli with water.Everything I try just seems to suppress it (if that), but not make it disappear... please note that it has never gone away completely, it always comes back.I rub the white coating away, and it just comes back an hour later...",
