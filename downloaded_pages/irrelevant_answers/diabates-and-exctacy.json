            "answer": "We cannot condone any kind of illegal drug use on this website. The law is the law, whether you agree with it or not.Everything I have read states without doubt that using extacy is extremely dangerous for a type 1 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0When high on this or any other drug, you cannot possibly think clearly enough to manage either low or high blood sugar levels. If you intentionally raise your sugar levels in order to protect yourself from possible hypoglycemia, your body suffers the damaging effects of the high levels until you are aware enough to be able to logically do the math to take insulin to bring those levels down. Many young people assume that they have YEARS before they face any possible complications, but my work with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation has put me in touch with numbers of young people who already have complications and who would give their eyeteeth, so to speak, to have the ability to go back in time a few years to tighten up their control so that the high levels don't happen at all. I know people between the ages of 18-26 who have diabetic cataracts, horrible gastroparesis (inability to digest food because of damage to the nerves in the digestive tract) and failing kidneys. Please don't take your current good health for granted!With proper tight control of your glucose numbers, you don't HAVE to suffer complications, but you need to keep your brain focused in order to do that hour-to-hour tightrope walk and not go too low or too high.I am not writing this to try to preach to you. I write because I am so touched by these young people who contact us after developing these scary complications. And because I care, I must make you aware of the fact that this CAN happen to young people who live out-of-control lives in the diabetic arena. At least if you decide to take any kind of drugs, you do so knowing what you risk.As for protecting yourself if you choose to use this drug, really the only thing you CAN do is to deliberately raise your glucose levels by eating by eating more than usual and then HOPE that you guessed correctly. If your glucose levels are very high, you are going to feel bad (possible headache, thirst, buzz in head, and upset stomach) and of course each hour that your sugar levels are elevated, tiny blood vessels can be damaged. The best way to protect yourself is to tell your friends that you wish to live long and prosper and then volunteer to be their designated driver.If you feel that you cannot do this, then you may have some emotional issues that need to be dealt with, for a clear-headed person can certainly have as much fun out on the town as one who is high on a drug. If all of your friends will be taking extacy and none of your party plan to be sober, then you certainly should get a MedicAlert bracelet or necklace (you can usually get them at any local pharmacy) and make sure that you list that you are a type 1 diabetic and list your insulin dosage and time on the little enclosed card. Also, keep a card in your purse in an easy-to-reach place with your doctor's name and this same information so that if you should pass out from low or high blood sugar, the EMT squad won't have to guess at what is wrong with you. You absolutely need to tell SOMEONE who is sober that you are a type 1 diabetic, for most people would simply assume that you are drunk if you pass out, and would leave you to sleep it off, which could kill you if you have fallen into a hypoglycemic or hyperglycemic coma.",

            "answer": "Please, please do not take this step in your life!\u00a0\u00a0I will unashamedly beg you to rethink what you are about to do.\u00a0\u00a0My diabetic son took the drug path and died two years ago as a result. His drug use (Ecstasy, cocaine, etc.) accelerated his diabetic complications three fold.\u00a0\u00a0In the end, when he died, he was alone, blind, and in kidney and heart failure.\u00a0\u00a0We (his family) wasn't even able to be with him when he died because the drugs took control of him to the point he did not have good judgment and we had no idea where he was.\u00a0\u00a0We were never able to extract him from the drug way of life.\u00a0\u00a0Please think of your family before you do something that truly will affect you the rest of your life.\u00a0\u00a0Please think of your own value to this world before you do something that truly will harm you for the rest of your life.\u00a0\u00a0Please think of your future spouse and children before you do something that truly will prevent you from having your own family.\u00a0\u00a0Please think about what you will miss most if you do something that will harm you forever.\u00a0\u00a0I care, please think again.",

            "answer": "Hi I'm writing because I have a brother that is 20 years old and has had diabetes for about 10 years. Since he has turned 18 he has taken many different drugs and i've always told him I worry about him and it's natural because I'm his big sister.\u00a0\u00a0He is not addicted to any drugs but the one drug that worries my the most is Extacy. I know he goes to raves sometimes and I'm just wondering how dangerous this could be to his health. I have talked to him about making sure he drinks lots of water when he goes to these raves but what else could I do to help him. Everybody keeps telling me that he's old enough to make his own decisions so I don't want to nag to much. I've actually gone with him the last few times because I worry so much. If anything ever happened I don't think his friends would know what to do. Help!",

            "answer": "I'm sorry if this comes across rude but it has to be said. i have been a diabetic for 17 years i am now 20. since i was about 16 i have continued to look for advice about taking drugs. not that i want to get into them just incase i ever just wanted to try them. Every one says, dont take them, there dangerous for people with out and illness but even more so for people with diabetes. we know all this. we know they can kill not only diabetics but any one for that matter. All we want is someone who is a diabetic to give us some advice if we want to take extacy or something else. Some one who has tried and who is a diabetic. We want to know what happened, how they handled taking something like that and how it affected there diabetes.Diabetics will take drugs, but if we had this advice at least in a way we know what to expect. Everyone needs to pull their heads and stop telling us no because we already know we shouldn't and telling us what to expect if we do.",

            "answer": "I am a diabetic, in recovery and a substance abuse counselor. I can see this topic from many facets. I would say make an informed choice. Drugs are risky for anyone, theire use comes at a high cost no matter what, but especially for a diabetic.Anyone using substances runs the risk of dependency and addiction. Even when entered into \"innocently\"\u00a0\u00a0lines get crossed and the option for choice is no longer available. I am a firm believer that there are always underlying emotional reasons for our use, if we were content or happy with where we are we would not feel a need to alter our state, or need to feel differently. Maybe that would be a good place to start asking questions, why is where I am at, mentally or emotionally, in need of being altered?If you feel a need to \"experience\" drugs then you will do so, but I would suggest that it only be after you have done some research and informed yourself as to what your \"costs\" will truely be, it is never \"free\". Find out what consequences you will have to live with after the fact, what may seem\u00a0\u00a0like a couple of \"fun\" adventures, could cost you mentally, emotionally and absolutely physically.I have had many friends as diabetics lose their lives to drug use, the kidneys of a diabetic cannot withstand the burden of clearing the toxins of drugs or alcohol from our systems. We do not heal as readily as others and the mental and emotional burdens of drug use are compounded on top of the already high rate of depression that diabetics suffer from anyway.My heart goes out to the young person who asks this question, and anyone else suffering from the devestating disease of addiction. God Bless.",

    "question": "This weekend I am going to take exctacy with a friend of mine, I have not taken this drug since I have been diagnosed with diabetes. I was wondering what I need to do to make sure I will be ok. I use novorapid and have about 14 before dinner, about four hours after dinner I will probably eat more food like a sandwich, take exctacy and go to town.",
