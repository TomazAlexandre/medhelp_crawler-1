            "answer": "Hello,If there is itching on different parts of body and there is no rash, it can be due to internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, diabetes, iron deficiency anemia, irritation and allergic reactions to chemicals, wool, soaps, cosmetics and certain foods\u00a0\u00a0can cause itchy skin.You can apply an anti-itch cream or lotion to the affected area. Oral antihistamine, such as Benadryl can also be used. You should take a comfortably cool bath and wear smooth-textured cotton clothing. Covering the affected area with bandages and dressings can help protect the skin and prevent scratching. You should choose mild soaps without dyes or perfumes and use a mild, unscented laundry detergent when washing clothes, towels and bedding.Please take a second opinion from a dermatologist if the symptoms persist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",

    "question": "HiMy problem started 3 days ago. I found that I was waking up itching the other night on my chest, I presumed it was just dry skin or heat, but the itching has got worse and worse and spread to my entire body. Scalp, neck, back chest etc - all over.Have tried Piriton & Eurax cream to no avail, doc prescribed cetrizine anti allgery tabs & calamine lotion. These have had no effect at all.This is my 2nd night up with no chance of sleep. The itching is driving me insane & I cannot sleep at all. I drift off and the itching wakes me up. I have read a few posts and some people are saying they have similar symptoms & have never found an answer or cure! I cannot go on with this itching & no sleep.I thought maybe I had reacted to Stevia, but I haven't had any since yesterday morning so I would have thought it would be out of my system by now.I don't think this is an allergic reaction as there is no rash to speak of, only lumps from where I have been scratching.It's getting worse.Please help!Louise",
