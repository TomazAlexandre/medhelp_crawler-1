    "question": "I seek suggestions on living w/IBD and and Diabetes... Four yrs. ago, I was diagnosed with crohns/ulcerative colitis. After a yr. of no symptons, I thought I was cured! (occassionally, some foods caused cramps and diarrea,(lasting only a few hrs.) So I never refilled the asacol. Three yrs. later, the IBD is back and WORSE than before! This flare up begun 6 mos. ago. I didn't know the disease could go in remission!\u00a0\u00a0Mornings are horrible! It's HRS. B/4 I can go anywhere or feel better. Diarrea, blood and nausea, sometimes, I barely make it to the bathroom. And when I eat, it starts all over again. On a good day, these episodes are over after about 4 trips to toilet. (or about an hr.) Any more than that, guaranteed to see blood.) During my 3 yr. remission period, I learned I'm a diabetic.(pills only, no insullin) This poses another problem, If I eat, I get sick, if I don't, sugarvgets too low. Below 80, I feel it. Within 10-20 min. it drops so low, so FAST, you won't be able to walk/drive, become confused and can go in a coma. I've become so frustrated and depressed.Having either, one, IBD or DIABETES, lowers your immune system. It can take mos. to heal from flu,cuts etc.! (This past summer, I was on antibiotics 3 mos!) I am at witts end, not knowing what to do/eat. Can't make plans, cuz you never know from day to day how you're going to feel. And nothings more embarrassing than to be in public, and unable to get to a restroom. Once you feel the cramp, it's usually too late! ALWAYS bring spare clothes, and something to clean yourself with!!!",
