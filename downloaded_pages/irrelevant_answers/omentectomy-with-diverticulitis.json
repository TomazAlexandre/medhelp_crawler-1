            "answer": "May I ask why you'd like to have your omentum removed? I know most people think of it as being only a fatty blanket, but it's more than that. It serves a very important immune function. In addition, it's a big help in 'walling off' site of problems in the case of infections, etc.",

            "answer": "My husband has been \"ill\" for over two years. One thing we have definitely confirmed is early stages of Diastolic Congestive Heart Disease. He has been tested with blood work, urinalysis, CT scans, cardiac cath, MRI's and the list goes on. Everything, with the exception of the DCHD, comes back normal, or negative for disease. He also has Type 2 diabetes, and is on Metformin.\u00a0\u00a0He has had a work up at the MAYO CLINIC and at NIH, in Bethesda, MD, and we are now exactly where we started...... no clue which way to go. His symptoms start with shortness of breath with minimal activity, then he must sit, and pain starts in his thighs. I am sending this to you, as today a light bulb went on for me, and I am wondering if his \"beer keg\" shaped abdomen could be a symptom of something that is being missed. He is 58 y.o. and was overly active until whatever this is, knocked him off his feet and he has been unable to work since. Could you provide any suggestions? He is not overweight. 5' 7.5\", 169 lbs. Non-smoker, non-drinker. Thank you so much for reading this. I can be reached at ***@****\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Susan",
