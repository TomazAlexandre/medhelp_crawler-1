            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!There are many causes for ridges on the toes nails such as eczema, lichen planus, dermatitis, peripheral vascular disease, psoriasis, fungal infection, and Raynaud\u2019s disease. Since you all have numbness, shooting pains, forgetfulness, arm and leg weakness and fatigue chances of Raynaud\u2019s disease and other peripheral vascular diseases should be ruled out. Diabetes, smoking, high lipids and high blood pressure are some of the causes of peripheral vascular diseases. Please discuss this with an internal medicine specialist and a skin specialist. Hope this helps. Take care!",
