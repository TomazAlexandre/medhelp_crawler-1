            "answer": "Hello,high blood sugars over extended period of time can cause nervous system damage.\u00a0\u00a0What you describe could be from that, or could also be from gastroparesis, or other cuase.The most important and critical thing to do is to get your blood sugars back to normal range (this is ideally < 140 at all times, and even bette if in the range of 80 - 120).If you cannot do this with diet and exercise and oral meds then you should use insulin to achieve this.Many of the complications of uncontrolled diabetes can be reversed in time if the blood sugars are normalised.Read the following books as well:diabetes solutions: Dr. Richard BernsteinBlood sugar 101.You do need to see a dr and get on top of this immediately.\u00a0\u00a0You can do it!\u00a0\u00a0The complications of diabetes are not inevitable, and diabetes can be controlled (yes, it takes hard work).",

            "answer": "Hi Sally - are you saying that blood sugar levels are too high if they are over 140 after eating a meal?\u00a0\u00a0Just curious because I finally got my blood sugar under 100 in the mornings, but I think it may be getting higher than 140 after meals.\u00a0\u00a0Two hours after meals it is under 115.\u00a0\u00a0I do not take any medications at this time.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your input, Julie",

            "answer": "Yes,\u00a0\u00a0the recommendation is not to allow blood sugars to go over 140 at any time and even better if you can stay below 120.The best way to acheive this (other than insulin) is to carefully choose what you eat at meals and to strictly limit the amount of carbs that you eat.\u00a0\u00a0Most of your carbs should come from non-starchy vegetables and maybe a little from dairy. Avoid grains and fruits (there is nothing nutrition wise in fruits that can't be found in a selection of vegetables - the only difference is that fruits are sweet - and it is the sugar you would want to avoid).I can't tell you what to eat, but you need to test after each meal (1 1/2 - 2 hours) and see what your blood sugar is and then adjust what you eat accordingly until you are on target.",

    "question": "I am a type 2 diabetic whose blood sugar has been high for a long while. I am looking into seeing a new dr and I have to work on eating better and losing weight. I'm on two meds that can elevate blood sugar. For the past 6 months I have been having trouble emptying my bladder completely, I get dizzy at times and once in awhile my heart feels like it is not beating right. For some time now I am also having trouble with swallowing, food coming up and food getting stuck in my throat and heartburn. I am worried and will have to get this checked out. I'm scared by some of the things I have read. Has anyone had experience with this and do you know what the prognosis is? Thank you.",
