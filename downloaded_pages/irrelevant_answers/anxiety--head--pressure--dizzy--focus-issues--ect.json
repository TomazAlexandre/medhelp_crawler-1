            "answer": "Hey man sorry to hear about the problems u have. I'm no pro but I would say keep taking the zoloft it worked for me when I was going through my anxiety issues. If your dr told u not to worry they're professionals and they studied medz for years to provide health care for all. I don't think your doctor will tell you that there is nothing to worry about when there is something really wrong with u. Relax, take the zoloft and be strong for u and your son. Wish u all the best",

            "answer": "thanks man. That means a lot. I mean you'd think being diagnosed with type 1 diabetes when youre 25 would be hard enough, but then compile it with the already diagnosed anxiety depression. It gets difficult to deal with.",

    "question": "Where to start? Well I'm a 27 year old male. Just turned 27. I have been battling depression / anxiety for years un-medicated. A few years back my doctor put me on zoloft. I had been taking 100mg for the past 4 years and gained about 30 lbs within a few monthsbut it stopped my panic attacks. I also quit smoking about the same time. Two years back I was diagnosed with type one diabetes. I am now insulin dependent. About 4 days ago I realized that I also have a serious problem with binge drinking. Every night for the last 2-3 years I drink alcohol. A really significant amount of it. I thought it was the only thing that really calmed my nerves. Three months ago I (without a doctor) cut my zoloft back to 50mg. It was rough at first, I was irritable and snappy. Then it got easier but still I would drink all night. NEVER during the day. Recently I lost some weight. (about 8 - 10 lbs I assume from the cut in zoloft) My wife gave birth to a beautiful baby boy 3 months ago and my life has changed. I adore him and want to be around for as long as I can for him. I have not had a drink in 4 days and it has been awesome, but I have another problem. Recently, I have been dizzy and not really feeling like myself. I had a complete nervous breakdown 3 nights ago. I literally curled up into a ball and cried. I feel like I have a serious illness. Now, last night and today I have a pressure in my head, and a feeling like I have to crack my neck. My left eye (which is always blurry due to astigmatism) has become bothersome. As if I notice the blurriness more. I feel like I'm falling in reverse sometimes. I went to the doctor when I first got a bit dizzy and she told me I'm crazy for cutting my dose in half and I replied, \"believe me thats the least of my craziness\". She told me to stop screwing around and take the 100mg. I have yet to be honest about my drinking problem with anyone except for my wife and my mother. Cutting out alcohol has been the easiest thing I've dealt with in the last few days and I am determined to not drink again. In the meantime (since zoloft takes a week or two to set in) my doc told me to take xanex as needed. I have been taking xanex ONLY when 100% necessary. The last thing I need is a xanex addiction. I am afraid to die. I always have been. Its on my mind often. I just want my head pressure, dizziness and worry to go away. I want to enjoy life with my baby boy and worry about him and not me. It seems impossible to keep negative thoughts out of my head right now and this pressure / dizziness is driving me nuts. My doctor said she isn't concerned and I should just give it time. Meanwhile, I literally just had a panic attack and I'm at work and need to WORK!.",
