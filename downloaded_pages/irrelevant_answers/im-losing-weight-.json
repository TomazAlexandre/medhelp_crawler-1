    "question": "I'm a 5'9\" male who weighs 145 pounds, does not smoke, drinks occasionally and has always been thin.\u00a0\u00a0I take no medications.\u00a0\u00a0 I noticed my weight has seemed to dropped down about 8 or so pounds within the year.\u00a0\u00a0I was weighing around 152 pounds through the year of 2017.\u00a0\u00a0I went to my new family doctor back in December of 2016 and he ran a full blood work up since I was a new patient. His nurse called me and said everything looked good and to come back in a year for a regular check up.\u00a0\u00a0I decided after my Doctors appointment to pull out the nutri bullet and started drinking raw vegetables (leafy greens, broccoli, cauliflower, carrots and a garlic clove).\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to stay healthy.\u00a0\u00a0I have been doing this off and on most of the year, as well as, I have been drinking 3 glasses of green tea a day too. I have not been consistent but I have done it most of the year.\u00a0\u00a0For about 2 weeks starting a month ago I also took cinnamon tablets and for a week I took holy basil tablets.\u00a0\u00a0About 6 weeks ago I noticed my pants felt loose and a friend told me I looked thinner. I cut out the whole health thing and for the past few weeks I'm trying to eat anything to put weight back on.\u00a0\u00a0Everything I google says Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Does this sound like something I should be concerned about?",
