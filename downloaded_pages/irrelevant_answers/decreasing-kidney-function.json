    "question": "Hi,Thanks for providing this forum :)My egfr has gone down over the past 11 months from 65 to 54 (I am a 58 year old woman)I haven had blood in my urine constantly for at least the past 11 months - the level of that has gone from 27 erethrocytes to 109.My doc sent me to a nephrologist who says I have nephritis of unknown origin, and wants me to wait several months to \"see what happens\".My local doc also said my calcium levels are a bit out of order too - but he didn't seem too worried about that.I am unhappy about waiting.What do you think I ought to do?Thanks.:)",
