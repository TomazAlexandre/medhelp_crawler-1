            "answer": "I have been told by my cardiologist that I have a mitral valve prolapse. I am a 34 year old female, 5ft 9in tall and 135lbs. Is it possible to feel this prolapse? Sometimes when I am tired or trying to sleep I can feel something in my chest. It is hard to explain but it feels something like a faucet being turned on then briefly being turned off then on again. Could this be my mitral valve prolapse and should I be concerned?Thanks,MLC",

I get these weird symptoms that I havent seen so far in the forum. I get really hot and severly sweaty then my heart starts to beat really fast my vision starts to fade (all gray and fuzzy) nausea comes on and I feel really faint. I also have stomach problems.
