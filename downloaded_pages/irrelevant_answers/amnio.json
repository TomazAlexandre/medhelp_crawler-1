He's one of those that thinks pregnant women should get every test known to man while pregnant.

He got a little pissy when I told him I didn't wantthe test done.\ufeffthe other test test for abnormalities and down syndrom so I don't see the point with an amnio if the others test for thesame\u00a0\u00a0thing.",
