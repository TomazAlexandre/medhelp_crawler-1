            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear about this. One possibility is ankylosing spondylitis. Back pain worse when sitting or lying down and feels better with movement is usually caused by ankylosing spondylitis. This is a genetic condition. Medicines, physiotherapy, exercises and drugs to suppress immunity are the mainstay of treatment. It can also be widespread osteoarthritis. Vit D , calcium, parathyroid and thyroid gland function, and low estrogen too could be a cause. There are chest and neck braces which you can wear and probably surgery will help to some extent. Please discuss with a spine specialist. Take care!",

            "answer": "No it is not genetic, not osteoarthritis. what kind of surgery are you talking about, that will help? vitamin d levels are fine-others not sure. Pain is not worse when i lie down, and there really is no back pain-large muscles with little back pain.thank youcandyce",

    "question": "In May 2009 I woke up fine, about an hour later got extreme headache starting in neck and going up -could not think straight normal functions were hard to perform-got through day until early evening and about 2 or 3 pm my arms and legs began cramping so bad i could hardly move-fast forward-been to numerous doctors and clinics-no findings except definitely not autoimmune disorder-nerve damage in lower legs and feet comparitive to someone with diabetes-i do not have diabetes-since then i am only able to walk normally with rest-headaches frequently-pins and needles in legs and arms-most days unable to do simple leg raise when laying down-anytime on feet drops my ability to walk my walk was described by a rheumatologist as a trendelenburg gait which others have agreed with-but do alright with rest. My latest MRI shows medium size left paramidline focal disc protrusion/herniation at the c5-c6 level causing mild left ventral thecal sac deformity. Minimal disc bulging demonstrated at c2-c3,c3-c4,c4-c5,and c6-c7. L4-L5 mild or early disc degenration. t11-t12 level, small right sided disc protrusion causes mild right ventral thecal sac deformity. Most days if I cannot walk i have little pain just pins needles constant numbness-arms and legs are affected with this. when my walking gets better the pain is there-muscle cramps in thighs shoulders neck, etc. do no know what to do-wonder if maybe this is extreme spinal stenosis? i am 38 years old and have had no other major problems or illnesses-only take trazadone for sleep and darvocet when absolutely needed-have been diagnosed with central sensitization syndrome and fibromyalgia-most days just deal with the pain and aggervation but the inability to walk is very disheartening. Still work as a high school teacher -have been told by doctors most people who have the problems i have would not work but still no answers.",
