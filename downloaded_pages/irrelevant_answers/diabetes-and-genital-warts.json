            "answer": "I don't think diabetes has an effect on the clearance of warts. However I think diabetes can weaken the immune system (although I'm not completely sure) and a weak immune system has an effect on how easily the warts clear.But also stress can really aggrivate the virus and although it's hard you have to relax as stressing yourself out does more harm than good.You have to be patient also, you were only diagnosed 2 months ago, once you've had no symptoms for 6-24 months you can start assuming you are clear but a lot of people have 2 or 3 outbreaks before they are clear. Just let time take it's course and you will be fine. Stay healthy and relaxed",
