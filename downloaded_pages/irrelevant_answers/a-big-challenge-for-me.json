            "answer": "Yes, Im 15w 3d. I have lost 5kg in just the last month.I\u00a0\u00a0just had dinner with my family. Im trying to eat more like they want me to. I dished myself up 2 servings of stirfry ( rice, hamburg, veggies) I could only handle half of it then my tummy started to hurt. Im not allowed any sugars and have to be careful of what fruits I eat. I so cheet by eating lots of green veggies as they are sugar free. Though its not enough, I have to now add protein (my family has always eaten meat sparingly) and more grains. So red meat, fish, eggs, peanut butter, nuts; and for grains I have to start eating breads and oatmeal and things like that. 6 months ago I cut my family off of gluten as foundout that it effects my oldest son (possible allergy,\u00a0\u00a0he is alergect to barley and a few other grains that contain gluten). So I got kudos for doing will with the other food groups,\u00a0\u00a0though I was told it is not enough for my babies. If I dont get my calories up my milk will stop producing and my baby in my belly will not develop right. Im totaly freaked about it now. So im going to do my best at trying to eat more. After todays attempt. I tgink my next meal I will try a serving and a half. When that dose not hurt my tummy I will up it again.In my first 2 pregnancies I lost aprox 25-30lbs in each, do to my diabetic problem. With my last pregnancy I gained 35lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Im not sure what 5kg is in lbs but they sure made ot sound like its a big dealThank you ladies,\u00a0\u00a0for your suport.\u00a0\u00a0This is a hard challenge for me to do.",

            "answer": "This morning I testes my blood at 10am it read\u00a0\u00a0a nice 5.7 I then had a bowl of cereal and an hr latter when I was making my kids a snack, I was all yum well if my sugars ar low enough I can have some too, specialy at the doc wants me to eat more. Well at 11:30 my sugars read 10.5 no snack for me. Guess im going to have to re-figure out a breakfast food for myself, cereal is too much. Greef its hard enough for me to eat and make sure I do then to figure out what works for my sugars. Ive had this eat more carbs challenge for less then a day and I cant seam to eat more and keep my sugars down. Im feeling frustrated",

    "question": "I had my first appointment at the diabetic clinic today. They are concerned as I am still losing weight. As I am still nursing my last baby, my callories need to be higher. Infact they want me to take in double the amount of callories as I am now. I said that I will try and I will. Its going to be a real challenge for me, as I do have an eating disorder, ive been battling anorexia for over 15years.\u00a0\u00a0Ive been good lately making sure to eating everyday, brunch and dinner as well as some snacks. Now I need to eat more as both my babies need more. All I know is im going to be so sick though my babies need me to eat more. Trick is to eat more without it affecting my blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0I could really use some cheering on and encouragement. Gole set forward is to eat more protein and grains. I usually eat fresh produce and dairy.\u00a0\u00a0Time for more changes to my diet, not easy to do.",
