    "question": "found out I am Strep B+ today.My doctor said that everything should be fine as long as I get the penicillin when I go to the hospital, making sure I go right away once I have contractions or my water breaks.Does everyone get tested between 35-37 Weeks? I read a little bit online and it says you could get the fetus infected while your pregnant but there is a low chance. So I was wondering why they wouldn't check earlier in your pregnancy.I am not too worried about it though because I have heard enough times that mothers babies comes out fine.But now I have another concern. I wanted to go natural, not having all of those stupid I.V's in me, but now I need to get one for sure, is that a disadvantage? Like I want to be able to walk around, take a shower or a bath and just really not wait around in bed.Does getting that during labour make you drowsy or anything. I am going to hate it :(. I am totally not into getting an Epidural either, and wanting to avoid other drugs because of the drowsiness effect it could possibly give on my baby, making breastfeeding take longer.But anyways now because of this I feel like my labour is totally changed around than what I have hoped for.Oh and another thing. My friend had it and when she had her baby just recently she said they had to say an extra day or so because they had to test the baby after he was born and had to wait for the results.But my doctor said that I wont have to worry about staying an extra day as long as I am doing perfectly fine and I don't have the baby sooner than expected.It just sound so weird, but is it just because different doctors/hospitals aren't ever the same, different hospital/doctors are always different??",
