I've become allergic to sugar and salts. I'm done. No more takeaways or pizzas. Its healthy living from now on. I just wished I hadn't disregarded it all months ago.

The doctor put it down to stress, but I still can't eat what I want. I can't eat carbs. I can't even eat brown bread otherwise the symptoms would flare back up.I left the GP feeling embarrassed for being silly, but wtf? So great I don't have Diabetes. I ate brown bread and I didn't feel anything for a while. I went to sleep and I felt all the symptoms a patient with neuropathy felt. Dark thoughts descend. Why...why I'm I feeling this way. I'm too embarrassed to even go back.",

    "question": "HiI'm a 29 y o male from UK England and I've been having cold tingling sensations on my hands and feet and upper arms which usually goes way after meals.I've been to see the doctor and he sent me to have a blood test to see if I have diabetes. Well that was back in March. I know very foolish. Now its becoming more serve. It just won't stop. I haven't eaten all day and still I'm getting these sensations.Its not painful, but its a constant reminder of that I have to live with this condition for the rest of my life. I know I haven't been tested for the condition, but when you know, you know. Writing's on the wall. I'm only 29 and I thought diabetic neuropathy was exclusive to the 40s and over age group, is it not? This complication only comes about with someone who has managed the condition poorly for a number of years. Is there a set number or is it varied?In any case, I'm seriously going to bring this under control to avoid any further complications. I'm just worried I may have done irreparable damage and something like an amputation of my limbs or worse is to come sooner.I'm going for my blood test tomorrow and I haven't eaten all day long. I'll have to keep this up now till after the test tomorrow. Grr.",
