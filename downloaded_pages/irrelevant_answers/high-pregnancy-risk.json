            "answer": "I'm considered high risk due to kidney and gall stones. Taking the prenatal vitamins will cause me to develop large kidney stones because of the calcium in them. Also when your hormone levels raise during pregnancy they speed up the growth of gall stones. At anytime of the pregnancy I can have my kidneys shut down from a kidney stone that is to large to pass and an infection will develop. Also have a gall stone get to large and block off the gall bladder to the pancreas. I would have to have surgery if either one happened!There are many reason women are classified as high risk! Gene disorder, being to small to carry baby to full term, blood pressure, diabetes, and so on! The list is huge and some risks are bigger then others in each doctors book! Most likely the doctor will tell you why you are high risk.",
