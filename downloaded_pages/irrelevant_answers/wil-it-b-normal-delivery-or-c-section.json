            "answer": "You are full term at 38 weeks. High BP can be stress, diet, gestational diabetes, pre-eclampsia. There is no way to say whether you will end up with a c-section or not unless it's already preplanned. Many people get induced and do a vaginal delivery others don't.",

            "answer": "The risks of induction are that it increases your chances of needing an emergency c-section. Also induction might fail (small failure rate which means that even with the measures it takes to induce labor you don't go into labor).I wouldn't induce before 39 weeks unless you are diagnosed as pre-eclamptic or have more blood pressure issues.If you want a vaginal birth ask that they break your water first before introducing Pitocin or any other synthetic hormones.",
