            "answer": "I would think something along the lines of a thyroid problem (hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism). The question after that, however, becomes: \"Why are the thyroids acting weird?\". Since there was also spleen involvement, it is possible that that this could be due to a chronic infection of some type - but could also be due to pancreatic function impairment. But, really, first step I would take is to ask the doctor to assess his thyroid function; after that, additional things can be brought up or ruled out.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Usually conditions of heart, kidney, liver or low protein or severe anemia, which cause ankle and feet swelling, cause both ankles and feet to swell. Hence you will need to get heart function assessed by ECHO and EKG, get kidney and liver function tests done and get a complete blood picture for anemia. Low sodium in blood, hypothyroidism and malabsorption syndromes causing low protein in blood have to be looked into.Some of it has been investigated. Liver and kidney function needs to be assessed through blood tests. It can even be infection of the lymphatics.Please discuss with your husband\u2019s treating doctor. Hope he gets well soon!Take care!",

    "question": "My husband's legs (below the knees), ankles and feet are extremely swollen on both sides.\u00a0\u00a0He mentioned that they have slowly been growing larger for the last three months, but have become extreme in the past week.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor also noticed that his right testicle is about 25% larger than the left.\u00a0\u00a0He weighs about 150 and is 63 years old.\u00a0\u00a0So far they have done a few ultrasounds and have found no blood clots.\u00a0\u00a0They have also tested his heart and said that it is good.\u00a0\u00a0Yesterday they did an ultrasound of his abdomen, but we have not heard any results of that, but last February he did have a ruptured spleen which they allowed to heal on its own (not sure if this is relevant).Do you have any thoughts of what it could be because I was unable to find these symptoms anywhere online.",
