            "answer": "Here is some more useful information that might be of help!I had a CT scan on my brain done back in December with no problems. I also had an MRI of my brain in January of 2009 after what the doctors thought might have been a TIA due to use of combined birth control pills. They did not find anything on that MRI either. However, I have never had an MRI of my spine. Back in November, I also had a D-dimer test and my values were apparently borderline and they did a venous doppler of my leg, looking for blood clots, which they also found nothing. I have had the Mirena IUD for two months now and I have not had any problems with it, but I have had quite a history with female hormones. Both sides of my family have a history of heart disease and stroke as well as diabetes.",

    "question": "I am a 20 year old, relatively healthy female. I am 5' 6\" and weight about 165 lbs. The only known medical problems I have are kidney stones and general anxiety disorder.The pins and needles feeling started on my right side shoulder blade. It was very rare (it only happened once or twice monthly for a few hours). Recently, however, I have noticed that I get the pins and needles in other parts of my body on the same side and the pins and needles feeling is constant in my shoulder blade. I have been feeling it in my face and my leg and foot for the past few days. I have also been having transient back pain. I went to the Urgent Care yesterday and they prescribed me Prednisone and a muscle relaxer, which I am quite nervous to take. I started the Prednisone today.\u00a0\u00a0I have had my blood tested many times and I do not have diabetes or HIV. Most doctors have been putting it off on my anxiety, but I am not convinced this is all in my head. Please help!",
