            "answer": "Since this is your first pregnancy, I would not get induced. Inducing will make the contractions way more intense than if you go naturally. I don't know what you're planning as far as pain management (like an epidural or iv drugs) but I would wait for the labor to happen naturally since you don't know to expect yet. I know it's hard waiting but your baby is going to come soon. It's just not ready yet.",

Going to 42 weeks the placenta starts to deteriorate,\u00a0\u00a0which is why it's medically necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Let it happen and enjoy the anticipation of labor. I know a lot of women who wish they had gotten to experience that.",
