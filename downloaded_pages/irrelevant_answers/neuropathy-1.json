            "answer": "Thank you for replying. My neuro said I have merliga parenthesis in my thighs, and feels its caused by tight jeans. This assessment took me by surprise because I have been wearing the same jeans for years. He said that the vit d deficiency could have triggered the femoral nerve to become trapped. When I asked him about the pain in my arms he said I have slight carprl tunnel, but he feels its also from low d. I can't begin to tell you how worried I have been. I have been tested for hiv probably 20 times over the last five months. I tested so many times because everytime I googled neuropathy hiv or diabetes would pop up. BTW... All my hiv tests were negative. I even had an RNA test done to confirm I was hiv negative. My A1C came back normal also. I just feel like I have been through an emotional roller coaster. I still am blow away that low d can cause neuropathy type symptoms. My emg was normal in my thighs. Anyway thanks again for confirming low vit d can cause neuropathy type symptoms.",
