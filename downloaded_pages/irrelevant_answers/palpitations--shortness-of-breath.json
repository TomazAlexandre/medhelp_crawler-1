    "question": "Hi, I'm a 60-year old man with Type II diabetes. I have trouble sleeping for more than 3-4 hours at a time, so I just grab some sleep whenever I feel tired enough. This often means that I take a nap in the late afternoon and then go to bed at 1-2 in the morning or even later.About once a month I start getting palpitations the minute my head hits the pillow. When I do, they generally last about 4-5 hours. They seem to be accompanied by irregular heartbeat, I assume, since when I try to take my pulse there isn't a steady rhythm.What concerns me today is that I also seem to have shortness of breath. I just took out the garbage cans, normally an easy enough job, and when I got back I had pains in my shoulders and shortness of breath.My next doctor's appointment is in January. What I'm wondering is whether it's OK to wait until then, or whether a trip to the emergency room is called for.I have no previous history of heart problems and my last stress test (a year and a half ago) turned up negative.Thanks for your help.",
