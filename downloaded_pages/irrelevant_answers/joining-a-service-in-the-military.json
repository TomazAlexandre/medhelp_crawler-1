            "answer": "I have heard from other young adults who were disappointed because they were not allowed to join the military, and I understand your concerns and your anger. However, as a type 1 diabetic spouse of an Air Force officer, I know the policies well, and actually agree with them.Any person who joins the Active Duty forces MUST be able to be deployed to any region at all wtihout thought of whether they can have their medical supplies shipped safely to this region. The military cannot accept anyone who is unable to live in tough condtions, possibly WITHOUT medications. While even the most remote camps do have a medic available, shipping supplies in war areas can be unreliable, and they cannot be responsible for your life if a vial of insulin is broken and no replacement is available or if you become separated from your medical supplies by battle or capture. Also, if you are high or low and not at the top of your physical abilities, your inability to function at maximum potential could endanger the lives of your buddies in a war situation, for during a battle. In the heat of things, the carbs you need to balance insulin may just not be available when you need them. If low, you may not have access to juice or candy that you sorely need to regain your optimum strength and coordination. This becomes not just a matter of convenience, but a matter of life and death, not only for you, but for those who count on you to help keep them out of harm's way.Here is my suggestion: MANY of the jobs that used to be Active Duty positions have been outsourced these days and made into civilian jobs. These jobs are open to diabetics as well as anyone else. I personally have held a civilian job, creating animations and graphics for pilot training courseware for the AIr Force, and can speak firsthand about the satisfaction of doing this kind of work that has a direct bearing on the welfare of our military. You can find out what kinds of civilian jobs are available by going to the web site of any military base.You and I both know that with our insulin, we are as strong and active as anyone else, but the very fact that this insulin is needed to keep us alive is not negotiable with any armed services. But, being married to a military guy for 25 years, I have seen first-hand how many military slots are now civilian, for outsourcing is the way the military has been able to function with its still huge job while numbers are being cut. I would go to the nearest military base's Human Resources Office and see what is available in the way of civilian employment. I think you will be surprised in a good way. Pay and benifits are usually good, and these civilian contract companies are eager to have employees who want to put their energies into being a partner to the military Active Duty forces.Sometimes we need to be flexible enough to find our dreams where our dreams present themselves rather than being unhappy if doors close in areas where we think we would be most satisified. I do wish you the very best in finding the right spot for you.",

            "answer": "Ok OK so they dont want to put up with a diabetics liablity factor. But what about hospital military jobs and facility jobs in the state. I mean i would be happy doing the least common military job just to be in. I see that i am stuggling with a dead end subject but just seem like someone could do somethign and change the military. The military over the years has allways evolved from its original guidelines and protocols and seems to me they could spend some time and figure this out!",

            "answer": "Those non-combat jobs are just what I am talking of being outsourced so much nowadays. As a case in point, my husband, a colonel, has a BOSS who is a civilian! Truly you should check out the civilian side of the military, for many of the jobs that were active duty jobs just a few years ago are now civilian jobs. OK, so they don't wear the uniform. But it is hard for me to believe that the uniform is your sole reason for wanting to do this. I would like to hope that your main reason is the mission of service to our nation. Civilian guys are now repairing airplanes, doing hospital work, doctoring most of us in the military (very few of our doctors are actually active duty now), handling the support operations, communications offices, etc. I have personally known two civilians whose jobs were the same as that of a squadron commander -- these guys had replaced the active duty squadron commanders! So they had active duty folks working under them. Odd, I know. But that's the way the structure is these days. At our last base, over a thousand jobs were civilian jobs instead of military, and the active duty military forces were actually the minority of folks working on the base. DO check it out. The military as a whole is now a real team effort between the few active duty folks we are allowed by budget and the civilian folks who do the jobs that used to be military jobs.",

Thats just plain boring and\u00a0\u00a0yes part of me being in the military is getting the uniform gaining ranks serving the country as a Military personel instead of a wanabe who because of medical issues has to be a helper of the military just for the money and no honor or service!! I dont know I see how its a dead end but i wish just before i turn like 25 i could become a part of the U.S. military team.",

            "answer": "Well - unfortunately, that is the way it is.\u00a0\u00a0The military requires healthy, able bodied men and women.\u00a0\u00a0They do not want to have to be concerned about special needs when you have to be deployed at a minute's notice.\u00a0\u00a0I come from an Air Force and Army military family - I know first hand.Diabetes, like any other lifelong chronic health condition, will exclude you from active military service. (Forget about getting a private or commerical pilot's license too - Diabetes is on the FAA's physical exam's list of disqualifications.)\u00a0\u00a0It stinks, it makes you feel like a non contributor .... but someone else will have to stand on the wall and defend you.And this is not just in the United States ....Was reading recently at pumpers.org where a Royal Canadian Air Force Officer / Fighter Pilot went to his base hospital with the classic symptoms of frequent urination and thirst.\u00a0\u00a0The base doctor told him the bad news that he was DM Type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Pilot goes .... \"but I'm a Pilot!\"\u00a0\u00a0The doctor goes, \"Your *were* a pilot, now you're a Type 1 diabetic.\"\u00a0\u00a0He served the rest of commission behind a desk and was discharged.There are many civilian jobs in the military though, equally or more important than shouldering a weapon.\u00a0\u00a0But - if you're after a stripe on your shoulder, the reality is, they (those who would be your fellow soldiers) don't want you out there with them.\u00a0\u00a0You're a liability and liabilities can get them killed.:^(",

            "answer": "hey, i've been a type one since i was 2 years old, i am now 29 and still in better shape than most everyone i know. The lifestyle choices and lives we live make it harder for us to enjoy everyday life, but make us stronger and able to resist the little temptations a bit better. I tried when i turned 18 to join any and all of the services, and it was a no go, i tried once again at 23, and again at 27. They just don't want people that are health liabilities. No matter how healthy we keep ourselves, no matter how able-bodied we are, and no matter how strong we are. The truth of the matter is, they don't want the ones that could die at a moments notice.....strange huh. I always wanted to be a pilot, can't even do that in civilian life. I heard about a research project a year ago that had cured 14 out of 20 people with type 1 diabetics, i wrote to them and asked if i could be a guinea pig. I was turned down because i can still feel the symptoms when my bs gets down under 70. CRAP. Ever notice how there are all these research studies that target type 2, but not so many for the ones that really need it? If the military could just invest a little money into actually helping us, maybe there would be a far greater amount of recruits.",

            "answer": "What I guess I just don't get, Is why can't we even have a dang uniform, and work over sease on a base as a medic or something in the millitary, Or be in an office recruiting...I'm not excited by the civilian life for it is a way of making money and not serving my country. My dad was in the USAF for 10years, and both of my grandfathers were in the Army and I have 3 cousins in the Marines, It disapoints me to see the fact that so many people who ARE willing to serve OUR country cannot. I do see where the US is going with us not being able to join, But why can't we be medics or something on a green base if you not what I mean. I want to be in the marines, and that is my goal in life. I think I stand a good chance being the fact that they say they have discovered a cure and should have it out in the next 2 - 10 years. (I'm 13.) I'll be out of HS. I think I could wait a little bit to join the Marines if it meant thats what I'd have to do to be a marine. :-) But what gets me is it makes me sad that some people in their late 20's, Who want to be in the millitary wont ever get that great oportunity.....",

            "answer": "Hello all,I am 21 years old and am in the Air National Guard. I was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in November 09 one month before my ship date to basic. I have been fighting to stay in and am still going through this super long and frustrating process. The Air Force surprisingly is trying to work with me to let me stay in and my advice to all of you in the same situation is to fight for it. I have had to go before an officer for a medical review and they had me go and get an EKG test as well as an eye exam beforehand and bring the results to the review. Everything turned out alright with those tests and I am currently waiting to hear back as they are trying to get me through on a waiver. From what I've gathered from all this is that it really depends on what type of job you have and how badly the military needs people for those jobs. My job is a crew chief and it is a high demand job so from my understanding the military is willing to bend the rules to fit their needs. Unfortunately if you have type 1 before enlisting it's impossible to join any branch. Hopefully my situation works out but I'm not getting my hopes up. Good luck to all of you trying to serve our country with this disease!",
