            "answer": "Thanks for sharing!Yes PCOS is related to issues with insulin resistance problems. Because our bodies have more trouble breaking down food such as carbs and sugars, it causes us to gain more weight. Are you taking any medication right now? Metformin is generally given to us with PCOS. It's meant for diabetes, but for us who have PCOS it helps with our bodies and insulin.",

            "answer": "Since I've been diagnosed with PCOS, I switched to a low glycemic index diet, which is basically what you described. I am also on Metformin, which is supposed to help, and I run about 5-6 miles a day (well, I slowed down when I started my IVF cycle). I have not lost any weight since, but I was not overweight to begin with. However, I am about 10 lbs away from my desired weight and nothing I seem to be doing is making any difference :( I find it really frustrating that a person following such a strict diet and exercising so much cannot lose any weight! How is that physically possible lol :) Congrats on your success, though!",

            "answer": "I too have PCOS. I was on a low carb diet off and on for about 9 months in conjuction to taking metformmin regularly. I did achieve pregnancy; however, it was shortlived after I miscarried at 12 weeks and 3 days. Let me say, miscarrying is very hard to cope with. I will visit my doctor next week for a checkup and to see how soon my husband and I can start trying again after our miscarriage. I have started a low carb diet again, and I am currently taking metformin @750 mg 2x a day. I have not started exercising due to my recent miscarriage. However, after I'm cleared by my doctor, I plan to incorporate light to moderate exercise daily. I do believe these things will help me achieve pregnancy again, but my major concern is maintaining a healthy pregnancy. Any suggestions as how to maintain a healthy a healthy pregnancy with PCOS?",

            "answer": "Sorry for your loss. Xx congrats on your pregnancy. I have pcos and had a baby girl last July. Pcos is highly linked to gestational diabetes so if they don't test you for that sometime around 22weeks ask for the test. I was told since I have pcos is probably have it. And I did. I kept it diet controlled by eating no more than half q handful of wholegrain carbs per day.. lots of veg and protein ..and cutting out sugar. You should ask the doc or midwife for diet advice. I was reffered to a diabetic team and dietician. Will probably have it all again with this pregnancy. If you can't control it with diet alone they will pit you on metformin which is what I had for the last five weeks. Baby gained healthy weight and I didn't gain too much at all which they said was because id followed the diet so well. If diet and metformin still cant stop your blood sugars being high they give insulin. This is only if you DO have gestational diabetes but the diet should be followed.. too much sugar Wcan cause baby to gain too much weight.\u00a0\u00a0I had an ok pregnancy and my daughter is beautiful and amazing. Congrats .take it easy and try not to.stress just enjoy the pregnancy. If you have worries just talk to a health professional good luck xxx",

    "question": "I've been diagnosed with PCOS for over ten years. I tried birth control several times. I tried different medicines.I have been putting on 4-6 pounds a year since I was 18 (I'm 28). I got up to a size 16 and couldn't lose the weight no matter what I did. I had excessive hair growth everywhere. I carried almost all my weight in my stomach. I was depressed, had no energy, no libido. I would only get my period 3 times a year.One month ago, I eliminated simple sugars and non whole grain flours and carbs from my diet. I have lost over 10% of my body weight. My mood is more stable and at normal levels. My libido did a 180. My unwanted hair is coming in thinner.Discovering that polycystic ovarian syndrome may be insulin related has saved my body, my mind, and my relationship with my boyfriend.Thank you!",
