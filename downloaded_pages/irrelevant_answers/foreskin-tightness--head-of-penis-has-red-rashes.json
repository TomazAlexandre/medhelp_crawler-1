            "answer": "Hello,I cannot confirm anything without examination but it can be due to balanoposthitis. It may have any of multiple bacterial or fungal origins or be caused by contact dermatitides. Examination of the glans and the prepuce often reveals a red, moist macular lesion. KOH slide preparation and biopsy of the lesion are needed to confirm the diagnosis.One of the important causes is Diabetes mellitus. The use of the latex condoms can also lead to the same. Thus, will suggest you to get your blood sugar checked, maintain a good hygiene of the region by cleaning the sub-preputial area, rule out a fungal infection (candidiasis).It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Hi Bhupinder Kaur,I went to go see the urologist today. He did believe it was balanoposthitis but did a cotton swag test to find the cause of the balanoposthitis. The test results will be ready in 4 days. He tested for gonnoreah and clamidia STD wise and didn't mean herpes. He said its unlikely its an STD but just to test on the safe side. He prescribed me this cream: Hydrocortisone 1% CR + Clotrimazole CR EQ PTS Mixture. I was told to apply the cream 3 times a day. I've applied it twice so far. The foreskin pain is still there and hurts quite a bit and it doesn't look like the rash is getting any better but its only been applied twice I suppose. The burining sensation when I pee is still there but the pee is yellow and no blood. Also the discomfort caused when sleeping or walking is less than it was before.",

            "answer": "Hi,Just another quick update. I took a shower and washed the head and foreskin in warm water. It was painful pulling the foreskin back intially but after the water was applied, the tightness disappeared entirely. I applied the cream mentioned in the post above for the third time today as that is what the prescription states. I also pulled the foreskin back after the shower and there was no pain. I imagine this may only be temporary and tomorrow morning it may become tight again but it seems like a good sign. The rashes are still there but I guess the cream doesn't work wonders in one day. I am just relived to not be in pain at the moment.",

    "question": "I am in my early 20's and have never had sex. I have had protected oral sex and unprotected oral sex just once about 2 weeks ago. She did not appear to have any rashes or bumps on her lips. In the past 2-3 days, I have experienced tightness in my foreskin which causes pain when masturbating as well as the head of my penis has red rashes but no bumps. I visited a clinic today and they prescribed lamisil but also told me to come see an urologist next week. Has anyone come across this question before and know of the answers? I don't have a fever back pain or any of the other symptoms of herpes but am worried it might be genital herpes for some reason. I am debating on using the cream until I see the urologist but a doctor recommended it. His initial reaction was it seemed like I had unprotected sex which makes it seem like its bad but its red rashes and no bumps. If anyone can help me out that would be great.",
