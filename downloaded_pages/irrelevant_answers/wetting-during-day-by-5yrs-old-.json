            "answer": "It could be a sign of junior diabetes, but usually it occurs at night.\u00a0\u00a0I would get it checked out.Another issue could be that somehow the teacher had embarrassed her or maybe scolded her for not going to the bathroom when everyone else went, maybe she didn't have to go at the time, and the scolding has made her scared to ask.\u00a0\u00a0Or maybe she asked and was scolded and the teacher refused to let her go.\u00a0\u00a0Reason I say this is because it happened to me when I was in the 1st grade.\u00a0\u00a0I was a military brat living overseas and the teacher was a complete battleaxe.\u00a0\u00a0After I was scolded for not going to the rest room when everyone else went she denied me and I wet myself.\u00a0\u00a0I never did it again, but I remembered how mean she was.\u00a0\u00a0The point is check into everything and don't rule out something that may have happened in class.",

    "question": "My daughter was completely potty trained by the age of 2yrs.She has had only minor accidents with wetting in the earlylearning time. All was well, she stopped weeing in the night also byage of 4. Suddenly as she is approaching 5, she started wetting herpants in school for almost 2weeks and everyday. I checked for infection,its negative. I asked her several times but didn't get any answer, insteadstarted crying and she says she won't do it again and will go to toilet.But next day its the same story. I'm highly concerned. She is brightlittle girl, it is highly unexpected of her. Could it be medical or behavioural?",
