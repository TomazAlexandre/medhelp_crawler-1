            "answer": "Hi!While there is nothing much you can do to make the hair grow faster you can do a lot to improve the quality and quantity of hair. Head massage help and so does regular combing of hair. However, undue force should not be used. You could take iron and multivitamin pill. Keep the hair and scalp clean. Use mild shampoo. And, get a blood test done to see whether anemia, diabetes or hypothyroidism is the cause of hair fall. Also, rule out the possibility of dandruff as the cause. If you have dandruff (flakes of dead skin coming off the scalp) then please consult a skin specialist for proper treatment. Take care!",
