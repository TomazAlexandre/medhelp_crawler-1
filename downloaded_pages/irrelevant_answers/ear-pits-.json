            "answer": "It sounds like your daughter is doing great.\u00a0\u00a0Ear pits are one of the most common minor problems with the ear and affect 5-6 per 1000 births.\u00a0\u00a0Ear pits can occur as an isolated finding, as part of a genetic syndrome, or can be associated with renal problems.\u00a0\u00a0 Depending on any other findings, a renal ultrasound is sometimes pursued.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure about the types of prenatal testing that you have may had with your daughter, but a typical prenatal test such as an amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) provides information about the chromosomes of the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0This would not automatically rule out the various genetic syndromes that can be associated with ear pits.One study looked at the association of ear problems and whether or not to pursue renal ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0This research found that in patients with preauricular ear pits plus 1 or more of the following features should have a renal ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0The additional features include: other birth defects or dysmorphic features, family history of deafness, kidney or ear problems, or a maternal history of gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I hope that this information is helpful for you and your family.",
