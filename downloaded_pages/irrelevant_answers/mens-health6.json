            "answer": "Hi,Your husband needs to be seen by a neurologist.In 1998 I came down with numbness and loss of strenght in my fingers, hands, arms and legs. I used to work as a heavy duty mechanic and things got so bad that I could hardly function on the job. I could not longer start nuts or bolts or assemble items.I also experienced a lack of sensation in the groin area.After a referral from my doctor to a neurologist and after a nerve biopsy, I was diagnosed with a hereditary periheral neuropathy. Prior to that in 1996 they had diagnosed me with a neurogenic bladder.It is very possible that your husband has a disease of the nervous system. Simmilar to what I have. HNPP, Charcot Marie, Tooth syndrome, Diabetes and MS can be the cause.As of 2003 I had to end my career as a heavy duty mechanic and I have been on a permanent disability since. I have had more problems with numbness and loss of muscle strength, urological and gastro problems, as well as vision problems.In sincerely hope that this is not the case for your husband, but I feel that he needs to be seen by a neurologist. The sooner they can diagnose things, the better they can treat the symptoms.As for problems concerning the groin, I have been receiving injection treatment for ED since 2003. Currently I have an indwelling suprapubic catheter in for the last three years. Prior to that I used to self cath due to a neurogenic bladder.All the best.Ron",
