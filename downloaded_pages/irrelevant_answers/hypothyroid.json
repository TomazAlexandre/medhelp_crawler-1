            "answer": "Your thyroid results indicate that you could be somewhat hypo.\u00a0\u00a0Your lab is using an\u00a0\u00a0outdated reference range (as do most) for TSH, so using the range recommended by AACE nearly 10 yrs ago (0.3-3.0), your level would be quite near the top of the range.Your FT4 is very low and may be an indication that your FT3 will soon follow suit.\u00a0\u00a0The contrast between your FT3 and FT4 is not unusual.Yes, FT4 is converted to FT3, but your thyroid also produces some T3, which could account for your FT3 being as high as it is.\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors will start a thyroid patient on Synthroid or the generic, levothyroxine.\u00a0\u00a0You could ask your doctor for a trial dose, just to see if it helps your symptoms, which all indicate hypo.For the B12, are you taking oral supplements or shots?\u00a0\u00a0What were your actual B12 results?\u00a0\u00a0Some of us don't absorb B12 adequately (pernicious anemia), so oral supplements don't work well.You should also get checked for insulin resistance and PCOS, both of which can make weight loss difficult to impossible.",

            "answer": "Over conversion pattern comes to mind.\u00a0\u00a0Something to consider anyway.\"Pattern 4: Over ConversionPattern 4 is the opposite of pattern 3. The thyroid and pituitary are again working properly, but this time there is too much T4 converted to T3 (remember roughly 20% of T4 is converted into reverse T3 which is inactive and excreted). High levels of testosterone is the cause which also has the added effect of decreasing the amount of thyroid binding globulin (TBG: the taxi that carries the thyroid hormones).The high levels of T3 in conjunction with low TBG causes cells to become resistant to T3. They close the doors and do not allow anymore T3 into the cells. TSH levels will be normal even though the patient is showing signs of hypothyroidismThis pattern is similar to insulin resistance. In fact, patients with thyroid over conversion often also present with insulin resistance and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) which is also caused by increased testosterone levels. Managing blood sugar is extremely important. Since there is already to much T3, prescription thyroid medication will not help in this pattern.\"- Relief And Wellness Center - 6 Patterns Of Hypothyroidism.",

            "answer": "Insulin resistance and PCOS are 2 different conditions, but I'm not saying they are caused by high testosterone, though that seems to be what Red's article is saying.\u00a0\u00a0I have insulin resistance, but I do not have high testosterone levels, so I'd say that she's suggesting a mere \"possibility\".Thyroid, pancreas (produces insulin), reproductive system (testosterone and other reproductive hormones) are all part of the endocrine system and the hormones all work together (ideally.......).Explaining it in my own words....... Insulin resistance occurs when blood sugar levels are consistently high, which causes the pancreas to produce more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0If you continue to eat foods that are high in sugar, the pancreas continues to pump out more and more insulin and eventually, the body becomes resistant to it.\u00a0\u00a0It becomes a vicious cycle and the more simple carbohydrates you eat, the worse it gets and can/will lead to Type II diabetes.Insulin is often considered the \"fat storage hormone\", because whatever sugar you consume is shuttled, by insulin, into fat cells, if it's not used right away for energy.I'm not real \"up\" on PCOS, but it's caused by cysts on the ovaries.Both insulin and PCOS can cause weight gain and/or make it, seemingly, impossible to lose.\u00a0\u00a0Right now, I'm working on a very low glycemic diet, which is one with few simple carbs, that break down quickly.In my opinion, you don't have an over conversion issue; your thyroid is simply not working properly.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that the thyroid does produce some T3 could very be why your levels are still higher.Of course, it's always best to check out all possibilities.",

It simply may not have built up yet.\u00a0\u00a0Simply stated, glucose toxicity is when the body is exposed to chronically high blood glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0You don't have that.You could have a gluten intolerance so that whenever you eat breads and pasta it causes inflammation; or your feeling after eating bread/pasta could be an insulin resistance thing.\u00a0\u00a0Anything made with sugar and white flour (most processed foods) and even fruit are considered simple carbs, which are broken down in your body rather quickly, so you\u00a0\u00a0have all this sugar floating around.\u00a0\u00a0When this happens, your pancreas produces more insulin, since insulin is the hormone that \"escorts\" sugar to the cells of your body for energy.\u00a0\u00a0The cells become resistant and won't let the insulin in, which causes blood sugar to be elevated, because it's staying in the blood, not being utilized by the cells. Sugar not used, will eventually be shuttled to the fat cells for storage.\u00a0\u00a0It's a vicious cycle as you continue to eat more simple carbs.You might try switching to whole grain breads and pastas to see if it still\u00a0\u00a0makes you feel poorly.\u00a0\u00a0If it does, I'd suggest eliminating or at least, severely limiting your gluten intake.If you have a weight problem, a low glycemic diet is best, anyway.",

    "question": "Hello - new to the forum.\u00a0\u00a0Looking for input.\u00a0\u00a0I've struggled with fatigue most of my life with bouts so severe I was dragging and fighting to function.\u00a0\u00a0This past winter there were several things going on - major stress situation at work and in family, was anemic, and also had low D3 and low B12.\u00a0\u00a0I'm 44 and weigh 220 and have a difficult time losing it.\u00a0\u00a0Additionally, I had three full cycles between Jan 1 and Feb 28 and 5 days to a week of spotting before the real cycle begins.\u00a0\u00a0 During this time when my lab results showed the above, I was the most fatigued I ever was.\u00a0\u00a0I was working full time and could barely get there.\u00a0\u00a0Doing anything was such a chore.\u00a0\u00a0I was severely achy and foggy as well.\u00a0\u00a0I literally had to sit at work for moments at a time when my brain just wouldn't work.The doctor took those labs and had me to start on iron supplements and B12.\u00a0\u00a0I saw on the results my D3 was 29 which was under so I started that as well along with lots of Vitamin C since it helps with iron and B12 absorption.\u00a0\u00a0Three months have passed and I'm 60 % better but still more tired than I should be, wanting to sleep ten-twelve hours a night, hair still all over the place - especially bathroom sink and floor.\u00a0\u00a0Nails aren't as brittle and peeling but they still have ridges.\u00a0\u00a0Feet still always cold very easily.\u00a0\u00a0I can't stand it sometimes but not as bad as 3 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0My mind still feels a bit overwhelmed at times but nowhere near as bad.Also, I put myself on natural progesterone cream to hopefully temper the heavy bleeding.\u00a0\u00a0It has helped about 20%.Now for the thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Back in February the doc said my thyroid was normal but now, with still feeling a bit off, I'm looking at what is said here on hypothyroid and am beginning to wonder.\u00a0\u00a0So, here were my Feb thyroid lab results:T4 FREE CALCULATED -\u00a0\u00a01.83\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(1.43-3.8)TSH -\u00a0\u00a0 2.79\u00a0\u00a0 (.40-4.50)T4 FREE\u00a0\u00a0-\u00a0\u00a0 .9\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(.8-1.8)T3 FREE -\u00a0\u00a0 3.2\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(2.3-4.2 pg/ml)Thyroid Peroxidase AB\u00a0\u00a0 14 iu/ml\u00a0\u00a0(<35)If anyone has any thoughts, I would appreciate it.\u00a0\u00a0And if levels are off, would synthroid work or is there something better for my type of results?\u00a0\u00a0I have been looking at other people's labs and see that I have such a contrast between my FT3 and FT4.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a little under the ideal for FT3 while bottomed out for the Ft4.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't found any other results with such a peculiar contrast and wonder how this can possibly be.\u00a0\u00a0I mean, isn't it the T4 that becomes T3?\u00a0\u00a0If yes, where did my T3 come from since my T4 is so low???Thanks,Paula",
