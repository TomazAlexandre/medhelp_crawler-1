            "answer": "Hey Sue, sorry I missed your post!I believe it is Thyroglobulin levels you would need to be concerned about.Thyroglobulin levels is a useful ancillary marker of disease/cancer activity and provides information about the state and extent of residual functioning thyroid tissue in patients both on and offL-thyroxine suppression or after stimulation with recombinant TSH. Ideally, the thyroglobulin levels will be low or undetectable after treatment, usually surgery followed by radioactive iodine.Congratulations to your daughter in running XO Jr Olympics Regional's, that is a great feat.",

            "answer": "So if my thyroglobulin antibody is less then <20 (normal is 0-40), is that a different marker completly than thyroid perodxidase which is at 109 (normal is 0-35)",

            "answer": "Hey again.I don't quite understand your concern, that is, is it autoimmune or cancer concern. So this best answer I have for now.Cancer:Serum TgAb testing is primarily used as an adjunct test when serum Tg measurements are requested. First, sensitive and specific TgAb screening of sera in these cancer patients is necessary, because even low antibody concentrations can interfere with the Tg measurements made by most Tg methods . serial TgAb measurements themselves may serve as a surrgogate tumor marker test for TgAb-positive patients in whom Tg testing may be unreliable. patients who have persistent disease after treatment retain detectable TgAb concentrations. In fact, a rise in the TgAb level is often the first indication of recurrence in such patients.Autoimmune:Thyroglobulin antibodies (Tg Abs) and Thyroid peroxidase\u00a0\u00a0are present inGrave's disease, Hashimoto's thyroiditis, idiopathic thyroid atrophy, De Quervain's thyroiditis - transiently, and\u00a0\u00a0certain percentage of people without thyroid disease. Thyroglobulin may occur in organ-specific autoimmune diseases, including pernicious anemia, Addison's disease, type I diabetes mellitus , polyglandular endocrine failure syndromes etc. Sj\u00f6gren syndrome, lupus, rheumatoid arthritis, and pernicious anemia are sometimes positive. As well as in the normal population without thyroid disorders. Therefore, thyroid levels are the prevailing diagnose.I hope this helps with your concern/question.",

    "question": "i have thyroid cancer with thyroid removed 1 year ago.\u00a0\u00a0i have blood work every 3 months and am currently on .88 snythroid.\u00a0\u00a0Current blood work came back\u00a0\u00a0T3 2.4, T4 1.3,, TSH 5.14, Anti Thyroid Antibodies <20, however thryoid perodidase is 109 which is high.\u00a0\u00a0Just had ultersound with a few lymph nodes showed up and did rai for body scan tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0How bad is that high number and does that mean the cancer is back and has spread.\u00a0\u00a0I cant seem to get a good answer.\u00a0\u00a0I did not have any lymph nodes removed last year as they were clean.\u00a0\u00a0I had rai of 143 last year also",
