            "answer": "Will Simvastatin and Rosiglitazone lower HBsAg or also HBV DNA?yes but we don t have data available about this, but the best drugs active on hbvdna are tnf and etv while they have no effect on hbsag so i'd cpnsider comboIs there any situation where HBsAg eliminated while HBV DNA continue to exist?yes very rare hbsag mutants made by LAM or ADV and very rare cases of occult hbvwhen hbsag is cleared hbv cannot suppress immune system anymore so there is total control of hbv and virus cannot make infection anymore.cronic hbv is due to hbsag suppression on mmune systemHave they tried these medicines in humans yet?sim is the most used drig for cholesterol from decades and now is generic from years, one of the ost used drugs in the worldRosiglitazonelow diabetes drug used by million of people but less than sim since diabetes is less common than high cholesterol",

    "question": "Rosiglitazone, an old diabetes drug is active on hbsag lowering and synergistic with nucs and interferon.these are the drugs to study not stupid nucs that acts on hbvdna only making mutations.on the contrary studies on these cheap and generic durgs are not funded by drug makers, on the contrary we see stupid doctors without trials or studies saying now that these drugs can make liver damage while it is the opposite. only less than 1% has effects on liver and my question is how many drugs have less than 1% effect on liver..........almost no drugs since liver is impilicated in all drugs metabolismRosiglitazone and simvastatin are active on lipids needed by hbv to produce high amounts of antigens, the theory is of course that if lipids are low antigen production gets lowIn conclusion, this study showed that rosiglitazone inhibited the replication of HBV in vitro, and suggested that the combination therapy of rosiglitazone and nucleot(s)ide analogues or interferon could be a therapeutic option for chronic HBV infection.http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&_udi=B6WBK-4YY8MWC-3&_user=10&_coverDate=05%2F28%2F2010&_rdoc=1&_fmt=high&_orig=search&_sort=d&_docanchor=&view=c&_searchStrId=1422146788&_rerunOrigin=google&_acct=C000050221&_version=1&_urlVersion=0&_userid=10&md5=9c14ef3d8c21eef65a5250af260ee840",
