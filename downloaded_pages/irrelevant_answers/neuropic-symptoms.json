            "answer": "I'm afraid I've never heard of \"neuropic\" symptoms before.Did you, perhaps, mean \"neuropathic?\"I'll pass on a small amount of information about neuropathic pain and symptoms just in case that is what you meant. If it's not, please accept my apology and I'll do some research!If you DID mean neuropathy symptoms, I suggest you see a neurologist for evaluation. And that list below of possible causes for this pain........PLEASE know that there are numerous other reasons, many of them simple and benign, for this type of pain & numbness.PeaceGreenlydiaNeuropathic pain is a complex, chronic pain state that usually is accompanied by tissue injury. With neuropathic pain, the nerve fibers themselves may be damaged, dysfunctional or injured. These damaged nerve fibers send incorrect signals to other pain centers. The impact of nerve fiber injury includes a change in nerve function both at the site of injury and areas around the injury.One example of neuropathic pain is called phantom limb syndrome. This occurs when an arm or a leg has been removed because of illness or injury, but the brain still gets pain messages from the nerves that originally carried impulses from the missing limb. These nerves now misfire and cause pain.What causes neuropathic pain?Neuropathic pain often seems to have no obvious cause; but, some common causes of neuropathic pain include:AlcoholismAmputationBack, leg, and hip problemsChemotherapyDiabetesFacial nerve problemsHIV infection or AIDSMultiple sclerosisShinglesSpine surgeryWhat are the symptoms of neuropathic pain?Symptoms may include:Shooting and burning painTingling and numbness",

            "answer": "Thanks Greenlydia!\u00a0\u00a0Yes sorry, Neuropic, meaning symptoms of neuropathy. I do have an appointment with a neurologist.\u00a0\u00a0My primary care doctor says it is my anxiety and not to worry. But he says that about everything.Martin428- yes that is exactly how I feel. This is my 2nd bout with anxiety so I am slightly less worried than the first time when it was very hard to be convinced anxiety is causing all this.\u00a0\u00a0I did just start taking anxiety medication and that helped last time after about 3 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I'm hoping that stops the nighttime tingling too!!\u00a0\u00a0If it does, that is pretty good evidence that anxiety is the culprit.",

    "question": "Hello everyone.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen some posts about this but wanted to start fresh.\u00a0\u00a0I've had health anxiety for about 3 years and have had good spells and bad (but not too bad).\u00a0\u00a0A few months ago my hands, fingers, and some toes started to \"fall asleep\" easily at night and now I notice my head and face have started tingling at night as well.\u00a0\u00a0Every night is a little different, last night was the worst so far for about half the night anyhow.\u00a0\u00a0There definitely seems to be link with how anxious I am and how bad the nighttime spells are.\u00a0\u00a0During the day my hands have started to feel tighter and occasionally I have some buzzing in a foot or hand.\u00a0\u00a0Only medication I was taking was a statin for cholesterol but stopped that 5 weeks ago thinking it could be the problem.\u00a0\u00a0I just had a blood test to show my vitamin B level is fine and I don't have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0While these nightime spells are certainly tolerable, when they affect my head (and it does cause a mild headache), it really freaks me out and makes the anxiety worse thus aggrevating the viscious circle we all know.\u00a0\u00a0So, I ask, has anyone else experienced these neuropic conditions and what has happened?\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks!",
