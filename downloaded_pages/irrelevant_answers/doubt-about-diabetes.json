            "answer": "Yes, there is a difference. The glucose meter measures blood sugar at that exact moment. The A1C, on the other hand, gives an average of blood sugars for about 2-3 months period. The A1C therefore, gives a lot more significant information but it can also be misleading. For example of someone has a lot of highs, but also a lot of lows, it might average out and look like the person is maintaining a good blood glucose level when they are, in fact, swinging wildly.Yes, the A1C is officially now the measure for diagnosis of pre-diabetes and diabetes. A1C's below 5.7 are considered normal. 5.7 to 6.4 are pre-diabetic and anything over 6.5 is considered diabetes. Some physicians though are still using fasting blood sugars to diagnose with below 100 normal, 100-125 pre-diabetic and 126 and over diabetic.It is hard to answer the question of which kind of diabetes is more likely to result in cardiac issues and you could probably google it and get some actual stats. But off the top of my head I would say Type 2 is more likely to cause cardiac problems than Type 1. The reason for this is that Type 2's are often (but not always) overweight which is a serious risk factor, and also have a cluster of other problems such as high blood pressure and high cholesterol which are risk problems for heart problems as well.",

            "answer": "There is a diference both in the hbA1c and the readings on the glucose meters depending upon the hematcrit, or the number of erythrocytes per unit volume. The meters are calibrated to a specific number of cells per unit volume, which is a compromise between the readings of the male and the female.Males have a hematcrit of around 46 and females, because of menstrual bleeding, often end up between 36 and 38.Thus female tend to have slightly higher glucose readings than they actually have and men may have a slightly lower reading. The literature suggests that runs about four-five points.It makes sense to know your hematocrit. For someone with hemorhoids, for example, the hematcrit may drop down into the twenties, and the readings on the meter will not be accurate.I would concur with Zoelula that type 2 is more likely to cause cardiac problems in the short run. In the long run, uncontrolled diabetes is dangerous no matter what kind it is.",

    "question": "I want to know whether there is a difference in readings on a glucose monitoring device and the results obtained on HbA1c test . If there is a difference what do they each measure and what is their significance?What is the usual test done to determine diabetes as i recently read that the HbA1c test is being used as a diagnostics tool..I also wanted to which kind of diabetes is more likely to result in cardiac issues for the patients....m just curious , so plzz help ,and m getting really confused......",
