            "answer": "Hi and sorry you have this problem. So you have bad itching?\u00a0\u00a0It could be scabies or maybe you got lice from this girl. Do you see any rash on the body or little tracks or burroghs? Get a magnifying glass and see if you see any tiny bugs or anything in the pubic hair on your body or head hair.mkh9",

            "answer": "frank855.I also read that for diabetic people:Localized itching is often caused by diabetes. It can be caused by a yeast infection, dry skin, or poor circulation. When poor circulation is the cause of itching, the itchiest areas may be the lower parts of the legs.So, it could be a number of things but apparently diabetes can cause itching due to various reasons too. Have you been tested for diabetes? If not you should and see\u00a0\u00a0a doctor about the itching too.mkh9",

            "answer": "So did you only get tested for Gonorrhea, and\u00a0\u00a0Chlamydia? If so then you should also get tested for Syphillis, Trichomonas, HIV, Hepatitis B and C. The Trichomonas you can get tested any time the other test you should wait a month to 6 weeks to develop antibody. You might want to get retested in a couple of weeks for the gonorrhea and chlamydia to make sure the treatment worked for the gonorrhea since there are so many resistant strains out there and for Chlamydia because it usually takes several weeks to grow. This way you can be sure you are clear.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, it had nothing to do with the question about rash and itching. I just wanted to be sure you got treated right. Then for the HIV testing if you want to pursue that usually after initial testing you retest at 3 , and 6 months. 3 months is really pretty final but if you may have diabetes I would do the 6 month too.\u00a0\u00a0I know this all stressful but you will through it all.mkh9",

            "answer": "Well, you probably don't have anything, I was just trying to tell you that maybe it would helpful to clear you mind if you wanted to get tested so you would see you are negative. Maybe that would make you feel better? It is very unlikely you have anything. Especially, since this person said they had nothing. Things will be Ok. Try to calm down and realize that. Since you are so down about this maybe you should talk to a friend or counselor? Someone to help you through this. Of course we are here to help you too. Stress can cause a lot of symptoms including stomach pain. So, I think that is what is going on. For the rash or itching you could have a doctor get a skin scraping to see if they can see any thing. Also, get tested for diabetes. Do a fasting blood sugar. I'm sure you will be all right.mkh9",
