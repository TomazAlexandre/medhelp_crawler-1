    "question": "I an 24 weeks and 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0I failed my first glucose test and now i did the three hire one and Dr just called and said i failed it too. Now I'm having to go to get my blood drawn twice a week and they put me on a diet where i can barely eat anything. Is there anyone else that is going through this or had it I the past? If so how long did you have to get the twice a week blood draws and did diet alone help or did they give you pills or insulin shots. also does anyone have any good ideas for meals? Thanks",
