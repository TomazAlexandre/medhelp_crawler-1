            "answer": "I drink occasionally, no drugs, and not any type of vegetarian. Side note on the drinking, even when I do drink, I usually only have one or two drinks. I always get sick to my stomach before I even get tipsy, I don't mix well with alcohol. And with the drugs, I used to smoke marijuana (quit about two years ago) and as a teenager I tried LSD twice.",

            "answer": "Hi Crystal,How are you? Fatigue may be due to a lot of conditions such as anemia, allergy, sleep disorders, thyroid problems, certain medications, underlying medical conditions such as Addison's disease, autoimmune conditions, infection, diabetes or heart/kidney or liver problems. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition that starts with flu-like symptoms and lasts for 6 months.\u00a0\u00a0However, most people with CFS do not get much relief from rest. Have this evaluated further by your doctor for proper management. Take care and do keep us posted.",

    "question": "Hello,I am 26 years old (smoker) I recently saw my doc for extreme fatigue. She ran blood work and I showed a slight B12 deficiency (235 pg/mL). My TIBC came back great (mid range). I have always been slightly microcytotic, she thinks I have the thalesemia (spelling?) trait because my iron levels are great and I don't have cancer. My folate was great (17.4 ng/mL), ANA screen negative, the antibody test for pernicious anemia was also negative. RBC, hematocrit, hemoglobin all normal. The only other thing abnormal was the MCH (24.8) and my MCV was borderline (78), but again says this has to do with the thalesemia trait. Any ideas on what could be the cause for this B12 deficiency?Besides the extreme fatigue, I do have a few neurological symptoms, I have nerve pain off and on down my legs and sometimes down my arms. I have a weird pain behind my left eye sometimes (only when I look sharply to the side), not sure if this is related. I also have dizzy spells with slight disorientation.Any ideas or questions to ask my doc that would be useful are greatly appreciated, I have been dealing with the fatigue for a while now, but is starting to have an impact on my life.Thanks for your time,Crystal",
