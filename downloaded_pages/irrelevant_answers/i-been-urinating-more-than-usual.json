            "answer": "Hello,Without examination confirmation of a diagnosis is tough but urge of frequent urination can be due to diabetes mellitus. Other possibilities are glomerulonephritis, pyelonephritis (inflammation of the kidneys),urinary tract infection, hypercalcemia hypokalemia(low potassium),hyperthyroidism, hyperparathyroidism, diuretic drugs and benign hyperplasia of the prostate(in males).In my opinion, investigations like kidney functions, blood sugar levels, ultrasound lower abdomen, intravenous pyelography , prostate specific antigen blood test, thyroid function tests and cystoscopy may be needed to confirm a diagnosis. I sincerely advise you to consult a urologist or nephrologist and get yourself evaluated so that a confirmatory diagnosis can be made.Hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
