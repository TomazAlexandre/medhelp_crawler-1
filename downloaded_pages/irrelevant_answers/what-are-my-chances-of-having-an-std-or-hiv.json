            "answer": "Canker sores is not a sign of STD. I get them and I don't have any STDs (except for Hepatitis B - but I got that from childhood).The flesh colored bumps could be HPV, but also could have been there all along and you never noticed them.Any sexual intercourse without protection carries some risk for STDs, despite what the other partner said about his/her sexual history, testing history, and despite what you perceive about their likelihood of having something. The partner may have something and not even know it.To answer your question, your chances of having an STD is pretty low, but not zero due to the unprotected sex. So far, you haven't said anything to indicate you have any STD. If you want to sure, you can get tested when you see your doctor. Just be straightforward with your questions and concerns with your doctor. He/she is not there to judge you but to make you physically healthy.",

            "answer": "I've only had 1 sexual partner and it was this guy. I've never been tested for any STD's because before him I was a virgin. They start testing at age 21 and my doctor asked me if I was sexually active and I said no. I didn't say I had been years ago because I'm embarrassed to admit it.",

    "question": "In 2011/2012 I had sex for the first time. It was unprotected. The guy didn't ejaculate inside me or my mouth but there was pre-ejaculate present. I dated him off and on in those two years. When we broke up he wasn't with anyone else in between. And before we had sex I asked him if he was clean and he said yes that he gets checked every year. I am on birth control and I've never had a paps. I'm too scared and embarrassed to mention I had sex. It was a huge mistake and now it bothers me. He was my only sex partner. Over the years after I had sex I noticed I started getting canker sores more often. I had them as a child but now I get them every few months or when I eat too many things with acid. I've also noticed I have a few bumps on the inside of my vagina. They're flesh colored and small. I don't know if they were there before I had sex. I know I'll have to go to the doctor soon but I'm trying to prepare for that day as I know I'll hurt many people by my poor decisions. If anyone can help me please that would be good. I'm 21 also and have had type 1 diabetes for 14 years. Thanks.",
