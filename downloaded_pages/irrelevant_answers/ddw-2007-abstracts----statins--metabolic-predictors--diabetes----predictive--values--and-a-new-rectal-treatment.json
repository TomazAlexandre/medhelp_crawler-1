            "answer": "Background: Previous epidemiologic studies using the NHANES database have revealed a higher than expected prevalence of DM in patients infected with HCV. It has been hypothesized that insulin resistance may be the etiologic link although a precise cause and effect relationship remains unclear. This study's aim was to clarify the relationship between HCV and diabetes using the most recent iteration of the NHANES survey (2003-2004).Methods: Demographic, physical exam, and laboratory data from the 2003-04 NHANES survey were combined into a single database using SPSS v.14.0. HCV status was determined using an ELISA, confirmed by RIBA. DM status was classified based on the subject's self-reported medical history. Cases coded as missing or indeterminate for either disorder were censored.Results: The final database included 7,283 persons; 87 (1.2%) had HCV and 486 (6.7%) were diagnosed with DM. Mean age was 35.7",

Haruna1; A. Inoue11. Dept. of Gastroenterology and Hepatology, Osaka Prefectural Medical Center, Osaka, Japan.(Aim) It was suggested that rectally administered interferon (IFN) is transferred into the lymphatic system via rectal mucous membrane in animal study. We reported that administration of low dose IFN suppository could suppress hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication in patients with chronic hepatitis C. In this study, we focused on examining the long-term biological effects after the therapy. (Methods) Fourteen patients with chronic hepatitis C participated in the study. The IFN suppository, which was made in the Department of Pharmacy of Osaka Prefectural Medical Center, contained 1000 units of lymphoblastoid IFN alpha. The patients had administration of one IFN suppository daily for 24 weeks. Serum HCV viral loads, liver function and blood cell count were tested every 4 weeks during the treatment and until 72 weeks after the end of the treatment. The CD4/CD8 ratio and 2",

            "answer": "easibility of induction by twice-daily administration of interferon-beta prior to the standard combination therapy using pegylated interferon-alpha-2b plus ribavirinT. Nakatani 1; Y. Akashi1; H. Matsuo1; S. Takeyama1; M. Uejima1; Y. Yamane1; K. Hashimoto1; E. Kikuchi11. Gastroenterology, Nara Prefectural Nara Hospital, Nara, Nara, Japan.Aims: It has been reported that longer treatment with combination therapy using pegylated interferon (IFN)-alpha-2b plus ribavirin (RIB) for patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) leads to more effective viral eradication. However, in Japan where treatment period is limited, the achievement of early viral clearance should be necessary. We already confirmed the effectiveness of high dose IFN-alpha-2b induction in combination with RIB when the treatment period was limited to 24 weeks. In this study, it is evaluated whether IFN induction is also effective in the 48-week combination therapy using pegylated IFN-alpha-2b plus RIB.Methods: Forty patients chronically infected with genotype 1b HCV were divided into 2 groups. Thirty-two patients underwent standard 48-week combination therapy using 1.5",

            "answer": "Retrospective Analysis of the Effect of Taking a Statin Along with Peginterferon and Ribavirin (PI+R) on SVR.T. Bader1; M. Madhoun1; S. Rizvi11. VA Medical Center, University of Oklahoma, Oklahoma City, OK, USA.Methods: 104 patients taking PI+R were compared to 30 patients who by chance took triple therapy [(PI+R) plus a statin]. A modified intent to treat approach was taken whereby if any patient had a least one data point after starting therapy, he or she was included in the denominator.Virtually all patients taking a statin were on simvastatin (n=25); 2 were on lovastatin, 2 on atorvastatin and 1 on fluvastatin.The pooled SVR rate* for the 104 patients on standard treatment was 37%. This is the highest SVR ever reported in the medical literature for a VA based population.The pooled SVR rate for the triple therapy group was 63%. In terms of HCV subgroups, the effect was statistically strongest for genotype one, the most difficult subgroup to treat.Conclusion: Statins appear to be associated with a higher SVR rate of standard PI+R therapy. This observation principally occurs on the basis of a medium powered statin (simvastatin) in terms of the Ikeda experiment (Hepatology 2006;44:117-125). The only patient to take fluvastatin during the study was cured. Statins need to be studied prospectively for their effect on hepatitis C and the outcome of treatment.SVR RateNo Statin(%) \tp value(chi-square) \tStatin(%)Genotype 1 \t16/65 (25) \t.014 \t11/20(55)Genotype2 \t20/26(77) \t.43 \t3/5(60)Genotype3 \t7/15(47) \t.035 \t5/5(100)PooledAnalysis* \t37% \t.009 \t63%*Pooled analysis makes the population proportion 70% genotype 1 and 30% non-genotype 1 in order to mimic the proportion of genotypes in the USA.

            "answer": "METABOLIC SYNDROME IS A STRONG PREDICTOR OF TREATMENT FAILURE IN PATIENTS WITH CHRONIC HEPATITIS CI. Hanouneh1; A. E. Feldstein1; R. Lopez1; K. B. Cesario1; A. A. Pillai1; C. O. Zein2; N. N. Zein11. Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Cleveland Clinic Foundation, Cleveland, OH, USA.2. Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Case Western Reserve University, Louis Stokes VAMC, Cleveland, OH, USA.Background: The metabolic syndrome (MS) is a unique pathophysiologic condition whose underlying mechanism is related to insulin resistance. In HCV patients undergoing therapy with Peg IFN/RBV, insulin resistance has been linked to treatment failure.Our Aims were to estimate the prevalence of MS in HCV patients undergoing anti-viral therapy and to assess its predictive value in treatment outcome.Methods: All HCV patients that were treated with Peg IFN/RBV between 2002 and 2004 and had clinical data to assess for MS were identified (n=251). MS was defined using the ATP III criteria. Descriptive statistics were computed for all factors. Univariate analysis was performed to compare variables of interest. A logistic regression analysis was performed to study multivariable associations. The final model contained gender, ethnicity, genotype, metabolic syndrome, fibrosis, and steatosis stage.Results: MS was present in 71/251 (28%) patients. MS was less common in Caucasian patients compared to non-Caucasian patients [49/193 (25%) vs 22/58 (38%), p=0.063]. Overall SVR was achieved in 121/251 (48%) patients. Genotype 1 (p<0.001), non-Caucasian ethnicity (p<0.001), male gender (p=0.04), higher fibrosis stage (p=0.02), higher BMI (p=0.003), and MS (p<0.001) were significantly associated with lack of SVR. The table presents the results of the multivariable logistic regression analysis. Adjusting for ethnicity, genotype, gender, fibrosis, and steatosis stage, subjects with MS are 2.8 times (95% CI: 1.5, 5.6) more likely to fail treatment than those without MS. Conclusion: MS is frequently seen in patients with chronic HCV and is an independent predictor of lack of response to antiviral therapy. If confirmed, MS could easily be incorporated in clinical practice to identify those who are most likely to benefit from antiviral therapy in the setting of HCV infection.Factor (Reference) \tOR (95% CI) \tP valueGenotype (1 vs. Other) \t5.2 (2.5, 10.6)\t<0.0001Ethnicity (Other vs. Caucasian) \t4.5 (2.0, 9.8)\t0.0002Metabolic Syndrome \t2.8 (1.5, 5.6)\t0.002Fibrosis (1 stage increase) \t1.4 (1.1, 1.7)\t0.003Gender (Male vs. Female) \t1.6 (0.89, 2.9)\t0.11Steatosis (1 stage increase) \t0.63 (0.39, 1.1)\t0.08",
