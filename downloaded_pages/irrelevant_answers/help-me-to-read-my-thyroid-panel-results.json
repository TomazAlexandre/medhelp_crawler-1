            "answer": "Thyroid meds don't lower antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0Most likely what's happening is that your thyroid is functionally dead, so the antibodies are going into remission.\u00a0\u00a0You had a very high antibody count five years ago.\u00a0\u00a0The antibodies have done their job and destroyed your thyroid.If you're just feeling a little hyper, you might want to reduce your meds a little, but I think cutting them in half is too drastic.You still haven't given me the reference ranges for any of your tests, but TT3 and TT4 in your original post both look on the low (hypo) side to me.\u00a0\u00a0Is your doctor wanting to lower your meds based on symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0What is his rationale for such a huge reduction?",

            "answer": "I think 90 is a more reasonable dose; you could even try 105.It is hard to find a good thyroid doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Look at the advances that have been made in diabetes testing and treatment while virtually nothing has changed for thyroid in 50 years.My endo and I both think my thyroid is dead; and that was pretty much confirmed by my last ultrasound since my thyroid is now atrophied.\u00a0\u00a0I take 88 mcg of T4.\u00a0\u00a0120 mg of Armour is roughly equivalent to 146 mcg of T4, so it's possible that's a full replacement dose for you.",
