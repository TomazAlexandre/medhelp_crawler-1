            "answer": "I am not a doctor, but the numbness and tingling can be a sign of Raynaud's.\u00a0\u00a0Do a google search on Raynaud's and see if that makes any sense.\u00a0\u00a0As for the facial and neck sweating, any chance it is hormone related?\u00a0\u00a0Hot flashes are common in premenopausal and menopausal women and they can occur just as you have described.\u00a0\u00a0You can become very warm, red in the face, neck and/or chest, and sweat. The episodes can come on suddenly.Because you have a history of HTN and CHF, I think it would be a good idea to touch base with your family doctor or cardio.Take Careconnie",

            "answer": "Hi Colleen,Aside from perimenstrual symptoms, increased sweating, hand tremor\u00a0\u00a0and clammy skin can be attributed to hyperthyroidism. There is also increased heart rate and the systolic blood pressure ( or the first number in a blood pressure reading) may be high.How long have you been experiencing this? Are there other symptoms present? What blood tests were done? It would be helpful to have your thyroid hormones\u00a0\u00a0(serum TSH,\u00a0\u00a0T3 and T4) as well as your sugar levels checked to eliminate diabetes as a cause of the nerve problems in your finger and toes.Take care and keep us posted.",

    "question": "I'm a 45 year old female just diagnosed with severe hypertension and congestive heart failure. Since starting the medications and changing some of my lifestyle I'm noticing improvement. I do however have a couple of symptoms that I'm not sure are related and thought someone here could help me. I tend to start sweating suddenly, mostly around my face, chest, neck etc., it is uncontrollable, unpredictable and excessive. The other symptom is just as bizarre-I sometimes experience numbness and tingling in the tips of my fingers and toes. I noticed today when this occurred that my fingertips were extremely pale in comparison to the rest of my hand. This is just as unpredictable as the sweating.Any wisdom for me, or are these signs completely unrelated? Thanks so much for any help!colleen",
