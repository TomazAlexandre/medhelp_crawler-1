Other ladies I have talked to also have the same experience. I guess everything just goes haywire during this time!",

            "answer": "all this is a very old post...menopause causes bones to weaken which happens with age also. worse if you smoke, advice...see a neurologist....Id think it more neurological , everthing is connected , if neuro has no answers and likely he/she will...simple test like ekg just on different spots of body to check neuro function.then see osteopath.vgirl....any issues ever with anxiety/panic attacks?all sometimes sciatic nerve is knicked during surgery of hyster or any other surger to Dx femal problems...sciatica develops...again a neurological issue.good luck....Ok wasnt gonna get into this but must tell you 3 years or so after my hyster,,and it doesnt matter if you had one or not...my symptoms numbness bubbly, tinggly in fingers over timeprogressed up to elbows,,,,finally after tons of Dr trips I found a neurologist by chance who was doing a shift at a urgent care clininc...he gave exam of feet arms and he nailed the Dx..degenerative bone disease..refered me to neurological surgeon.....I was close to becoming a paraplegic...my nerves was trapped between intervertable spaces, getting compressed..Once they are dead nerves are dead you dont get them back.I had a diskemctomy of neck, they found three vertebrae fused had to drill them apart and insert donor bone,. I am fine now its been a year,,,full recovery is considered 2 years only permenant issue is I can never work with hands above head ( like paint a ceiling)I have to watch what I lift but it progresses to more ane more .I just want you to know I am telling you this from first hand knowledge...dont wait for primary care they will tell you arthritis, all types of stuff...go to top dog a neurologist.He will refer you if surgery is needed.hugs and please take me seriousCherie",
