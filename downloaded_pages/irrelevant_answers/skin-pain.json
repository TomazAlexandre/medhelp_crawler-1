            "answer": "Hi Mikey,Welcome to MedHelp's Pain Management Forum. I am glad you found us and took the time to post. Can you share with us any additional information?Often skin sensitivity as you describe is related to RSD a sympathetic nervous system condition. Actually RSD (Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy) is an old term and the new medical term is CRPS (Complex Regional Pain Syndrome.) I cannot diagnosis you nor can Momsterjam, or anyone on this forum. We can offer you information and suggestions.RSD or CRPS exhibits the type of pain and sensitivity you've stated. Characteristic signs and symptoms of sympathetic nervous system involvement include the following:Burning pain, Extreme sensitivity to touch, Skin color changes (red or bluish) and Skin temperature changes (hot or cold).There are treatments which include medications. A good neurologist may be beneficial. I encourage you to consult your PCP and begin the diagnostic process. Please let us know how you are doing. We'll look forward to your updates.Take Care,~Tuck",
