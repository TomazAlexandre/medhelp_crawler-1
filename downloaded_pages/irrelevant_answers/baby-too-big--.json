            "answer": "Yes they told me I was measuring 39 cm when I should have been measuring 34 cm. And my son was already 5 pounds 9 oz at 32 weeks...so he could be a 9 pound baby or more. I found out in week 31 I had gestational diabetes but I have had no problem controlling sugars with just diet and I do slip up once in awhile for a craving. I do not know what to expect as far as his size goes...it scares me.",

            "answer": "My advice would be to wait it out. My doctor was \"moderately concerned\" pertaining to the size of my baby's abdomen around the same time, but has since changed his mind. Time changes things (obviously) and there may be no cause to worry at all. So don't stress.",

    "question": "I went for my 30 week checkup today & my doctor didn't say she was concerned.. Only that my baby is quite big at 30 weeks. She is sending me for an ultrasound between my 32-34 th week of pregnancy. On the paper, she wrote something concerning measurements but being a doctor, her penmanship isn't so hot lol! I'm a little concerned as to what this could mean for baby & I.Anyone have a similar experience they are willing to share? Any advice, kind words would be greatly appreciated! :)",
