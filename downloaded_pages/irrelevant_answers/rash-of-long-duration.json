            "answer": "Your rash has none of the characteristics of herpes.\u00a0\u00a0The distribution (groin and perianal) suggests irritation or psoriasis rather than yeast or fungus.\u00a0\u00a0In my experience, once you get rid of the inflammation (in your case with one or both of the costisones--betamethosone and desonide--rather than the antifungals--clotrimazole and Loprox, the best thing to do is stop everything and just use a bland moisturizer, if that.I don't know what to make of the Western blot test, and cannot undertsand why it was done.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think the canker sores are related to anything, nor is the irritation at the corners of the mouth relevant.Time to stop worrying.Best.Dr. Rockoff",

    "question": "About 7 weeks ago, I started getting a rash in the crevices of my groin, at the same time I was getting what appeared to be canker sores in my mouth.\u00a0\u00a0Like everyone else, I went to several doctors to relieve my anxiety about what was happening.\u00a0\u00a0The rash in my groin was called a fungal infection/heat rash and I was given Clotrimazole and Betamethasone to treat it (primary care doctor).\u00a0\u00a0This lasted for a couple of weeks but did not completely heal.\u00a0\u00a0A dermatologist thought that I should then use Leprox and Denoside Cream in that area instead because he thought that would be less irritating.\u00a0\u00a0The condition definately improved but then it seemed to have spread to my anus, as my primary care doctor said that I now had a fungal infection there.\u00a0\u00a0So I am using the clotrimzole and Betamethasone to treat that.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a fear of Herpes and I took a Western Blot whose results the Doctor said was ambiguous.\u00a0\u00a0The results showed a weak elevatoin for for HSV-2 but were so inconclusive that he suggested I take the test again a few months later, but to presently treat the results as negative.\u00a0\u00a0The anal infection seems to be better after two weeks but is not completely healed.\u00a0\u00a0The area in my groin crevices seem to be almost thin skinned and shiny and still feels a bit irritated.\u00a0\u00a0The canker sores in my mouth are still appearing but not very painful and the corners of my mouth appear to be dry and irritated.\u00a0\u00a0My lower lip appears to be slightly swollen and sometimes burns a little.\u00a0\u00a0All the doctors tell me that it isn't Herpes and that anxiety is playing a factor, which of course it is (HIV test was negative and I am straight).\u00a0\u00a0I did have unprotected sex with someone about 2 months prior who was having their period and could have had Herpes, which may be affecting my psyche somewhat!\u00a0\u00a0Other than that, I just wish this stuff would go away.",
