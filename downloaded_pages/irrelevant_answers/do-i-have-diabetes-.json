            "answer": "You should make an appointment with your doctor or other health care provider (HCP)and get a complete medical workup. You did not say how tall you are, but unless you are close to 7 feet tall 252 pounds definitely means you are over weight. After consulting with your HCP and getting a clearer picture of your medical condition you should consider starting a gradually increasing exercise and diet programs. This is good advice for both diabetics and non-diabetics.I am certain you will get additional input from some of our other very informed participants in the forum.Best of Luck,troytroy",

            "answer": "I agree with everything troytroy said. While nobody on here can diagnose you as pre-diabetic or diabetic you are definitely showing warning signs. I would get evaluated as soon as possible. The good news is that if you learn to eat more healthy and lose some of the extra weight, and perhaps start on an oral medication you can make significant changes in your health. Good luck to you!",

    "question": "Since the beginning of the year, I've started having extreme post-prandial drowsiness. After I eat a meal, no matter what it is (carbs, proteins, etc.), I become extremely overwhelmed with drowsiness. This happens consistently, regardless of when I eat the meal.Also, I am 252 pounds, definitely overweight, and haven't exercised in years. Starting about a few weeks ago, I've become extremely thirsty all the time, and I consume tons of water each day. Also, anytime I consume anything with sugar, I get painful hemorrhoids the next day or two. The consistency at which this happens is alarming. It has come to the point where I can't eat sugary things anymore.And lately, I began noticing a dark patch of skin (surrounded by a swelling) in my neck. It wasn't until I googled \"neck skin disorder\" that I stumbled upon a site about diabetes, which mentioned some of the symptoms I have, which made me really worried. Am I possibly pre-diabetic ? I have no history of diabetes in my family, but I found out that one of the ethnic groups with high risk of diabetes is one that I belong to. What would you suggest regarding diet change ? At this point, I've cut down carbs and I only eat canned meat and hot dogs.",
