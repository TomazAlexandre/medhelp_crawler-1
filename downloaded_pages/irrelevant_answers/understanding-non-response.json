            "answer": "Oxidative StressUsing the breakdown (metabolisim) of alcohol as an example of Oxidative Stress.Alcohol Research & Health\u00a0\u00a0Vol. 25, No. 4, 2001Alcohol and Hepatitis C - Charles S. Lieber, M.D., M.A.C.P.Alcohol (chemically referred to as ethanol) is broken down mainly by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), which converts ethanol to acetaldehyde and hydrogen.Excess hydrogen causes a number of metabolic disorders, including fat accumulation in the liver (i.e., fatty liver) (Lieber 1995).The acetaldehyde, which itself is a toxic substance, subsequently is further metabolized by another enzyme (Lieber 1995).Acetaldehyde contributes to various toxic and metabolic effects of alcohol, but cannot account for all disorders found in alcoholics. Instead, another metabolic pathway called the microsomal ethanol-oxidizing system (MEOS) (Lieber and DeCarli 1970), which also converts ethanol to acetaldehyde, plays a role in some of alcohol\u2019s adverse effects.The physiologic role of the MEOS is to generate the sugar glucose from various precursors; metabolize certain components of fat molecules (i.e., fatty acids); and detoxify foreign substances, including alcohol (Lieber 1999a). Chronic alcohol consumption strongly increases the activity of the MEOS, including that of an enzyme called cytochrome P-450. Several variants of cytochrome P-450 exist, including one called CYP2E1 whose activity is markedly enhanced after chronic alcohol consumption.In addition to its beneficial physiologic function, the MEOS can have some adverse metabolic effects. For example, CYP2E1 has a high capacity to break down some commonly used drugs (e.g., the over-the-counter pain medication acetaminophen [Tylenol]) into toxic metabolites and to generate substances that promote the development of certain cancers.In addition, the MEOS generates toxic free radicals when it has been induced by alcohol. In patients with HCV infection, these free radicals most likely potentiate the HCV-associated oxidative stress and the resulting liver damage. This hypothesis is supported by the observation that in a clinical study, an antioxidant (i.e., vitamin E) that should reduce the level of oxidative stress improved the liver function of patients with HCV-induced liver damage (Von Herbay et al. 1997). The improvement was only partial, however, and occurred in only one-half of the patients.Hepatitis C virus core protein, cytochrome P450 2E1, and alcohol produce combined mitochondrial injury and cytotoxicity in hepatoma cells.Gastroenterology. 2005 Jan;128(1):96-107.CONCLUSIONS: Mitochondrial reactive oxygen species production is induced by hepatitis C virus core and cytochrome P450 2E1, resulting in a reduction of mitochondrial antioxidant capacity and sensitivity to oxidants and tumor necrosis factor alpha. Alcohol further depletes mitochondrial reduced glutathione, which exacerbates depolarization and cell death. Sensitization of mitochondria to oxidative insults is thus a potential mechanism for alcohol-related exacerbation of liver injury in chronic hepatitis C.So what else causes Oxidative StressWell HCV does, being Cirrhotic does. Iron OverLoad does Insulin Resistance does, Being Overweight does.In other words most of the negative SVR predicts are associated with Oxidative Stress and activation of the Cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2E1.Interplay between oxidative stress and hepatic steatosis in the progression of chronic hepatitis CJournal of Hepatology 48 (2008) 399\u2013406Oxidative stress is increasingly recognized as a feature of chronic hepatitis C (CHC). CHC patients show increased serum and liver levels of oxidation products as well as a reduction of the liver antioxidant defences. Proteins adducted by lipid peroxidation products are also detectable by immunohistochemistry in the liver biopsies from CHC patients. Several factors might contribute to oxidative stress associated with HCV infection. Early studies have proposed liver iron deposition along with an increased formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by inflammatory cells as a possible cause of oxidative injury during CHC.However, lipid peroxidation markers are evident also in asymptomatic HCV carriers [11].Consistently, the expression of HCV core proteins in hepatoma cells lines induces ROS production within the mitochondria. Oxidative damage is also evident before biochemical and histological signs of hepatitis in HCV-transgenic mice, indicating that HCV \u2018\u2018per se\u2019\u2019 might promote oxidative stress.The effect of iron depletion on chronic hepatitis C virus infectionHepatol IntKaito and colleagues found that iron-reduction therapy by phlebotomy significantly reduced lipid peroxidation and oxidative stress, which mediate the deleterious effect of iron overload on the liver.Hepatitis C virus and oxidative stress: a dangerous liaisonFuture Virol. (2006) 1(2), 223\u2013232Markers of oxidative stress in HCV in chronic hepatitis CThe presence of markers of OS with chronic HCV infection has been evaluated by determining the levels of a panel of OS markers and antioxidants [7]. This study demonstrated a significant elevation in 8-isoprostane (a marker of lipid peroxidation) and the ratio of oxidizedto-reduced glutathione (GSH), indicating the presence of OS in HCV-infected patients compared with age- and gender-matched controls. In addition, there was a significant reduction in the antioxidants GSH, selenium and vitamins A, C and E.Abnormal findings were more pronounced in cirrhotic patients, although significant increases in OS markers and reduction in antioxidants were found in patients with milder noncirrhotic histology.Fibrosis scores correlated positively with markers of lipid peroxidation and hepatic fibrogenesis, and negatively with antioxidant levels, thus confirming the presence of OS in both early and late HCV-related liver disease. Similarly, in situ examination of hepatic tissue has demonstrated that HCV infection is associated with increased immunohistochemical staining for aldehyde metabolites of polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) peroxidation [8]Mechanisms of Liver Injury III.

            "answer": "Insulin Resistancefrom http://www.wjgnet.com/1007-9327/12/7075.aspInsulin resistance and hepatitis C - World J Gastroenterol 2006 November 28;12(44):7075-7080Manuel Romero-G\u00f3mezinsulin resistance has been found as a common denominator in patients difficult-to-treat like cirrhotics,overweight,HIV coinfected andAfro-American.Insulin resistance together with fibrosis and genotype has been found to be independently associated with impaired response rate to peginterferon plus ribavirin.Indeed, in genotype 1, the sustained response rate was twice (60%) in patients with HOMA \u2264 2 than patients with HOMA > 2. In experiments carried out on Huh-7 cells transfected by full length HCVRNA, interferon alpha blocks HCV replication. However, when insulin (at doses of 128 mU/mL, similar that seen in the hyperinsulinemic state) was added to interferon, the ability to block HCV replication disappeared, and the PKR synthesis was abolished.In summary, hepatitis C promotes insulin resistance and insulin resistance induces interferon resistance, steatosis and fibrosis progression.Two types of insulin resistance could be defined in patients with chronic hepatitis C:\u201cmetabolic\u201d insulin resistance and \u201cviral\u201d insulin resistance.In a cross-sectional survey including 9841 persons, Mehta et al found that HCV-positive persons who were older than 40 years had an increased risk for type 2 diabetes mellitus higher than 3 times compared with persons without HCV-infectionInsulin resistance is the main pathogenic factor in the development of steatosis in chronic hepatitis C, both viral insulin resistance and metabolic insulin resistance could be implied in the development of steatosis.The main deleterious effect of insulin resistance in chronic hepatitis C is the ability to promote fibrosis progression. High serum glucose levels have been found associated with an increased rate of fibrosis progression, greater even than overweight[16]. Mean HOMA index increases with the stage of fibrosis[17] and could help to differentiate stages of fibrosis. Recently, Sud et al[18], proposed an index to predict fibrosis containing age, cholesterol, gammaglutamyl transpeptidase and alcohol consumption together with HOMA.The mechanisms by which insulin resistance promotes fibrosis progression include:(a) steatosis,(b) hyperleptinemia,(c) increased TNF production, and(d) impaired expression of PPAR\u03b3 receptors.In patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving peginterferon plus ribavirin insulin resistance measured by HOMA, decreased in patient with HCV RNA clearance at mo 6, but not in non-responders. At the end of follow-up sustained responders showed a significantly lower HOMA in comparison with baseline insulin resistance index.However, in relapser patients, the HOMA index increased and the levels at the end of follow-up were not different from the baseline.These data support a connection between HCV replication and insulin resistance, and HOMA decreased when the virus was eradicated.Besides, the incidence of diabetes type 2 is different in cured patients than in non-responders, supporting a better control of insulin resistance after hepatitis C virus clearance[13].Thus, measure insulin resistance seems to be easier and comfortable than study steatosis in a liver biopsy. Besides, in 52 patients from UK also treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin, HOMA index was significantly higher in non-responders than patients with sustained response[37].Thus, insulin resistance emerges as the most important host factors in the prediction of response in non-diabetic patients treated with the best available option peginterferon plus ribavirin.Interestingly, insulin resistance has been found as a common denominator to the majority of features associated with difficult-to-treat patients:patients with cirrhosis,obesity,co-infected by HIV andAfro-American.Unresolved question is whether insulin resistance is a marker of very difficult-to-cure or a pathogenic mechanism able to block antiviral activity of the interferon.Peginterferons induce their antiviral activity via extracellular receptor binding. The interferon alpha signalling pathway involves the activation of Janus kinase (Jak1) and tyrosine kinase (Tyk2), initiated by the binding of peginterferon alpha-2 to the interferon heterodimeric receptor complex (IFNAR1/IFNAR2), which leads to activation of their downstream substrates, signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT 1 and STAT2). Activated STAT then assemble as a multimeric complex and translocate into the nucleus where they bind to interferon alpha-2-stimulated response elements in the promoters of interferon alpha-2-stimulated genes[38]. Recently, in a replicon model using Huh-7 cells transfected by full length HCVRNA, interferon alpha blocks HCV replication.However, when insulin (at doses of 128 mU/mL, similar that seen in the hyperinsulinemic state in patients with metabolic syndrome) was added to interferon, the ability to block HCV replication disappeared, and the PKR synthesis was abolishedCONCLUSIONSIn summary, hepatitis C promotes insulin resistance and insulin resistance induces interferon resistance, steatosis and fibrosis progression in a genotype-dependent manner. In genotype 1 insulin resistance decreases sustained response rate, and increase the risk for the development of steatosis and fibrosis progression, in both, coinfected HCV+/HIV+ and in hepatitis C.However, the impact of insulin resistance in non-1 genotype seems not achieve enough importance to impair sustained response, probably due to the high sensitivity to peginterferon. The treatment of insulin resistance, decreasing hyperinsulinemia, could improve sustained response rate in genotype 1 patients with chronic hepatitis C when treated with peginterferon plus ribavirin.Ok so the impact of IR is restricted to G1s. Well no it isn\u2019t.Insulin resistance and response to therapy in patients infected with chronic hepatitis C virus genotypes 2 and 3.Journal of Hepatology 48 (2008) 28\u201334Our data indicate that SVR rates of >90% are achievable in persons with low HOMA-IR values. Conversely, SVR rates drop to the levels seen with genotype 1 infection (<60%) at values above 2.An immediate implication is that irrespective of biopsy findings (which is not mandatory in many countries), genotype 2 and 3 infection with HOMA-IR values <2 can be confidently prescribed the currently available anti-viral therapy. On the other hand, since responses in persons with HOMA-IRP 2 are similar to those achieved with genotype 1 infection, consideration should be given to enrolling these patients into clinical trials that seek to improve virological response rates.In conclusion, the present data suggest that insulin resistance is a powerful predictor of sustained virological response rates to currently available combination therapies for genotype 2 and 3 chronic hepatitis C infection. This effect appears to be independent of fibrosis stage.Those with a low level of insulin resistance as measured by the HOMA score can confidently be initiated on currently available therapies with a high likelihood of viral eradication.On the other hand, treatment decisions in patients with significant insulin resistance should be more circumspect.Hepatic Cytochrome P450 2E1 Activity in Nondiabetic Patients With Nonalcoholic SteatohepatitisAlthough visceral fat strongly correlated with insulin resistance (data not shown) and HOMA strongly correlated with hepatic CYP2E1 activity.",

            "answer": "What about High Viral Loadhttp://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/570035High Hepatitis C Viral Load is Associated With Insulin Resistance in Patients With Chronic Hepatitis CResults: In multivariate linear regression analysis, a dose-response relationship was observed between the log10 HCV RNA level and the presence of IR. IR was positively correlated with body mass index, triglyceride, HCV RNA and alanine aminotransferase levels, but negatively correlated with adiponectin level.Subgroup analysis stratified by HCV genotype showed that there was a trend towards a higher HOMR-IR index value and lower adiponectin levels in genotype 1 patients.Histological analysis showed that IR was positively associated with the severity of hepatic steatosis.What does the following have in commonAgeAge at InfectionLength of InfectionThese are in a way all the same thing. Age above 40 is independently associated with IR irrespective of HCV.Male Sex is also independently associated with diabetes.And Yes IR activates CYP2E1 or is it the other way round.http://www.jbc.org/cgi/content/abstract/M410310200v1Hepatocyte CYP2E1 overexpression and steatohepatitis lead to impaired hepatic insulin signalling.Iron OverloadHigh iron levels don\u2019t seem to activate CYP2E1 but high iron in conjunction with activated CYP2E1 don\u2019t half cause some damage.Iron and CYP2E1-dependent oxidative stress and toxicityAlcohol. 2003 Jun;30(2):115-20Thus, in the presence of iron complexes, microsomes enriched in CYP2E1 are especially reactive in generation of reactive oxygen species.High BMIObesity is associated with both elevated levels of CYP2E1 and Insulin Resistance.Whats Interesting is most if not all the negative predicts have IR, Oxidative Stress and elevated CYP2E1 in common and it crosses genotype, hmmm.Seeing as HCV activates CYP2E1 do you thing it has anything to do with this.The physiologic role of the MEOS (CYP2E1) is to generate the sugar glucose from various precursors.No wonder we become Insulin Resistant and therefore Interferon Resistant.Ya think elevated levels of CYP2E1 is where all the negs start from?CS",

I've read this here before, yet have never seen any info to back the idea up..I can understand age at treatment and liver damage, but don't know if the terms are or should be used interchangably..From the CDCRecommendations for Prevention and Control of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) Infection and HCV-Related Chronic DiseaseAlthough factors predicting severity of liver disease have not been well-defined, recent data indicate that increased alcohol intake, being aged >40 years at infection, and being male are associated with more severe liver diseaseViral hepatitis CTHE LANCET \u2022 Vol 362 \u2022 December 20/27, 2003Factors associated with fibrosis progression in patients infected with HCVDefinitely associated\u2022 Fibrosis stage\u2022 Age at infection\u2022 Duration of infection\u2022 Age at biopsy\u2022 Consumption of alcohol >50 g per day\u2022 HIV coinfection\u2022 CD4 count\u00a0\u00a040 years, and0.20 for age\u00a0\u00a030 years, compared with\u00a0\u00a03 times, compared with 1.5\u20132 times the upper limit of normal).In the analysis disregarding age at HCV infection and duration of HCV infection, older age was strongly associated with moderate to severe hepatic fibrosis (OR, 2.32 for age 36\u201340 years, 2.46 for age 41\u201350 years, 7.87 for age 51\u201360 years, and 7.15 for age >60 years, compared with 16\u201330 years).There was no association in either analysis with sex or source of HCV infection.So I think that Age, Age at Infection and Duration of Infection are all related.Why because at a younger age we are less likely to be IR and have minimal Oxidative stress.As we age we tend to put on weight which elevates CYP2E1 and we also become more Insulin Resistant. Age >40 at infection leads to faster progression, why\u00a0\u00a0because we have IR.Pro - In a sense you are saying the age of the virus itself is a predictive factor..(which maybe I could understand from a selective mutation basis..survival of the strongest virus?)Nah not really. I don\u2019t really believe that the virus becomes truly Interferon Resistant.Otherwise swapping Pegs or switching to Infergen wouldn\u2019t work.But I do kinda agree. I think Oxidative Stress plays a part in quasi species selection which could make us harder to Treat.If IR is one of the main reasons for non response then you would expect to see higher svr rates in those with less IR. Guess what seems to be the case with Asians.One of the main differences between Asians and us in the West is Asians have a much lower bodyweight. Lower bodyweight = lower IR.Here are some studies done on Asians.A randomised study of peginterferon and ribavirin for 16 versus 24 weeks in patients with genotype 2 chronic hepatitis CGut 2007;56:553\u2013559.Results: The rate of RVR and SVR was86% (43/50, 95% confidence interval (CI) 76% to 96%) and94% (47/50, CI 87% to 100%), respectively, in the 16-week group, which was comparable to 87% (87/100, CI 80% to 94%) and 95% (95/100, CI 91% to 99%) in the 24-week group.Patients with RVR had a significantly higher SVR rate than patients without RVR in both16-week (100% vs 57%, p = 0.015) and24-week groups (98% vs 77%, p = 0.002).Multivariate analysis showed that RVR and age were independent factors associated withSVR. Both treatment arms were equally well tolerated. The incidence of alopecia was significantly higher in the 24-week group (49%) than in the 16-week group (20%, p = 0.001).A randomized trial of 24- vs. 48-week courses of PEG interferon a-2b plus ribavirin for genotype-1b-infected chronic hepatitis C patients: a pilot study in TaiwanLiver International 2006: 26: 73\u201381The rate of SVR was significantly higher in the 48-week group (80.0%, 12/15) than in the 24-week group (48.9%, 22/45, P<0.05, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.038\u201316.85).Here are some interesting bit from itIn the 48-week group, the SVR rate was 72.7% for patients with a fibrosis score of 0\u20132, while 100% of patients with a fibrosis score of 3\u20134 achieved an SVR.However, the difference did not reach significance.Baseline characteristicsA total of 60 patients (mean age: 45.4 +/- 10.9-year old, male/female: 39/21) were included in the final analysis.The mean body weight was 68.4 +/- 10.6 kg.The mean assigned initial doses of PEG\u2013IFN 1.41 +/- 0.15 mcg/ kg and ribavirin were 15.6 +/- 1.73 mg/kg, respectivelyLower Body weight higher doses per kg than those in the west tend to have.Ya think IR and Oxidative Stress are low in Taiwan or what.Who says G1s are hard to Treat. They don\u2019t seem to be in Taiwan. 80% svr rates sheesh.So what happens when Asians are treated in the WestImpact of Asian Race on Response to Combination Therapy With Peginterferon Alfa-2a and Ribavirin in Chronic Hepatitis CSVR occurred in65% (34/52) of Asian patients and 45% (171/384) of white patients (P = 0.005).When comparing the two groups by genotype, there was no racial difference observed in SVR rates among patients with genotype 2 (75% among Asians vs 77% among whites, P = 1.00) or genotype 3 (64% among Asians vs 57% among whites, P = 0.55),but Asian patients with genotype 1 had a significantly higher response rate than their white counterparts (65% among Asians vs 36% among whites, P = 0.005). This variation in genotype 1 patients persisted even after adjusting for BMI, fibrosis, and doses of study drugs (OR 2.87, 95% CI 1.40\u20135.88, P = 0.03).When stratified by genotype, the unadjusted rates of SVR show a significant difference between Asian and white patients with genotype 1 infections (65% vs 36%), a finding not seen in patients infected with genotype 2 or 3.Response rates in Asians, in fact, were similar across the three genotypes.Now this wouldn\u2019t have anything to do with Insulin Resistance now would it.CS",

            "answer": "Thanks for the info CS. I don't think their is much doubt as to insulin resistance being high negative predictor of potential svr\"Insulin resistance has been shown to impair virologic response to antiviral therapy. Hyperinsulinemia hinders the ability of PEG-IFN to inhibit HCV replication in thereplicon assay. In addition, patients with insulin resistance,as measured by the homeostasis model assessment\u2013insulin resistance (HOMA-IR),are slightly more likely to fail HCV treatment than patients with a normal insulin index.23 These observations led some investigators to suggest thatusing an insulin-sensitizing agent along with PEG-IFN and RBV in patients with an elevated HOMA-IR score could reduce the risk of HCV treatment failure. However,it is currently unknown which of the various nonresponsepatterns could be affected by insulin resistance or if this strategy would even be effective in enhancing SVR rates.Thus, the routine use of an insulin-sensitizing agent along with PEG-IFN and RBV to treat chronic HCV infection cannot be recommended at this time.\"http://74.125.95.104/search?q=cache:wdmTAMlaIMoJ:www.clinicaladvances.com/article_pdfs/gh-article-200706-sup20.pdf+dartmouth+hitchcock+insulin+resistance+study+hep+c+treatment&hl=en&ct=clnk&cd=2&gl=us",

            "answer": "Hi EpiIn laymans terms the HCV Core Protein Activates CYP2E1.The HCV Core Protein also interferes with both the Insulin Signalling and Interferon Signalling pathways.Elevated levels of CYP2E1 causes Oxidative StressElevated levels of CYP2E1 causes Insulin ResistanceOxidative Stress damages the mitochondria Anti Viral Signalling Pathway.It also leads to Insulin Resistance in part because CYP2E1 is used to make GlucoseInsulin Resistance then activates CYP2E1.Insulin at hyperinsulinemia levels stops interferon from working.Insulin Resistance is associated with virtually all the negative predicts as is Oxidative Stress.All nice and circular really aint it.For something without a brain this virus is pretty smart. It creates an environment that protects it.To calculate your HOMA-IR use the following formulaInsulin (mU/L) x Fasting Glucose (mmol/L) / 22.5. = HOMA-IRIf your insulin is measured in uU/mL or uIU/mL then this gives the same value as mU/L.I think the US Units the formula isInsulin (uIU/mL) x Fasting Glucose (mg/dl) / 405.Gives me the same result when I convert the Glucose value.CS",

Twice never been UND.Not bad for an apparently easy to treat geno type.Now if you are a non G1 non responder there isn\u2019t much out there specific to your genotype.If fact looking for reasons for non response in non G1s just does your head in.Below is what I have learnt about NR. I don\u2019t look at Genotype much now I look more at what the virus does to us and how we contribute. I look for what is common among NRs and what is different between NRs and SVRs. Genotype doesn\u2019t have much to do with that.There are numerous virologic and host factors have been identified that impact the likelihood of SVR.Viral factors impacting SVR\u2022 Treatment Response (RVR, cEVR)\u2022 HVL -HCV RNA above 800,000 IU/mLMore recent studies suggest above 400,000 IU/mL impacts SVR\u2022 Genotype 1Among host characteristics, that been demonstrated to decrease the rate of SVR\u2022 Age\u2022 Age at Infection\u2022 Length of Infection\u2022 Sex\u2022 Cirrhosis,\u2022 African American race\u2022 Hispanic race\u2022 Bodyweight/Obesity\u2022 Hepatic SteatosisOther factors that decrease response rates\u2022 Alcohol\u2022 Iron Overload (Hemochromatosis)\u2022 Oxidative Stress\u2022 Insulin ResistanceBelow is what I have discovered about each of these negativesAlcoholVirology Journal http://www.virologyj.com/content/2/1/89Effect of ethanol on innate antiviral pathways and HCV replication in human liver cellsInfection with Hepatitis C virus is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. With a propensity to progress to chronic infection, approximately 70% of patients with chronic viremia develop histological evidence of chronic liver diseases including chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma.The situation is even more dire for patients who abuse ethanol, where the risk of developing end stage liver disease is significantly higher as compared to HCV patients who do not drink [1,2].Moreover, HCV-infected patients who abuse alcohol have extremely low response rates to IFNtherapy, but the mechanisms involved have not been clarified.To model the molecular mechanisms behind this phenotype, we characterized the effects of ethanol on Jak-Stat and MAPK pathways in Huh7 human hepatoma cells, in HCV replicon cell lines, and in primary human hepatocytes.High physiological concentrations of acute ethanol activated the Jak-Stat and p38 MAPK pathways and inhibited HCV replication in several independent replicon cell lines.Moreover, acute ethanol induced Stat1 serine phosphorylation, which was partially mediated by the p38 MAPK pathway.In contrast, when combined with exogenously applied IFN-a, ethanol inhibited the antiviral actions of IFN against HCV replication, involving inhibition of IFN-induced Stat1 tyrosine phosphorylation.These effects of alcohol occurred independently ofi) alcohol metabolism via ADH and CYP2E1, andii) cytotoxic or cytostatic effects of ethanol.In this model system, ethanol directly perturbs the Jak-Stat pathway, and HCV replication.Ethanol did not appear to have significant effects on ISRE activity at 25 and 50 mM concentrations.However, at concentrations of 100 and 200 mM, ethanol caused statistically significant 3.0 (p = 0.03) and 5.0 (p < 0.001) fold increases in ISRE reporter gene activity, as compared to cells not treated with ethanol.The data suggest that high physiological doses of acute ethanol activate the ISRE, an IFN responsive promoter.This study is interesting because it implies a number of things1.If you drink while on TX then you have to wait until your liver breaks down the alcohol and clears it before IFN starts working again.2. The Anti-Viral effect of Alcohol is probably Oxidative Stress related. Not Good.3. This could happen with other substances4. The Don\u2019t drink cause its like throwing fuel on to a fire brigade have some basis for their views other than the cr@p on alternative treatment sites, They may actually have a point, although the effects of Alcohol on the IFN signalling pathways were dose related, with very little impact at the lower concentrations.So once again it appears to be the quantity of alcohol not just alcohol per se.5.
