            "answer": "This child is definetely not just overweight he has a serious medical condition that is putting weight on him and keeping him from having normal gastro movement.I would start with:1. diabetes2. celiac disease3. EXTENSIVE allergy testing including chemicals, fibers, foods etc4. gastroparesis5. colonoscopy6. upper and lower GI series7. referral to different Endocrinologist and full workup of thyroid and diabetes study8. referral to pediatric GastrointerologistHope this helps, don't stop. You are your childs voice. Don't let drs tell him he is just fat and needs to quit eating. It could be that if he is having absorbtion problems, gastroparesis, or other intestinal issues his body could be in starvation mode and is retaining any and all calories.\u00a0\u00a0If your pediatrician isn't responsive find a new one. Don't give up he is worth it.!!!",

            "answer": "forgot to say. that since having adnoids, tonsils removed and tubes replaced. He most likely has less congestion/blockage. This will increase the amount of pollen/allergins he takes in thru the nose/mouth.\u00a0\u00a0This will increase the amount of drainage down the throat and into the gut. This can cause stomach upset, nausea etc.. Has he been checked for reflux/gerd or other \"gas, indigestion\" issues. Don't forget those as well. You might consider trying a pepcid complete once a day, this was giving to my 8 year old (only 63 pnds) for nausea from drainage and stress. worked beautifully.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck",

            "answer": "Once again Thank you so much for the input!I have never heard of Celiac Disease but will do some research right now and will speak to the doctor about it. I do not know of anyone in the family having it.The sores are on his arms (just a couple) but mostly on his legs, they get infected and never heal ( I would say 10-12 each leg if not more). I was told by his Ped at his 8 yr old checkup that he was retaining fluid in his Lymphatic system. You can press your finger on his calfs and the mark stays there. I have been telling her for awhile that his legs swell and sores do not heal. She keeps giving him Bactrim Cream to put on them but nothing works to heal them so far.",

They seem to not listen to me. I worry so much about him and I just know that all of this is not right. I am heading to do some research on all the information.Also you mentioned drainage down his throat, he does clear his throat alot but the doctor just told me that was habit. He did have reflux as a infant up until he was one yr old, he could keep nothing down. But once he turned one we never had a problem again. He has not been tested for any \"gas\" or \"indestigation\" issues. Did you just give the pepcid otc to your eight year old or was it prescribed? Thanks again for all the information.",

    "question": "I have a Eight year old son, who started to put on a good amount of weight after he had his tonsils, adnoids and tube in his ears done while he was in kindergarten 2005. He then started to have really messy bowel movements with foul smell, stomach pain, gas and trouble staying still and attention problems in school. His ped finally sent him to a GI specialist, in April of his first grade year he was put in the hospital after many many many cleansing where done with no results of cleaning him out. A tube was put in his nose and med was put in, he was there for five days (stomach blockage???) and finally just sent home on Laxative. He has been on and off laxative since first grade, most of time twice a day. They have tested his blood for thyroid problems, several times with no answers. He is now in the third grade and weights 126 pounds at 4'4\" tall (which is going up more rapidly now), he has been dieting for the last year with no weight lose, and laxative two times a day did not make him lose any weight, he is a such an active boy. He goes throught up and down periods with his behavior with no middle ground. He was sent to a Endocrolongist who told me that he was just over weight....Finally after I pushed and pushed they did a MRI this summer of his brain, to look at his pitatary gland (Cushing Disease) with no luck or answers there. Also this summer the GI doctor did a CT Scan and so far no answers there. I am so worried about him....he still has alot of symptoms that range from:\u00a0\u00a0distended stomach, bloating/swelling, lots and lots of gas, red blotchy skin that comes and goes, messy bowel movements (which at times he is in a hurry to get there), also the bowel movements have changed the pigment in his skin around his butt/crack area...little pink/brown color on both sides..... he is always hungry and never gets full, he has trouble staying focused in school, following directions, talking, relating to his peers, sometimes trouble going to sleep. He just finished playing basketball with the park and rec and not even that helped him lose any weight. Just recently his ped noticed that he is retaining fluid in his legs, they are swollen and\u00a0\u00a0sores will not heal. She told me that he was retaining fluid in his lymphatic system. I am so tired of the doctors not knowing what is going on with him. I know that something is up but I just don't know what, any information that you could give me would be greatly appreciated.Thank you so muchOne worried sick mom",
