I have absolutely no idea what Eagles Syndrome is.Forget about GERD.\u00a0\u00a0Your friend has serious issues that should be addressed by both a dietician and a mental health professional.\u00a0\u00a0As a friend, I'd urge her to get professional help to save her life.",

    "question": "Hi all,I have a friend who we have just basically \"self diagnosed\" her with acid reflux - something doctors have not figured out yet.. and she has seen a gastro, pulmo, and ENT.\u00a0\u00a0She may post here soon with more detailed info but I just loved the support I'm seeing at the forum here.She has had what we call a \"cough\" for 3 years now.\u00a0\u00a0It has left her sleepless at nights trying to \"get all of it out\"..\u00a0\u00a0it being the feeling that something is closing up her throat..\u00a0\u00a0 its almost as though she feels if she does not do it - she will eventually gag..\u00a0\u00a0It is like she is trying to clear a sensation in her throat out - she is constantly getting out mucus and with it sometimes comes bits of unknown small particles - sometimes she thinks they are metal splinters, then she thinks they are gum that was stuck in her...I noticed when we went on camping trips to 2600ft elevation from where she lives at 1400ft that the symptoms aggravate even more..\u00a0\u00a0this has occurred several times..\u00a0\u00a0could altitude affect this?some notes about her diet:\u00a0\u00a0 she smokes, she drinks mountain dew, she hardly eats ANYTHING else....\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0would smoking/mtn dew be about the two worst things if shes constantly on an empty stomach?\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Any other input on what she might have..\u00a0\u00a0whats strange is she does NOT have heartburn or chest pressure.. just the esophagus/mucus/throat symptoms...Thanks for any input",
