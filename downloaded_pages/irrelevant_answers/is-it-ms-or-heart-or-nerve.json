            "answer": "Mary,Please do not hesitate to seek immediate medical attention if you think there is the most remote chance of this being heart related.\u00a0\u00a0Time is muscle when it comes to heart problems.\u00a0\u00a0I know first hand, having had a heart attack last January.You don't have to be old to have a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0Young women as well as women my age do have heart attacks,\u00a0\u00a0and usually our symptoms don't look anything like we've seen portrayed on television or in the movies.Please talk to your doctor and get a full workup done - with your family history you are at a greater risk of presenting with heart problems.Take no chances, please!Laura",
