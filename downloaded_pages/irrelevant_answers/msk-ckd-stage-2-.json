    "question": "Hi there,I am a 32 year old mother of 3 and I was recently dx with chronic kidney disease stage 2. Also sponge kidney. I went in for pain in my back, after x-rays they saw my left kidney is pretty much gone, completely calcified and after a scan it fills but never drains causing me pain and my right kidney is only functioning 70%. They think the left kidney was damaged a long time ago, many years. I went to a nephrologist and he gave me the diagnosis however I was left with NO follow up except for a yearly blood test for kidney function. I didnt have any blood work done except in the ER before getting the diagnosis so I am not sure what blood tests the ER did but that is all the nephrologist went by. My question is does what I have usually progress?? Shouldnt I have follow up visits or SOMETHING? I just feel like I am sitting around waiting until it gets worse before they do anything or is there no follow up because it may not ever progress? Thank you in advance.",
