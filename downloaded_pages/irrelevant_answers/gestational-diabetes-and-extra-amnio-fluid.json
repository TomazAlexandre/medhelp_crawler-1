            "answer": "In the Lennart Nillson book (at least, in the latest printing of it) \"A Child Is Born,\" there is a pic of a woman who is having amniotic fluid drawn a la an amniocentesis, and the caption comments she is having this done because there was an excess of amniotic fluid.\u00a0\u00a0(The the next photo shows her cheerful toddler later.)\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if they regularly draw out fluid for women who have this condition (or if only in Sweden) but it seemed to have been considered a serious situation. Don't let your doctor treat it casually is all I can say.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "Actually--I started measuring big in the second trimester---I think that is why I had a early GD test---I was tested around the 26th week-3hr test-Then the fluid started to stay the same or decrease--had extra ultrsounds to make sure everything was normal.\u00a0\u00a0If your insurance will pay for it--have all the us you can--it is awesome to see your little one as they progress.",

            "answer": "I wasn't dx with GD, but did have abnormally high amniotic fluid with my youngest son for no apparent reason. If memory serves me anything above 24 on the AFI was considered high and my smallest pocket was 27.5. From about 27 weeks on I started measuring anywhere from 5-7 weeks ahead on my fundal height.Now the one issue with polyhydramnios is baby continues to have a lot of room to move. Mine did and ended up tying a true knot in his cord which nearly proved disasterous during delivery as we could not get his heart rate above 50 due to that knot. Be cautious, have your doc monitor you closely. My doc (whom I have since fired) ignored all the signs something was wrong, even ignored the polyhydramnios until days before delivery. I had an NST done days before induction which indicated cord/placenta issues and it was at that point she finally checked my fluid levels. She didn't bother checking the cord\u00a0\u00a0during the u/s, had she done that she may have been a little better prepared instead of panicking during delivery.Andi",

            "answer": "It is a risk versus benefit situation, sometimes the risk of having too much fluid is lower than the risk of having the fluid removed as that procedure can send you into labor, introduce infection, etc. I do remember seeing that procedure being done here in the US on one of those birth day type shows on Discovery Health once. The only problem is is that the fluid continues to regenerate, so chances are it would have to be an ongoing thing, and every time the risks would have to be assessed.I do agree though, it need to be monitored closely. I was terrified during the delivery with Tristan. My mom and nurse did their best to distract me from hearing the monitor alarm, but my dh's face told the whole story. He was in serious distress and had I not been pushing like a mad woman, who knows what would have happened. 14 pushes and he was out, but not before a cord prolapse and panic. On his babiesonline website I have a pic of the cord in the photo gallery, it is a scary sight to know his life relied upon that very cord.
