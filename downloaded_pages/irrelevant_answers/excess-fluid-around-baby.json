            "answer": "Gestational diabetes is a common cause of polyhydramnios but not the only cause. It can also occur for no reason, And if not severe, can also resolve on its own. Don't fret. I had SEVERE polyhydramnios with my first, without indication of diabetes and she was PERFECT!!! If diabetes is your cause, it is an adjustment but perfectly manageable.",

            "answer": "Thanks for the reassurance. Things that I breezed through the first and second times seem to be causing lots of anxiety this time! Although I didn't have this problem in either previous pregnancy. I will know more today when I get the results of the initial glucose test and hopefully after the scan on wednesday 5th Jan may have a bit more reassurance. Thanks again.",

    "question": "Hi all, I'm 33 weeks pregnant with my third baby and am 38 years old. I had a check up with the midwife today and it seems there is an excess of amniotic fluid around baby. They did a glucose test as it can be a sign of gestational diabetes apparently. I won't get the results for another two days. I feel huge and am now quite worried! Has anyone else been through this? It may turn out to be nothing serious but of course I looked it up on the internet and could mean a number of quite serious complications.",
