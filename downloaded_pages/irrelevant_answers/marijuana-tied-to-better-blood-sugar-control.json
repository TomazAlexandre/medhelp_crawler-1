It said that more study was needed. They should just ask me, I weigh the same as I did when I was in high school and I don.t have to squeeze into 30\" waist either. I do not get the munchies and I love to run when I am doing my \"studies\". It is nothing like the Cheech and Chong movies, but they are funnier when I am doing a \"study\" while watching them. Keep the studies up...Mark",

    "question": "Marijuana tied to better blood sugar control.The findings, based on surveys and blood tests of about 4,700 U.S. adults, aren't enough to prove marijuana keeps users thin or wards off disease. And among current pot smokers, higher amounts of marijuana use weren't linked to any added health benefits, researchers reported in The American Journal of Medicine.\"These are preliminary findings,\" said Dr. Murray Mittleman, who worked on the study at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.\"It looks like there may be some favorable effects on blood sugar control, however a lot more needs to be done to have definitive answers on the risks and potential benefits of marijuana usage.\"Although pot smoking is a well-known cause of \"the munchies,\" some previous studies have found marijuana users tend to weigh less than other people, and one suggested they have a lower rate of diabetes. Trials in mice and rats hint that cannabis and cannabinoid receptors may influence metabolism.http://uk.reuters.com/article/2013/05/23/us-marijuana-diabetes-idUKBRE94M14C20130523",
