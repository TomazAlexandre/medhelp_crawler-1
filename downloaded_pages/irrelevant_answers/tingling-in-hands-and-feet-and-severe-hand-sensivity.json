            "answer": "Hi!Well vitamin D deficiency could be the cause, but not the sole cause. It may be associated with vit B12 deficiency. Tingling in hands and feet are generally due to peripheral neuropathies or vascular pathologies. Hence peripheral vascular pathologies like deep vein thrombosis have to be ruled out either by angiograms or by dopplar studies. Nerve conduction studies should be done. There are many other causes of nerve disorder causing pins and needles or glove-and-stocking neuropathy or paresthesia including diabetes, hypothyroidism, chronic involvement of liver or kidney, chronic alcohol use etc. Hypoparathyroidism too should be looked into apart from hypothyroidism. Neck strain, spondylotic changes in cervical vertebrae, bone disease or bad posture should be looked into. Nerve infections as in lyme\u2019s disease too should be investigated. Multiple sclerosis and G B Syndrome (less likely) are two other possibilities. Another possibility is TOS or thoracic outlet syndrome which occurs as the result of narrowing of space below and behind the collar bone. Do discuss this with your husband's doctor. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you for the great info. They have done the ultrasound and doplar. There was some abnormalities. And we just got back a report on his vitamin defiency is all within normal limits. The ANA and the RNP are mildly elevated. On that also. Another dead end! He also is going to a new rhuematologiat so maybe there will be an answer there! They did find that when he turned his head they would loose his pulse in his neck.Thank you",

    "question": "My husband is 49 yrs. old. he has tingling in his hands that moves up his arms. His hands will fall \"asleep\" at basic tasks at hand. When he lifts his hands to a 90degree angle they turn white like they have no blood flow. They are now extremely sensitive when he touches anything it is very painful. He is having trouble sleeping with due to the pain. His feet are now slowly doing the exact same things. He has been to a Rhuematologist and she did a complete blood workup. The only thing she said was he was vit. D deficient and ANA antibodies were off. She then referred us to a vascular cardiologist. He is referring him to an ultrasound. We just don't know what to do with all the pain. Could all this be due to the Vit. D deficiency and/or other deficiencies? Or are there other things going on? Peripheral Neuropathy is another something that has been mentioned",
