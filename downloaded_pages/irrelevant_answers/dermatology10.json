            "answer": "Hello,Body odour is also known as Bromhidrosis. Normally the sweat is odorless but due to the action of Bacteria it produces an unpleasant smell. There are two types of sweat glands. Eccrine sweat glands which are present all over the body to regulate the body temperature and Apocrine sweat glands present in the armpits, genital region and breast and secrete certain chemicals called Pheromones. The secretions of Apocrine glands has more protein which is easily broken down by bacteria producing bad odour.Unhealthy personal hygiene, fungal infections, over weight, eating spicy foods and Diabetes are found to be responsible in most cases. The underlying cause needs to be identified first. Remove your underarm hair. Keep the area dry by using a talcum powder. Have a healthy and nutritious diet and maintain good personal hygiene. Add few drops of savlon to the water you use for bathing. Use an antiperspirant deodorant. Wash your clothes in warm water. For smelling in the vagina, you might be having a fungal infection and need to take antifungal treatment. Follow these measures with a positive outlook.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
