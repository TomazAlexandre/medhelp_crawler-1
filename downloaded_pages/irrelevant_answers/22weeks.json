            "answer": "At this stage babies go through different rates of growth and growth spurts, he/she may be big right now, (and that's just an estimate, even with an U/S it's not 100% accurate) and go right back to normal size in a few weeks. My little girl is measuring a week ahead, 3ozs big at my last U/S. Sometimes it means a bigger baby, sometimes it doesn't. If the baby is measuring abnormally big, and consistently, they may test you for gestational diabetes (common for larger babies, but it doesn't always mean you'll have it), but big is healthy, so don't worry!! :)",
