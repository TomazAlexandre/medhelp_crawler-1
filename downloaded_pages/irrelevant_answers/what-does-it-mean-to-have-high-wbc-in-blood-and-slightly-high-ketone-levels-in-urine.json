            "answer": "With keytones in the urine, that usually means Diabetes.Keytones are an acid created when the body burns its own fat. Keytones are common in Type 1 diabetics because the body cannot get enough glucose from the blood. The insulin cannot deliver energy to the body\u2019s cells, so the body has a survival mechanism that begins burning fat. In most Type 1 diabetics there may not be a lot of fat to burn. Diabetics may want to know what their keytone level are as a means of managing their blood glucose levels more efficientlyIts not unusual to have two Autoimmune Diseases,One being Hashimotos (low thyroid hormone levels) and two, Diabetes.I havent come across anyone yet who has Keytones and isnt a Diabetic.Get that checked as soon as possible.Good Luck :)",
