            "answer": "Hi,How are you?It is very unlikely that the headaches are due to VP shunt if the shunt is working properly. Malfunctioning shunt and consequent infections can cause headache.Pituitary microadenomas if they are secreting hormones can be managed medically. Surgery is usually not preferred due to proximity to the optic nerve. However gamma knife radiation is an option.Please discuss this with your neurologist. Take care!",

    "question": "HiI have had a VP shunt since I was born, and have recently (over the past two years) also been diagnosed with an 8mm microadenoma pituitary tumour.I have been having headaches for quite a number of years (every day).\u00a0\u00a0My doctors are unsure whether the headaches are due to the tumour as it is small (it is resting on my optic nerve), and are hesitant to take it out due to other dangers.\u00a0\u00a0They do not think that they are because of my shunt, and feel that the headaches may be migraines.The headaches are generally on top of my eyes (I seem to have more problems with the left one), and can cause quite a lot of pain.I do not drive often, as I find my judgement is impaired (even when the eye soreness is not extreme.\u00a0\u00a0I also have trouble communicating (forgetting very common words, sentences come out back to front, forgetfullness), and need to urinate suddenly and frequently (they have ruled out diabetes insipidus etc).Also, I have pain on the side of my shunt, with the shunt area \"thickening\", and then goes down after some time.\u00a0\u00a0Is it true that as the shunt is old (it is over 10 years old), this may cause headaches?Also, the doctors have admitted that they have not seen a patient with both a shunt and a pituitary tumour.\u00a0\u00a0It would be great if I can have some advice on managing the problems - the specialist is referrring me to another\u00a0\u00a0specialist that deals with headaches.Thank you.",
