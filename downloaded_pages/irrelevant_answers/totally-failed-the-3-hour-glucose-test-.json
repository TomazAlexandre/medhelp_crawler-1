Don't just look at the sugar content because carbs will raise your levels too. They had me diet controlled for awhile with 30g of carbs allowed at breakfast 60g for lunch and 60g for dinner and a snack after each blood check that was no more than 30g. They should send you to a dietician who will give you a sample meal plan to give you ideas about what you can have for each meal.",
