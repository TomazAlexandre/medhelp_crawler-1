            "answer": "First, are these all fasting numbers?\u00a0\u00a0It makes a difference when measuring your insulin and glucose numbers.I can address the high insulin level.\u00a0\u00a0Last October I was feeling tired, groggy, grumpy, impatient, couldn't concentrate, flushed all the time etc.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor ran a two hour glucose test and while my blood sugar numbers were normal (as was yours - glucose of 80 is excellent!\u00a0\u00a0Fasting glucose is normal if under 100) my insulin level was 151!!!\u00a0\u00a0Ideally fasting insulin should be no higher than 10, but my doctor considers anything under 20 good.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, having\u00a0\u00a0high insulin circulating in your body is the first step towards Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Right now your blood glucose is normal, however having high insulin is an indication that your cells are becoming resistant to taking in the insulin which in turns lower your glucose level.\u00a0\u00a0If insulin in the blood remains high, eventually the cells will wear out and will not accept the insulin at all.\u00a0\u00a0At that point, your blood glucose levels start to rise and you on your way to Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 My doctor put me on Metformin (1000 mg per day) and I changed my diet and started excercising more and lost 15 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Within two months my insulin was down to 17.Also, having high insulin in your body encourages your body to store fat.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is called the \"fat storing\" hormone.\u00a0\u00a0There is a book called \"The Insulin Resistant Diet\" that is excellent in describing insulin resistance, what it does to your body and how to eat right so that your insulin remains low and you don't go on to Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend you read that.\u00a0\u00a0You can find it at Amazon.com.Your triglycerides are good.\u00a0\u00a0Under 150 is normal.\u00a0\u00a0Overall cholesterol is normal under 200.\u00a0\u00a0HDL should be 45 - 90.\u00a0\u00a0LDL should be between 0 and 100.\u00a0\u00a0Your TSH is high.\u00a0\u00a0It really should be 3.5 or less.Did your endocronologist discuss these results with you yet?\u00a0\u00a0She/He should address the high insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Even if they don't, you should as you definelty don't want to head down the Type 2 diabetes path.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you can google \"Insulin Resistance\" and find tons of info about it.I hope some of that helped.",

            "answer": "Well, your TSH is 11.0, and you know that should be closer to 1.0.Your free T4 is a little low. I'm guessing the upper limit is around 1.7, so it's not very low.Your T3 may be driving your TSH up. That doesn't look like a Free T3 test, and I have no idea what the lab ranges are for your T3, but you should be getting a Free T3 test done, as it is the most acurate.I just had a long talk with my wife about triglycerides and glucose and insulin, and as she explained it my eyes started glazing over. LOL!!I don't understand it even after she explained it to me.Your cholesterol is a little high, but not enough in my opinion to subject yourself to cholesterol meds and the risks involved with taking them.The insulin level is more important to address than your TSH, I think.I'll do a little research, and hopefully someone better informed will come along in the meantime and help you figure this out.",
