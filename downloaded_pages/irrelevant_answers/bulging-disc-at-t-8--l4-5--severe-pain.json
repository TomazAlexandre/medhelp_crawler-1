            "answer": "Hi.I am so sorry to learn of your condition and how it has been affecting your life. I do hope you would get better soon.Bulging discs can indeed worsen in the time period that you mentioned (10 months) especially if you engage in activities that put increased stress on your spine, such as lifting or carrying heavy loads. However, other conditions might also cause some of your symptoms and this is probably why an MRI was done, to determine if there are any underlying brain-related conditions leading to your condition.Are your other concomitant conditions adequately managed? Diabetes and fibromyalgia can lead to similar symptoms, if left uncontrolled, as will spine stenosis and degenerative disc disease.It would be best to wait or the results of the MRI and go on from there.Have you been referred for any physiotherapy? Physical therapy is an important part of the treatment of conditions such as this and might help ease some of your symptoms. Heat can also be applied to the affected areas as this has been reported to be of some benefit in relieving pain.Hope this helps.Good luck.",

            "answer": "My diabetes is fairley well controlled, my fasting blood sugar in am is around 110.\u00a0\u00a0My PCP just perscribed the Lyrica for the fibro, I have taken vicodein for years for the pain and recently switched to Tramodol. Not taking anything for the stenosis or DDD. I haven't been referred for any physiothrapy, but do get massages when I can afford them. I do know my PCP has ruled out lyme disease, & lupus, and the brain MRI is to rule out missed diagnosis of MS.\u00a0\u00a0Just waiting gets worrisome, but at this time of the year with all of the holidays, can't expect quick answers. Thank you for your reply, I truly appreciate it.",

    "question": "A year ago in Feb, I had discectomy at C 5-6 due to a herniated disc. An MRI also showed bulging discs at T 8, and L-4-5. The past several months I have had increasing pain, numbness, and tingling in my legs, to the point of having trouble walking by days end. One trip around a mall does me in too. I drive a car for 8 hours for my job. Can these bulging disc's worsen in 10 months? I just had a brain MRI with and without contrast for \"progressive peripheral neuropath of unknown origin yesterday. Won't get results until next week. My mid-spine hurts all of the time, but my lower back, left hip and both legs hurt all of the time. Any ideas of cause would be greatly appreciated. I have Type 2 diabetes, fibromyalgia, carpal tunnel in both wrists, stenosis in my spine, DDD. I was just put on Lyrica but it hasn't helped with the nerve pain yet. Any other treatment suggestions. Also take pain meds, Tizanidine for muscle spasms. I'm getting to the end of my rope. I must work, as I am a widow, 60years old. Help!",
