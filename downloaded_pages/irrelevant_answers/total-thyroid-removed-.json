            "answer": "This side of the forum is community based. You will get patients thoughts here.Why are you not on a T4 medication too? You should be.Adding T4 can assist you with a balance than just taking a short lived t3 medication spilt 2x's a day.Cytomel is only a 4 hours cycle in the body so your swings up and down could be your reason for the insulin issues.Your doctor should consider looking at balancing out a Sythroid T4 med once a day - with keeping Cytomel as you are directed to take.",

            "answer": "I'd also be very concerned and become very knowledgeable on watching your TSH and FT3/FT4 levels with your recent Dx of pap cancer.Your TSH will need to be suppressed below 1.0 to be in remission. One full year and a body scan should be done to make sure there is no lingering tissue still growing.The Cytomel you take helps many patients keep the TSH suppressed when Dx with cancer and I feel keeping that - with a T4 med - could be your best hope here.",
