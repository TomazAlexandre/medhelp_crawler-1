            "answer": "Shannon of course you feel rotten, your blood sugars are constantly very high.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure you feel irritable and exhausted and you might be losing weight because of all the excess sugar in your body that is spilling over into your urine.\u00a0\u00a0Not to mention you probably feel nauseous and probably do not feel\u00a0\u00a0like eating because of the high sugars.Why are you not trying to get your blood sugars under control?\u00a0\u00a0Even if you are going through something you should try to get your blood sugars under control. We as diabetics are supposed to try very hard to get our Ha1c under 7.\u00a0\u00a0I guarantee if you get better control of your blood sugars you are going to feel much better.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think things would be so hard for you if you got tighter control.That said have you seen a dietician and are you regularly seeing an endocrinologist?\u00a0\u00a0I am assuming you are because you know your Ha1c levels.\u00a0\u00a0Is your endocrinologist very concerned about your readings because he should be and so should you.\u00a0\u00a0Not only will you feel better if you get tighter control but you will lessen your chances of getting complications from diabetes if your blood sugars are under control.",

            "answer": "Shannon, for me personally, the key to keeping good control is testing often and adjusting to what I see. If you do that every 3 hours or so, your a1c numbers come down all by themselves and all you do is test and adjust. No real miracle except that you do that first blood sugar test and give appropriate quick-acting insulin to normalize it. Then you repeat in a few more hours. I am a graphic designer, and I design some of our nation's coinage. I assure you that when working on a tight deadline for this important work, perfect glucose control is the key to any possible artistic success. I cannot think clearly or \"create\" when my brain is not able to access sugar properly. I notice that if I go either high OR low, I can't create effectively. It really will help you in many areas of your life if you just start the first test-and-adjust and keep doing it. You are taking the first step by realizing that something needs to change. Good for you! I wish you the best.",

            "answer": "Sounds to me like you weren't properly Trained on all the phases of Treating your Diabetes with your Insulin/Pump etc...starting with Carb Counting vs Sliding scale to having a Sliding scale for taking a Correction Bolus to get them down to Properly,\u00a0\u00a0not even being Told you have to test every couple of Hours...to Figuring out what your Basil rates should be.. ( if On MDI, probably s/b splitting the does every 12 hrs) and if on Pump,will have several different basil rates thru out 24 hrs...Suggest you first go see a CDE and start over from the Basics on up... and once you understand all these parts, you can eat what you want, when you want and know how to keep things under alot better control...Having a High A1c is .like trying to function on less than a few hours of sleep...and your nothing short of being a Zombie...>If your\u00a0\u00a0family can't afford a CDE? Then You and your parents can go the self taught route, as many of us have too do( with better results I might add ) and get the following Books>John Walsh> Using Insulin>Think Like a pancrease>Dr. Bernsteins Diabetic SolutionWithin in a few weeks of Reading and following these Books guides, you will be anew person in no time..",

            "answer": "Well I am 17 and I was just diagnosed 3 days ago. I had no clue. I am a very very health young man. I rarely get sick due to my strong immune system. Just before Thanksgiving I started to loose weight and by this month I had lost 44 lbs. When we found out that I have type one diabetes we instantly knew why I lost so much. My A1C was above 13 also. My blood sugars levels 2 hours after each meal have only reached under 350 once. I don't seem to be irritable or anything, i do not feel sick, since I have been eating less and not having sugar, I have been feeling really tired and down. Your blood sugar level is at such a high level that it makes sense that your feeling so bad. You need to exercise, get at the very least 10,000 steps a day, eat meals with no more than 45 carb (3 carb choices), eat 3 meals and 3 snacks a day and only 2 carb choices a snack. Drink plenty of water. I hope this helps a bit.",
