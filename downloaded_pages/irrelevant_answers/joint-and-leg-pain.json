            "answer": "Dear Patti O:Sorry that you are having such difficulties.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you have hypothyroidism, you should be on replacement medication and subsequently euthyroid (normal free thyroid levels).\u00a0\u00a0Hence, this should not be the cause of your problems.\u00a0\u00a0What is the etiology of your sciatia?\u00a0\u00a0Do you have rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune disease, diabetes, etc.?\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you need to see a neurologist and get a full examination and some lab testing to begin to understand what the underlying disease is causing your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0There are many things that can cause your symptoms, but one needs to treat the underlying condition and not just the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I do hope that you get to the bottom of things.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "I am a 44 year old female with hypothyroidism and sciatica.\u00a0\u00a0I have severe joint pain in my hands and feet. It is so bad that it will wake me up at night when I move.\u00a0\u00a0Also, when I get up I have to be careful because it hurts to move.\u00a0\u00a0It has gotten to the point that my hands hurt all the time now and my feet burn.\u00a0\u00a0I have pain going down my left leg from my lower back and it will cause cramps in my knees and hips.\u00a0\u00a0I had a bone scan last year and all it showed was that I had mild scoliosis; so; I was diagnosed with sciatica and told it was probably worse due to stress.\u00a0\u00a0I am wondering if either my hypothyroidism or sciatica could be causing all these symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0I also have trouble getting up from a kneeling position, I have to climb out instead of just using my legs.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry my post is so long.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you for you assistance.",
