            "answer": "Alot of times one autoimmune disorder has association with another. There is an autoimmune disorder called polyglandular autoimmune syndrome and they can have thyroid, chronic yeast, and another kind of autoimmune problem-alopecia areata, or diabetes, or adrenal or other concern. This may be alopecia areata or indeed this is a hair cycle phenomenon now that she is back on treatment. Be sure firstly that her levels are good, next ask for referral to a dermatologist, they can help clear things up. Also ask about having her screened for celiac disease and check for anemia and other vitamin deficiencies like B and Zinc. Be sure she is on a multivitamin.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response. I will be talking to her Dr. She already has a dermotologist and he looks at her patchs and perscribes new medications every 3 months. Her levels were high (way out of wack) Her Dr. upped her medication for the second time. I have noticed that after she has gone up on the meds her hair loss is greater after a week or two. She does not have anemmia.I will continue a dialog with her Dr. as well as seriously look into having another Dr. look at her records and examine her. I just feel that their might be something else going on that might be bigger than the two sperate things that she has had dianoised.Thank you again.Ellie",

    "question": "My 3 year old Daughter was dianosed with HypoThyriodism about a year ago. About a month after starting her medication she started loosing her hair. Her Doctor said that it was alopicia and gave her a topical steriod. Her hair has started to grow back but iother patchs are coming out. Everytime that I speak with her doctors, (pediatric endocrinologies and demotologist) they just kind of dismiss my worries. I think that either hshe might be allergic to something in the medication(levothriod) or there is something bigger going on with her. Either way, how do I get her doctors to listen to me? Should I get another opinion.",
