            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!The swelling and numbness of feet could be due to water retention as in low protein in blood, kidney problems, heart problems, pressure on the dorsal aorta, severe anemia, deep vein thrombosis, liver diseases etc. It could be due to hypothyroidism too. Diabetes Mellitus too can cause similar symptoms. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. You can refer to this link for a complete list of possible causes for ankle, leg and feet swelling: http://en.diagnosispro.com/differential_diagnosis-for/bilateral-leg-edema-swelling/39352-154.html",

            "answer": "HiThanks for keeping me posted!Please do not worry about all the medical details. It was only for further information. If you have hypothyroidism, then do consult the specialist regarding your foot problem. Also test for diabetes, anemia, kidney and heart problems if need be. It could also be a simple case of age related osteoarthritis. As you can understand a confirmed diagnosis is impossible on net.Please discuss this with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
