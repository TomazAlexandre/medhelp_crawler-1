            "answer": "Hello,From the pattern of baldness like it being hereditary, it sounds like male pattern baldness. Androgenic alopecia is a common form of hair loss and typically occurs in M shaped pattern.Men who have this type of hair loss usually have inherited the trait. Other causes may be use of some drugs, infections and underlying disease, such as lupus or diabetes. A biopsy (taking a small sample of cells to examine under a microscope) of your scalp may be needed to establish the correct diagnosis.Depending on your type of hair loss, treatments are available. If a medicine is causing your hair loss, your doctor may be able to prescribe a different medicine and if it is due to infections or systemic disease,then treating it will treat baldness.Medicines which are useful are minoxidil and finasteride. Finally one can resort to hair transplantation also. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi, my name is Chris and I am 26 years old. In about the last 6-9months I've started to notice my hair becoming especially around the front of my hair. My hair line has began receding quite dramatically and the hair at the front of my head has become very thin. Obviously my impending baldness has caused some stress and I have only noticed this since going through a very stressful 6months, splitting up with a long term partner, changing jobs and relocating. Even more recently, around the last 2 months, the area on my head most affected has become itchy all the time and the itch almost feel like a burning sensation. Is there anything you could recommend that may help with the hair loss?",
