            "answer": "What a tough boat you;re in.Keep at it with the doctors.In terms of pituitary, do they test all the pituitary hormones to make sure they're all ok.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes pituitary surgery can result in problems with that.Also is your hypothyroid well managed?\u00a0\u00a0Do they test FT3 and FT4, not just TSH.\u00a0\u00a0For people with pituitary issues sometimes TSH doesn't give the true story.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure your thyroid levels are optimal (FT3 and FT4 should be mid to high normal).\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I also have thyroid and pituitary issues.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor doesn't pay much attention to TSH and instead looks at the other levels.Hope this at least gives you some other things to look at.Sally",

    "question": "ok, so sept of 2006 i had a pituitary tumor removed and since then I have accumulated more symptoms and I really think it could be MS.\u00a0\u00a0I have had the MRI, which apparently was negative, but then again that doesnt mean anything.\u00a0\u00a0My left legs or left side of body go numb even sometimes while walking.\u00a0\u00a0and sometimes even the right side.\u00a0\u00a0I then get slight tremors when trying to hold a cup or pencil.\u00a0\u00a0Cognitive aspect;\u00a0\u00a0shot to hell.So my neurologist has also done some other testing; you know the electric shock in the legs and feet and arms and hands; which came back with some problems.\u00a0\u00a0I have ringing in the ears and hearing loss.\u00a0\u00a0since the surgery I have also been diagnosed with Vertigo; which drives me absolutely crazy.I have a family history of MS amongst other lovely things, but still my dr had me do a diabetes test to rule that out.\u00a0\u00a0However, I have had diabetes tests over the past 2 years all neg.So why the heck does it take so long to get a diagnoses?\u00a0\u00a0Well I know one reason is that I am also Hypothyroid and have been for the past 10 years; however, like i said before I have gotten new symtoms since my surgery and I am just absolutely frusterated.\u00a0\u00a0I cant even do my work (profession) as my cognitive ability is so bad.......uggghhhhh.What else can be done?\u00a0\u00a0AT my witts end with this.......",
