            "answer": "Stress does affect blood sugar levels. However, they don't affect them hugely. You are most likely pre-diabetic. Pre-diabetes can easily turn into diabetes or not. Maintaining a healthy diet and exercise will go a long way to combat becoming a diabetic.",

            "answer": "To prevent word confusion I think you meant fast/fasting not fest/festing. Fasting means no food and no colored liquids [water is OK] for 8-10 hours prior to testing. Also, the doctor/tester must be made aware of all medications including supplements, vitamins, and aspirin that you are taking. Ignoring these simple rules can have negative effects on your test results.The results of your first test says diabetes, not prediabetes.These are the fasting test values:* Normal is 60/70 to 99 mg/dl* Prediabetes is 100 to 125 mg/dl* 126 mg/dl and above is considered diabetesYour 2-3 hr OGTT levels says diabetes* 2-3 hours for diabetics should be <141 mg/dl, optimum<121 mg/dl.* 2-3 hours for normal people = normal fasting [above]Stress can play a part in raising glucose levels, but not as high as your results indicate. Your endo can verify diabetes with an A1c test [no fasting required]. Ask for it if he/she doesn't mention it.Contributing factors to diabetes: overweight, poor nutrition [eating sugary foods and liquids, high carbohydrate diet [foods made with white flour, white breads, pasta, potatoes, and starches as these turn into sugar after digesting], and lack of daily exercise.",

    "question": "Hi,I was just diagnosed with diabetes today. My fest glucose level was at 170, and I did the 3 hours glucose tolerance test. The results were 290 after the first hour, 248 after 2, and 210 after 3. Also, there was glucose in my urine.After that, I did another blood/urine test (without festing at all), and no glucose or ketones were found in my urine, and my cholesterol was 169, which I think is perfect.Also, I have passed through a near-death experience about three weeks ago, when the place where I spent my childhood was nearly destroyed before my eyes (in the floods that recently attacked the southeast of Brazil), and I feel that I am not over it yet.Given the second test result, and the level of stress I am feeling, is it possible that the diagnosis is wrong? I should say that I am a little overweighted (6'3' and 256 lb).I will still see an endocrinologist in about two weeks. Should I have any hope on not having diabetes?Thank you in advance.",
