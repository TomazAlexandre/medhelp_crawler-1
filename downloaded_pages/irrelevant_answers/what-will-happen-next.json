            "answer": "I do NOT recommend routinely getting heart catheterization \"just to see\" if there are progressive blockages... unless you have new CARDIAC symptoms such as pain, shortness of breath or passing out due to arrythmia.I DO think there are several to-dos here, and you might have gone through some of these already, but there they are:First, we need to define how much cardiac symptoms you currently experience and how your quality of life is. Are your limited by symptoms of chest pain with little exertion? Are you going to the hospital frequently due to congestive heart failure? Look up the NYHA class for heart failure and the CCS angina grades for YOU.Secondly, we should define how much of your heart is SCAR from coronary artery blockages, how much is HIBERNATING (alive but not contracting), how much is ISCHEMIC (alive, contrating, but frequently deprived of blood supply due to narrowing arteries), and how much is normal.\u00a0\u00a0I would discuss with your doctor a CARDIAC PET STRESS + VIABILITY\u00a0\u00a0test, which would lay out the above four categories in %.\u00a0\u00a0This gives you and your cardiologist an idea of how much muscle is gone and never coming back (SCAR), and how much we have to save by performing a revascularization procedure (repeat CABG or a stent).Third, you might need to discuss the need for a defibrillator (ICD) to prevent sudden arrythmia due to muscle scars.\u00a0\u00a0We recommend this for anyone with heart function (LVEF) < 35% (you mentioned yours is 30-40%?).\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes your EKG might suggest that you would benefit from a fancier type of ICD (called CRT-D or \"three lead\" defibrillatro/pacer) which could help improve the mechanics of your heart pumping.Lastly and most importantly, you need to have a strict regimen of low cholesterol diet, blood pressure lowering medications (sounds like you are already taking, good!), and monitor for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Your cholesterol profile needs to be maximally improved with statin medications and diet, if not already.This is a lot of information, and I am still quite unfamiliar with your situation (how many of these 10 cath's resulted in stents? if any? also when mammary arteries fail it typically means the original artery is actually OPEN -- this is the case?).\u00a0\u00a0If you are unclear about these, or feel that your cardiologist is unable to provide these information, I recommend taking a\u00a0\u00a0\"health inventory\" and get a second opinion at a larger cardiac institution.Good Luck!",

            "answer": "Of the 10 caths no stents, I already have an on demand pacer and I take lovastaton for cholesterol I also take plavix\u00a0\u00a0and 325 aspirin\u00a0\u00a0and the artery that failed is not open and it's to risky to restent. I don't get chest pain till after exertion when I am relaxing I am about ten pounds overweight and I do smoke I have alot of arm pain and so so much digestive trouble no diabetes though I don't take any blood pressure meds I only have the two arteries pumping all damage is to the front of my heart where do I look up the NYHA STUFF",

            "answer": "Based on what you added, I do NOT recommend another cath, when the previous 10! did not find stentable areas.\u00a0\u00a0You need to get to a cardiologist who will address the smoking, and the lack of medications such as an ACE inhibitor, which is indicated in someone with your heart function.",

    "question": "I am 46 yrs old and have had a tripple bypass 8yrs ago. After my bypass one of the bypass arterys closed, the mammry one. Since then i have had 10 caths. I am very aware of my condition so i am always feeling every little beat and pain in my chest. I just went to the doc and now only 2/3rds of my heart is working my efr is 30-40 my bp is 117/77. I am not ready to die so i guess my question is what can be done to help my situation? Can i have another bypass surgery? Should i keep having caths to see if arterys are in danger of cloggin, i have no family history of desiease it just hit me. I just want it to be better, looking for answers i guess. Thank u",
