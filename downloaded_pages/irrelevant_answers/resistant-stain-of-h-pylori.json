            "answer": "You may want to google the title \"New Concepts of Resistance in the Treatment of Helicobacter pylori Infections,\" and find out what the latest article have to say about the problem.But also keep in mind that H. pylori upregulates your acid pumps, so it's possible what you may be contending with is acid reflux as a result of the H. pylori infection. So you may need to be following a GERD diet and remain on a course of either H2 blockers or PPIs to try to depress the production of acid in your system.Also check out the articles on the use of certain probiotic products and their helpfulness in eradicating H. pylori.You may also need to check to see is there is some common 'source' with which you may be re-innoculating yourself in some manner.",

            "answer": "Despite the fact that culture is the gold standard in the diagnosis of H.pylori, there are a limited number of clinical laboratories that isolate this organism routinely. Culture is considered to be an essential method only for research purposes at this time more typically because of the cost. But at some point it's going to need to be done (almost routinely?) because of the need to establish susceptibility patterns in H. pylori isolates from patients in whom standard antimicrobial treatment has failed. You're going to have to contact labs individually to see if they have the capability and to determine the cost. You'll also have to find out in what 'form or presentation' they need the sample.",

            "answer": "Antibodies to H. pylori may stay in the blood for years, so they may be all from previous infections, but also from new ones, so atibodies are not enough to determine if infection is fresh or not. I personally believe that breath test is the most reliable. Breath test doesn't determine the type of bacteria in the stomach, but it determines their presence/absence. H. pylori is the only harmful bacteria found in stomach so far (by may knowledge), anyway.If antibiotics helped in all your previous infections, it means, you were probably cured at the time, meaning that H. pylori was not resistant, but simply re-occured. It happens also to others. The other possibility is, that most of bacteria were killed, but few were actually resistant and they slowly regrew and causes symptoms again. If this was the case, then biopsy should be made, and antibiotic susceptibility testing made.Here's one pretty long and detailed article about H. pylori, you need to register (it's quick reg.). The link below opens a page, where antibiotic susceptibility is described.http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/450385_8",

            "answer": "If you insist in antibiotic suceptibility test, you need to give a sample from gastric mucosa taken during endoscopy. Only this way actual bacteria may be obtained, cultured and susc. test made.I seriously doubt that they can find H. pylori in vomit. In the stool, only H. pylori antigens are found, not live H. pylori.But again, before undergoing any testing, you should be aware that there are two possibilities: H. pylori is antibiotic resistant OR you simply get reinfected, no matter which antibiotics you were cured with.One study has showed that dental procedures may cause H. pylori reoccurencehttp://www.isomed.com/english/news/news.htmAnother one says that \"Previous studies have shown that the vast majority ofpatients with recurrent HP infection have recrudescent infection rather than re-infection.\" This is said in the last sentence of article under the link belowhttp://www.sma.org.sg/smj/4108/4108a3.pdf",

            "answer": "Well, try to eat. Have small meals. To prevent nausea or acidic pain, you should avoid animal food (meat, fish, eggs, dairy), also other protein food: nuts, beans and soy. Not totally exclude it, but limit it. This way food will pass the stomach faster. Also avoid acidic foods: fruits, any alco, vinegar, vit C, aspirins.To prevent bloating, you should avoid anything sugary and potatoes.You can still eat rice, bread, corn foodds, most vegetables. Water is OK.The way of transmission of H. pylori is not known...Hygiene rarely harms, though.",

You say no diarrhea/nausea now.Why are you saying \"ulcer\", if there was no one found by endoscopy? Also, what was doctor's explanation of gastric erythema and especially of duodenal atrophy? Celiac disease was excluded?You also sweat at night? You mentioned burning feet in the 1st post - this goes with this heat after the exercise? Anyway, I think you should have your hormones checked.

            "answer": "FBS in diabetes is above 120 mg/dL, so this may be pre-diabetes. Symptoms correlate with diabetes symptoms a lot, EXCEPT this warm feeling. Hypotension is also not typical for diabetes, unless you're constantly dehydrated. (\"Carcinoid syndrome\" came accross my mind. In this syndrome a hormone-secreting tumor develops in the pancreas or in the intestine. Secreted hormones may cause this warmth and hypotension. If it grows in the pancreas, it can also cause diabetic symptoms. I'm not very convinced in this diagnosis though).Again - endocrinologist. You need post-exercise glucose level checked. Maybe after the exercise your glucose suddenly falls, and this would explain pretty much all of your symptoms.",
