            "answer": "Yes, levels of 590 is super high.\u00a0\u00a0I am surprised that you are not very ill with it.I would suggest that you take another reading.\u00a0\u00a0But before you do, wash your hands thoroughly to make sure that they are clean and that there is no contamination of sugar on your fingers in the event that you picked up anything sugary.Your glucose monitor only shows the amount of glucose in your blood at the time you take your reading.If you haven't seen your doctor yet, do make an urgent appointment so that you can be given the right advice and information and medication to bring down the levels and know how to manage and control your sugar levels once they reach the required goal.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor will advise you on this.In the meantime, you can help yourself, by eating a healthy and well balanced diet and cut out (or drastically cut down) on sugary and processed foods.\u00a0\u00a0Eating brown bread for example is a better option that having white bread.\u00a0\u00a0Cutting out cakes, biscuits and being aware of the sugar content of low fat foods.\u00a0\u00a0Although low fat foods may be low in fat, they can contain a lot of sugar.",
