            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Burning pain in the arm and wrist and hands can occur as a result of trauma which can result in nerve compression due to fracture and nerve damage.Prozac or Fluoxetine is not known to cause these types of symptoms. Peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or B12 deficiency can be other causes of burning pain and need to be ruled out.Take care!",
