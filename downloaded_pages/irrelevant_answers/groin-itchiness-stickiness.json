            "answer": "Hi,Going by the description of your symptoms, it definitely seems to be a recurrent yeast infection. Prolonged antibiotic use increases the risk of a yeast infection. Also, those with diabetes or impaired immune systems are more susceptible to yeast infections.Fungi normally thrive in warm, moist areas. Though they are present in the human body they only becomes a problem when the normal balance is upset, which can happen due to a number of causes.Hot weather, being over-weight, stress and wearing tight or synthetic clothing which increase moisture and warmth can foster fungal growth.You need to get your blood sugars done since this does seem to be recurring frequently.It is treated with an over-the-counter antifungal treatment, such as Monistat.\u00a0\u00a0Apply the medication directly to the affected skin twice daily for a week.Sweating and the other medical conditions that you have mentioned do not have anything to do with it. Continue to keep the region clean, dry and well aired to prevent recurrences.Ref:http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/male-yeast-infection/HO00172",

            "answer": "I have the same exact problem.It's been just over a year for me. I am on my fifth dermatologist, who finally tested things. Two of the earlier docs said it was eczema and gave me steroids which made it much worse. I currently try to control the amount of sugar and complex carbs I eat. The doctor did a scraping and biopsy. The scraping came back pos for fungus but the black light did not glow the way he said it would if it were yeast. He said that doesn't prove it isn't yeast. Stress is definitely part of my problem. The first couple of idiots that said it was eczema scared the **** out of me. I made the mistake of reading about it and convinced myself I had that horrible disease.I hardly ever itch but sometimes it turns red and burns as if acid were poured over it. Their is absolutely no scales no dryness no flaking just stinging and burning. When it happens it will last an hour or two then disappear. It is never present when I wake up and hardly ever when I go to bed. When I sweat it goes away completely. The more I sweat the better it is.I was tested multiple times for every std, diabetes, and other possibilities.The next step is to start taking meds for anxiety, But I am afraid as most of the possible side effects would affect my job. One is loss of weight I am 5'11 and 145lbs. I currently can't gain weight.",

            "answer": "Testing your blood sugars will probably come back normal. Antifungals don't work because the problem is inside you not topical. When I took oral antifungals I broke out in a rash all over my body. They then tested my liver, which was normal.Keep in touch if you find any info, because so far I am just getting more frustrated.",

    "question": "I have been experiencing groin and inner thigh stickiness, especially when hot for over 2 years now.\u00a0\u00a0My groin always seems moist.\u00a0\u00a0Syptoms also include mild burning at times with mild to sometimes painful itching/tingling.\u00a0\u00a0The area sometimes even feels sunburnt. There is no rash associated with it and no discoloration.\u00a0\u00a0I have had small red bumps(only 2 or 3) in the first year in my pubic area that have opened and were very sore.\u00a0\u00a0One of them when opened, left a small lesion.\u00a0\u00a0I have had none since.\u00a0\u00a0There is also a small area on the under side of my penis that might possibly be a group of warts.\u00a0\u00a0Also, no dryness( I wish!) or scaling as with Eczema.I have been to my MD who did a swab for yeast which tested positive I was treated both orally and topically with no relief.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been to a Dermatologist a couple of times who looked at me like I was nuts.\u00a0\u00a0He barely did an assessment.\u00a0\u00a0Meds I have used are Econazole, Fluconazole, Clotrimazole/Betamethasone, and other steroid creams.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing works.Lately it also seems the palms of my hands and bottoms of my feet get sticky when I sweat.\u00a0\u00a0Is this related?I have been diagnosed with restless leg syndrome and spinal stenosis, is there possibly a neuologic cause?All in all I am very frustrated, usually treating the area with baby powder to promote dryness.\u00a0\u00a0HELP!This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/242651\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/242651</a>.",
