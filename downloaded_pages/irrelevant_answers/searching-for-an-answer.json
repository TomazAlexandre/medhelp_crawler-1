            "answer": "Hey! You sound like me!All I can say [because you did not mention it] have you spoke to a doctor about over active hormones?About 15 years ago my doctor realized my problems were hormonal and I was prescribed a very expensive birth control pill [sorry! can't remember the name of it for nothing] and after the first month I was loosing weight like crazy! I use to ovulate 6 times a month which was making me so extremely sick and that birth control pill stopped it all! I had to stop taking it because it was\u00a0\u00a0so expensive!And now I have different health issues along with the normal weight problem as always. I do not have Diabetes nor Hypoglycemia, I was just checked and after reading your post I have a bad feeling they are going to do me like you. I am being checked for my Thyroid next!All I can say is it is very frustrating!I am very active but, I am always exhausted even after a nap or from sleeping through the night. I work\u00a0\u00a0full time and take care of my kids and run everything at home [divorced mom]. So I will not just put it on stress because I believe everyone has different levels of stress.If you find out anything new please share your thoughts.Good Luck!",
