            "answer": "if you reckon you're having spells of hyperthyroid dont think you're imagining it - coz it means something is wrong that is bothering you!i'd suggest getting your tsh tested by the doctor so they could help you adjust your dose - if you are hyperthyroid then they'll reduce it!with not taking medicine for 2 days / month - usually with thyroid medication (well t4 - synthroid/levoxyll) its not sposed to affect you for a few weeks. (with me its like 10 days and then 21 days!)i also have the issue of not wanting to offend my doctor - coz the last one was hopeless (well actually worse than hopeless - like she told me i had chronic fatigue for 5years - until my mum suggested she test me for thyroid a year ago - and recently she actually tried to tell me im sick because im depressed - even though the thyroid results showed a high tsh and 256000 antibodies (which is like 256 times normal)!!!!!), so maybe if they're the type that does get offended they're not worth going to? (although im not sure if there's any other type)",

Some dr.'s are worth keeping.Good LuckTeresa",

She didn't think I needed a specialist because \"all you have to do is bloodwork and she can order that to be done when she does my other bloodwork\"\u00a0\u00a0I will have to teach her that it isn't just doing bloodwork every 6 months.

            "answer": "I went to my primary care doc (I don't like her) and told her all my symptoms feel like I still am Hypothyroid but that a min. of 6 days out of every month (lately) I have felt Hyperthyroid.\u00a0\u00a0I also wanted to be checked for Diabetes and menapause(My husband swears that menapause is my problem) Well she gave me a hard time and said she would do the bloodwork but that my thyroid is fine and is controled well by the medicine... Well the joke was on her.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have Diabetes, I am not in menapause BUT my thyroid is too close to the hyper side. HAHA I wish that she would just once say sorry for treating me like I am an idiot.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse didn't tell me my exact readings but called in a new script for a lower dose. I went from\u00a0\u00a00.150 mg to 0.125 mg. She also ordered more bloodwork in 7 weeks. She also told me to stay away from my PC because I see illness' and then I have it.\u00a0\u00a0I never went in there asking for tests done for what I have seen on the internent.\u00a0\u00a0Two other doctors and a few friends that knew my symptoms told\u00a0\u00a0me to get checked for Diabetes and my husband wanted the menapause test done, not me. I want to find a different doctor but am affraid that I might find someone worse. My last doctor who moved out of the city was bad but the one they handed me off to is worse. Thanks for responding to my plea for help again.\u00a0\u00a0Sincerely Sharon",

    "question": "Does anyone else still feel the same symptoms months even years while taking the medicine correctly?\u00a0\u00a0My bloodwork gets done every 4 to 6 months and it goes up and down.\u00a0\u00a0In June it was 3.5 which by the new scale makes me still Hypo but in November it was 0.7 which is\u00a0\u00a0close to Hyper. Right? From day to day I feel bad but a few times a month I actually feel very Hyperthyroid. I lose weight, don't sleep much,I have more energy,I even talk more & I don't even crave carbs. When I go like 3 nights with little sleep I then get fatigued. The first time this happened I decided to not take my thyroid meds for the next 2 mornings and then I felt back to my \"normal\"(which is hypothyroid unfortunetly). I have never felt normal and I really shouldn't play with my meds that way; I've done it 3 months now (only stopped meds 2 days each month). My doctor said that she could take care of my thyroid and do the bldwk when I asked her for a referral to an Endo. Should I risk hurting her feelings or am I immagining these spells of Hyperthyroid?",
