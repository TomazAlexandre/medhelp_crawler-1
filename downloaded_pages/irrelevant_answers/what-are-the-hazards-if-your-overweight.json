My son was 5lbs 10oz and he was only 2 weeks early. My daughter was 6lbs 14oz and she was 3 weeks early. I am now pregnant with my third and besides a few minor utis and a yeast infection this one has been fine. I think it all depends on the person. Hopefully you wont have any problems. Congrats!!!",
