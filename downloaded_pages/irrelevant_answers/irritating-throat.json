            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, there are many causes of dry throat. Some causes of dry mouth/throat are Anxiety, Systemic diseases like Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome, Amyloidosis, Sarcoidosis, uncontrolled diabetes mellitus and Dehydration. Even existing sinusitis or acid reflux can cause trickling in the throat.Even certain medications are known to cause dehydration like Antidepressants, Antihistamines, Anticholinergics, and Diuretics etc.Drugs like Pilocarpine or Cevimeline, which prevents dry mouth, should only be taken after consultation from physician. You need to drink lot of water to maintain water level in the body. Sinusitis should be managed by appropriate antibiotics.You need to under investigations like blood sugar; chest and sinuses radiograph to rule out the causes. Allergy is unlikely in your case to cause dry throat. I hope this helped you. Take care and regards.",

            "answer": "I saw an ENT and the Doctor told me that it was a slight case of acid reflux. He told me to take Prilosec and watch what I eat and when. It's been 4 days now and it has gotten better but not completely. I have been taking 4 1200mg of Omega 3 pills for about 2 years now. I read somewhere that Omega 3 pills can give you acid reflux. I take it right before I goto bed. I wonder if I take it in the morning or even spiltting it up could help. My throat just feels a little aggitated, much better than before. Oh, also I have been taking Tums before I goto bed, seems to help.",

    "question": "I have had irritation and tickling in my throat for about 3 weeks now. At first it felt like a hair in my throat. I went to see my doctor and she said it was allergies. She put me on Astepro. I used it for about a week. It started to effect my tongue. My taste buds in the back of my tongue enlarged for some reason, so I stopped. The taste buds seem to be fine now. Now my throat mainly in the afternoon, feel dry and tight. Could this simply be allergies. I have been taking Clariton, but seems to be not working.\u00a0\u00a0When I eat or drink, my throat feels fine. I just want to make sure it is not anything worse than allergies.",
