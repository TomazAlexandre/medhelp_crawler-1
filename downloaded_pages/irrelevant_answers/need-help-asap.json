But just since we got Suzu, as I said, some days it has to be refilled up to 5 times. (to give a better idea of just how much extra she drinks compared to a Yorki that is nearly twice her body weight)She is also the runt of the litter if that makes any difference.",

    "question": "My mom has had a Morki (cross of Yorki and Maltese) for just over 3.5 years now, just today she started having seizures (or at least we THINK they're seizures).Normally we DO feed our pets scraps, but usually just barely anything, maybe 1 bite of something off of our plate at supper, however, today Suzu (the dog having seizures) had more than usual, as well as ALL of it being sugary foods. She had a small bite off of a twinkie (very small, maybe the size of the tip of my finger) and later on in the day, we were having cake for my mom's birthday, and she gave her a LARGE bit of icing, so much she couldn't take the icing in 1 bite. It's a store bought cake with buttercream icing so its VERY sweet and sugary.About an hour later, my mom was taking a nap for work (she works night shift) and I heard scratching on the floor, which Suzu is known to scratch at the floor, as if trying to \"make her bed\". I said \"stop it!\" so she wouldn't wake mom up, who was sleeping on the couch, but the sound continued, and I looked over and saw her tail sticking out from the other side of the coffee table wagging, which is strange due to her normally not wagging her tail when digging, and NEVER wagging it when being scolded, so I stood up and walked over to see what the hell was going on.Once I got over to look I noticed her head jerk, I thought maybe she was playing with something, like throwing a bug around or something, and started to turn around and just leave her alone when I realized she was still scratching the floor, so I beant down and touched her, it's hard to tell by just looking at her, she hasn't had a haircut in a long time and it's hard to tell where a lot of her body parts are, but when i touched her i could tell she was on her side, convulsing and her legs were moving so violently it sounded as if she was trying to \"dig\" the floor as she does sometimes.I woke mom up and she rubbed the dogs back and whispered to her until she calmed down, and when the episode stopped, she \"flipped\" off the floor, completely landing on the opposite side she had been laying on during the episode. We've kept a close eye on her and tried researching seizures in dogs.We're not 100% sure if this was a seizure because we read after a seizure, dogs act tired and confused, even as if they were sedated, while Suzu ran around franticly, running between the couch and the wall (very tight spaces) and out the other side of the couch, viciously and i mean VICIOUSLY digging at the floor, couch, blankets and other things. This is all VERY unusual for her. She is normally a VERY lazy dog that sleeps 12+ hours a day and when she is awake, just lays around on the couch not doing much at all. Very rarely she'll try to play and chase feet.The first seizure took place around 7 hours ago, now she has just had another. This one seemed more violent, her mouth was opening and closing very hard, making a loud sound as her teeth slammed together, her legs moved alot more and A LOT faster, she was on her side again and looked as if she was trying to run full speed as her mouth opened and closed and her head moved back and forth. However, when it was over, she did not \"flip\" into the air, but instead just looked around.I know NOTHING about seizures or anything at all about dog health, but I personally believe this could be a diabetes issue. She has NEVER had a seizure. We got her as soon as she was able to be taken from the mother and will turn 4 years old on christmas eve. And with her being almost 4 and nothing even similar happening until she had a very large amount of sugar, the only possible thing I can personally think of is a diabetic seizure.I've been brought to believe she has diabetes before now as well. I don't really know much at all about diabetes, but I have HEARD (not sure if its true) that diabetics drink A LOT, and she drinks multiple bowls of water every day. Every time she gets a drink, she gulps down the entire bowl of water at once, rarely coming up for air.Something possibly unrelated, I've never heard that diabetics eat less, but she does not eat much. She eats a very little amount of food every evening when mom refills the bowl. At times, she will eat during the day, but only a few bites, if the bowl isn't constantly fresh, she normally turns her nose up at it unless she is very hungry, but 99% of the time, right b4 time to refill the bowl, our full bred Yorki finishes off the food from the day before.Due to not eating much, she is VERY skinny. More than once we've worried that she has worms because of her bony structure and have had her checked, but she does NOT have worms, so my only assumption on that issue is that she don't eat enough.Both dogs come from a yorki/maltese/morki breeding kennel. They both at times, have breathing problems. They sound almost as if they are having an asthma attack, we researched the issue and found that the breathing issue is common in dogs that come from kennels. This issue usually only happens when they get too excited and when it all began, we were too scared to touch them because we didn't know what was going on, but now have found that it almost immediately stops their breathing issue when we softly pet them, like it calms them down and makes their breathing fit stop. (This little paragraph most likely has NOTHING to do with any of this, due to our Yorki being 2 years older and nvr having any problems other than the breathing one)We really can't afford to get a lot of tests done, so I would really like someone who knows more about this kind of stuff than the vets here in this small town. I've encouraged a diabetes test, but many tests are expensive and we need advice and opinions on what the problem may be so we can tell the vets exactly what tests we want done so that we can find the issue with the least amount of expenses.NOTE: After this 2nd seizure, she has ran around franticly yet again, digging in blankets and the couch. After the first one she dug in the couch for almost an hour straight, however this time she only acted frantic and full of energy for around 10 - 20 minutes and has already calmed down again.",
