            "answer": "How long has this been happening? I can't think of anything other than a chemical dependency in your body for the sweets or an auto immune disease. But with the sweats and being thirsty, it sounds like you may eat a good amount of sodium. Typically speaking, high sodium intake makes you retain water but your body will also at times try to expel the surplus by triggering you to drink so that it may flush out the extra. Do you eat a lot of high sodium foods? It may help you to drink pure water when you have these occurrences. No, cookies and water don't take good together but try giving your body the best liquid supplement and see if there's a change. Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "It could be possibly be hypoglycemia. I would recommend buying a cheap glucometer and checking your sugar levels when you feel this way, before you eat the sweets. Keep a journal and present it to your doctor if you have abnormal results. Normal glucose levels are about 70-110. Hypoglycemia is usually associated with diabetes but not always. good luck to you. hope this helps.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You will be surprised to know that stomach ulcers and severe acidity can result in hunger pangs. Even GERD presents with similar symptoms. At times the hunger pangs due to acidity wakes up a person in the wee hours of night. The symptoms could be exacerbation of the GERD. It could also be hiatal hernia. Treatment is a combination of drugs to reduce the acid and lifestyle changes. You will need to take a combination of medications (under medical supervision) like a proton pump inhibitor such as omeprazole,\u00a0\u00a0lansoprazole or pantoprazole empty stomach in the morning and an antacid gel after meals for complete relief. Possibility of H pylori infection too should be looked into by a carbon urea breath test and a combination antibiotic tried. Many a times a persisting H pylori infection can be the cause behind acidity not responding to treatment.Life style changes that will help include: Avoid heavy meals and eat frequent small meals. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, smoking, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Avoid lying down for least 2 hours after food. Go for a late night snack along with cold milk. This remedy takes care of early morning pain and burning in the abdomen. Maybe these tips will help you.You should consult a gastroenterologist (a specialist who looks after the diseases of our digestive system) or a physician for this if these tips reduce your symptoms. You may need upper GI endoscopy for confirmation and to know the degree of damage. Take care!",

    "question": "I wake up in the middle of the night several times out of a deep sleep to eat sweets---all night. I could eat about 5 cookies, fall back to sleep, wake up suddenly and eat another 8-9, chase it with juice, go back to sleep and wake up to do the same thing. I'm always sweating and thirsty, as well but the doctor has said I do NOT have diabetes. If not diabetes, then what IS this??? Please help.",
