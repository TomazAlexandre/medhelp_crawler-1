            "answer": "My son has had cronic constipation for years.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't until I noticed him straining and crying did I demand action be taken by his pediatrician Dr..\u00a0\u00a0Which helped a little but not like this specialist is doing. No, neither Dr. diagnose him with encopresis.\u00a0\u00a0The GI specialist at Childrens Mercy are starting at the bottom and ruling out any possible diseases that are common but show no symptoms (ie: Thyriod, Anemia, Diabetes, and Celiac disease) before they start on Crones disease which is hereditary and his biological father has.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortinitely his bio father did not show for this very important Dr.'s appointment so the Dr. was unable to ask family history questions from his bio father.\u00a0\u00a0Sad for my son but I will continue 100% of my efforts to see to it that my son is NEVER in that kind of pain again.\u00a0\u00a0We will strive to continue on the Myralax with efforts of relief in sight someday hopefully.Heavy fiber diets may include \"gluten\" which if he is diagnosed with celiac disease would only intensify the constipation problem.",

            "answer": "Oh have I been in your shoes!! It is horrible seeing your child go throught this..we thought our son was doing this on purpose when he was about 7yrs old and we had disiplined him. None the less, this sounds like what my now 10yr old son has which IS called Encopresis. We have a wonderful Dr which prescribed him a laxative (sort of) called Lactulose he takes every evening before bed. The dose will vary on the severity of it. We started him on 3 teaspoons for about 1 week with added enemas 2 times weekly to rid his colon of all the back up. Then lowered it down to 2 teaspoons. This was heavenly sent. We have not had ANY issues what so ever, exept when we attempt to take him off it occasionally recommended by his Dr. She said alot of children experience this problem and need to be on medicine into their teen years, but that the medicine is not habit forming. It just makes it easier to have a bowl moment. See if your doctor will give Lactulose a try. There is a good web site that gives great information about this and other issues http://www.kidshealth.org\u00a0\u00a0just do a search on it. I wish you the very best of luck.",

    "question": "It is obvious a lot of us are out there with children who continuously soil there underwear/panties.\u00a0\u00a0I wanted to inform you about my child.\u00a0\u00a0My son is 7 he began pooping/soiling his underwear for months.\u00a0\u00a0We were very pissed over the pooping of his pants daily.\u00a0\u00a0I began to literally watch my son when he pooped. To my sad surprise. I watched my son's little toes spread out as far as they could go, while gripping the toilet seat as tightly as he could and begin to cry.\u00a0\u00a0I was heart broken, pissed and demanded someone (Dr.) do something to help him.\u00a0\u00a0I took him into the Dr.'s where they were getting ready to dismiss it again. I looked at her (Dr.) and said you will do something this time or refer me to a specialist in this area.\u00a0\u00a0She recommended me put my son on Myralax. One cap full with 8 ounces of water a day for possibly up to a year depending on how bad his colon was.\u00a0\u00a0After 6 months he was doing so much better so I began to decrease the dosage. MY MISTAKE.\u00a0\u00a0His colon was not opporational yet.\u00a0\u00a0He went right back into his soiling. I took him back into the Dr.'s after the year and she didn't know so she referred me to a GI specialist at Children's Mercy Hospital.\u00a0\u00a0This Dr. was surprised that my primary physician had not told me to increase the dosage.\u00a0\u00a0He has now as of 1-22-08 went from 1 cap full a day with 8 ounces of liquid to 3 cap fulls a day each with 8 ounces of liquid mixed in. In by sunday 1-24-08 he was pooping again.\u00a0\u00a0Please dont' feel embarassed every dr. will tell you this is extremely common. Dont' take that as an answer demand help.When or if you decide to take your child to the dr. ask them to run 4 blood test Anemia, Thyriod, Celiac and diabetes tests.\u00a0\u00a0One of these diseases can cause the colon to back up and soiling to happen. This is the stage my son and I are in, Blood Testing. I hope this helps ANYONE who has the same problem my son has.mom_of_5",
