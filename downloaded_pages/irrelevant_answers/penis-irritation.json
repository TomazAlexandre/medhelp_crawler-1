            "answer": "Hi,It is good that you are cleared with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The irritation can be due to the soap, detergent or type of clothing you use. However,\u00a0\u00a0since this has been happening for quite a long time already, other differentials such as balanitis, infection, or\u00a0\u00a0dermatitis may be considered.Penile irritation is more common in uncircumcised males due to lack of aeration and irritation because of presence of smegma and discharge . Are there other signs or symptoms present? It is important to keep the area clean and dry and to avoid sugar if this exacerbates the irritation. If your condition persists, it is best to see your doctor for further evaluation and management.Take care and keep us posted.",

            "answer": "hi,I have a similar issue. I, for a while now have had whatseemed like dry skin on\u00a0\u00a0shaft and it is irritated when something rubs against it. It's as if the skin was damaged and is trying to heal itself , but because of where it is and because the shaft shrinks when not erect air can not hit it, causing the long delay in healing. I've been told it's like a form of psoriasis/eczema. by a derm. Sex irritates it greatly. Use alot of lubrication. I think unless we walk arround naked all day for a month or so, we{whomever has this issue} will have this for a Very long time. Any suugestions for healing irritaed skin. Other then hydrocortizone cream.",

            "answer": "I am a 40 yr male in sw florida. I have had for some time now what seems like dry skin in the shaft of my you know what.\u00a0\u00a0It lookes like a dry wrinkly thin bag when healing. When it gets errect or something rubs against it in abraisive manner it starts all over. I pretty much can't do anything that will damage the area. AT ALL.\u00a0\u00a0I have been told by a dermitoligist that it is what he thinks is psoriasis or eczema or possibly an irritant that I am have been using for a while. that caused it. I'm not so sure. But he did a biopsy and it came out neg. {Fungal and Bacterial.} Anywho, what it lookes like is Dry skin that has been rubbed off and is trying to heel. But because it goes into hiding when not errect this healing procces is taking a VERY long time. What I know about skin is that you need good circulation, a strong immune systrm and air for skin to heal itself. Is this true and does anyone have a solution other than hydrocortizone cream to heal in this area ?\u00a0\u00a0I have been using it but with slow results.Thankyou for any response that may be helpful. I think the only solution though is time\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0and NO SEX.\u00a0\u00a0UUUGH",

    "question": "I am 48 and was circumised at 5. At 30 i noticed that sometimes i have irriation on my penis .It may get worsened by taking more sugar . I have been tested against Diabeties and am negative. The area that is itchy is on the circumcised part (middle) between the top mushroomy part and the bottom shaft where i guess that is the skin that has been affected during the circumcision. anyway I use antipresperents (alcohol base) to reduce the irritation and it comforts it for maybe half a day but then it comes back. I have been given anti thrush cremes but they give temp relief and nothing permanent.Please advise if this is a common problem or not.Thanks",
