            "answer": "Liz headaches and leg cramps are very common in pregnancy. Try ice or heat on your head for the headache and the leg cramps sleep w a pillow between your legs, stretch your legs before bed or try extra calcium (but don't over do the calcium it can cause kidney stones). I hope this helps. If you are concerned it is diabetes related speak with your OB about having the glucose screening done or other testing. Feel better :)",
