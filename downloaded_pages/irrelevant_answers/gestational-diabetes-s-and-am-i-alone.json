            "answer": "I had GD with my last pregnancy. We tried to control it with diet but it didn't work. I was put on insulin injections. Not fun but we do what we have to do! As a result of the GD, I had low amniotic fluid that was caught via routine u/s at 36 weeks and was induced at 37 weeks. Thankfully, baby was fine. She had jaundice and temp control issues but was otherwise ok.",

    "question": "Well I think I included this in my last update. I finally caught it. I caught my blood sugar going sky high. As high as 216.... not good at all. It makes me worry about my baby. My doctor said we are probably going to have to put me on some kind of medicine to control it..... since it's not because I'm pregnant or the way I'm eating. It's cause of the amount of steroids I have to take. Those of you who were/are diagnosed with gestational diabetes... What did your doctor do? What effect did this have on your baby? Did you get put on medicine for it? Just let me know what you ladies went through. It is appreciated. Thanks. By the way I'm 30wks....Also is it just me or what?? But I'm 30wks and I feel like I have a big basketball in front of me. I have problems getting up off the couch, bed already. I'm not even comfortable sitting. It sucks!! I feel so miserable.",
