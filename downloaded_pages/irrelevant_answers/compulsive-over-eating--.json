            "answer": "Hi there.\u00a0\u00a0Well, are you truly concerned?\u00a0\u00a0I only ask because you put in a LOL at the very end.\u00a0\u00a0I think that pregnancy hormones can trigger chemicals in the brain and the overeating and craving of massive sweets that you binge on until you throw up could be related to that, similar to an eating disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Ha, I've never heard of a pregnancy induced eating disorder though.\u00a0\u00a0But people with an eating disorder often have that same lack of Impulse control.What I would try to do is to not have so much on hand.\u00a0\u00a0And then buy things like strawberries and oranges which have a high natural sugar content and substitute it.\u00a0\u00a0Make a peanut butter and jelly sandwich which has some sugar in it.\u00a0\u00a0Pick things that may have sugar but also other nutrients rather than just straight baked goods or candies.\u00a0\u00a0??I love sugar myself!!\u00a0\u00a0But oddly, when pregnant, I never have the taste for it.\u00a0\u00a0I like things like cheese and meat that I don't eat as much of when not pregnant.I do think we craver certain things for a reason.\u00a0\u00a0anyway, enjoy the sweets but try not to eat so much you toss your cookies!",
