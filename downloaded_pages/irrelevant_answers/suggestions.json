            "answer": "It sounds like you are doing great, given a 100% RCA blockage.\u00a0\u00a0Some people can develop colaterals, and others can't, I'm told. I'd keep up the drug regimen, and mix in some salads in your diet to get your ldl colesterol below 75 and your hdl above 50.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that you can walk uphill with low BP is incredible. You are obviously exercising, and it sounds like the meds plus exercise are serving you well.For whatever reason I have poor luck developing collaterals, even after taking the good drugs, exercising daily for ten years, losing a lot of weight.\u00a0\u00a0However, I smoked cigarettes for a long time, and I do believe those pimp sticks affect the ability to develop the blessed collaterals.\u00a0\u00a0I've had to have five stents inserted in the RCA and three in the LCA.I'd keep doing what is working.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us informed.",

            "answer": "\"However, I smoked cigarettes for a long time, and I do believe those pimp sticks affect the ability to develop the blessed collaterals\"Well, I smoked 30 a day for 20 years and developed Collaterals. Maybe another way to see it is that the reduced Oxygen level caused by cigarettes along with the occlusions building up in my Coronary Arteries, acccelerated collateral growth. Who knows.",

            "answer": "Collateral vessel development can be inhibited by diabetes, hypertension an athrosclerosis.\u00a0\u00a0With good collateral flow, there shouldn't be any cause for concern...but collaterals can develop stenosis as well so it is not a cure for the RCA blood flow.",

    "question": "50 years old and just diagnosed with 100% rca blockage. Also have 2 other 40% in lad and 100% in lcx but in small area. Apparently I have \"extensive collaterals\" and advised to go on meds for treatment instead of single bypass. Put on lipitor,asa,ace inhibitor, betabklocker and plavix. Family history of heart attacks as father died at 55 and brother at 49, Male hdl in family around 40 (mine) and females around 80. total cholesterol around 230. before meds could not walk far without angina - after two weeks of meds can walk 3 miles uphill and flat outdoors. bp 115 over 75 and heart rate 60. Use to be 135 over 92 and 80. Any comments about not bypassing rca and just continueing with meds AND about how good can collaterals be would be appreciated.This discussion is related to/posts/show/251516.",
