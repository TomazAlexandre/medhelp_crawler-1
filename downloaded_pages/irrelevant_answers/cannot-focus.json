    "question": "Hi- (I am 5'4, 130lb Indian-Asian) for the past year or so, I've noticed a pattern of getting very tired immediately after eating. It doesn't matter if I eat a huge meal, or some fruits. With in 10 minutes, I feel as though I've taken an antihistamine and fatigue flows through my body in pulses almost. I lose all concentration, all focus, my muscles feel tired and this continues until I either take a nap or I drink lots of caffeine. Lately, the caffeine hasn't been able to keep me up either. A more recent symptom over the past 6 months or so has been profuse axillary sweating. Again, this is more so right after eating, and more so if I don't take rest after eating and exert myself. I went into the doctor the other day and had a GTT done. Here are the results:Fasting glucose level: 82After 30 minutes:\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 151After 1:30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0139After 2:30\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 71 mg/dlI was told I was hypoglycemic and maybe even prediabetic and was told to change my eating patterns. But that makes no sense to me because I dont feel sick when the sugar levels fall, but more so when they rise. I took in only proteins today and the symptoms persisted even after eating just meat, or eggs. I do not feel ill hours after eating (ie glucose level of 71mg/dl or at fasting glucose level). I feel ill immediately after my meal! Can you please help me figure out what is going on? I'm a student and this is really starting to have a horrible effect on my studies and concentration. I am constantly hungry and I feel like my brain isn't being fed no matter what I do. Please help.",
