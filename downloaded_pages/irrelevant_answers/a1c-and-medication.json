            "answer": "What is your hesitation? Some people do get side effects from Metformin (stomach) but many do not. I took it for a year with good effect and no side effects. You might want to talk with your doctor about your concerns. 130 is high for fasting blood sugar. It's a fairly common progression for Type 2 diabetes to need a bit of help from oral meds after a time. Good for you for doing well on the weight loss, diet and exercise!",
