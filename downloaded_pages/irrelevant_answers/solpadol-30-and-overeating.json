            "answer": "Hi!Well taking 8 tablets a day of Solpadol can cause addiction, constipation, dizziness, abdominal pain, bleeding gums, euphoria etc. It is unlikely to increase your appetite.Increased appetite could be due to acidity and stomach ulcers. The other possibility is diabetes, hyperthyroid states and worms in the gut. All can keep you hungry 24x7. Blood tests to rule out diabetes and hyperthyroidism and stool test to rule out worms will be needed. Though a rare disorder, pancreatic insulinomas should also be thought of in your case and have someone check your blood sugar while you have an anxiety *** hunger attack. The hypoglycemia in this is transient and there is a quick increase in blood glucose once you eat.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
