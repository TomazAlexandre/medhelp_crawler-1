            "answer": "How are you? Do you drink more than 8 glasses of water everyday? Are there any other symptoms associated with your cloudy urine?Usually, healthy urine is light yellow. This is because adequate amount of fluids dilutes the urine and gives it a clear appearance. There are several things that can change the color of urine such as vegetables and fruits such as beets, blueberries and asparagus, vitamin B2, food coloring and prescription medications. Sometimes,\u00a0\u00a0cloudy urine is a result of phosphaturia, a benign condition in which excess phosphate crystals form in urine that presents itself after eating, laborious exercise, and especially after severe mental labor. It also occurs largely with night or morning urination wherein no fluids were consumed so urine is more concentrated, which is perfectly natural and no cause for concern.I hope this helps. Take care and keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. Can I ask a few more questions regarding my urinary problem?\u00a0\u00a0i drink alot of water everyday, a glass every 1 hour. Recently I need to go toilet about 3 times in 1 hour especially in the morning and night after drinking a lot of water. My husband said that maybe i am worried too much and that is why i need to go toilet so many times. The doctor said that i had Urinary tract infection but i dont think i had that as i still urine frequently and sometimes it is even cloudy. This problem really bothers me so much until I am scared of going to toilet now and always think of passing urine all the times. I also feel the pressure on my lower belly after passing urine sometimes. I just went to the doctor last week. Should I go one more time? What could my problem be? I am very worried until cant sleep well in the night.",

Together with frequent eating and frequent drinking of water or fluids, this can point to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Do not be scared of going to the toilet.
