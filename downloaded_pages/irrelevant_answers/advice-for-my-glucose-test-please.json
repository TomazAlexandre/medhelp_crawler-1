            "answer": "Actually I want to specify. Im not trying to cheat the test. I have known people who didnt end up having diabetes but they failed the first test but then had to take the second one and they passed that. I would just hate to not have diabetes but have to do the three hour test for no reason just because I ate something that screwed up the first test. Any advice would be great!!!",

            "answer": "Aside from not eating anything sugary (candy, cake, pop), I was told to eat normally for my one hour test.\u00a0\u00a0My results were just slightly higher than their cut off point, so I had to go for the 3 hour test and had to fast after 12 midnight.\u00a0\u00a0I passed that one just fine.I know you hate needles and would hate to have to go for the 3 hour test, but I think you should eat like you normally would and just cut out anything overtly sugary.\u00a0\u00a0If you do have GD, it would be better to catch it early while eating normally than to fast and screw up the results.\u00a0\u00a0Talk to your doctor's office and find out their instructions for your 1 hour test.",

            "answer": "I agree with SweetAngel, don't try to change the results, you need to know things as important as GD - it's really NOT that bad, and it's important for you and your baby, especially since every mother wants their baby to be as healthy as it can be.",

    "question": "I have my Glucose test wednesday morning and Im worried about it! I hate needles so I really really need to pass this so I dont have to do the longer one. My mom told me to cut sugar out of my diet a little before I do it. What else should I do to improve my odds of passing. Are carbs ok or are they going to be the same as sugar in terms of me failing?!?!? Help!!! how do I pass this thing?!?!",
