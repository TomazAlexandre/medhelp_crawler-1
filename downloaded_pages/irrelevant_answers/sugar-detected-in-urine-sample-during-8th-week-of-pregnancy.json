            "answer": "Hi! I am currently 14 wks 3 days pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0I had to take a early glucose test due to my weight.\u00a0\u00a0I failed the 1 hr test and the 3 hr and have gd. I freaked at first. But he has given me a strict diet, and a monitor to control my sugar intake.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to be going pretty good now that i am controling my sugar intake.\u00a0\u00a0With my first glucose it came back 155.\u00a0\u00a0So they may go ahead and give u a glucose test. But my dr informed that as long as you do keep your sugar down your not considered high risk and everything could still be ok.\u00a0\u00a0I have a 6 yr old and didn't have gd with her, so i understand, i was a little upset too.\u00a0\u00a0Well good luck and i hope everything will be ok for u!! :)",

    "question": "HiI had my first visit with my OB\\GYN today and I was told that they take urine sample during my every visit every month.I had my first visit with a midwife 2 weeks ago and the sugar was normal in the urine.Today the nurse said that I did have a little high sugar(200) in my urine. She said that it might even be related to my breakfast that I had this morning(which was 4 slices of bread, egg and a glass of milk with a tsp of sugar). She also tooka blood sample to do the test but the results are not out yet.I've been going through various articles on the internet about gestational diabetes and it is freaking me out.I'm really very worried. I hope that the high sugar is just one time and related to the carbs that I had this morning.Anybody faced this during their pregnancy here?",
