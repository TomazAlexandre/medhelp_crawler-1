            "answer": "I don't see how you could get anything from the hot wet towel. First they give you clean towels in a salon to start with. Secondly, they are hot and this kills bacteria and viruses. Thirdly you would have to have a open cut on the exact area where you touched the towel.\u00a0\u00a0Your symptoms are from something else.Are you taking any medication? Some medication can cause the tingly feeling. Also diabetes can cause this and rheumatoid arthritis. It may also be a reaction due to stress.\u00a0\u00a0Or even a local burn if the towel was that hot.mkh9",

            "answer": "I am in need of help, as the pain in my joints are unbearable today. It has spread to my right hand now. I am afraid to move for the pain.I am thinking this is an infection that has occurred in other parts of the body, not just the scrotum.I should get the results for Gonorrhea and Chlamydia tomorrow. Do you think this could be reactive arthritis from one of those two infections? Either that or bacterial or fungal infection of some kind.This is probably due to a sexual encounter with someone I didn't know very well, a one-night stand, about two weeks ago. We used a condom, but I could have gotten something on my tongue (which burned for at least a week afterward).Thank you for your input.",

    "question": "Lately I have been having fingers in my left hand warm, tingly, achy. The only thing I could think of was that I was at a massage salon and was given a hot damp towel, but I didn't really use it, I just used my hand to put it down (it was too hot).Could I have gotten some kind of infection from handling that towel - which translated to joint pain in the finger?",
