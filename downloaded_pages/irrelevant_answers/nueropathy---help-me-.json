            "answer": "Hello,the only thing that can really help diabetic neuropathy is normalization of blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Ie. getting blood sugars fasting to about 80-95 range and post eating always less than 140.If you could achieve this with meds and diet, then it will take about 6 - 18 months, but the neuropathy can be reversed.I recommend reading the book Diabetes Solutions by Dr. Richard Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0IF you can follow his advice exactly and gain blood sugar control, your situation may be able to improve your situation.",

    "question": "I have diabetic nueropathy i take the highest dose of lyrica (gabbapentin didnt work) i also take oxycodone (60mg a day) and fentanyl (75mg patch every 3 days) and get very little relief. Im bed ridden and can barely stand 4 a few seconds. The burning, electricity crackles and bee stinging is so bad at times i wish i could chop my feet off. It began in the tips of my toes 3 yrs ago and has now spread up my shins and calves. My feet feel like they r encased in wet concrete i can barely bend them they r numb yet they burn as if on fire. Ive tried creams,pills,ice water,magic potions (seriously) i was told theres sum compound cream but it costs a grand for a 3 month supply.\u00a0\u00a0Ive fought for 3 yrs to get anyone to help me, everyone keeps sayin they cant help me. Is there anything that can help ?",
