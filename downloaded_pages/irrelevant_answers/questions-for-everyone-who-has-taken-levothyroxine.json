            "answer": "Dear DAC - miss you a bunch hun!!!Here is my deal. Swelling: Yep -- I have that as you know. Ocassionally I get that rig bulge but for about a month I have seen some change. I don't seem to fight as much to sit up straight evvery day any more. I never took any meds for the water retention (which this is what I think it is)The stomach pain I had was there and since I started a daily routine of acidophillus - that has seemed to go away. It also solved my IBS and acid too. and maybe some of the bloating went away with that too. ...... not sure.I think Lithium antidepressants with thyroid meds are the bad ones together. I don't know if benzo's are connected yet with that.WHen I switched from Synthroid to Armour - I noticed better results. I felt energy wise better - The brain fog lifted alot - but I still get it. I lately have been thinking to try Thyrolar instead of Armour. Just to see if I get the altimate results I still am looking for.I was checking on endo disorders coming in three's when we talked- It's amazing on what I read -I this nodule for me didn't come up - I would totally be doing more searches on getting myself balanced.Miss you Dac. We'll connect soon!! :)",

            "answer": "My endo says he doesn;t believe there us a connection to anti-d's and thyroid disease. Obviously- Lithium, but with the SSRI's\u00a0\u00a0he hasn't seen a link. He is a Top Doc and I do trust him.I asked him last week if when I am weaned off Lexapro (which i am currently in the process of) would I need a dose change. He said no. I mentioned that Zoloft is connected with either causing hypo or requiring an increased levo dose. This is when he said he has personally seen no link in his experience.The benzo's are anti-anxiety meds, not antidepressants. I have never seen in the literature a warning about them and levo.Hope some of this is helpful!",

            "answer": "There's nothing about the ADs causing thyroid problems.\u00a0\u00a0It says that Levothyroxine--only one listed--is not suppose to be taken with AD's.\u00a0\u00a0I'm on big time amount of Celexa for my depression and also anxiety, but it states that the levo can make the anxiety worse if taken with AD's.Have done a lot of research into this.\u00a0\u00a0The entire lithium/thyroid med issue is a real mess when you read it.\u00a0\u00a0Lithium destroys thyroid tissue, but they don't want you taking the 2 together.\u00a0\u00a0HUH?\u00a0\u00a0Crazy.The swelling. . .it is an expected symptom of being hypo, but not when my levels are really good.\u00a0\u00a0My drs don't even know at this point what is causing it.\u00a0\u00a0There is nothing medically wrong with me to make me swell now.\u00a0\u00a0And I don't eat a lot of salt so that's not it.\u00a0\u00a0Have read lots and lots of stuff now about the swelling being one of the bad side affects of levo.Should have stated this earlier.\u00a0\u00a0They don't think it is the thyroid hormone itself that has the bad side affects.\u00a0\u00a0Levothyroxine has a lot of supposed \"inactive\" ingredients that they think is the culprit with it.\u00a0\u00a0The others don't have the same ones and it's the most different from all the synthetic thryoid meds.Also have to consider my diabetes and wether or not it was really caused by the levo and if I would do much better on something natural.\u00a0\u00a0That's a big factor in al this.Thanks for the input.\u00a0\u00a0Always appreciate all the help I get on here.Dac",

            "answer": "So are you saying that the generic levothyroxine is listed as contraindicated with AD's?I have never heard about the generic being so different, except that it's amount of active ingredient that can vary.I may be off the mark about your swelling with this next tidbit. But, I take magnesium for PMS type fluid retention. I forgot to take it much last month and oh, did I pay for it with bloating. I had to squeeze myself into my jeans- yuck!What is it about levo causing diabetes? Do you have any references? I would like to bring this up with my endo. He thinks I may have Schmidt's Syndrome (PAS, type 2) b/c of autoimmune hypo and possible adrenal insufficiency. PAS-2 often includes diabetes, so I would like to have a heads up about this possibility, especially if I am predisposed to it.Thanks for your info as well.Kitty",
