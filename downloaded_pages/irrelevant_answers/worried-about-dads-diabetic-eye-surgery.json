            "answer": "The eye surgery your father is going to go through is relatively very successful. But i'm not sure of any web sites that have the information you requested. i tend to rely on books instead of the web for information. The ADA has many books for sale and the NIH (National Institute of Health) has many pamphlets of various diabetic issues. This can be accessed through the web. Hope this helps, bret.",

            "answer": "For diabetes eye stuff-astralagus or Huong Chi (Chinese for Astralagus) is great. I stopped taking it a bit ago and now-oh no!! See www.bluepoppy.com for info on that. Ebselen along with lutein is supposed to be good. I may have enough money left for Ebselen, but I'm not sure about Nepretin-sounds very good though. I didn't reach the point to get shark's cartrilidge, but I know that would help. 35.5 years taking insulin and I'd have to say I have a bunch of Angels watching over me! I now watch TBN amap since I was raised by non-practicing Catholics. Oh, Dr. Richard K. Bernstein is a must-taking insulin over 50 years!",
