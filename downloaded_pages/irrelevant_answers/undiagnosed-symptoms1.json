            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!What you have is probably postural hypotension. The blood pressure falls when you stand and causes all the symptoms that you are suffering. Dehydration, certain medications, heart problems, untreated diabetes, and nervous system disorders can all cause this. TIAs or transient ischemic attacks can also be the cause. Certain epilepsies too behave this way with temporary blackouts. Certain internal ear problems can also affect blood pressure monitoring by the body by not properly signaling a change in position. Blood pressure monitoring, tilt table test, EKG, heart echo, ambulatory blood pressure recording are all required for diagnosis.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

    "question": "Since I was about 10 years old I have been having these fainting spells. I never have them sitting down just when I am standing. I feel a pressure in my head, then my vision goes black, I hear a roaring in my ears, and they last for only seconds. When I come back I am slightly confused for a second then my head hurts a little, my heart is pounding, I sometimes have coldsweats, and my breathing is faster. I am\u00a0\u00a024 years old and in the last couple years they have been getting a little worse. I'm 4'10\" and about 110 lbs max. I sleep ok, don't really drink but maybe once or twice a week with a beer or two, I recently stopped exercising but had been exercising everyday for the past 3 years. I've started to have little spells sitting down now and i'm concerned about what it is. I've been to the doctor a couple times and got diagnosed with syncope and was told it would go away in my early 20s. My grandmother has something to do with high potassium with similiar symptoms. What is wrong with me?",
