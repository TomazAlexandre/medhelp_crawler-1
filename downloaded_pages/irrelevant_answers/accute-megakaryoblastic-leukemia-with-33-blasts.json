            "answer": "Dear Cbabum,The decision of whether or not to pursue aggressive therapy is always a difficult one.\u00a0\u00a0It is especially difficult for patients who are in your father\u2019s age range \u2013 because there is much higher risk involved with the therapy.For AML, there are several risk factors that are important in determining the likely outcome of the disease.\u00a0\u00a0These can include age, functional capacity (how active a patient is at baseline), cytogenetic abnormalities (chromosome abnormalities found in the leukemia cells), and whether or not a patient had an underlying bone marrow problem from which the leukemia progressed.\u00a0\u00a0Age in and of itself would not be factor for determining treatment.You mentioned that your father has a history of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Does he have any other medical problems (complications from his diabetes, high blood pressure, heart disease)?\u00a0\u00a0Does he exercise regularly?\u00a0\u00a0Is he active and fit for his age?\u00a0\u00a0For patients who are in his age range and are medically fit, aggressive therapy can be a reasonable treatment option.\u201cAggressive therapy\u201d typically implies intensive chemotherapy with a long hospitalization (anywhere from 4-6 weeks).\u00a0\u00a0Many complications can occur during this hospitalization (infection, bleeding, organ dysfunction).\u00a0\u00a0Your father would be monitored closely.\u00a0\u00a0You must know going into it that the risks are there and they are not small \u2013 there is a risk of dying during the hospitalization.\u00a0\u00a0You must also know that aggressive therapy does not guarantee a complete remission or that your father will be able to remain in a complete remission.\u00a0\u00a0But it is the treatment option most likely to result in a complete remission and improved supportive care measures (better anti-nausea medications, better antibiotic therapy, etc) have made it more tolerable for all patients.Other treatment options include \u201cintermediate therapy\u201d which is outpatient therapy, and \u201cbest supportive care\u201d which entails measures that are based on providing comfort to the patient.Many centers also have clinical trials available for older patients with AML and I would advise you to ask your father\u2019s leukemia doctor about this as well.I cannot tell you what would be the best decision for your father.\u00a0\u00a0It is a discussion that he and your family would need to have together. It is a decision based on your father\u2019s wishes and his goals for the care. You should discuss further with his leukemia doctor.Good luck.",
