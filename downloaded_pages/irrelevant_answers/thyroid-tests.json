            "answer": "What a bummer to have Lab mix ups. I bet you were relieved and thought you were home safe. You must be every irritated, I know I would be.Thyroid ultrasound can tell what type of nodule but it cant tell if cancer butUultrasound measure the size of the lobes of the thyroid gland. Thyroid nodules can located, measured, and examined to determine if they are solid or cysts filled with fluid. The shape and contour of each lobe can be outlined to see if it extends downward into the chest or towards the swallowing tube (esophagus) or windpipe (trachea).\u00a0\u00a0it does not provide direct information about gland function. It can tell if the thyroid gland is enlarged, but can't tell whether the enlargement is due to overactivity or underactivity. Ultrasound cannot reliably distinguish between benign (not cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) thyroid nodules. However, certain features of a nodule, such as being a small simple cyst, may increase the chance of it being benign, whereas other findings, such as extension beyond the capsule around the thyroid gland, suggest malignancy.Thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy is the only non-surgical method which can differentiate malignant and benign nodules in most, but not all cases.An open biopsy is more evasive, done by making a surgical incision through the skin to expose the thyroid gland.\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors prefer FNA. However in some case both its best to have both done because FNA is not a 100%.\u00a0\u00a0Plus with an open biopsy, they can check for cancer or do the biopsy while you are still out on the operating table.\u00a0\u00a0If cancer is found, doctor will go ahead and operate or take the cancer or thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0This save having to hover two surgeries.It is always best, better safe than sorry, to have all nodules checked for cancer, even the smallest have been known to have cancer.Good Luck!",

            "answer": "Thank You so much for all the info. My Endo appears to be for Diabetes only. What makes me so skeptic about him is that he first gave me a diagnosis of someone else. I was really blown out of my mind because I had not even done an US then. Now when I did, he didnt even apologize. He sent me to a Gyno , too. COuld this be some kind of deal, as in the more patients I send U. the better?",

    "question": "Hi iam hoping that someone can shed some light on this. I just had a thyroid ultra sound because iam a T1 diabetic and i have been missing my period for eight months. This endo first gave me somebody elses results now he gave me mine. My report shows i have a small nodule with these details \"No descreate solid or cystic nodule is present in either thyroid lobe\". He insists on a biopsy. Any and all information, you can share will be greatly apreciated.",
