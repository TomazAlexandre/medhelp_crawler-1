            "answer": "Yes, it can be, especially if it is caused by a poor diet and lack of exercise. I would avoid all sugar, exercise daily, and eat healthy foods, I think you will find this problem resolved if you do these things. Oh, also add the mineral \"Chromium\" to your diet, this is the blood sugar regulator and also a good \"B\" vitamin, food grade. Please keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello.\u00a0\u00a0Well, there are two types of Diabetes, I and II.\u00a0\u00a0Type I requires taking insulin because the pancreas for what ever reason does not produce it.\u00a0\u00a0Patients diagnosed with this one are usually under the age of 40.\u00a0\u00a0Type II may require insulin and/or oral medications but the pancreas produces insulin but not enough.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes this type can be controlled with diet. Type II is strongly linked with obesity and people over the age of 40.\u00a0\u00a0There are some studies and documentation that patients diagnosed with Type II decreased their body fat/weight with exercise and diet have reversed their Diabetes, not needing medications anymore and their blood sugars become normal again.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise is one of the best ways to stimulate a sluggish pancreas to produce more insulin combined with a diet low in carbohydrates.Always, always follow-up with your physician for recommendations tailored for youbefore taking any over the counter medications and supplements promising to stabilize blood sugar.Hope this was easy to understand.Good luck!",

            "answer": "Good-ole walking is the best exercise there is, a good, brisk 45 minute walk a day is what most health care professionals recommend.As to diet, cut out all sugars, junk food and add more veggies, they are a must. Also, eat more protein like lean beef, chicken, tuna, and turkey, this will help keep the blood sugar stable and aid in the weight loss too.",
