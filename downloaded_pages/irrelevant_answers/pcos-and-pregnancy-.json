    "question": "From the time i started menstruating my periods have been irregular. It started of slowly and then gradually increased. I stopped seeing my period for a month and next month it came. Then happened that two months passed and there was no period. Then I would menstruate. It went on like this until now I miss up to six months. For as long as I could remember I have visited Doctors for this problem. They usually gave me birth control pills to try to regulate my periods stating that my hormones were imbalanced. One of the doctors gave me diagnosis of PCOS. When I did a scan it showed that the diagnosis was true but showed that case was very mild. Even before the diagnosis I became pregnant but I had a miscarriage at 7 weeks. However, at the ending of last year I thought that everything was coming back to normal because I started to see my period regularly until March of this year. The cycle was on point. Here comes April and I am waiting for my period to come but it did not. I immediately thought that I was pregnant. I went on to take two pregnancy test which were negative. We are currently in July and to this day have not seen my period as of yet. I have no cravings but i do feel tired and sleep a lot and also urinate a lot. Could I be pregnant? Or is this just the PCOS acting up? How can I get pregnant with this diagnosis? What are some drugs that help me to get pregnant? Is there any hope that I can have children?",
