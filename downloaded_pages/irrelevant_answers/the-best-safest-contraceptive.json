            "answer": "A number of studies have shown that oral contraceptives seem to increase the risk of kidney disease in type 1 diabetic women. See the website listed below:http://www.diabetes.org/diabetes-research/summaries/ahmed-birth-control.jspThere are other contraceptive methods available: IUDs or diaphragms won't have any effect\u00a0\u00a0on glucose levels or other health issues. Nor will condoms. There is more information about which types of IUDs seem to be better for diabetic women at the following site:http://thewelltimedperiod.blogspot.com/2005/05/type-1-diabetes-and-iud.html",

            "answer": "Hallo,try the ring,it is something great, has lots of advantages and not as many (or practically no) side effects on the diabetes in comparison to the other contraceptives. You need to think only twice a month about it, you do not feel it at all and I think it is the best contraceptive discovered until now.I use it for about 5-6 Months and have Diabetes type 1 for 13 yrs. It is also said to be as safe as the pills. Just ask your doctor or search for information in the web.good luck",

    "question": "Hello Doctor,I am a young adult female. I have had Juenile diabetes for about 13 years now and lead as I would describe a normal life. It was difficult at first to regulate my glucose and other effects but evenutally I was able to control the disease- my glucose levels, eating on time and medicine intake. However, I was diagnosed with hypertension recently and on medication for it. As I got older, my symptoms changed as well, whether it was signs of low or high gluscose, energy levels etc. I plan on discussing this with my doctor. However, what I was really interested in is, as a type 1 diabetic, what is the best choice for contraception. I dont want to create new issues with my disease but I want to transition into a new stage in my life. (p.s I am not planning on becoming pregnant right now.) Can you help?",
