            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!To treat ejaculatory dysfunction you have to find the cause. If it is anxiety driven, then yes, an anti-anxiety medication may help. Usually premature ejaculation (you ejaculate before you want to) is due to anxiety to perform. It could also be due to building up of sexual tension and arousal happening too fast. You should discuss this with your partner and both of you should pace yourself. However if there is a problem in maintaining erection too, then there may be some other problem too like use of drugs, diabetes, low testosterone, varicoceles, neurological or vascular problems (peripheral vascular disease, heart or thyroid conditions) etc. You would then need to consult an urologist or sex therapist for this. Take care!",
