            "answer": "I dnt have gestational I have pre existing diabetes. Best advice I can tell you is educate yourself. Very important.\u00a0\u00a0The medications they give you are as safe as they can get for the situation. It's safer then having out of control blood sugar which damages your babies organs and possibly yours. Diet and exercise really helps but try to stay off meds as long as possible. Have diabetes before pregnancy I had no other choice but to go on insulin. Insulin is safe as well but it is dangerous if your not educate on it. Good luck hope for the best.",
