            "answer": "Hi, your lips may not be responding to the everyday lip balm and may need a prescription strength moisturizer. But try this...before bed try using Vaseline on your lips to help aid them during night and if possible use it during the day as needed. Continue drinking plenty of water and be sure to take a multivitamin everyday, if the problem persists try consulting with a dermatologist. With the burning sensation, it does sound like possibly too much sun exposure? I would refrain from wearing any makeup on your lips to see if it provides any relief. If your a smoker this may also have an effect on your body. Keep me posted!",

    "question": "So for the past 3 months or so, my lips have been so dry I am putting on lip balm or carmexor something literally every half hour.\u00a0\u00a0They aren't chapped, but they are just dry all the time.And sometimes they are really hurting!\u00a0\u00a0It feels like I have hot sauce on them, or a sunburn.I am going thru \"the change\", but the rest of my skin isn't drier than normal.\u00a0\u00a0I drinkplenty of water, and very little caffeine (no coffee, and only occasional iced tea.\u00a0\u00a0No soft drinks.) I know excessive thirst can be a sign of diabetes, but I'mnot thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0And I'm not taking any prescription meds other than Ambien, but the lip drynessstarted before I went on it.\u00a0\u00a0And my lips are redder than normal.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like maybe I have an allergy tosomething, but I have no idea what, and I don't wear the same lipstick every day.",
