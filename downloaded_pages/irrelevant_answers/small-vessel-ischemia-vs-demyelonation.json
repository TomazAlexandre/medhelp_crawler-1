            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.I would suggest you to get your BP checked. The small vessel ischemic changes can occur due to hypertension, diabetes or atherosclerosis. Stroke can also cause headaches.Please get yourself screened for risk factors for stroke like high cholesterol, and high BP.If it were a brain tumor it would have come out in CT scan or MRI.Hope this helps!",
