            "answer": "I have the same condition. Mine is mostly below the knees and nothing on the toes. I thought it was from wearing slacks all the time or my diabetes. Someone said the other day that she had heard that if you don't have hair on your toes, you have poor circulation. I haven't been to the doctor lately so haven't had a chance to ask.",

    "question": "I hope this isn't the wrong forum, but I have no idea where to look for info.I'm a 57 year old woman,\u00a0\u00a05'7\" & about 135 lbs. and in ok health.\u00a0\u00a0The last time I shaved my legs (a month ago) was the last I've had of any hair on my legs.....even the parts I don't shave....my toes and upper thighs.\u00a0\u00a0The only other noticeable symptom related to my legs going bald is all of my skin seems to have gotten extremely dry.Has anyone experienced or heard of anything like this?\u00a0\u00a0 Having no hair on my legs would have been great 30 years ago, but now it just seems so sudden and so strange.\u00a0\u00a0Any info would be greatly appreciated!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks, Terri",
