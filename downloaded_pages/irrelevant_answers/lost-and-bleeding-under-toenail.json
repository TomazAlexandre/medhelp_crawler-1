            "answer": "Adopt a low carb, moderate protein and high fat (healthy fats like olive oil, avocado, grass fed butter, coconut oil, etc) diet.\u00a0\u00a0Thus will stabilize your blood sugar, making your diabetes more manageable, and help reduce inflammation in your body.\u00a0\u00a0You will also enjoy eating this way because the foods you were likely told not to eat (like bacon and whipped cream) are on the good list.\u00a0\u00a0To do this, eliminate all grains from your diet, like rice, bread, pasta, flour, and high starchy stuff, like beans.\u00a0\u00a0Eat meals containing non starch veg with meat/fish/eggs,and don't be shy with fats (from healthy sources).\u00a0\u00a0Choose only natural fats (like butter, coconut oil, avocado, etc) and stay away from fake fats, like margarine.\u00a0\u00a0Opt for high omega 3 containing fats (salmon, olive, nuts, avocado, flax) while not high omega 6 oils (grape seed, canola, sunflower).\u00a0\u00a0Eat non starchy veg frequently, and limit fruits (because they are full if sugar) to rare occasional treats (like once a month).\u00a0\u00a0Stay away from all sugars (white table sugar, honey, agave, fruit juice, etc).\u00a0\u00a0Have as much non starch veg, meat and healthy fats as you want in each meal.\u00a0\u00a0Eat whole foods, and stay away from processed foods.\u00a0\u00a0Eat full fat cheeses and yogurts, and stay away from low or no fat stuff.\u00a0\u00a0Especially stay away from low or no fat yogurt (it has same effect as candy in your body).\u00a0\u00a0With this way of eating, you will stabilize your blood sugar (needed for diabetic condition) and it will reduce inflammation in your body.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "While that type of diet will surely help to lower her sugar level, it will ultimately lead to cardiac arrest!\u00a0\u00a0High fat diets in the diabetic is never a good thing because they are at higher risk for cardiovascular disease anyhow!\u00a0\u00a0Low fat and low cholesterol diets are needed for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0If they are brittle diabetics, protein is needed for the lows, but moderation in everything is the way to go!",

            "answer": "Make an appointment to see your doctor urgently so that he can refer you to a podiatrist or make an appointment to see a podiatrist yourself.With being a diabetic any problems with the feet and also with any wounds that do not heal properly need urgent medical attention.Through the diabetes, it is highly likely that you already have nerve damage, and the feet are usually the first to feel the nerve damage by feeling numb or sensations of pins and needles.\u00a0\u00a0When this happens, you loose normal sensitivity and will not be able to feel any damage that may occur.\u00a0\u00a0It is very important that you get this medically examined and dealt with because infections can set in with a possibility of any wound getting septic leading to gangrene and possible amputation.\u00a0\u00a0And this is what you want to avoid.With regard to your weight ask the doctor to refer you to a dietician to help you with regard to eating healthily and portion sizes.Fruttibiscotti has some good advice with regard to healthy foods to eat and the healthy types of fat that our body needs to stay healthy.\u00a0\u00a0 But unfortunately being a diabetic, you cannot eat as much as you want and stuff yourself silly.\u00a0\u00a0This is where the dietician will help you.\u00a0\u00a0Personally, I was doing fine before the holidays and now have to seriously get back on track.Even before you get to see a dietician, you can help yourself by eating healthy foods (avoiding all processed and sugary foods, fizzy drinks, you can still have some, but small amounts occasionally).\u00a0\u00a0Even fresh fruit juices need to be portioned.\u00a0\u00a0 Choose brown seeded bread instead of white bread.\u00a0\u00a0Choose breakfast cereals that contain no sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Wheetabix, Shredded Wheat and plain porridge are all good choices.\u00a0\u00a0You can make your own porridge on milk or with water and add fruit or cinnamon (no sugar).\u00a0\u00a0Choose a natural Greek set yogurt and add your own fruit to it rather than buying the fruit yogurts - even the low fat ones contain too much sugar.You may be able to find a diet diary on the web that you can print off and write down everything that you eat and drink.\u00a0\u00a0It is better to eat smaller portions spread out throughout the day, rather than eat 3 large meals.\u00a0\u00a0Eat healthy snacks in between your main meals.\u00a0\u00a0Healthy snacks are: vegetables, nuts, fruit, egg,\u00a0\u00a0(if you eat bananas only eat a small one).Having a healthy diet will not only help with your sugar control, but will also help you to lose weight and also may help with regard to any inflammation that you have with your arthritis.\u00a0\u00a0Although losing weight will not cure any damaged bones, losing weight will help by relieving the stress on the weight bearing joints (hips, knees, feet).If you are able to walk and move about, go for a walk a couple of times a day.\u00a0\u00a0Start of by doing a few minutes and gradually build up the length of your walk and pace as your health starts to improve.\u00a0\u00a0If you are not able to walk, do some type of gentle exercises at home.\u00a0\u00a0Swimming is an excellent form of exercise and even if you cannot swim, doing exercises in the water and walking in the water to exercise your knees will also help.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor may be able to refer you to a physiotherapist or a pain management clinic that will be able to give you specific exercises for you to do and specifically for any troublesome arthritic joints.Exercise will also help with using up energy and help with the diabetes.As this is the start of the New Year, this is a good opportunity to start taking control of your own health and strive to lose weight and get healthier (with help and support from your doctor/dietician or other support groups).Wishing you all the best.Let me know how you get on.",
