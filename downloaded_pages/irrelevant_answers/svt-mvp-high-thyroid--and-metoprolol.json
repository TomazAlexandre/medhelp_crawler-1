You aren't really at risk for serious cardiac events, so it really can't decrease the risk.\u00a0\u00a0The beta blocker is intended to treat your symptoms of palpitaitons.3.\u00a0\u00a0My ejection fraction is around 60%, will the beta blocker put me at risk for and a decrease in ejection fraction?No, it will not decrease your ejection fraction.4.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a chance that when my T3 and T4T4 test are normalized, that I can stop the metoprolol?Yes.\u00a0\u00a0You should probably see an endocrine doctor about treating the thyroid problems.5.\u00a0\u00a0Without knowing the actual mechanism behind the SVTParoxysmal\u00a0\u00a0(psvt), can metoprolol actually cause more harm than good?People take beta blockers for this all the time.\u00a0\u00a0If you had WPW and got atrial fibrillation, a beta blocker could cause problems.\u00a0\u00a0But this is very rare.\u00a0\u00a0I think you are letting your anxiety about the medication get the best of you.6.\u00a0\u00a0Can SVTParoxysmal supraventricular tachycardia (psvt) be position dependent?\u00a0\u00a0This may sound dumb, but it occurs more frequently based on how I sit or how full my is.Changes in autonomic (nervous system) tone after eating can affect arrhythmias.\u00a0\u00a0It is possible that food affects the SVT.7.\u00a0\u00a0Can I still go out and enjoy an occasional drink or two?Yes, this is not a problem.",

    "question": "Hi, I am a 31 year old male with a history of GERD and mitral valve prolapse with regurrgitation.\u00a0\u00a0I should note that I've had occasional bouts of PVC's for about 10 years.\u00a0\u00a0In the last two months, it has been discovered that my free T3 and T4 levels are high (6.0pg/mL and 2.43ng/dL, respectively).\u00a0\u00a0These levels were normal 18 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0Within the last 6 to 9 months I have experienced random occurrences (couple times a month) of an accelarated heart rate which lasts from about 5 to 30 seconds (I do not get dizzy or short of breath).\u00a0\u00a0My cardiologist got the readings from an event recorder, and told me it was SVT (about 150bpm).\u00a0\u00a0Just last week, he prescribed Toprol XL 25mg bid for the SVT which I haven't started to take yet due to fears of it leading to other problems (impotence, diabetes mellitus, etc).\u00a0\u00a0Here are my questions:1.\u00a0\u00a0Am I at an increase risk of sudden cardiac death and/or V-fib from the SVT runs, especially due to the bad mitral valve?2.\u00a0\u00a0Will taking the metoprolol actually DECREASE the chance for serious cardiac events that may be caused by SVT or just relieve symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0(If there is no actual medical benefit besides symptom relief, I would rather not take the medication)3.\u00a0\u00a0My ejection fraction is around 60%, will the beta blocker put me at risk for edema and a decrease in ejection fraction?4.\u00a0\u00a0Is there a chance that when my T3 and T4 are normalized, that I can stop the metoprolol?5.\u00a0\u00a0Without knowing the actual mechanism behind the SVT, can metoprolol actually cause more harm than good?6.\u00a0\u00a0Can SVT be position dependent?\u00a0\u00a0This may sound dumb, but it occurs more frequently based on how I sit or how full my stomach is.7.\u00a0\u00a0Can I still go out and enjoy an occasional drink or two?Thanks for taking a look at my question and I appreciate any feedback that you may have.Worried in WI",
