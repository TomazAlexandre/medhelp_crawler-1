            "answer": "There are in fact, MANY things you can do; most of diabetic management is done at home, actually. Type 2 diabetes is controlled by a combination of weight loss, carb lowering and exercise as well as medications when needed. So if you are above your optimal weight, you need to work on bringing it down, and that alone will make a big difference in your blood glucose. Then you need to significantly lower the carbs you take in which is what raise blood glucose when you eat. Carbs include sweets of course, but also bread potatoes rice cereal and pasta. If you eat something and then test two hours later you will know if you can continue to eat that food or that amount of that food. Your blood glucose after two hours should be under 140. Next comes exercise. Even taking a walk will help lower your blood glucose.Finally, if you do all of the above and your numbers are still too high than it might be time to talk to your doctor about oral meds, adding to or changing your meds, or starting you on insulin.",
