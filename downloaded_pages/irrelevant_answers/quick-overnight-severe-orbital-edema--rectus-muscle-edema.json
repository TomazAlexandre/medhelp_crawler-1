            "answer": "Hasn't any doctor spoken to you about Graves or Graves eye disease? Have the doctors just been letting your thyroid grow without treating you? Get to a good endocrinologist.Have they tested your TSI antibodies to determine Graves?What are 'slightly high' labs? The standards for diagnosing and treating thyroid disease are changing, but many hospitals still go by the old standards. I would not trust a regular doctor or ER doctors to your care.See list below for recommended endocrinologists. Make sure the endo specializes in thyroid, not just diabetes:http://www.thyroid-info.com/topdrs/Take care...:) Tamra",

    "question": "I just got out of the hospital r/t overnight orbitl edema increasing my eye pressure to 35 and rectus muscle to be 3 times the norm and swelled eye up where I could not open it up. I had strep throat for the first time in my life at 47 years old a week prior to this.\u00a0\u00a0Medical teams were dissagreeing as to what this was\u00a0\u00a0r/t CT scans or how it happened.\u00a0\u00a0Periorbital cellulitis? Inflammation or infection. I was treated with heavy duty ABT x 2 days but then edema continued (only in left eye) and I was awake two nights with severe headaches ( unrelieved by Morphine or Lortabs) I would contribute that to increased edema.\u00a0\u00a0 Finally one of the eye Dr's was called to evaluate me the second morning and high doses of steroids were ordered.\u00a0\u00a0In just two hours my headache was dissappearing.\u00a0\u00a0I was told I have hyperthyroidism. My labs were slightly elevated and one Dr. said it may be that way because this happened and could return to normal. I have always had an enlarged thyroid and had it checked many times before but was never told I had this problem.\u00a0\u00a0I find this very wierd r/t it only happened to one eye.\u00a0\u00a0I have been placed on Flexeril, Methocarbamol and tylenol 3 prior to this incident for and injury to Left shoulder and neck possibly a compressed nerve (pending and MRI prior to this incident).\u00a0\u00a0 I am a person who never gets sick.\u00a0\u00a0What a chain of events recently! Could my injury have anything to do with this? The medications? Anyone with answers or thoughts I would love to hear them.",
