    "question": "My 11 year old son is on steroids for asthma.\u00a0\u00a0The Dr. has ordered a CBC for him but not until September as she is concerned about diabetes. He is overweight and last week he was at my Mom's and she said he drank a lot.\u00a0\u00a0 Last night he woke with a temperature of 101.5 and is complaining that the top of his right arm hurts but I cannot see anything wrong with it and his temp is back down to normal.He had a sore very small on his leg near his knee that was filled with puss and I drained it last night.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0Should I take him in for a blood sugar test?",
