            "answer": "Hi,Oral cancer is cancer of the mouth.Oral or mouth cancer most commonly involves the tissue of the lips or the tongue. It may also occur on the floor of the mouth, cheek lining, gingiva (gums), or palate (roof of the mouth). Most oral cancers look very similar under the microscope and are called squamous cell carcinomas. These are malignant and tend to spread rapidly.Smoking and other tobacco use are associated with 70-80% of oral cancer cases. Smoke and heat from cigarettes, cigars, and pipes irritate the mucous membranes of the mouth. Use of chewing tobacco or snuff causes irritation from direct contact with the mucous membranes. Heavy alcohol use is another high-risk activity associated with oral cancer.Other risks include poor dental and oral hygiene and chronic irritation (such as that from rough teeth, dentures, or fillings). Some oral cancers begin as leukoplakia or mouth ulcers.When physicians detect oral tongue cancer at an early stage, they can often treat it with surgery or radiation. In later stages, the cancer may require a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. In most cases of a malignant tongue tumor, the abnormal tissue is classified as squamous cell carcinoma. Occasionally pathologists determine the condition to be a sarcoma, minor salivary gland carcinoma, or lymphoma.ref:http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/001035.htmMode of treatment can be decided only after the test results are in.Swelling due to procedure done will subside slowly.You could ask your doctor to prescribe pain medication and also enzymes to reduce tissue swelling.",
