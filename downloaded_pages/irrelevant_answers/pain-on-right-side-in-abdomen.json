            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Did you mean you have pain in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen? Right upper quadrant pain and white stool could indicate disorders in the liver or gall bladder. If you have jaundice then it could point towards an obstructive disorder like gall stones. The other causes for pain could be GERD (Gastro Esophageal Reflux Disease), where the acid contents of the stomach came up into the esophagus and peptic ulcer disease. Please consult your primary care physician for proper assessment and therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Its' unlikely that the liver inflammation can be due to ibuprofen. It could be due to other causes, like infections. If it is fatty liver changes, there is an entity called Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
