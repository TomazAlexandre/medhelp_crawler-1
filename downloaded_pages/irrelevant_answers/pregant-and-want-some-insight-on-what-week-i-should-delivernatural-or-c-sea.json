            "answer": "Hopefully you are under the care of an OB GYN, and they will make a plan for you that best fits your particular circumstance.\u00a0\u00a0Infants of diabetic mothers often have delayed lung maturity, so sometimes your doctor may do special tests to ensure that the baby's lung will be mature, and deliver at that time.\u00a0\u00a0Typically they are delivered at/near 38 weeks but your own doctor is the only one who can advise you in this important issue.C/S or vag delivery can also only be recommended by your own doctor.",

            "answer": "Hi, I agree with the other comments on this sight this is definitely something you should bring up to your OB/GYN. I am a diabetic and have been since 14. During my pregnanacy I delivered at 38 weeks based on a test which determined my daughters lung capacity as well as an estimation to her size. I was induced and delivered naturally based on my circumstances. But again every person is different. Honestly I am surprised your doctor has not discussed this with you yet. It is a question I recommend you raise. I'm sure all will be well and handled appropriately based on you and your babies needs. Good luck with your delviery I wish you and your baby all the best!!Carolyn",

            "answer": "Like the other two diabetic women who have posted here, I have had successful pregnancies. I had two children, and both were delivered as stated in the other comments: the doctor started doing tests to determine the babies' lung capacities at around 37 weeks in my case, and as soon as the lungs were developed adequately, labor was induced. The only reason that a C-section would be likely to happen would be if the baby got in trouble near the end of your pregnancy. It is very important that you make sure that your glucose levels are under tight control as you approach the end of the pregnancy in order to keep the placenta properly nourished. Both of my babies were healthy and so am I.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you a wonderful pregnancy and a healthy baby!",
