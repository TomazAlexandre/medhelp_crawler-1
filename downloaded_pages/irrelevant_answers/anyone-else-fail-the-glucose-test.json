I googled GD diets online, but I did not find a specific diet. I found information such as \"should keep sugar level constant throughout day\". I know what that means, but not in terms of what I should eat to achieve this. Thanks for the good wishes. I'll post the results next week after the 3 hour test.",

I am on diet right now and seems that the diet is working for me so no need for pills or insulin. as far as the diet go, you have to basically limit the intake of carbohydrates(nothing with more that 15 g of carbs). which means more mean and protein, more vegetables and less cookies and rice, etc:(((i'll give you my sample diet, maybe this helps:Breakfast: one-two toasts with cheesesnack: crackers or cottage cheese or dannon light and fit fruit yogurt and a glass of milklunch: one starch(one toast, etc), meat and vegetablessnack: small fruit( shouldnt be eating a big apple)dinner: meat and vegetables and 5-6 tbsp riceI dont have a problem keeping up with my diet, but I really crave sweets sometimes.I hope your 3 hour test turns out fine.Lily",

            "answer": "Thanks for sharing your diet Lily! 15 g of carbs sounds like so little. And I think I'm eating much more than you on your diet - at least in the afternoon and evening. I thought I was pretty good with sweets - I try not to keep them in the house. But I know it would be hard for me with the holidays coming up. I will try to modify my diet a little before the next test - and thereafter. Good luck keeping up with the diet Lily!",

A total of three times in 2 hrs LOL. Anyway, my results came back that I didnt have gestational diabetes. From what I recall my numbers were under 100.",

When I went in, they took a blood sample - baseline I guess? I drank a tall red sweet drink. And then every hour for the next 3 hours they took another vial of blood. No eating nor drinking during the 3 hours - that was the tough part. The last hour my stomach started grumbling and then right after I got home I started feeling light-headed. My 1 hour result was 134. I'm really hoping that I pass this time around. If not, I'll feel like the 3 hour test was a waste of time.\u00a0\u00a0congratulations for those who passed! Good luck Melissa (and anyone else who failed) with the 3 hour test! For those who failed both, good luck sticking to the diet. And remember you're doing it for a healthy baby!",

    "question": "Hello-I took the glucose screening test on Friday and failed. Next Tuesday I have to take the 3 hour, fasting glucose test and I'm not looking forward to it. Has anyone else failed the glucose screening test? If you failed both tests, where can I find a sample diet for those with gestational diabetes? I would like to change my diet before I take the test to see if that helps me pass. Any advice is greatly appreciated.Thanks,Shannon",
