            "answer": "Please don't get induced unless you have a medical reason. I was induced with gestational diabetes. And will not be induced this time. It is making the baby come before its ready. You haven't got long left honestly its so much better to go naturally and less painful. Being induced took three days in my case and made my contractions\u00a0\u00a0rapid and in my case very painful... There was no build up of pain they were horrible as soon as they started. Like I said if tgeres no medical reason its so much better to go.naturally. I know you're impatient I was too but it will happen soon. All the best. Hope this helped",
