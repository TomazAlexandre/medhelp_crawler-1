            "answer": "Some of your symptoms sound like some of the symptoms of hypoglycemia... You might want to try drinking a half to 1 cup of juice when this happens and see if you feel any better in about 15 minutes. Some of the symptoms of hypoglycemia are:1. headache2. sweating3. sometimes no sweating, but sudden cold chill or warm flush4. nausea5. feeling of fatigue6. inability to concentrate7. shakes -- sometimes in hands, but sometimes in any other muscles in the body8. dry mouth and/or eyes9. sometimes instead of nausea, there is a craving for food, especially foods with a high carbohydrate count10. irritability11. feeling of unexplained stress or depressionThese are only some symptoms that people notice. The symptoms can vary greatly from one episode to another, so any combination of these symptoms can be a sign of dropping blood glucose levels. Most people can get this under control if they do some dietary changes. A glucose tolerance test done by your doctor's lab can sometimes verify that a person has episodes of hypoglycemia, but sometimes the test comes back normal even if the person has very deifinate hypo symptoms",
