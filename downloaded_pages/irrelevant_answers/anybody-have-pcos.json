    "question": "I have Pcos. And we have been trying for nearly 3 Years to get pregnant. And we have finally succeeded. I was just wondering if anybody knew if this pregnancy will be any different then a normal pregnancy. I mean is it a higher risk for miscarriages? Or higher risk for problems during the pregnancy.
