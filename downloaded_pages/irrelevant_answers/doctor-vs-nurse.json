            "answer": "Hello,It is\u00a0\u00a0not correct that she cannot eat after the correction (the correction should have corrected for the high sugar),\u00a0\u00a0however, you will need to dose her insulin based on the carbs she eats for dinner.Please follow the Drs advice.Are you following a lower carb diet with your daughter?\u00a0\u00a0A high carb diet can make blood sugars very hard to control (and need lots of insulin).\u00a0\u00a0Low carb is safe for children and doesn't affect growth (it is the very\u00a0\u00a0high blood sugars that are not safe, and which restrict physical and mental development of children).If you are interested to know more about low carb and diabetes management, I can refer you to read Dr. Richard Bernstein \"Diabetes Solutions\". Available on Amazon, if it's not in your local bookstore/library.\u00a0\u00a0He is an Engineer who then studied medicine when he was in his early 40s, and specialises in diabetes care. He nearly 80 (still working) and has diabetes for about 68 years.\u00a0\u00a0His book is very information and he uses low carb dietary approach as part of his management approach, including for children.",

    "question": "We are trying to get my daughter's diabetes under control.\u00a0\u00a0She is running high, in the 300s most of the time.\u00a0\u00a0The pediatric Endo doc told us to take her level after school, at 3:30, and give her a correction of insulin if needed.\u00a0\u00a0We also take her level at dinner, 5:00 pm to 5:30, and give her insulin to cover the dinner carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Today a visiting nurse came to the house after school and when told us if we give our daughter a correction at 3:30 we cannot give her dinner at 5:00 pm but must wait\u00a0\u00a0three hours after we give the insulin.\u00a0\u00a0This is not what the doctor said.\u00a0\u00a0What should we do?",
