    "question": "Hi,I would just like to thank you in advance for having this great site available and helping me.I was kissed by my girlfriend who has HSV-1 and was unaware she had it.\u00a0\u00a0This would be the 5th night of not having any bumps/spots show up yet.\u00a0\u00a0It was not a full blown soar on her lip when we kissed but still a bump underneath the skin.\u00a0\u00a0She claims when we kissed that I never touched it.(since it's on the corner of her mouth)I've been having a headache (I never get headaches) and my jaw is sore.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure if this is because of lack of sleep i've been getting from stress or if i'm actually going to get a sore very soon.My question is:1 - Do these symptoms relate to HSV-1 although i do not feel any pain or bumps yet.2 - If i do get cold sores, will they be worse for me and am i more prone to them seeing as I have type 1 diabetesThank you so much for your help",
