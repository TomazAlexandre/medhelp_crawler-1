            "answer": "Kris, does diabetes run in your family at all? Just curious since you mention the amount of water he drinks. Excessive thirst is an early sign of juvenile diabetes; although, I'm not sure how early that can start.Otherwise, I feel for ya. Brody doesn't wake that many times, but he does wake once or twice most every night! It could be Ryan's teeth though. Brody wakes more when he is teething.",
