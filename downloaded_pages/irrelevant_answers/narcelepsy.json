            "answer": "I have narcolepsy and also experience tingling/numbness is my hands and feet. Although no study has been done (none that I found anyway) there could be a connection. If you are like me, sleeping at night does not come easily.\u00a0\u00a0The inability to fully relax and sleep may\u00a0\u00a0have something to do with the nerves running down the arms and legs to become overstimulated. That's my best guess, which seems more logical than anything my doctors have come up with. Best of luck.",
