            "answer": "I would say that no matter how hard it is to confront her it's what you're going to have to do. She is a Mom and she has been there before so hopefully she remembers how it feels. You need to sit her down and explain to her that she is really wearing you out, and right now you need to eat every couple of hours, you need a 30-60 minute lunch, and you need a couple of breaks for yourself in those hours as well. Maybe if she sees you're being serious she will think that you aren't going to be staying around to much and will straighten up her act. I realize that you can't quit your job, but if you get hospitalized because your sick from not eating, and the baby has something wrong with it then what? You will be out of work. So, right now you need to look at what is, and wht could be and fix whatever is in your control. You need to stand up for yourself and your child because it sounds like you really haven't put your foot down. Must be a VERY tough situation and sounds like she may be a little intimidating, but it's what you're going to have to do. If things don't get better start searching for a new job, and when you find one, tell her good-bye!! =)",

            "answer": "Is she paying you under the table?\u00a0\u00a0If so, I know it would mean your job, but you could report her to the tax authority.\u00a0\u00a0Even if she is doing it right by the tax man, you could report her to whomever at the state watches out for employees being taken advantage of by employers.\u00a0\u00a0(Labor bureau or something like that.)\u00a0\u00a0I concur with the other poster who points out that if you get into physical trouble and have to be hospitalized, you aren't going to be able to be on the job anyway.",

            "answer": "Does she work at home and around while your watching the kids? How does she know if you are sitting down while watching the kids and taking a break? How old are the kids?Can't you eat when you feed the kids?I have been a nanny several times and never had a problem with sitting down and eating when the kids eat. By law you are required a break no matter what kind of job it is. You need to contact your local Labor and Industry and find out what the laws are exactly for that type of job.YOU and YOUR child are your FIRST responsibility!\u00a0\u00a0You may ask her \"If I don't take care of myself then how do you expect me to take care of your children?\"\u00a0\u00a0Having diabetes means you need to check your blood sugar levels and eat accordingly. Maybe instead of having your Dr write a note that you can only work so many hours He/She can write a limitation to what you need to do during your shift. Like taking a break every so often and checking your blood sugars on a schedule. If your Dr is not willing to do this and look out for you and your unborn child in my opinion they aren't a good Dr. Yes working is good for you but when your put into a situation that is not healthy then it needs to be addressed. Maybe you can try explaining it better to your Dr.",

    "question": "i need some advice on what to do about my job. i am a nanny to two kids with a mother that feels that her family should come before me.\u00a0\u00a0i am having touble because it seems that ever since i told her i was going to have a baby she has changed and has been giving me more and more work to do. right now i am 22 wks. at wk 13 i was told that i have gestational diabetes. now at work i am not giving time to eat or even sit down for 5 minutes. after i had my first fainting spell she was concerned for all about a wk. now its like she does not make sure i eat and if i try to she gives me an attitude because i am not keeping an eye on the children who ate 8 and 10. i had a 2nd faiting spell 2 wks ago because she had me work late and all i hate was some vegeatables and when i left i basically got home and passed out. of course she blaimed me for not eatting which upset me so i dropped my hours from 30 to 25. now she is begging me to go back to 30 hours and i told her i would but i can not work more than 6 hours a day which is now upsetting her again. now she is demanding a note from my dr about what my limitaions are and my dr will not write me a note because she says it is good for me to work.i am currently writting my own letter. i understand that but my boss is killing me. for the last month i have been so stressed out that i am worried about the baby and the only support i am getting is from my husband. i am unable to quit because we can not afford to have me stay home. i am basically stuck between a rock and a hard place. if anyone can help that will be great i am sick and tired of crying every night worrying about this.",
