            "answer": "hello srikanthz,Bones getting weaker = Osteoporosis.That's a common problem for indian women. Esp when they were in heavy profession before. Osteoporosis chances are more if she had menopause earlier or some uterus removal operation.Still she requires about 1.5 grams of calcium daily to maintain her bone strength, lifelong, which people of india rarely take seriously.Burning sensation in foot, below knee, appears to be due to diabetic neuropathy or ever peripheral neuropathy.Find her diabetic status.i would advice you -1) Calcium tablets with total 1500mg daily intake,2) Tb Renerve plus daily OD.3) Some local anti-inflamatories for controll of pain.You can ask more questions,regardsabhijeet",

            "answer": "Hi Abhijeet,First of all thank you for quick reply. I have just found out that my mother is already taking calcium tablets. She said periods have stopped nearly 12 years ago and she never had any operation of uterus. She doesn't have diabetes either. I don't understand your second advice. Can you make it a little more clearer? I would like to know whether we can cure this completely? What could be the possible reasons for this burning sensation? I would also appreciate any further suggestions.Thanks a million!!Srikanth",

    "question": "Hi,I am writing a problem that my mother has been suffering for nearly 2 yrs now. But she has other pain problems for many years now. Now in the last 2 yrs she got some burning sensation in her legs. She has burning sensation in her legs starting from the knees to lower legs. She has been to some of the best of the orthopedic doctors in my region. They never seem to point out the exact problem, the common answers were age, bones getting weaker etc.. She has been on various medications including ayurvedic but none of these worked for her. My mother can neither sleep at nights nor she can sit pleasantly in the day. She is extremely frustrated and so disappointed that sometimes she doesn't want to live anymore. I am very worried about her as I am abroad for studies.Some of the details about her:Age: 50 yrsProfession: Retired, but has worked as a labor for 35 yrs.ThanksSrikanth",
