            "answer": "I am 39 I got pregnant unintentionally after getting into really good shape and losing 50 lbs. I started taking vitamins like Women's One a day, a b comlex and a protien shake meal replacement (Isopure). Within a month of my weight stabalizing, I became pregnant. Mind you I have a history of PECOS, Diabetes, and generally questionable health. I say all of this to say, I believe odds increase the healthier are and more balanced with vitamins. I would engage your ob immediately pre pregnancy to walk through family history, medical challenges, expectations, and risk. I am not sure the age of your partner,\u00a0\u00a0but there seems to be some addional risks to consider and baby impact with the age of dad. Look at the whole picture and make your decision on what is best for you.",

My mom got pregnant at 38 unintentionally thinking she could no longer get pregnant. She had my little sister at 39 and she has autism, sensory issues, and has had a hard time growing physically at a normal pace. Talk to your doctor and see what they recommend because all women are different.",

Doctor said because of my age I was high risk ... For downs ... Trisomy 21 .... The test came back a week later ... She called me in for an early appointment ... I was so excited because the harmony test is ... My blood taken ... And babies DNA extracted from my blood ... I was going to find out the sex .... She explained my results ... DNA showed the xtra chromosome... Trisomy 21 ... She said my baby has downs ... I cried ... Was drepressed ...prayed ... And have done way to much googling....

            "answer": "@gamma...beautifully put!!! I'm pregnant with #3 and although only 34, I am very high risk for a number of reasons, but decided not to get the tests done because my mom had an unplanned pregnancy 10yrs after having me (and I was youngest of 3). My little brother has down syndrome and I absolutely adore him!!! I didn't want to know because it's added stress during the pregnancy based on possibility....I love my baby no matter how he arrives!!@brown...if you want a baby, I agree with the other ladies to involve your dr right away and go for it! If it's meant to be, it'll happen!!",
