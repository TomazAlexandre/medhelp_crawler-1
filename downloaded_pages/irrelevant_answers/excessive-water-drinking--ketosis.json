            "answer": "I agree that is totally not normal, yet when I tell the pediatrician about it (we've been to 2) they seem completely unconcerned.\u00a0\u00a0Thats the second time we've had a slightly higher than normal blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0We have tested her after fasting and didnt see anything abnormal.\u00a0\u00a0My cousin (diabetic) tells me there is sometimes a \"honeymoon\" phase with small children where they sometimes show signs of diabetes followed by periods of no symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Im wondering if this isn't \"pre-diabetes\".Thanks for your help!Callie",

    "question": "About 4 months ago we began to notice that our 2 year old was drinking a lot of water.\u00a0\u00a0I was getting up 3-12 times a night to refill and give her more water.\u00a0\u00a0I gave it a little time thinking it had something to do with her teething (2 year molars).\u00a0\u00a0After a while, I mentioned it to our pediatrician at her 2 year checkup.\u00a0\u00a0She didnt seem worried about it, but it progressed to the point where I was getting her water all day long and then all night long.\u00a0\u00a0I took her in and they tested her urine for sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Instead of finding any sugar, they found a high level of Ketones, which they claimed they should only see if she were sick and dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0We've done blood tests, an MRI looking for Diabetes Insipidus, and are scheduled for a Nephrologist next month.\u00a0\u00a0My biggest concern (aside from the water intake) is the occasional Ketosis she's experiencing.\u00a0\u00a0She has the acetone breath, ketones in her urine and very slightly elevated blood sugar (168 after a breakfast of yogurt).\u00a0\u00a0She recently went through a two week period with just normal water intake followed by a day of very high water intake 60-70 oz. during the day.\u00a0\u00a0The next day, she was in Ketosis, with acetone breath and ketones in her urine again.\u00a0\u00a0Our pediatrician has not taken this seriously, going so far as to say \"thats just the way she is\".\u00a0\u00a0I am NOT satisfied with that answer and my Ped is fired.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had any experience with this issue?\u00a0\u00a0They pretty much flatly ruled out Diabetes Mellitus because of lack of sugar in her urine in one urine test.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not willing to rule it out just yet and think they jumped the gun in ruling it out.Any help would be greatly appreciated!Callie",
