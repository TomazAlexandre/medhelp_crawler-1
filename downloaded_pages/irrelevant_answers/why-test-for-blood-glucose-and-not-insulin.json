            "answer": "Well people get other health issues as they get older, that might make it harder for them to start an exercise program.But also seems like if blood glucose is the standard test, by the time a problem is detected some damage is already done. Some of the insulin producing cells have stopped functioning forever. Even with the lifestyle change you will not get them back to 100%.Wouldn't it be better to diagnose before this happens?",

            "answer": "That would require testing every one for c-peptide. there is no test for insulin however when the pancreas makes insulin it is attached to a c-peptide that gets stripped off later. so the test is for c-peptides. an expensive test to give to millions of people that have no problem and will develop no problem.\u00a0\u00a0and will have to be repeated every couple of years.",

            "answer": "Then I am missing something. According to all the articles initially when your insulin resistance rises you body overcompensates by producing more insulin, so wouldn't that be a good point to start diagnosing?",

            "answer": "We are not talking about some rare disease here that affects 1 in 1000.According to statistics 90 million are diagnosed with per-diabetes in the US, thats almost 1 in 4. And I bet if you look at 45+ age group the ratio is probably much worse.So given the statistics I find it suprizing that no efforts are made towards earlier diagnosis.",
