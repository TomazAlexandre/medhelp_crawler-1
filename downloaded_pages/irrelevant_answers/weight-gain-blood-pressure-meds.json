            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Apart from the medication, weight gain can be due to several causes. Also BP can rise up due to many causes. You would need to run tests like kidney function, liver function, lipid profile, thyroid, adrenal gland function, heart problems etc. You would need to eat healthy, exercise regularly as advised by cardiologist, maintain cholesterol and lipids under control.Common causes like overeating, lack of exercise, diabetes, hypothyroidism have to be ruled out in your case. You must then look for other causes. One is water retention due to low serum protein. This along with anemia can cause unexplained weight gain. Adrenal gland problems are the other cause. Cushing\u2019s syndrome should be looked for. The kidney function too should be assessed. Late night snacking and poor sleep too can cause weight gain.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
