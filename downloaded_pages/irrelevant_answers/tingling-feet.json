    "question": "I h ave had tingly in my feet for about 1'1/2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried to get help but nothing seems to come of it. My feet are quite tender on the bottom, especially the left foot. Sitting down and sleeping seem to make it worse.\u00a0\u00a0During the day I don't notice it as much when I'm moving around.\u00a0\u00a0I have cramping in my feet a lot and slightly leg on the outer left calf but only on occasion and more on the left.\u00a0\u00a0No real pain.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I have tingling between my legs on my inner thighs.\u00a0\u00a0I did have a hysterectomy and ovaries removed one year ago, but the tingling was around before that.\u00a0\u00a0The removal was for fibroids and an ovarian cyct, nothing sinister. I am not overweight. I have had an x-ray of the lumbar spine, which was apparently normal.\u00a0\u00a0I have had physiotherapy and the therpist said my pelvis was twisted and she straightened it.\u00a0\u00a0At first it seemed better, but not it seems worse. I have tried two treatments of acupuncture.\u00a0\u00a0The first treatment worked a bit and my tingling seemed to get better, but on the second treatment, it seemed worse.\u00a0\u00a0Help!\u00a0\u00a0I'm getting paranoid, I can't sleep, it's affecting my life, my marriage, my sanity.",
