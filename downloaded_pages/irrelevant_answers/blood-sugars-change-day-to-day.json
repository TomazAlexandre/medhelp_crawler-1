How has the pregnancy been thus far? How was your control before the pregnancy?While I don't have any advice or answers for your question, I just have a ton of questions for you because I have type 1 diabetes and want to have a big family. I'm sure you know the anxiety that comes with wanting to have children while being a diabetic..I wish you, and your soon to be beautiful little addition to this world, the absolute best health, happiness, and luck!M",

    "question": "I am 8 weeks pregnant and on the insulin pump. I seem to have good levels for days than I have higher ones for a few days than I change my doses throughout the day and than they get better. It seems like a non stop cycle. It changes day to day or week to week.Is this normal to have my doses change so often at 8 weeks.Any advice?",
