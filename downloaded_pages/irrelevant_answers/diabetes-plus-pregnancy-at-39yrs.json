            "answer": "I have been diabetic through 2 pregnancies plus my current (18 weeks). When you see your specialist, tell them\u00a0\u00a0about your needle fears. There are micro fine needle and insulin pens with needles so small it's unbelievable. They usually have samples and will walk you through doing injections. Then, you can experiment as to which locations are most comfortable for you.I am on Humalog and Humulin N, with 4 injectiins daily. I use insulin pens with nano needles. I prefer using my belly. Most of the time, i feel NOTHING. Good luck!!!",
