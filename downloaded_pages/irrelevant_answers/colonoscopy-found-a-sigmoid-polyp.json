            "answer": "Hi!I'm 54 years old and had not had a colonoscopy before.\u00a0\u00a0I did the upper GI because I was having heartburn and acid reflux. Found out that I tested positive for HPylori and he said that I have gastritis.\u00a0\u00a0Am now on antibiotics for the HP and then Prevacid after that. Doc said that I also have minimal diverticula.Doc said when he was going to do the endoscopy that I should also get a colonoscopy because of my age (over 50) and glad that I did.I don't have any weight loss, sometimes constipation...but have had that all of my life.\u00a0\u00a0Red color in stool a couple of times, but doc confirmed that I have hemorroids. Also, did a take-home fecal blood test for detection of blood in the stool and came out negative.No family history of colon cancer or cancer that I know of. Father died of natural causes ten years ago and not aware of mother's health because of abandonment at a young age.\u00a0\u00a0Knew here parents, but diabetes runs in their family..that's all the history that I know.In excellent health, as having lost 40 pounds this past year.\u00a0\u00a0Now to normal weight and have been exercising.\u00a0\u00a0I do need more fiber in my diet and have been doing that for the past several months.\u00a0\u00a0Blood test okay, with cholesterol going from 250 to less than 200 and triglycerides at 55.Talked to doc's office on Monday and they told me it was a small, flat, sessile polyp...and hopefully test results would be in by tomorrow (Wednesday)when I go in for appointment.Yes, biopsy taken from the polyp to be sent to the lab.....heard that's just procedure.Appreciate your imput,Thanks,Smilie 114",
