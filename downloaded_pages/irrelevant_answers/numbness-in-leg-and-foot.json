            "answer": "Hi Chilcutt,No I am not diabetic, I will discuss that with my doctor though. I have an appointment with him soon. I believe it might be the way I sit in work, the chairs aren't exactly the best, but when it started happening at home too I started to think it might be something else.Thanks for responding, I will definately speak with my doctor about it.Kerry.",

            "answer": "The most common reasons are :Diabetes Melittus : Have your fasting blood sugar tested.Hypertension : Increase in blood pressure also may cause.Sometimes it also happens due to Vitamin B12 deficiency.But as you do not have continuos numbness and only when you sit so i suspect a chronic back problem, the spinal nerves supply to the upper limbs and lower limbs and also to most part of the body.If by sitting for long hours, have caused some damage then it may be associated with a back problem. Ergonomics is very important while working.(Proper sitting posture)Take care and also take an appointment with a neurologist.Come back to us on further queries.",

    "question": "Hello,This past weekend I started to feel like my right leg and foot was falling asleep, I was in a movie theater and so I thought maybe it was the seating in there. Later Sunday evening the feeling returned, I have no pain associated with this, just a feeling of slight numbness in my foot. I tried putting a heating pad on my back, and it helped a little, but the feeling has come back.I sit a lot in work and thought that might be a cause, though I have never felt this before. It's getting harder to make the feeling stop, like getting up and walking is short relief but when I sit back down it starts again.Does anyone have any ideas on what I might be able to do, or maybe any suggestions as to when might be causing this?Kerry.",
