            "answer": "i know someone who had a short cervix. She found hers very early in the pregnancy, at her first prenatal appointment. She was placed on bedrest for the entire time. She is now 2 days over due! As far as a us at 31 weeks, i had several us and to me they were all the pretty much the same, just the baby got bigger. I had an us a few days ago ( 37 weeks) and at this appointment she told me my baby had curly hair, and weighed 7 lbs 11 oz. Good luck!!",

    "question": "Hi everyone! It's been awhile since I've had a chance to come on here. Hope you are all doing wonderful!!Well, I went for my check-up the other day. My glucose test came back perfect - no gestational diabetes or anemia. I am currently 31 week and my doctor said that I have to go for a second ultrasound. Why? Well, because I have what they call a \"short\" cervix. I have never heard of that before, but I guess it means that my cervix is thinner than most women's. The doctor wants to monitor this because most women with this do not carry the full 40 weeks - usually deliver a few weeks earlier.Has anyone ever had this or know of anyone who has? I'm not super-worried, more curious than anything. And I must admit, I'm a bit excited about seeing my baby again!! :)\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone had a ultrasound at 31 weeks? The baby must be so detailed?Anyway, please let me know if you've heard of anyone having this condition and what a 31 week ultrasound is like...I imagine it's pretty amazing.Thanks ladies! Have a great weekend!",
