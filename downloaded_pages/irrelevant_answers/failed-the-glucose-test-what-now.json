            "answer": "Well then you got gestational diabetes. So you are considered a high risk pregnancy and will be monitored more often. You should be able to control it with diet and excercise but if not they will give you something to help control it.\u00a0\u00a0 You have a higher chance of delivering early and your baby being a bit larger. The doc should go over it with you. My mom had it with one of her three pregnancies. Most of the time it goes away right after you have your baby.",

I was a total gym freak before I got pregnant and the Dr told me to cut back on the gym I wonder if the change had anything to do with it. I feel so bad now like I'm doing something wrong :(",

If you are a health nut it should be super easy to balance your diet to control it which is really good. Just take care of yourself and do as the doctor says and you and baby will be perfectly fine :)",
