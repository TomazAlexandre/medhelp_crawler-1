    "question": "I am 61 and type 2 diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I am having lucentis injections for diabetic retinopathy and they are working very well.\u00a0\u00a0I get a new injection in a few days(the last one has just about has worn off).\u00a0\u00a0I just finished taking Bactrim DS for a UTI.\u00a0\u00a0I had\u00a0\u00a0a lot of side effects including blurred vision and headaches.\u00a0\u00a0\"Visual disturbances\" and headaches were listed as side effects in the patient information.\u00a0\u00a0The other night I had an explosion of white flashers in my right eye, then in my left eye.\u00a0\u00a0They lasted a few minutes. This was followed by some floaters that looked like black threads.\u00a0\u00a0The flashers are now in the outer corners of my eyes and only when I move my head horizontally.\u00a0\u00a0I can bring them on by moving my head and make them go away by holding my head still.\u00a0\u00a0I only see them in the dark.\u00a0\u00a0The floaters are just about gone.\u00a0\u00a0Is this something to worry about?\u00a0\u00a0Is it caused by the Bactrim?\u00a0\u00a0Are these migraines?\u00a0\u00a0I used to get migraines with aura all the time.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe I'm silly to post this question as I'm going to the doctor in a few days but I'm worried now! !\u00a0\u00a0Any help appreciated.",
