Me and my husband use to live in cali by my family and when he decided to get out of the military and move to texas where hes from and near his family at this point we were married 3 years his family treated me like **** and it took him awhile but after i complained to him enough and he saw the way they treated he spoke up after he stuck up for me they started treating me better and stopped talking **** behind my back. If he stands up for you and they stop then that would be great or maybe you guys can get a place with just the 2 of you. Me and my husband have been married 5 years now it gets easier.",
