            "answer": "Hi Louby,There are several things in your post that I feel I have to comment on -you doctors sound a bit off here.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, your glucose is elevated, and I am assuming this was an A1C test which averages your blood sugar numbers over several months.\u00a0\u00a0Mine was 6.8 last year and set off all sorts of concern too.\u00a0\u00a0More testing was done and it was found that I am not diabetic, but an especially indulgent diet over the summer had helped to spike my numbers ( we had traveled to Belgium - the land of chocolate and beer and all things gastronomically good) .\u00a0\u00a0The tests all showed that my sugar was good.Before they jump to the conclusion that you are diabetic and need treatment, ask for additional testing to make sure they are right.As for the balance clinic doing blood tests to check on your heart, with hte exception of checking cardiac enzymes (which elevate IMMEDIATELY after a heart even) and your cholesterol, there isn't much else that cna be checked through your blood.\u00a0\u00a0Because there is such a strong family link to heart disease, you need to be evalauated by a cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I know you are in the UK and that's easier said than done if you are on the NHS.\u00a0\u00a0You need a full work up though since this is maybe an issue - an EKG and a stress test would be in order.\u00a0\u00a0Was your birth father's HA due to blockages or something else?\u00a0\u00a0 The gold standard of tests to check your heart, valves, functions and arteries would be an angiogram, but I doubt that you can get that without exhibiting serious symptoms, again thanks to the NHS's policies.Do not let them start treating you for anything until you get more tests done to confirm their suspicions.I'm sorry you have to worry about this too.\u00a0\u00a0They looked at my A1C numbers at the same time they dx'd me with MS.\u00a0\u00a0I told them I refused to have that too - MS is enough to deal with.\u00a0\u00a0Now my GI doc is talking Celiac Disease and I told him that wasn't going to be a possibility either because I love bread too much and won't easily give up glutens.\u00a0\u00a0 :-)\u00a0\u00a0 Think positive and wait this out before you let it get you down, ok?be well,Lulu",

            "answer": "Exactly what Lu said. It's what I was thinking as I read your post. No blood test can rule out your heart risk so unequivocally, and that glucose elevation with a one-time test is not that meaningful.Good luck and keep us posted.Bio",

            "answer": "I'm going to 3rd what Lu and Bio said.\u00a0\u00a0They should repeat the test in another 3 months and see how that comes out. If it is still over 7, then you might need to talk about what is causing it. In the meantime, you can look at changing your diet to see it the next test will have better and lower results.\u00a0\u00a0None of us here need an additional burden of another disease to deal with and diabetes is one of the biggies.Take care and let us know how this turns out.Julie",

            "answer": "Thank-you to you all for helping put my mind at slight ease, really am so gratefull for that, I was starting to get quite worried & I suppose scared a bit.Lulu54-\u00a0\u00a0Wow your level was 6.8 & they found you were not a Diabetic. That has gave me hope that I will have the same result a you had in the end. Did they say what might have caused it that level at the time, was there anything you did different? Is there anything maybe that might help me at all???I never found out what caused my real dad heart attacks, never wanted to get to know him, but all I know he had 3 major heart attacks & the last 1 he had,he had to have a triple heart bypass. One of my Uncles died of a heart attack years ago, another died from a Embolism,\u00a0\u00a0a aunty died from a major stroke, another auntie heart attack & 2 of my aunties are still alive, one who has had a stroke & suffers with Angina & my other Auntie suffers with Angina. There is only one of my Uncle's (their brother) who does not suffer with his heart & he is nearly 70yrs.When I informed my doctor what I had found out, she said I would not need to worry about that until I go through the menopause & then I would have to have my cholesterol level checked on a regular basis. But it has now bought this back to the surface for me because of my glucose being slightly high & with what I was informed over the phone.I think the balance clinic did the cholesterol test to rule out Peripheral vascular desease, because of my complaint about my legs especially my right leg, the more I walked the worse my leg got.I am going to like you all have suggested wait until I have more testing, if anything ask for another test & hopefully that will prove this was a one off.Thank-you guys for your help & reassurance, its amazing how people you never have met can help in such a big way.",

            "answer": "I'll balance the arguments by saying yes, you should do additional testing, but don't put it off.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is nothing to mess with, either, and far too many people who are told that they may have it live in denial for such a long time that it gets out of control much too easily.\u00a0\u00a0I know; my wife was among them.\u00a0\u00a0I just read her autopsy report this week, and it was listed as a contributing factor.\u00a0\u00a0Don't panic, but please don't brush it off.",

            "answer": "Hi i am in the uk. I had my lumbur puncture recently and the blood tests also showed my glucose levels SLIGHTLY RAISED, and recommended I had a fasting test.Well I spoke to my GP and she said that 2 months ago my level was only 4.2, and wasn't worried. When we talked about it, I had my breakfast at 8am on the morning of my lumber puncture and the procedure not until 12pm. Prior to the procedure I drank a full bottle of full coke as I was told it would help the symptoms of the LP, and a packet of sweets. The doctor said this would have certainly raised my glucose levels.So dont worry too much. My hubby had a raised glucose level of 8 once. After 2 fasting blood tests it went down to normal. They never knew what caused it.Early days yet.big hugs.",

            "answer": "Thank-you for your message, I am going to try & keep positive about this.I went to see the nurse yesturday, where you said they reason they got me in, when my results came back, my doctor noticed how much it had risen from the other tests I had done from the past few years. I was between 4.6 to a 4.8 non fasting & fasting. The last test I had before this was in Feb 09 non fasting which was 4.8. She asked me on the day of the test did I have anything to eat, which I hadn't as I am not a breakfast person, I informed her I had a cup of tea with sugar & that was it.I have been put on a diet cutting out sugar as much as possible & they are going to do a fasting test in Sept as well as a cholesterol test, because of the strong heart defect in my birth family. She did say if your sugar level do come down, you are still going to have to stay on the diet & to have regular tests, as she put it keep a eye on me. but she did make me feel at ease & explain alot of the foods that contain high sugar, I was shocked to learn that some things that say no added sugar can contain more sugar. I would not mind but I am not a sweet tooth person nor do I drink quash or any form of fizzy pop to be honest hate the stuff. My children make up for it.My husband is being so supporting, he is going to change his diet to help me, he said it will not do the children any harm either, which I fully agree.Thank-you for your support & fingers crossed I will have the same result as your husband.",

            "answer": "Hi. I did not read everyone's posts on you question but I wanted to suggest this....I know there are some mixed feelings about the Mayo Clinic but if your insurance will cover it I suggest you go. I went there for an evaluation because MS was suspected....within like a 3 day period they did all kinds of tests to rule out everything. I now know that MS is the only thing that it could be and am currently working with my local dr. They do all the hard work and FAST. If anything else is making you sick, they will find it! They don't give up. Another thing I like about the Mayo is that everyone there is on a salary, so Dr.'s there don't get paid anymore money for tests that they run or people that they help. I feel like they really care and if it were not so far away for me, I would go there for Everything.",

            "answer": "hi Lindsey,Louby is in the UK so coming to Mayo might be totally out of the question! :-)Louby,One of the foods that spike my sugar quickly is Pizza- and the thick crust ones are much worse than the thin crust.\u00a0\u00a0My cravings are often the breads that reek havoc with blood glucose levels, so this has shown me I need to watch those.Also, diabetes runs in my family - the longer I can put off taking that extra pill by watching my diet, weight, and exercise the better off I will be.\u00a0\u00a0I realize I'm making that sound easy but it isn't - I 'm battling the eating right now again and have put on about 15 pounds in a short period of time.\u00a0\u00a0Yikes!!!\u00a0\u00a0I need to get my rear-end up and get moving!!!good luck with controlling this -Lu",

I am going to a Hen Night in a couple of weeks so that will be a challenge for me.Good luck on your diet, I will be encouraging you from over here :) :) :)",

    "question": "I had my blood tests last week as my doctor wanted to check my Iron level , at the time I had asked her could I please be refered to the Neuro because things were getting worse.Well what a little shock I got today!! They said my Glucose was slightly high, it is suppose to be between 3-6 & mine was a 7. I asked is that meaning I might have Diabetes, she said yes & we need to get you in quickly to see the nurse, the nurse will go through everything with you. I am seeing her on Monday, the surgery is closed till then.I found out when I traced my real family down, that my birth dad side have a very strong genetic heart problems, only 1 of the family members on that side have not suffered with the heart. My real dad had his 1st major heart attack at the age of 39yrs. I asked can there be a link between heart & diabetes, she said yes. I did have a blood test to rule out heart problems & Glucose when I went to the balance clinic 9 months ago everything was fine. For the past 3 years I have had a full blood mot test in all 6 times all coming back fine, so this is a recent change in my blood work.Mind you they cannot just go on 1 result can they?? as you do hear results can give out false readings.So I have the worry of this & maybe MS. Whats next??????",
