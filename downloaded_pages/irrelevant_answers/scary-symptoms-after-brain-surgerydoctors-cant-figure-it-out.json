            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your daughter. If there are no neurological cause found for her symptoms then other causes such as electrolyte imbalance, peripheral neuropathy due to Lyme, lupus, thyroid disorders and diabetes need to be ruled out.It can also be due to disorders like myasthenia gravis or restless leg syndrome. Since her symptoms do not cohesively point towards a single disease or disorder, she may need complete neurological and metabolic assessment. ALS or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis may also be a possibility. It could also be fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, and low Vit D.Please consult your daughter\u2019s treating doctors regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
