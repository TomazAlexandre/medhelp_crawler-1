I can't answer your diabetes question because I don't have personal experience with this.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure you'll get to the bottom of what is causing your blood sugar to drop.\u00a0\u00a0In the meantime, try not to get yourself so worked up. Unfortunately,\u00a0\u00a0the more worked up we get, the more the heart likes to react.\u00a0\u00a0I know that's easier said than done but the good thing is you will be going to a physician who will find out what is going on .What did they tell you when you were in the ER?Betty",
