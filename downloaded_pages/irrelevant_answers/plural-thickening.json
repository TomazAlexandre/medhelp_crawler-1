            "answer": "Hi,Its best you discuss your concerns with your doctor. What is crucial here is why the imaging study (whether this is Xray or CT scan) was requested.Pleural thickening may mean a number of things. It may only be a remnant of a previous infection which has completely healed (X-rays tend to have a lag phase - in which all symptoms have resolved and yet the image isn't too normal), it may even be a normal variation (as you are more than 60 - some wear and tear on the lung may make separating the normal from abnormal difficult to do). Chances are, if you don't feel anything at all - its nothing to worry about.Discuss your concerns with your doctor.",

            "answer": "Hi,The information you provided is not really specific for anything. The lung can react to various insults in a limited number of ways, and the X-ray cannot provide that much detail. Among the things to consider would be chronic infections like tuberculosis which has a predilection for the upper lobes due to the higher oxygen tension in that area. A reaction to a drug, a hypersensitivity reaction would also be important to consider. If you have any risk factors for pleural disease (asbestos occupational exposure), then malignancy would also be considered.How do you feel? Is there breathlessness? Cough? There may also be some age-related changes in the chest X-ray, and hence, in the absence of any symptoms \u2013 the findings may still be within normal for your age.Discuss the results with your doctor and come up with further diagnostic or a treatment plan. Stay positive.",
