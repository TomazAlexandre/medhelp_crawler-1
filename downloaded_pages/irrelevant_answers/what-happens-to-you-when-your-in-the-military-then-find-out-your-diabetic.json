            "answer": "Hi, being the daughter of a 26 years veteran naval officer and the wife of a air force officer, plus haveing diabetis myself, I can tell you before he deploys due to his new diagnoses he will get a medical evaluation, or he should anyways.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure but in my opinion it wouldn't be wise to send him overseas if he just got diagnosed and his diabetis\u00a0\u00a0isn't\u00a0\u00a0controlled yet.I can't really help with the military aspect but if you need answers on diabetis I am your woman.\u00a0\u00a0My mother has had type one diabetis for over 30 years and I have had type2 diabetis for over 7.Good Luck!",

            "answer": "Hi, My name is Brian and I have had diabetes for 23 years come July 1st 2012. The best advise I can give is to not go overseas with this disease, even if you're a well fit and controlled diabetic you can't stop all the complications that can occur with the disease and your body and with that said we all know there's not time outs in war....Someday I hope there will be something out there we can do for the armed forces but for now it is best to let the men and women that are healthy without diabetes do what they do best. Keep your heads up diabetic people, there are plenty of things we can make ourselves useful for but the number one thing is to take care of yourself and live a long and healthy life!! God bless the U.S.A.",

            "answer": "I have lived in both Germany and now in France. I have my pump for ten years now. In France all TYPE 1 have a pump, if you want one. I am an AMERICANspend 20 yrs in the U.S. Army, worldwide deployments . The American health system, is a joke. All of Europe have some sort national health care, most people don't pay a penny for health care. We just need to copy the European system, and stop treating Diabetes as a death sentence.Most of the answers in this blog, are wrong. Your all need to change Dr's, and get updated, on all the new treatments in other countries . Moving to Europe saved my life, no thanks on living in the US .",

    "question": "My husband is in the army and has served his country for a little over 2 years of active duty. He has recently been told he is diabetic. My husband doesn't like to tell me much about what will happen so my questions are,can and will they kick him out of the Army?If they do kick him out will he still get benifits and military pay??Basicly I am worried about my husband and his health but have read enough to know he can be fine if he takes care of him self. Now I'm worried about what will happen to us? We have two young children and I dont want to be just thrown back into the cavilian life with no job and no home. Will the military help us or just send us on our way?? Please any help would be nice!",
