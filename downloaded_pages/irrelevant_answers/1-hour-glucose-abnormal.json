            "answer": "My 1 HR and my 3 HR came back high and the doctor diagnosed me with gestational diabetes. I now have to check my blood sugars 4 times a day and have to see and specialist every 4 weeks. However, I don't have to take any medications because I am glad to say I am diet controlled.\u00a0\u00a0Even if you Andre diagnosed with gestational diabetes there are ways that you can be medication free by controlling your diet and with minimal exercise. I wouldn't worry about it too much. Just try and rend make better choices with meals and snacks and you shouldn't have an dreaded problem. :)",
