            "answer": "I would also like to pump insulin, but there's no possible way topay for it or for the recurring monthly expenses.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps in the future, you'll meet somebody who has health insurance or money. So keep your health intact as much as possible by keeping your BG under control.\u00a0\u00a0I recommend you read the book \"Diabetes Solution\" by Dr. Richard K. Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0I also recommend you take up cross-country running to keep your weight under control.Nick",

            "answer": "I spoke to the company Animas that produces a nice pump. I currently use MiniMed which is horrible.\u00a0\u00a0They treated me very poorly and I have had major problems with their product. My advise is stay away from them.When I spoke with a sales person from Animas they told me they have several different ways to purchase their pumps if I didn't have insurance. A reduced price, loan, etc.\u00a0\u00a0You might wamt to speak with the company directly. The website to Animas is: http://www.animascorp.com/index2.shtmlAs far as supplies go.\u00a0\u00a0I know the \"companies\" and \"doctors\" don't won't tell you this but I often reuse the syringes a couple of times, I don't change the site every two days as they recommend, etc.\u00a0\u00a0This has worked for me over the 6 years I have used the pump and has allowed me to continue to use it when money was tight.Best of luck in finding some resource. Try a community resource as well. Some times a church organization, local diabetic group or community drive can help.\u00a0\u00a0Last year I knew someone who had switched pumps (From MiniMed) and had a years worth of supplies to give to me.",

    "question": "i am and have been very intreseted in getting hooked up on the pump. i am 18 now and told my doctor lets do it. when my mother and i learned of how much it would all cost, we couldn't beleive it, but after talking this over with family members, they decided i should still do it and they would help with the expenses. i was pratically all set, and had done my log for a week when my doctor explained that we would have to pay an additional amount for the supplies each month. my mom realized that this wasn't going to be a possibility for me and apolagized. more than anything i want a pump but just can't afford it. we have checked out jdf and trying to see if there is any help but there really isn't any. what can i do to make this a possibility for me. thanks",
