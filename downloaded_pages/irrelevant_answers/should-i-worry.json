    "question": "I'm 25 Weeks and just haven't been feeling right. I have had hypoglycemia (my sugar can drop as low as 40s non pregnant) for years so I can test my sugar at home when I need to. With not feeling right i've tested it last night and today some. Last night it was running high 130s before I ate dinner\u00a0\u00a0and this morning my fasting was 126. So I worry about this? I have my 1 hr gtt on the 16th but don't know of I should try to move it sooner. I just don't know if i'm over reacting lol. Do you girls think I should call the dr.?",
