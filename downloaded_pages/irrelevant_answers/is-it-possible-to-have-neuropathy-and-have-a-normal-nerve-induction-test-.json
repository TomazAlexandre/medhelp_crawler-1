            "answer": "Hello,have you been tested for diabetes / are diagnosed with diahetes?If you have what are your results? Hba1c, blood sugar levels on home meter.It is likely possible that early in the process of neuropathy damage, it may not be picked up yet by the testing.The best way to prevent and/or reverse neuropathy (if it is caused by high blood sugars / diabetes) is normalisation of blood sugars.Totally normal hba1c is < 5.0, and totally normal fasting and post eating blood sugars will be in the range of 70 - 95 or so, all the time.",

            "answer": "I was tested about four years ago by drinking this orange drink and then they checked my sugar levels. They checked it then because I complained about extreme thirst, urine smelling like sugar, extremely sleepy after eating and yeast infections. The doc said I was within normal parameters however since then the neuropathy is getting really bad and I'm having stronger symptoms so I'm going to have my doctor retest me apparently now there are more efficient testing then there was previously hopefully they'll figure something out because none of these other doctors are listening to me at all I have multiple symptoms that I haven't even discussed on here it's too long to even tell it all I have 6 discs messed up in my lower back and 1 in my neck and I have hypothyroid disease I have Marie charcot tooth disease I have Parkinson's have extremely flat feet have to wear special Orthotics I have intestinal problems I have two ulcers ones in my esophagus I have Barrett's esophagus extreme acid reflux GERD the list goes on and on I can't even name it all but it seems like all of the horrible DNA that is in my family bloodline on both sides has been dumped into me and I just had the worst of everything",

            "answer": "In addition, I have healthy eating habits walk about 4 miles a week if not more. I also work running around on my feet all day with half hour lunch. This is making the neuropathy worse. I just got this job three weeks ago and already had to leave early and ended up in the ER that day because of pain and swelling and I had to call off the next day and didn't come back to work for 2 days but even then I could barely walk this job I've had for 3 weeks is the longest amount of time I've been able to keep a job in four years I have always been a really hard worker my entire life and I have even herded cattle baled hay I'm a Certified mechanic a certified welder I've been in security work as a supervisor for 4 years none of these things I can do anymore. I have done a man's job my whole life and damaged my body because I've pushed myself past my abilities and now I'm paying for it. Now I found out that I do in fact have carpel tunnel which I already knew because I've already had to have surgery on my left arm which worked well. Sometimes its everything I can do to get out of bed.Sometimes I forget I'm a woman and some things just aren't healthy for me.",
