            "answer": "\"I can't remember what they told me the range should be 2 hours after eating.\"For t2 diabetics the postprandial [2-3 hrs after meal] level should be <141 mg/dl, but strive for <121 mg/dl. Of course you'd like to obtain <99 mg/dl, normal.You should test preprandial [b4 a meal]. This provides a baseline measurement to compare against postprandial test results. This way you will see how foods you consumed affect your blood sugar levels.It's good to see your A1c lowering. However, @ 6.3% equates to a daily blood sugar average of 134 mg/dl. Continue to follow the three basic rules of diabetes control and management. This helps get your blood sugars as close too if not down to normal levels; 1] eat a diabetic diet low in carbs free of sugary foods and liquids, avoid foods made with white flour and starchy foods like potatoes, white rice and pasta; 2] maintain normal body weight; 3] daily 30-60 min of exercise. Good luck -",

            "answer": "Thank You for your info. I did what you suggested and checked my bs before and after my meals for 3 days (since I'm actually only suppose to check it once a day per Dr) they were all under 120 and looking at my chart I've only been over 120 three times since June and I do understand the importance of diet. Since I was diagnosed on March 13th I've lost 60 pounds with 50 pounds to go. My husband has been diabetic since 1987 and is now terminal with End Stage Renal Disease and on dialysis 3 times a week. I do not want to follow him down the same path, so believe me I've seen first hand what diabetes can do and I will do everything I can to make sure what my husband is dealing with and going through doesn't happen to me, if I can help it.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes in March of this year. My A1C was 7.8. I was given Metformin to take 2x Daily. They told me they wanted my fasting blood sugar to be 70 - 110, but I can't remember what they told me the range should be 2 hours after eating. I am only suppose to check my blood sugars once a day so I try to do it at a different time every day and I just can't remember what they told me what they should be after eating. Oh, and my A1C was down to 6.3 when they retested it in June.Thank You",
