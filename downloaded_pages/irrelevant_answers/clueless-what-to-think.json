    "question": "I have hypothyroidism,\u00a0\u00a0and I recently been told that I have hypotension and told to buy a blood pressure machine and blood sugar checker. I have monitored both for a week. I was instructed to check pressure whenever i was dizzy. A lot if times i am not able. This 95/63 and blood sugar 105, 94/50, 97/65 and 120 sugar, 90/63, 112/79 & 105 sugar, 90/62 & 101 sugar, 106/67 &111 sugar. I have been told the dizziness could be an inner ear issue. I am extremely fatigued to the point of sleeping most of the day (when I am actually very active). I've been experiencing horrible headaches and migraines for four months, my vision is so blurred that my prescription contacts/glasses dont always help (it's like I have nothing on to help me see), and I have some chest pains that aren't really strong but annoyingly achy and uncomfortable. I've gained 30 pounds!My father passed away from diabetes and heart isdues. My brother ,47, has had a mild heart attack. My mother has had a quadruple heart bypass.Now, should I be worried or is this all pressure?",
