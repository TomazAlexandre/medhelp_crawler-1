I'm on a strict diet and I have to check my sugar four times a day not fun at all. The beginning of my pregnancy I barely ate anything but bread ate a lot of sweet stuff and fruits. And I would sometimes skip meals because the sweets made me lose my appetite. So ladies so down with the sweets and take in some protein. Hope this help.",
