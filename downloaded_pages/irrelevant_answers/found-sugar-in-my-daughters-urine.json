            "answer": "Hello,It could be from any number of reasons they are telling you to come back.Sugar in the urine isn't normal. It seems a little odd that they would tell you to just come back in a week if she had sugar in her urine.Being a diabetic myself, when i have sugar in my urine, it means that i have a very high blood sugar, and that is a dangerous thing for me.But, there are also allot of other symptoms of diabetes too, for instance, excessive thirst and urination, vomiting, and weakness to name a few.If she gets worse, I would think about bringing her in to see another doctor for a 2nd opinion.Best of luck.",

            "answer": "Given they found sugar in her urine, I would think they should have also tested her blood sugar.I would be trying to get a second opinion here.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know of any non-diabetic conditions that would cause sugar in urine.Can you get her blood sugar tested?If she appears to get sicker or you are worried, do not hesitate to take her to the emergency room.\u00a0\u00a0Better safe than sorry and if she does have diabetes it can be very dangerous if untreated.However, I hope it is as simple as UTI.",

            "answer": "They said there was no infection, and that is why they ran other tests. Her doctor said they didnt want to run any blood work on her because she didn't want to scare her with needles. I started watching her after I read the symptoms and she has been more tired as in taking naps and not as active as usually. She is still active, just she started taking naps which she has never done, however this could be from pre school since she just started this year and it could be wearing her body dome. She eats a lot and I saw that is symptom too she hasn't gained any weight or lost any weight though and I just saw this as maybe she is having a growth spurt.\u00a0\u00a0I never really had to deal with diabetes. As I have been healthy all my life. But I called my mom to ask her about it and she said that diabetes does run in our family. I think I might go get a second opinion at our urgent care center tomorrow just to be on the safe side. I can't help but worry its my baby and I wanna make sure shes healthy.",

            "answer": "I never went to the urgent care. She seemed fine so I just waited for the doctors appointment. She was fine for the next UA. However the doc wouldn't answer my questions for why she had sugar in her urine one time and not the next. And she said it was from dehydration, but I know my daughter wasn't. I am gonna see a different doc soon for a second opinion. I'm glad she's ok but I want answers that actually make since. Also the reading was 100 for sugar in the urine and 15mg for ketones. For the first UA and the second had zero reading for them.",

    "question": "I took my 4 year old daughter to the doctor for a suspected UTI. She said it hurt when she went pee. She also said it itched and her belly kinda hurt. The doctor came back and said they found sugar in her urine. They told me to give her plenty of water and come back in a week and they would retest. I am worried and was sort of shocked so I did not know the questions to ask. Should I be scared or is the doc telling me to come back in a week just them being careful and to rule it out?",
