I will send you private message with information that will help you.The medication you're on helps type 2 patients and may not be suited for you. The best thing you can do to help your self is test, test, test your blood glucose. Test before a meal to get a reference range. Then test 2-3 hours after a meal to see how the foods you consumed affected your blood glucose levels. Avoid/eliminate or cut way back on those that elevate your range above normal. After meals aim for less than 140 mg/dl or 7.78 mmol/l.",

            "answer": "With diabetes, unless you are really sure of what you are doing, my advice is to follow the instructions and protocols of your physician. Many clinics have registered nurse practicioners who specialize in writing script and monitoring this illness. In my experience they are VERY good and professional.Getting diabetes under control means taking your blood sugars and submitting to a period hba1c test as well as liver function tests.It is important that your protocol be consistant, and not change from day to day.If you are disatisfied with your diabetic provider, there are others, but I would not decide to alter my medications on my own, unless I was really competent in the field of medicine.",
