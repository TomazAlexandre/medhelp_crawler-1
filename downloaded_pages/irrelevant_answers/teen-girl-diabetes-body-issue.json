            "answer": "hi hon, im mum to a 16yr old whos been diabetic for 7yrs, she also has body image problems, has actually just discharged from hospital where she was being treated for an eating disorder, her weight got very low and she was very sick. but the stange thing was the more weight\u00a0\u00a0she lost the more any fat she had at all became much more prominent on her belly, it was really quite strange, her body was so thin apart from a swollen belly. i know it was really troubling for her, since she has been recieving treatment her weight is almost back where it should be and her belly looks far less pronounced.can i ask, your on very small doses of insulin, are you taking your prescribed amount? i only ask for your safety and i also wanted you to know that getting really thin will make the problem worse. i dont know what the answer is im afraid. i know that with my daughter if her blood sugars got really high she gets very constipated and then her belly really goes for it!!i also just wanted to empathise with you, this is a tough illness and most people just dont understand it, even though my daughter has been diabetic since she was small she struggles with the same issues as you. you are not alone, i wish i could be of more help but if you want to talk to someone who knows this illness inside out then please just post, would love to hear from you, take care, louise",

    "question": "It's been really hard for me to reach out like this after so long of hiding my little problem and taking advice from people who have no idea what complications type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent) has with weight loss. I've been through the fads, even tried the shakes which was the worst idea and didn't last long. Worked out religiously and condemned any 'junk' food to hell, well i still do. I am a 16 year old female, who has only been living with diabetes for a year and a half. I have experienced a drastic weight gain of about 20kilos leaving me at 73kg and 151cms. I have lost some of that weight and now sit at 60kilos. Have a nice body but am still over my goal of 55kilos. BEFORE YOU STOP READING hear me out. I am seeking help on how to lose or at least improve this irregular belly fat I have acquired since my weight gain and have lost everything but that. It isn't just a bludge of fat, it is actually pockets on either side of the bellybutton. One stage we (doctor) thought it was Lipo but wasn't \"lumpy\" enough. Needless to say, extremely WEIRD and extremely UNATTRACTIVE. I am on novorapid and levimir which helped with some of the weight loss. But I am still only taking minuscule amounts of insulin, 2 units breakfast and lunch, 3 at dinner and 9 units of levemir. I am also taking 50micro gms of Eutroxsig. I eat healthy, there is no doubt that I take care of myself. I am scared s***less to think of ending up in the ambulance again. I have tried cutting down on my carbs. I have not injected in that area for 3months now. I have done 250-300 sit ups a day. I still run 3 kilometres 2-3 times a week .BUT I cannot seem to leave behind this tummy or lose any more weight either. Is anyone able to end my constant battle between diabetes and the bikini? Please no more stories and inconclusive advice because I am over taking months out of my life to see no results.To help you understand my issue I have braved up and added a photo of this 'belly', hopefully you can see what I mean by \u2018side pockets\u2019 or \u2018pot belly\u2019. Please help if you can or get back to me if you are a young adult in the same boat. I don't know anyone else who is diabetic as I live in a small country town and no one in my family has had a history of it. . . EVER!!!\u00a0\u00a0I just so happened to be the 'lucky' one =)Thank you all.Your support will be appreciated like food to an Ethiopian.",
