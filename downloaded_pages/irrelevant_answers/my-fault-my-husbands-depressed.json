            "answer": "I'm sorry you are BOTH going through this. I think you are a great wife for even thinking about how to cheer him up in the middle of dealing with how you are feeling. Think of something for the both of you. My husband and I do this thing we call \"The Good Count\". It is where we literally count off our blessings. It helps to put things in perspective. It usually occurs in the middle of a sh*t storm. HA! It can be as simple as recognizing the roof over your head, food on your table, etc. It always cheers us up. I hope things start looking brighter for you both.",
