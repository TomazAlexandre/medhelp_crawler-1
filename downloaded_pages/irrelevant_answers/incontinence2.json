            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Needless to say, this is an uncommon problem in adults. I fully empathize with you. Yes, stress can cause many types of symptoms. Night time bed wetting or incontinence could be due to stress, functionally small bladder, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus, urinary bladder wall instability, UTI, stones and neurological problems. Urinary bladder wall problem has been deducted in your case. However you can discuss your case with\u00a0\u00a0your urologist. The enumerated the possibilities can be investigated or ruled out one by one by your physician. A psychological assessment of the situation may also help.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "A year ago I started having some night time incontinence along with panic attacks. My doctor said I have benign prostrate enlargment and should see a urologist. The Urologist said I should have a cyscoscopy. This test showed that my bladder was not emptying when I pee. He saw evidence of long term tension in the detrusor muscle which he thought was caused by a constriction of the ureathra by the prostrate. He recommended that I try \"flow max\" to reduce the constriction. If this doesn't work he said I should have a surgical \"roto-rooter\" completed to open it up. He also said that this proceedure can cause scar tissue and need repetition. I received a staff infection from the procedure which I think is gone now. I tried the flow max for a month. I now take some herbal remedies and my urine flow is strong (in fact it was always strong). I still am having the incontinence almost every night\u00a0\u00a0after I get deeply asleep. I do not want to do the roto rooter and mess things up even more. After the cyscoscopy, I got the UTI and also I sometimes get a pain in the scrotum that comes and goes. I never had this before.My view is that I have always had a psychological stress which I have held for years in my bladder. It is related to childhood trauma. The stress is putting my destrusor muscle into spasm and it doesn't empty properly. Since I have strong urine flow I don't believe that the bladder not emptying is due to the prostrate restriction of the urethra. Does this make any sense to you and what do you recommend I do from here? Thank you",
