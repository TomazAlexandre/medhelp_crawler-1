            "answer": "I love to hear you talk about Jean, he was a great man and I know how much you miss him. It is the little things that we remember the most. I know you hold him tight in your heart and I know he is always watching out for you (like I have said many times mom lol) I will be thinking of you tomorrow on this day. I know he will be near you tomorrow also. I think if something was to happy to my husband I would miss his smile the most and the way he jokes around with me to cheer me up. His sence of humor is what made me fall in love with him in the first place. I remember when I was having Austin, I was sitting on the side of the bed getting the shot in my back and he knew I hated it so he kept making little jokes and everytime he did I would laugh and of course when your in labor laughing makes it worse but he is the only man I know that can make his wife laugh when she is in the worse pain of her life. After I had my daugher he almost passed out for all of it and he looked at me and said \"Never again, never again will I touch you so I can't get you pregnant again LOL\" He would walk the parking lot with his mom cause he was having stomach cramps. Enough about me.I am glad your ultrasound was clean that is one less thing to worry about. I hope this new cream works for you, cause I know how sick you was during the infection and I don't want to see you that sick again. I will be thinking of you on Thursday all day so post when you get back!! Well as soon as you can. I know you have a wonderful granddaughter to look after also. How is summer school going?Hang in there momLoveJamie",

            "answer": "Thanks Jamie,He was a fantastic person and you all would have loved him. He was 6' 0\" tall and a little overweight at 200 lbs. (until the Diabetes made him hold a LOT of water at the end). He's a fraternal twin. His twin brother looks more and more like him as the years go bye. But Jean always told everyone (even in front of Jack) that he was the better looking one\u00a0\u00a0-- LOL.His sense of humor topped everyone's and everyone wanted to be around him. He was a natural blonde ( just like you) and he DID NOT AGE at all. Not even with his health problems. ( I was SOOOO jealous.\u00a0\u00a0:)\u00a0\u00a0) Because of his Blonde hair and fair complexion (when he wasn't tan) and his \"tummy\" and the fact that he ALWAYS had a fantastic, contagious smile on his face he was given the name of \"Pooh Bear\"! So everyone called him \"Pooh\". I would have given anything if he had been able to meet our Granddaughters but he didn't. He would have spoiled them to pieces. However, they KNOW Grandpa \"Pooh\" and EVERYTHING their is to know about him. And they LOVE him!!You're right Jamie, I feel him with me at all times. But there are some times that the feeling is intense and today was one of those days. Unbelievably intense, expecially coming home from the Doctors today.\u00a0\u00a0:)Jamie, that is so funny about your Hubby. I do believe that every Hubby at least thinks about making that promise about NEVER touching their wives again. However, you notice that it never lasts longer than 6 weeks, though.\u00a0\u00a0LOLThank you guys so much!! And Thanks for listening....Sherry",

            "answer": "Jean sounds so much like my husband. Everyone loves to be around him cause he is so laided back and so funny. He is 250 and 6'1 so he isn't a little guy but he has a big heart. He was just tested for diabetes so we are waiting for the results. His dad has diabetes so we have to watch him and my kids. My mom is a twin! So my daughter thinks she is going to have twins lolI bet Jean can see his granddaughters and he has to be so proud of everything you have done for them while dealing with so much pain, you are a very strong, loving woman!! And I am very thankful to have you as a friend!!!Jamie",

    "question": "Hi Everybody,I was supposed to have my Urologist appointment last week but when I got there she was 2 hours behind and I couldn't wait as I have to be home to get my Granddaughter off of the bus and so we switched it for today.My Ultrasound on my abdomen came back clean so that was VERY good news. It turns out that the Bladder infection I had was caused by an Ecoli\u00a0\u00a0bug. It was not a normal infection ( but then I have NEVER done anything NORMAL in my life - LOL) therefor that was the reason for all of the different antibiotics that I went thru. It doesn't respond to most antibiotics.She gave me a Prescription for some Premarin Cream that I'm supposed to apply topically 2 to 3 times a week and that will help keep UTI infections\u00a0\u00a0from happening!Next for me is the BIGGIE on Thursday. The Orthopedic Surgeon. I picked up all of my pictures from my MRI today to take to him. I just hope that he can fix this botched surgery.\u00a0\u00a0The scarry thing is that the \"Bad\" Surgeon may have cut away too much of my Hip Bone. If that\u00a0\u00a0has happened I don't know what can be done. We'll just have to wait and see.Also, tomorrow is the 13th Anniversary of my Wonderful Husband Jean's passing. I MISS him SOOOO MUCH!!It seemed just like yesterday not 13 years ago. It''s truly amazing, you don't forget anything. It is still so vivid. Every detail.This is going to sound silly to some of\u00a0\u00a0you, but the thing that I miss the most is \"holding his hand\". Everywhere we went, the ENTIRE 16 years gthat we were married, we held each others hand. In case you can't tell, I STILL LOVE this man more than anything!!!Sorry, I just needed to say that.I'll let you guys know what happens on Thursday.\u00a0\u00a0(((HUGS!!))) to you ALL...Sherry",
