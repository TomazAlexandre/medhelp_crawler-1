            "answer": "Hello dear and welcome to the medhelp forum. I understand your anxieties well and empathize with you.\u00a0\u00a0Tingling and numbness in both the hands could be due to nerve compression or pinched nerve in the neck, cervical spondylosis. Have you been checked for carpal tunnel syndrome, due to median nerve compression at the wrists? Check for diabetes and related peripheral neuropathy as the possible cause for this symptom. MS had well-defined diagnostic criteria with specific MRI features, which you do not have. You can discuss these speculations with your neurologist. Hope it helps and wish you the very best.",

    "question": "Hello,I have been trying to find an origin for my symptoms since August. I started having tingling in both hands/fingers after reading about MS. I am historically not a hypochondriac. I had been having a lot of uncontrollable life stresses and I went to my PCP as I was not feeling well (nausea, dizzy, not sleeping, etc).When giving me a full physical neurological exam, he asked if anyone in my family had MS (just one of his questions, not indicative of his analysis), I said no, then I went home and googled it and freaked out for about five days. I went to three, yes THREE, neurologists and got MRI's and every possible test. All said no sign of MS anywhere and this is either stress or peripheral nerve damage due to stress, etc.While I truly want to believe that, I have basically had tingling and numbness in all ten fingers on and off since August. When I am feeling no stress in my life at all, I get it. I also have a patch of numbness on the top of my right foot...this has been explained to me as nerve damage from all my knee surgeries I have had four 15 years (a dance injury).My question is, do these symptoms of tingling and sometimes electric shocks in my wrist sound neurological in nature, or do they sound like a response to my body dealing with stress and anxiety? A stress and anxiety that I do not believe exists?Thanks so much",
