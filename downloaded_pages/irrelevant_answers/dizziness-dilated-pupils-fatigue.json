            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I read through your post. Based on the information provided by you, I think you are suffering from \u2018benign intracranial hypertension\u2019(BIH). This happens due to impaired CSF absorption. A generalized throbbing headache worst felt in the morning and last thing at night. This headache is generally relieved on standing (consistent with raised intracranial pressure). It is aggravated by straining, coughing or a change in position. This headache is accompanied by various neurological symptoms such as dizziness, numbness, loss of vision, loss of hearing etc, all of which are temporary.The other possibility is severe fall in blood glucose or blood pressure, high BP or diabetes.It can be any other cause too. Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult a doctor immediately\u2014go to ER if that is fastest. Take care!",
