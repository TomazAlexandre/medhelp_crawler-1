            "answer": "I hate to be so blundt but I don't believe going to sleep for 3 days will cure you. There are no quick fixes in this or in life. Sure the worst and most physically painful w/d's last about 4 days but the road to recovery (in my opinion) really starts when you get through the physical. The emotional part is the hardest part I'm my opinion.How much suboxone are you on?\u00a0\u00a0And why do you tale other opiates with it?\u00a0\u00a0You can't be getting high?\u00a0\u00a0From what my doc says some people need to be on suboxone long term and he seems to feel that physically it is ok. He thinks of opitate addiction like diabetes. You certainly wouldn't deny someone insulin shots so if someone needs to take 8mg of suboxone for a very long time then why not?\u00a0\u00a0If it works to keep the cravings in check.I have been on suboxone for nearly 2 wks now and I did slip once and took a few pain pills and I did not get high at all so I am comfused as to why you are mixing the 2.",

            "answer": "Thanks for responding. I need the help. I am not mixing now ... just on Subutex. This is my second time around on it but when I try to taper down, my brain panics. You are correct that the physical withdrawels are easy compared to the mental side of it. That is my problem. If I don't take enough, a dreadful fear and panic sets in. I can't stand it but I really need to stop this stuff.",

I want to go to sleep for 3 days and wake up okay. Is ther a cocktail of meds to help get through the worst part? I'm desperate. Thanks.",
