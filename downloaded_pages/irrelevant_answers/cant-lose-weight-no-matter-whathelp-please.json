            "answer": "What do you mean, you \"did\" have a thyroid problem?\u00a0\u00a0If your thyroid hormone levels are not adequate, even if they are in the so-called \"normal\" ranges, weight loss is going to be very difficult, if not impossible.\u00a0\u00a0Are you on a thyroid replacement medication?Another thing is eating a lot of fruit is not good for a diabetic because even though it's \"natural\" the sugar in fruit still spikes your blood sugar, which, in turn spikes your insulin levels.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't use all the food you eat, for immediate energy, insulin shuttles the glucose straight to fat cells to be stored for later use, but you may not be using enough of it.PCOS is related to insulin resistance and/or type II diabetes and is often treated with metformin.\u00a0\u00a0Are you still taking the metformin?Your diet should center on vegetable, lean protein from chicken, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, etc...\u00a0\u00a0protein will help keep you feeling fuller longer without spiking your blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0You should also be sure to add some healthy fats to every meal. Healthy fats include olive and coconut oil, avocados, nuts and nut butters, etc.\u00a0\u00a0These fats also help make you feel more satisfied without increasing your blood sugar levels.Every time you increase your blood sugar levels, you increase your insulin levels, which causes your body to store more fat, so the idea is to eat foods that are called \"low glycemic foods\".\u00a0\u00a0 These are foods that take longer for the body to break down, so your blood sugar levels stay more steady.You should try not to eat within 3 hours of going to bed.\u00a0\u00a0If you eat a lot of veggies, protein and adequate healthful fats for dinner, your blood sugar shouldn't drop at bed time.Very few people lose weight \"without even trying\"... Some lucky ones who were hypothyroid and got their thyroid hormone levels properly adjusted - maybe... I'm hypothyroid and I've been struggling for 8 yrs to lose the 30 lbs I gained when I first went hypo, then the 15 more I gained while fighting my doctor to adjust med properly... I do have \"pre-diabetes\", so after giving on the \"protein shake diet\" my doctor wanted me on, which only caused me to gain more, I implemented a diet like I outlined above, making sure to add, at least 1 tablespoon of healthy fat at each meal and I managed to lose 23 lbs, but now I'm stalled again, so I'm going back to the drawing board...Cinnamon is spice and it's been shown to help keep blood sugar levels more stable, but it won't help you lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0Chromium picolinate also helps insulin work better.\u00a0\u00a0Scientific research does not support claims that, either cinnamon or chromium picolinate are effective for weight loss.Most pills and other weight loss supplements don't work and if you find one that does, it's not meant for long term use, so it will only work as long as you take it and once you stop, whatever weight you lose, will most likely be regained, if you don't adopt lifestyle changes and if you're adopting lifestyle changes, you can lose the weight without the pills...",

    "question": "I am at the point I don't know what to do. I'm having problems losing weight. Before I get into this, yes I did have thyroid problems, low levels, and, as my doctor says, I have a history of diabetes. Both are ok for now, but I'm afraid of my diabetes coming back because of this.Back three years ago I found out I was diabetic with an a1c of 10.8! At that time I weighed 218. I was put on metformin and was told to watch my sand I eventually I got down to 169 and I was super happy! Well I was told my levels were fine and no longer considered diabetic ranges, and I will admit I didn't follow the diet I had when the levels we're higher. Now a little over a year and a half, maybe two years later I'm back up, even higher at 225!I'm disgusted at myself. Every time I look in the mirror I want to cry and I hate myself. I am on birth control which I don't think would make me gain this much weight. I was told I have pcos if that makes a difference.\u00a0\u00a0And e thing is I'm in a community clinic cause I can't afford insurance and the dr there tells me that they don't discuss weight issues so no help there!I only drink water,, sometimes those sugar free powders u put in there. I don't eat sugary snack foods. I am eating more fruits and veggies. I am a full time babysitter, but I always go for one long walk every morning with the kids (yes they actually love it) at least 30 minutes there, then after the other two meals I go for a smaller walk about 5-10 minutes to the end of the street. I can't afford a gym membership and my doctor said 30 minutes of walking 5 days, I do more than that, every day! Now I will admit sometimes I do eat something right before I go to bed, especially if my sugar feels like it's dropping, but I can't imagine it's making me gain this much. Can someone please help me? My doctor won't help me, the pharmacist said everything for eight loss over the counter won't help cause it's more like, helps u lose the extra water weight and wouldn't help me.I'm sick of hearing everyone else talk about how much weight they have lost without even trying and here I am gaining it. I have heard of this one vitamin cinnamon plus chromium, someone on my street says it helps metabolism and helps lose weight, does it?",
