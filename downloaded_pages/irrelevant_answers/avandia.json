    "question": "Hi allMy partner has Type 2 diabetes, he let his symptoms go for a while without medication but his blood sugar increased.\u00a0\u00a0So he went back on the medication about 2 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0He is taking Avandia 4mg twice a day, his GP said whilst presribing that 'the jury is still out on Avandia.' and he would review it next month. This made me google the drug and all I am getting is Avandia and lawsuits in relation to heart disease.\u00a0\u00a0Yes I would say the jury have retired on this one, what worries me more is that for about the last 3 weeks my partner has had pins and needles in his left arm and some pain.\u00a0\u00a0Should he stop these drugs now and look for an alternative, or am I being carried away by the hype.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry I haven't looked through the site to see if this has come up before.\u00a0\u00a0It is my first time posting to this forum but I am scared for himJane",
