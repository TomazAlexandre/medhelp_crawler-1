            "answer": "Hi and welcome,It's always best to get the opinion of your neuro but from my lay persons perspective, mild micro vascular white matter lesions in the subcortical and periventricular areas of the brain, would not be unexpected findings in a patient who has a medical history of high blood pressure (hypertension), migraine, diabetes etc.It's likely you'll need a spinal MRI to see if your gate issues are caused by a spinal issues eg degenerative disc, spinal cord lesions etc but keep in mind, if your clinical signs were not actually abnormal there could be other medical explanations you'll need to be tested for too.Cheers.....JJ",
