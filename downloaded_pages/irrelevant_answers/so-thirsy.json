            "answer": "I have been diabetic for over 20 years (type 1, not 2). I am in no way an expert at Gestational Diabetes, but what you said about when you sit to work and the balls of your foot tingling...in diabetes, that only happens after you have been diabetic for a LONG time and either have not taken care of yourself or have uncontrolled diabetes. I have not heard of many women getting GD this late...but it is possible. My advise is to call your Dr. and ask them to do a test. OR since you have several people in your family with diabetes, ask one of them to use a sterile lancet and check you with their glucose monitor. Do the test either first thing in the morning (fasting) or 2 hours after you eat. If your blood sugar is over 120-130...i would call the Dr as soon as possible.Good Luck!!!!XOXOXChristina",

            "answer": "the tingling you could be feeling may not be GD, but rather the baby...since you are at the stage you are....pressing on a nerve....especially since it happens when you sit and not all the time....try changing positions when you sit, or try to move the baby and see if it goes away.....regarding the thirst....you can get GD at a later date...so my suggestion would be to call the doctor and let them know that you can't seem to get enough water even though you drink quite a bit...Hang in there....its not too long now....",
