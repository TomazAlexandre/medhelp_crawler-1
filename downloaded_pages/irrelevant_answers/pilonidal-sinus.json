            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!You probably know by now that Pilonidal sinus are known for their recurrence. It is necessary to keep the area free of hair and infection. Laser pilation of hair in adjoining area is also necessary along with the surgery to close the sinus. If you are a smoker, you need to stop smoking to facilitate healing. Also check if you have diabetes. This could be the cause for low grade infection resulting in recurrence.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "On December 2006, I discovered that I have Pilonidal Sinus, and I went directly to the hospital and did an operation to remove the sinus. They did the operation and left the wound open, and did the dressing, but it seems that they haven\u2019t cleaned the wound very well, which let the sinus come again.On March 2007 I went to another hospital to make a new operation, and they made the surgery and opened a big hole, and left it open for dressing, then it took about 6 months till the wound got healed.On October 2007 the sinus came again, and I went to another doctor, and he made for me a laser treatment in order to close the wound, I went for dressing for 2 months, then the wound has closed.On January 2008, the sinus came again! So I went to a new hospital, and did the operation for me, and left the wound open, and I was going for dressing on regular basis, but the doctor informed me that my skin became very thin and it won\u2019t close very quickly. So, I kept going for dressing till September 2008, and the doctor informed me that it is healed 100%.Since then, the skin opens and closes from time to time, and some blood drops comes out, and whenever I go to my last doctor, he tells me it needs time to get healed, and this is normal because your skin is become too thin and it won\u2019t heal as it was the first time, and he confirmed to me that surgically nothing to be done, and we should wait till the wound close by itself.Honestly I became into a situation of not believing anybody, and I don\u2019t know what to do!Since January 2008, I am not sitting on my back as normal, and I try to sit on the side, but nothing has been changed.I was thinking into visiting a Dermatologist, as it is regarding skin thickness, and seriously I feel myself lost.Please help me as am my life became miserableBest Regards,Imad Abu Muhana",
