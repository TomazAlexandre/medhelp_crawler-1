    "question": "Is a guilty pleasure that they can catch you on!Haaaaahahaha.... so, I promised my awesome doc some tasty homemade treats for this weeks appointment (she knows that DH & I are both chefs.. with avid baking hobbies at home). I made a great batch of brown sugar fudge.. and just had to sample some as I was packing it up for her.\u00a0\u00a0I probably ate what can be considered to be a good sized piece (oh yes.. sugar is my friend) and hadn't eaten much else yet in the day.We walked straight down to the appointment and got in right away (first time for everything.. usually there's a 30 min. wait).\u00a0\u00a0Did the obligatory weight check (all's good) and the pee in a cup test.Got into the office room and had the standard little chat and handed over the fudge with much fanfare.\u00a0\u00a0The intern came in with the results of the pee test and seemed concerned... the doc read the paper and gave me a serious look..\"*ahem*.. did you perhaps sample this fudge before you came in today?\"We all laughed really hard as I said that I had.. a trace amount of sugar had shown up in the test that they regularly do for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0At this point I also admitted to popping handfuls of misc. candy into my mouth with breakfast, since DH got me a huge bag of candy (from our AMAZING local candy shop) for Valentines Day.. and I wanted it gone asap.\u00a0\u00a0:)So.. ladies.\u00a0\u00a0The morning of your appointments.. maybe steer a bit clear of massive sugar overloads.. unless your doc will be the recipient of some of this sugar too..\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0A less understanding doc might have given a lecture.. or flagged my chart for more blood tests.. :P",
