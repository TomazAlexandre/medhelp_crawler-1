            "answer": "Hello.Are you a diabetic ? Diabetes is a common cause of gastroparesis. I am sure your blood sugar levels were checked. But I was just wondering.It's a difficult situation when there is no 'case manager'. You may turn back to the good old physician with all the papers and ask him if he can manage it for you.I am not sure how the seizure has improved the stomach problems. But tonic clonic convulsions are known to increase the gastro - intestinal motility.Wish I could put in any more insights.Regards",

    "question": "47 Year old female -Chronic insomniac. Diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue in 1997, RLS in 2000. In 2002 I had 2 thoracic disc removed and I have gone through some chronic pain management (injections).I don't take any meds for pain as they make the insomnia worse. I had been treated for ADHD with ritalin from 1985 until 2005.\u00a0\u00a0March 2005 I was diagnosed with gastropareis and treated with Zelnorm until it was removed from the market.\u00a0\u00a0I can't take reglan and over the last couple of years I have learned to control the vomiting by limiting my diet.\u00a0\u00a0November 2007 I had my first tonic clonic seizure, I have had 3 more since then.\u00a0\u00a0After the first seizure I notice that MY gastroparesis had changed dramically.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the foods that I have not been able to digest for 2+ years I can now eat and I have not had any nausea since..\u00a0\u00a0After the first seizure, I had a MRI, MRA, CAT, all \"unremarkable\".\u00a0\u00a0The sleep deprived EEG showed spike waves in the left frontal and temporal lobes.\u00a0\u00a0I have auras before the seizures, ie bright flash of light in right eye, abdominal \"fluttering\", \"pin *****\" feeling in the right eye.\u00a0\u00a0I have found that I am allergic to Carbatrol and Depakote and am now taking Klonopin.\u00a0\u00a0My main question is that I feel that all these DX are related in some way, you know the \"zebra\" instead of the \"horse\", but I am having difficulty getting any one doctor to look at the total picture.\u00a0\u00a0Each condition is managed by a different specialist and I can't seem to peak any interest in the relationship of all. Now I am even questioning that I was ever ADHD or if I have been having \"mini\" seizures for a long time. I know that their is a connedtion between the vagus nerve, seizures and gstropareis but how do I figure this out. What is my next step?\u00a0\u00a0I am tired of having drugs thrown at me from each doctor and not being able to have a life.\u00a0\u00a0Any practical input would be helpful.ThanksMarty",
