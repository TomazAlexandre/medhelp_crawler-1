Mine didn't but I had it so many years it didn't present until Reactive Arthritis has destroyed my body and had a heart attack, diabetes, high cholesterol,gallstones and sludge.I had a bad tooth for so long and that's where the bacteria was coming from and setting up in my stomach and bloodstream.So destructive when left untreated. Doctors don't know a lot about arthritis that is RF Negative (doesn't show up in blood work)I hate I always seemed to find doctors that tell me why. I'm lucky I found one who tells me how.I was labeled as a pull seeker for over a decade because my blood work didn't show my silent symptoms",
