            "answer": "Well im not sure if an attack can kill her but she shouldnt wait to long to have it out. My mom waited years to have hers out and one day she ended up in the e.r. with a 50/50 chance of living it got so bad. It affected her pancreas and she still gets pains today even after the GB I gone. She was in the icu for a week and had to have the bile pumped out of her thru a nose tube. It was one of the worst things ever to see my mom go thru. And i cant imagine my child...And tests do show a diseased gallbladder..i never had the scope test though, i had the scan which showed my GB was diseased. Good luck i hope she gets the help she needs.",
