            "answer": "Go to your MD just to let them know but it's ok to have morning sickness as long as you have your vitamin liek the other poster said, take it at night. A lot of people have so much morning sickness that they lose weight, and it's still ok, as long as it doesn't keep happening. After about 10-12 weeks it should go away and then you should be fine and thats when it is a definite to start gaining weight, but at the beginning its ok. Call your MD and let them know you started it though just incase they want to put it in your chart. Good luck!",
