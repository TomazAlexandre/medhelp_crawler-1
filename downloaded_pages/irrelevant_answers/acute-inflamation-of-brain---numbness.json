            "answer": "Hi,Inflammatory disorders of the brain include brain abscess, meningitis, encephalitis and vasculitis. Since you do not have high fever and neck rigidity meningitis can be ruled out. It is quite possible that you are suffering from mild viral encephalitis. A CSF examination by lumbar puncture will help in diagnosis.The results of your LP should shed some light on the cause of your symptoms. When are you expecting them? Do keep me posted.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your answer - I am expecting them only on Wed. I was very frustrated that we could not get them earlier and do not understand the delay as if its a serious condition surely one needs to move asap? I understand the NHS are very busy but I would like to know what it is so that treatment can begin - very worried I will never feel \"normal\" again. I hope its this encephalitis as I am so healthy and fit and it is really so upsetting that suddenly my brain is inflamed. The numbness and pins and needles is fairly stong - well I can only be positive and also if it is MS then there are lots of drugs out there to help me lead a relatively normal life, so I am told.thank you so much - take care",

            "answer": "apologies - just one more question? So, could encaphilitis also not present in the blood? I am concerned as blood clear yet inflamation on brain and this numbness? I am hoping it is something else that is not as serious as MS. Thank you",

    "question": "Good morning - I\u00a0\u00a0woke up a week ago with complete pins and needles and numbness down one side of my body - admitted for MRI and inflamation of brain was picked up - also had lumbar puncture - no results yet. Am so afraid its MS - if not what else could this be? My blood appears clear.\u00a0\u00a0Would be so grateful for some advice or perhaps alternative reasons for these conditions.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you",
