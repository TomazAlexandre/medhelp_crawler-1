    "question": "tested positive for methadone at the pain doc today. Ofcourse i denied it due to the fact that , honestly, i wouldnt even know where to get it, let alone TAKE it.. currently on 4 diabetes meds, oxycontin,neurontin, BP\u00a0\u00a0and cholesterol meds . all of which they know about and have documented. After i tested positive i was in shock and was looked at as scum9 even though i've been there for 3 years with NO PRIOR PROBLEMS. I seriously have no idea what happened. she stated that they were going to send it to the lab to get further checked out. In the mean time she gave me the usual meds for 10 days as opposed to the usual 30 days. Is it possible that tylenol pm could be the culprit? will the lab be able to identify that i actually NEVER TOOK METHADONE? Now when it comes back negative i'll have to pay 2 co-pays instead of one. anyway of getting that 2nd co-pay re couped?....this is rediculous",
