            "answer": "Autino,Thanks for the post.The posterior descending (PDA) is usually a branch of the RCA, so it may be bypassed. Sometimes, the PDA orginates from the circumflex though so I cant be 100% sure. The 2nd marginal and PLCx are branches of the circumflex and must have been small, so they were not.The most important thing for small artery disease is very aggressive control ofcardiac risk factors such as diabetes, lipids, hypertension and smoking.\u00a0\u00a0With continued symptoms there are other drugs and therapies such as ranexa and eecp that are not as proven.good luck",
