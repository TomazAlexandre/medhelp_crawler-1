            "answer": "I've always been a diabetic but the most helpful thing for me has been going to this program for preggos with diabetes, sweet success. They set me up with a counselor to answer all my questions and pretty much educate me on what can happen to me and my baby girl and a dietician to give me tons of food ideas. Ask ur doctor if there is something similar you can be referred to. I'm in southern California. Google recipes there are actually a lot of good things to eat :) and DO exercise it helps bring ur sugars down so even when you can't help yourself and have a cookie it's not so bad. Best of luck!",

    "question": "I got the call today to confirm that I do have gestational diabetes. As a ftm I'm really worried about everything. I know it can be easily managed with diet and exercise, and most women go on to have safe deliveries and healthy babies. My only concern is that I'm an extremely picky eater. I don't like vegetables at all, but I love fruit. And I've read fruit can be bad with gestational diabetes. So my question is do you moms have and tips on how I can get the nutrients I need without veggies?",
