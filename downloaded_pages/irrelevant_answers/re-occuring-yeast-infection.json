Some people have no symptoms at all, while others get symptoms that can be easily mistaken for razor burn, pimples, bug bites, jock itch, hemorrhoids, an ingrown hair, or a vaginal yeast infection.\"",

            "answer": "Also I just read that the Herpes strain that causes cold sores can be transmitted to the genitals resulting in genital herpes!So if one of your gfs has had cold sores and gave you oral, then it could be transmitted. You should ask your doctor about a blood test in order to look for the antibodies.If you went to so many doctors, then surely one of them would have done a blood test. But in any case go to your doctor or the local health dept before you give this to someone else.",

    "question": "I have had a reoccurring yeast infection on my (circumsized)penis - generally starts near the base, scrotum, or crease of legs for about 4 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have been to 1 general practicioner, 1 male specalist, 2 dermatologists, and a urologist and they all pretty much say the same thing.\u00a0\u00a0They conclude I have a yeast infection and I should take something to treat it.\u00a0\u00a0I have taken nystatin, miconazle, and keteconazole for the problem but it always comes back.\u00a0\u00a0I always made sure to follow the directions and use the dose until it was out.\u00a0\u00a0If I stopped it would be fine for a month or more then it would come back and I would have to start treatment again.\u00a0\u00a0The best solution I have tried is wearing briefs and using baby powder or anti fungal powder.\u00a0\u00a0The only problem is I have to use powder twice a day.\u00a0\u00a0I can't even wear pants that fit me because pants that fit me exacerbate the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Is there something I can do to cut back on the yeast so I don't have to put medication or powder on my crotch everyday for the rest of my life and so I can wear clothes that actually fit?",
