    "question": "Hello Everyone.This forums has been a real sense of help for me to find questions to rising problems.My mother is 54 years. We regularly went for Hep ABC checkups. We were shocked when the report came positive with Hep C. My mother has many other problems such as Celiac Disease, Diabetes Mellitus and Thrombocytopenia.It was a tough decision that we have taken to go for Peg-Intron Drugs as she had Thrombocytopenia [Already lack of platelets] and we were sure the drugs reaction will even decrease the value of Platelets in body.Doctors advised to take on Peg-Intron 50mg and 80 mg alternatively ONE in a week.And by Gods grace, as all the praises remains to Allah swt, my mother PCR came negative i.e Undetectable before she had around 58 lac virals/ml.Oh and BTW doctors didnt go for her biopsy.I thought to share this story with you people since it will be helpful to motivate many. And yes.. The drugs had adverse side effects like Constant Fever, Fatigue and many others.Thank you all!Peace be upon all of you and above allPraises remains to Allah swt",
