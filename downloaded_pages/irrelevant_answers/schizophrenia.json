            "answer": "And for anyone reading this here there is a workshop on new medications in developmentthat I just found out about that is nationwide and worth signing up for (its free) to find out about the treatment of the future. I am on glycine, a study medication that promotes a full recovery without creating movement disorders or diabetes. The class of medication I take is called a glutamate antagonist. These medications are in development right now but when they come out they will be one of several classes of antipsychotics that will replace the current ones. Its important to keep updated on what's going on with ongoing research as everyone will be benefiting from it once it is finalized, in the same way I am now:http://www.narsad.org/help/campaign/publicannouncement.html",

            "answer": "A good way to find support groups is to speak to your local independent living center. They are run by people with disabilities for people with disabilities and believe in integrating people into the community but are in favor of mental health treatment and recovery. Mental health groups are good as well but as people move on in recovery its good to find overall disability support groups so that people can remain a part of the community at large as the mentality in some (not all of course) mental health groups can cause people to be self isolating or not value themselves. Here's a link to the independent living centers in the United States:http://www.ilusa.com/links/ilcenters.htm",
