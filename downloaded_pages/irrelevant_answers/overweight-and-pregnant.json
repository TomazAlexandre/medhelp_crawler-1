            "answer": "I was overweight to begin with but I watch what I eat now & make better choices. It's not just about getting back in shape after baby is born. It's important to gain weight steadily while pregnant. Gaining to much can make delivery harder & lead to high blood pressure & other problems for baby. I indulge my cravings but only have small amounts to offset the craving & not gain to fast. Even though people say you're eating for two you only need an extra 450-500 calories a day for a healthy baby. Talk with your doctor they can give you healthy alternitives too.",

            "answer": "It's possible @psrivs but you still have to watch what you eat because BF is only going to burn off so much. If you are taking in more than you're burning then you will continue to gain. You have to remember after you have a baby your metabolism slows down because of the hormones from pregnancy.",

            "answer": "I was around 250 pre-pregnancy and have lost almost 25lbs. I have gallstones though so I have been on a super restricted diet since I was 10 weeks bc they won't do surgery until post pregnancy. I wouldn't worry too much that you've gained weight, but there are obviously increased risks for having to have a c-section, gestational diabetes, preclampsia, and swelling. But if you just try to walk like half an hour a day that will tremendously help ya!! And like everyone else said, try to breastfeed, it burns somewhere between 300-500 extra cals :)",
