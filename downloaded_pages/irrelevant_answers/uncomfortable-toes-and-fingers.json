    "question": "My 16 year old daughter has been complaining that her toes are \"uncomfortable.\"\u00a0\u00a0She can't describe the feeling but says it is not tingling or numbness.\u00a0\u00a0She says that pressure or moving makes the feeling go away.\u00a0\u00a0This has been bothering her for several months and it is equal in both feet.\u00a0\u00a0It has gotten so bad that when she walks, she is constantly moving her toes and it is now hurting her entire foot. It bothers her more when she is sitting and laying down and she says she can't stand it.I thought it might be RLS even though she is so you and was going to take her to a podiatrist but she is now complaining that it is starting in her fingers and hands too.What kind of Dr. should she see for this?\u00a0\u00a0I have heard that anemia can cause this and have started giving her multi vitamins with iron to make sure she is not anemic but nothing seems to help.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas?",
