I'm also being induced this week but have in no way tried to bring anything on that isn't happening naturally, last thing I want is a stressed baby and an unnecessary complication!! Some ppl don't agree, yes I've suffered reflux, put on 13kg and had my fair share of complications in the last 40 wks including diabetes but doesn't mean I want to risk the life of my child or post a thousand times asking what works to get my baby out now!!",

    "question": "ok ladies we have been pregnant now for well over 35 weeks... Lots of posts from desperate ppl wanting babies out, I'm 40wks today and nothing happening either but I think everyone needs to calm down a bit and go with the flow... Think about what your potentially doing to yourself and Bub by trying to induce labour, causing undue stress and potential complications... You can't be pregnant forever, your baby will come! Good luck ladies x",
