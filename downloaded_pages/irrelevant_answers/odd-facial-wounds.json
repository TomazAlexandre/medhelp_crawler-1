            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If a scab forms and falls off on and off, then what you have is probably a non healing ulcer. This could be due to underlying infection, low supply of oxygen to the wound that is reducing the healing process, underlying diabetes, or due to underlying dermatitis.Wounds heal slower in diabetics or smokers or alcoholics who have been drinking for a long time. So these have to be ruled out.You need a culture sensitivity of wound scraping to know what antibiotics will suit the infection. If there is underlying dermatitis, then this needs to be taken care of. If there is severe atherosclerosis preventing blood supply to wound, then this needs to be diagnosed by angiograms.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
