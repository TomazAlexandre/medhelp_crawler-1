            "answer": "Hey there. Perhaps you can am you doctor to test you for gestating diabetes. Add you will know this is normality tested towards the latter end of the 2nd trimester or early third,\u00a0\u00a0but it is not uncommon for women to develop gestational diabetes early on. I have recently been diagnosed at 28 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0but believe I was suffering from it at 16 weeks.Of course,\u00a0\u00a0with all respect, you could have a weaker bladder having had previous pregnancies. Try pelvic floor exercises which should help strengthen your bladder, hopefully meaning you get some reprieve between toilet trips",

            "answer": "I tinkle about every 10-15 mins, but I also drink 8-20 oz of water every hour or two... Especially when I'm at work, I drink 80+ oz within 3 hours.. I'm constantly up and going to tinkle lol. So it's just changed slightly after becoming pregnant... But I naturally drink lots of water. And I balance my sodium intake so I'm not hurting myself taking in so much water.Now, if you're very thirsty and drinking more as a result of that, then it could be gestational diabetes like the other lady said",
