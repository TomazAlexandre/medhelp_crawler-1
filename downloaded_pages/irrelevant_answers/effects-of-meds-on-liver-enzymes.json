    "question": "I am curious, a family member has the gerds, and the diver (I forgot how to say the rest of that word). She also has kidney stones, hernia, some other stone, gall blader removed, diabeties, and Ill bet she is a tad over weight. Her diabeties is a mess with the highs and lows. her ac1 is greater than 12, she has highblood presure. Her liver enzymes are up, they took her of a statin...can the meds for gerds cause damage to her liver???? Can gerds ever be controlled by weight loss and diet for some?",
