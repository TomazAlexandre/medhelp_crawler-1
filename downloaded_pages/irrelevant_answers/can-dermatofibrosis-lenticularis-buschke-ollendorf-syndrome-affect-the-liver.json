            "answer": "Hi there, I only know that in many cases it is asymptomatic, meaning that it doesn't affect the patient adversely...it is genetic disorder, and is manifested in lesions on skin and various parts of body...perhaps what he was checking for and will be testing for is for diabetes, as when this condition is found along with Buschke-Ollendorf Syndrome then it is very serious. Of course, in that case if there is diabetes present then it could affect the liver, likley he was feeling for evidence of inflammation in perhaps the pancreas, which is near the liver, or the liver and organs of the abdomen itself.There is quite a bit of information on this and it would perhaps answer a lot more effectively your questions, as most of us here are not drs, only people who have an interest in medicine or have disorders and conditions that have\u00a0\u00a0brought us here as well.Hope you find the answers you need and best wishes for your son.",
