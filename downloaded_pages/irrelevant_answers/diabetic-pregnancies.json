            "answer": "all i can tell you is that i'm the second daughter of a diabetic. my mother only had the 2 of us and i know that she definitely had difficult pregnancies, but we were both healthy and well Thank G-d. After she had my sister the doctor told her she shouldn't have any more kids, but she really wanted and after 5 years she had me - i was 6 weeks early - little, but my mother was a fighter so i guess i had all her fight in me. i know she was on bed rest for a lot of the pregnancy and it wasn't easy, but it did happen. I also know she had a few miscarriages (for sure before my sister and i'm not sure if in between the two of us), but then again who knows if they were from the diabetes or not. i'm not diabetic (Thank G-d) and have had 2 m/c already so maybe it had nothing to do with it for her. Also this is 25/26 years ago so with all the stuff they know now i wouldn't be surprised if it's much easier. Hope all is well with you. Good Luck.",

            "answer": "I am not diabetic but I know two mothers with type 1 diabetes, each had two healthy pregnancies & the children are fine. One even carried twin boys over 36 weeks with no complications. All of the children were born healthy & no problems known (the oldest of all these is 7 now) I don't know all the risks, but I've seen these positive experiences. :-)",
