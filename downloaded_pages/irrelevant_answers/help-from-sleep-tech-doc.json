    "question": "Can anyone (sleep tech or doc) help me with a few crazy questions? I'm a sleep technologist and have been one for 13 years....I'm having a hard time getting an answer to these even from the med director here....any good tips for determining if it's plms or very small RERAs; I'm not talking about obvious ones, I mean where it could go either way easily. Looking for tips b/c my med dir doesn't believe in them, but I do of course. Also, any info on arousal indices- for PLMs what's considered mild/mod/severe sleep frag TECHNICALLY (not just by obvious observations)? I've dealt with this stuff for years obviously, but it's all changed SO much over the years (No RERAs when I started!). Just trying to get updates. Thanks!",
