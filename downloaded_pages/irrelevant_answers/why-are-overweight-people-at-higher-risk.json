            "answer": "Some scientists say that fat should be considered as a separate organ, considering the impact it has on hormone systems in the body.Putting it very simplistically ; Fat contributes towards insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin resistance means that insulin levels need to be much higher than for a relatively slimmer person, in order for the sugars to be absorbed.This is one of the reasons that overweight people with diabetes are recommended to lose weight.For obese people, who are diabetic, and lose weight, their diabetes may be apparently reversed (though the tendency for diabetes is still there and it may return if they gained weight again)..",

            "answer": "Like diabetes86 says, not all fat people get diabetes.Being fat not only puts you at risk of getting diabetes, but also from getting other illnesses, like heart disease and more strain on the bones causing damage to the weight bearing joints.What you say is technically true, but when the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or too much insulin but your body has become resistant to it, the glucose stays attached to the red corpuscles and does not get pushed to the body cells that need the energy.Our western diet exposes us to too much temptation with lots of foods that we overload our bodies.\u00a0\u00a0Having said that even with no overload does not mean that you won't get diabetes, because it can be genetic.For example if you have a parent or close family members who have diabetes, you will be more at risk at getting the illness.Imagine the glucose as being the fuel in the engine of a car.\u00a0\u00a0The fuel is useless until the engine is turned on.\u00a0\u00a0The fuel won't be used properly or efficiently if you have blocked filters, or bad spark plugs.\u00a0\u00a0Same for the body.\u00a0\u00a0If the pancreas does not produce enough insulin then the energy is not pushed to the cells that need it.\u00a0\u00a0If the pancreas produces enough insulin but your body doesn't utilise it properly its like the filters in the car are damaged.Fat cells do not need glucose or energy.\u00a0\u00a0Fat cells are made when there is too much energy that is not being burned off.\u00a0\u00a0Your car full of fuel in the tank, but it won't be used until you turn the engine on.\u00a0\u00a0Your body won't burn the fat or energy until you exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Some energy is used to help the body function, but any excess of food that you eat or drinks full of calories, will be stored as fat.\u00a0\u00a0To burn body fat, you need to move and exercise more or eat less food (fuel).Hope that, in a simple way, can help you understand about it a bit more.",

            "answer": "Ok let me see if I get it in a non-scientific kind of way.A person eats an unhealthy diet with lots of carbs, at the same time leading a sedintery lifestyle. For a while his body produces enough insulin to absorb all the glucose, but then his body doesn't utilize it so it gets stored as fat.Then one day the body says: 'wait a minute we are not using all this glucose, so lets not respond to all this insulin that is coming our way' and starts building insulin resistance.

            "answer": "Yep, sort of.In Type 2 diabetes, the pancreas either does not produce enough insulin or it produces the insulin, but your body has become insulin resistant.When you have Type 2 diabetes, sometimes it does not end up as a \"downwards spiral\".\u00a0\u00a0The reason to stop it spiralling down is by eating smaller portions, but with a few hours in between.\u00a0\u00a0Not have large meals with desserts and puddings.\u00a0\u00a0And also by exercising.\u00a0\u00a0Exercise burns energy (what we call calories - eat too many calories (too much energy), it gets stored as fat.If you eat a lot and sit at the computer or watch the telly all the time (couch potato), you gain weight because you are eating too much energy, but that energy is not being used, so gets stored as fat.\u00a0\u00a0Being very overweight is not good if you want to stay healthy and well.\u00a0\u00a0Some thin people get diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0And it may be that their pancreas is not working properly (which no one knows why) or it may be\u00a0\u00a0hereditary - if any of your parents or family members have diabetes, our risk is that much higher of getting it if you do not look after your health and weight.Sometimes the pancreas stops working altogether and doesn't produce any insulin.\u00a0\u00a0This is called Type I diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It can happen at any age, but usually in young children.\u00a0\u00a0People with Type I diabetes have to have an injection of insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin is the hormone that is produced by the pancreas to help get the glucose to the cells in the body, without insulin the glucose sits in the blood which causes a glucose overload.",
