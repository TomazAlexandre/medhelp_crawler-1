            "answer": "Hmmm! I'm wondering if the clots you're describing is just normal period clots...because if you still had tissue remaining, you wouldn't get your periods. I have a feeling you're OK, but having a doctor check it out would probably not be a bad idea. So sorry about your loss.",

Chromosome problems account for approximately 50 percent of all miscarriages. About 95 percent of the time, the parents' chromosomes are normal and the genetic abnormality has developed as a one-time error in the fetus. In such cases, miscarriage is the body's way of ending a pregnancy that is not developing normally.Miscarriages also can happen if there are problems with the internal structure of a woman's uterus or the strength of her cervix. For example, some women are born with a uterus that has a thick membrane (septum) extending through its middle. This can nearly or completely divide the womb into two chambers, and a uterus with this shape may not hold a pregnancy securely. A woman's cervix, which should open during labor and delivery to allow the fetus to pass through, is sometimes too weak to keep the fetus safe inside the womb until delivery. When the cervix is too weak and opens early in pregnancy, it is called an incompetent cervix. Problems with the structure of the uterus and an incompetent cervix are the two most common causes of miscarriage during the first part of the second trimester (12 to 20 weeks).Other causes of miscarriage include infections and hormonal imbalances. In rare cases, a woman's immune system rejects the fetus, or antibodies from the immune system cause problems with blood flow in the placenta. Immune-system disorders are responsible for miscarriages in 5 percent to 10 percent of women who have had 3 or more miscarriages in a row. One fairly common antibody problem that can lead to miscarriage is called antiphospholipid antibody syndrome.Women with diseases such as poorly controlled diabetes or severe hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid) are at higher risk of miscarriage. Having rubella (German measles) during early pregnancy has been associated with miscarriage. Environmental factors, such as smoking cigarettes and drinking alcoholic beverages during pregnancy, may increase your risk of having a miscarriage. Miscarriage is not caused by regular physical activities, minor accidents, exercise, sexual intercourse, or minor stumbles or falls.",
