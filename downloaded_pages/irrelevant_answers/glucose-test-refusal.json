I would say you have every right to have someone else who actually knows whay they are doing. I would not suggest refusing to take the the test though. Gestastional diabetes are pretty serious, and you need to know whether you have them or not so your baby is safe!",

            "answer": "Personally I wouldn't refuse the test I would just make sure that nurse didn't try to take my blood again I would just let them know that you are nervouse about the blood draw if they could get someone who is really good at taking blood to do yours because if you were to have diabetes that can have serious side effects for you and your child if its not managed properly during your pregnancy a lot worse than a bad blood draw",

            "answer": "Honestly you should take the test. Its safer for you and baby.What I suggest is when you take the test, ask for an experienced nurse NOT a student and explain why. If they don't get you one then refuse to have your blood drawn.I have jumpy veins, so every time my blood is drawn I tell them you have three tries. Once in each arm and a butterfly needle in the hand.I'm petrified of needles btw, I have panic attacks and my fiance even has had to restrain and hold me so the nurse could get the needle in. I've fainted many times in his arms, pregnant and not.",

            "answer": "Wow, not a great experience! But unfortunately the test is really important. I'm overweight and my first baby was huge but no gd, my neighbour on the otherhand is tiny and thought she ate healthy yet had insulin dependent gd. You just don't know how those hormones are going to effect you and bub.",

Took about a minute. Unless they are doing other tests along with gestational diabetes, that should be an option for you.",

    "question": "Hey everyone I'm a first time mom,i recently went in for my glucose test about a week ago aand everything went horribly wrong. I drank the juice and waited a hour, finally about to get my bblood drawn by a \"student nurse\". As she's digging around in my arm she doesn't get any blood in the test tube and I faint. Waking up they gave me juice, completely ruining the test.So now im 29 weeks and they want to do the test on me again.\u00a0\u00a0Mind you I have terrible anxiety and am on the verge of a panic attack every time I think about it.\u00a0\u00a0Is there any other moms that refuse this test?\u00a0\u00a0Cause I really don't think I can take it again with how frightened I am.",
