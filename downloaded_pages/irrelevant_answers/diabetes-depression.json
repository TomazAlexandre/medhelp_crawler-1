            "answer": "Hi, sorry to hear how bad you are feeling.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like your body has built up a tolerance to your amytriptyline, this is very common and is why your depression has returned.\u00a0\u00a0Don't stop the medication call your doctor and go from there.\u00a0\u00a0This is when we are normally switched to a different one. The low blood sugar will not make you depressed, but just dealing with the diabetes can.\u00a0\u00a0If you have been taking good care of yourself it may be that your diabetes has improved, and you may not need as much medication and/or insulin, which is good!\u00a0\u00a0Can you tell us just how low your sugar is?\u00a0\u00a0I would call your Endo about this, some people have been able to stop their diabetes medication thru proper nutrition, weight control and exercise. Call both your doctors so you can get some relief from the depression and to discuss with your Endo your low glucose readings.\u00a0\u00a0I too, get more depressed during the holidays but your medication should keep it from taking you down that far.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you all the best, everything will be fine.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.",

            "answer": "I am a diabetic too and am unresolved about the low blood sugar/depression syndrome. I know that the sugar rush will make you feel better regardless of diabetes and tend to have a candy bar or two when this happens.I am not advocating this as a long term solution but it has helped me in the past between medication adjustments.",
