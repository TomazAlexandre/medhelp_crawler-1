    "question": "can you please explain to me what this means in a term that i will understand what is going to happen to me,this is from my discharge papers,there is a prominent high signal focus in the subcortical white matter of left parietal lobe (centrum semiovale region). there is another focus in the white matter of the posterior right frontal lobe at the level of frontal horns of lateral ventricals. Further 3 punctiform high signal foci are noted in the subcortical white matter of parietal lobes one on the right side and two on the left side. All these\u00a0\u00a0foci show restricted diffusion on dwi with correspondinding bright signal on adc, thought to reflect ischaemic foci related to miicroangiopathy.i have no idea what this all means, i need to understand.thank you",
