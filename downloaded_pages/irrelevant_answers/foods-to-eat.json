    "question": "Hey guys! So im currently 5 weeks along (pretty early still) but I have an issue with gaining weight. I had this issue before getting pregnant, but im more concerned about it now. As of yesterday I weighed 117, when normally my weight stays about 125.What are foods that I can eat that will help me gain and keep it as well as still be good for the baby?Also, what would be the best way to ensure im eating enough throughout the day, and not just a couple \"meals for two\" and then snacks in between?",
