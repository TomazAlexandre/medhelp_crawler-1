    "question": "For the last few weeks, I have had symptoms of urinary urgency every so often that has been increasing in intensity. I am a 22 y/o woman. Before this month, I rarely ever had any urinary problems.Last week, I had one incident where I had the sudden urge to go to the bathroom and had to bolt out of class. I \"leaked\" a little bit of urine even before I had the chance to go. After that, my symptoms of urgency and frequency increased about 10 fold.I went to my student health center and they performed an urinalysis. It was negative for WBC but they still gave me Cipro 500mgx 3 days. They said it was possible for my urine to be diluted and be - for WBCs if I had been drinking a lot of fluids. (I was)My symptoms have gotten better but now I have the problem of \"leaking\" some urine throughout the day. The symptoms of urgency/frequency are not as intense as they were. My bladder can't seem to hold a lot of urine. This is quite embarassing considering my age.I don't have to wake up at night to urinate nor do I have any accidents at night.I am going back to my student health center to also have them check me for STD's and other infections such as BV and a yeast infection.It is important to note my symptoms seemed to increase the more 12-hours shifts I started working as a nurse. I am about to graduate with my 4 year nursing degree.Do you have any suggestions as to what to do? It is a total confidence downer when you \"leak\" urine and you're only 22 years old and have never had these sorts of problems before.Thank you.",
