            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes of these white spots. It would be best to consult your doctor with your parents to find out the cause in your case and plan the further management accordingly.Some of the perceived causes are emotional stress, hereditary factors, worms, sunburns and physical illness. This skin condition can be aggravated due to diseases like hyperthyroidism, diabetes mellitus, pernicious anemia and Addison's disease.Fungal infections of the human body are very common, and are often quite bothersome. One such example is a condition known as tinea versicolor, a superficial yeast infection that produces white spots on the skin that are difficult to remove.You should talk to your doctor and rule out the above causes.Let us know if you need any other information.Regards.",

            "answer": "HiIf it's the same as what I have...the condition is called Bier's Spots.I have had exactly the same thing since about the age of 7 and it's NOT a dermatalogical (skin) disorder it's a Vascular (circulatory) issue. This is to say that the problem, and therefore remedy, is with the arteries, veins and capillaries that supply the skin with blood, and not the actual dermis of the skin itself. This is why I don't advise going to see a dermatologist about it, as their specialty is based on the skin, and this issue goes far deeper. It's a SYMPTOM of a vascular issue, so really you need to go and see a vascular specialist who will be able to investigate exactly why this is happening.I hope you get a chance to read this, as I see your comment was from ages ago :)Sophie Xx",
