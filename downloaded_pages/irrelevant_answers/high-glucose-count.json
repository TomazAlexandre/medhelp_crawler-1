            "answer": "And what is your question?It is obvious you have to see your physician and follow his/her instructions to the letter to control the glucose.High blood pressure? That is a meaningless statement. How high? What is the heart rate? What is your age?I don't mean to be flippant but from your statement there is little to comment on.",

            "answer": "I don't mean to be sarcastic.220 is not an unreasonable measurement to be taken after eating a meal, for example.And is the reading taken after taking medication and if so, what medication?As far as blood pressure goes, it it compensatory, or idiopathic?ALS is another terrible disease, but not necessarily related to either blood pressure or glucose. If you are on prednisone a higher level of insulin is required to maintain the same glucose levels, for example.You would best have your records reviewed by a local registered nurse or physician's assistant if your primary care provider won't take the time to do so.",
