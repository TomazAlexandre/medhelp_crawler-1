            "answer": "Hello,Lupus can involve multiple organs and when it involves the peripheral nerves then it can cause numbness and tingling of the fingertips and hands. But at the same time other causes need to be ruled out which include lack of blood supply to the peripheries as a result of plaque formation in the blood vessels, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid, abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12.You can take multivitamins for some time. Also get your blood sugar tested.My opinion is to get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
