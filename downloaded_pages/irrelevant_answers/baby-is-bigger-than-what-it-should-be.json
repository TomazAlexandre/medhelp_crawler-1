            "answer": "It's pretty common for some babies to measure a wk or 2 bigger I'm 20wks and my baby measures 22wks but everything is fine, the glucose test doesn't have anything to do with the baby been big or not and gestational diabetes is for the mom not the baby that's why it usually goes away after birth. Don't worry it might be a good thing your baby is a little big :)",

            "answer": "I am measuring a week ahead now. But usually if you had a negative result with the glucose test they would call you or have you come back in so dont stress about it. Mt sister in law had a big baby and her glucose came out fine! He was born at 10 lbs .5oz he was a big boy basically a little man! And no diabetes problems!",

    "question": "Yesterday I went for my 18-20 week ultrasound (the measure all body parts etc) i was exactly 18 weeks yesterday this is according to when I had my 6 weeks ulstrasound. I'm due the 2nd March but my tech was measuring my babies head and everything else and it was saying 19 weeks + 5 days (that's nearly 2 weeks in advance). My tech said the baby is bigger than it should be at 18 weeks. I had my Gloucouse test a week ago and I still can't get hold of my Dr for my results. Could this mean my baby is 19 weeks + 5 days or it might mean I have Gestional Diabetes because of the size of the baby? I'm hoping bub is 19 weeks + 5 days, has anyone else had this problem with the wrong due date etc..?",
