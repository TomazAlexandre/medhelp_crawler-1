GLUCOPHAGE has not been studied in children younger than 10 years old.GLUCOPHAGE has not been studied in combination with other oral glucose-control medicines or insulin in children. If you have any questions about the use of GLUCOPHAGE in children, talk with your doctor or other healthcare provider.GLUCOPHAGE XR has not been studied in children.I ALSO FOUND THIS:Glucophage",

            "answer": "I'm also not a physician, but a long-time diabetic.If your child is overweight, then she is at risk for Type 2 diabetes and Glucophage may help.\u00a0\u00a0Perhaps this is the case, since it's unusual for normal-weight children to have a nutrition doctor.For a child of normal or near-normal weight, there is not usually a risk for Type 2 diabetes.As was posted already, it's important that any person who's borderline or diabetic be followed by an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Endocrinologists are physicians who specialize in treating diabetes and other diseases of the endocrine system.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes these specialists are called diabetologists.It's important to be followed by a specialist because there are many details in managing this disease, and \"general\" physicians may not be current on the recommended treatments and the prevention & testing techniques for complications.Even if you need to push your health care system, do it so make sure your daughter gets the best possible care.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is not easy to learn about and manage, but it is manageable when we keep at it and come to places like this for support & information.",
