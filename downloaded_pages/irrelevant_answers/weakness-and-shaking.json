            "answer": "well this could be the hypoglycemia, i too have it but dont often have symptoms because i eat constantly and eat candy often. but i am no doctor so you should definately ask your doctor about it. hypoglycemia seems to be thought of as not serious, but in fact its just as serious as diabetes, and also can progress like diabetes. you may have been told this 5 years ago but it may have progressed to a higher level. it could be worse. you need to have your doctor check your blood sugar levels. and if its not the hypoglycemia then you need to find out what it is. good luck to you and take care",
