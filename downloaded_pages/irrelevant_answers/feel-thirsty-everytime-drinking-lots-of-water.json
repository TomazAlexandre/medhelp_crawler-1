            "answer": "The symptoms that you are describing and especially the unquenchable thirst is a very typical sign of Diabetes.Please make an appointment with your doctor as soon as possible to get checked out.\u00a0\u00a0Take a urine sample with you when you go to see your doctor as you may also have a urinary infection (these can also make you feel fatigued and cause memory problems through the infection).A urine dip stick test will confirm whether you have a urinary infection and/or diabetes if the sugar level is very high.A more accurate Diabetes check is through having a blood test taken.Don't delay making an appointment to get checked out, because Diabetes undetected can cause damage to nerves and cause diabetic retinopathy (damage to the inside of the eye that can lead to blindness).Let us know how you get on.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "You can buy on line Urine Reagent Strips quite cheaply.\u00a0\u00a0There are some that test the urine just for glucose, but they do not give an accurate recording of how much sugar there is in the blood stream.\u00a0\u00a0These sticks are a good indicator, but they will only detect glucose in the urine if there is above a certain level (fairly high) of glucose in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0An HbA1c blood test shows average blood glucose levels over a sustained period (about a 3 month period).\u00a0\u00a0Rather than a normal blood test that would only show the sugar levels at the time you gave your blood for testing.I buy the 10LG Parameter Urine Reagent Strips that can detect a few abnormalities by dipping the strip into a sample of urine, Leukocytes, Nitrite, Urobilinogen, Protein, pH, Blood, Specific Gravity, Ketone, Bilirubin, Glucose.\u00a0\u00a0There is a coloured chart on the container that you compare your urine strip test to after waiting for the appropriate amount of time as indicated on the container.You can buy monitors and strips, but I would not advise you to do that, because initially all you need at the moment is to find out if you do have diabetes or not and get the right information and medication (if needed) on how to control it.\u00a0\u00a0The monitors are for people who already have diabetes to help them to monitor and their check sugar levels.It may be worth you asking your pharmacist if they do blood tests for diabetes or a glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0We have that in some pharmacies in the UK.The worst that can happen with diabetes is kidney failure and death, peripheral nerve damage, lack of blood circulation that may lead to gangrene and amputation, diabetic retinopathy that can lead to blindness.Loss of sensations in your private area and other digits due to nerve damage, painful feet.\u00a0\u00a0You may find more on the web.To help yourself, in the event that you may have diabetes is to cut out all refined and processed foods that contain sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Eat complex carbohydrates that give you slow release energy and not the refined stuff like cakes, chocolate, white bread etc. that will give you a surge of energy and then will slump quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid junk foods.\u00a0\u00a0Eat small meals regularly, rather than a large meal.\u00a0\u00a0You can find lots of information on the web on diet to help control diabetes.If there is already damage in the eyes (you may have not even noticed), the optician can detect changes in the retina when you have an eye test.Take care with your diet, because the sugar levels in the blood can also drop dramatically making you hypoglycaemic.\u00a0\u00a0Too much sugar in the blood stream with the thirst and other symptoms of felling weird could be hyperglycaemia.Cut down on the amount of salt you use too, as this can make you feel very thirsty as well.I am glucose intolerant (not a diabetic) and already have peripheral nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0So nerve damage can happen slowly a long time before you get diagnosed with diabetes.Do you have any free medical centres that you could see someone about your unquenchable thirst that could do a blood test for you?Let me know how you get on.Wishing you well.",
