            "answer": "Has her adrenal gland function been checked? Sometimes the autoimmune system not only destroys the pancreas, but it can also destroy other endocrine glands. My twin found after years of fatigue and low blood pressure episodes that her adrenal function is low. While she does produce adrenalin, it is in either too small or sometimes too\u00a0\u00a0big amounts, for her adrenal glands don't seem to function normally. Symptoms are fatigue, a heart and pulse racing feeling when she is dumping too much adrenalin, low blood pressure to the point of passing out if she gets sick, and depression is also one of the symptoms. It might be worth testing for.",

    "question": "I have a few questions I'm asking on behalf of a friend's 29-year-old daughter with well controlled juvenile diabetes and celiac disease, who is currently hospitalized with severe autonomic dysfunction--low blood pressure (70/40 on admission), incoherence (especially upon awakening in the morning, and often difficult to arouse), dizziness, lack of muscle tone--which she has developed over the past few months.I have limited but possibly helpful knowledge of her situation.\u00a0\u00a0She is on an insulin pump.\u00a0\u00a0Her tilt test was positive.\u00a0\u00a0 Her cardiac workup was negative--no heart issues suspected. She has gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0I believe she's been tested for Lyme's disease (negative).\u00a0\u00a0Hospitalization with IV electrolytes seems to stabilize her and make her feel better.\u00a0\u00a0She reverts to the same kind of dysfunction almost immediately after discharge.\u00a0\u00a0 She is taking Lyrica (or something like that) for severe foot neuropathy/pain. When it was withdrawn briefly, the pain returned immediately.\u00a0\u00a0 She was taking birth control pills for recurrent ovarian cysts, but the pills made her sugar levels go crazy and her mood unstable, so they have been stopped.\u00a0\u00a0She has seen a psychiatrist due to depression about all this, but an emotional cause for the physical issues is not suspected in her case.\u00a0\u00a0Nevertheless, a cause has not been specifically identified, and the family doesn't even know what kind of doctor to talk to at this point.\u00a0\u00a0They are feeling desperate and need answers.Here are my questions for you:1.\u00a0\u00a0What are the possible causes of these autonomic symptoms?2.\u00a0\u00a0What treatments should be considered?3.\u00a0\u00a0What kind of doctor should be in charge of this case?4.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know a superior diagnostician, or clinic in the New York area specializing in difficult to diagnose cases?\u00a0\u00a0(She lives in Westchester County.)Thanks so much for any help you can offer.wlew",
