Also diabetes runs in my family so I am super nervous! So you ended up passing yours after 3 hours? What did your doctor say about that?",

            "answer": "No I still haven't took my three hour one yet. I wanted to know if anyone passed the three hour after failing the one hour. The nurse was concerned because I hadnt ate anything for 12 hours and it was that high just from the glucose drink. I'm so devastated because I am not over weight and I thought I was having a smooth pregnancy.",

            "answer": "Typically you're not supposed to fast before the glucose test. I ate right up until I drank the glucose drink and my 1 hour BG result was 58. I had the early test and will have it again at 28 weeks cause they always think I am diabetic cause my babies are so big. It's a good idea to watch your sugar and carb intake anyway. Good luck on your test.",

The nurse seemed concerened bc it was so high and I hadn't ate. Has anyone failed the one hour with a high number and passed the three hour. I'm scared to do a diet. I work at taco bell and don't have healthy food in my house.",
