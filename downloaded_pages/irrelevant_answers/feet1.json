            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Generally these types of swellings are callus formation. This occurs due to wrong pressure. Faulty foot wear\u2014footwear not suiting your feet, wrong posture and prolonged standing cause this. This is called a \u201ccorn\u2019 in general terms. Several adhesive caps are available which you can apply over them and which will remove these corns. Sometimes these cannot be removed easily and need surgical intervention. Diabetes too result in repetitive corns.Hope this helps. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining",
