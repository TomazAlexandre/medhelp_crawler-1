If I'm just sitting in class, or whatever I'm doing, sometimes my heart starts racing, almost feels as if it skips beats or theres extra beats, and I shake. went to the doctor a long time ago for it and they said it was a virus and it will go away, but it did, then came back.",

    "question": "For the past week in a half, a lot of the time I feel like I have to use the bathroom, but when I go, nothing.\u00a0\u00a0It happens a lot, and it has gotten me so confused of whether I have to use the bathroom or not. Although I highly doubt it being a bladder infection( I go through 1-2 big bottles of cranberry juice a week). Also, I used to be able to eat a lot, and I mean a lot. I still feel the same hunger, but when I eat, I can barely eat anything, I get full so fast, almost feeling full all the time even if I'm hungry. And I know this sounds like a lot but also for some reason(not sure why) my heart starts racing, beating really hard, I get shaky, dizzy, lightheaded, that deal, and I'm not sure what's causing that either. So I know I loaded this post with a lot of questions about my health, I just don't have the time to post all my questions separately, but to anyone who can give me some advice or comments about what they think, I would really appreciate that!!",
