            "answer": "thanks for the help.ok so my doctor said that the drug test showed nothing abnormal and that everything seems fine. She said it does not sound as though i have diabetes but i can get the fasting test anyway. I plan to do it next week. However, today i noticed that there are these two brown spots on my groin/anus area. The one is on the very upper part of my thigh more near the anus and the other is right next to it but between the testis and anus. What could this indicate? Please if a doctor could also respond i would really appreciate it!",

    "question": "Ok so i am a 20 year old male. In June i noticed that my urethra was inflammed and didnt know what to think so i went to the doctor and got tested for syphilis ghonorea and chlamydia and uti all came back negative. I then went to another doctor to get more tests done i got the same ones and hiv and all were negative. I am now having symptoms of side pain in the lower back area front and back and it goes up to the bottom of my ribs. Also i have had kinda unfocused vision. My feet burn and tingle sometimes. I just went to another doctor who thought it might be anemia and she did a blood test and said it was normal and that it wasnt anything immune wise. I then went to an eye doctor who said my eyes were ok but i still get bad vision sometimes. Another thing i have noticed is that my veins seem to be enlarged in some places like my wrists and shaft of my penis. if anyone has any clues about this please let me know. Thanks",
