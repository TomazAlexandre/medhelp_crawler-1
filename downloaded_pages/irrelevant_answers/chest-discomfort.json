Took all the test (ecg, 2d echo, stress) and almost two and half years back and everything came normal. Cholestrol levels are good, no diabetes. Gastroenterologist prescribed HP Kit after taking endoscopy. The pain got relieved for a few months (actually started in July 2009). The same started this March 2010 and still continuing. BP is normal. Also chest xray is normal. The gastroenterologist gave as moderate oesophagitis and mild gastritis. After taking Rabiprazole i am not having a relief. Again got aggrevated in June 2011 and took chest xray and ECG, both were normal and even cholestrol and sugar were normal. Cardio said some issue in the muscle contraction.
