            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!First of all consult a good urologist and find out why he has redness at the tip of penis. Infection, UTI, prostatitis, STD can all be the possibilities. Get his sleep pattern checked by sleep studies, and look for diabetes as the possible cause to his problems.His problems could be due to heartburn too. OK here are a few tips for you. Try them. If they do not help, consult an internal medicine specialist. However, you must consult an urologist.Do deep breathing exercises and regular walk for 20-30 minutes. Take OTC omeprazole 20mg empty stomach everyday along with OTC antacids during the day. Avoid too much of caffeine, tea, fried food and drinks both alcoholic and non alcoholic fuzzy ones. Avoid heavy exercises within 4 hours of a heavy meal. Raise the head end of the bed by pillows to 30 degrees. Go to bed at least 2 hours after food.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "My friend is 22. Sometimes after he goes to bed, he wakes up in panic and having rapid heartbeat and with one or both arms numb. Sometimes he gets very dizzy. He once woke up and couldn't get out of bed due to feeling too nauseated. During the day he feels weak, irritable and depressive and has problems concentrating, he describes it as having \"emptiness of mind\". He has heartburn and hiccups often, as well (not suure if hiccups are any relevant, but ah well). He experiences a frequent need to urinate (3 times in an hour today, for example), even though he doesn't consume a lot of liquids. He has redness and sometimes soreness of his penis tip. I think he often gets hypoglycemia, though eating sweets when he gets so nauseous doesn't really help much.he isn't on any medication, but he spends a lot of time indoors, at the computer, doesn't really get exercise or a healthy diet or has regular sleep hours...I would appreciate any help in finding out what these symptoms indicate. Thank you.",
