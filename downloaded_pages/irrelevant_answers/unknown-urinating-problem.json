I do think I have Insipidus because I don't have an extreme thrist for ice cold water, although I do like my water ice cold. By drinking luke warm water, I have the sensation as though I'm about to pass out. Anyway, it hopes this gives some insight. Thanks for the possible suggestions.",

    "question": "For the past year, I have had the contant urge to urinate and do so about every 1 to 2 hours at best. I am a 30 year old male, no typical symptoms relating to UTI, OAB, and Enlarged Prostate. This only occurs during daytime hours or night, when I'm working overnights at my job. If I'm sitting down, can do about 3 hours without urinating. Also, oddly enough, after ejaculation, I have to urinate. This can be brought on regardless of how much I drink (soda or water). So far, cannot find a reason for this. Can anyone suggest a cause?",
