            "answer": "This sounds like a case of neurogenic bladder.\u00a0\u00a0Unless the cause is found, it is unlikely that medication can be helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Any infection should be evaluated for, and treated if found.\u00a0\u00a0Prophylactic medications can be considered if chronic infection is found.I am not familiar with the data with the electronic stimulator for treatment of neurogenic bladder.Intermittent catherization can be an option.\u00a0\u00a0Another consideration would be placement of a permanent suprapubic catheter.These options can be discussed with your personal physician or urologist.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only. Please see your personal physician for further evaluation of your individual case.Kevin, M.D.http://www.straightfromthedoc.com",

    "question": "I am 52 year old male who has diabetes insipidus due to a brain tumor I had on my pituitary gland at the age of 14.\u00a0\u00a0I feel I drink much more than most people and therefore urinate more often.\u00a0\u00a0I have always gotten up several times at night to relieve myself.\u00a0\u00a0Recently, I saw a urologist who says that I am retaining fair amounts of urine after urinating.\u00a0\u00a0He says that my bladder is not voiding because it has been stretched and has lost its elasticity due to my holding my urine for long periods.\u00a0\u00a0He did a procedure on me to vaporize my prostate gland thinking that was a cause.\u00a0\u00a0(Did he vaporize all or part of it?)\u00a0\u00a0Now due to the fact I am still not voiding completely, he says I must catheterize myself several times daily to cut the risk of infection due to urine left in my bladder.Can this be true or is their some medicine I can take to help my bladder void itself?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any suggestions you have to help me with this problem?I have read about a electronic stimulator (Medtronic) that helps persons with urinary retention void their bladders.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think this is worth looking into?Any help for this problem would be appreciated.Also, whether or not it helps, I have Parkinson's Disease which was finally diagnosed in April after many years of seeing doctors due to a foot drop symptom.",
