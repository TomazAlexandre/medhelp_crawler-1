            "answer": "The problem with dry food and diabetes is tha certain grains cause a blood sugar spike and then drop which is hard to regulate blood glucose between meals for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0This is more of a problem with lower grade food that uses high level of grains in their foods.\u00a0\u00a0Human diabetic patients need to limit carbohydrates to gain the best control of their disease.\u00a0\u00a0There are some grains that are much better and those include oatmeal, barley and rye.Good foods that use those better grains and at lower levels are wellness, go natural, and fromm.There are now grain free cat foods that are great.-wellness core, evo, acana, orijen, go natural (some versions), now, natural balance and fromm (some versions) and horizon legacy.I personally rotate my cats' food (one 19 year old and one 3 year old).\u00a0\u00a0Their main food is Go natural which I switch from their chicken formula and fresh trout formula.\u00a0\u00a0Then they have another \"treat food\" that I switch and give a small amount each morning.\u00a0\u00a0My younger cat also gets fromm surf and turf in his treat ball for some extra mental stimulation and activity level.\u00a0\u00a0Then they get 1/4 of a can of wet food each morning which I use 8 brands to rotate flavours (wellness, go natural, fromm, merrick, snappy tom, almo nature, holistic select and natural balance).",
