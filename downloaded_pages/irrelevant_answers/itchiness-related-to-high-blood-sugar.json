            "answer": "\"Is my itchiness related to my blood sugar?\"My answer is yes and no. Irregular blood glucose can cause itchiness. Liver damage can cause it too. I say this because of your Addiction Recovery profile, which I must congratulate you on for your road to recovery. When itchy does liquid [water or lotion] applied to the itchy area provide temporary relief? If yes, seek referral to a Gastroenterologist and get a either Contrasted CT Scan or a biopsy of the liver. [post back and I will xplain why] If no, concentrate on getting your blood glucose under control. The times to test are:1. Fasting: First thing in the morning b4 eating or drinking any colored liquids 8-10 hours prior. Normal levels are 70-99 mg/dl.2. B4 each meal to get a baseline measurement3. Two-three hours after each meal to see how the foods you ate affects your blood glucose. Normal levels are <180 mg/dl. Ask your Endo for he/she may want to see <140 mg/dl. [< means less than]Keep a written log of your test results and of the foods you ate. Stop eating foods that raise your glucose levels. Besides watching sugar in your diet-- you also need to watch carbohydrates (starches) carefully too. For example-- things like breads, potatoes, pasta, crackers, etc. can cause a drastic rise in your blood sugar if you aren't careful. (They are converted to sugar after you eat them.)Other foods/drinks need care too (example; milk, fruit, fruit juice) can also cause blood sugar to rise (so serving sizes and moderation are important). With fruit it\u2019s important to eat them with other foods to slow the absorption of fructose (fruit sugar). I'm NOT saying that these foods aren't allowed. What I AM saying is that you need to use care and follow the guidelines for diabetics.",

Carb sugars means just that but in lower quantities. Every 7 grams of carb sugars equals one heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar. Heed what I stated earlier.It's hard to say borderline diabetic unless your fasting numbers are between 100-125 mg/dl. When you constantly test in these ranges you are considered prediabetic and/or borderlinbe diabetic. Anything above 126 mg/dl is Type 2 Diabetes. Your doctor is correct, proper nutrition, weight control and physical exercise are the best in lowering and controlling blood glucose levels. It doesn't take much to go from prediabetes [borderline] to diabetes. Once you've entered into diabetes land there is no cure nor turning back. It's not nice being on this side of the fence.Don't ask for a physical but a \"health checkup\". A physical is a thump on your knees to test reflex, body weight and height measurement, a listen to your heart and lungs and they send you home. A health checkup includes the aforementioned items. A CBC [complete blood count/check] will be undertaken too. Depending on the results of the CBC you may or may not require further testing. As far as the liver goes, ask for the following tests; an ALT [Alanine Transaminase]. When the liver is injured it release this enzyme along with the AST [Aspartate Aminotransferase] enzyme in high amounts.",

            "answer": "\"I'm confused...my fasting numbers are in the 90's...my \"2 hours after meal\" numbers are a bit high (121-147)... \"I will try to clear the confusion. Fasting [prandial] and after meal [postprandial] levels are not the same and quite different. Please don't mix the two together. Here's why:* A fasting [prandial] test helps determine how well your body manages blood glucose without outside influences.* After meal [postprandial] identifies two things; 1) whether the types of food consumed are causing unnecessary/unexpected rises in your blood glucose levels above normal levels [see below]; 2) whether your body can shed the excess glucose caused by the foods/liquids consumed.Normal levels are:* Fasting [prandial]: 70-99 mg/dl* After meal 2-3 hrs [postprandial]: below 180 mg/dl although some doctors prefer to see below 140 mg/dl. You need to reference your lab copy of the test results for the ranges expected by your doctor. By law, lab copies must be furnished to the patient upon request.\"I go for another glucose tolerance test the end of this month\"Ask for an A1c test. The A1c provides a better insight of how well you have managed your blood glucose over a period of time.This diabetes web page is well laid out with easy to understand explanations on diabetes symptoms, causes, prevention, and treatment. http://diabetes.emedtv.com/",
