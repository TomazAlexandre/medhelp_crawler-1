I felt sick and woozy, just because of all the caffeine and sugar and not having it like that in months, but nothing like that stuff they give you. If I failed and had to do the three hour test then I would've had to drink the stuff you're all talking about having to take.",

With the first two I threw it up within ten minutes and felt sick for days afterwards. It was miserable. The third time my doctor told me to try zofran before drinking it. That's the only way I would have kept it down. Turns out I have gestational diabetes.",
