It doesn't take much for it to kick in.\u00a0\u00a0Most typically, the vision is pretty blurry, and the color is washed out.\u00a0\u00a0I also have extreme weakness in my arms and I will get a tremor when overheated.This must be extremely frustrating to figure out the mystery as to why this is happening to you.\u00a0\u00a0I would be . . .\u00a0\u00a0Are you experiencing any other symptoms?Have you had lots of blood work besides the test for diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0There's all sorts of autoimmune disorders, vitamin diffencies, hormonal issues (like thyroid disease), that mimic the symptoms of MS.\u00a0\u00a0I had about 15 vials of blood taken from me (no joke) to rule out other causes.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. The only blood tests I have had done are for kidney and diabetes. I dont get other symptoms, and you are right it is frustrating, like living with a sword hanging over your head, though I am sure you know what thats like. The only real medical problem I have is Arthritis in the neck though I have been told that couldnt be the cause of this, I am not so sure because I cant think of anything else.",

    "question": "I am a fifty one year old male, I exercise regularly and am fit. For the past seven to eight years I have had a problem during exercise and sometimes when not exercising of blurriness in patches around but not in my central vision. I have been tested by opthalmologists, cardiologists, had blood tests done for diabetes, echocardiogram of the heart and scans of the arteries in my neck all of which proved negative. I have been examined at the walton center for multiple sclerosis near Liverpool england, I had full scans which showed nothing, along with visual evoked potential scans which also showed nothing, I looked up the uthoffs on the internet and this seems to fit the bill, apart from the fact that it has happened when I have not been overheated, I would appreciate greatly anyones advice, as I no longer have anyone to which I can go having exhausted all the medical tests according to my Doctor.",
