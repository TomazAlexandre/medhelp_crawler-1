            "answer": "It would be most helpful if you could post actual thyroid test results for Free T3, Free T4 and TSH, along with the antibody results.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure to include reference ranges, since these vary lab to lab and must come from your own report.Has anyone checked your blood sugar levels?\u00a0\u00a0Done a Hemoglobin A1c?\u00a0\u00a0Unexplained weight loss and extreme thirst are classic symptoms of diabetes...\u00a0\u00a0That's one option..Has anyone done a thyroid ultra sound?\u00a0\u00a0Do you know if you have nodules on your thyroid?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, nodules can produce hormones, independently of the thyroid and there's no way to control that.......Acid reflux is a classic symptom of hypothyroidism and levels don't have to be out of range in order for you to have symptoms.Please post whatever lab results you have, so we can better assess your testing/treatment.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't have copies of your labs, you are entitled, by law, to get a copy, upon request.",

            "answer": "Have you been tested for TSI for Graves disease?Some people with Hashimoto's swing between Hyper to Hypo which sounds a lot like what you describe you are experiencing.\"Leaking\" nodules on a thyroid can also cause this as periodically the nodules will \"leak\" out or produce excess thyroid for a time and then nothing other times.As stated above please post the lab results and reference ranges.",

            "answer": "I have not even viewed a copy of my test results, as my mother insists on taking care of my medical documents, which she often throws away. I just sent a message to my doctor requesting them to by posted on my patient portal, so I will post them here soon.My pediatrician used to check my blood sugar levels regularly because she thought the same and it was always normal. At an urgent care visit in February I had my glucose and hemoglobin levels checked with a finger *****, and I remembered the numbers: Blood Sugar was 137 and hemoglobin was 13.7.It's also worth mentioning that I am relatively thin: 5'10 and 140 lbs.",

            "answer": "I don't know your age, but you might ask your mother to please be sure to keep the copies of your blood work.\u00a0\u00a0Often, by looking back, we can see a trend or something that might be helpful.Many of us who have known thyroid issues, keep copies of our blood work and note on each one, what symptoms we had, the medication we're on, etc.\u00a0\u00a0These, then become a running record of our issues and are permanent part of our medical records.If you know you\u00a0\u00a0have a goiter, which is simply a swollen/inflamed thyroid, there's a good chance that you have Hashimoto's and it simply hasn't progressed to the point of causing your levels to be out of range.\u00a0\u00a0The swelling/inflammation is often caused by the antibodies. A small percentage of people with Hashimoto's don't have antibodies; for other, they just don't show up on blood tests right away.I can't say much about the blood glucose in Feb - it would depend on how long it had been since you ate/drank anything other than water.\u00a0\u00a0If it was a fasting blood sugar, it was too high.\u00a0\u00a0Hemoglobin is not the same as a Hemoglobin A1c.\u00a0\u00a0An A1c is a very sensitive test that will tell what the average of your blood sugars have been over a 2-3 month period and is used to diagnose diabetes.5'10\" and 140 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0What's your age?\u00a0\u00a0Your profile says you are a male, but your reference to periods tells me otherwise. Both the thyroid and reproductive system are endocrine and the hormones must balance out in order for everything to work well.\u00a0\u00a0Have you had reproductive hormones tested?Your symptoms certainly could be thyroid related, but without seeing actual test results and ranges, there's not a lot we can suggest.",

    "question": "For the past 3 years, I have had very noticeable Thyroid symptoms, to the point where literally every time I go in to Urgent Care or my Primary, they insist on testing my levels.Rather rapid weight loss although I am eating two or three times the normal amount I consume. Nervousness, drinking over 2 gallons of water, complete loss of periods, unable to tolerate heat.And then other times I gain weight while only able to eat a maxiumum of 700 calories a day, fatigue, depression, hair loss, edema. Add in some delerium and paranoia on occassion, too. I also develop develop tics, aphasia, numbness, and extremely dry skin. My blood pressure is normally significantly low due to Orthostatic Hypotension, and in this last stage, the top number raised by over 40!!!I also have an a goiter, that is getting more pronounced. In fact, when I go to the doctors for like, my stomach reflux or something, most doctors (including my new gp) point it out immediately and begin to examine it and state that it is swollen and want to do tests. It has gotten to a point where my insurance company is questioning why I need to have these levels checked half a dozen times a year!!!T3, T4, TSH, Thyroid Peroxidase And Thyroglobulin Ab have been checked and all \"normal\".However, I went to Urgent Care this Feb with uncontrollable vomiting and stomach pain (the reflux) and the PA felt the need to test my thyroid, and I received a call back from her the next day stating that my TSH levels were high, but in the \"normal\" range, and came back for further testing of all of the other levels, and the TSH again, and they apparently showed nothing this time.This is confusing the absolute hell out of me and my new GP.Any ideas???",
