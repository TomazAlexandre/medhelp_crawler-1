    "question": "Just wondering of any ladies are out there with diabetes and are having a hard time controlling their numbers?\u00a0\u00a0My first son was born 13+ years ago and I went undiagnosed with gestational diabetes (he had a pretty traumatic birth and has cerebral palsy and learning disabilities ). I was diagnosed with type 2 a few years later and then in 2008 had a miscarriage at about 10 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I got pregnant and gave birth to a healthy baby boy in 2011, but not without having trouble controlling my sugar. I suffer from food addiction which is part of the trouble. Last October I had a miscarriage again at only 5 weeks. I am now 6week 1day and am terrified of a miscarriage.\u00a0\u00a0I just have such a difficult time controlling my food/Carb intake and therefore my sugars. Anyways I really am just curious as to others experience with pregnancy and diabetes and if anyone has some encouraging words.",
