            "answer": "Hey remember the growth scans etc are an estimate!\u00a0\u00a0They induced me with gestational diabetes and predicted my daughter would be big. She was only 6lb 6 and a half ounces. That is still on the small side of average so don't worry! I was 5lb 12 at birth and my brother was 5lb 3 and we were ALL healthy! My daughter is healthy, advanced and very clever. She had an infection when born but nothing to do with her size.. so even 6lb isn't considered underweight, plus the last few weeks they really pack the weight on, sounds like you have nothing to worry about so relax :)! x",

            "answer": "Honestly, your baby will be a healthy size, you don't have to worry about it.! :) I know how worrying it can be as I've had growth scans both pregnancies because of gestational diabetes, one minute too small, then too big, pregnancy is an anxious time, we just want our babies to be healthy. And don't worry. I am rubbish with pain. My mother even lovingly said \"Oh god how are you going to cope in labour.. you're really gonna have a rough time, you're rubbish with pain\" and then after I had my daughter she was amazed watching me go through it.. I coped up until 7cm without an epidural, and then didn't get it topped up so I could feel for pushing. The shock on her face was great haha. She said I coped really well that she ate her words. :) You'll be fine, honestly, your instincts take over and you just get on with it.",

I was terrified of giving birth again after the nightmare with my daughter (I felt EVERYTHING because hospital staff didnt listen when I said Id need a stronger dose than normal for the epidural - I have a fast acting liver, if ya dont get me hard the first time nothing works). But when I was laying in bed watching tv with my second my Dad was cringing watching the contractions go off the scale and he looked at me with wide eyes going \"Now thats some good pain killers!\" I was like \"What? What pain killers? They arent giving me anything til before breaking the water...\" He about fell out of his chair lol",
