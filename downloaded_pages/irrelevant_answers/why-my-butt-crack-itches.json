            "answer": "Hi,There could be several causes for the symptoms you are having. You should reconsult with your doctor to rule out the following possible causes -'Perfumes, chemicals, or dye on toilet paper can cause an allergic reaction.Moisture from sweat or diarrhea may cause itching. If the anal skin stays wet, the skin begins to break down.Some foods irritate the anus when they are expelled during a bowel movement. The most common culprits are caffeine, chocolate, beer, nuts, dairy products, and spicy food.Infections such as pinworms, yeast, and genital warts can cause itching.Hemorrhoids, which cause painful swelling of blood vessels in the anal area, can cause itching.Cancer, in rare instances, may be a cause.'There are certain factors which predispose to the risk of developing anal itching as a symptom.'Factors that put people most at risk for anal itching are as follows:DiabetesRecent antibiotic useChronic dry skin conditions such as psoriasis and seborrheaProfuse sweating.'You need to wash the areas several times with fresh water. Do not use any cosmetic products at the sites.Apply calamine lotion at the site of the lesions and see if it helps. You could take some oral antihistamine medications like cetrizine or loratadine. You need to maintain a good personal hygiene .Anti-itch drugs, often antihistamine, may reduce the itch during a flare up of eczema, and the reduced scratching in turn reduces damage and irritation to the skin.For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g. hydrocortisone or desonide), whilst more severe cases require a higher-potency steroid (e.g. clobetasol propionate, fluocinonide).Do discuss these with your doctor and exclude any possible causes in your case.Post us if you need any further information and let us know about how you are doing.Regards.",
