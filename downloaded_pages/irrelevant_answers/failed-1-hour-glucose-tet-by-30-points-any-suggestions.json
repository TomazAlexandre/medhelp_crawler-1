            "answer": "Thank you for the replies ladies. I feel so better reading them. All this while i kept wondering what did i do wrong. doubt if i would pass the 3 hrs test. But will accept whatever happens and do my best! Thats all i can control. :)@azndoraemon: i am not sure. But you could have a point. My husband's family does have a history of high blood sugar!! I will defintely ask my doc during the next visit if that could make a difference. Also i have heard from a doctor friend of mine that stress can produce hormones which increase the blood sugar level. I was indeed very very stressed the last 2 weeks(thanks to my MIL!!). So that could be the reason too. Ugghh!!",

The good thing is you will get a lot more special care/more ultrasounds if you do end up having GD, I just gave birth to my lo 2 weeks ago and she is perfect. I dont have diabetes in my family, however my husband does have it, not sure there is a connection? But anyway of only failing by 30 points I'm sure you will pass your next one. Did you eat before going in? Mine was fasting.",

            "answer": "The glucose test measures ur diabetes not the baby's.. therefore it's not based on the father's family history. It is ur diet. Or diet b4 ur pregnancy. There r many foods that some ppl think it's healthy (like some fruit) when it's very hight in sugar. N juice soda Aldo contribute. But in order to know we would have to examine what u eat on a regular bases for a while. N ur fat percentage n body type. If it's not that it's just pregnancy developed diabetes.. it might go away but it does mean that ur more likely to develop it later on in life. So definitely u have to look into what ur diet consist of if u want to avoid it later.",

Initially was a little upset since i was not expecting this result going by my family history and my food habbits. But now i feel its better that i will be closely monitored and get all the special care rather than doing something wrong and going undetected! Anything thats good for my baby, i wouldnt mind doing. :)Another positive outcome from my GD diagnosis is that i have completely started ignorning my MIL and her tantrums, have learnt to say a \"NO\" and set the limits without hesitating. All i really care is about my baby! Just want theae remaining 10 weeks to pass away soooon! :)",
