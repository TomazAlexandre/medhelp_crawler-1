            "answer": "Hi,I did answer you in the diabetes forum, but I will answer here too.1. Treatment for hypothyroid would normally improve blood sugar / insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Some people who are prediabetic may find their numbers improve once they start medication.2. Type 1, autoimmune type diabetes - used to be known as juvenile, can come on at any age.\u00a0\u00a0Ie. it is not limited to children. However in adults the onset may be rapid or it may be slower.3. the 208 was how long after eating?\u00a0\u00a0However, 208 is always too high.\u00a0\u00a0A normal fasting blood sugar should be in the low to mid- 80s (acceptable range 70 - 90).\u00a0\u00a0Although 108 fasting will only get you an official diagnosis of prediabetes, the 208 (I assume post eating), is way too high and will get you an official diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Normal non-diabetic post eating will be close to fasting levels (let say a range of 80 - 120), though the drs will use 140 as a cut off.The sudden thirst / urination makes me suspect a possibility of Adult onset type 1.\u00a0\u00a0It may not be, but should be ruled out.I would now recommend:-1. Continue testing y our fasting blood sugar and 1 1/2 - 2 hours after eating.\u00a0\u00a0Write it all down, including what you ate.2.Go see your dr complaining of thirst and frequent urination,\u00a0\u00a0and show him / her your recorded results.\u00a0\u00a0You dr should test Hba1c (average 3 month blood sugar, fasting blood sugar, and maybe order a glucose tolerance test).\u00a0\u00a0Urinalysis would be a good idea too.\u00a0\u00a0If you are positive for diabetes, I would suggest you ask for antibody testing to find out the type.\u00a0\u00a0If type 1 the appropriate treatment is insulin.\u00a0\u00a0If type 2, then oral medications work well for some (but if not, then again insulin is the medication of choice).If you are going to 200+ after eating you probably need medications.\u00a0\u00a0 You need to restrict your carbs significantly.\u00a0\u00a0If you have a blood sugar meter you caqn test 1.5 - 2 hours after eating and see how high you go.\u00a0\u00a0If you go high, then you need to try eating a similar meal with less carbs next time and see what happens / adjust further.Exercise will also help bring down blood sugars.Please come back and let us know how you go.For chelly, if you are fluctauting from 95 - 225 daily you are diabetic (people with diabetes can also have lows).\u00a0\u00a0 Low carb diet, exercise, weight manageme3nt if you are overweight, and medications if necessary.\u00a0\u00a0Treat this seriously and aggressively and you will live a long and healthy life.\u00a0\u00a0If your Dr doesn't take this seriously as well, then you probably need a new Dr.",

            "answer": "Hi,Hashimoto and RA are both autoimmune diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Autoimmune diseases often cluster.\u00a0\u00a0Having one or two autoimmune diseases makes it more likely than in person with no autoimmune conditions, to develop a third condition.Your lab results stating hyperglycemia and then having to wait is not really good... how high is high?Anyway, Low carb and exercise will help manage things.\u00a0\u00a0Can you get a blood sugar meter and test fasting and 1 1/2- 2 hours post eating to see what is happening.",

    "question": "0VLearning about Diabetes...confusedI am not diabetic but pre-diabetic. I have hashimotos and currently take levothyroxine 75 mg. I had been urinating every 5-10 for the last 36 hours. I had someone test my blood sugar late evening yesterday and it was 208 (I was scared to death) I fasted overnight and tested it this morning (108). There are claims that levo raises BS. I am also on a host of other supplements. What should I be doing or what questions should I be asking my doctor.",
