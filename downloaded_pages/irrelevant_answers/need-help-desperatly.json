            "answer": "HiAs I understand from your post heart pathology is ruled out. Other causes for these symptoms could be thyroid problems, diabetes, endocarditis (if not ruled out already), certain cancers, HIV/AIDS infection, complicated hiatal hernia etc. I do not think the symptoms are allergic in nature because of your pets.However it is difficult to diagnose without examining. You will need to undergo a few tests to rule out the above causes. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted.",
