            "answer": "They only did the Echo. The cardiologist said for reasons he refusd to do the stress wich originaly was scheduled then canceled , were :the test was done 6 mos ago and there could be NO changes within my heart that would cause me to code within six months.The test could cause cancer due to the medication injected .And he didnt think my insurance would cover it.He acted like it was my fault i insisted on this test, when in fact the surgeon told me : No Echo No surgery. And must get the drainage tube removed here. So will need surgery to do this.I cannot get to a cardiologist here without referral. I will ask the surgeon for a diff referral when i can reach him if hes not satisfied with just this echo.",

            "answer": "I'd try very hard for a second opinion.\u00a0\u00a0Most insurance companies have procedures to deal with second opinions, and I'd definitely contact the insurance patient advocate to establish that protocol.I've had at least eight stress tests, and cancer from the dye has never been mentioned as a worry.\u00a0\u00a0It can be a problem if you have an allergy to it.Keep us informed.",

    "question": "Recently was in surgery to have a kidney stone removed, when my heart stopped beating, and my surgeon told me he had to resuscitate me to save my life. The removal of the stone was not finished, due to this. He requested tests from my cardiiologist who did not co operate with provideing him what he asked for until it was pushed. He then did a Echo. And compared my tests from six months prior along with it, showing nothing was wrong. He cleared me for surgery. So , if my heart is in perfect condition, why did it stop beating in the surgery? I am 57, and have all the flags for CHF . I have shortness of breath upon rest, 120 resting pulse, high blood pressure, diabetes. My question is how can my heart be so perfect and yet i coded in surgery. My surgeon\u00a0\u00a0also told me that he did not feel my heart could withstand another rescusitation. Yet the cardiologsit said my heart was perfect, minus a sinus tachycardia.From birth i have a heart murmur that required surgery at age 13, but was not done.",
