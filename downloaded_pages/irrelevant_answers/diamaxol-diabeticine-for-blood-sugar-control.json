            "answer": "Hi, I'm not a medical professional, I'm just a parent of a child with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The <a href=\"http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/cyber/2005/CL178e.pdf\" target=_blank>FDA says</a> that there is no evidence that the ads for Diabeticine violate the law because they are not correct.\u00a0\u00a0For example, it states that Diabeticine is 64% effective for reversing type 1.\u00a0\u00a0That in itself is a ludicrous claim.\u00a0\u00a0If it were valid, there would be a couple million families buying as much of this as they can.It is also claimed that Diabeticine increased the number of islet cells.\u00a0\u00a0This claim is absolutely bogus.\u00a0\u00a0There is no known way to count the number of islet cells in a living person.\u00a0\u00a0It's simply not possible with today's technology.In my opinion, the only reason that the company is able to still market this stuff is because they are claiming it as a \"health supplement\", which is not subject to stringent FDA regulations.\u00a0\u00a0There is no known research of anything which reverses the cause of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing.\u00a0\u00a0This is a bogus product, and I wouldn't spend a penny on it.",

            "answer": "I am a type 1 diabetic who has been using Diamaxol (Diabeticine) for a little over a year.\u00a0\u00a0I can understand why people would think the claims for this product are rediculous, but I decided since the medical community wasn't curing me, I would give it a shot.\u00a0\u00a0My insulin needs have in fact been reduced.\u00a0\u00a0I am certainly still not cured, but N dosage has gone from 6 units in the am to 1 unit, and evening N dosage from 12 units to 9.\u00a0\u00a0Based on early am blood sugar levels, this looks like it will be going to 8 units soon.\u00a0\u00a0If insulin needs keep dropping, I will probably continue to take it.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetics are often deficient in certain vitamins and minerals which are found in this product.\u00a0\u00a0Also, herbs such as banaba and bitter melon (also fenugreek) contain polypeptide-p (plant insulin) which helps to manage blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0The cinnamon can help with insulin resistance and gymnema sylvestre can reduce sugar cravings.\u00a0\u00a0There are other \"diabetic multivitamins\" that may be effective, though I am not familiar with them personally.\u00a0\u00a0I suspect any of them would be more effective for a type 2 than a type 1.\u00a0\u00a0Also, Techmedica recommends at least 15 minutes of daily exercise along with Diamaxol use.\u00a0\u00a0I am quite active and at one point, my daily N was only 1 unit/day; however, due to a knee/hip injury that activity level dropped and insulin needs increased again.The per bottle price decreases the more you order (buy 2 bottles, get 1 free; buy 3 bottles, get 2 free, etc) and they send a bottle of digestive enzymes with every order, though I personally feel the Now Foods brand pancreatin is just as good and much more reasonably priced.",
