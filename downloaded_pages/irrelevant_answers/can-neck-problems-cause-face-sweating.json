            "answer": "Wow, I had to check this twice to make sure I hadn't posted it myself and forgotten!I have identical symptoms and I can see how the neck and falling-asleep-everywhere thing might be connected - I fall asleep as soon as I sit down ANYWHERE and my head lolls forward and it causes pressure on my cervical discs.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot drive either for the same reason.I am awaiting a neurological examination because as well as disc degeneration (cervical spondylitis) I also have a painful shoulder and numbness in my hand and last two fingers.I cannot sleep at night for the constant sweating and by day I have to change my clothes, have several showers etc.I can't imagine that all three symptoms are related but certainly, sweating (especially of the face and head) and drowsiness are two key symptoms of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have already had that checked and I was borderline - I would advise you to do so too. I shall read your replies with interest!",
