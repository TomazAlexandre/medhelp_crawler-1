            "answer": "Hi,I am not sure if your symptoms are from an Endocrine disorder, but there a few things that should be checked.In regard to the chem panel, as long as you fasted for atleast 8 hours, it should not really make a difference what you ate in terms of catching a low level. Sugars in the 80's are not likely the cause of your symptoms, unless you dropped from a much higher number(like 180) and you feel badly because of the drop.A few endocrine causes should be checked out if they have not already: thyroid disease(hyper and hypo) as well as adrenal insufficiency and testosterone levels. It is rare, but you should also be checked for a pheochromocytoma, esp if you have high blood pressure. Talk to your doctor about those. If they are all okay, and you also have an oral glucose tolerance test that is completely normal, then it is less likely to be an endocrine problem. But this is a good start.Take care.",

    "question": "I hope you can help me anyway even though I don't have diabetes. I know you're an endocrinologist and I'm not sure what specialty my problem falls under since I don't know my diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I am in my mid 30's, male, happily married...with a 15 year total pack a day smoking habit (on and off).\u00a0\u00a0I am about 35 lbs overweight.\u00a0\u00a0So that is my history.I started having a real bad headache and intense 'brain fog' that won't go away (still won't) 2.5 years ago. Was told after alot of testing it was consitent with \"benign new daily persistant headache\".\u00a0\u00a0Survived for 2 more years uncomfotable but living. Headache remains unchanged...is it related to my new symptoms or coincidental?\u00a0\u00a0 Who knows, right? I've been searching for diagnoises for so long.So, a few months ago I had a heart flutter and pre syncope, nobody knows why, I wore a montior for 30 days and couldnt catch one. So then I started feeling very sick on and off through the day, weak, nauseated, \"air hunger\" at times,\"floating energy on and off in abdomen that causes heart to race with any provocation such as anger, excitement, arousal, anything that makes adreneline surge)\",when I go tachycardic my upper chest pulsates and hurts, I feel lightheaded and and predisposed to near syncope when I tach.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise I have bizarre symptoms that come and go and are often relieved by eating a BIG meal..first I thought i was hypoglycemic but symptomatic sugar has measured high 80's.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible I have \"fooled the chemistry panels\" by eating big meals before setting off to the doctor?My echocardiogram was normal, and I dont know what specialist I should see.Yes I know my symptoms are bizarre, but what can you tell me?",
