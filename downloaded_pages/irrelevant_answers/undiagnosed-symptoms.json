            "answer": "Your symptoms including tireless, thirst, sensitivity to light, tingling etc indicate that more is going on that you merely being, in your words \"massively unfit\". Of course Iosing weight can only make things better.I agree that your first port of call should be an endocrinologist. Such a physician will run many tests. And a good one can interpret these properly. A GP can't do so.What you need to do before just attending an endocrinologist is make sure you're seeing an excellent one. Most are kind of ordinary. Most are not familiar with symptoms out of left field. They make mare their $ treating conditions they know eg diabetes.If I were you I would look for an endocrinologist aged say 60+ who is affiliated with a teaching hospital. He may work both in private practice and for the hospital but he will almost always have his office at or very near the hospital. May I ask, where are you?",

            "answer": "Hey,Thanks a lot for the advice. I'm in the UK so I'm at the mercy of the NHS depending which endocrinologist I see. I could pay to go private but that's kinda a last resort as it'll be pretty expensive.I'v decided to start taking Olive Leaf Extract as I'v heard it's pretty good for fatigue and stuff, kinda guessing that it can't do me any harm even if it doesn't help.I guess there's not much else I can do whilst I wait 10 weeks for this Endocrinologist appointment other than to try to look after myself and do a little exercise when I feel capable.",

            "answer": "Hey I was just reading your post and would recommend you getting checked for a condition that I have called May-Thurner Syndrome or Iliac Vein Compression. It causes all of the problems you are having and almost no doctors know anything about this condition. Your increase in weight gain most likely caused further compression of this vein and this is why you're experiencing all the other problems now. It also causes extreme fatigue after exercising. I can tell you from personal experience that you're wasting your time with endocrinologists. Get an ultrasound specifically looking for this condition or doctors will miss it everytime even though it's practically staring right at them. An Interventional Radiologist is who you need to see to perform a venogram and place a stent if necessary. I had one placed at this site recently and all my problems (brain fog, anxiety, depression, dizziness and balance problems, leg heaviness/ pain standing for short periods of time, aches all over body, and many more) immediately disappeared. Hope this helps. Feel free to private message me with any questions.",

            "answer": "Thanks a lot for the advice guys.I'v heard a search for a private Endoncrinologist in my area and the only one within 30 miles appears to be this one:http://*****.***He doesn't look mega experienced, but it's probably better than the NHS one that I'v got to wait an eternity to see.I had never heard of that condition that you have Johnny, I guess it is a possibility. I do have fairly bad varacous veins which could suggest there's a problem in that area. I'll do some research and mention it to my GP if the condition does appear to match what I'm going through.",

            "answer": "I just saw you listed vericose veins as a problem as well.\u00a0\u00a0The vein conditions I mentioned May-Thurner and Nutcracker Syndrome are definite causes of vericose veins as well as vericocele veins in men. Unfortunately doctors are not very informed about these vein compression conditions and often miss them. Please press them on these as they are most likely causing all you're problems. Good luck to you!",

    "question": "Hi guys,Not really sure where to start or indeed where to post this, so if it's in the wrong forum please direct me to the correct place.I'v been experiencing quite a wide range of symptoms over the last 9 months, which are as follows:- Hypoglaecemic symptoms. Urgent need to eat, body trembling etc. Usually solved by eating and sitting down for a while.- Fatigue. Being on my feet for any period can often make me incredibly tired. For example I was on my feet at work the other day for 30 minutes. It left me so tired that I had to sit down. I'v felt exhausted since (almost 3 days ago now) and am unable to function as normal. I don't even have the energy to sit in my chair at work, so I'm pretty much confined to bed / sofa.- Muscle twitches / spasms. Mainly in arms and legs, though does occur all over the body.- A feeling that my entire body is tingling, and a hot/burning sensation that tends to move around my body. Often it feels like my blood is stinging me from the inside? :s- Mild chest pain / heart palpatations- Oversensitivity to light - often just going outside into daylight can make my eyes hurt- Excessive thirst- Pretty much constant headaches, mild disorientationI think that pretty much sums up the symptoms I'v been experiencing. I have had multiple blood tests (nothing found), heart rhythm recording, ecg, heart scan (nothing found). The Consultant Neurologist fobbed me off, but has arranged an MRI on my brain just to be safe.My GP has now referred me to Endocrinology, but is currently of the belief that the symptoms may be functional e.g. with no medical reason for them, and as such has referred me to counselling (there's a 3 month waiting list for each, and my symptoms are getting no better).To give some background to my situation:- I have been receiving counselling for alcoholism and depression since a month or so before the symptoms started. I'll be the first to admit that I have been extremely unhappy and stressed over the last year, however my alcohol consumption has been hugely reduced in the last four months (maximum drinking one day per week, not heavily). My mood and general outlook are now much much better than I was at my worst (and when the symptoms started). I feel like I'v pretty much conquered the alcohol and the depression and am ready to move on with my life, however these physical symptoms are preventing me from doing so.- I'm a 29 year old male. I am not the most physically active however I used to be pretty physically active. I am pretty overweight and during the last couple of years my diet was pretty bad (fixed now!) and my alcohol consumption way too high (fixed now!)- I did have Glandular fever around 8 years ago, and I'v heard that it can linger in your body for many years afterwards. I am a bit concerned about the link between GF and Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, especially considering my brother had both... however I am hopeful that there are other reasons for my symptoms.So.... does anybody have any idea what on earth could be wrong with me?Is it possible for stress to cause all of these?Is it just a case of me being massively unfit and needing to fight my way through it and do a lot more exercise? (I am trying to go to the gym once a week which leaves me absolutely exhausted.)",
