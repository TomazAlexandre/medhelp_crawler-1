            "answer": "I'm with you! I have normal diabetes that flared up really bad when I got pregnant, I started taking insulin right away. My baby is considered big. In fact at our 29 week scan he was an estimated 2kg! but I am constantly reassured by my doctors and midwives that a natural birth is still possible as long as we continue to keep an eye on the diabetes. You just need to do the best you can with what you have. Everything will work out perfect in the end. The power of positive thinking! :)",

            "answer": "I have GD to. I am 35+6. Had an ultrasound today and baby is measuring at around 39weeks. My Dr has said he will induce me at around 38 weeks because of bubs size. I expected it as my family have a strong diabetes history as well as large babies too... All good I get to meet my bug earlier than expected. :)I have kept my sugars in perfect range too, don't stress. You just do what you have to and look forward to the finish line, no matter how you cross it.",
