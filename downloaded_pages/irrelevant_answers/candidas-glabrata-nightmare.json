            "answer": "hopefuly u figured it out by now the negative swab seems strange although specific serious candidas can only be tested for in 2 labs in usa......stop with the presacriptions and use the good ol fashioned over the counter 7 day treatment but buy 2-3 boxes just incase if u don't notice immediate relief from over the counter stuff I am confused but u have to use it every day for 7-14 days most likely u will need 2 boxes if u had it that long but I do know ppl with regular yeast infections that did not go away w fluconazole or ne scripts infact theyd make them worse and those ppl would only see relief from over the counter topical insertion brands.",

    "question": "I have had \"Candidas Glabrata\" for almost 6 months now. Non-stop discharge, red achy vagina etc...I was only diagnosed by one doctor who looked under the microscope. The other doctor send a swab to the lab which came back negative for candidas. I don't know what to think or why my vagina has not healed or why I even have candidas.I tested for hiv 2 months after my last partner and it was negative. The other tests were negative as well. I don't have diabetes\u00a0\u00a0(got tested for that). And I don't have a bacterial infection.I just want this to go away. Do any of you have advice?I've tried terconazole, flucanazole, probiotics, tampons dipped in apple cider vinegar etc....",
