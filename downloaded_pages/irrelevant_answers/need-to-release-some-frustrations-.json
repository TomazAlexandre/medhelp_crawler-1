    "question": "So I am 34 weeks pregnant with my second child. Our little girl has put me through a whirlwind. I am getting so tired of being pregnant. I found out at 27 weeks that I had gestational diabetes. I have been able to keep my numbers low most of the time with the help of my medication. But I am ready to be able to eat my cereal or a cheese burger without knowing I will feel horrible afterwards. I also am more than ready to be able to have sex with my husband and enjoy it again. We still have sex but it is not enjoyable for me or him. Its more just to get the job done for him. I try so hard to enjoy it but NOTHING!!! My husband and I never had a problem with sex before this pregnancy. Now its all screwed up. I dream about having sex like we use to and that only makes it worse. I am so excited and scared to be having a daughter. I have a 4 year old son now and I am hoping I can be a good mother to my daughter and son both. Sorry. This is probably a silly vent",
