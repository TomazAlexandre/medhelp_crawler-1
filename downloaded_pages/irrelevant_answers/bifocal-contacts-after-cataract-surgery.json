    "question": "I've never worn contact lenses before.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, I hardly had to wear glasses until about a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0Now I have to have cataract surgery b/c undiagnosed diabetes had its wrath with me.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I've decided that monofocal lenses are the safest and best lens implant choice.\u00a0\u00a0My question is: can I wear bifocal contact lenses after I get monofocal cataract surgery and if so, what should I expect?Thanks!!",
