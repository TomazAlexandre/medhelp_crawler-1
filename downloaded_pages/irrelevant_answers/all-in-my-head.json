            "answer": "Thanks for your response. The doctor ran tests last Friday and will be able to tell me whats up today. As I made mention I do know that there is something going on with the chemicals that regulate mood/emotions/and thinking because I worry when I simply think or attempt to reason and an uncomfortable feeling follows the thought even if it is a good thought. Sounds crazy right!! So I am assuming that there is a mixup ahppening in the realm of my reasoning which is triggering emotions that are not associated with the thought. I believe the fatigue and constipation etc. are results of the stress that is following all the \"weight\" of the confusion. Seems more SPIRITUAL/MENTAL than physical but the symptoms are manifesting physically and I know that healing will occur, just need to find the DOORWAY to freedom!!",

            "answer": "Sounds like despite the anxiety and worry, you are still clearly able to think about all of this reasonably.\u00a0\u00a0No matter what the possible cause behind our mental states and physical health, while the docs (hopefully!) figure out what's going on, we all have to live with whatever is going on in the moment, and doing whatever we can to remain hopeful and optimistic is key.\u00a0\u00a0I commend you for staying as upbeat as possible.\u00a0\u00a0Hope your doc had good and helpful info for you.",

    "question": "Ive been diagnosed with diabetes for 8 years now and I have began to experience some problems with what feels like stuff \"moving\" in the top of my head. Ive also began to experience some problems with fatigue, weight loss constipation and particularily confusion which I know has to do with brain and possibly stomach chemicals like seritonin and adrenalin that are out of wack. A doctor said that there might be some issues going on with my thyroid gland also. HELP!!",
