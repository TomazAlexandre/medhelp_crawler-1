            "answer": "had surgery, labs, cat scans of chest and abdomen repeatedly, MRI of brain, recent allergy and asthma evokation testing and have another echocardiogram friday. previous ABGs show hypoxia on room air so am on bipap and not cpap. three sleep studies a year ago and they still could not figure out on the titration test an adequate setting for my pressures. have had lung function and VQ scan in past so they could repeat them and look for changes, but doctor has not ordered this. everything done in a major university teaching hospital with computer charting, that now has decided I am too pushy about aggrressive care like IV antibiotics when I present as a diabetic with MRSA and cellulitis! I thought I was being pro-active. Once the WBC and d dimer came back, they drew blood cultures and started vancomycin, but it took 5 hours of hasseling me first.",

            "answer": "the echocardiogram shows moderate pulmonary hypertension and my blood has high uric acid to go weith the painful jionts. So presumptive gout. can't take steriods and gain more wight, and have abdominal pain issues already so NSAIDS are a problem. Going to a rheumatoligist but likely will just be stuck on pain meds. The blood sugar control gets better on the diet peole with gout should avoid! Sometimes life sucks. So much pain today can't even sit for an hour-have to lay down with pain meds for back pain. left thumb is in play today also. neither the naproxen or\u00a0\u00a0the vicodan get rid of the pain. Getting real tired of all these problemns, so hoepfully I can find a nutritional plan that ereally helps my blood sugar and maybe pain.",

    "question": "Had psuedomyexoma peritonei of 80# that eroded hole in diaphragm. Repaired. Had collapsed left lung. Fixed. Got MRSA. Diabetes. Now shortness of breath worsening over 5-6 months like when 80# tumor yet pulse ox is ok. (was ok with collapsed lung too). easy wheezing. evoked asthma. have to work to breath most of the time. on bipap for sleep apnea. profound fatigue. (rash-suspected vasculitis) Positive d dimer, c reactive protein and elevated ESR. Low albumin. Possible pulmonary hypertension versus sarcoidosis versus constant panic attacks versus asthma different from evoked response of wheeze, cough, chest tightness? Feel like oxygen is not getting into blood no matter how deep I breathe. Taking a sit down shower leaves me out of breathe from excertion.",
