    "question": "Is there any places in Atlanta, Georgia that i can go to, and be tested to see if i have Diabetes? I realy need to know, because i realy don't know whats wrong with my legs, they hurt off and on, sometimes a burning pain, sometimes a stabing pain. But the pain stops if i squeeze my leg a little and push down, that gets the blood flowing. But it didn't start until I was pregnant. Please help! :-(",
