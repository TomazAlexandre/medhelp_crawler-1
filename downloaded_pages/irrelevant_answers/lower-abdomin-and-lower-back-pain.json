            "answer": "Get your adrenal glands checked.\u00a0\u00a0They are on top of your kidneys and make the hormones that control response to stress, that regulate electrolyte balance, and that are the precursors to sex hormones.Your gyn may be able to order some basic labs or can refer you to an endocrinologist.Adrenal problems cause almost all of the same symptoms as polycystic ovaries, but usually they are a little more extreme.\u00a0\u00a0Actually, recent research is beginning to indicated that PCOS is often CAUSED by adrenal dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0They are linked by means of insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0This seems to fit a few of your symptoms.Good luck.",

    "question": "I have no idea the cause, so I will throw a few things out there that have been going on and I am unsure if they are related.\u00a0\u00a0Not sure which of my dr's to see for it either without looking dumb or being misdiagnosed.I have mild endometriosis and I often have cysts and when not on birth control to control these things, I also have severe pain at the time of ovulation.Recently (a month ago) I was diagnosed with type 2 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I knew I hadn't been feeling well and having loose stools accompanied with stomach cramps 3-4 times a day but gaining weight rapidly which is what urged me to go to the dr. for testing.\u00a0\u00a0I am 29 years old,\u00a0\u00a05'1\" and 145 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0My typically weight is no more than 110... so this jump in weight is a HUGE deal!Anyhow... the last few weeks when something causes sudden stress... maybe an arguement or for instance yesterday I was working with police detectives on a sting to find a person who broke into my car and stole a lot of things... Normally when I have something that causes very sudden stress, I can feel my face and ears redden, heart rate increase, senses heightened and a bit jittery.\u00a0\u00a0Normal, I'd pressume.\u00a0\u00a0The last 2 instances of sudden stress after all those initial things happen... I have been getting a horrible aching, stabbing pain in the area of my kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0Both.\u00a0\u00a0This seems odd to me.Today, I am still feeling aches in my kidney's but also in the area that my right overy would be located.\u00a0\u00a0The frontal pain was bad enough to fully wake me when I tried to sit up a tad to see over my husband this morning to look at the clock.Any ideas??????\u00a0\u00a0(PS. I also posted this question in the diabetes forum)",
