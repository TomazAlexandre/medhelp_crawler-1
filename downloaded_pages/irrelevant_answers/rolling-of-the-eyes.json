            "answer": "Sounds like he had a seizure. I'v never heard of this kind of reaction with an asthma attack, maybe someone else on the forum has experience with that. If his colour was good, then his attack probably wasn't severe. I think you're correct in that this is more likely a cardiovascular issue. I have a cousin who used to get seizures when she had extremely low blood sugar levels with her diabetes, so there are many causes for such a reaction. You probably should check it out with his doctor just to be safe.",
