            "answer": "Since a physical problem seems to have been ruled out, then you have to consider a mental/ behavioral issue.\u00a0\u00a0Trembling that is unrelated to room temperature or fever is most likely from anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0It's a normal response for dogs who need to release tension and have no other way of doing it.One thing in particular to be aware of is to not give him affection when he has these spells.\u00a0\u00a0I know, I know - it's so hard not to do that because it's what we humans expect if we're upset.\u00a0\u00a0Dogs, however, only have the idea reinforced that there really IS something to be worried about when we give them affection at the wrong time.\u00a0\u00a0If you treat him as you would a human child, he will continue with the behavior.Since the symptoms happen at night, try giving him more structured exercise during the day.\u00a0\u00a0Go on two walks a day - increase the time slowly if he's not used to regular exercise.\u00a0\u00a0If the walk is all about your dog leading you and doing whatever he wants to do, that needs to change.\u00a0\u00a0If your dog currently thinks he's the pack leader, he's going to be under a whole lot of stress thinking he has to maintain that position.\u00a0\u00a0Never forget the old maxim: a tired dog is a good dog.\u00a0\u00a0And a tired dog is also a happy dog.Aside from physical exercise, dogs need mental exercise.\u00a0\u00a0You could start by hiding high-value treats in your home or yard and make a game out of having him find them.\u00a0\u00a0Although he's a small dog, having a \"job\" on the walk is also a form of mental exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Once he's in good physical shape you can add a coat with pockets for more weight like books or anything else that adds weight and bulk.\u00a0\u00a0Even a pulling a tiny cart will give him a job and tire him out.It's really pretty simple.\u00a0\u00a0Reward the behavior you want with praise and affection, and withhold affection from behavior you don't want.\u00a0\u00a0Affection given at the wrong time only makes things worse.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me, I know how difficult it can be.\u00a0\u00a0One of my dogs was been terrified of thunderstorms.\u00a0\u00a0The more I tried to comfort as I would a human child,\u00a0\u00a0the worse she got.\u00a0\u00a0Once I stopped giving her cuddles and affection and allowed her the time to deal with her fears on her own, she got over it - and pretty quickly.If none of these techniques help, then I strongly advise that you hire a veterinary behaviorist to evaluate both his behavior and your reaction to it.\u00a0\u00a0Anything you learn in that process can be applied to all dogs in your life, and also make your relationship with your dog so much more rewarding.\u00a0\u00a0It's all about learning to communicate and understand your dog's body language and basic mental and physical needs.\u00a0\u00a0Go for it!\u00a0\u00a0:-)",

            "answer": "thanks for posting the reply to LMC1 back in 2010. We are having the exact same problem with our Maltese / Jack Russel mix. I have been trying to comfort him when he gets this way (always at night and into the early morning), but will stop doing this. Do you suggest we put him in his crate and close it? we still have it but have not used it since he was a puppy (he's now almost 3).Thanks !",

    "question": "New symtptoms:\u00a0\u00a0(See recent relevant medical history below) In early Dec. 2010, my 10 year old Maltese male began scratching at the bed in the middle of the night. He usually sleeps and prefers to be in his own bed, in the bedroom.\u00a0\u00a0He was shivering severely and his body was very cold, including paw pads.\u00a0\u00a0It was Not cold in the house.\u00a0\u00a0Picked him up and warmed him up and after a fairly short amount of time he was then panting.\u00a0\u00a0After this, the entire next day he followed me Everywhere, tail drooping, hanging down.\u00a0\u00a0Very unusual for this Maltese as he is usually a Very Happy dog.\u00a0\u00a0He was extremely needy and wanted to be held and stroked constantly.\u00a0\u00a0After approx. 24 hours his behavior seemed to change back to normal, and I thought it had passed.\u00a0\u00a0I called his vet who is treating him for the diabetes, explained his symptoms and the vet offered no diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0His symptoms occurred again after several days, but without the trembling and cold body.\u00a0\u00a0 I took his temperature; it was between 100 and 101, so basically normal.\u00a0\u00a0I took him to another vet hoping for a diagnosis, but again no diagnosis offered.\u00a0\u00a0These symptoms have now occurred again on Dec. 17 - Dec. 18.\u00a0\u00a0PLEASE HELP.\u00a0\u00a0We are exhausted and don't know what to do.\u00a0\u00a0He doesn't wimper and although it would seem by his behavior that he is in pain he doesn not groan or cry out.\u00a0\u00a0He has to be coaxed to eat when he has these symptoms but he usually will east something - bits of chicken breast, or hypoallergenic biscuits.\u00a0\u00a0His symptoms seem to begin and get worse from approx. 12 Midnight to 9AM the next morning.Recent Medical History: My 10 year old male Maltese was diagnosed with diabetes in the Summer 2010.\u00a0\u00a0He's now fairly regulated and is on 11 units of Humulin injections 2X a day.\u00a0\u00a0In Nov. 2010 he had a tumor removed from his belly that came back from the pathologit diagnosed as a Grade 2, mast cell tumor.\u00a0\u00a0The good news, there was no metastasis anywhere else in his body, from tests for bone marrow, lungs, urine, etc.You help would be appreciated.",
