            "answer": "This sounds rather similar to a problem my daughter had from ages eight to 12. I took her to all sorts of pediatric specialists and no one could find anything wrong. They were looking for infections, whereas I felt it was due to an injury. I finally got someone to take me seriously. It was and injury, probably a whiplash which threw her spine out-of-whack, but too mildly to be grossly obvious. Her symptoms were mainly neurological and started with a headache, but would cause muscular problems as well.",

    "question": "My daughter is 27 years old.Two years ago she moved back to Canada from Australia, where she had been for 6 years, studying.While in Australia , she had a few episodes , of I guess passing out? I am not sure? What she told me was, she had been sitting down talking on the phone and got up, and the next thing she knew she was waking up on impact. she had fallen across the room into a book shelf , which had a heavy wicker basket on it,. A lg piece was lodged between her eyes on her face. She went to hospital and they were only concerned about the object, and not the reason why this happened in the first place.This was not the first time this has happened. Prior to going to Australia , the same kind of thing happened a few times, however she didn't pass out.I have no idea if these episodes are related or not, but I thought it was worth mentioning.Since being home, I have noticed some things going on. she has head aches a lot, and general aches and pains throughout her body. She has never been one to complain, however it is starting to affect her life. She is tired all the time, her legs ache . and most recent, she came home early from work as she has severe pain in her head and neck, she could barely move her neck, it hurt to lower it to look at the computer. she lay on the couch that night moaning, which is totally out of character for her. So I called the health nurse, they talked with her and suggested that she get looked at by a doctor within an hour.I took her to the hospital , the doctor looked at her neck and said it was muscular and gave her t3's and anti-inflammatories, the nurse took her blood pressure which was 140 over 88, she was then sent home.She has not been well since, she finds it difficult to stand for any length of time, she gets dizzy and is still in pain. She cannot take the t3's when she goes to work as they zone her out. I guess my question would be, what could be wrong with her??I have had\u00a0\u00a0fibromyalgia for many years\u00a0\u00a0now, brought on by an injury on the job.this also runs in our family, both sides, as well as many other things.fathers side....grandmother--lupus, FMgrangfather -died heart attackfather- heart attack, high cholesterolmother- fibromyalgia,tendonitis,\u00a0\u00a0arthritis, IBS, TMJ, IC,MIGRAINESmothers side......grandmother- had polio in the 40's, siezures-diabetes, high bp, supra nuclear palsygrandfather-high bp, brain aneurysm ...past away age 40brother-high bpmothers siblings..diabetes 6 out of 10 kidshigh bp, high cholesterol, heart disease, diabetes,blood disorders, arthritis, poly myalgia, strokes,heart attacks at age 38, with triple bypass.any ideas????",
