            "answer": "While many young people with Type 1 diabetes do go through rough transitions in their teen years, your son's behavior sounds like it is beyond that. Were the counselors he was seen by licensed mental health professionals? If so, I'm surprised that they didn't diagnose him with something else going on psychologically, which is what my gut is telling me.As a Type 1 diabetic (much older) I feel for your son and cannot even imagine how you must worry about him. On the other hand his behavior is unacceptable with or without diabetes and he is holding you emotionally hostage. That is no way to live. I will admit I am not a parent, so take my opinion for what it's worth. But you are not helping him and he is an adult who will not get help until he wants to. But that doesn't mean you have to put up with and finance it both with money and the extreme disruption to your peace of mind. I would tell him he either needs to get help or live on his own. But if you say that you need to mean it.",
