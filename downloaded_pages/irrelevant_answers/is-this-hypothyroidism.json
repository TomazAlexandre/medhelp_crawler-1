            "answer": "My numbers for TSH, T3, T4, etc. are fairly in line with yours. And I feel fine. Now I do that is. I also had similar symptoms you report after being treated for thyroid for a few years. Finally found out I was diabetic. After being treated for that the majority of those symptoms have disappeared.You don't mention getting your blood glucose readings and sugar levels tested A1c. These could have a lot to do with it too.Both issues have very high symptoms for flaky skin, hair loss, and fatigue. You also might want to check to see how your sleep habits are. Sleep Apnea is a very dangerous issue if unchecked. It also can produce skin issues, fatigue, the burning eyes, stomach issues, shortness of breath. In my opinion, Diabetes, Thyroid issues, and sleep disorders can all three mask the other for symptoms together. I would get all three of these areas well checked. Just to rule out any of this.",

            "answer": "I guess I have alot of questions to ask here.What other meds are you on?Have you reached post menopausal levels?What supplements do you take?Any surgeries?Taking a stab at looking at your labs since no references are given above. The free labs do seem off within the norm of levels.Your TSH slightly indicates a higher value based off the AACE recommendation of .3-3.0 reference range. Most true hypos after finding a sweet spot with meds and labs find the TSH value is lower - around 1.0 when they feel good.Also there is no indication or labs that could suggest you are autoimmune Hashi's which could be this issue for you too.",
