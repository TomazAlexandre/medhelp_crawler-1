A friend of mine had it with both of hers though and was treated by diet - she just had to be careful about following a diabetic friendly diet, which wasn't that much different than her usual diet. I have heard it can b worse, but they also have you go in for a 3 hour test if you have sugar levels that are too high after your first, 1 hour test.",
