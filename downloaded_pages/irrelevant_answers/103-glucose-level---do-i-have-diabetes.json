            "answer": "I'm assuming that 103 is a fasting blood sugar and if so it is considered pre-diabetes. It might help to have your doctor do an A1C which is an average of blood sugars for a couple months to correctly diagnose you. Unless you are spiking high after your meals, that 103 probably wouldn't account for the fatigue.",

            "answer": "A fasting level of 100 to 125 is considered prediabetes. Over 126 is diabetes. An average doesn't mean that much. Diagnostics are done by fasting or more accurately A1C.As for symptoms, everyone is different. Most prediabetics don't experience symptoms at all. Some Type 2 diabetics experience symptoms such as fatigue, thirst and increased urination, some don't. To have frequent symptoms usually it is necessary to have had pretty high blood sugars for awhile. I would check other possible explanations for your fatigue.",

            "answer": "The cutoffs are cut and dry, and if a doctor says a person with 103 fasting or with 5.7 A1C is not pre-diabetic, they are incorrect. Some doctors hesitate to \"diagnose\" pre-diabetes for various reasons (insurance criteria, belief that patients will be \"non-compliant\" ), but the diagnosis is based on the numbers. You would be amazed how little doctors know about diabetes. The American Diabetes Association lowered the criteria for fasting bg to diagnose pre-diabetes from 110 to 100 in 1998. (prior to that 110-139 was considered pre-diabetic and 140 and over diabetic.) Many more people are now diagnosed with pre-diabetes and given the opportunity to slow or prevent progression to diabetes. There are some people who believe the cutoffs should be lowered again.",

If you are asking about a person without diabetes, anything below 5.7 is considered normal. Not at risk? It is hard to say who will go on to develop either type of diabetes, with genetics and insulin resistance as factors. The best anyone can do is improve lifestyle factors such as healthy eating, exercise, and healthy weight level. This helps a lot with development of Type 2.",

I am hypoglycemic (reactive). My blood sugar after fasting is as high as it gets. After I eat, it drops. But a superficial look at my blood test results might have a doctor warn me about diabetes.

You're right we just assume doctors and tests are right, when in fact there are lots of exceptions to the rules. I think it's a good thing they are switching from using fasting to using A1C to make initial diagnosis, though even that has its flaws as well.\u00a0\u00a0I think numbers are always pretty arbitrary cutoffs. Like 99 not being pre-diabetes and 100 is, or 5.6 A1C is fine, but 5.7 isn't. But I also feel that the more people get diagnosed as pre-diabetes the better because they then have an opportunity to slow or even prevent the advancement of the condition, instead of waiting until they already have symptoms and complications have already started to develop.",

After drinking that horrible stuff my blood sugar started to fall and kept falling. It went below 50 and did not start to recover (very slightly) by the time I left. My doctor ( a different genius) said I didn't have diabetes. Big surprise, right? He did not address the hypoglycemia issue considering it unimportant, or nonexistent.

However, that is the past 3 months and the situation now that he knows is different.Since your husband is now home, has lost weight and is watching his diet it appears he has made some really big improvements in his blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0 If he continues this way, in 3 months, his next hba1c should be much lower.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe in the 5s and nearly normal.I would recommend that your husband continues home monitoring, writing down his blood sugar for fasting and 2 hours after eating (including what he eats).\u00a0\u00a0He should then take this to his doctor and request that he be allowed to continue monitoring and if he can maintain his blood sugar in the current range of 80 - 120, which is essentially normal, he should not be taking meds.Of course he may now need to keep monitoring and be vigilent about his diet to maintain his progress and stop his sugars rising again.Do not take the diabetic medicine while his blood sugars are still 'normal'.\u00a0\u00a0If he takes this medicine he may end up having low blood sugar, which is also not a good option.",
