            "answer": "Thanks guys! It's so nice to know someone cares and praying. You don't know what that means to me.I anwered on the other post if you want to read that. I'm going to try the Zoloft and Neurontin. Venora, do you know anything about that second one? I thought the Olanzapine seemed to have too many side effects like the weight gain and risk of diabetes. I told the doctor that we have an awful lot of diabetes in our family and didn't want to risk that. I'm not sure I really like this guy but he's not the one she'll continue to see. He's just the one in the clinic where she's at right now. I'm going to call a child psychiatrist that I understand is a Christian. I hope it will work this time. She's tried counseling before and it helped some but didn't see huge changes. The doctor said he doesn't believe that she has bipolar but that she's suffering from PTSD and that she can carry this throughout life. I'm not going to look at it so pessimistically. I believe that God can do a miracle and touch her bring her to wholeness but she has to be willing to turn to God. Right now she's mad at God and doesn't want much to do with Him. Just got to keep praying. This is so hard on me. I'm hurting so badly too.You've got a point about taking care of myself. I haven't slept real well or eaten real well. I'm so stressed and uptight right now. I can feel it. I know that I have to be careful because I've already got GI issues with the Crohns and ulcers and stuff.Yeah, a lot has happened in our family these last couple of years. It's been extremely stressful. My husband and I were fighting yesterday too. We don't always agree on what's best for her. We're both just so stressed right now that we're snapping at each other. We had to make a conscious effort to apologize and we went out to lunch today but it was a bit hurried and we're still rather uptight. I'm not giving up though.I haven't given up on God or blamed him. I have every reason to but I can't. He's the only real hope I have.It's nice to know I have some online friends who care! :) Thank you so much. I'll keep in touch. God bless.",
