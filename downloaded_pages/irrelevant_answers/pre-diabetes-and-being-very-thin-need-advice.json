            "answer": "Yes, a fasting glucose of 107 mg/dl is considered prediabetes. The fasting glucose ranges are:70-99 mg/dl Normal100-125 mg/dl PrediabetesAbove 126 mg/dl Type 2 diabetesSince diabetes runs in your family ask your doctor for an A1c [HbA1c] test. See this link for an explanation.http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/a1c-test/MY0102An 8oz glass of milk contains on average 8 grams of sugar, every 7 grams equals one heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar. That alone will jack your postprandial [after meal] glucose levels upwards. Oatmeal spiced with cinnamon and fruits is my usual breakfast. A much better choice than synthetic fiber.For weight its best to sit down with a nutritionist to go over your foods and serving sizes - what you should eat and cannot eat. Ask your doctor for a referral. Major teaching hospitals found on or near major university campuses have trained nutritionist's on staff.",

            "answer": "Hi,It may be helpful if you are able to buy a glucose monitor so that you could monitor your blood sugars after eating and see which foods / combinations of foods don't affect your blood sugar adversely.Eating foods higher in fat and protein can maintain your calorie consumption, even while controlling your carbs to help you avoid losing weight.You may also find that you can eat more carbs later in the day than earlier.\u00a0\u00a0Some people eating the same carbs at breakfast and lunch would only find that the breakfast increases their blood sugar.Get educated.\u00a0\u00a0In an ideal world your fasting levels would be less than 95 and your 2 hour after eating would be less than 120, with maximum blood sugar at any time not exceeding 140 (which is the level above which damage has been shown to occur).Your doctor should also be testing your HA1C to see what is really happening.Normal HA1C has been shown to be about 4.7 (even though the reference range goes up to about 6.1), and ideally should be under 5.",

You might be able to continue with your usual breakfast and you might not. I can't eat any cereal at all and my regular breakfast is some kind of eggs. To keep your weight up, yes a nutritionist is best, but meanwhile eat things like plenty of protein, and there is no reason for your to avoid dairy. I also agree that amount of carbs is a personal thing. Some diabetics eat very low carb, some like me eat moderate/low and some don't adjust carbs at all. See how various carbs affect your blood sugar to keep you in range. Controlling pre-diabetes or diabetes with just diet and exercise is a balancing act but can be done and there is no reason you should be hungry or lose weight which you can't afford to do.Btw if you progress to full diabetes, do make sure you get a correct diagnosis of Type.",

            "answer": "Glucose testing times are:1. Fasting [prandial] before breakfast - no food or colored liquids for 8-10 hours. This gives a baseline on what you ate the night before and how\u00a0\u00a0you body functions while sleeping.2. Before meals to get a baseline reading to compare against the after meal [postprandial] reading.3. After meals [postprandial] 2-3 hours. This is when glucose from foods peak in your body. I aim for 2.5 hours as the best medium. Depending on what you have consumed 2 hours, I have found, sometimes gives a false positive. When first starting, I tested at 3 and 4 hours out of curiosity.The postprandial level depends on what your doctor recommends. Ask why she believes \"the range\" is best suited for you. Most doctors and hospitals still consider <180 mg/dl as the norm. Only lately have we seen 140 mg/dl and <180 mg/dl causes any harm. Aim for the lower number, common sense says the higher you go the potential for long term harm exists.Finally, I no longer follow the ADA [American Diabetes Association] recommendations nor suggest their guidelines. The ADA is now sponsored by major drug firms. Its kinda like the fox watching over the chicken coop.",
