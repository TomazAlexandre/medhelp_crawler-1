            "answer": "Take it one step at a time. My worst part of surgery was gas pain two weeks after. I had to get up and walk, and walk and walk to pass the gas. I walked every chance I got. My CA125 was 293 and 75 after surgery. After chemo it is 12. Ovarian is often referred to as a Chronic illness like diabetes. I am a year out and riding horses and back to being a full time artist. My next adventure is ziplining.Alex",

    "question": "Hey everyone, I posted last week talking about my mum that was in the process of being diagnosed with ovarian cancer. Well we went to see the Gyn/Onc the other day who confiremd that mum had a 5cm cyst on her right ovary..and that her CA-125 levels had come back at 245...is that high? He seemed to indicated that sometimes women with ovarian cancer can have levels well into the thousands.So she has an operation scheduled for the 30th to have a total hystorectomy. Despite her having other tests such as a CT scan to scan the lymphic system, he did not say whether anything had spread anywhere...no news if good news I guess. So all in all quite relieved. I guess anyone who has been through this would realise that the mind can start playing tricks on you...especially after just last week at work someone retired after being told they have terminal cancer which is just awful. We seem to have a way forward now with a possible opportunity that this could maybe be cured with surgery. Any thoughts are most welcome. xxxx Hope you are all having a good day and again thanks for your support xxx",
