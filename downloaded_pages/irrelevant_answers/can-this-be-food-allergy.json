            "answer": "Hello there,Some people can be allergic to the gluten in bread products. You can also be allergic to wheat. What kind of bread do you eat ? How much bread do you eat ?\u00a0\u00a0A friend of mine is allergic to guten. Gluten is in many kinds of food including bread. Her allergy to gluten was discovered through a blood test. She no longer eats any products with gluten. There is a really interesting book written by David Permutter MD called \" Grain Brain\".I'm reading right now as a matter of fact.\u00a0\u00a0All the symptoms you are describing such as fatigue, dizziness, feeling anxious, depression can be caused from an allergy to wheat and gluten.\u00a0\u00a0You should try and buy this book . It's a real eye opener. The friend I spoke of that is allergic to wheathad a blood test done not through her doctor but it was done by a specialist.\u00a0\u00a0This could probably be done by a blood lab, but it is a special food allergy test and you need a referral by your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you.
