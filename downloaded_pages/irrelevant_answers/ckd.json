            "answer": "Hello,welcome here.One of the most important factors for controlling or even potentially reversing Chronic Kidney Disease, if it is caused by diabetes, is to have excellent control of blood sugar.So questions are:1. What is your Hba1c.\u00a0\u00a0A normal hba1c is < 5.0.\u00a0\u00a0If you want to control your diabetes well you should be aiming for an hba1c as close to 5 as you can safely manage.2. Are you monitoring your blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0What is your typical fasting and post eating numbers?\u00a0\u00a0Ideally fasting blood sugar is < 95 (ideal is in the mid 80s).\u00a0\u00a0Post eating should be < 140, but ideally < 120 (people who are totally non-diabetic will tend not to have much if any rise in blood sugar above 90 regardless of what you eat.\u00a0\u00a0I am telling this so you know what normal is and what your targets ideally are.If you cannot take metformin (and presumably none of the other oral meds), the best treatment choice will be insulin.3.\u00a0\u00a0To control your blood sugar naturally, you need a combination of diet, exercise and weight management.- optimize weight- exercise daily with light to moderate intensity (at least).\u00a0\u00a0It may be helpful if you exercise after eating.- follow a low carb, moderate protein diet.\u00a0\u00a0This will necessarily involve increasing your fat intake so you have enough calories, and nutrition.use your blood sugar meter to determine which foods don't have impact on your blood sugar.Eat as natural a diet as you can, minimizing grains, sugars, fruits, and with plenty of non-starchy veges.\u00a0\u00a0Fruits such as olive, avocado are ok.",

            "answer": "Hello.........you are not alone...I have been having effects of metformin and glipizide since May 27, 2015.\u00a0\u00a0I am going into the clinic tomorrow.\u00a0\u00a0My pharmacist said \"oh there is a bug going around\". This is clearly not a bug this is either the meds are in too warm of a temperature and not being as effective or I've got another kidney infection. Been up with abdominal pain, bloating, gas ..just can't get comfortable and my numbers are not coming down as fast as they were. Soooooooo it's time to get it checked out and see what the tests say.\u00a0\u00a0I have been on metformin for years but they just changed companies (I hate when pharmacist do this and don't tell you). Glipizide used to pick up the slack time of metformin..not happening lately. So I am not gonna analyze this in my head no more time for a visit. Good Luck\u00a0\u00a0to you. I would do the same...check out any changes in the brand or your habits.",
