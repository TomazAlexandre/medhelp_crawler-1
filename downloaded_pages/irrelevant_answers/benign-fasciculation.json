            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. Sinusitis, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, and ear infection can cause numbness/tingling at temple, ear and top of eye. Usually medications will cause a more generalized side effect. Please discuss with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
