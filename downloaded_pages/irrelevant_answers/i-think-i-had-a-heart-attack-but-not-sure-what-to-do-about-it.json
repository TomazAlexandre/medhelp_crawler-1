            "answer": "I'll just add that heart attacks in women can manifest themselves differently than in men. You may not have the typical chest crushing pain or pain in the jaw.Whatever is making you feel this sick should be diagnosed. Heart, low blood sugar, blood pressure problems: all can be dangerous but can also be treated.",

    "question": "Im a 40 year old female and a few months ago I went to the beach with my husband. We were sitting outside having lunch and\u00a0\u00a0it was hot out. My husband got me a drink, I only had one and I started to get heartburn really bad. This went on for 10 minutes or so and then it started to let up. We decided to walk to the store and get me some tums and when we got there and went inside I started to get really dizzy. I went to the ladies room where I ended up laying on the floor before I fell down. I broke out into a horrible sweat and was drenched. I dont know how long I was laying there, my ears were ringing and finally I felt well enough to get up and open the door, I guess people had been knocking and my husband said I was very pale and I asked him to take me home. Did I have a heart attack? This isnt the first time this has happened, it has happened before in the past, one other time. Scared to death, I dont have insureance at the moment since I got laid of from my job. What else could cause this to happen, any ideas welcome..",
