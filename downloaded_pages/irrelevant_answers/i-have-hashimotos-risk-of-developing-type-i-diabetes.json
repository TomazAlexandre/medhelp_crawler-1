            "answer": "There are a cluster of autoimmune diseases more commonly seen with Hashimoto's thyroiditis due to genetic factors.\u00a0\u00a0The listed % of risk for another autoimmune disease if you already have one is, from what I've read, 14% to 25%. From the list below I have pernicious anaemia, vitiligo, alopecia areta, Hashimoto's thyroiditis. My Hashi's showed up last decades later.Excerpt from the book \"The Everything Guide To Thyroid Disease\" by Theodore C. Friedman, MD, PhD and Winnie Yu Scherer:\"Although the majority of people with Hashimoto's will not develop any other disorders, it's important to know what some of these autoimmune conditions are in case you do start to experience symptoms. Keep in mind, too, that you may be more likely to develop Hashimoto's if you have one of these other conditions.Type 1 diabetesPernicious AnaemiaAddison's DiseaseVitiligoCeliac DiseaseAlopecia AretaSystematic Lupus Erthematosus (SLE)Rheumatoid ArthritisSjogren's SyndromeInflammatory Bowel DiseaseMultiple Sclerosis (MS)\"",

            "answer": "Hi there,If you have one autoimmune disease, there are chances to develop other autoimmune diseases, unless if you don't take yourself very well. Food matters the most,follow a healthy diet. Try to reduce the inflammation, just listen to your body to do good for your body. Clean up the gut. Some supplements may help you to reduce the inflammation, zinc, selenium, magnesium,Glutamine, probiotics and a good quality fish oil. Try to eat some fermented food. And of course try to smile:)",

    "question": "I'm male, and was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroiditis about 5 years ago, but felt the symptoms for years prior. I'm on a daily regimen of Synthroid. While researching ways to manage this condition, I found various websites linking Hashimoto's and Type I diabetes together. This has me somewhat freaking out! It seems like people who develop Type I diabetes can also complicate to Hashimoto's, but I haven't seen any reading about the other way around. How common is it for people to develop Type I diabetes if they have Hashimoto's first?Thank you everyone.",
