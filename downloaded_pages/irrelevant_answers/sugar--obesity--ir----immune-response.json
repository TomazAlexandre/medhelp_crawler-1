My cousin was telling me he lost about 25-30 pounds by diet change and his wife added that it was mostly by breaking off his relationship with Little Debbie products.",

            "answer": "This is one of those presentations in which one needs to possibly watch it a few times to catch more, but one of the I believe that the message is that we are eating more and more sugar; they are putting it in everything.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, in bread, it is in my canned tomatoes, etc.\u00a0\u00a0So #1 we are facing a higher intake of sugar than EVER before.#2.... and this would be in CAPS, that HFCS.....High Fructose Corn Syrup if radically different than regular sugars.\u00a0\u00a0It is metabolized differently;\"Fructose is not glucose\"\u00a0\u00a043:00\"What the liver does to fructose is really unique\" 43:05----------------Fructose is not glucose-----------------------1)\u00a0\u00a0Fructose is 7 times more likely than glucose to form Advanced Glycation End-products (AGE's)2)\u00a0\u00a0Fructose does not Suppress ghrelin3)\u00a0\u00a0Acute fructose does not stimulate insulin (or leptin)4)\u00a0\u00a0Hepatic fructose metabolism is different.5)\u00a0\u00a0Chronic fructose metabolism promotes Metabolic Syndrome.44:30Chronic fructose exposure alone, nothing else, causes this thing we call the Metabolic Syndrome.....everybody knows what the metabolic syndrome is? This is the conglomerate of the following different phenomena; obesity, type 2 diabetes, lipid problems, hypertension, and cardiovascular disease.\u00a0\u00a0Those all cluster together.\u00a0\u00a044:40This is worth a view.This presentation is of import to regular, so called healthy people and .....i believe.... that it has even greater importance to people with liver disease.Since our immune response may also be impacted by sugar this may further impact upon us.\u00a0\u00a0This presentation does not really address that subject.------------------------a little more.......51:24Ethanol is a carbohydrateCH3-Ch2-OHBut ethanol is also a toxin;--------------------------------Acute Ethanol (alcohol) exposure------------------------CNS DepressionVasodiatation decreased blood pressureHypothermiaTachocardiaMyocardial depressionVarial pupilary responsesRespiratory depressionDiuresishypoglycemiaLoss of motor controlACUTE FRUCTOSE EXPOSURE.....causes none of theseHe talks about how alcohol affects the liver, and how alcohol causes cirrhosis at about 53:00Basically, when you consume 120 calories of sugar a limited amount of those calories end up being metabolized in the liver.\u00a0\u00a0OTOH, when you consume alcohol, about 4 times the amount of those calories end up being metabolized by the liver.He then proceeds to explain who HFCS ends up being metabolized almost exactly the same as alcohol.This is very serious if you are healthy.\u00a0\u00a0If you have liver disease it is much more serious.\u00a0\u00a0He does not go into this in the talk, but I urge people to spend the time and to start looking at the food one eats and the sugar type and quantity that you partake.willy",

            "answer": "Thanks for posting, Willy. I have always felt sugar, especially corn sugar (high fructose corn syrup) which is in almost every commercial product one eats (not just baked goods and sweets, but in canned produce, cereal products includine baked products, drinks, hot dogs, lunch meats, sauces, literally almost everything commercially made).There have been several studies on some indigenous groups (some Native America groups, some Indigenous Australian groups, and others) which show that when they switch from their normal diets to a Western diet high in sugars and processed foods, they gain a tremendous amout of weight and/or become diabetic. They also develop other diseases such as heart disease. When a group of Indigenous Australians returned to homeland and their normal diets and activity, their chronic illnesses improved dramatically.Here is an interesting article on Indigenous people and the effect of the Western diet.http://ncp.sagepub.com/content/25/6/585.full",

    "question": "I wanted to put this on THIS side of the forum.\u00a0\u00a0It may not be about HCV per se..... but it may pertain to immune response, damage progression, success with treatment.It is not possible to tie it all together in one post, but I think that this may be worth looking into this.We are eating and drinking way more sugar in our diet.\u00a0\u00a0This may cause our weight to go up, this may contribute to our becoming IR, which in part can lower our response to treatment.\u00a0\u00a0I have not seen data or studies on it, but I infer that this same issue may also speed our damage progression.Now.......if I were to start a thread as a newbie and ask how much booze I can drink..... while I have HCV, the whole forum will give them a stern lecture. .......and we are right to do it.......the same might go for smoking pot.Now...... how often do we talk about sugar intake?I'm going to leave 2-3 links just for you to consider;----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Toxic Sugar: Should We Regulate It Like Alcohol?http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/02/02/sugar-toxic-regulation_n_1248397.html?ref=health-news&ir=Health%20News----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Sugar: The Bitter Truth\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0(Utube)http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dBnniua6-oM------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I would also mention that if our diet is rapidly changing, and if damage is related to sugar/IR, then we might expect worse damage if we adapt to higher sugar intake.I know that Mercola is considered to be controversial by people.\u00a0\u00a0This is his take on sugar; we don't have to agree on every point, but I just offer it for your consideration.------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------The 76 Dangers of Sugar to Your Healthhttp://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/04/20/sugar-dangers.aspxAnyway...... just a little something to think about.willy---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------",
