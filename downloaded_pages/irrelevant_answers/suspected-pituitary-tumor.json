            "answer": "He can outline the symptoms above, and get the usual testing to rule out the normal stuff that causes them.Get an eye exam (that can point to issues), get blood tests and see what comes out.Certainly the weight loss should make them run tests to see what is up. Oddly, I went for the unintended weight loss - and they found nothing - but I was in a Cushing's cycle and so in a low cycle, all the tests are normal. Getting a pituitary tumor diagnosed is not a cake walk - I am actually amazed that some people tell me they get diagnosed right away - but it took me 12\u00a0\u00a0years. I know someone it took 35 years. A decade is not unusual. My tumor was even seen. I think things are a bit better nowadays, but then I hear stuff and still think doctors are not yet educated.So be patient, get copies of everything, and learn as much as you can. It may be another hormonal issue - thyroid comes to mind.",

            "answer": "Hello, I had an Adenoma of the pituitary ( since removed by transphenoidal surgery) My tumor was the cause of me FINALLY getting diagnosed with Cushings disease.I know\u00a0\u00a0that not every person has the same symptoms, I don't know if men have the same symptoms as women though. In most cases of women I know about, who had Cushings their symptoms included...Weight gain, loss of menstral sycle, getting facial hair and darker hair on arms and legs, balding, thin arms and legs with a larger body trunk, a buffalo hump on the back of the neck, raised blood sugars (Diabetes), blurry vision (can be caused by Diabetes)\u00a0\u00a0thin skin w/ easy brusing, dark stretch marks appearing on skin, high blood pressure, etc.... not to mention the havoc it causes on your inside organs! Can I ask, why you think you may have a pituitary tumor? Is it just a hunch, or has anyone in your family or someone you know had one? Just curious.",
