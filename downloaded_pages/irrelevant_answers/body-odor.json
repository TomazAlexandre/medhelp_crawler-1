            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Primary hyperhidrosis is thought to be because of sympathetic nervous system overactivity. Hence anxiety can exacerbate the situation as it releases those hormones that help in fight and flight. A common complaint of patients is that they get nervous because they sweat, then sweat more because they are nervous. Other factors can play a role; certain foods & drinks, nicotine, caffeine, and smells can trigger a response.You have got some tests done. Please go through this and see if all causes have been covered or not. Endocrine gland related conditions like hyperthyroidism, acromegaly and diabetes all result in increased sweating. Pheochromocytoma, cancers, carcinoid syndromes, tuberculosis and other infections too can cause increased sweating.Wear loose clothes. Carry an astringent and a deodorant. Do not be over anxious about this as this will increase sweating. Easier said than done, but you have to try meditation and yoga to calm your self. Avoid too much of tea, coffee, smoking and spicy food. Reducing cheese and protein in diet also help a few.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "thank you. I just don't know what to do because I have to wait until I am 16 to get all of those tests in Minnesota. makes no sense to me but any ideas on what I can do until then?I try not to feel sorry for myself but its affecting everything and my parents don't even believe just how bad off I am. In fact my dad plays it down and laughs at me everytime it comes up in an arguement which are becoming more frequent because I am becoming more and more frustrated with myself. Like I said, I had blood work done before school and the OBGYN ruled out anything down there. I don't have any odd swelling, any deformities or odd coloring and all my cuts heal just fine. However I have problems with having an excessivley dark colored neck which requires at least 3 clearasil acne wipes to clean. I can smell alot of what I eat on me. For example, I drank soy milk before school and it made me reak really bad like rotted diary milk. I seem to have a base smell of urine and sometimes cat urine and then in the morning house hold cleaners. Any ideas?\u00a0\u00a0oh yeah, I also have problems with irreagular bowel movements which started about half a year ago. I have frequent bouts of constipation followed by diarrhea which always gives me grief with gas during the day and bloating however there is no funny coloration. Could all of these be signs of something together? I need to start thinking of things I can bring up with the doctor for when that day comes. Or any solutions because talc, bathing multiple times a day and changing clothes doesn't reduce it, It alters it.Again, thank you.",

    "question": "Hello. This is my first post of any kind like this so I am kind of anxious about this but I am very desperate!To get to the point I was wondering if anxiety of any kind can cause body odor. I have had no help about this on the internet because they all say the same things like, it is normal for everyone or that you have to shower regularly. But for me, this is a bunch of frustrating bull.This has been going on now for 5 years when I was 11 or so. It began midly to the point where no one noticed the odor I was giving off in my private areas. However, one day in the 6th grade about 3 weeks into September I abruptly began to over sweat my deodorant then it spread to my groin area. The smell keeps changing some in variety but it always evolves around this strange scent off well, groin even in my armpitts. People don't want to sit next to me anymore and some have even spoke loudly of a horrible smell when I was around three feet away. I used to think I was lactose Intolerant becuase I used to get stomach cramps when drinking milk. I stopped consuming dairy but the smell didn't change. I used to not have problems with my bowels but that started recently too at the end of last year. Both problems seem to minimize some when I am not in school which makes me wonder is it anxiety or is it hope that during weekends and breaks I am normal?I am diagnoised with hyperhidrosis and I was given a perscription for a solution. I put it on my armpitts and my upper/inner thighs all around. My arm pitts don't sweat near as much but I over sweat it right away \"down there\". The smell doesn't go away at all in either region.I tend to be very passive to the point where at school especially I have a hard time getting upset or liking anything. But this issue has broken through that and is frustrating me to hell and back. That is why i want to drop out of school and take on-line classes but I know I will be avoiding the problem.If anyone can think of anyother health problems that may be causing this please speak up. By the way I had blood work done lately and they did not diagnose me with any disease like diabetes or anything so as far as i know I am a clean slate. I have lost 20 pounds recently, that didn't help. Talc or baby powders only modify the smell and make it 10 times more noticable. I drink about 6 glasses of water a day and try to eat salad with every dinner and fruit with every lunch. That doesn't help either. I even exerscise by walking home from school and walking my dog when I am not playing my instruments. This doesn't help at all.I sincerely thank you if you read this long post.",
