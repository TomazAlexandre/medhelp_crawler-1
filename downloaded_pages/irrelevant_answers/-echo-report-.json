            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The report is not clear. What was the final impression? There is mild mitral regurgitation and left ventricular hypertrophy. But the ejection fraction is good. The ejection fraction is a useful measure of left ventricular performance. The normal range is 63-77% for males and 55-75% for females. It reflects the pumping capacity of the heart.Check to see if you have hypertension, this could cause left ventricular hypertrophy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
