            "answer": "I was diagnosed as well and everyone is different. Some people are able to manage their sugars by diet, others need meds of some sort. Personally I needed to go on glyberide as well as diet management. I test my blood sugars 4 times a day to ensure that my little guy is in a well managed environment. I am currently 36+3 weeks and my little man is measuring at 7lbs 12oz already so he is large. My doctors said that due to his size they will likely enduce early (only a week maybe 2), but with any failure to progress could lead to a c-section. Again everyone has different experiences and just listen to what your body and the doctors are telling you. Good luck with everything!",
