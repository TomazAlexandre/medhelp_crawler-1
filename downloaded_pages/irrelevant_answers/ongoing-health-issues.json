            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!I am sorry to hear about your health. You need to consult a good endocrine specialist to manage your thyroid better and a good gynecologist to manage the PCOS. Apart from this diabetes and liver problems could also be adding to the weight.\u00a0\u00a0Hence it is very important to catch hold of a good endocrine specialist.There are various approaches to treat a polycystic ovary. First of all insulin resistance has to be checked and corrected by a dose of metformin. Then regular check ups have to be scheduled and you put on low dose birth control pills to regularize the cycles first. Once this is corrected, regular ultrasounds will be done to assess the status of the ovum and accordingly drugs prescribed. At times laproscopy is done and cysts punctured. Diet and weight control are also important part of therapy and you need to be under a good nutrition expert.Proper management of PCOS, liver, thyroid and diabetes can make you feel more energetic and help you lose weight. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "When I had my last OB/Gyn appt (summer 2009) to check on the PCOS and to look for additional problems to consider a hysterectomy/bladder rehang, they didn't show any cysts on my ovaries at that time.\u00a0\u00a0I need to go back for my annual, but the other issues I am facing (liver, spleen, diabetes) are taking priority right now. I am currently on 500mg daily of the Metformin for the diabetes.I have been advised by friends that have thyroid issues that a good endocrinologist might be able to help.\u00a0\u00a0I will try that route next.I have tried desperately to loose weight over the last many years with little/no success.\u00a0\u00a0I recently dropped 7-10 lbs with the increase in the thyroid meds, adding the metformin and being very restricted on diet due to the diabetes, stomach and liver issues.\u00a0\u00a0I want to incorporate exercise into the plan as well, but when you have no energy and feel horrible every day... its hard.",
