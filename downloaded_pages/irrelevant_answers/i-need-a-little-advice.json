            "answer": "Good grief, the kid is 15 years old! What kid is ready to have sex at 15?! He should be thinking about sports and getting his drivers license. I think we should be encouraging him to wait. This is a big responsibility. Too many kids are taking on adult responsibilites without thinking it through and realizing the reprecusions of what they're doing, such as pregnancy, STD's, not to mention the emotional devestation that can result when they're girlfriend/boyfriend dumps them. Giving your body to someone is one of the most precious, vulnerable things you can do. It shouldn't be taken lightly. Call me old fashioned, but if you ask most people, they will tell you that they regretted having sex so young because they weren't ready. I wish teens today would realize that it's ok to wait until marraige. They should never be made to feel pressured into something this important.",

            "answer": "You said it, April2! I read this post and I was going to comment on it, but haven't gotten to it until now.I was thinking, this kid is 15 with a g/f of two years, and says she's not a virgin. So she was just 12 or 13 years old when she started having sex?! And now she wants to do it with this guy and is getting \"frustrated\" with him.I had been 16 for a month when I lost my virginity to my now-ex-b/f, and boy I'll tell you what, if I could take that moment back, I would seriously consider it (but now I have my son, and I wouldn't give him up for the world, so that's where I have mixed feelings about changing my past if I could).But anyway, I feel sorry for teens in this situation. They're just raging with hormones and super horny (please excuse my phrasing), and they come here asking what they should do with themselves. Why aren't they asking their parents? And then they come here and I wonder, why are *adults* giving them advice on how to go through with this?! Then those adults are the ones who say in the next post, why are teens these days getting pregnant and getting STDs and why are they so sexualized?Good God, I know I will do everything I can to keep communication like this completely open with my son when he gets this age, and I certainly will provide major supervision of him around girls when he's this age.To the OP--it's not worth it if she's the one initiating this and getting \"frustrated\" with you. You've got you're whole life ahead of you and someone in your future with whom you'd rather share your virginity. Trust me. I've been there, done that. It ain't worth it.",

            "answer": "Hi Matty. I would also like to encourage you to wait on the sex. You are VERY young. Sex is such a physical and EMOTIONAL experience. Please don't ever let anyone pressure you into anything, even sex. Sex is wonderful and great believe me. But you have a long life to experience this. One day you will grow into a man and fall in love with a woman who you love more than life itself. At some point when you think back on your life, you will realize that you are not the only person this woman has had sex with (and vice versa). I think that you can find alot of other ways to satisfy yourself and each other with the intercourse, if that is truly what you BOTH are interested in.I think teenagers have a tendency to only live for TODAY, think about later on down the road, please. I am certainly not a goody two shoes by any means. I am speaking from experience. Please don't rush it. Some day you will have a beautiful sexual relationship with someone who means the world to you. Take my advice on this one, and please wait. Sex has sooooo many complications that come along with it when it is not \"right\".",

If\u00a0\u00a0your girlfriend is pressuring you to have sex, imagine how your life would change if she somehow got pregnant. I have a son who is 14 and I tell him all the time to THINK FOR YOURSELF. You know what is right and what is wrong... if someone wants you to do something that you KNOW is wrong and you do it, then you are a follower. You will then suffer the consequences of these decisions. BE a leader!Best of luck",

You got advice from everyone, and good advice too--just not everything you wanted to hear.Some of us said, yes, your diabetes probably has something to do with your problem. Go to a doctor for more info if you're concerned. That's good advice.Others said, okay, you have a problem, but don't concern yourself too much about it, because you are so young and have so much to experience as a teen that should have priority over sex. That's good advice too, but probably not what you want to hear. Sorry, but it is good advice.No one was telling you to \"$%#! off\" or imply that you don't know anything and we're smarter than you. However, we're all older and more experienced (not smarter) than you with not only sex, but life in general.Your responses show your age.Whatever you do, good luck.",
