            "answer": "I listened to a blog talk radio with Dr. Berkson from July 31st . (It was hard to listen to as it was very interrupted from technical difficulties caused by a storm.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Berkson said he has been having very good results using Low Dose Naltrexone for autoimmune disorders of many kinds.\u00a0\u00a0You need a prescription for Low dose naltrexone which doesn't have any serious side effects because it is a tiny dose taken at bedtime which blocks your opiate receptors causing a build of endorphins which are later released having\u00a0\u00a0a immune modulating effect.\u00a0\u00a0It is doing very well for a lot of people with a variety of immune issues.\u00a0\u00a0It is not expensive either.\u00a0\u00a0We got enough for 100 days for around $50.00 from Skip's Pharmacy (compounding Pharmacy).\u00a0\u00a0They specialize in it and mail it to people from all over.\u00a0\u00a0Since it is such a tiny dose it has to be used with a filler added to the capsule.\u00a0\u00a0There are yahoo groups sharing their experience with it.\u00a0\u00a0I have been at the one for adults and children with hepatitis and CAM.\u00a0\u00a0(I think that is what it is called.) Mhudnall on medhelp has been posting his experiences with LDN . He was also left with some bad auto-immune problems from his brief time on Interferon/Riba combo.It makes me sick that you are going through this because I was so happy for your SVR.Best wishes,Ev",

    "question": "Hi All,I was an active member of this site until March 2008 when I began treatment (SOC+Alinia-- geno 1a, 70 million VL, diabetes, F1 liver damage, very symptomatic).\u00a0\u00a0I'm UND according to 3 mo post tx PCR.\u00a0\u00a0Of course I'm happy to reach UND but now have serious HCV-related autoimmune diabetes which is the body attacking the islet cells of the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0This condition has proved extremely difficult to control and not caused by tx as I was diagnosed in 2007.I'm conveying this for the sake of those who may be weighing the pros and cons of treatment.\u00a0\u00a0My HCV went undiagnosed for 27 years despite my complaints to numerous doctors, ample enough time to ravage vital cell functions in the WHOLE body.\u00a0\u00a0The liver alone is involved in over 300 chemical processes.I avoided treatment for 3 years while reading all the posts on this board.\u00a0\u00a0BTW, it was the knowledge here that gave me the confidence to treat.\u00a0\u00a0It was extremely unpleasant but I did it.\u00a0\u00a0I finished 4 months ago and now it's just a vague memory.\u00a0\u00a0I just wish I treated sooner and I maybe I wouldn't have diabetes.Kittyface",
