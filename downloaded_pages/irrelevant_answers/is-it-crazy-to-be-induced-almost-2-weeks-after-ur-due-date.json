            "answer": "Weight gain doesn't matter in terms of induction unless you are swelling or have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Have they checked to see the size of the baby yet?\u00a0\u00a0I'm 35.5 weeks and my doc. said he would induce 6 days before my due date- it's already on the books- our 3 year old has a G-tube for feeding so it's not an option but to have family in town as I can't just give him to a friend so there are other circumstances but I think 42 weeks is the absolute end of the limit however, many doctors do not believe in inducing but if they weight moret han 42 weeks the placenta starts to break down.\u00a0\u00a0My friend gained 103 pounds with her first and did the same as you- worked out, ate healthy and was a nurse working 12 hour shifts.\u00a0\u00a0Her daughter weighed 6 pounds 2 oz and she lost all of her weight but your doc. will NOT induce based on your weight.\u00a0\u00a0My hubby is 6'4\" and weighs 280 with not an ounce of fat on him so I've always banked on a big baby but so far, it hasn't happened. My daughter was 7 lbs 8 oz and my son was 7 lbs. 9 oz. so you just\u00a0\u00a0never know.\u00a0\u00a0It isn't uncommon for a doc. to wait 2 weeks after your due date to induce though.\u00a0\u00a0Ask for an ultrasound so you have an idea of the size of the baby but I guarantee you the baby isn't gaining that much, it's probably just your body doing what it needs to do.\u00a0\u00a0I go today to the perinatologist for his measurements so I can't wait to see what mine weighs.\u00a0\u00a0He was 4 lbs 8 oz a month ago so we'll see!!!\u00a0\u00a0Take care and discuss this with your doc. if you are really concerned. I'm sure he has concrete reasons for all of this decisions.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "Hon...I think you will have her before that.....42 wks your placenta is aged and may not properly support enough food/oxygen going to the baby....I wouldnt worry about that 2 wk post due date.On your weight gain...we are all different.\u00a0\u00a0Ive lost almost 50 and you have gained it.....no worries. Focus on a healthy baby....we can lose weight latter. Not to mention if you breast feed the weight will fall off you.",
