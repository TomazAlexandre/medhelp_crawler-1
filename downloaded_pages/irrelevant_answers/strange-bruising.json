    "question": "Hey,Recently I've been getting random bruises on my right arm. I'm not quite sure what's causing them. Most seem to start as one little speck that then expand. One completely encompassed my wrist, and many people thought that I was being abused when I'm not. Most of the bruises stay at a deep, dark purple for a long time, and the next color they stay the longest is a disconcerting, oily yellow color. If anyone knows what it is, it would be much appreciated. It's starting to interfere with my daily life.P.s. The bruises all appear on my right forearm. I did break my right arm at the elbow around eight years ago, if that matters. Also, all of the bruises seem to start around a visible vein in my arm, then start spreading into different directions.Thanks for your help in advance! :)",
