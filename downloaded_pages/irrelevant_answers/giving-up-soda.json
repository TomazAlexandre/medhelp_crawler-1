    "question": "So I am a faithful mellow yellow drinker, I just never have a taste for anything other. Every now and then I'll have a glass of juice say with breakfast. Of course since I am 6 weeks pregnant I have been drinking PLENTY of Apple/oragne/cranberry grape juice plus water but is it okay to enjoy at least one 20 fl oz of soda?!?! Not necessarily daily but just to fill my craving. I literally feel bad even taking a sip of soda. I am a first time mom so every move I make I question...please tell me there is someone who can relate and make me feel more confident in sipping soda",
