    "question": "Since November I've had intense vaginal itching, so much to the point of chafing. I went to the doc, and she said I had a bacterial infection, and gave me antibiotics. Mind you, I AM on birth control, and had been previously taking antibiotics for an ear infection. So, I was thinking I had the YI from the antibiotics. But, the bacterial infection, I had a LOT of discharge and there was an odor. The second time I went, I had a test, and she said I def had a yeast infection, and she was concerned because there were a lot of white blood cells. She put me on Diflucan, and I took both doses and STILL had the YI. I heard your body can be resistant to Diflucan, so I got OTC Monistat and...of course I still have the itching and some discharge. It's not as intense, but it's still annoying. I've been tested for diabetes, and my gyno asked me if I've been tested for HIV, which concerned me. I was tested for everything in the beginning of the year, and I'm pretty sure I wasn't exposed to HIV. I'm not sure if maybe I just need to let nature take its course and let the natural flora come back or what? I've also been taking AZO Yeast pills, Fem Dophilus by Jarrow pills, cutting out sugar, carbs and starch, apple cider vinegar baths, I'm almost wanting to try the apple cider vinegar ******. NOTHING is helping and it's soooooooooooo uncomfortable and driving me crazy. My next appt is in March...but I was always hoping all this would cease by then. Thanks.",
