            "answer": "Hello,It is true that these skin crawling like features also called parasthesia are due to stress and anxiety.Take some antianxiety medicines whenever stressed and see if the symptoms persist.However other possibilities also cannot be ruled out.These possibilities are abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid.If the symptoms are intens,then a neurological disorder cannot be ignored. You can take multivitamins for some time. Also get your blood sugar tested.If the symptoms persist,then pls get yourself examined by a neurologist. After confirmatory diagnosis only, treatment can be started.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional queries.",
