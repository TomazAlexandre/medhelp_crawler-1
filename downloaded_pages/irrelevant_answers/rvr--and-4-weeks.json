            "answer": "You can predict response to interferon after forty-eight hours,however this is not the same as RVR.RVR trumps all other factors as viral suppression at four weeks means that the virus has not had time to mutate successfully before it is effectively anihalated.",

            "answer": "There have been smaller studies using 24 hours and 48 hours but the data is not quite as mature as the week 4 data. Personally, I was tested weekly until UND and while the earlier data may not have been mature it does offer a more cutting edge medical team some opportunities to tweak things. If I had to treat all over again, I'd probably do the 24 and 48 hour tests as well, insurance permitting. Not only would it feed my obsession and curiosity, but in the event of relapse this info might be very important as future studies may give us a more mature take at what that data actually means.Are you putting together a treatment plan? Forgot your stats but consider pre-dosing ribavirin and Alinia and getting down to your ideal BMI as well as testing for Insulin Resistance (IR).",

            "answer": "Don't have the time frame handy but if you post a new thread with \"Alinia\" in the heading, I'm sure you will get lots of responses as many here have incorporated Alinia into their treatment. Pre-dosing ribavirin is not very well studied but if I had to do it, I'd probably start the riba 2-4 weeks prior to my first peg injection and have some Procrit (epo) on hand if possible. Will this be your first treatment or do you already know how your hemoglobin will react to the riba? Personally, I'd do the biopsy as blood numbers aren't that accurate unless perhaps a very good hepatoloigst convinced me that I didn't need it based on his clinical assessment, which leads to the next question -- will you be treating with a hepatologist? Very important as gastro's really don't know their stuff and would also be less apt to let you tweak things off SOC. In fact, a study showed better results with hepatologists versus gastros and that is not surprising. There have been a number of recent studies suggesting a negative relationship between IR and SVR, but not sure how that works with diabetes. Again, you might want to post to that and also check out some of the material in \"CoWriters\" journal.",

My way of thinking it would be over kill with a biopsy.\u00a0\u00a0I understand blood work is not as accurate but on the far end of the numbers they are pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0With me its ast 125 alt 203\u00a0\u00a0platelets 121 even the protein numbers are a little elevated.
