            "answer": "The irregular periods are likely related to the weight gain. You should see your MD regarding the underarm lumps - I cannot tell what they are all about in print. An MD needs to see you. I would recommend seeing a reproductive endocrinologist/infertility subspecialist. They can evaluate for the irregular periods, and do your breast/axillary exam. The best solution for losing weight is a combination of caloric restriction and exercise. Losing weight is challenging but with weight loss your periods have a good shot at coming back to normal. Also, there are fertility pills and a diabetes medicine called glucophage which often help to start more regular ovulation. Good luck!",
