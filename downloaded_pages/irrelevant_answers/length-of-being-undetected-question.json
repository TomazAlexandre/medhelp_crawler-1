            "answer": "does anyone here know how long people who have done this treatment remain cleared of the virus for?YOU NEED TO BE UNDETECTABLE FOR 12 WEEKS TO BE CONSIDERED CURED.Is it a cure or will it come back?IT CURES MOST PEOPLE'S HCV BUT NOT ALL.Or do they not know for certain yet?YESEveryone who \"fails treatment\" relapses. Meaning the virus comes back (return of viral load) AFTER stopping treatment.All people on this treatment become undetectable and remain so as long as they are treating.FYI: When someone becomes undetectable (week 4 for example) does not determine how likely they are to be cured.Since the virus is always remains undetectable during treatment, it is AFTER treatment that determines if one is cured or not. A person must remain undetectable through the 12 weeks after stopping treatment to be \"cured\" of hepatitis C. SVR12.Best of luck staying undetectable and curing the virus!Hector",

    "question": "New here, just finished up Solvadi/Oylysio and was undected at 4weeks. Much easier treatment than the old treatments of Interferon and Rib. Interferon caused my sugar levels to rise which haven't gone down yet two years later (I read now Peg Interferon discloses it may cause diabetes) and Rib caused such bad muscle aches along with being a blood stealer.This new treatment was nothing compared to the past ones.My questions is, does anyone here know how long people who have done this treatment remain cleared of the virus for?Is it a cure or will it come back? Or do they not know for certain yet?Thanks in advance and I wish everyone the best and easier treatments.",
