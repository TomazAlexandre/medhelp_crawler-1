            "answer": "I have type 1 diabetes and I'm currently 34 weeks and measuring 38. 2 weeks ago, my son already weighed 6 lbs,4 oz. My ob said I have an excessive amount of amniotic fluid as well and due to my son's big size, they'll schedule me at 37 weeks to be induced at 38. They said that depending on his size at that time, I may need to have a c-section. I go to the doctor's every Monday and Friday for a Non-stress test to monitor his heart rate and my contractions. Don't be surprised if you start having contractions; I've been having them(the real thing-not braxton hicks) for the past 4 weeks as a result of his size. Make up a birthing plan and ask lots of questions, so that you're prepared when the day comes. It'll be ok! We're women and we grow humans! Lol! I'll keep you in my prayers. :-)",
