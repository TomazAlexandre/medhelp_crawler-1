            "answer": "Hi,You should be able to get the balanitis treated without reorting to circumcision.Circumcision is just an easy way out for health care providers.Having grown up in the Netherlands circumcision was rare. I had one class mate with diabetes and he was not circumcised at that time.Circumcision seems very extreme.",

            "answer": "Hello,For balanitis, Oral course of antibiotics is needed. In addition, please don\u2019t use any cosmetics on the penis, instead use some topical antimicrobials like Bacitracin or Lotrimin. Also corticosteroids and topical immunosuppressants can be used but they are available under prescription. Also retract the foreskin daily and soak in warm water to clean penis and foreskin.In case the symptoms persist then please consult a urologist/dermatologist for evaluation and antimicrobials and steroids prescription.Since you are a diabetic, so you may need the treatment for a longer time. I sincerely hope this helps. Take care.",
