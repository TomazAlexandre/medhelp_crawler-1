            "answer": "Unfortunately if an EKG is done when the heart is beating normally, the EKG will not tell the doctor anything about an heart rhythm problem... that's why many of us have worn heart monitors.\u00a0\u00a0These usually can record the events that we feel form time-to-time.\u00a0\u00a0Once recorded a doctor can give a diagnosis and recommend action.\u00a0\u00a0The good news is that many of us have heart rhythm problems and live with them, because the problem is not life threatening, or so we are told.",

            "answer": "Will try to keep this not too long. I am 72 yrs. female, with a number of conditions over many years, including\u00a0\u00a0, early-on Hypothyroidism, complete Hysterectomy,. Later, Fibro,( tho did not meet the 11 sensetive points required ), IBS, Diabetes T-2, Osteoporosis ( diffuse/scattered ), MVP/MVR, . The FM seemed to follow a bout with what appeard to be Flu or CFS or Lime, possibly undiagnosed Diabetes. I was vy tired and had to sleep a lot, stinging/shooting pains in various areas -- not all at the same time. Then came the diagnosis of\u00a0\u00a0Fibro at about age 60., followed by IBS. If you do a\u00a0\u00a0LOT of searching thru the info on FM , you will be suprised to find a number of conditions associated with Fibro such as the IBS, Hypothyroidism, sensetivity to cold & heat, Restless leg syndrome.This info is not necessarily\u00a0\u00a0included in the basic symptoms that you may read at first and i do not know if all Drs. agree with this. It has even been associated with Bladder Pain ( which I have also ). Fibro is also considered an immune system disorder related to but not Arthritis.Have you been tested for some of the things I've mentioned?I have pain in\u00a0\u00a0my spine and behind the heart area and sometimes in the front but again it is not severe..... agrevating enough to interfere with sleep but not severe. If you have spinal problems that can result in nerve pain\u00a0\u00a0that radiates to various areas,If I were you , I would look at some of the conditions that may be included under the \" Umbrella \" of Fibro but are less known and also have a good all-inclusive blood work done to rule out Diabetes. I have always wondered if all of the things i have might be a result of Endocrine System being just enough \" off \" to result in these-- sort of interrelated. I've not seen a Rheumatologist but understand some Drs. refer their patients to them.There are so many posibilities\u00a0\u00a0that it can be.Hope you find a DR. who will listen ---its too easy to prescribe one or more of these new meds that end up down the road having side effects as bad or worse than your current problems.pjj",
