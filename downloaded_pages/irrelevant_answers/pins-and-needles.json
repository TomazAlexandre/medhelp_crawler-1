            "answer": "Hi there.From the way you described the symptoms, I believe that the sensations are neuropathic in nature, meaning that there can be problems in the nerves supplying those areas.\u00a0\u00a0Common causes for these would include deficiencies in micronutrients such as the B vitamins and calcium, as well as stress and lack of sleep.\u00a0\u00a0People with metabolic disorders such as diabetes can also present with these problems.\u00a0\u00a0High sugar levels may eventually cause some nerve injury leading to these symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I suggest you inform your doctor about these and possibly discuss the conditions I mentioned.Regards and God bless.",
