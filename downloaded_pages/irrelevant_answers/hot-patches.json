            "answer": "HiThanks for writing in.Patches of hot sensation on leg, face or other parts might be indicative of sensory neuropathy, multiple sclerosis, peripheral neuropathies, nerve entrapment, diabetes, vitamin B12 deficiency and several other causes. Do you have any other associated symptoms like visual disturbances, balance problem or others? You should consult a neurologist for a complete examination. An MRI may be required to diagnose the condition.Do write in if you need more information.Take care",
