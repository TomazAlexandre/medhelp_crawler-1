            "answer": "Its sorta hard to explain, so sites say it should be a fasting glucose test, when i asked two days b4 i had my test, they told me i did not have to fast, and i had a burger 3 hours b4 my test, my levels was 138.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of women do fail the first one and pass the second one.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you ask all the questions you need to no when you call the office or at your next appt.If im not mistaken the test measures the ability of how your body handles large amounts of sugar, non-diabetic your levels will get hi and your body will do what it is suppose to do to bring the levels back down to a normal level but quickly.\u00a0\u00a0When it takes your body longer to bring the levels down it could be a possible indicator of diabetes and your body may need some assistance to bring the levels down, like insulin or pills.Keep us informed on how things go",

I spoke with the dr and they have me going into the lab tomorrow morning at 8am they didn't say anything about changing my diet today, but I do have to fast starting at 8pm tonight. My mom is going to go with me and keep me company for the 3 hours. The dr said the results will be back the very next day so I should know by Thursday if I passed this one or not.",

For the 1st one I has a mango slice..:-) so the test was such.Cut on carbs it helps. this is what i do. espcially the plain flour, white flour..bread, white rice.",

I assume this means I have to do the 3 hour test at my next appointment on the 9th. The thing is... I read about glucose levels and gestational diabetes online tonight. I looked at the \"diet\" they put you on. I already eat healthy well balanced meals 3 times a day with 2 or 3 light snacks. I do splurge and have ice cream or gummie bears once a day, but not in excess. I'm just confused as to how I could have failed the test.",
