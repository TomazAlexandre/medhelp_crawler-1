            "answer": "Dear tc3, i'm no doctor but from my own experience a high blood sugar makes me more sleepy. But i don't remember my kids needing a full 11 or 12 hours sleep a day as they started to get a little older. But neither of them had diabetes, which i know would increase the worry, just because i know i worry more about myself with my own concerns of diabetes. But the amount of sleep needed varies from person to person and as long as he seems to be functioning alright on his current sleep cycle then don't worry about it. wishing you the best, bret",

            "answer": "Hi tc3!\u00a0\u00a0I am the mom of a 17 year old who was diagnosed at the age of 21 months, so I have been just where you are and thought I'd put my two cents in tonight!\u00a0\u00a0With both my kids (1 with IDDM & 1 without), there was a standard routine to our evenings and there were rarely any diversions from it (possibly holidays & other special events).\u00a0\u00a0Kids thrive on consistancy because they can depend on it!\u00a0\u00a0Our routine started with a bg test, insulin shot, snack while watching TV (we didn't avoid any particular food except high sugared ones), we read a book while lying in bed and then lights out.\u00a0\u00a0If they went to sleep or not was their choice, but they had to remain in bed and be quiet.\u00a0\u00a0They were asleep by 8-8:30 and slept until around 8 the next morning.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter had a nap of at least an hour right up until she went to kindergarten at age 4 so I wouldn't even mess with the nap right now, especially if he gets cranky without it.\u00a0\u00a0Is he pretty active during the day?\u00a0\u00a0It's really important that he gets used to physical activity being a normal part of his day early on in life so that when he gets older, the exercise can be helpful in keeping his bg's in good control.\u00a0\u00a0I really don't think that his diabetes is keeping him from going to bed earlier. I realize that I was truly blessed with good sleepers & maybe it's hereditary because just thinking back on their bedtime routine makes me relaxed & sleepy! Have a good nite!",

            "answer": "Thanks bret, Galzee:Yes, I guess we're just stuck with a really cute night-owl!\u00a0\u00a0Our bedtime routine is just about the same, so I know there's not much to do except enjoy the laughing and talking we hear while he's falling asleep!Bret, you say that high bg makes you sleepy.... I'd have thought the opposite, but since I'm not diabetic, I'll take your word for it.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe only if the high bg is in relation to high carb intake as opposed to low insulin/control, etc....?Anyway, thanks again,Tony",

            "answer": "Tony,The popular press talks about \"sugar highs\" and the hyperactivity that can result when kids ingest sugar.\u00a0\u00a0They're referring to non-diabetic kids.High blood sugars make us lethargic because the truth is, our muscles and cells are, literally, starving... while the sugar floats dangerously thru our bloodstream.\u00a0\u00a0The sugar is in our body, yes, but it's not where it's needed to fuel us.\u00a0\u00a0Instead it's wreaking havoc.Slightly elevated BG will not generally have this impact, but high BG definitely will, especially if accompanied by ketones -- another toxin.\u00a0\u00a0Munchkins' energy level as bedtime nears can also be \"learned\" as way to spend more time with mommy & daddy, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Keeping to your/his routine and enjoying his chirping as he quiets himself down -- alone in his comfy cozy bed -- sound like a recipe for bliss!",

    "question": "Hi,My son is 3 years old and seems to have trouble getting sleepy before 11pm or later.\u00a0\u00a0Admittedly, he still takes an afternoon nap, but it is rarely longer than 1 hour (if he doesn't have at least 30-45 minutes, he might fall asleep too early, and be very difficult the rest of the evening).\u00a0\u00a0But since his regular waking hour is no later than 8am, I'm concerned that he won't get 10-12 hours of full restful sleep.With IDDM, his nighttime routine includes a snack and insulin injection approximately 1-2 hours before bedtime.\u00a0\u00a0My wife and I wonder whether this has a big effect on his lack of sleepiness.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, the snack is low in refined carbs, but has appropriate complex carbs (crackers, popcorn, pretzels, breadsticks, etc.) and always includes (cold) milk.\u00a0\u00a0In general, is a high blood glucose level going to mean a more alertness and less sleepiness?If the \"late\" snack is possibly keeping him up more (as we guess), are there alternatives to promote sleep?\u00a0\u00a0Maybe warming the milk and....?Thanks,Tony",
