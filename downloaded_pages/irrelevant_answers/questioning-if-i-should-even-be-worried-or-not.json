            "answer": "Theblood sugar numbers you list are VERY normal, so if you are wondering about hypoglycemia or diabetes, i would not look in that direction for reasons for your weird symptoms. Your lowest number was still within the range of \"normal\" and your highest numbers were perfectly normal also. So it appears that you can cross diabetes and hypoglycemia off of your list of suspicions for now. Are your doctors looking at possible nerve problems caused by pinched nerves? one of my co-workers has had some troubles like this and ended up seeing a chiropracter in order to find relief from leg and foot numbness.",
