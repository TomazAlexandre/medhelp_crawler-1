            "answer": "Hello,I was just thinking if you have ruled out pregnancy(if you are a female) as the cause of the continuous nausea.However, if it\u2019s not the case, you should consult a gastroenterologist and may be you need an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy to find out if there\u2019s any pathology in the food pipe/stomach and an Ultrasound of the abdomen especially to rule out a disease of the gall bladder.As you suffering from some headache also,it\u2019s important to rule out a disease of the brain causing the nausea.The nausea and headache can also be related to the concussion that you have suffered.Did you get CT or MRI head after that concussion?If not I feel that you should consult a neurologist also.I hope that helps. Please do keep me posted.Kind regards.",

            "answer": "I have heard of people having problems after a concussion, so I definately would get yourself checked out, you could have damage to your head. I would also get your stomach checked, I have GERD (acid reflux disease) and it makes me feel constantly nauseaous and that 'hungry' feeling your tlking about, as well as my stomach aches pretty much 24/7, food usually hurts it more.\u00a0\u00a0Are you having any other symptoms or are you on any medications? have you tried researching about concussions and your symptoms, I suggest you educate yourself so you know what to expect later on, and be persistent even if the tests come up fine, if you dont feel fine, dont stop looking for answers. Take care and good luck",
