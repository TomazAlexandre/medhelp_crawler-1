            "answer": "My what to expect book says pregnancy can cause thyroid issues that require monitoring. Just like pregnancy can cause hypertension or diabetes it can also mess with your thyroid. They are probably ruling out a tumor on your thyroid that would be a reason for your high levels. Try not to worry til you know it could be not a big deal at all. Actually my friend had thyroid cancer while.pregnant and she had all healthy pregnancy and they removed the cancer and all is well.",
