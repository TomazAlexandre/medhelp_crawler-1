            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Localized muscle spasm and twitch can be due to muscle strain as seen in wrong posture while sitting. Maybe, you can change posture and see if it helps. Dehydration and electrolyte imbalance, muscle fatigue, pinched nerve due to wrong posture could also be the cause. If changing posture and drinking fluids does not help, then other causes will need to be looked into.I would then suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Hence if you take alcohol or coffee then cut this down. Sleep at regular hours and see if it helps. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral. Take care!",
