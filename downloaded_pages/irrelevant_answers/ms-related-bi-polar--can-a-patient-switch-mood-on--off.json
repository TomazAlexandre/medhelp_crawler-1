            "answer": "& she abuses him & will set off the alarm if he rings backSorry that should of read....talks backAlso more recently, because my Dad refuses to let her stop him from speaking to me when shes in 1 of her \"moods\" ......she is being very odd & is pratically accusing me of having an affair with him.......the night he was in hospital I rang to see what was happening, & make sure she was okay & that the complex staff knew she was on her own.......she rwas getting very nasty & quite weird, telling me how my Dad still fancies her, so I'm wasting my time............& refused to let me get off the phone.....despite my having difficulty talking due to having fell & cracked ribs, she sounds like something from the excorsist, saying Hahaha, your in pain, like I'm not, & I dare you to hang up on me",

            "answer": "MS-related dementia is pretty well known.\u00a0\u00a0There can be symptoms similar to those of bipolar disorder, but it's not exactly the same thing, since LOTS of mental and emotional problems may come with MS.There isn't much you can do to help directly, but if you wish to help, contact her doctor privately (as she is your mother you can do this) and tell him what is going on.\u00a0\u00a0There are some medications that can help.And if you wish to learn more about this, you can google \"MS dementia\" or a similar combination of words.\u00a0\u00a0You can also search the medhelp site using the terms MS or Multiple Sclerosis.",

            "answer": "Thank you for your reply, I have googled those before & I have just tried again after seeing your response, but so far not yet found anything that fits her behaviour patterns, though reading up on uk MS info it mentions 10% developing Bi Polar\u00a0\u00a0symptoms, & reading up on Bi Ploar 1, I could pretty much tick every box, hence why I'm here asking questions, as I just don't know if it can be switched on & off the way my Mum does...........for example, 3 times recently, she has either thrown herself on the floor, or insisted she cannot get into her specially built bed, lay there\u00a0\u00a0all day sobbing & had my Dad in peices & screaming & snarling at him like a wild animal, that its his fault HE has to lift her & he's not allowed to get any help....he's 75 & ill himself & shes nearly 25 stone.........after he rang me in peices & I rang my Aunt, it took me & my Aunt to persuade him to ring for medical help....they sent an ambulance............took her in to hospital to check her over & she was suddenly sweetness & light itself, they discharged her a few hours later saying she was fine.This sort of thing is now a regular occurrence, but the controlling behaviour has been there for many years, as have the bouts of not sleeping & rambling speech, & though she will play on cognitive impairment, poor memory etc, in reality she is still very able & has an amazing memory.I do want to contact their Doctors. but not easy as I don't actually know who there Doctors are, my Dad daren't tell me, & my Mum tells hospital staff not to speak to me, after they once confirmed she was lying to me me about another stroke, since then I've been blocked out of any medical info, which as they still see her as rational, she is allowed to do (UK)thanks again, I will try the MS site",

    "question": "Hi,I',m hoping to find answers to what is rapidly becoming a very worrying & upsetting situation.I don't live close by, moved away from home when I was young, so for some reasons seems I get the brunt of the mood swings & irrational behaviour.......... I'll try & add some examplesmy Mother amongst other DX (diabetes etc) has MS, & I have read that many sufferers develop a form of Bi Polar Disorder, which I believe MAY be the route cause of her extremely nasty & manipulative & often quite strange behaviour, I think this possibly needs raising with her Doctors, but my Dad refuses, as he refuses to believe its a mental health issue......& says it would kill her to think that anyway & he has to stand by her............but the stress her behaviour puts him under is a massive worry, as he has heart problems & diabetes himself...........this week he collapsed & ended up in hospital as a result of what the hospital said was stress induced blood sugar problems, he is in his mid 70s.They have recently moved to an \"extra care\" development, which has meant her moving away from my Brother, who she dotes on & still treats as child despite him being in his 40s, the house is in a more remote area, so she has lost a lot of her independence as cannot get to the shops on her own on her trike anymore..........this has all made her MUCH worse.My Brother insist she cannot be Bi Polar, as she can turn her moods on & off at will, he NEVER gets to see that side of her, at least not directed it at him.....though he thinks of her as manipulative & controlling, but goes along with it as he benefits financially as he's not good with managing his money...........he thinks BiPolar cannot be turned on & off in this way, or directed at 1 member of the family & not others & that I am making excuses for her.Where they lived before, she could shop for herself, & she had manic shopping episodes where she would buy anything just for the sake of it, often forcing gifts on people they didn't want, she would buy very childlike clothing for me, the sort of things she would like to wear herself, but not my taste at all.........she would buy food & have no room for it & just bin it, she was obsessed with TV shopping channels & online shopping.She stopped the whole family speaking to me during my wedding & the birth of my Daughter, due to lies & her saving a text\u00a0\u00a0I sent in retaliation after weeks of snarling verbal abuse, whilst pregnant & working abroad, she was ringing me in work meetings, because I was a \"*****\" as I was pregnant.....at 40!Things finally calmed down & she now dotes onmy Daughter, but I am nervous around her as she can change at the drop of a hat & I often have no idea why she is attacking me again, I have over the years had many a 2/3am phone call, where I've had to sit & talk her out of committing suicide, whilst she accuses my Dad of beating her (not true) from the other end of the country, yet my Dad & Brother where home.........this was often a monthly occurrence, when I asked why me, when I had to work......n her words \"get used to it, thats what Daughters are for\"Thankfully since the 2 years of been cut off from my family, I can now distance myself a bit emotionally from the situation, but she turns on my Dad so badly that she drives him from the house & has him driving miles in the middle of the night in a very distressed state, just to get away from it..........she kicks him out at 3 am, & rings the Police if he wont go, she also now has an alarm on her neck that summons medical help, & she abuses him & will set off the alarm if he rings backI've had her kick off with me, whilst waiting for my Dad to leave the house, I could sense it brewing, but she could hold onto her temper until he left for work & then let rip, her mouth is vile & so irrational, ...for example accusing me of being a prositute & that is how I made my money, not my then well paid proffessional job...also accused my of having cosmetic surgery because I was \"losing my looks\"\u00a0\u00a0& she was glad it had gone wrong....when I was recovering from a Sinus operation ............I ended up walking the streets with my then toddler in freezing weather, until my Dad came home again, as there was nowhere else to go as it was Xmas & no transport etcMy Dad is talking to me now, even when she won't, in the past he's been too scared for the effect it has on her health, as she gets herself so wound up & has put herself in hospital.........she has also lied about having a heart attack & stroke, & told her medical staff not to speak to me, I had to get mt brother to go up to the Hospital & find out the truth, later confirmed by my Dad & Aunt too....at the time I had my Daughter in hospital here, so as you can imagine I was in turmoilI could go on & on, but won't bore you, I',m just trying to give some idea of the sort of behaviour that she exhibits, in the hope of getting some answersDoes this sound like BiPolar??, & if so, from those of you that suffer this, CAN you have anger with 1 person, but not another, & so effectively switch your moods on & off???Thank you",
