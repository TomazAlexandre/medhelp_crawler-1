            "answer": "Don't worry too much. Many woman fail their one hour but pass their 4 hour. In my personal opinion they should just have women fast before the one hour bc that's what happened to me. Not thinking I ate something sugary right before. It happened to me my last pregnancy. And at the 3 hour I passed with flying colors",

    "question": "Failed my 1 hour glucose test, hoping I passed the 3 hour one, will find out on Friday. If I failed it, they are most likely putting me as high risk... And I'm kinda worried they are going to make me have my little guy early if they put me as high risk cause I heard from one of the ladies at work that the docs are making her niece have her baby a month early because of gestational diabetes. I know what the docs tell me to do is going to be what's best for me and my baby, but I'm still kinda scared. I just want everything to be Ok and have my little boy come when he's supposed to, not at the end of this month, because my hubby and I aren't ready for him to come yet.",
