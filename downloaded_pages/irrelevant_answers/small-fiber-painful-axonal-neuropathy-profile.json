    "question": "My neurologist has ordered the following test: Small Fiber Painful Axonal Neuropathy Profile.\u00a0\u00a0My questions follow:1. Is Athena Diagnostics (Worcester, MA) the ONLY diagnostic lab that can perform this test?2. If Athena is NOT the only lab that can perform this test, who else can do it? (I live in Charleston, SC)3. May I use my insurance's blood lab (Quest Diagnostics) to have the blood drawn and forwarded to a \"certified\" diagnostic lab for this Profile?4. Can you provide an estimate for the cost of this Profile? (I have insurance, but nobody can tell me my out-of-pocket expenses for this Profile prior to having it done).COMMENT: I have negative EMG, negative Nerve Conduction Study, negative diabetes. Pain/parathesia on my feet has progressed from a nuisance to absolutely unbearable in three years. Now, I have the symptoms developing on tips of my fingers.THANKS!",
