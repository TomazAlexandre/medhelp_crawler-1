            "answer": "Measurements taken by echocardiography may vary according to the clinician, the methods of measurement and the echo machine itself.However, the difference in your readings is too big to be considered as a normal variation, especially that these readings were taken in relatively short periods.You didn\u2019t mention if you complain from any chronic illness (hypertension, diabetes, valve diseases, etc..) or whether you have changed your lifestyle or taking any treatment. These are all factors that would affect directly or indirectly the heart function, and suggesting possibilities would be to jump into conclusions without clear basis.I hope you would tell us more about your general condition. Keep in touch.",

            "answer": "An EF is not a static condition, and there can be variations as with blood prssure and heartbeat.\u00a0\u00a0These conditions are variable to maintain a balance of blood flow between the left and right side of the heart.To increase the EF, the left ventricle dilates within a normal range it is compensating, and a concentric increase (dilaltion) in chamber size increases contractility.\u00a0\u00a0The phenomonon is due to the Frand/Starling law of physics.\u00a0\u00a0An anology can be to stretch a handspring enables it to snap back with more force, but to over stretch the hand spring it will become flaccid...If chamber size (dilation) is abnormal, there can/will be a severe drop in EF as the heart will lose its contractility and the reduced blood flow can cause heart failure.When the EF is greater than 75%, it is likely the system is overcompensating.\u00a0\u00a0The first calculation is somewhat high, but within the compensating range.\u00a0\u00a0Considering the margin of error of the estimate for an EF is about 10%, the 74% may be overcompensating or within range, and the same for the 50% EF.When the workload of the heart is increased, the heart size will increase, and if the heart is overworked and stressed there can be a serious drop in the EF.\u00a0\u00a0The workload can be increased due to the high resistance of constricted vessels, high blood volume, reduced cardiac output, etc.",
