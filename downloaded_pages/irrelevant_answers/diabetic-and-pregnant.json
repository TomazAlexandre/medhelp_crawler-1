            "answer": "Hi there!It is not that all babies of diabetic mothers with higher blood sugars develop abnormally, though the chance is higher with uncontrolled sugar levels. The discomfort is unlikely to be related to diabetes and more likely to be due to laxity of the ligaments during pregnancy. However in spite of the comments, it is important to maintain sugar levels via limited carbohydrate intake, increased insulin levels and exercise, to reduce complications. I would suggest discussing the situation in detail with your treating doctor for appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you very much. I had my son and he was born at 38 weeks. My sugars were a little higher towards the end and he was unable to maintain normal sugars and was put into the NICU. While he stayed there for 10 days he had Jaundice, Cooms, and also had some respiratory issues that were later determined to be because of delivering via c-section at 38 weeks. Even though it was considered full term they explained that children born to diabetic mothers develop in utero slower in regards to organ/body size ratio.. I guess meaning the organs develop slower then the body fat and size so he was 38 weeks but his lungs were 36 weeks mature?? I understand but it is hard for me to re-explain lol but I am sure you know.. He is doing very well now and everything is good, but the end of my pregnancy was very stressful and painful and I was lucky to have a healthy boyafter birth.",

    "question": "I am type1 since the age of 7. I have one daughter that is 4 years old. When I had her my blood sugars were in good control and i ended up having her with a weight of 8 lbs 5 ounces. I am now pregnant again 4 years later with a son, I am 36 weeks pregnant, and my body is going through extreme painful episodes daily. I am not sure if it just because my body cant handle all the stress. I have gained a total of 50 lbs, 20 just in the last month, and my sugars are higher then a kite (around 200 to 300 on a bad day). When I seen my high risk dr he aid my A1C was 5.9 and that the baby was developing perfectly. His weight and activity in utero is perfect. I don't get it!!!! I am so confused, how is it that my body is completely feeling destroyed on the outside yet my son is thriving on the inside. I have taken chronic pain medication from my last pregnancy where I developed carpal tunnel in both arms radiating up to my neck and shoulders. Now it is in my back as well as my upper body.. I am so concerned. I hope everything is alright with me, and this could possibly be my last child which is depressing to me, I wanted to have one more child. I think that it might not be possible because of the years of lack of control of BS may have caused all this pain and my body to be really unable to create life anymore.... Is it the chronic pain that is causing me this pain? Or is it the diabetes? Or both... I appreciate any posts thanks.",
