            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!If you are a lady in menopausal age group, then it could be due to hormone imbalance. You would need to consult your gynecologist regarding this.Alcohol, certain drugs, allergy to food additives, heat intolerance, hot beverages and food, anxiety, orthostatic hypotension, certain endocrine disorders like those involving the adrenals, diabetes etc all cause facial flushing.Hope this helps. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
