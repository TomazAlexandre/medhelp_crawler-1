            "answer": "It's a common misconception that 37 weeks is full term. It's actually early term (I.e. baby can survive on their own outside the womb without assistance) but 40 weeks is full term. Babies born before 40 weeks usually don't have a fully developed sucking reflex (which messes with breastfeeding) and miss out on the last crucial weeks of development in the womb.",

            "answer": "I had GD with my first pregnancy and was induced at 39wks. I had a 7lb 14oz baby but by u/s they picked up he was nearly 10lbs i almost always had good sugar levels (controlled by insulin and tablets) they dont really let mothers with diabetes go over as it can be dangerous (break down of placenta, baby getting to large, problems with baby) thats why they induce to insure the situation can be controlled. When my boy was born he had beardy cardio (heartrate desending during labor and no heart rate when born.) And needed his sugar level checked every hr as babies born from diabetic mothers cant control their own sugar levels but u should already know this as it would have been explained. So induction is the safest option cause u dont know whats going to happen during labor and before u even get to hospital. Congrats and goodluck i wish u a healthy and safe delivery =)",
