            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your medical problems. If EMG and NCV was normal then nerve compression, muscle disease and peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes, hypothyroidism, Lyme\u2019s or lupus are more or less ruled out.Other possibilities are fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, electrolyte disturbance, and multiple sclerosis ALS is more or less ruled out as you have normal EMG/NCV.If the above mentioned problems are ruled out, then it may help to re-do the EMG/NCV. Meanwhile start physiotherapy and see if it helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "I have had an NCV / EMG by my current Neuro Dr. and the NCV (while there were some issues) were \"within acceptable\" limits. I have had muscle twitching for about 3 months now and both my legs hurt when I stand for a short period of time or if I walk around the block, I need to sit. I also seem to have a slight atrophy in my let hand.I have not lost strength in my arms or legs. But, the pain is horrible. My EMGs came back clean. I have had all blood work done and everything is normal. I have had an MRI of both my lumbar and Cervical. The lumbar MRI came back with 2 impressions which describe bilateral displacement of the L3 / L4 Nerve roots. But, the EMG did not pick up any impingement on these nerves. I also have pain in both my arms. could the EMG have NOT picked up the nerve impingement (or) could this mean that the EMG is invalid? The DR. performed the EMG himself, which is probably a good thing... Could these be symptoms of ALS?",
