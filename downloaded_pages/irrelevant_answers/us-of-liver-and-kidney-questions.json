            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding alcohol and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels.The thinning of the cortex or parenchymal loss of the kidney could be due to causes like prior infections.Ultrasound only assess the structural abnormalities, to assess the functional status you could have a liver and kidney function tests done.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
