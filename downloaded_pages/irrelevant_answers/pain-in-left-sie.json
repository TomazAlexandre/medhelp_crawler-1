            "answer": "Hello,Various possibilities are there.It can be a muscle strain or ligament sprain.Apply warm ompresses on the area and take some over the counter anti-inflammatory pain reliever like ibuprofen or diclofenac.Application of anti-inflammatory gel or cream will also help.Other causes for such symptoms are overweight,prolonged standing during the day,dehydration, alterations in the balance of salts in the bloodstream (such as a high or low sodium,calcium or potassium level),neuropathy(esp in diabetes),hypothyroidism,peripheral vascular disease(narrowing of the leg arteries which causes poor circulation),sarcoidosis,excess alcohol,nerve compression, and sometimes liver disease.Some of these causes like dehydration, being overweight, alcohol intake and prolonged standing are modifiable by efforts of the patient.My advice is to consult a physician and rule out the above medical conditions by thorough investigations as without physical examination and investigations, pinpointing a diagnosis is tough.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts.Kind regards.",

    "question": "Several months ago I started experiencing pain in my left side especially in the morning. The pain seems to spasm almost like a charlie horse and puts me down. When first getting out of bed, I cannot bend over to put my socks on. I have no problem the rest of the day and walk 4 miles a day but know if I move wrong, I will have pain but not spasms. I had been working in the yard earlier in the season and lifting 100-# flagstone and wondered if I may have pulled a muscle. I am unsure if muscles spasm if injured. I put off making an appointment with the doctor due to insurance but have made an appointment this Friday. Any suggestions. Thanks",
