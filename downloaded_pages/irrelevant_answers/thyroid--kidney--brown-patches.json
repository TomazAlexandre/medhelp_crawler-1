            "answer": "I hope you mean 8,000 IU vitamin D and not 80,000. You can take too much Vitamin D. Have it tested when you have your next blood test. Kidney stones could mean too much calcium, and the Vitamin D could make this condition worse. Too much Vitamin D can also cause other kidney problems. Consult with your doctor and have him/her do a full blood panel.",

            "answer": "Some kidney diseases cause skin hyperpigmentation (dark patches) so I think you definitely need to see a specialist about this. I reckon that is the most likely explanation.Another possibility is Addisons disease. Apart from the skin thing, you get extremely tired and generally have symptoms similar to low thyroid. I would recommend that you ask to get your cortisol level measured to check this - if it is low, your doctor should order follow up tests.But I think the kideny problems sounds more likely. If you type \"skin discoloration kidney disease\" into Google you'll find a lot of info.",
