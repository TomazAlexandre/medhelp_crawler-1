They said the risk for preterm labor is higher with twins but there isn't anything I can do to prevent that besides the normal pregnancy dos and donts.\u00a0\u00a0After 20 weeks I will have to go in every 4 weeks for an ultrasound to check their growth,\u00a0\u00a0position,\u00a0\u00a0cervix, etc. And the risk of gestational diabetes and hypertension is higher in pregnant gals but other than that I haven't been doing anything different this pregnancy than I did with first baby.",
