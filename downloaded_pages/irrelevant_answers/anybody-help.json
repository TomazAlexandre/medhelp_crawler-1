            "answer": "Hi,How are you? I'm sorry to hear what you have been through for the last 3 years. It is good that the tests done were fine. Aside from the steroids, what other medications are you taking? If the cause is not yet known, further evaluation may be done such as electrolyte level, thyroid function tests, CT scan, electromyography and nerve conduction studies . Hang on and hope to hear from you soon. Take care always.",

            "answer": "Hi, i already had a ct scan and all clear i shall check with my gp about the other tests.My other meds are gaminil for the depression, imigran which is a migraine tablet and i was on neuronten for neuropathic pain but my gp says it would be that which is causing my leg to jerk up and down so he changed it to tegretol retard.Last thursday i started on the steroids again by infusion but so far apart from my migraines easing a little they dont seem to have done anything for me apart from make me hot in the head and neck and have an upset stomach! life goes on though waiting for an appointment for the rhuematologist at the minute thanks for your concern.",

            "answer": "Hi,How are you? If you are not improving with the steroid and you are uncomfortable with the side effect, inform your doctor about this. A change of medication or adjustment of dosage may be done. However, it is not recommended to abruptly stop steroids abruptly since this medication should be tapered before discontinuing. Take care and regards.",
