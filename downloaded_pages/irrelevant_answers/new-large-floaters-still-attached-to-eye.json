            "answer": "if your floater has occurred SINCE your visit to the retinal specialist, then you need to go BACK asap.but if you are still talking about the floater/flash that was caused by blood in your vitreous/retina already noted by the specialist, then thats really no big deal.\u00a0\u00a0as long as you dont have a detachment (which the retinal specialist would have told you about, so the fact that he/she did not mention that to you means you DO NOT have it...it does not mean that he/she \"missed\" it)...anyway as long as your retina is attached, blood and floaters will eventually disappear.\u00a0\u00a0it may take MONTHS, however.\u00a0\u00a0do not be looking for this to resolve quickly.the bigger problem in my mind is *why* did your retina bleed out?\u00a0\u00a0usually its some underlying systemic problem that needs to be addressed like DIABETES.",

            "answer": "I went to another doc this morning for another opinion and look...it sppears that it is an incomplete PVD, and that some of the floater is stuck on a little capillary which bled a bit.I guess the big thing is that I have to wait it out to see if it will finally detach, move out of my field of vision, or hang indefinately.Yes, I am on \"retinal tear watch\" as is customary during times like this. I will be going back in next week, and also was told not to take aspirin, hang upside down and to watch for flashes, a dark curtain, etc.",

    "question": "I have already had floaters in both eyes, but last Sunday I wole up with a load of new ones in my right eye. I visited a retinologist who says my retina is fine, however, it appears that the floater seems to be still stuck to the eye..I see it at the top of my eye, hanging down like a bubbled curtain that flicks around as I look. Technically this is actually on the bottom of my eye, as our eyes turn things upside down.I am *extremely* distressed by this, as it is hanging in my visual field. The retinologist said there was some blood in these floaters as well and that that will be reabosrbed. I am not sure what part is the blood, and what isnt. I do see the usual fibers and collegen bits floating around too.The most distressing part is this hanging floater. I have fallen into a deep depression over this. What are the odds this will detach at some point? This on top of all the new junk in my eye has completely plummeted me into a pit of despair.Thanks",
