            "answer": "Thank you missie. It helps just getting any info I can lol. I think everything will turn out ok. This is my 4th baby and I have never had gestational diabetes before so the Dr said it will probably turn out ok this next test. If the thyroid comes back \"off\" I guess he will explain more then! Thanks!",

I had to have a c section after a failed induction but never had labour pains which was a bonus. Good luck at least if you have gd it can be controlled through diet or insulin and usually disapears after the birth.",

    "question": "Hell ladies. Hope everyone is doing ok. I am currently 26 weeks pregnant. Today I had my glucose screening and it came back 3 points above where it should be. So now I get to go for the 3 hours test, fun fun! Has anyone had their test be a little high and turn out not to be gestational diabetes? And if I do have it what will I have to do during pregnancy, anything different?Another question is, I have PVC's which are worse during pregancy, that's not what I'm writting about though. Also I have been having many many contractions! 13 last night in an hour. I have been through labor before though and knew they weren't \"real\" labor pains. My Dr. mentioned my thyroid may be \"off\" being when it's off it can ause PVC's and alos alot of contractions in pregnancy. I can't find ANYTHING on thyroid and pregnancy that really explains enough. All I have read is that it can and has caused early miscarriages. Has anyone experinced thyroid problems in pregnancy as well....if so what were your symptoms and how did they treat it and do you know if I'm at risk for pre-term labor, being I'm having these contractions?Any help would be appreciated ladies.
