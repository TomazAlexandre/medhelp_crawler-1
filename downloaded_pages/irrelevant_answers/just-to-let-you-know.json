    "question": "Hello it is me again well went to see the doctor yesterday and sadly to say I gained 2 1/2 pounds in a week and my gluclose levels have been quite high all week and doctor decided to put me on insulin. So now I am injecting 20 units 2 a day for the diabetes. And she has decided that she is going to induce me on 5-1-06 instead of my due date of 5-15-06. And well I guess my next questions is what are my chances of getting rid of the diabetes after I have my baby? I had gestational diabetes with my 4th pregnancy but I was able to control it with just the diet and did not need insulin injections and I got rid of it after I had my daughter. Well sorry to take more of your time. I will be waiting for your answers thank you very much.",
