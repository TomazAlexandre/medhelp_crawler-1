            "answer": "Hi,Looking at you blood results, they dont look to bad...but after saying this you are having the symtoms of ketones, which happens when your bloods are running high, however they normally say to produce ketones your sugars are normally running higher than 13.0 but this may be different if your onset of diabetes is fairly new and you are taking no medication to reduce your blood sugar levels. I know in southern Indai origion Type 2 diabetes is high. So please go back to your doctor and tell him/her that you want your ketones testing and a HBA1C taking. Hopefuly this will help.Take care & God bless",
