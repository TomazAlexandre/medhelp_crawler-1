She may need a new MRI to determine if any new lesions have appeared.\u00a0\u00a0There are very specific clinical signs and symptoms that correlate with withdrawal. Siezures are one of them, elevated blood pressure, sweating, tremors (aka DT's)Never heard of cholesterol causing siezures unless a patient has a stroke or heart attack secondary to the complications of having high cholestorol. That answer provided sounds weird. I think it is a good idea that you are getting a second opinion.",

            "answer": "\"And Yet Another Brain Threat: Statin DrugsStatin-Drugs- These widely-used cholesterol drugs can cause memory loss\u2014there are even new warning labels about this and diabetes risk.Statin drugs are huge money-makers for the drug companies. They\u2019re touted as being able to lower cholesterol and thus reduce the risk of heart attack and heart disease. They also weaken the immune system and make it difficult to fight off bacterial infections; increase the production of cytokines, which trigger and sustain inflammation; deplete the essential nutrient Co-Q10; and have documented side effects. These include nerve damage, neurological problems (including Lou Gehrig\u2019s Disease), muscle damage (don\u2019t forget that the heart itself is a muscle), liver enzyme derangement, and in some cases even kidney failure, not to mention tendon problems, anemia, acidosis, cataracts, and sexual dysfunction.Moreover, as we reported in January, statin drugs increase one\u2019s risk of developing diabetes. A 2010 meta-analysis found that statin therapy of any dosage was associated with 9% greater diabetes risk.The FDA should pull all statins. But at least there are some new label warnings, however mild. Now the consumer may read about the risk of memory loss and confusion. But the FDA adds: \u201cThese reports generally have not been serious and the patients\u2019 symptoms were reversed by stopping the statin. However, patients should still alert their health care professional if these symptoms occur.\u201dNew labels also include a warning that increased blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia) and an increased risk of being diagnosed with type 2 diabetes have been reported with statin use. We wonder how long it will take for FDA to add warnings, however mild, about bacterial infections, neurological problems, muscle damage, anemia, and sexual dysfunction. (\u201cNever mind the sexual dysfunction,\u201d the drug manufacturers will say. \u201cWe have a pill for that!\u201d)\"",

            "answer": "Hi KT- While it's never out of the question entirely, I've never heard of MS causing the types of seizures your mother is experiencing. I don't think it's the disk issue either. And her disk issue most certainly did not cause her MS. If you have doctors telling you this you need to find new doctors!The drug combo she is taking is not out of the ordinary for neuropathic pain. While I do not take methadone, I do take a combination of an antidepressant (Elavil) and an anticonvulsant (Lyrica) for my neuropathic foot pain. Dilantin is an anticonvulsant and Nortriptyline is an antidepressant. They are't sure why these combinations work, but they do.Let us know how things go on Monday :-)Kyle",

            "answer": "Hi,It is possible, albeit somewhat rare, to have seizures with MS but if as Pantx said, there is a lesion in the area of the brain responsible for her seizure type.The Dilantin may have been keeping the seizures in check.As one ages the body metabolizes drugs more slowly but it could just be that her seizure activity (if that is what it is) is becoming more active and the dose needs adjusting.Just my two cents worth. Wishing you luck with getting to the bottom of this and better health for your Mom!Rendean",

            "answer": "So we changed primary care doctors and saw a neurologist. Both are amazing. My mom actually started having an episode during her doctors appointment, so the doctor thought it could be anxiety related as well. The doctor prescribed Xanax and that seems to be working, or at least she says she is less dizzy and feels better. We saw a neurologist yesterday and after a long visit, he does not think the episodes were MS related or stroke related. He thinks it was caused by all of her medication, and wants to take another look at the medicine cocktail she has been taking for 20 years. Her kidneys also showed signs of disease, but he did not seem that worried. He ordered an EEG and a MRI to rule out strokes and seizures and then he will go from there. I appreciate all the comments and suggestions. Thank you very much.",

    "question": "My mom is 66 and has had MS for 20 years. I apologize for not using the right terminology here, but her MS symptoms are focused in her feet and legs and are constant (she says it feels like her legs/feet are asleep, but it is painful). They think her MS was caused by a slipped disk destroying nerves around her spine. When first diagnosed she was entered into a UCSF pain management study and the pain killer cocktail that worked for her combined Methadone, Notriptyline, and Dilantin. After some warm water pool therapy she was able to walk again and has been doing well for the past 18 years.This past June, she started getting dizzy. Her doctor gave her some anti-dizzy medicine and said she probably had an inner-ear infection. It got worse of the course of a few days and one day she started violently shaking. She got herself to a chair and when we found her she could not move her arms or legs. Once in the hospital she had another episode as she was talking to a relative who documented the progression (slurred speech, shaking, then loss of control of limbs). The hospital noticed her Dilantin levels were low, and put her on an IV of Dilantin. The next day she seem fine. They discharged her. The hospital never really diagnosed her, but her general doctor said it was a stroke based on high cholesterol, even thought no stroke showed in the MRI. She was weak for about a week afterward, but pretty much fully recovered.This past week, she started feeling dizzy again. On Saturday morning she started feeling weird and started shaking, so we took her to the ER. She had another episode in the waiting room in the ER with the same exact same symptoms (slurred speech, shaking, then loss of control of limbs). Then she had two more episodes while in the ER. They took blood tests, and again she showed low levels of Dilantin. They did a CT scan and there were no signs of a stoke. They said she was having seizures based on her low Dilantin levels. The gave her two injections of Dilantin, she seemed fine and they sent her home.Now she seems fine again, although a little weak, dizzy, and tired, but pretty good for having three back to back episodes. We went to a follow up appointment with her general doctor on Monday. He again insisted it was related to her cholesterol. Although he had just sent her a letter a month prior saying how well she has done getting it down to a good level. He rejected the ER doctors diagnosis that it was seizures from Dilantin withdrawals. All he did was double her cholesterol medicine.So we are getting a second opinion on Monday, and seeing a neurologist. It seems pretty basic if it is a Dilantin withdrawal, and relatively easy to control, but we are confused why she has stopped metabolizing the Dilantin (and she insists she never misses taking a dose). We are starting to be more involved in her health now that she is widowed and living with my family, and we obviously do not want her to have any additional seizures/strokes. We were just curious if the seizures could be MS related, and maybe after 20 years she is presenting another symptom. There are too many unanswered questions, and every time I walk across the driveway to her house I worry that I am going to find her passed out on the floor. Any help or suggestions would be appreciated. Thank you.",
