    "question": "Over the last 6 + months I haven\u2019t been feeling right and haven\u2019t been feeling myself I am normally a very energetic person, very bubbly on the go, I want to do things and can\u2019t sit still but I think ever since I had my ankle operation and did my recovery and rehabilitation I haven\u2019t been myself. My friends who know me best have noticed and so has Luke and he knows me inside and out and has started saying he thinks something is wrong and he is confirming my concerns, he told me to write down a list of how I have been feeling so I have and here it is:I am constantly getting my allergic rash all over my body lately but I am very very careful with what I eat and I got another attack but didn\u2019t have anything that would set it off but then also I get cravings for foods I don\u2019t normally want, but then I get waves of nausea and diarrhoea and waves of not wanting to eat anything for days.I am so extremely fatigued, I\u2019m so tired and lethargic and it really isn\u2019t like me I am bubbly and energetic and full of life and I haven\u2019t felt like that in ages, I go to sleep but I never feel refreshed after waking up and I know something is wrong and its more than just sleep apnea and Luke and I are now worried.I am getting lots and lots of muscle pain and weakness all over my body in my legs in my hands in my feet. I am mentally, emotionally and physically tired and just exhausted of being like this and if you ask anyone I was a very energetic person I could walk around the city all day and still have energy to do it again. I have noticed a sore throat that keeps recurring and my eyes sometimes becoming blurry and then other times being dry and I can\u2019t stop rubbing them.I have gotten headaches and migraines increased in the last 6 months and they are more severe then I have ever had and a lot more frequent, which I think has affected my concentration level and memory skills I normally have an amazingly great memory and I am forgetting things I really shouldn\u2019t, like I know everyone\u2019s numbers in my family and I am forgetting them and other things that are little but I know it\u2019s not like me to forget things like that.I am having terrible trouble with my concentration and I can hardly focus at all, and that is something I have never had trouble with, I have been told I sometimes space out where as other times I just don\u2019t feel right. I have noticed that I am sometimes so quick and alert and other times I am useless and it\u2019s like I am not using my brain at all or it\u2019s on holidays.I have been having chest pains and shortness of breath and I use my puffer but it doesn\u2019t help at all and I am having more dizzy spells. And as you know I am depressed and my partner has noticed I have become more and more anxious and having panic attacks and very weird mood swings and my partner calms me down but I have detected he has been saying are you ok? And that he is worried about me? more often and it is increasing.",
