            "answer": "I am so sorry for your loss. I also have experienced miscarriage and it was the most devistating thing that I have ever experienced. Here is a recent study that I read that may help you to decide when to ttc again:New Pregnancy Studyby SunWorshiper_26, Oct 12, 2010 02:47PMResearch Briefs from The Parent ReviewNo wait needed for pregnancy after miscarriageFor the best pregnancy outcomes, when should a woman try to conceive again after a miscarriage? The sooner the better, a new study suggests. Scottish researchers looked at data for nearly 31,000 women who became pregnant after an initial miscarriage. Compared to women who conceived 6 to 12 months after their miscarriage, those who became pregnant again within 6 months were 34% less likely to miscarry a second time. They were also less likely to have an ectopic pregnancy, a cesarean or preterm delivery, or a low-birth-weight infant. The highest risks of a second miscarriage and other pregnancy complications were seen among women who conceived more than 24 months after miscarriage. The findings run contrary to current guidelines by the World Health Organization to wait at least half a year to conceive after having a miscarriage, which affects approximately one in five pregnancies.Source: British Medical Journal 341 (2010): c3967.",

            "answer": "First off, im sorry for your loss its a very hard thing to deal with. I personally think whenever your ready to start tryin again, go for it. A lot of women ( myself included) have miscarriages then end up pregnant again shortly after (especially if it was a natrual miscarriage) i recommend doing everything you can to get your body healthy then start trying like getting your diabetes under control ( which it sounds like your on the right track) and taking prenatals. Good luck and hope to hear back from you with news of a BFP;)",
