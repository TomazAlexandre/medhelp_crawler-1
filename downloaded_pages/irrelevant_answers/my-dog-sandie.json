    "question": "Hello I have a small dog he is over a year old and he doesnt eat that much only bits and pieces, I had him to the vet and he suggested giving him a small bowl of nuts and just give him that but that did not work and now he just eats small\u00a0\u00a0pieces of chicken nothing regular really. Is there any appetiser available for dogs. He also has a sore ear\u00a0\u00a0which\u00a0\u00a0is red on the inside and he yields to it when he scrathes it particularly at night. Is there any cure for this? thank you.",
