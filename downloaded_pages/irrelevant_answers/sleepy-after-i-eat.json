            "answer": "Thanks for using the forum.Your obviously know that a blood glucose of 228 30 minutes after eating is too high. If your sugar is spiking up that high you are running the risk of complications from your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone helped you to plan your diet to manage your diabetes. A dietician could help you to set up a meal plan, and to make dietary choices that will prevent your blood sugar form swinging between high and low.I hope this helps. Good luck.Cathy",
