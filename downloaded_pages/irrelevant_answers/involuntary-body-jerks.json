            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, involuntary jerky movements can be due to Celexa. Ask for a dose adjustment or switch to another drug and see. Do this under the supervision of a doctor.If this does not help, I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi!\u00a0\u00a0I am new to this web-sites so forgive my mistakes.\u00a0\u00a0I was just wondering if anyone out there experiences involuntary jerking movements in different parts of your body.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't necessarily call them \"tremors\" more like just an occational jerk here and there several times a day.\u00a0\u00a0I started taking celexa about 5 months ago for mild depression and more recently phentermine for weight loss but these jerking movements were happening way before the phentermine.\u00a0\u00a0Can't seem to relate anything else to it.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible the Celexa could cause that?\u00a0\u00a0Just curious if anyone else has had or ever had that before.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
