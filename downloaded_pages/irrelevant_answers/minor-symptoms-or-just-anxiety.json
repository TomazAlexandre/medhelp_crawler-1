            "answer": "Hi there, and welcome.At this point I wouldn't say your symptoms sound like MS. You may have had the first one, an odd sensation in your shoulder, and since then been 'on the lookout for' other odd sensations. It's not surprising that some appeared. The human mind works that way. We all have odds and ends of aches and pains here and there that we largely ignore, and they go away. but if we focus on this, we're much more aware of them and they become much more important. My own rule of thumb is that, \"Whatever this is, if it's significant enough I'll know in due course.\"\u00a0\u00a0Then I just forget about it, and 19 times out of 20 that was the right thing to do. Good odds and no worry.If you have risk factors for diabetes then you're very wise to check this out. It's much more common than MS. If it turns out you're fine and you still have symptoms, keep a record of when they came and went. Ultimately you may need to see a neurologist but it doesn't seem necessary now.Best of luck,ess",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for your response. I know I am not out of the woods yet but you really took a lot off of my mind. I tried to explain to my parents about this but they just shrugged it off so I really didn't know where to go to talk to about this. I will keep track of any future symptoms that may come and go and if need be find a good neurologist. Again, Thank you so much.",

            "answer": "Ok, so I've been to my doctor for blood work but still everything has come back normal. No diabetes (Thank God), and my thyroid is fine. I'm still under stress with school as I'm graduating in June and I have a huge project due within a couple of weeks. I've noticed my hands have a slight tremor, almost every morning I notice that my hands feel like they \"fell asleep\" only for a brief period of time and that feeling goes away, and recently I noticed that my whole body shakes when I'm laying in bed. It feels like it shakes with my heart beat. They aren't huge convulsions but it feels like someone is shaking my bed. I've laid down on other beds and the shaking is still there. I'm going to make a appointment with a neurologist fairly soon when I have the time. I haven't had any pain in my face or loss of feeling in any other part of my body. My parents think it's just stress but I'm still worried about it. Any input would be greatly appreciated.I hope all of you are doing well. God bless.",

    "question": "Hello,For the last 3 weeks I have had this tingling sensation in my right shoulder blade. No pain was involved just the tingling sensation. It finally went away this past week and it hasn't returned but now my back feels somewhat stiff. Still, it's not painful just an annoyance. Also, my hands feel weird. Not quite tingling but just odd. I don't know if it's anxiety or mild symptoms of MS but there is no actual pain or numbness. I've also had symptoms that included being tired all the time, extremely hungry most of the day, achy joints, and my hands falling asleep quite often. Diabetes runs in the family so I'm leaning towards that but I read the symptoms of MS and they both share some similarities.I took some blood work this past Friday as a precaution and I get my results this upcoming Friday. Any input would be greatly appreciated.",
