            "answer": "I asked my electrophysiologist many questions regarding Cryo vs. RF ablation.\u00a0\u00a0His response was there are times when cryo-ablation is used.\u00a0\u00a0But in most cases, RF is preferred by him because it \"burns deeper, and results in fewer return ablations later down the road.\"Another \"fancy\" tool you'll see referenced is \"magnetically steerable catheter\". Here a joystick is used to position the catheter for the burn.\u00a0\u00a0Again my EP said that for him, old fashioned feel beats the joystick any day.",

    "question": "Hi, I'm a 31 year old male that's been taking medication (Verapamil 180mg, Flecainide100mg) for atrial fibrillation for the past 3.5 years. The problem is made worse for I also have the following conditions,Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus (19 years)Addison's disease (18 years)Since starting the medication it's become difficult to continue any small activity for this sets off the AF with my heart beat reaching anywhere up to 220bpm, which almost certainly requires a trip to the hospital for this also effects my Addison's disease. I have received cardioversion on several occasions but I quickly relapse. I recently heard about this new procedure called cryosurgery, is this a procedure that most cardiologist's would recommend for patient's suffering from AF or does it also have it's own risks?If anyone has had this procedure done I would love to hear any feedback you may have.Many Thanks,Noddy323",
