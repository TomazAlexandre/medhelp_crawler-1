    "question": "I'm supposedly between 33-34 wks. preggo, I have gestational diabetes, the baby is completely breech (butt first, not feet), and I may very well have preeclampsia as well...and, I'm still at about 193 lbs., (down from between 204-206). I am very worried, especially about this preeclampsia thing, but I guess I probably won't find out for sure until my next appointment, which is on the 22nd. (Hopefully, I'll find out sooner)... has anyone else had these same troubles, or am I just not meant to have kids???? Some times I wonder if this isn't a sign from God that I shouldn't be having one in the first place or something... it's very frustrating and scary, all these problems.... :-S",
