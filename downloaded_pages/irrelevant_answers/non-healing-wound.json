            "answer": "I think you should make an apt with your gp. Wounds that don't heal can be very bad news and as you are living a healthy life style- there is no reason why it should be taking so long to heal. I mean smoking can delay wounds, but even if you were still smoking that's just too long.",

            "answer": "I'm just a lay person but what you were saying about blister round the edge sounds like what my daughter had when she was little and it turned out to be impetigo. Is it an open sore with blister round the edge? looks like a burn but doesn't hurt as much, gets bigger as time goes on? If so it could be that the impetigo infection got in the burn wound. Clears up very quickly with a strong antibiotic cream.",

            "answer": "Yeah with those extra symptoms definitely make sure you're not being ignored. I've never heard of the blood test mkh9 mentioned so you might have to fight for it. Also keep in mind that there have been some changes in definitions lately making previous borderline people actually considered diabetic. So if all you can get is a standard blood sugar test and yours is slightly off, I suggest asking for a more in depth study like an insulin resistant test or a 8 hour blood test. Best to know what your body is doing then leave it to \"meh it should be fine.\" I'm sure you're aware of just how dangerous uncontrolled diabetes can be-not worth the risk!",

I took a blood test this past Monday and called the Dr's office today, the nurse says everything came back fine, the letter is in the mail. I should see the #'s when I get it. I am taking probiotics. I do not like yogurt. The wound is still the same. I will finish the meds and call back and see what else I can do. I have a 3 small scratches that have been around on my wrist since last week and they are still red. Kind of concerned until this all goes away.",

            "answer": "It could indeed be a staph infection as they are commonly transmitted at gym's since everyone is touching the equipment and not washing their hands etc. Staph also does have pus and so does strep. Impetigo is usually a combination of Staphylococci and Streptococci. This antibiotic (Keflex or Cephalexin) should do the job although some staph strains can be resistant. I hope it works for you. In the meantime wash any clothing or towels and wash rags that may have come in contact with the would, including gym clothes and jackets etc. in hot soapy water and hot dryer.let us know how you do.mkh9",

She also added if there is no change to ....yeah, that's right...see the Dermo. I going on day 5 tomorrow......and guess what....no change. What is the matter?? I have an appointment with the Dermo tomorrow @ 3pm. Is there something I can suggest for testing? I have insurance and a secondary. My insurance will take 80% and the secondary will handle the 20%. The test I took last Monday was a BMT calcium test. I do not know why.\u00a0\u00a0Was this necessary? Is this a test for sugar?? Should I request a biopsy or something? Some one please.

By all means ask, but I don't know how much good this will do.I think you need to specifically ask for a fasting blood glucose test, an insulin resistant test, etc. and make sure they've ruled out diabetes.",

If I am correct, then my question to my Dr. is why?Well, seen the Dermo today @ 3 pm. with one more antibiotic (2nd type) to take tonight. She took a piece of my skin to biop. Also included was a filled prescription of Mupirocin, to rid of the impitego. I'm covering it with paper tape and gauze so it can breath better. She will call me when the results come back. Mean time I intend to make my trip and maake the best of it. Thank you so much for your support. Even with a dear sister in the medical field, I did not want to get her too concerned. Communicating with you made it much more easier to deal with this situation. I will keep in touch when I get the results.",

    "question": "Christmas eve 2011, I burned my outer left hand just under the tumb. Small burn, about 1/3 \" x 1/8\". I go to work the following Tuesday and apply some burn ointment to it and it flared up making it a larger area, about a nickle size. It is now about the size of a dollar coin. I saw a dermatologist 2 weeks ago, and she recommended vaseline. I have been applying it and it seemed fine for 2 days. After that it grew and bubbles and pusses. On the edges it seems blisted. I have not smoked for 2 months now and am not a drinker. I am highly active and go to the gym. I keep the wound clean and covered when I go to the Gym. I feel I am in fairly good shape and good health.\u00a0\u00a0Itake vitamins and eat lots. I am 54 years of age and am 5'7\" and 138 lbs, with low body fat. I have a full time job, care for my grandchildren and parent. I also volunteer\u00a0\u00a0with community church 3 times a week.Any suggestions to what can be going on and what to do. I am actually going to make an appointment with the Dermo again or should I call my Physician. I barely see my physician, because I hardly get ill. I do not know which Dr. to follow up with.",
