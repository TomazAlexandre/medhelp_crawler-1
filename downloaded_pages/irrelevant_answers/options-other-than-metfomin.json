Carbs can make you feel sick and get the runs if your taking Metformin. I am taking 1500mg, 500mgs 3xs a day. Always with food or milk. Did your DR prescribe folic acid with that. I'm taking 4 - 1mg tabs aday. When I was taking it in the morning with the Metformin I would feel sicker. I started taking th folic acid with my metformin at night with dinner and would feel sick.",
