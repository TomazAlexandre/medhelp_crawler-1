            "answer": "Type 1 diabetics can eat what everyone else can eat as long as they eat in conjunction with proper insulin. However, they should consume a healthy diet, of slow digesting carbohydrates. Things like pastries will raise his blood sugar quickly, and could cause him to go high if hes not careful, not to mention the other negative aspects of that style of eating. I would encourage him to eat fruits, vegetables and lean meats so that he may maintain a healthy diet, that will also be easier on his blood sugar response.",
