            "answer": "Well, I just had my glucose test done yesterday and I am 27.5 weeks. So it may seem a little early. But if you are concerned you should really just ask the nurse or your doctor and I am sure that they will be happy to tell you. I just know that all doctors do everything very differently. And about the weight gain I would not be too worried about, as long as your doctor has not brought it up to you. 26 pounds is within the range of 24.5 weeks and it depends on if you were under-weight when you got pregnant. Everyone is different so don't freak out!!!! :)",
