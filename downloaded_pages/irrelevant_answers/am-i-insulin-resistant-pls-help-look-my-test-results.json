            "answer": "Hello,your fasting levels are normal.\u00a0\u00a0However your early response to the glucose drink was not normal.given that you also have PCOS you have a high risk of developing diabetes in the future.Some doctors will diagnose prediabetes based on one or 2 abnromal numbers in a glucose tolerance test and some won't.I happen to beleive that your numbers are not normal.\u00a0\u00a0 Truely nromal and your numbers would all be within range.You don't have overt diabetes, but you should take this as your 'warning' that\u00a0\u00a0you could get it in the future.I woudl strongly recommend you get serious about regular aerobic exercise, if you're not already, and consider a lower carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0Weight management with PCOS can be very challenging.Please also make sure that you are monitored for thyroid function.\u00a0\u00a0Thyroid can also be more common in women with PCOS.My story.\u00a0\u00a0My initial diagnosis 12 years ago was PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0Soon after that I got diagnosed with hypothyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Then in the past 4 years I have developed diabetes (it came on very early in my pregnancy with my daughter and never went away after).If you have stomach issues also read up on celiac and see if it rings any bells for you.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Hi there,I agree with Super_sally888 that you are pre-diabetic because you have 2 abnormal readings, that's why I always monitor my glucose reading ONLY one hour after meal. I don't know why many diabetics 2 monitor their glucose reading after 2 or 3 hrs after meal , they just follow the very old info from 30 or 40 years ago which is now incorrect.Now, if I were you, I would read this book : Diabetes Solutions by Dr. Richard Beinrstein , or at least log onto Amazon.com to read the reviews of that book, you would see how many lives saved by DR.Beinrstein.Good luck.",
