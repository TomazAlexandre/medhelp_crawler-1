            "answer": "Hello,are you monitoring your blood sugars?\u00a0\u00a0What are your numbers fasting, and 2 hours after eating.Uncontrolled blood sugars can cause foot deformities.See if your doctor can give you extended release glucophage instead of metformin, this may help with the nausea.Start on a really low dose of metfomin, say 1/2 a tablet and then only increase slowly. Every couple of days.\u00a0\u00a0Have read it can take about 2 weeks for the symptoms to tone down.\u00a0\u00a0IF they don't you may not be able tolerate metforming and may need to consider another medication:\u00a0\u00a0insulin or something else.Do not ignore this.\u00a0\u00a0It is terribly important to get your blood sugars under control and as close to normal as possible.This means fasting should be ideally < 100 and 2 hours after eating should always be < 120, but ideally M 100.",

            "answer": "One common side effect of Metformin is gastronomic - nausea, upset stomach. It is advised to take Metformin with food, usually in the middle or end of meal. Metformin ER version releases the drug more slowly and this usually eliminates the gastrointestinal problems. Ask your doctor if you could try a weeks supply. Discuss with your doctor an alternative medication if Metformin ER gastro problems continue. Not everyone can tolerate the same medication, even in different forms.I can't move/lift my lil toe/s unless I move/lift the others. Been this way as long as I can remember. However, if your diabetes has been uncontrolled and unmanaged for 10 years it is quite possible that you are experiencing minor peripheral neuropathy, nerve damage caused by diabetes.I suggest you read other forum threads to understand what lifestyle changes you must make in order to prevent the onset of diabetes side effects. The nasties are blindness and amputation. Good luck",

    "question": "Hello, I'm new to this forum, but thought I'd ask a couple of questions.I was diagnosed about 10 years ago with Type 2 Diabetes (I'm 33), and I've never really been under good control.I have been prescribed Metformin, but it always makes me so sick (Low Blood Sugar feeling as well as diarrhea) so inevitably I stop taking it.\u00a0\u00a0My first question is, does anyone know how long it typically takes for these side effects to subside?\u00a0\u00a0I want to keep taking the medication, but it's so hard when it makes me feel so sick.My second question is that recently I've noticed that my 5th toe (pinky toe) on my left foot won't move.\u00a0\u00a0I try to move it but can't.\u00a0\u00a0This understandably has me quite worried, and obviously I want to get my BS down, but with the Metformin making me so sick, I feel like it's impossible.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know what might be causing this problem with my toe?Thanks so much.",
