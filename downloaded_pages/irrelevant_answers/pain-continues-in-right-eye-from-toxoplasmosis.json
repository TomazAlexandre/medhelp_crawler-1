Last one I had a year ago was going to do an MRI to check for MS at one point but new doc up here thought there was no need to.\u00a0\u00a0I hate moving and switching docs, but if you gotta move to where the jobs are, you gotta move.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise it's no health insurance and no food on the table.",
