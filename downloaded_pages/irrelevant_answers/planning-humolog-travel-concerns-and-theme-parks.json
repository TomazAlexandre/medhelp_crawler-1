            "answer": "I think I am just the person to address your concerns.\u00a0\u00a0Having had diabetes for 40 years and having traveled extensively both in hot and cold weather, I consider myself very creative and adaptive to most situations. I have also spent some time in the \"Disney Worlds\" with my own daughter when she was about three, so I have\u00a0\u00a0a few words to say about that experience.First of all, I applaud you for taking on this adventure and for not letting diabetes get in the way of anything you or your daughter want to do.\u00a0\u00a0I have lived my life with this philosophy and it has served me well. Diabetes does not have to get in the way and there are a lot of us out here who are proof of that.I am certain that the guest relations at Disney would be very accomodating, but I never went that route.\u00a0\u00a0Partially because, I didn't want to be tied to the Guest relations location anytime I wanted my insulin or a snack.\u00a0\u00a0Disney World is a big place.\u00a0\u00a0I carried a small back pack that had one of those small insulated lunch bags in it.\u00a0\u00a0I had a small ice pack for the lunch bag and I put my botttle of insulin in that along with whatever supplies I needed, syringes, blood testing stuff, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I also put some snacks and drinks in the back pack.\u00a0\u00a0Disney can be pretty rigid and they don't like you to bring your own stuff in, but I think you can explain why you need to have your own snacks handy at a moments notice.\u00a0\u00a0Food and drink lines can be long at Disney which is why I like to have emergency supplies with me at all times. I don't think they ever checked my bag, but they might.\u00a0\u00a0There are also lockers at Disney World that are out of the direct heat. You can rent one to put extra things in that you might not want to carry around all day, but that you might need during a long day at the parks.I don't know if you have other children, but if you are going with just a three year old, be prepared for many stops and detours.\u00a0\u00a0Our biggest mistake with our daughter was trying to do too much. Through adult eyes, there is so much to see and you want to make sure you don't miss a thing. Through their eyes, every thing is so much to see and they can get overwhelmed pretty easily.\u00a0\u00a0Every child is different, but don't be surprised if yours finds even the most benign rides frightening.\u00a0\u00a0Characters are larger than life and animated creatures (even friendly ones) pop out at you as you ride through dark tunnels.\u00a0\u00a0Some three-year olds just don't know what to make of all this unexpected \"fun\".\u00a0\u00a0After \"white knuckling\" it with our daughter for several hours, we gave up and spent the next few hours on her favorite \"ride\", the ferry boat that went around the property to all the hotels.\u00a0\u00a0We ended up going to the beach at one of the hotels the next day, making the wise decision to save our tickets for a few years later.Your dauhgter may have a completely different experience and may outlast you. My best advice is go with few expectations and follow her lead.\u00a0\u00a0As far as diabetes goes, just do the same things you would do at home. Even though she is young, this is the best lesson you can give her about her diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Lots of luck and have a great trip!ES",

            "answer": "Like ES, I'm a volunteer here and am a long-time diabetic, too.\u00a0\u00a0I echo ES' sentiments about travelling prepared but also enjoying all life has to offer with our without diabetes.On pre-drawing insulin, I have read that some insulins degrade rather quickly in plastic (that's why, despite disposable syringes, our vials remain glass), so I don't recommend relying on pre-drawn syringes.\u00a0\u00a0You might try reading the specifics in the insulin package inserts.\u00a0\u00a0Novolog is approved for use in pumps, which use plastic reservoirs and tubing, so it may do better than some others.You might consider talking to your child's endo about using an insulin pen, instead.\u00a0\u00a0It's convenient since the insulin & the delivery mechanism are integrated.\u00a0\u00a0There are some designed for munchkins who often need very small doses.\u00a0\u00a0Here's info on the one using Novolog insulin.\u00a0\u00a0These pens can use B-D needles which come with very fine gauge for comfort.http://www.insulindevice.com/novopen_jr/ http://www.diabetes123.com/d_06_367.htmI also have used a product that I can highly recommend for keeping insulin (in my case, my pump) at a safe temperature for many hours without electricity or batteries.\u00a0\u00a0The product is from a company called Frio and here's a website with information:\u00a0\u00a0http://www.coolerconcept.com/Just to be clear, I have no connection to this company and I don't have any personal benefit from recommending these products or the associated websites to others.\u00a0\u00a0I learned about the products, tried them, and can recommend them with good conscience.If you're working with a travel agent be sure to mention diabetes and you may find that special accommodations are waiting for you.\u00a0\u00a0On a cruise this summer, I found a handy sharps container in our state room :-)\u00a0\u00a0If this is your first trip, here's a tip I for your supplies.Bring at least twice as much as you normally need for the period of travel.\u00a0\u00a0Since your schedule will be different from home, you might want even more testing supplies to allow you to test whenever you think it's needed.2-3 times the usual qty will give you plenty in case of delays due to weather or having-too-much-fun-to-come-home-yet ;-).\u00a0\u00a0If you travel by plane, be sure all the supplies and insulin are distributed in your carry-on bags, not the checked luggage.\u00a0\u00a0Even tho' you bring extra supplies, the point is to have it all available to you -- and luggage sometimes doesn't arrive on time or intact.Carry written Rx for all your supplies and insulin as well as Rx labels for your current supplies.\u00a0\u00a0The written Rx helps in the event that all the backup stuff gets damaged or lost (I've dropped vials of insulin on a tile floor, for example <sigh>).I'd like to emphasize ES' point that having your own glucose tabs, small juice boxes, easy snacks etc. will help ensure that delays with food don't become a medical issue.\u00a0\u00a0With your careful advance planning, you're all sure to ENJOY your adventure!",

    "question": "After 3 months of adjusting to the hurdles since diagnosis of our 3 year-old daughter, we've received some encouraging news from her first A1C.\u00a0\u00a0Our next challenge is to plan a trip to the Magic Kingdom in 6 weeks.Our main question/concern include....\"What are the best suggestions for handling a day's worth of Humolog and snacks, where your likely to be shaken, splashed, and subjected to temperatures approaching 90 degrees F?I've seen wallets with tiny \"cool-packs\" of questionable duration, and wondered whether a pre-drawn syringes for the day would do a better job at protecting the main supply back in the hotel room.Bonus question:\u00a0\u00a0Besides starting out at theme park guest relations, are there any other suggestions for optimizing this visit for a type 1 toddler?Double bonus:\u00a0\u00a0My assumption is that Disney would be more accommodating to our circumstances than Universal, but I have no basis for this other than the marketing and that friendly looking mouse.\u00a0\u00a0Does anybody have comparative experiences that would help the father of a 3 year old plan more effectively?",
