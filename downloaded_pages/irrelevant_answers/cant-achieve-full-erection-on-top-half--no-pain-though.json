            "answer": "Hi there!Erectile dysfunction can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, performance anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. just to name a few. None of the medical conditions is the past history is likely to be responsible for the condition in your case. Anxiety and stress play an important role in the development of erectile dysfunction; and is the most common possible cause. At a primary level, I would suggest being a bit relaxed and working on the psychological factors. You could also see a psychotherapist/ behavioral therapist for the same. It might also be beneficial to get rid of factors like smoking/ alcohol/ drugs, if involved. In case this doesn\u2019t work, or you have difficulty controlling anxiety; I would suggest seeing your primary care physician for an evaluation of the above mentioned causes and appropriate specific treatment.Hope this helps.Take care!",

    "question": "Pretty sexually active, but the past two months I haven't been able to fully achieve an erection. The bottom half of my penis has no trouble getting rock hard but the top half always feels week and soft and isn't hard enough to penetrate my girlfriend.However, I have no pain, so I was wondering if anyone has any idea on what it could possibly be?!?",
