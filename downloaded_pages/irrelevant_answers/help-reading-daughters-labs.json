            "answer": "The important issues is that the TSH is down after starting levothyroxin.\u00a0\u00a0It is suggested to redo the test 6 weeks after the first one to see if both correspond or thereabouts, before a med. dose adjustment. If so might be able to tweak the doses to bring TSH down a little, which should bring up the FT-4 a little as well.I have read from others who had a TSH of 300 and 400.The goiter and cyst needs to be properly tested.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure the endo. is a thyroid specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Most deal in diabetes with thyroid being way down their list of expertise.Good Luck to the both of you.",
