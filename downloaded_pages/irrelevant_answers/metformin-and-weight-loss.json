            "answer": "Hi,Congrats on the weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0YOu don't need to diet to lose weight, but you do need a diet that will help control blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0Your levels of 120 - 150 are still too high.\u00a0\u00a0Can your doctor refer you to a nutritionist?ANyway,\u00a0\u00a0you need to control how much carbohydrate you eat at each meal.\u00a0\u00a0Following an atkins type diet (maintenance phase)\u00a0\u00a0/ lower carb diet is the way to go.\u00a0\u00a0Best way to work out what you can and can't eat is to test 2 hours after eating and to see what your blood sugar levels are.For example some people can't handle carbs well in the morning and need to have a protein breakfast (ie. fried or boiled eggs / a piece of fish, some mushrooms, sauted onions, a little tomato), rather than the traditional toast or cereal. But then may find that can eat more carbs later in the day with blood sugar still ok.Try eating small snacks between meals, that combine carb/ protein / fat also.\u00a0\u00a0These will help keep blood sugar levles stable.Cut off above which damage starts occurring is 140.\u00a0\u00a0So ideally you'd keep your blood sugar below this level at all times.Get educated.\u00a0\u00a0It's well worth it for long term health and well being.Limit anything white (sugar, bread, rice, pasta).\u00a0\u00a0Try wtih say just 1/2 cup of rice / pasta, small potato, then the rest of your meal would be green and orange veges, meat / protein, salad.",

            "answer": "Not to make your life more complicated, but you also want to get checked to make certain you are in fact Type II. Unexplained weight loss is more a symptom of Type 1 and LADA/1.5. 20% of people diagnosed Type 2 are in fact Type 1.5. I was 58 when diagnosed, not a lot younger than you and they just assumed Type 2 by my age; the treatments are quite different.",

            "answer": "Yes, zoela is right.Type 1.5 is often discovered when patients don't respond to oral meds, and/or the diabetes progresses very quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Type 1.5 is autoimmune and may occur in thin people.\u00a0\u00a0losing weight doesn't help much or for very long.Type 1.5 is usually treated with insulin fairly early in the course.Here's some more information:-Type 1.5 Diabetesaka Slow Onset Type 1 and LADAType 1.5 is one of several names now applied to those who are diagnosed with diabetes as adults, but who do not immediately require insulin for treatment, are often not overweight, and have little or no resistance to insulin. When special lab tests are done, they are found to have antibodies, especially GAD65 antibodies, that attack their beta cells. This sort of diabetes is sometimes called Slow Onset Type 1 or Latent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults or LADA.About 15% to 20% of people diagnosed as \"Type 2\" actually have this type. They are often diagnosed as Type 2 because they are older and will initially respond to diabetes medications because they have adequate insulin production. The treatment the person is first put on may be diet, exercise, and standard Type 2 medications.Since insulin resistance is minimal or non-existent, medications designed to reduce insulin resistance such as Avandia and Actos are not effective. Other meds that stimulate the pancreas to produce insulin, slow digestion of carbs, or reduce excess glucose production by the liver are often effective in controlling the blood sugar for a few years.A misdiagnosis is easy to make when the person is older and responds well at first to treatment with oral medications. If someone does not clearly fit the model for Type 1, they may be mistakenly placed on oral agents even though limited capacity for insulin production remains. The immune system's slower and more selective attack on the beta cells allows these cells to function to a high degree for a few years. On average, insulin is required in half of those with Type 1.5 diabetes within four years of diagnosis, compared to over ten years in those with true Type 2 .",

    "question": "I am a 66 y/o newly diagnosed diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Went to hospital with chest pains and found out I was diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Miraculously no damage done to eyes, feet, kidneys but discovered a heart anomaly.\u00a0\u00a0I started out at 254 lbs and I dieted all last year and was unsuccessful with losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0On Dec 5 my doctor prescribed Metformin 1500 mg at night, but I have been taking in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0I was extremely nauseated and had diarrhea the first two weeks, but now I'm only have nausea very occasionally and getting better.\u00a0\u00a0The most amazing thing (I thought) was that the weight started peeling off me 2 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0I now weigh 238 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0That's 16 lbs since Dec 5. I got very anxious about the weight loss and thought I had cancer and then went to the pharmacy and started research and found out it was the met that was doing it.\u00a0\u00a0One morning I woke up and had shed 4 lbs overnight.\u00a0\u00a0I generally have very little appetite - use to lick my plate and now I don't finish even the smallest meal.\u00a0\u00a0I do seem to crave sweets late in the evening. (Maybe I SHOULD take it in the evening!\u00a0\u00a0I try to drink more water and eat a lot of yougurt but I'm not on any particular diet.\u00a0\u00a0My blood sugars are running 120 to 150.\u00a0\u00a0My problem is starch.\u00a0\u00a0I'm sure if I had stayed on a strict diet I would have lost 20 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't had diabetic counseling so I've been hunting here and there trying to figure out what to eat.\u00a0\u00a0I will say this - I'm not severely out of breath as I was before I lost these 14 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0It's 27 degrees F. out right now and I'm sweating at the nape of my neck.\u00a0\u00a0I had to turn heat off in the house and don't feel cold at all.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone else had sweating?\u00a0\u00a0I know I need to start exercising more and get a better diet, so I'll be working on that after the holidays.\u00a0\u00a0What I'm amazed at are the people I've met who have had diabetes II a long time and have never really got into trying to figure out how to eat, etc., etc.\u00a0\u00a0I would not be nerveous about taking met.",
