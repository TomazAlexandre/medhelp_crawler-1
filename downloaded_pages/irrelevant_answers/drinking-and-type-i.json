            "answer": "If you do much research about alcohol consumption and diabetes, you will read that the primary concerns when a person drinks heavily is that they may not be as aware of high or low readings. Alcohol consumption prevents the liver from dumping emergency sugars that the body needs when glucose levels start to drop because the liver is busy processing the alcohol instead. So a person can have a very severe hypoglycemic episode and not be able to recover because the liver is not doing its proper job. This is made more complicated by the fact that being in a drunken haze blocks the awareness of warning symptoms of both high and low sugar levels.",

            "answer": "Hi there I have had 13 years of dealing with IDDM and have found that initially\u00a0\u00a0alcohol lowers blood sugar but later as the ethanol is converted into glucose , BSL rises usually whilst asleep after drinking. Spirits are better than beer as beer has too many carbs. However dry wine I feel is the best. Here in Australia we are advised that 4 standard drinks should be the limit but most people say that if 4 is OK then 6 or 8 must be even better!!Good luck .",

            "answer": "I have been a diabetic since I was 14.\u00a0\u00a0I am now 48 and in better shape than most non-diabetics even tho I also have high chlorestrol and High blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I have been drinking since I was 18. I drink Beer on weekends, sometimes as many as 8, but try to stay in the six pack range.\u00a0\u00a0 Beer has a big reputation of giving us a \"beer belly\", you might not have that problem with whiskey.\u00a0\u00a0I found a new Budweiser beer called \"select\" that only has 3 grams of carbs per 12 oz beer plus it still has 5% alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have any trouble drinking, but have found that beer raises my blood sugar when I first drink and then over a couple of hours it will lower my sugar.\u00a0\u00a0So I always eat when I am drinking to stay away from the lows as mentioned above.\u00a0\u00a0Oh, wait a minute, there is one problem that needs to be noted. After a night of drinking with my buddies, I might wake up with a hangover, but usually I get over it by lunch time and I'm ready to go at it again.\u00a0\u00a0Be very careful of the unexpected lows that can come from alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0When I was about 15 there was a guy across the street that was a diabetic (35 years old and looked 60) that was an alcoholic, but I don't think he took care of himself, I don't know for sure, but I bet he died before he reached 40 because alcohol really aged him.",

    "question": "Hello everyone, I am a 29 year old insulin dependent diabetic and have been living with diabetes for 13 years. My controls are generaly quite good, my Hba1c is below 7, and I am on 4 shots a day (Lantus and Humolog) My diet is restricted to complex carbs white meat, veggies and fruit, and I eat at regulated times. My main vice so to speak is alcohol, I drink around 5 times a week and heavily (8 drinks plus) on the weekends. While i check my blood sugars regularly and havent found too much fluctuations when drinking(I mainly drink vodka and whisky) I was wondering if there are any long term complications with associated with alcohol consumptions even if sugars are maintained. I've heard various opinions from doctors/nurses etc that who have given my different weekly limits, however I'm not convinced.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to hear your thoughts on this..",
