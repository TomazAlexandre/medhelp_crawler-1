            "answer": "I think 'pressure wire' is another term for 'ffr' or 'Fractional flow rate'. As with an angiogram, they insert a catheter and then thread a wire up to the arteries of the heart, but with a tiny sensor on the tip which measures the pressure of blood around it. It detects the flow rate of blood and pressure, showing the cardiologist the blockages which are affecting the heart. This reduces having unnecessary stents fitted. They take a reading at the top of an artery, then pass the sensor slowly downwards, to the bottom, looking to see if the flow suddenly drops off at any point. If it does drop by a certain amount, then a stent is required. This technique has increased by 30% in the UK because if someone has 10 or more lesions, they used to be stented or sent for bypass surgery, still to be suffering angina afterwards. It could be that just one of those lesions is causing problems and just one stent required.",

            "answer": "If you imagine a long artery with disease affecting half of the vessel, it doesn't mean that all that section of disease is causing problems. It could be just a 2mm section for example and just stenting that tiny area could make all the difference. Very often they do an angiogram and give their verdict at the time, and then your case is brought up at a monthly or weekly meeting of cardiologists/surgeons to discuss further options. This is when they might come up with a requirement for more information. It sounds like a surgeon or cardiologist has raised the idea of FFR as a means to have a far more accurate picture of the problems.",

    "question": "Last year my husband had an\u00a0\u00a0an occluded obtuse maginal artery and\u00a0\u00a0and was given a drug eluding stent,He was diagnosed with cad he also has diabetes cholsetral and high blood pressure all being treated with 15 tablets a day.Ten months later he is in pain at rest all day so another angiogram shows he has 60% atheroma burden to lad with diffuse irregularity throughout,D1 shows severe diffuse disease throughout rca mild diffuse disease throughout ,They said they could not stent yet today i get a letter for a pressure wire test in 4 months??",
