            "answer": "Sorry to hear you've been having trouble. I'm not a doctor, and there could be many possible reasons for this problem. Have you injured that hand in the past? Do you do a lot of repetitive motion type work? If you have diabetes, the numbness could be related to that because nerves can be affected.About 2 years ago, I heard a woman in her 40s speak at a heart disease and women seminar at one of our local hospitals. She said one of the weird symptoms she had for a while before she was finally diagnosed as having heart problems (which she shrugged off) was a sore finger for no apparent reason.\u00a0\u00a0She talks all over the state to groups and said she has heard other situations like this from people in the audience, particularly women. So could numbness be related to an undiagnosed heart problem, I don't know. But in her case, her sore finger was, her doctors said--something I don't think most patients would've ever imagined.I would contact your regular doctor if you haven't already, make sure to let him/her know about any other symptoms you might be having--basically if you feel different than you usually do, be sure to let your doctor know in what way or ways. And make sure you've told your doctor your family medical history, if you can--any illnesses or conditions your biological parents, biological siblings, even biological grandparents have or have had in the past.Good luck,Yvette",

            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for your question.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms you are experiencing certainly sounds that you are experiencing Raynaud's phenomenon and in that blood vessel spasms occur due to cold weather or medical condition that block blood flow to the fingers, toes, nose and ears. Apart from cold temperature (frost bite), drugs that cause narrowing of arteries, atherosclerosis, arthritis and smoking may also cause these symptoms. To prevent this condition, avoid exposure to cold in any form, dress warmly, stop smoking, and evaluate other medical conditions with the doctor if you have any. Hope this helps.",
