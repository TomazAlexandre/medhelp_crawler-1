            "answer": "Hello,obviously you are having a problem tolerating byetta, and given that this is now 3 months and you have lost so much weight, I would think it may be rational to ask your doctor if you can stop this medication and try something different?Why did your dr. not decide to start you on Metformin?Have you been monitoring your blood sugars (while on byetta)?\u00a0\u00a0What is your fasting and post-eating blood sugars.\u00a0\u00a0What was your Hba1c when you started this med?\u00a0\u00a0Have you done any other relevant testing? If so, please also post results.",

            "answer": "My initial HgbA1c was 8. My fasting insulin level was high (sad to say I don't remember the number). I do random fsbs's twice a day, always below 200. The fasting bs's were between 130 and 150 initially, now usually between 100 and 120. The 2 hour post prandials are unpredictable (but always below 200). I'm actually a nurse (29 years working ER, night shift), and over the years have developed some bizarre (for lack of a better word) eating habits that I'm having to really struggle with. It used to be not at all unusual to go an entire shift (12 hrs) without eating, or eating whatever I could lay hands on. Not especially helpful for blood sugar control. My physician and I actually discussed metformin, decided to try the byetta, and it has worked well controlling the sugars. Just hasn't been great in any other way. I guess I've just tried to keep on with it because she and I both wanted it to work. But I am so ready to \"holler uncle\".",

            "answer": "Hello again.Your blood sugars are well above normal considering that\u00a0\u00a0normal fasting should be in the mid 80s and post eating should be < 120 (ideally).Considering your insulin levels are high, this means you have insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0I would recommend you go back to consider and try metformin / Glucophage, as the mechanism of this drug is to reduce insulin resistance.If metformin alone cannot get your hba1c below 6 (ideally into the low 5s, which is close to 'normal', then I would recommend you consider starting insulin.The state of the art approach for all newly diagnosed type 2 people (you can look up joslin diabetes centre), is to start them on metformin to reduce the insulin resistance, and then to give them insulin.\u00a0\u00a0If you are early enough in the diagnosis, you will need only low doses of insulin to get excellent blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0This is far safer and\u00a0\u00a0more effective than multi-oral therapy.Given your schedule you should be considering MDI insulin (this is multi daily injections) where you take the long acting and short acting insulin separately.\u00a0\u00a0This way you can match the insulin to your food intake and you don't need to eat on schedule.Eating low carb diet will also help with blood sugar management. Considering\u00a0\u00a0you already can go for long periods without eating also look into intermittent fasting.\u00a0\u00a0I have found it quite helpful for blood sugar management.Hope this helps.",

    "question": "I was diagnosed with type II diabetes 3 months ago. I was started on byetta at the routine initial dose which was increased 2 months ago. I am only taking byetta, and no oral hypoglycemics (metformin, etc.)I have lost 29 lbs in that length of time, primarily due to decreased appetite, nausea, and vomiting. I understand that this is in all likelyhood due to delayed gastric emptying. My question: Is this ever going to get better??? All of the information I have read leads me to believe that it probably should have, but nope....no way....same ol', same ol'.....shot, eat, nausea, vomiting. Repeat (excuse the pun) ad nauseam. Any advice would be appreciated.\u00a0\u00a0:~)",
