Either set an alarm clock, or get a\u00a0\u00a0spousme, partner, friend, etc, to help you - call, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Compliance doesn't guarantee success, but it certainly can't hurt.\u00a0\u00a0Since you are already F2-3, you might start trimming the salt and sugar from your diet.\u00a0\u00a0Eat losts of fresh fruits, veggies, eggs, fish (well cooked, never raw), stick to white meats, look up liver friendly diet on the browser and it will give you lists of good things.Again, welcome to the Forum, and hang in there!\u00a0\u00a0One step at a time wins this battle ---- and it IS a battle \u263a.\u00a0\u00a0 Pat",

The fatigue is the biggest annoyance, just being tired so pace yourself.\u00a0\u00a0Not everyone has the same side effects but it's good to read all you can on the forum so you can at least be aware of potentials.

            "answer": "I was (feeling confident) Genotype 2 and treated with 1000 mg of ribavirin (based on my weight) and Sovaldi (the standard 400 mg dose) daily for 12 weeks.At two weeks my ribavirin was reduced to 800 mg. due to anemia. The anemia was corrected though my blood counts did not bounce back to baseline till after I finished treatment (I had a 4 point Hgb drop in the first 2 weeks). Other than some tolerable shortness of breath initially (secondary to anemia) and travelling mouth sores (helped by biotene/peroxyl) and initial adjustment issues (first 2 weeks), it was pretty easy to get through.I finished August 15th. My first UND blood draw was not till after treatment though I probably became undetected between week 8 and 12. My 4 months post blood draw was undetected. My 12 week post blood draw will be November 20 th (if undetected I am told that I am considered cured).I have had know residual secondary issues related to treatment. I only left work early once during treatment and worked out throughout treatment, though I did modify my cardio a little bit.As Kim says, very doable. I feel fortunate. Good Luck Mel! Jo",

It is one of the extrahepatic manifestations of Hepatitis C.Morphologic Features of Extrahepatic Manifestations of Hepatitis C Virus Infection7. Autoimmune/Inflammatory7.1. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus\"Chronic infection with HCV is associated with insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and type 2 diabetes [61]. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes has been reported to be 14\u201350% in patients with chronic HCV infection [62]. HCV-associated diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance and does not appear to be associated with antibodies directed towards the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans [63]. The mechanism for insulin resistance is unclear, but it is thought to be secondary to viral induced adipocytokine release or HCV viral proteins directly interfering with inflammatory or muscle insulin signaling pathways [64]. HCV-related type 2 diabetes mellitus occurs in association with hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, and high levels of both tumor-necrosis factor and CXCL10 [65].\"http://www.hindawi.com/journals/jir/2012/740138/\"High prevalence of glucose metabolic disorders has been well documented in patients with chronic HCV infection, including insulin resistance (32%\u201370%), type 2 diabetes mellitus (14%\u201350%), and metabolic syndrome (26%\u201351%). In our study, type 2 diabetes mellitus was diagnosed in 79 of 280 patients (28.2%), which is a higher prevalence than that of the general population. ..... This finding is consistent with the study by Liu et al,5which reported a higher prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus in 155 HCV patients (19.35%) compared with that of controls (7.55%).A prospective cohort of Taiwanese patients found HCV infection an independent predictor of diabetes, especially for people who are younger, with a higher body mass index, or HBV coinfection.6Study showed that treatment with interferon plus ribavirin reduced the risk of glucose metabolic disorders in patients with chronic HCV infection.7In addition, insulin resistance or risk factors of diabetes in the CHC patients might reduce the effectiveness of antiviral therapy and the rate of sustained virological response (SVR).8,9 - \"http://hepatitiscnewdrugresearch.com/2014-extrahepatic-manifestations-in-hcv-include-fatigue-diabetes-fever-and-thyroid-dysfunction.html",

It was devastating since I responded to treatment so well and was assured\u00a0\u00a0my genotype was more responsive. I was in denial and depressed for awhile.Last week I started solvaldi and riba. We have upped the riba dose to 1200mg a day from 800mg.I am concerned since after my last treatment I have developed\u00a0\u00a0type 2 diabetes which is weird since I never\u00a0\u00a0had an issue before.
