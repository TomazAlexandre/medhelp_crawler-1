            "answer": "Hi,Calm down a bit. I don\u2019t think it is MS. Well it is good do an MRI to rule out MS.Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, vitamin deficiency, altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency or abnormal endocrine status.It's good to see a Neurologist and rule out any disease condition.Bye.",

            "answer": "Thanyou for your comments.I have since seen a neurologist and he said my symptoms are common. I also got an MRI which was okay!\u00a0\u00a0I am happy about that part as mentally I feel better now. The problem is I have been told that many of these problems can come about just because of stress. The thing is I think there is some other problem as my stress levels are not high now. It may have made my symptoms worse before when I was worried about MS. I have had blood work which was okay too, so not sure what else it coulod be.\u00a0\u00a0This week I have not had tingling or burning, but some nubness when I wake up, some joint pains, and numbness when waking up(maybe due to sleeping position, however only have experienced the last mth). Also right eye twitching and a weak feeling in chest when going to sleep.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions on what else I should test?My doctor who is a family friend has referred me to a cardiologist.thankyou for comments",

            "answer": "Hi just wondering what deficiences you think may not have been testesd for. My GP ran blood tests testing for things such as diabetes, thyroid problems, etc... and my neurologist said he had tested enough. Do you know anything that could cause these symptoms they may not have tested for.ThankyouAlso wondering if you think an MRI of spine would be useful, or not necessary if neurologist did not suggest it",

    "question": "I have had many problems over the last several months. It started with severe constipation where I needed to take lactulose, then chest pain and pain in jaw and ear. I go my heart\u00a0\u00a0checked out and it was\u00a0\u00a0fine. I am only 31.\u00a0\u00a0I then got a headache that remained for about a week, with a burning and tingling sensation as well as some muscle pains in many different parts of the body, primarily legs and arms. I started to freak out as if I punch in all my symptoms online MS seems to make sense. I live in Canada where rate is higher, however I am male and east indian which make rate lower. I have got a CT scan which was negative and am going to get blood results this week. If no problem I will see a neurologist. I am very worried it is MS, so next step may be an MRI, What do you think? Am I freaking out for no reason?",
