            "answer": "Hey Debby!With DM1 it would be risky to switch to a weight watchers diet; which focuses on creating a calorie deficit not recommended with juvenile diabetes due to risk of complications, even if you have been on the pump. Gluten free foods are fine, but these may not help with weight loss. The carb counting would be an efficient way, though you could try discussing it with your treating endocrinologist.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
