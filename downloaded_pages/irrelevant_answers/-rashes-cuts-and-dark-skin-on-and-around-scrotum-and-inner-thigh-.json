            "answer": "You may have a condition called Thrush.\u00a0\u00a0This is a fungal infection and needs to be treated with antifungal creams or a one dose oral capsule called Fluconazole that is swallowed with water.As a home remedy apply natural live yogurt to the cleaned and gently dried area.\u00a0\u00a0Yogurt helps to cool down the itchiness and also helps alleviate any inflammation on the skin.Do you have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0If your sugar level is not controlled or you have a very sugary diet that can bring on fungal problems.Don't use soaps and shower gels to wash in that area because it dries the skin and changes the pH level of the skin.\u00a0\u00a0You need to keep the area clean, use an antifungal cream and also a moisturiser in between times.Don't wear tight clothing.\u00a0\u00a0Cotton underwear is best.Try not to scratch the itchy area, this will aggravate the skin even more, cause the bleeding and also thicken the skin.\u00a0\u00a0You can also bathe in warm water with a couple of handfuls of oats.\u00a0\u00a0You may find a bath emollient useful too.\u00a0\u00a0You should be able to buy the antifungal cream, capsule and the bath emollient from the pharmacist.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "I am sorry, but I do not know what you have available in India, I am from the UK.If you make an appointment to see your doctor, he would be able to prescribe the correct medication for you and check your HAB1C blood sugar level by a blood test.\u00a0\u00a0This shows the average blood sugar over a period of 9-12 weeks, which is a more accurate glucose reading.If you are not able to see your doctor, ask the pharmacist for genital antifungal creams.The oral capsule is called Fluconazole.The creams that may help you is Canesten, Trimovate, Lotriderm.\u00a0\u00a0Lotriderm is a potent steroid and you may not be able to get Trimovate or Lotriderm without a doctor's prescription.\u00a0\u00a0Your pharmacist should be able to help you if you tell him the problem that you have and he will be able to recommend an antifungal cream that is available without prescription.Dermol 600 is a bath emollient.You may find that some moisture creams, Sudocrem, or creams for baby nappy rash may help to keep the skin moisturised, but these will not help any fungal infections.Applying natural live yogurt will help too.If you are overweight, it will help to lose weight (easier said than done).\u00a0\u00a0Wear cotton underwear and allow air to circulate in between your legs.Wash and dry the area gently regularly.\u00a0\u00a0At least in the morning and again in the evening.I do not know what a pp reading is as I have never come across this before so I do not know if your sugar level is within the normal range for a diabetic with a PP of 165.I hope that I have given you some direction for you to be able to ease the discomfort of the skin disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Do remember though that whatever you use, this condition does not go away for good and once you have it under control that it can flare up from time to time.I know it is very hard, but when the itching starts, cool the skin down by a cool shower or apply the natural cold yogurt to it.\u00a0\u00a0The more you scratch the more it will itch - it's a bit of a vicious circle.\u00a0\u00a0Not only that, scratching will thicken the skin.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Thanks a lot for your reply.I have done HBA1c many times in the past. It\u2019s around 6- 6.75. And I am not overweight my age is 34, diabetic for last 5 years( but well managed, but not on any medicine), weight 58.\u00a0\u00a0PP is after lunch (postprandial)I have tried the treatment u said. Its stopped itching and seems working. For your info I had Fluconazole 150 mg ( 1 tablet) but I could not get the cream u told so I got this one - Candiderma(composition -clotrimazole, Beclomethasone Dipropionate,Neomycin Sulphate)Please let me know the following things.1- How many tablets of Fluconazole 150 mg should I have?2- How long should I apply this cream?\u00a0\u00a0As I told u I had this on and off for quite a long time. Will it go completely? Or whenever it comes back I should take the same treatment.3-In the past it left back/dark area around inner thighs, if any treatment that can remove black/dark area.Again thanks a lot for your help\u2026",

            "answer": "You may need to have a more recent HBA1c blood test done and discuss the results with your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Skin problems are very common with diabetes and uncontrolled sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has told me that 6.5 is classed as diabetes and your doctor may prescribe you with Metformin.The Candiderma cream sounds fine.\u00a0\u00a0Read the instructions that came with the cream and use it as directed.\u00a0\u00a0You may need to apply it for a few days after the symptoms have gone.\u00a0\u00a0Afterwards you may need to use it again as symptoms do flare up.\u00a0\u00a0From experience it is not something that is treated and doesn't come back.One Fluconazole 150mg capsule should be fine.\u00a0\u00a0You will have had an instructions leaflet that came with the medicine.\u00a0\u00a0If you feel your symptoms have not settled after a week, then you could take another capsule.\u00a0\u00a0But do make sure that it is well over a week.\u00a0\u00a0This medicine is not one to be taken on a regular basis.\u00a0\u00a0 If you have a course of antibiotics - this can cause flare ups, ask your doctor for a prescription for the Fluconazole that you can taken after you finish the course of antibiotics.You can apply the cream to the dark area on your inner thighs if this is has symptoms of soreness and itching.\u00a0\u00a0The dark area is unlikely to completely get back to normal.Unfortunately as you have diabetes, the skin problem is something that you will have to manage.\u00a0\u00a0Don't use soap to wash down below as this changes the pH level and can aggravate the skin.\u00a0\u00a0If you can, buy Dermol 600 which is a bath emollient.\u00a0\u00a0Dermol 400 and Diprobase or Doublebase creams can be used instead of soap.\u00a0\u00a0If you do get soap, only use the unperfumed and mild soap.Best wishes.",
