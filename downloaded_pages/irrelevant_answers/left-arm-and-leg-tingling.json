            "answer": "Hi,One cause of tingling in the arms and legs could be peripheral neuropathy. It can occur due to diabetes or even due to deficiency of vitamin B 12.I would suggest you to get your blood sugar test done and also start taking OTC B12 supplements and see if they help.If your symptoms continue to progress then please schedule an appointment with a neurologist and undergo a complete neurological exam.",

            "answer": "Hi,If salt made you feel better, lack of electrolytes like sodium and potassium may be causing your symptoms.It is important to maintain fluid balance especially while exercising. Please make sure you drink at least 6-8 glasses of water in a day.Are you taking any medications for alopecia? If not then I don\u2019t think it will make any difference to your symptoms. Do keep us posted!",

    "question": "Hi, I am 27 and enjoy running,biking, and other sports and sometimes do them in excess of 2 hours. I live in Arizona so it gets pretty hot. Last year I woke up at night (during the summer) with tingling in my left arm and leg and it progressed to my face. I went to the doctor and they checked for symptoms of a stroke (which were negative) they took a few blood tests and put me on a drip. The said they notices something a bit high in my muscles and suggested myalgia??After about two hours they said they didn't know what was wrong with me but if it reoccured to come back.. So it went away. I thought maybe that it might be due to losing alot of salt while exercising.Last night, a year later, I was very restless and today I am getting the tingling in my arm and leg and I dont feel very good. I am wondering could it just be low-salt or should I worry about some other symtoms.Thanks very much",
