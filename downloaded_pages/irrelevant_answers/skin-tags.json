            "answer": "Hello,What is the exact cause of skin tags is not known but it can be caused by rubbing or friction of the skin, HPV virus exposure, pregnancy and heredity. Some medical conditions such as obesity, diabetes, insulin resistance and atherosclerosis are associated with more frequent skin tags but that does not mean that you are having diabetes. You can get your blood sugar levels checked but stopping eating high sugar foods is no treatment for skin tags which are already there.Treatment options include removing with scissors, freezing (using liquid nitrogen), and burning (using medical electric cautery at the physician's office). You should consult a dermatologist to find out which treatment is the best one for you.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

            "answer": "Thank you for responding. I have had dermititis in on my neck and did alot of scratching there two years ago. I also have HPV and My mother has hx of skin tags.\u00a0\u00a0Therefore i can see that i have a propensity towards them. My derm doc says he likes to cut them off, feels that is the best way to get rid of them. wish he did with about 20 of them a few weeks ago. I am frustrated though because all of it seems to be a temporary fix as more seem to grow. I use a good sunscreen now to help from sundamage.\u00a0\u00a0I find it so amazing that you responded from India, i am still amazed by the internet.\u00a0\u00a0thanks again.",

    "question": "I am 52 year old female with hx of lots of sun exposure in the past. The last 2 years I have had a rapid increase in the number of skin tags appear on my neck and chest area. My dermatologist has cut and froze many. But I am worried they will continue to multiply by the dozens year after year. Recently I did internet search and many \"natural healing \" sites state that skin tags are a sign of pending Diabetes. I do crave sweets and consume too many deserts, I am about 20 lbs over wt. Should I be tested for diabetes ?\u00a0\u00a0If i eat drastically reduce my sugar will the skin tags stop multiplying? Naturalists endorces oils of sorts to stop growth, does any thing really stop them?",
