            "answer": "Hi altho this site is a heart site Medhelp has a wonderful diabetes site that is super active and personally i don't believe what you are posting is heart related.\u00a0\u00a0When someone has Type II Diabetes any change in the body odor that comes up suddenly is a red flag for sure and you need to contact his doc as soon as you can.\u00a0\u00a0It may be an indicator of something else that is going on within his body and his apocrine levels are changing and it could be due to some sort of bacteria in his system or some sort of infection that you may not even be aware of at this point that is rearing its ugly head.\u00a0\u00a0With diabetes the smell of alcohol on the breath in certain situations does pop up and again it is not a sign of anything good.\u00a0\u00a0Contact his doc asap and the stenting no doubt has nothing to do w. what you two are experiencing and the heart attacks should not figure into it either.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you both.",
