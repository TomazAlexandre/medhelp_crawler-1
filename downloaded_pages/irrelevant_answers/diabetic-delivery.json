At around 4 am on the 26th I woke up thinking I was sweating really bad and had to tinkle so I got up and went to the bathroom when I wiped there was slime everywhere (my mucus plug). when I went to go back to bed I noticed a puddle where I sleep so I woke my husband thinking I tinkled on myself and went to shower where I realized this was my water breaking cause\u00a0\u00a0liquid was just running down my leg and I couldn't stop it. so we calledthe hospital at this point I wasn't having contractions at all but halfway to the hospital I started having strong contractions.when we got to the hospital the security guard tried to get me to wait until she made badges but changed her mind when I told her she would have to clean up the floor if I stood there longer and laughed (she was just doing her job which I appreciate so I wasn't mad). when we got upstairs it was during a shift change so I was the attendings last patient. we laughed about the whole sweat theory but it's not uncommon to mistake urination for breaking there was a gush ofbwater when he went to check and I was at 4cm 60%. that was around 5 am they placed an epidural which caused decreased functionin my right leg (I kept saying it felt like a marshmallow and thatno couldn'tvlift my marshmallow) the nurse had to lift bend and hold my leg whenever I was checked. another doctor came in and said checked and said there was another sac of water a fore sac apparently which she broke. I labored for almost 12 hrs and at 410 pm the nurse who was wonderful had me start\u00a0\u00a0pushing with the directions of we're going to do this in spurts of three but when I say stop you stop immediately cause I don't want to catch your baby. my husband could see his hair and part of his head but he kept seesawing. then finally she told me to stop then avwhole team of people came in street commencing pushing his shoulder got stuck for a second and at 440 Chase was born 9lbs 5.7 ounces 21 inches...hee didbhave low blood sugar forva day but it was improved with breastfeeding.",
