            "answer": "Hello and welcome to the forum,I wouldn't consider a six pack a week as heavy drinking.\u00a0\u00a0The knowledge that I have is that xanax and Seroquel do not have an impact on your liver. Also 50 mgs of Seroqeul is very low dose.\u00a0\u00a0I am on 600.\u00a0\u00a0However it looks like you have hepatitis c and you probably know you shouldn't drink because of that.\u00a0\u00a0There are likely a lot of medications that effect your liver.\u00a0\u00a0The only ones I know of are Tylenol and pain medicines that contain acetaminophen, but I am sure there are likely a lot more.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway that is the extent of my knowledge on this and maybe someone else will have first hand experience to help you more.Larry",

It would be essential to discuss all this wth your psychiatrist as to potential health effects.\u00a0\u00a0Also drinkng can make many medications less effective. It would be worthwhile to discuss this with your psychiatrist as well.",

    "question": "Hello, I have been taking Seroquel at 50MG for about 7 years at bedtime with .5 mg of Xanax all prescribed for Mood/Anxiety Disorder.I wanted to ask, if I were to drink heavily (six pack) once a week, would this affect my liver functioning due to these medications, specifically Seroquel? I used to drink more, but cut it back to only once a day last few months.Last liver test was alright, but bilirubin levels were high normal.thank you. Just wanted to know if the fact that the dosage has been taking for a long time emant that the body has been tolerating it alright, or if it was making my liver worse and it was bad to mix any kind of alcohol?",
