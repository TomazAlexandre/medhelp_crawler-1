    "question": "I have a question for the ladies who have had GD in previous pregnancies or are further along and have GD, how standard is it to be sent to have a fetal echocardiogram? I have twice a week NST (where they monitor heart and movement)\u00a0\u00a0because I was thought to have cholestasis(but I don't) and today I went in and every time the doctor reviews and for anything that I may need either stay longer or monitoring or go to L&D well today I was told that I need to do a fetal echocardiogram, she said because of my GD it's standard for me to get this done. This is the first I've heard of it and now in worried something isn't right. So how many mommies have had to have done baby fetal echocardiogram, why and what was the outcome?",
