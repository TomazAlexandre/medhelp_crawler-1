            "answer": "Hi,It will help us to know if your daughter has been evaluated for high BP, diabetes and high cholesterol. These are risk factors for white matter disease and affect its progression.It is really difficult to give an opinion without looking at the results of her investigations and clinical exam. It will also help to know the medication history and is there any relief in symptoms with them.I would suggest you to seek a second opinion with a neurologist. Thanks",

            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for the update. I would suggest you to try alternate therapies for your daughter like acupressure or acupuncture or biofeedback since the medications are not working. Most of the pain medications if taken for too long can cause rebound headaches.Also make sure that she eats on time, sleeps on time and does some deep breathing exercises everyday. Hope this helps!",
