            "answer": "Thank you Dr Lupo, I did seek a 2nd opinion, the new endo said based on the sonogram I have Hashimoto's disease but with the size of my thyroid the only option I have is surgery for total removal, the sonogram said I had no nodules but the new endo did another scan in her office and found several small nodules on the left lobe and some on the right along with a grape sized one on the right. She said I can't be experiencing thyroid symptoms though because my thyroid still tests normal, the only symptoms she can attribute to the thyroid is the swollen neck, sore throat , dizzy spells I get when I raise my arms as the swelling has compressed my right carotid artery and swollen tongue. She did a bunch of blood work including the PTH and is sending me to the surgeon who specializes in thyroid cancer and parathyroid disease, not saying I have C, but due to the fact she thinks the thyroid has invaded sensitive areas I need the best surgeon out there and if it turns out it is C then i will be under the best care.",
