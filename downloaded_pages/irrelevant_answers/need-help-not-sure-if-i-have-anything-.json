If they draw blood and only order it to be tested for hepatitis that's the only thing they test for.\u00a0\u00a0They don't look for any signs of hiv with any other blood test than a hiv test.Also there isn't a urine test that is going to be helpful for testing for herpes.grace",

    "question": "im not sure if i should be posting it on this particular forum but i didnt want to create a whole new thread.\u00a0\u00a0I recently got some blood drawn for hepatitis and just had a urine sample taken.\u00a0\u00a0The blood test came back negative for hepatitis but i have not gotten back the urine sample test.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering if anyone knew whether or not the doctor would be able to detect herpes or any other std in either one of those samples considering he was not necessarily looking for it; or will i need more blood drawn or a second urine sample taken specifically for an STD check. The reason i ask is because I've been having a bit more itching in the genital area and one day my right butt check and left leg felt a bit painful.\u00a0\u00a0I know these are possible symptoms but i wasnt sure how long the muscle pain should last to be considered herpes or another std.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not freaking out because i know anyone can get muscle pain but it was a bit unusual and i was with someone new about a month ago (protection was used).\u00a0\u00a0Thanks a bunch for your time.",
