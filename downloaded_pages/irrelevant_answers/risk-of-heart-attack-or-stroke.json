    "question": "I'm 25 years old, first pregnancy, 14 weeks, previously diagnosed with type 2 diabetes since the age of 18, that was poorly conttolled. I was put on insulin, and a few days after my sugar was conttolled, my eyes went so blurry that I can hardly read a digital clock. I got my eyes checked by a retina specialist and was told by my midwife the next day that I'm at risk of going blind, having a heart attack or having a stroke. She also said I need to decide if I want to continue my pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0My baby is absolute fine though. I'm the one at risk.My question is.. has anyone else been told this? What happened? Am in for sure going to go blind or have a stroke?I was too upset yo ask these Thursday. . Any info is appreciated!",
