            "answer": "Welcome....I wouldn't think that ANY food fat content would elevate his triglycerides off the chart.....Mild elevations can be a result of food, but normally high tris are a result of another disease such as Cushings, Kidney protein loss, Diabetes, Thyroid disease to name the main ones.Do you have a copy of his blood work so you can check other levels that may point to the direction of another disease? You need to get a copy if you didn't.I assume the Vet sold you a low fat prescription food? No, they're not tasty! If you are feeding dry kibble, you can buy a few CANS of the wet food from your Vet...Your dog may like it better or mixed.Here is a wonderful resource to evaluate different foods.....You can check fat contents of each.....Please remember, the higher quality foods will have the highest fat, so that may be a problem nutritional wise! :(I'm curious to know what you were feeding when this happened.....Thanks, Karla",
