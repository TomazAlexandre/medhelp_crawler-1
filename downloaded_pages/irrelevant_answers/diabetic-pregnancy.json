            "answer": "Make sure you eat right and follow whatever gestational diabetes program your Dr recommends. I got put in one and check my glucose levels 4 times a day, watch what I eat, and when I eat. For the most part its fine and under control now.Talk to your doctor to see your options. You might have a big baby, meaning c section to avoid broken bones in the baby by vaginal delivery.Just don't stress, it happens to even those that you don't suspect would.No one thought with my build I would have it, but I guess the hormones arent meshing well for me.",

            "answer": "Hi, I'm type 2 diabetic but only 7 weeks pregnant so a lot to come. I was on metformin and gliclazide before I got pregnant but they stopped the gliclazide, increased the metformin and put me on insulin, which has been increased today as my blood sugar levels are still in double figures and just too high. I've really cut down on my carbs and cut out the sweet stuff but still battling to get it down. I know how important it is now I'm pregnant but its not easy, especially now I have to remember to take insulin before each meal and at night and check my bloods 5 times a day. I'm so scared of any damage my high blood sugar is doing. I'm 38 and will be 39 when baby's due and I've too been very tired. Half hour walk round the shops and I'm exhausted. I can empathise it's not easy. I'm obese too. I was sent for an early scan too probably due to high blood sugar, age, weight and diabetes and they just saw an empty sac. Been for a 2nd one since and the same. Got my 3rd scan on Thursday and hoping I can see something this time. I'm so worried. I guess diabetes just adds loads of extra things for you to worry about. As long as your keeping your levels under control, which you are, then don't worry, everything else should be like a normal pregnancy. Baby might be big, but that's common in diabetes and you're in the best hands to deal with it. Really sorry to hear about last year, I guess you're gonna worry until this one is in your arms, that's to be expected. Try to think positive though, worrying won't help your baby. Talk to your diabetic nurse, diabetic midwife, community midwife, doctor, obstetrician, and ask them any questions you have or tell them your concerns. They should be able to help. Good luck with your pregnancy. Xxx",
