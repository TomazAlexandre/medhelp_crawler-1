            "answer": "A family history of diabetes can result with a diabetes gene being passed to the next generation by one or both parents, in rare cases from the grandparents skipping a generation. The problem area lays with the actual genetic testing as it's still not fully comprehended or in place.In your case, Ruthie, if you wish further analysis I suggest you get your thyroid and pancreas checked. A malfunctioning thyroid will disrupt pancreas insulin production. For the pancreas you want an insulin test to see how much insulin your pancreas is producing. Also, a C-Peptide test to monitor insulin production in your \u00dfeta cell. Google islet and \u00dfeta cell insulin production for more details.Lastly, have you inquired with your doctor where the A1c test measurements came from? His/her office? Outside lab? How often equipment are calibrated? There is always that chance that your blood sample got mishandled or was performed on uncalibrated equipment. Instead of beating yourself up why not get another A1c?",

            "answer": "Hi WaveRider, Thank you for your response.\u00a0\u00a0I do have a non functioning thyroid; I've had it for the past 3 years and take 50 mcg Synthroid daily which keeps my TSH in the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0I have a fraternal twin who does not have this issue, nor does anyone else in my family.\u00a0\u00a0As far as insulin, as part of the new sophisticated NMR testing, I had a Metabolic panel done where my fasting insulin was tested.\u00a0\u00a0The result was 3 uU/ml (optimal range is 3-9).\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what that tells me, though.\u00a0\u00a0I'm all for having those other tests but I don't think my doctor will go for it.\u00a0\u00a0My A1c was tested at a national outside lab, plus it's very close to my last A1c which was done about a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0Last year's was 5.8, this time it is 5.9.\u00a0\u00a0Both pre-diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0As far as being in my family, my material grandmother had diabetes, neither parent has it, but my brother does.\u00a0\u00a0He was on high doses of steroids for ulcerative colitis which caused the condition, but he said he probably would've developed diabetes anyway, only later in life.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if that's true necessarily.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I'll continue to do my best with my diet and exercise and if things progress in the wrong direction, I'll talk to my doctor about doing additional testing.\u00a0\u00a0His response to my 5.9 A1c is that \"it's acceptable\".\u00a0\u00a0 I do appreciate your information and advice, WaveRider.",

            "answer": "Hiya again Ruth!\u00a0\u00a0Your question is an excellent one!\u00a0\u00a0Considering that obesity is the leading cause of Type II Diabetes, what IF someone is of normal body weight?You also have to take into consideration that Type I and Type II Diabetes are REALLY very different animals in a LOT of aspects.\u00a0\u00a0If your genetic history has predisposed you to Type I diabetes, that's a lot different than if your family members had Type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The circumstabnces behind WHY and HOW your relatives were diagnosed is very pertinent too.\u00a0\u00a0For instance, my father-in-law had severe Type I DM as a result of a very severe infection he had in his late teens.\u00a0\u00a0That kind of circumstance isn't going to predispose his offspring like other causes would (i.e., being Dx'd as a child).\u00a0\u00a0It was an unfortunate outcome of the infection.You are right, to a point that you cannot \"beat\" genetics, so to speak.\u00a0\u00a0what you HAVE done, however, is drastically reduce your chances of becoming diabetic with your healthy lifestyle choices, and proactive approach regarding your health.I've already told you, that honestly, from everything you've posted, you sincerely have very little to be concerned about at this point.\u00a0\u00a0I do understand your concerns about the A1C, but overall, it's really not a worrisome result.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor was not at all concerned, and from your readings at home, it seems that really, right now, you are okay.My advice remains the same, for you to continue what you're doing as far as your health is concerned, and just follow up with your doctor annually.\u00a0\u00a0If your anxiety remains high about this, you could always talk to an endocrinologist (you may see one for your thyroid?).\u00a0\u00a0I think an Endo would be able to put your mind at ease a little more, and put a lot of this into perspective for you.\u00a0\u00a0I certainly appreciate your concern about this, but I honestly feel a lot of it is a bit disproportionate to the actual concern.Keep us in the loop!\u00a0\u00a0:0)",
