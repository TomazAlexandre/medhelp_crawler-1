            "answer": "Thanks, I am going to the doctor one day soon and making a list of things to get tested. This is one I want to add to the list.At least where there is a connection between HCV and diabetes, you will not have to worry anymore that the HCV is doing things here, or might make things worse.I think things sometimes take longer to swing back to normal. We first have a disease, then we are taking drugs that also change our body, then the immune system gets changed if it is no longer fighting infection, and a number of liver functions change as the body starts repairing. I think that all these things can upset the balance, the body needs to re-find it.I've been off TX for 15 months and still repairing it feels like, but in general things are improving; going in the right direction.I'm wishing the same for you.Merry Christmas and happy new year.I'm glad you are staying on top of it.~W",

That is how I was diagnosed.Again, great news that you are SVR. Dee",

            "answer": "Congrats on SVR!Regarding HbA1c result, it is affected not just by glucose levels but also by the\u00a0\u00a0degree of systemic inflammation the body experiences. Sovaldi and especially ribvirin are powerful drugs that can increase the levels of inflammation. Also, it is well known that ribavirin causes anemia in many people and may also impact the hematopoietic system as a whole.\u00a0\u00a0Since hemoglobin half\u00a0\u00a0life is ~4 months, I would wait at least half a year after the treatment before making the conclusions.",

    "question": "Hi all,\u00a0\u00a0I cleared HVC in October!\u00a0\u00a0YAY!\u00a0\u00a0Sadly, the treatment seemed to acclerate my \"pre-diabetes\" HbA1c test result.\u00a0\u00a0And my BG are not so good now.\u00a0\u00a0I know there's a connection between the two diseases.\u00a0\u00a0Felt (and still feel) pretty crappy after treatment (Sovaldi & Riba).Anyway, wondering if those of you with pre-diabetes or diabetes, have Type 1 or 2 and also if yours got worse after treatment.My little public service announcement for those of you who are not diabetic... have you ever had the HbA1c test?\u00a0\u00a0My fasting BG (which is the glucose number you get on a standard fasting blood test) has been and continues to be within a healthy range.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately that is NOT a true measure of how your body is balancing sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I got my first indication of a sugar imbalance on a HbA1c in a routine blood test so it came a shock to discover this!)\u00a0\u00a0Since there is a connection between the diseases it wouldn't hurt to ask your doctor for that extra test.\u00a0\u00a0My two cents.Hope everyone is doing well and fighting the good fight!\u00a0\u00a0V.",
