    "question": "Diagnosed w/bipolar within the past year and doc has me on 1500mg depakote and 300mg seroquel -- I'd say they give me 80% relief from my symptoms, I don't feel 100% well.\u00a0\u00a0But I feel like I'm in a fog all the time, I sleep 10-12 hrs. a night and when I wake up I just don't want to get out of bed and he gave me provigil to help me stay awake during the day.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I've gained 20 lbs!\u00a0\u00a0I asked for different meds but he doesn't want to try anything else which may not work as well as the depakote and seroquel.\u00a0\u00a0Am I doomed to feel like this the rest of my life, or should I insist on trying some different meds, knowing I may have to try several of them before I find anything that helps my symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Also, the darn meds cost so much -- I do have health insurance but it only covers part of the cost.",
