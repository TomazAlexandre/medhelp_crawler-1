    "question": "I'm 26w 5d I'm native american and at the hospital I'm going to I'm not paying anything.\u00a0\u00a0But id rather go to a hospital that doesn't take a long time to see the patient. Im waiting to move into a house but this realtor is taking forever to get the paper work done. I have 100days to go and they are going by quick. I have not got anything for my baby yet and it's getting close. I'm so anxious and scared because I dont know if ill be denied for insurance. My baby might come early because I have gest. diabetes they were not bad in the beginning but now my sugars have gone a little high it worries me because I can have complications. I have insurance now but it's under my dad (I'm 20yrs old) and I need to get my own for me and my baby. My bf wants to put me under his insurance but I'm not sure they will approve because we are not married we are only engaged. Everything is starting to stress me out because its getting close and time is going by fast and my baby can come at any time",
