            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Well a localized rash should ideally not be due to the medicine. However please call your doctor and inform him. Stop the medicine if he advises. There is a chance that you are allergic to the excretory products of this antibiotic found in urine and developed contact dermatitis on your urine coming in touch with it.Please take an antiallergic to overcome the symptoms until you hear from your doctor.Rash on penis could just be a coincidence.A red rash on penis that burns or itches can be due to balanitis or inflammation of the head of the penis and/or the foreskin. This can be due to bacterial infection. If you are sexually active then it could be due to chemical irritation of condoms. It can also be a STD.Please discuss this with your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you for your response. I spoke with my doctor today and have an appointment for tomorrow. I have stopped the antibiotics until then. He also wants to test me for diabetes, I guess this could be the cause of the infection and the rash, so I need that checked. I have risk factors for type II diabetes so I guess this is a good course of action. Thanks again for your response, and I recommend this site highly to anyone with health questions of this nature.",
