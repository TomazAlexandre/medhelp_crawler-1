            "answer": "Hi yuen,How are you feeling now?Any type of tingling, burning, severe pain, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The nerve involved appears to be originating from Cervical Vertebrae.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, and altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency, and abnormal endocrine status, compression of nerve or impingement of nerve at time of exit from Vertebrae.In your case I feel it is compressive pathology which is causing symptoms.I think you should consult a physician to evaluate your case.If required you can get a MRI scan done.It is premature and too early to comment about brain tumor.Hope this helps.Bye.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply. I will monitor it for a while and may consult a doctor after that to see whether MRI is needed to determine the actual cause of it. As what you have mentioned, could be due to some nerves. Will keep you update on my situation.Thanks again and Merry Christmas to you and your family.RegardsYuen",

    "question": "Last few days I have been thinking a lot and I felt there is a slight pulling, tingling sensation on my right side of my brain. The sensation, pain is located on the top right of the brain. Now, occasionally or I would say, often, I feel this in my head. My question is, is this a sign of primary stage of brain tumor? I am thinking of consulting a doctor, but I thought I have some feedback from here first. I never had this feeling before.ThanksYuen",
