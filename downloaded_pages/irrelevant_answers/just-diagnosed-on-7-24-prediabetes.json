            "answer": "Hello,sorry for slow response to you.The way to control blood sugar is through eating a low carb diet (if you have a meter you can test after eating to see which foods work and which don't), exercise, and ensuring your weight is optimal.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0With all of these, then you may be able to reduce your a1c, particularly if you are type 2 (and delay onset of diabetes for as long as possible).Type 2 is usually associated with insulin resistance.\u00a0\u00a0At least in the beginning there is plenty of insulin, but it is not working very well.Type 1 is autoimmune type.\u00a0\u00a0It is due to poor production of insulin /\u00a0\u00a0absence of insulin. Many with type 1 may have antibodies, which can be tested for.\u00a0\u00a0Other markers that may alert a doctor on the type of diabetes are; diabetes with thin body and athletic lifestyle, no family history of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In adults type 1 diabetes can be sudden onset or slow onset.",

            "answer": "As your pancreas is still producing insulin, but your body is not able to utilise it properly, you have Type 2 Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In Type 1 Diabetes, the pancreas does not produce any insulin or not enough.Speak to your doctor and he/she will be able to confirm which type you have.A reading of 98 mg/dl is 5.4 mmol/lBlood glucose typically varies from 4 mmol/L to 6 mmol/L for people without diabetes.What you experienced is what is called hypoglycaemia.\u00a0\u00a0What this means is that your sugar levels dropped too low.\u00a0\u00a0You will have learned now, by experience, that you must eat regularly and not go for long periods without food.\u00a0\u00a0You need to eat small amounts and more often.\u00a0\u00a0Avoid highly processed foods and sugary foods (unless you are experiencing a hypoglycaemic attack).Eating foods that are classed as complex carbohydrates is much better than processed and refined foods.\u00a0\u00a0The complex carbs break down more slowly in the body and will not give you a high surge of a sugar spike with a drastic drop.Don't forget that if you monitor your sugar levels my using a glucose meter, your sugar levels will also vary depending on which time of the day you take the test and what you have eaten and how much energy you have burned through exercise.The HBA1C blood test gives an average reading over a period of approximately 3 months.\u00a0\u00a0This is because the sugar sticks to the red corpuscles and these are renewed approximately every 3 months.Hope this helps.Best wishes.",

    "question": "Hello all I'm new to this forum but just wanted to know if my atc1 test came back with a reading of 5.8 and fasting glucose of 98 is there a way to make the 5.8 go down and not be prediabetic. There have been a couple of occasions where I felt like I was going to pass out and just felt bad I hadn't eaten one time and the other time I hadn't eaten very much.Thanks and also how does one know which diabetes they are headed for 1 or 2?",
