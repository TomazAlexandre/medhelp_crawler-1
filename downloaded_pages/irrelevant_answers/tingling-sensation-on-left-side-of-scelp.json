            "answer": "Hi KS,Feeling of tingling, burning, creepy or crawly feeling, suggest paresthesias. Any type of tingling, burning, or numbness is usually a symptom related to a sensory nerve being damaged, diseased, or injured. The area you are talking about is called C2-C3 dermatome. Usually it is physical injury to nerve like any nerve compression or direct pressure being applied to nerve, which causes these symptoms.Similar symptoms are common with patients of long standing Diabetes.If any of these symptoms are increasing and annoying, then you need to see a doctor, probably a neurologist to rule out any pathological state.",
