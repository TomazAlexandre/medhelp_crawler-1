            "answer": "This time of the year there are many bugs and viruses going round, so it is highly likely that you may be \"coming down\" with something.It is understandable that you feel down, especially as your girlfriend has left you.With the dreams that you have been having, seems that you have worries on your mind.The other reasons for feeling tired and especially if you are not eating properly, is having low levels of iron in your body causing anaemia.\u00a0\u00a0Make an appointment to see your doctor to get a blood test taken to find out if you are anaemic.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure that you eat properly with lots of fresh fruit and veg, fish, chicken, etc. and drink lots of water.If you are used to drinking a lot of coffee and cut down on this, that too can give you the shakes.\u00a0\u00a0It is normal to feel hungry if you haven't eaten for a long time.Being dehydrated (not having enough water in your body) can also make you feel tired.\u00a0\u00a0Try and drink at least 2 litres (4 pints) of water in the day.\u00a0\u00a0As you had not eaten much and started to feel shaky, mention this to your doctor too, as it may be a good idea to have a HBA1C blood test done to check if you have glucose intolerance or diabetes.Having depression can also make you feel like you do.\u00a0\u00a0So do speak with your doctor about your symptoms and how you feel.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor will need to check you out for iron and Vitamin B12 deficiency and diabetes as well as consider whether in fact you have depression that needs treating.Hope you get sorted out soon.",

            "answer": "As you have been feeling weird since you cut your arm, I suggest you get that arm seen to urgently.Go to the ER or make an urgent appointment to get the cut examined.\u00a0\u00a0You can catch bacteria through cuts and the way you have been feeling could be due to an infection from the cut and if it is infected you will need a course of antibiotics.\u00a0\u00a0 It the cut was done by an dirty object, you may need to have a tetanus booster as well.In the meantime, keep the cut clean and dry.",

    "question": "My original post (https://*****************/question/index?qid=20141002111840AAXPbjr):Abnormally tired. Scared. Advice please?I've been feeling weird recently since I cut my arm.Yesterday I smoked another cigarette, and I didn't feel good (nauseous, breathing, not feeling good), but it faded away.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't get much sleep the day before, and I didn't get a lot of sleep last night, but I got more.\u00a0\u00a0Fell asleep at 1 am, awoke at like 6 am due to weird dream abolish my arm, then fell back to sleep at around 9:30, awoke at 11:30ish.I also was scared about a creepy pasta I've read a few days ago, but not much anymore or right now.I had a weird dream about something kinda like what happened today with my mom (with going to my grandma's and work), and also that I was out of it as if I were going to do, especially after my friends with benefits/ex found a boyfriend, which in reality she said wouldn't happen and promised she wouldn't do that to me.Now we're driving to my grandma's (which was already planned btw), and I feel abnormally tired and out of it.Since I've been feeling like this for a bit, it's making me think about the possibility of me dying (the tiredness, irritation at times, laziness), but maybe it's depression or trauma.\u00a0\u00a0There's more information on my other questions.\u00a0\u00a0I need advice please.\u00a0\u00a0I wanna live btw lol.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, thanks.I took a nap around 6-6:30 pm and awoke at around 11:30 pm, and I feel tired.\u00a0\u00a0Not as tired though.\u00a0\u00a0I feel hungry, but haven't eaten.I went to a restaurant today, and I didn't eat much because I was feeling nauseous.\u00a0\u00a0At first, I thought it was because I drank coffee on an empty stomach, but I feel like I'm coming down with something but I'm not sure.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it isn't anything to do with my healing/recovery.\u00a0\u00a0I tried setting down and had a few bites of the healthy salad.I was feeling shaky before I took the nap, and now I feel achy, and not the greatest.Check out my link and the account for my other questions with more information in them.Thanks for any advice.",
