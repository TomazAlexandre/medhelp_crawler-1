            "answer": "Hey there, sorry to hear your Dad is struggling with his health. Sounds like he is blessed to have such a loving and concerned daughter.Angiogram is a diagnostic tool used to identify the degree of blockage in major vessels. The intervention for blockages are either major bypass surgery or angioplasty (inflating a balloon to open up the blocked artery). Unfortunately the femoral artery in the groin is the access point used simply because of our physiological makeup. It seems like the doctor has decided your father may not be a good surgical candidate so further diagnostics are unlikely to improve any health outcomes. These kinds of decisions are made when the risks clearly outweigh the benefits. A fever is a sign of an infection brewing somewhere in the body and must be treated aggressively. Vascular surgery puts your father at high risk of blood infection and his diabetic status increases that risk. Your father has enough heart muscle that is able to compensate for the weak muscle areas. Sometimes the electical nodes are damaged and are unable to send regular signals. This is where a pacemaker/defibrillator is essential. The heart is a pump that helps to keep fluid out of the lungs. An irregular rhythm compromises the heart's ability to pump blood effectively and fluid can build up in the lungs (pulmonary edema). A medication to prevent blood clots (warfarin) is important too. Heart disease and diabetes are two chronic conditions that can be effectively managed for years to come. The quality of life is dependent on management of troublesome symptoms like fluid build up in lungs and legs that challenge breathing and mobility. The best things to do to help prevent this from happening are: possible fluid restriction, weighing self daily to catch fluid building up before it goes to the lungs, lasix 2-3 times a day, potassium supplements, monitoring blood pressure and pulse and taking appropriate medications accordingly, low salt diet, pacing activities to conserve energy, using low doses of morphine and puffers to open vessles and airway to promote comfort of breathing, monitoring for lung infection and treat early if identified (wet, productive cough, fever, chills, difficulty breathing) managing diabetes through diet to keep blood sugar stable, reducing risk of infection (high blood sugar feeds bacteria). Home oxygen may be a great idea to help promote comfort and get him through tasks that demand the heart to work harder. He may only need to apply it to catch his breath or wear it most of the day, depending on what offers the most comfort. Quality of life is greatly increased when we empower ourselves with knowledge and direct our plans of care in ways that are meaningful to us as individuals. I hope this helps you two even a little. Well wishes to you and your father ;o)",

            "answer": "If your Father hasn't had a bypass operation, then the arteries in the arms can be attempted for access in angioplasty. It depends if they are straight'ish' or have too many turns in them, but the majority by far are accessible.I believe if necessary, they can also go in through the neck. It obviously depends on whether the cardiologist has had the necessary training. There are\u00a0\u00a0six cardiologists in my local hospital, and only ONE has had the arm training.",

    "question": "My father is a 76 yr old male, with Type II diabetes, poor circulation in his legs and just had his 4th heart attack. He has a 100%, 80, 70% blockage and a irregular rythm with a 2-6 second stop. He has trouble breathing and fluid in his lungs. They are giving him lazix to push the fluid out and he is pushing about 1500 ml of fluid a day. Currently he has a fever of 102. The doctors say they cant go through his legs because of the poor circulation. They are suggesting a defibiliator w/pacemaker to control the rythm isue but the heart surgery is not good. He has viable tissue in his heart based on his recent viability test. Can they do the angio through his arms. Can they do a graft from another part of his body? What quality of life can he have if he just gets the defibiliator and not fix the heart? Is their something I can give him that can help?",
