    "question": "I am a 24 year old female who is normally a very heatlhy person. About a week before my period I start getting cold and flu like symptoms. I ignored them thinking that I just have severe PMS symptoms.About six months ago I noticed a lump on the right side of my neck. The doctors have checked me for diabetes, mono, thyroid, lupus, and many other things. I have also had a CT on the neck and an upper GI. The upper GI came back clear and the ct showed that i had a mass in my neck but they didnt do anything about it. Lymphoma is strong in my family and I am a little nervous. What should I do?",
