            "answer": "I have felt exactly like you describe so well.\u00a0\u00a0I have not had the bypass surgery, but multiple stents, multiple stress tests, and never have they showed no problems.\u00a0\u00a0My heart problems started when I was fifty nine, that is when I had my first heart attack in 2000.\u00a0\u00a0Between then and 2007 I had two more heart attacks and eight stents, and a pacemaker.\u00a0\u00a0I was very discouraged.That being said, I was the poster boy for bad cardiac health before the heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0I worked in a very stressful position, had the stress of parents and loved ones with cancer/alsheimers disease, was overweight, diabetic, and rejected statins to lower over the top cholesterol levels.\u00a0\u00a0I dealt with those issues, and perhaps that is why my CAD has finally slowed down, apparently.I also believe the good drugs work wonders like Coreg, Vytorin, Imdur, Lisinopril, etc.I'm told I'm fortunate also that all the damage to my heart is in the lower part.\u00a0\u00a0I'm assuming that because the left ventricle is so important, damage there is worrisome.What drugs are you taking?\u00a0\u00a0Are you exercising, and following good cardiac health guidelines?Thanks for posting.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes",

            "answer": "I certainly understand your position and thought process.Where does it end and what are the best answers and treatments?You have pain AND have medical treatment. And you complicate CAD with diabetes or vice-versa.But have a discussion with your doctor about the affect of both on your cardiac microvessels, those tiny ones not seen by any cath or current technologies.Having a better understanding of what's bothering you is so helpful.If exercise brings on chest discomfort, be very careful.Don't push it.Read my journal here at 'joanincarolina' and see if it helps.My microvessels 'act' like they are under the influence of diabetes, brittle and stiff, but I don't have diabetes.And I too 'act' like all's ok, I even look very well.But I sure have your symptoms.Let me know.
