            "answer": "HiHave you had a cranial CT scan done during the incident of syncope?This sensation may be musculoskeletal or arthritic. I suggest that you have this assessed by your physician .A scan may be needed to rule out any structural or organic cause. Try to observe this sensation if it resolves over time. If it persists you may ask for a neurologic referral. At this point, I do not think this is something that you should be worried about.",

            "answer": "HiYes, I think a cranial CT or MRI may help rule out any underlying structural or organ cause of the headaches at this point. Also I just want to ask if you are postmenopausal and if you are taking any hormonal supplements?Hormone fluctuations may cause some flushing or sensation of warmth at certain times. I suggest that you also discuss this with your dermatologist for further assessment along this line. Also, were your neck vessels assessed? Was a carotid duplex scan of the carotid arteries done?",

    "question": "This is not a headache related question, but does involve a situation in with my head.\u00a0\u00a0Several months ago, I experienced an episode of syncope and was brought to the ER and hit the back of my head on the floor from a sitting position.\u00a0\u00a0I remember not feeling like myself, but remain conscious throughout.\u00a0\u00a0I could smile, say my name, S.S. #, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I noted on my discharge docs that the diagnosis was syncope and giddiness.\u00a0\u00a0Blood tests and an EKG were done to rule out heart attack, stroke.\u00a0\u00a0All tests results were negative; however, I have experienced strange and hard to describe sensations in my head/brain.\u00a0\u00a0I get a squeezing sensation that is followed by a release similar to the flow of a cracked egg and its spreading out.\u00a0\u00a0I feel fine and have not had any other syncope episodes in almost a year.\u00a0\u00a0I work full time and spend the majority of my day on the computer.Note:\u00a0\u00a0I take Diovan HCT for blood pressure and Metformin 500 mg for Type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Both are under control and I see my doctor every 6 months for same.",
