    "question": "My 3 year old daughter is incredibly small. Shes in 9 to 12 month clothing. Baby size 3 feet and she speaks like a little mouse. She seems normal in every other way. Her speech is great. Her appetite is fine. When she was 1 she was in 3 month old clothing.\u00a0\u00a0People used to wonder how she could walk or why we didn't protect her head when we held her as they thought she was alot younger\u00a0\u00a0. Should I be worried? She hasnt grown a inch in a year . She gags on her food sometimes too . She coughs all the time. Since birth. Seems soo chesty. Maybe im paranoid?",
