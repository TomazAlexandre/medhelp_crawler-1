            "answer": "Hello,Your fasting readings on 1 day was slightly high, but your random readings are fine.YOu could ask your Dr. to check HBa1c if you are really worried. A normal HbA1c is in the range of 4 - 5.0, but most doctors will tell you up to 5.7 or 6 is still ok.Just so you know, normal non-diabetic blood sugars are usually < 95 for fasting and in the range of 80 - 120 after eating.Hope this helps.",

I would suggest considering an evaluation by a primary care physician for an accurate diagnosis and appropriate management.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
