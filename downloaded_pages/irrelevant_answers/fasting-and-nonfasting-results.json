            "answer": "A Postprandial level of 217 mg/dl is unhealthy and leads to complications in the future. When responding it is important to tell the entire story not just a portion. Meat by itself, unless marinated in a sugary substance, will not elevate your blood sugars this high.A fasting level of 112 mg/dl is considered prediabetes. If you continue your current lifestyle by not making the necessary lifestyle changes you will become a diabetic. Currently there is no cure for diabetes.",

            "answer": "I agree with WaveRider; the postprandial was way too high. But you did not just eat meat for lunch. Meat has no carbs and won't raise your glucose. What was with the meat? Potatoes, bread, fruits, etc. all have carbs and will raise your readings. Also, what did you drink with the meal? Soda? Sweet tea? Coffee with sugar and creamer? You need to watch everything you take into your mouth! Write it down and keep a log of food intake, exercise and meter readings so that you can track what is going on with your body. Good luck.",
