            "answer": "Yes. Mention this. There is an abnormality in the microcirculation. It could be vascular, but generally is due to blood issues. You need a consult with a hematologist. This problem is often due to an abnormality developing in the red blood cells, making them larger than usual.",

            "answer": "Hey Dennis,I'm a purple/blue feet person, but whilst they look totally wrong when they go multi colored, they are actually otherwise normal, no heat, no swelling, no tingling, no pain etc nothing else but the colour changes when it happens. oh with the exception in cold weather of my usual overactive response of overly cold fingers and feet, which i've had all my life. When they change colour they still feel normal to me regardless of the temperature but if its winter they will also usually be freezing cold to the touch, with the lovely range of purples and blues. I'd mentioned it to my doc but had to take photos because it wouldn't show up on demand.The photos actually shocked my GP and the first time i went to the vascular clinic the nurse took one look at my wonderfully colored feet and next thing i know she's pulled the specialist into the room. It wasn't unusual to have family and friends saying \"OMG look at the colour of your feet\" but it's not everyday you get the same reaction from medical people who you'd think would see that kind of thing everyday, um apparently not lol.I had my entire vascular system ultra sound and from my neck to toes, blood tests, pulse points etc and there was absolutely nothing abnormal found.Unknown to me until later disclosed, the specialist was involved in one of the large international CCSVI MS research projects, the specialist with a copy of my MRI, photos and test results discussed the situation with this research team of vascular specialists, the end result was they concluded that the only explanation was the lesions in my brain were causing the autonomic dysfunction and that's all i can remember.My brother just the other week experienced his hands turning blue, he's got chronic peripheral neuropathy (he's also a walking advertisement for type 2 diabetes weirdly with out a dx of diabetes) but when it actually happened, at the same time his heart rate went mental for the first time. His doc said his hands turning blue was from lack of oxygen, which makes sense but he'd rather it was a panic attack at seeing his hands turn blue than the hypertension dx he's been given instead...I'd definitely bring it to the attention of your doc, and if it happens again try and get a picture if you can, sometimes a picture does paint a thousand words :DCheers..........JJ",

            "answer": "That does sound strange and more than a little scary. Hopefully it is similar to what JJ has going on with her feet.For the last 10 years or so I have had a blue line on the bottom edge of my lower lip. Some days it's darker than others and no one knows what causes it. I have been frustrated that no one knows what it is but should be thankful after hearing from you and JJ that it's only my lip. :)Let us know how you make out please!Corrie",

            "answer": "Yes that is exactly how my hands were, blue but otherwise normal. I could also understand the autonomic dysfunction since your feet are the furthest from your heart. But blue hands make no sense if no other part of your body is also blue. I did check that out as I wa Au natural at the time getting ready to take a shower.I did mention this to my new PC today and she came up with vascular spams as why my hands turned blue. But I don't think I tend to believe that as she didn't seem very smart.She had asked me what I did in the service and I told her I worked on missiles and she responded \"Did they have those back then?\" Missiles have been around since about 1940 and a lot longer if you include dumb fire rockets (1300's) in the class.I guess when I get back from Maine this fall I'll have to fire her and get another PC. I had a very hard time understanding what she was saying due to strong Indian accent. She was asking me about my 3x bass pass surgery and she kept asking which YEAR it was done, but it kept sounding like she was asking which \"EAR\". What does a heart surgery have to do with \"EARS\"? LOL! It wasn't until she changed how she was asking the question that I finally figured that one out.Dennis",

    "question": "About a week or so ago when in the bathroom I noticed that both of my hands were blue. Not a bruise or anything like that., but blue. They were still warm to the touch and had good pulses in both. This lasted until I went to bed several hours later, but they were normal color the next morning. I know some people on here have mentioned purple feet and am wondering if this was the same thing only in my hands.I have a PC appointment tomorrow and am wondering if I should mention this to the doc or not since it has not occurred again since then.Dennis",
