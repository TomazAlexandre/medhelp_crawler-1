            "answer": "You shouldn't wait because what if something were to happen to your baby because you didn't follow the doctors orders. I'm sure they can get you for negligence or child endangerment. Just because he asked you to go to labor & delivery doesn't mean that they'll induce you, it's to keep an eye on your blood pressure and make sure everything is fine with your baby. In a matter like this you should put babies safety and health first, I would in this case",

            "answer": "Its just a baby shower. Because you have gestational diabetes and your blood pressure went up that can cause serious problems for you and baby. They wouldn't just induce you without monitoring you first. If they do induce or give you a c section its for the best of the baby just remember that.",

            "answer": "It's best to go in , it might be frustrating and scary to think about a csection but I've had two and will be having my 3rd in September. I'm also narrow , extremely narrow to the point I can' never have a nature birth. My body will not allow it. The doctor was doing his job and just wanting to inform you of a possible csection. As well as wanting you to be checked out because of your blood pressure regardless if it was just you freaking out. Your baby depends on you & no they cannot go after you for child neglect or anything like that because you refused something. Everyone has the right to refuse something , but with the diabetes I would get checked regardless of anything. Just breathe , stay calm and go to the hospital to be checked. Your baby shower isn't all that important , and if you have to have your baby you can easily make it a welcome baby party :) think positive momma!",

            "answer": "your blood pressure being to high isnt safe fir the baby, his or her body cant handle it!thats EXACTLY why i just had my babyboy at 37+4i had it all planned out too, natural vaginal birth my baby shower was planned right before i was due aswellas soon as they told me that my blood pressure fluctuating like it was, was putting too mich stress on him everything changed, my plan wasnt as important as his safty.more than likely what will happen is youll go to l&d and they will monitor you and baby for about an hour, if your bp is fine they will send you home. hospital have standards they have to go by, most wont allow you to be induced before 40 weeks unless it is deemed medically necessary",

    "question": "I had a doctors appointment last Friday and my doctor was on vacation and he won't be back until the 24th my due date is the 26th my baby boy weighs 8lbvs due to gestational diabetes so this other doctor I seen checked my cervix and told me its narrow and that I might have to have a c section I got emotional and cried and my blood pressure went up some so he sent me to get a ultrasound everything was perfect then he told me he wanted me to go to labor and delivery due to my blood pressure being high I asked him if I could go outside to cool off and come back because I just needed to calm down from my emotions of the thought of a c section he said no so I left and they won't let me make a regular appointment unless I go to l&d due to what he said and my doctor being out he just want to induce me and I don't want to be induce I want to wait until my water break or until my baby is ready my mom had my sister naturally and she was 9 lbvs I feel if it was about my blood pressure they should let me make a regular doctors appointment.",
