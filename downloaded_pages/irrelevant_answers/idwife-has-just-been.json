    "question": "So as you know, I'm being induced on Saturday with my second baby.because I have gestational diabetes both pregnancies I have had to be induced on due date. I called midwife yesterday and asked if she could give me a sweep. I needed to ask permission from my consultant. Well she has just been and Ugh crap news. She could only just do.the sweep.. my cervix is thick and far back and I'm only 1cm at most. :'( she said If i am still like this when I go in on sat it will take a while.to.induce me. (Took 3 days with my daughter) Also the baby is back to back! So.it couldn't have gone worse :( the only way it could've have been worse would be if I was completely closed and she couldn't do the sweep. I'm gutted. I was convinced I was dilating because I was getting a LOT of pains and pressure but clearly not.. I'd love to go overdue that's not the issue. I do NOT want to be induced again because of my experience last time. Hey I'd rather go naturally at 42 weeks...but looks like ill end up induced :'( please hope for me that before Saturday this baby stops being a monkey and starts to come on his own. In the mean time its lots of sex, pineapple and lying on all fours encouraging him to turn. So disheartened.",
