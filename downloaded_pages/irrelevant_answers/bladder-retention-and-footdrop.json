            "answer": "Hi I too was diagnosed of having a neurogenic bladder for which I use intermittant catherization. I have also been diagnosed as having HNPP. This has caused me loss of sensation and strenght in hands and legs. I also have a left footdrop that I have had since 1999 an as of two days ago I lost sensation in my right leg below the knee.It makes walking very interesting as I cannot control both feet and trip over my own feet.I suggest that you mention the possibility of three conditions. HNPP (heridiatry neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies). CMT (Charcot Marie Tooth syndrome)Both of these conditions have simmilar results in damaging the meylin sheet of the peripheral nerves. They are not completely sure if there might be come involvement in the central nervous system as well. Currently I'm also experiencing troubles with breathing due to diaphram involvement as well as other symnptoms that point to the central nervous system as a source of the problems.I would also have them check you for MS or even diabetes, both can involve the nervous system.I use an AFO on my left foot to help me pick up my toes when I walk. AFO stands for\u00a0\u00a0ankle foot orthosis. When I'm in situations where there are crowds, I use my wheelchair.I would encourage you to walk since further deterioration to you foot will result from not using it. Use a wheelchair as a last resort.HNPP and CMT can be determined through blood work but might also require a nerve biopsy. Resist the nerve biopsy as they take nerve from your foot. This will result in a permanent numbness in the foot. You will eventually get used to it, but it will always feel strange. At times it can make your foot\u00a0\u00a0feel wet even when your foot is dry.Please look at the following links:www.hnpp.orghttp://www.med.wayne.edu/neurology/clin_programs/Labs/CMT/CMT.htmlI sincerely hope that it is something different, but if not there are ways to deal with it.God bless,Ron",

            "answer": "Ps. MS can also be aquired and does not need to be hereditary. I have a good friend with MS. Eventhough he is younger he has less symptoms then what I have.Both my son and daughter have HNPP as well. My son has it worse then my daughter.Good luck,Ron",
