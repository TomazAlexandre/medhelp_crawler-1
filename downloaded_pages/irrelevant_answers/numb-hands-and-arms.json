            "answer": "The only thing I've heard of that can cause this is carpal tunnel (I think that is how it's spelled). It can cause pain and or numbness I'm pretty sure. Also diabetes can cause a tingling sensation in hands and feet. Hmm... that is an unusual one and I don't blame you at all for being worried. Go to webmd.com and type in your symptoms, that is what I always do.\u00a0\u00a0I would definitely go to the doctor if it didn't get better quick. Good luck",

    "question": "I'm 20 yrs old and for the past two weeks on and off my finger tips go numb just today has it gone up my entire arm all day. it feels like its asleep but without the pain just tingly I'm very scared its a horrible feeling. i have not had any injury or reason i can think of that would cause this. i just spent 3 hours in the ER and was told that everything seems fine! something is wrong it seems like water makes it feel worse nothing makes it feel better. only medications i take are birth control i don't drink or use any drugs i do smoke cigarette's though but have for 5 years i know birth control and smoking aren't a good combo but i really feel something is wrong! what could cause this? please any ideas",
