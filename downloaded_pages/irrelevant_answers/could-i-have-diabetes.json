            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Ketones and proteins in the urine can result from many factors, like excessive exercise, dehydration, high protein diet, kidney problems, and diabetes. Diabetes in the initial stages does not produce glucose in urine. However neither will it bring about ketones and proteins in the urine at an early stage. These are generally the signs of uncontrolled diabetes. You need to check the blood sugar fasting (8-12 hours) and two hours after a proper meal.Maybe you should explore other causes\u2014like dieting, drinking less water during the day, exercising a lot, eating a high protein diet. If none of these are true for you, then you must insist on a blood glucose examination and maybe a glucose challenge test. It could be either diabetes or high insulin that is causing problems. Another possibility is thyroid problems.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi, I am a sixteen year old girl, 5'4 and weigh in the high 90's.\u00a0\u00a0I am unsure about what I have, but I can tell you that when I tested my blood sugar, after fasting (14 hours), it was about 124, but then I realized the test strips were expired. I went to the doctor and the found a high amount of protein in my urine, and also ketones, but no sugar in. (I was tested about two hours after a large meal too, so the ketones were not out of starvation, and I do not exercise.) They have always seen protein in my urine also. At times though, I can tell my blood sugar goes down a lot, because I get very shaky, and at other times when my blood sugar is not low, I sometime black out for a second, get very dizzy, and faint.\u00a0\u00a0I also have excessive night sweats, and minor inner ear pain.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure what to think any more. Any help would be great!P.S: We just found out I am also lactose intolerant.",
