            "answer": "Hi!The first thing to be ruled out is recurrence of hemorrhage, and whether the depression in skull has worsened. It can recur in old brain injuries. Loss of balance can be also due to inner ear problem, Meniere\u2019s disease, diabetes with peripheral sensory neuropathy, Parkinson\u2019s disease, affect of certain medications, past head injuries, loss of foot\u2019s perceptions and sensibilities, Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), joint weakness etc.Even if you have no pain in the ear or apparent infection, wax in the ear, internal ear infection or labrynthitis can cause balance problems. Postural hypotension or BP falling with change of posture is another cause. Cervical spondylosis (or pinched cervical nerves due to any cause), mini strokes, MS, high blood pressure, tumors or injury to cerebellum of the brain, syncopal attacks, severe anemia, and thyroid disorders are some of the causes for loss of balance.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your neurologist/PCP to run tests and examination to clinch a diagnosis.Take care!",
