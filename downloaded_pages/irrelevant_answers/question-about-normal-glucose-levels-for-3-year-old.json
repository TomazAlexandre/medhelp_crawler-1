            "answer": "Hi Phoebe,Your daughter's results are not normal.\u00a0\u00a0Normal children blood sugar levels are in the range of 60 - 90 (or so).Please take your daughter to the doctor asap.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds like she has type 1 diabetes and needs to be on insulin.This is quite urgent as her condition could deteriorate quickly and become life threatening. Ie. This is a possible MEDICAL EMERGENCY.If your daughter is lethargic or appears unwell, out of it, please go to the nearest emergency room immediately.You are going to be busy for a while sorting this out.\u00a0\u00a0However, when you have time I would like to direct you to some information that will be very useful for you in learning to optimally manage your daughter's condition.1. If she has diabetes, it will be difficult to manage her blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Thus it will be very important to manage the amounts and types of carbs that she eats.2. Get this book:\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Richard Bernstein: Diabetes Solutions.\u00a0\u00a0He has more than 40 years working as a dr and has developed a system of management that will help your daughter achieve normal blood sugars.3. You may go to U-Tube and look up Bernstein Diabetes University.\u00a0\u00a0There are more than 200 lectures about diabetes management.\u00a0\u00a0Look about the one for parents who have newly diagnosed children.4. There is a facebook group called typeonegrit.\u00a0\u00a0These are all parents with kids with type 1 and helping them manage their diabetes using the methods taught by Dr. Bernstein.\u00a0\u00a0They will be an excellent resource.Please reply to this message.\u00a0\u00a0I want to be sure that you are acting on your daughter's condition and that she is ok.\u00a0\u00a0I may be able to provide you with more information as necessary.Please ask questions.",
