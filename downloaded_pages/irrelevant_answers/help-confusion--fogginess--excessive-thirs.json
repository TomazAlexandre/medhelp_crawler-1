    "question": "I am a 22 year old female and have been experiencing symptoms for about 2-3 months. I have spells of dizziness, inability to concentrate, and become extremely foggy. It feels like gravy is being poured over my brain. These spells may last all day or only for a few hours, usually in the middle of the day. They are now lasting all day. I also have an extremely dry mouth and excessive thirst all the time. My tongue has grooves on the sides. I urinate frequently, but I feel that I have had that problem for quite some time. The symptoms continue to get worse and worse and I can barely make it through a full day of work. During these spells I also experience sweating, irritability and overall weakness. I also often feel very anxious and tired. I finally made an appointment with a doctor, but I won't be in for 2 weeks. Any thoughts on what might be the problem? Thanks for your help!!",
