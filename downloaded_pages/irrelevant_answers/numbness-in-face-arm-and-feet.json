            "answer": "The numbness affects both cheeks lips and sometimes my tongue also both feet. The numbness can last for a day or two at a time then goes away for a few then starts back up. The anxiety attacks are random they happen at any time. Sometimes they happen at home when I'm just relaxing and watching t.v. they've even happened at the supermarket. Not currently under too much pressure i have a 8 month old daughter who can cause some stress. My diet is fairly healthy although i do enjoy junk food on occasion.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Common cold, sinusitis, ear infection, sensory nerve compression, peripheral neuropathy as in diabetes, inflamed wisdom tooth, impacted wisdom tooth etc\u00a0\u00a0can all cause facial numbness and pain. This is for localized numbness in the face. This numbness can also\u00a0\u00a0spread to arm depending on the severity.Numbness of your feet can be due to spinal nerve compression of lumbar spinal nerves.

Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
