            "answer": "Have you taken him to get checked by the Dr. since his last illness? If they rule that he is fine, then it might be more psychological.(in his head)\u00a0\u00a0What I have been giving my son (who is now 8 yrs old) when he's not eating like he should. I would supplement w/ not only his multivitamin, but also Pediasure, & V-8 Fusion along w/ other healthy foods to make sure he's still getting his main nutrition. Then I would make a list of the healthy foods that he does like. & only have that available in the house.(thankfully, my son likes variety)\u00a0\u00a0Also I would cut out the candy/sweets & junk food. until he is willing to eat the healthy stuff. Then only have the candy & junk foods for specially occasions. It's not up to him on what he can eat. You're still the parent. He will eat when he's hungry.You're not starving him. You just have the healthy foods that he can eat available. I wouldn't feel good either if all I ate was junk food. good luck w/ that. The most important thing to do is observe him. is he still active?? does he change when he thinks no one is watching him?? just some extra thoughts.",
