            "answer": "The mayo clinic Pregnancy book a nurse friend loaned me says your pre pregnancy weight was a healthy BMI and you should gain 25-35 pounds over the whole pregnancy. Most of the weight should be gained 2nd and 3rd trimester. I think 1-1.5 lbs/ week is the goal for 2nd and 3rd trimester. You actually don't need to eat any more food than normal during the 1st trimester, and only about 300 extra calories per day after that.",

    "question": "Hello everyone, today at 11weeks I had a check up and the nurse said I've gained a lot of weight and even had me go back to the scale to re-check. I'm 5'11 and started at 156 pounds (on a thin side) and now I'm 167 which is more but I've been 165 not pregnant before when I ate more on daily basis. My breasts increased a cup or 2 already and I have a small belly ( normally I have a flat belly). I still fit in my pre-pregnancy jeans but it's getting uncomfortable around waist.I wouldn't be worried but the nurse made it sound like it was A LOT of weight gain. Please, let me know your thoughts. Thank you.",
