            "answer": "Hi there!Well, without a detailed clinical evaluation it would be difficult to determine the cause of the symptoms. Possible causes that may need to be considered include increased emotional stress/ anxiety, GU infections/ inflammations, hormonal/ endocrine issues, neuro-muscular causes, autonomic disturbances, medication side effect etc. I would suggest considering an evaluation by a primary care physician initially and depending on the cause diagnosed/ suspected, this can be managed accordingly or specialist care may be sought.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",

    "question": "Hi folks,I have a puzzling case.\u00a0\u00a08 y.o. healthy male child.\u00a0\u00a0Had normal urinary habits.\u00a0\u00a0Has now had several months of fairly abrupt onset urinary frequency, which translates into urge to urinate every 1/2 to 1 to 2 hours, and even includes occasional nocturia x1 which beforehand did not occur.\u00a0\u00a0No dysuria, no hematuria, no genital exam findings, no abuse hx, no signs/sx nor risk factors for UTI, Diabetes, STD, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Child thriving in every other way including psychological.\u00a0\u00a0Only history which is of questionable accuracy in child of this age is that while playing rough with friends (basketball collision, kids tumbled to ground) he received a blow in the area of mons pubis.\u00a0\u00a0On exam there is in fact an area of skin round appx 1 cm diameter with slight discoloration which really could represent a healing blow to the skin, although whether this has to do with the case remains unclear.\u00a0\u00a0Eval at primary care office included completely normal dipstick urinalysis.What's the differential?\u00a0\u00a0What's the next step?\u00a0\u00a0Peds urology evaluations are very hard to access in our rural location, so the more that can be done in PCP setting the better.Best,--JSt",
