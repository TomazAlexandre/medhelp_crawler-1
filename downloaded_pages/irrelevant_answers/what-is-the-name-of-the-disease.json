            "answer": "I am not a Dr. and this is a total guess given its impossible to be sure what your Dr was referring too, but with the small description you provided in your post -\u00a0\u00a0of loss of balance, memory loss and short steps when walking, could it be parkinsons disease?\u00a0\u00a0Parkinsons is not normally associated directly with stroke or diabetes though, but I guess they can occur together (or not), if that makes sense.Another thought would be peripheral artery disease (PAD), which would potentially make more sense given your history of a mild stroke.Not sure if those suggestions help at all.Fiona",

    "question": "I had a mild stroke 2 yrs. ago and discovered that I was diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0During a Dr visit soon after, I told my Dr that I was worried about the next one now that my body knows how to have a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0He said that they were treating me to prevent that next one from happening but said that he was worried about ''something' disease' (another word + the word 'disease') and I can't remember what he said the name was.\u00a0\u00a0I remember looking it up on the internet at the time and some of the symptoms were short-term memory loss, loss of balance and short steps when walking.\u00a0\u00a0Do you know what he was referring to?\u00a0\u00a0He has since left his practice and is working at one of the hospitals recruiting Dr's as internists for the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0His replacement (recommended by him) has no idea what he was talking about (real promising).\u00a0\u00a0Can you tell me what he was referring to?\u00a0\u00a0I will remember it if I hear it or see it.",
