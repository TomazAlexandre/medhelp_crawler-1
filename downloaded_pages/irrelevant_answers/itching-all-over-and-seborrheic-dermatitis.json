    "question": "I've been having itchiness all over my body from scalp to toe(no rash), some yellowish flakes are found around my nose, mouth, eyebrow even in my ears and there's faint reddish sign around my nose and lips. I used to have dry skin for almost 1 week during the period of my nervous breakdown and seems going back to normal.I'm been under lot of anxiety and stress doubting that these could be HIV related as I did have some exposure early last month. Upon did some blood test for a few times all came back as negative and many people told me its not related too.Would anyone shed some light on this, any advises will be much appreciated.",
