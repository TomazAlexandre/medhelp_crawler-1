            "answer": "Why would you want your liver enzymes to be \"normal\"? There is no benefit to your health even if you could. They are just indicators of what is going on in your body.AST and to a lesser account ALT are result of the virus's attacking your liver. As long as you have chronic hep your liver will continue to be damaged. But this is a very slow process. It usually takes many decades for the virus to destroy the liver if ever. Since you are stage 1 your probably have 20-30 before your liver become scarred and will begin to fail to function properly.Moreover, the precise levels of these enzymes do not correlate with the extent of liver damage or your future outlook. Thus, the exact levels of AST and ALT cannot be used to determine the degree of liver disease or predict the future. These liver enzymes do not give an indication of the function of the liver. Sometimes they are mistakenly referred to as liver function tests or LFTs, but it is a misnomer.Please educate yourself on this disease so you can focus on what is really important. Like waiting for the new meds that will be on market hopefully next year. You have decades to find a cure. So need to panic and start worrying about blood levels that have nothing to do with curing yourself of this virus.hectorsfhectorsf",
