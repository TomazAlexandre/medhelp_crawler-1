            "answer": "I would talk to your doctor about the blood pressure issue; most likely it is unrelated to your pre-diabetes. High blood sugar can produce various unpleasant feelings, though usually it is not felt until over 200. Most of us find symptoms of low blood sugar a lot stronger, so you might test when you experience those symptoms to see if you are low. 170 is too high 2 hours after lunch. You want to stay under 140 so you might need to reduce your intake of carbs. If you aren't able to keep from spiking like that with reduced carbs, exercise and weight loss if needed, you might want to talk to your doctor about some meds. But do talk to him about your blood pressure concerns.",
