            "answer": "Our son was drinking a ton of water for a few days, his breath smelt almost sweet, and he was urinating alot. So I took him to the doctor and we were told that those symtoms were due to high blood sugar. At this point in time his blood sugar level was at 600, after receiving an IV of saline it went down to 300 (which is not great, but better). The next morning we took him to specialist, and he was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes.",

    "question": "my 1yr old had neonatal hypoglyciemia due to hyperinsulinsim when he was born, aparently this is quite rare, and he would most likely grow out of it. i havent needed to test his bloodsugars for a while but lately when he is playing his sweat smells like vinegar and his urine is strong and he drinks so much water. sometimes he is really hard to focus and i wonder is these are signs of low or high blood sugars?",
