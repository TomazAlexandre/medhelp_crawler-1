    "question": "Ok I know that a lot of women post about contractions as ftm. I am having a pain that I think \"may\" be contractions. I keep having a pain that is literally in my vagina but further up like in my cervix area. I feel like my son's head is putting a lot of pressure on my bladder but then the pain is really really sharp and stabby like. It has been going on for about 30 min and it isn't time consistent at the moment. I am sorry if it seems like a dumb questuon but I am 39+3 and have no idea if it is contractions or not.",
