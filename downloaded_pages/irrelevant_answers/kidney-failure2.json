            "answer": "Hi,Would you know what your current EGFR is? There are stages of renal insufficiency. An EGFR of less than 15 warrants dialysis. In your case, would you know what stage your EGFR falls?For predialysis patients, \"the diet is restricted to two major nutrients: protein and phosphorus. Restrictions in sodium, potassium, fluid and calories are based on individual needs. Because of restriction in certain foods, the diet is deficient in calcium, iron, Vitamin B12 and zinc. The diet aims to reduce the workload of the diseased kidney by reducing the urea, uric acid, creatinine and electrolytes (that must be excreted) and postpone the need for dialysis.\"\"Salt intake should be limited to about 1000 to 3000 mg/day which is about 1 teaspoon of salt a day. Cholesterol intake should be limited to 300 mg/day or less. Non nutritive sweeteners may be used in moderation and also aim for about 20 g/day or more of dietary fiber. Take only moderate amounts of alcohol. Vitamins and minerals are not necessary. Also for those with renal problems, all fresh vegetables are allowed. Avoid pickled vegetables and canned or frozen vegetables. For fruits, avoid candied fruits and dried fruits. Also, avoid commercially prepared desserts, snack chips and instant noodles.\"Source:Ong,WT,Ong,AR et al.Expanded Medicine Bluebook.2nd edition.pp 244-46.I also suggest that you ask for a referral to a nutritionist who will be able to help you with this.",
