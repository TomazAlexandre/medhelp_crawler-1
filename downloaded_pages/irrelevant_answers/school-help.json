Call the school's district office and find out who the 504 Plan Coordinator is.2. Type a letter requesting a 504 plan meeting.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you say that you include something along these lines somewhere in your letter.......I understand we need to go through the eligibility process; however, I would like to also write the 504 plan at this meeting which will include a comprehensive health care plan, therefore the appropriate personnel needs to be in attendance.3. Make sure you CC the following:US Dept of EducationOffice of Civil RightsYour state's Dept. of Education(Mail this letter to the depts. above, as well as your school's disctrict office to the attention of the 504 Plan Coordinator - his or her name)(Before mailing these, get a letter from your son's endocrinologist stating what your son needs while at school or type it yourself and request the doc's signature - he or she can revise it where needed)At your 504 Plan Meeting bring with you the signed letter from your son's endocrinologist.I understand that your son is in middle school whereas mine is in 5th grade, but I have made a One Page Instruction Sheet that gives basics on what to do based on Blood Sugar readingsUnder 80 do thisBetween 80 & such and such do thisOver 250 do thisIn addition, I have made a one page sheet that tells some symptoms my son might experience when low and high and explains the immediate need for something with sugar in it when he is low and that low blood sugar left untreated can cause convulsions, loss of consciousness and death.\u00a0\u00a0This sheet also has a photo of my son on it.\u00a0\u00a0I have made sure this is given to anyone employed by the school or volunteers who might come in comtact with my son.\u00a0\u00a0Lunch staff, yard duties, etc.Promise to stay in school?\u00a0\u00a0As if he asked for this disease and wants to get out of school.\u00a0\u00a0They do not know how high / low blood sugar makes your son feel.\u00a0\u00a0My sis also has type 1, so last yr. when I had a meeting with the nurse & principal because of a problem, I brought my sis with me, so they could hear an adult's perspective because sometimes people discredit (is that a word?) children /teens.You can submit a form reiterating the info. about the school by going to that page - the link I gave in my earlier post and possibly we can get hooked up one on one because I volunteer there, as well.They let him wander around?\u00a0\u00a0They obviously do not understand the severity of low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0You need a 504 Plan.",

            "answer": "Where do I start.We do have a 504 plan( it worked beautifully in elementary school) that states they are not to let him go anywhere by himeself when he is low. They told me last year it is not possible for them to know where every student is at any given moment? SCARY! I did go to the principal then the superintent of our district and you know what he said to me.. You'll have to excuse me I don't know much about this diabetes stuff . He had plenty of time to prepare for our meeting. I have meet with the 504 coordinator as well, he was at all those meetings( NO HELP). He is securely in the pocket of the district . As for the nurse she is only there one day a week and I told the VP I would rather she had no contact with my son. They didn't even think what she said was neccesarily a bad thing ugh! He has 6 teachers this year and one said to me the other day that he will be over this party soon and that will be good,when he is regular? what the $%#@& does that mean? Educated ,I think not! They treat me like I don't know what the heck I am doing , \" all the other diabetic we have had in the school don't seem to have all these highs/lows. I swear some of his flucuation is because he knows No one there has a clue and if there is a big problem he's #%&$#$@( up a creek with no paddle). He carries a cell phone,gluometer,carbs. I feel like I am always fighting up hill with this district. Who can I get to come to my next 504 so I can rely to them the importance of his 504 and this disease. I just sent his teachers and VP this.I got this from JDRF I beleive. I just want them to take this\u00a0\u00a0serious.ABOUT DIABETESforTeachers and School PersonnelofDante Rucker2005/2006Dante Rucker is different than other diabetics you may know. He ison a regimen of Intensive Insulin Therapy and uses Insulin Pump.Please take the time to read this information. Therapeutic strategiesfor diabetes are changing rapidly and it is important that individualssupervising young people afflicted with diabetes be aware of thenature of the disease, the treatment as well as the problems that canoccur on a daily basis. Some of the material covered is technical;however, I have tried to present it in a non-technical fashion. Muchof the information presented is applicable to other children (andadults) with diabetes.What is an Insulin Pump?An Insulin Pump is a miniaturized version of thedevice you see in hospital movies attached to a pole those meters bagsof \"liquid stuff\" into the patient's I.V. An Insulin Pump contains alarge syringe filled with insulin, a computer that allows the user totime and adjust the administration of insulin to their bodies, and asmall motor to drive the syringe. Attached to the end of the syringeis a sterile tube (infusion line) fitted with a needle which isinserted into the soft tissue of the lower abdomen. The entire fluidsystem (needle, infusion line, and syringe) must be changed every fewdays to maintain a sterile environment and avoid infection at theinfusion site on the abdomen.Diabetes Explained: Dante suffers from Insulin DependentDiabetes Mellitus (IDDM) also known as Type 1 Diabetes or JuvenileDiabetes. IDDM is an AUTOIMMUNE disease that destroys the cells inthe pancreas that produce the hormone insulin which is required tometabolize glucose (blood sugar) and provide energy for cells in thebody. People afflicted with IDDM produce no insulin whatsoever.Approximately one million people in the United States suffer fromIDDM. Dante will be afflictedwith this disease until there is a cure. Another 10 to 12 million peoplesuffer from Type 2 (adultonset) diabetes where the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin.Type 2 diabetes is a 'different' disease with symptoms andcomplications that are similar to Type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabeticscan sometimes control their disease with diet alone or with the helpof oral medications.Short TermProblems Associated with DiabetesHIGH BLOOD SUGAR Without insulin the body cannot use glucose andshifts from metabolizing carbohydrate (glucose) to metabolizing fatfor energy. This shift is accompanied by elevated blood sugar levels(hyperglycemia) and normal, acidic by-products of fat metabolismknown as ketones. When fat isthe main energy source, ketonesaccumulate and move the body's electrolyte balance into the acidicrange, causing excessive urination and dehydration as the body triesto reestablish its acid balance by excreting the ketones. This lifethreatening condition is known as diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). Totalinterruption of insulin to a person with IDDM can result in DKA within4 to 8 hours.Regular blood sugar testing can detect elevated bloodsugar levels and the onset of DKA and timely action can be taken toprevent problems from occurring.LOW BLOOD SUGAR Without an adequate supply of carbohydrate tosupport immediate metabolic requirements, a diabetic may experiencelow blood sugar (hypoglycemia). The symptoms of mild low blood sugarmay include among other things; tremors, tingling, palpitations,sweating, anxiety, shivering, dizziness, confusion headache, speechimpairment, drowsiness, weakness, hunger, and blurred vision. Severelow blood sugar is associated with impaired cognitive function thatresults directly from brain glucose deprivation and may lead tounresponsiveness, coma, or seizure. The changes mentioned above maygo unnoticed by a casual observer,however, the person experiencinglow blood sugar can usually recognize and treat the symptoms withoutoutside help. Because symptoms of low blood sugar can rapidlyprogress from moderate to severe if untreated, a person experiencingthese symptoms should not be left alone until action is taken and hisblood sugar levels are raised.Known Long Term Problems Associated with Diabetesand Long Term Elevated Blood Sugar LevelsDiabetic Retinopathy the deterioration anddestruction of small bloodvessels in the retina leadingto loss of vision. Theleading cause of blindness inthe United StatesProteinuria and elevated levels of proteinNephropathy in the bloodstreamdamaging the kidneys andother organs. The leadingcause of kidney failure inthe United States.Neuropathy damage to the nervous systemresulting in the loss ofsensation in the skin andextremities. Combined withthe effects ofperipheralvascular complications, theleading cause of amputationsin the UnitedStates.Cardiovascular and damage to capillaries,Peripheral Vascular increased risk of stroke,Complications ischemic heart death, andother microvascularcomplications.Any or all of these complications may appear in as little as fiveyears if blood sugar levels are not maintained at near normal levels.Example: a 20 year old Diabetic has just undergoneeye surgery to forestall damage to her retinas (both of them)caused by Diabetic Retinopathy.Treatment of IDDMFor years, most diabetics have taken two and sometimesthree injections a day of insulin to control their bloodsugar levelsand manage their diabetes. With this level of control it is almostimpossible to maintain near normal blood sugar levels and the onset oflong term complications is inevitable. Since 1923 it has beenRecommended by endocronologists that blood sugar levels be maintained asclose to normal as possible. It was not until 1993, however, that it wasunequivocally demonstrated by the conclusion of the 10-yearDiabetes Control and Complications Trial (DCCT) thatintensive bloodsugar management can dramatically reduce the risks and complicationsof diabetes. The trial consisted of 9000 patient years of observationof one group of patients on intensive insulin therapy and anothergroup using the conventional 2 to 3 shots a day. The results of thetrial demonstrated for the intensive therapy group a 76 percentreduction in the risk of development of retinopathy, a 54%reductionin incidence of nephropathy (kidney disease), a 60% reduction inIncidence of neuropathy, a 34% reduction in the development of highcholesterol, and a 41% reduction in the risk for heart attack andstroke.The intensive therapy group used two methods to control their bloodsugar levels:1) Multiple Daily Injections (MDI) consisting of threeor more injections of insulin combined with regulartesting of their blood glucose levels;2) and Continuous Subcutaneous Insulin Infusion (CSII ormore simply - new technology in the form of an InsulinPump) combined with regular blood glucose testing.\"Intensive Therapy\" is just now emerging onto the clinical scene withthe publishing in 1994 of the results from the DCCT.Example: When a friend went to diabetes camp in 1994 there were300 kids and 30 to 40 counselors. Only one counselor had anInsulinPump. The summer of 1995 the camp participants counted 3 pumpers (onecounselor, the friend and one other kid).Conventional insulin therapy practiced by most diabetics requirestesting blood sugar 5 or 6 times a day and the periodic injectionof a long and a short acting insulin. Meals and exercise must becarefully controlled and timed tomatch their body's insulin uptakeand energy needs. The most noticeable element of this type ofmanagement is the periodic snacks required to maintain adequate bloodsugar levels.Insulin Pump users test their blood sugar 4 to 8 times a day andprogram their Insulin Pump to provide a continuous small drip ofinsulin that matches their body's background (fasting)insulinrequirements (this is called the \"Basal Rate\"). In addition, pumpersprogram their pumps as needed to provide the exact amount of insulinto match the food they eat at the time that it is consumed (this iscalled a \"Bolus\"). The management effect of an Insulin Pump can beapproximated by using MDI (multiple daily injections) and frequentblood sugar testing, however, MDI to achieve intensive therapy ismuchmore rigorous and difficult to maintain (especially for a kid).What's Normal Blood sugar levels for a non-diabetic fall in the 80 to120 range. Glycosylated hemoglobin levels ( a measure of average bloodsugar levels over a three month period) for a non-diabetic averagearound 5%. For a diabetic, consistently maintaining near normal bloodsugarlevels of 170 or below on a day-in day-out basis will produce aGlycosylated hemoglobin level of around 7% and a reduced incidence ofcomplications as demonstrated by the DCCT. At Dante's last check up hishba1c was 7.1 (very good). In the course of a day, a Diabetic in \"goodcontrol\" may have blood sugar levels that swing from 50 to almost 200 withthe teenage years this is almost impossible. The body's blood sugarservomechanism does not work and is replaced by machines; i.e., aGlucometer, Insulin Pump, and the brain of the patient to close the servoloop in real time. Blood sugar control for a diabetic is analogous tosteering a car on a Winding road from the back seat with two long rubberbands attached to the steering wheel whilewatching the road through the wrong end of a telescope.What does this mean for you as a teacher or office staff??? Now thatyou've read all about what can go wrong, what happens on a day to daybasis? Usually everything works OK and Dante takes care ofproblems that develop. Diabetics need the people around them tosimply beaware that they may suffer from low blood sugar and needassistance to correct a SEVERE low blood sugar or simply your patienceand indulgence until they can correct a MILD low blood sugar. On theaverage, diabetics suffer a reaction which requires the assistance ofothers a couple of times a year or less. However, not to getcomplacent, moderate low blood sugars can and often do occur on adaily basis. Diabetics on intensive therapyon the average suffer 50%more low blood sugar reactions. Dante suffers 2 to 5 mildreactions a week which he has always caught and corrected himself.Someday this will not be the case and that is why the people aroundhim must constantly be vigilant in the event that he needs yourassistance.ABOUT your childname Dante RuckerDOB: 3/18/1993Address 432 Briggs ctPARENTS: Desmond & ChristineHOME PHONE791-5901WORK PHONE 622-3700/521-3601DOCTORS Dr. Maney 783-7109HOSPITAL UC Davisafter hoursIf Dante is in need of medical treatment it is IMPORTANT thatthe medical team be aware that she is an \"Insulin Dependent Diabetic\".It is common practice for emergency rooms to give patients fluids andglucose which is not necessarily a good idea for diabetics.YOU Dante can usually tell when he/she is LOW and willNEED test and correct blood sugar levels as neededTO however, if he appears shaky or upset when thereKNOW is no apparent good reason ASK IF HE/SHE IS LOWTHIS AND ENCOURAGE HIM/HER TO TEST BLOOD SUGAR LEVELS. IF YOUSUSPECT LOW BLOOD SUGAR, DO NOT LEAVE HIM/HER BY ALONE ORALLOW HIM/HER TO GO OFF ALONE WITHOUTACCOMPANIMENT.Physical exercise is not appropriate when Dante's blood sugarlevels are below 80 or above 150. He can correct a low blood sugarin 10 to 20 minutes using fast acting carbs but should have foodcontaining carbohydrate for long term correction. High blood sugarscan be aggravated by exercise and may take several hours afteraninsulin infusion to return to acceptable levels.Dante can usually correct high blood sugar levels inanticipation of a meal within an hour using an accelerated bolus.However, if he/she uses an accelerated bolus to lower blood sugar levelsthere is an increased risk for low blood sugar, he MUST eat withinthe appropriate time frame to avoid a subsequent severe low bloodsugar level and insulinreaction.EMERGENCY TREATMENTIn the event Dante experiences a severe insulin reaction (lowblood sugar), he carries in his pack the following items.1) 20 grams of carbohydrates take 20 grams of fast actingcarbohydrates( fruit snack, juice- heneeds sugar) Have him call home after hehas walked to office with a buddy. Hecan eat two or three snacks if he islow . Makesure his tester comes to theoffice with him. Make sure the officeknows he is low and waiting for me. Heshould never walk alone when low.3) Cell Phone Call 911 Call 911 and notify responding team thathe is a diabetic on a pump then callparents.Sports and ExercisePhysical activity increases the body's need forglucose and lowers blood glucose levels (as long as there is adequateinsulin). Most ordinary exercise that is not strenuous or prolongeddoes not require any particular action on the part of the diabeticperson. Prolonged physical activity such as marathon runs, or otheractivities that extend more than an hour, AND PARTICULARLY Running,require the intake of additional energy (glucose). Danteburns an extra 10 grams of carbohydrate an hour while swimming. Youmay see Dante munching on a cracker or other snack before orduring exercise. This is normal.Thank you for taking the time to read this and help Dante. Please feel freeto contact me if you have any questions.Sincerely,Desmond and Christine Rucker",

            "answer": "When my daughter was in the 2nd grade, the school board, in their infinite wisdom, was ready to pass a policy stating that no child could test or take injections or otherwise medicate on the school grounds.\u00a0\u00a0This included asthmatic patients with inhalers.I went to the school board meeting with fire in my heart.\u00a0\u00a0I was terrified after hearing the 6th grade teachers talk about dragging one of the diabetic students to the office and forcing her to drink a glass of orange juice without testing her first.\u00a0\u00a0The girl had been crying all the way to the office that she did not need orange juice.\u00a0\u00a0How traumatic!\u00a0\u00a0And how potentially life threatening!Our school board chairman was an attorney.\u00a0\u00a0I was very pointed that if they ever drug my daughter to the office and forced OJ down her when she did not need it, and threw her into a coma, I would own their school district.Their next suggestion was that before any child could medicate, their pediatrician had to be called each time.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter's pede had 35 diabetics in his practice.\u00a0\u00a0It was not feasible to call the doctor every day something came up.I had no problem with a plan and encouraged them to set one up for all kids needing medications.\u00a0\u00a0Denying medications to the child was frightening as well as exposed the school district to as much legal liability as giving the meds would do.We kept a diabetic kit in the school office.\u00a0\u00a0We had no school nurse, but the secretary would supervise my daughter's testing when needed and would follow the instructions I had made up for them each year.Schools CAN do things differently.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes they just need to hear from a determined parent to see the light.",
