            "answer": "Hello,Thyroid and diabetes are two different conditions, though thyroid being off can affect cholesterol levels and make blood sugar control harder.Is your thyroid being treated?\u00a0\u00a0Ideally the doctor will monitor fT3 and FT4 and adjust your throid meds so your levels are at least mid-range.Sorry to say that the GD with the baby is no longer affecting your sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Your fasting really is on the high side (truly normal is about 84) and yes, low carb eating, weight control and exercise should help a lot.However, you should monitor regularly (get a home meter) as there is a possibility that this is autoimmune type diabetes (adult onset type 1), as you are also having thyroid problems.Fasting levels are ideally in the mid-80s (target), and 2 hours post eating ideally less than 120 (and best if they are below 100).Let us know how you go.",

            "answer": "Having had GD does put you at risk of developing diabetes.Knowing that you do have pre diabetes now, allows you,\u00a0\u00a0through diet and exercise, to delay the onset of Type 2 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0 Type 2 diabetes is when the pancreas still produces insulin but your body is not able to use it properly.Ask your doctor to refer you to a diabetic dietician.The types of food that are better are the complex carbs which release energy slowly.\u00a0\u00a0These are whole grain foods.\u00a0\u00a0Simple carbs are those foods that are processed like white bread, cakes, biscuits, sweets.",

    "question": "I was told I'm pre diabetic that if I get some weight off and exercise. I could stop this in its tracks. I had GD with baby year ago. Could I still be messed up from having gestational diabetes? Could diabetes cause thyroid to be off or other day around. Told thyroid is borderline high I'm falling apart at 38.",
