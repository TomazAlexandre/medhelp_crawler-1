            "answer": "Hi theophage, how are you? Relax! The normal body temperature is 36.8 \u00b0C \u00b10.7 \u00b0C, or 98.2 \u00b0F \u00b11.3 \u00b0F. It is normal, where slight increase in temperature seen after meals, exercise, peak summer time, ill ventilated and congested room and so. If you have raised temperature with sweating on and off, it is better you consult your doctor for physical examination and necessary investigations. Take plenty of water and try to avoid too many spicy foods. Take Ocid every day and antacid gel as needed. Tight clothing or bedding can also cause discomfort. Share your thoughts and update on doctor visit. Take care.",

Are you still continuing to feel the same increased body warmth? Did you have your thyroid function test done? Continue to avoid hot, spicy meals and alcohol. Do drink a lot of water. Do update on your progress and doctor advice. Take care and share your thoughts.",

    "question": "Hi, me and my fiance have been living together for a number of months now and quite frequently she has to separate herself from me in the bed because my body is producing so much heat it is uncomfortable for her to the point that she ends up sweating and waking up all the time during the night.\u00a0\u00a0I usually don't experience any problem sleeping during these times, in fact only rarely do I feel hot in bed and usually leaving one leg out from under the covers is enough for me, but on occasion I too will wake up sweaty.\u00a0\u00a0I've read up on this as much as possible, but most issues that people have been experiencing don't sound like the same thing I have been. during the day my body temp is normal, when I've taken my temp in the past its more often been under 98.6 so this only seems to be happening when I sleep.\u00a0\u00a0any ideas?",
