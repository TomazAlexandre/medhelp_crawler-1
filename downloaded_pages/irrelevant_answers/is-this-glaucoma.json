            "answer": "This is a lesson to all diabetics. You should be under the care of an Eye MD ophthalmologist and you should see that ophthalmologist yearly. Do not wait like cateyes99 did till you have advanced proliferative retinopathy and an eye full of blood.Diabetes is a serious disease that can and does blind, kill, cripple and disable people. Take it seriously. Keep your weight down, exercise, eat right. Keep your blood pressure and cholesterol under control. DO NOT SMOKE. Keep your hemoglobin A1c definetly under 7 and ideally under 6. See your MD physician regularly generally no less than once every six months, more often if things are not well controlled.AND REPEAT ALL DIABETICS NEED TO BE\u00a0\u00a0UNDER THE CARE OF AN OPHTHALMOLOGIST EYE MD. ALL MEDICAL INSURANCE COVERS EYE MD VISITS JUST LIKE YOUR REGULAR PHYSICIAN.Good luck cateyes99.JCH MD",

            "answer": "Thanks Dr JCH.This was indeed a very hard lesson I learnt.\u00a0\u00a0What's upsetting is how nonchallant my first eye doctor was about the situation.\u00a0\u00a0I saw him in 2006 and he was very casual.\u00a0\u00a0He examined my eyes 3 times and on that third look he said he saw something like blood/blood vessels but I shouldn't worry because they were very tiny but when they get bigger, he'll just use a laser on them.I wasn't told at that time that what he saw growing could cause me my sight.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, he didn't tell me the name of it.\u00a0\u00a0He made it seem minute and unimportant.\u00a0\u00a0My mistake, I guess, was not caring about the blood and blood vessels because he didn't draw attention to how serious it was and is.\u00a0\u00a0I was under the impression that Glaucoma was the only cause of blindness in diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0My medical doctor never once mentioned Diabetic Retinopathy to me either, it was always about protecting my kidneys and heart in the long run; maybe it's my age.Well, now I know and knowing is half the battle and may I say that since this happened to me at a relatively young age, I've allerted my diabetic relatives and friends to go get checked out immediately.",

    "question": "I'm diabetic and 28 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I went out thursday the 23rd and the sun hit me square in both eyes but my left eye was the only one that got very blurry.\u00a0\u00a0It gets sore at times; also I see little black lines when looking out and I have scattered blind spots when reading fine print or looking out at a distance.\u00a0\u00a0If I use eye drops in both eyes, the left one always stings more.\u00a0\u00a0Before my left eye got extremely blurry, the peripheral view was warped and it seemed like a lot of light was shining in it.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks if advance for your answers.",
