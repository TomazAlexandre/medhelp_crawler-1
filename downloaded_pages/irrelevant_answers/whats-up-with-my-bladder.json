            "answer": "I have the same problem but I'm only 23! I have seen a urologist and he gave me DetrolLA that seems to work - a little. I did the procedure with the scope up into the bladder as well (wasn't as bad as I expected) but it found nothing, on paper I'm completely healthy but I know I've seen a huge change in my urination route in the last few months, so much so, I'm considering a job change. My job doesn't allow you to just get up and leave as you wish.",

    "question": "I am 32 old male, in good health. About 2 weeks ago I got frequent urination for about 1 week\u00a0\u00a0where I was going about every hr. Then it stopped and now I go on regular pattern but have a full feeling in my bladder even after I go. Feels like I have to go a couple time to feel like I emptied my bladder, then a little dribble afterwords. Primary care did blood and urine sample-CLEAN, and there is no burning when I go. Waiting to see urologist. Problem sounds like prostrate but arent I to young for that?? This has got me worried, especially after reading all the problems these guys are having on this websight. How common is it for someone to have problem like this and successfully treat it? As these guys seem like they can find no help. How common is it for guys to get some horrible disease like IC? Was drinking alot of caffiene drinks at gym and what not and visit to chiroprator seems to have helped a little.",
