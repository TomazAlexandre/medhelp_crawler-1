            "answer": "It's not entirely random who get GD but if you google risk factors for GD, you'll see that there are people who are more prone to getting GD. For instance, age, weight, family history and ethnicity are just a few of the factors that put some women at higher risk of getting GD than others. I was insulin dependant with my last baby and as soon as I delivered, my sugars went back to normal. Good luck and don't stress. There's nothing you can do.",

            "answer": "One thing a nurse told me to do is try and be very careful about your carb intake the day before the test.\u00a0\u00a0It will give you a more accurate test.\u00a0\u00a0I had for my 1st pg but not for my 2nd--and soon as I delivered my sugar was fine and is still fine to this day this is 4 years later.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of times if you are diabetic with pg--a balanced diet will control it for you--but yes don't stress if you have it you have it and nothing can be done--you will have3 the one hour test done first and then if your don't pass they will have you go to the lab and do a three hour glucose test and see if you have it then.",

    "question": "Hi all: In a week 1/2, I have the std GD test (I'll be about 26w4days).\u00a0\u00a0My OB said there's really nothing I can do to prevent getting GD, so to relax, take the test and let the results dictate what we do next, but I think she's just trying to say it's too late for me to do anything about it now if I end of having it.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know why I would have it, because I have no idea what causes it - she only explained what it is.\u00a0\u00a0I am a small-framed person, but I've gained significant weight so far in this pg (significant to me - apparently not to anyone else-though when I compare myself to others, I sound like a heifer).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, my OB said that she's seen small, healthy people who exercise all the time have GD, so it's a tad unexplained beyond genetics why people get GD.\u00a0\u00a0Can anyone out there let me know what they know on GD?\u00a0\u00a0I'm nervous about having it.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't exercised really much this pg (way too tired before and after work), I eat OK (sometimes not the highest of nutrition value foods, but my OB said that's ok, too), and I'm just a little worrried about it.\u00a0\u00a0I worry about everything!!!\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",
