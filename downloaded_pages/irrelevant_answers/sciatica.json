The nerve involved appears to be originating from Sciatic nerve.This peripheral nerve pathology can be due to Diabetes, Prediabetes, Vitamin deficiency, altered blood pressure status, any nutritional deficiency or abnormal endocrine status.I think you should consult orthopaedician, and neurologist to evaluate your case.MRI scan is most important diagnostic tool in your case.Bye.",
