I was not taking anything for the heartburn when I started on the Harvoni as I did not want to take a chance of lessening the effects of it. After a couple of weeks, the heartburn got really bad and I was really having some problems. I was instructed to take 20mg Omeprozole (Prilosec), and not more than that daily at the same time (morning) as the Harvoni on an empty stomach. After a day I was feeling much better and a week later, I feel great! The best news is after\u00a0\u00a0fighting this HCV beast for years, virus not detected!",

I also have bouts of acid reflux and my DRs. for what I call the cure took me off Prilosec and said it was ok for me to take Pepcid in the 10 mg 2x a day. But I also have nervous stomach and the only thing that helps me with that is the ginger, I get the candied form and chew it real well it has done wonders for me, even helps like the tums stuff. The first time I tried the ginger it seemed very potent but now I'm use to that part of it. I carry some with me at all times now.",

            "answer": "Hi I suggest you may want to start a new question especially as I tkink you may have many.Harvoni is the new med approved by the FDA October 2014 to treat hepatitis c Genotype 1a. It is one pill a day for most and taken for eith 8 or 12 or 24 weeks depending on the patients prior treatment history and if they have liver cirrhosis or not. I don't know it is approved I Brunei where you live.I also see from your prior post you have genotype 3 so Harvoni is not for your genotype. The treatment for your genotype that you would most probably be prescribed is Sofosbuvir (U.S. trade name Sovaldi) 400 mg and weight based Ribaririn either 1000 mg (less than 75 kg body weight) or 1200 mg (more than 75 kg)This treatment would be taken for 24 weeks and is the current recommended treatment for genotype 3Good luckLynn",
