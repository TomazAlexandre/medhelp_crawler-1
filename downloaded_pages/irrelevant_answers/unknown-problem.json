            "answer": "There are no doctors on this forum, only patients like yourself assisting other patients with our volunteered time and advice. Diabetes body odor has a sweet smell, somewhat fruity smell, and nothing like what you've described. When the body produces a foul smelling odor resembling rotten eggs, it is a sign of liver problems or disease. You need to see a doctor and get thoroughly checked before it worsens into a life threatening state. CBC [complete blood check], liver panel tests, and test for hepatitis a, b, and c are good starting points. Good luck.",
