            "answer": "You don't say what your surgery was for, and if you were give IV's before, during, and after surgery. Usually IV's contain some type of sugars. This can raise your blood sugar dramatically.If you have any concerns about diabetes, it is a simple blood test. With it in your family, you are slightly more prone to developing diabetes. Have you had children? Did you have gestatinal diabetes? Or ever diagnosed with hypoglycemia? These are all pre-cursors to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You should discuss this with your PCP at your next visit, or call and ask about it if you are worried. Good luck.",
