            "answer": "I'm sorry you have this stress.Based on what the echocardiogram test showed, your heart is fairly normal except for the EF level. Have you had a nuclear stress test?\u00a0\u00a0If that showed no blockages, I'm wondering if the low EF rating means you are de-conditioned from the Mono.\u00a0\u00a0Do you exercise regularly?\u00a0\u00a0Is Diabetes an issue with you?The EF level changes.\u00a0\u00a0I'd exercise, eat a heart healthy diet, lose weight if you need to, and in six months you might find your EF level normal.\u00a0\u00a0The word 'mild' should be very comforting to you.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us informed, best wishes",

No Diabetes.Normal cholesterol level.\u00a0\u00a0I am hypothyroid tho, taking medication for that, fatigue and muscle pain is an issue for me. So I try to exercise but cant do it regularly.So this is reversible?? my cardio said it will stay the same for the rest of my life, if not get worse. The EF level can also be considered moderate ?",

    "question": "I got my results back today for the echocardiogram.Reading is as follows:Left Ventricle: There is a mild global hypokinesis, EF 35 - 40 % and Mitral Diastolic tracing is normal.Mitral Valve: There is mild mitral valve leaflet thickening and here is trace mitral reflow.Pulminic Valve: there is moderate pulmonic insufficinecy.everything else states normal.Interpretation: Normal LV chamber size with mild LV dysfunction ( EF 35 - 40% )no evidence of vulvar heart disease.I am 28 years old. have had major life stress in the past which is better now. Had severe mononucleosis 2 years ago.According to the cardiologist, I have nothing to worry about \"ever\". is he right? he ordered a MUGA and told me to do the echo in 6 months again. Other than that, he said there is no treatment for it and everything is fine. Please provide your insight.",
