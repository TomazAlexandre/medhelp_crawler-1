            "answer": "Hi!Since NPH is a slow developing hydrocephalus, it I possible not to feel the pressure symptoms. The ventricle size may be normal in initial stage, but not a time when a diagnosis of NPH is made.To me, your symptoms appear to be due to diabetes insipidus. There is increased uncontrolled urination, dehydration (increased blood sodium) and potassium loss which could contribute to the brain fog and cognitive problems. Diagnosis is by fluid deprivation test, presence of high sodium and low potassium in blood and very dilute urine. Please discuss this possibility with your doctor. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",

    "question": "For many years, I've had a ton of neurological symptoms, the most concerning of which are my cognitive difficulties, as well as issues with being able to hold my urine and having to pee as often as every 15 minutes. Doctors have provided no answers for me; they basically just told me I was crazy and making it all up in my head. As if I can make up the fact that I have to pee nonstop and have wet myself on several occasions.I've already been screened for diabetes, MS, brain tumors, heart problems, Lyme disease, and thyroid conditions. Everything has come back normal.The other night, I was watching a Second Opinion: Mystery Diagnosis episode and feel as though I may have had a bit of a lightbulb moment. The woman on the show have very similar issues as me (difficulty finding words, memory loss, lack of concentration, balance issues, trouble focusing eyes, etc.) in addition to wetting her pants. Turns out that neurological symptoms in combination with urinary incontinence are textbook with NPH.The possibility is also intriguing to me since I have for many, many years said that it often feels as though there is literally fluid moving around in my brain and the pressure can intensify when I get into certain positions (such as bending forward at a yoga class) or when I'm at higher elevations (such as on top of a parking garage). I wonder if the reason I feel this fluid sensation is that there's some issue going on with my CSF fluid.The thing is, I have already had a CT scan and two MRIs. No one has ever said it looked as though my ventricles were enlarged. I looked at the images myself as well, and it doesn't look like they're enlarged to me either. Does anyone know if it's possible to have NPH or another issue with your CSF without it being visible on a brain scan?",
