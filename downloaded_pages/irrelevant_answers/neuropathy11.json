That is also a problem caused by hypothyroidism.In the meantime, check out vt b6 and use for nerve pain.I had the surgery for the release. They should do a release on the top of the foot, along the inner aspect of the heel and the lateral part of your calf.weight loss would be very beneficial to relieve some of the pressure as well.",

    "question": "Is there cure? Or a way to bring it under control? The doctor ran a series of tests: doppler, blood work,nerve testing, etc. He said \"Neuropathy w/ unknown diagnosis\" Put me on\u00a0\u00a0very low dosage of Gabamtin (sic) and Hydroxyotin (sic)Then told me to get tested for diabetes in six months.\u00a0\u00a0My feet, especially left foot -- numb, cold painful toes, pain in the balls of both feet.\u00a0\u00a0It feels like it is starting to affect my hands. If not curable, is there a program to follow in order to live with it? Does it get worse? Can it subside? Physical therapy? massages? I teach high school and have\u00a0\u00a0to go to work in two months. Gotta get this under control. If it helps I am 5'2\" and 190 lbs. (yes, obsese) Would weight loss help it go away or get better? Pls offer me something, I am so scared that I might die from this.Thank you,dlcobbThis discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/290187\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/290187</a>.",
