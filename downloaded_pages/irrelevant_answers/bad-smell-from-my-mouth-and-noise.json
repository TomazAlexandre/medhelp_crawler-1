            "answer": "The reasons for a strange smell in mouth or nose are so many, that seeing a regular family doc would your best bet, especially since it can sometimes mean something serious, altho mostly it's just regular sorts of things like needing to visit a dentist.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes CAN cause an odor, generally it is a sweet smell, altho it can smell like other things.\u00a0\u00a0First thing I thought of was perhaps acid reflux, it can cause a bad odor when acid builds up in the tummy and bubbles up into the esophogus, so if your tummy or esophogus hurts, you can try drinking an Original Alka Seltzer, and since you take pills, always drink a whole glass of water with them to prevent acid.",

            "answer": "Well, as I said, the reasons for a bad odor in the mouth and nose are VERY involved, and so I think since your family doc hasn't been too much help, it's time you should be referred to a gastroenterologist OR an ear nose throat ENT specialist, to do more investigations as to what might be doing this!",
