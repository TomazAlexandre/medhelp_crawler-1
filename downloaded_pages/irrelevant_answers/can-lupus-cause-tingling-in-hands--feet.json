            "answer": "Yes, my ANA is 1:640 (speckled pattern).\u00a0\u00a0I have terrible joint pain and body aches.\u00a0\u00a0I was early staged with the cancer and there are no signs of recurrence, but I realize this is also a possibility.\u00a0\u00a0I sure hope not, but I don't want lupus either.\u00a0\u00a0I have had the mouth ulcers, the ANA, sed rate and CRP.\u00a0\u00a0But, I do not have the other antibodies (Anti-Sm, etc) and my total complement (CH50) is very high instead of being low which is ususal for lupus.\u00a0\u00a0 I am waiting for follow-up with my doctor, but am trying to figure out what is happening because I feel so terrible.\u00a0\u00a0I hurt all the time and feel like I constantly have the flu.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have any rash except my feet are red on the bottoms and the redness cups up around the heel with a marked red line.\u00a0\u00a0I have tried antifungals to no avail and the doctor doesn't think it is athletes feet.\u00a0\u00a0Again, I have to wait for follow-up of that too.\u00a0\u00a0Other than that, I do not have any skin issues.\u00a0\u00a0 It seems like I can conclusively say I have three of the criteria for a lupus dx, but the high complement level is making me think it might be something else.In my tests, my fasting glucose was in the normal range, but a more senstive test (Hemoglobin AIC) showed that I have a slight elevation which technically qualifies as prediabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It is the first time I have had an abnormality in this area (glucose) and I have had regular fasting labs due to my cancer.\u00a0\u00a0So, it seems unusual to me that I would have this severe of tingling due to the very early prediabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But, perhaps I have had it longer than I think.Any thoughts of what could be the cause of the high complement level or these symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks for your comments!Shelly",

            "answer": "I also have numbness and tingling in the lower extremities(no glucose issues)and it has been determined to be neuropathy related to SLE which my rheumy tells me is common.I have also started to have issues on one side of the face with a feeling very similar to how you feel after having the shots at the dentist office and they begin to wear off but feeling isnt totally back 100%.It is called parenthesia.I have been referred to a neuro just for a double check after going to the ER because it freaked me out after happening 2 days in a row and was moving upward on my face.No sinus or ear issues-xrays of sinus normal-no TIA or stroke-so got the parenthesia diagnosis and a go to the neuro :) When I got home I of course read up on it and it can be caused by autoimmune illnesses.So I am glad I went and got some of the testing out of the way but will make a neuro appt too.I find alot of times alot gets blamed on SLE and it most certainly can cause alot of issues but I wanted to be certain no one was missing the horses by looking for zebras so to speak :):).Just because I have SLE dont automatically assume that it all falls under that category and miss something else that can be going on healthwise.I hope you get some solid answers soon.Good luck.",

            "answer": "I know they might be cautious about putting you on plaquinel or steroids because of the cancer.\u00a0\u00a0It would make sense that they would not want to suppress your immune system.I did some looking to see what all \"can\" make ANA be elevated.640 is significant.\u00a0\u00a0Anything 160 or greater is considered highly suggestive of connective tissue disease.Speckled pattern is the most common and least specificCan indicate: SLE, MCTD, Scleroderma, and or Sjogren's syndromeSome medications can make the ANA be elevated.\u00a0\u00a0(Please do some research on that to see if you are on any of those meds.)Infections and cancer can cause the ANA to be elevated in low titers.\u00a0\u00a0Usually when the infection or drug use is corrected, the ANA goes back to normal.A word about comp levels.\u00a0\u00a0They are only low when the disease is affecting the kidneys.\u00a0\u00a0If they are not, then the levels would be in the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0The disease waxes and wanes.\u00a0\u00a0So it's not something that is always found in lupus patients.",
