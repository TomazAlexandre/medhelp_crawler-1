            "answer": "What was your TSH?FTs are Free T-4 and Free T-3.\u00a0\u00a0Ts are Total T-4 and Total T-3.If you are estrogen whether\u00a0\u00a0natural or meds. , FTs are the best\u00a0\u00a0test, because estrogen interferes with the Ts but does not interfere with the FTs. So you might not be getting the best analogy with the T-4 test.With that said, your T-4 suggest hypo, not hyper.\u00a0\u00a0Actually the TSH tells this best and T-4 comfirms.But hard to tell what is going on without knowing all three test, TSH and both FTs, for they relate what your thyroid status actually is. Then other test might be done to confirm.If your TSH is going up with the Meth. the T-4 will or should go in the opposite direction, which will\u00a0\u00a0bring your T-4 lower, and with a low T-4\u00a0\u00a0tells something else is going on. Normally nodules don't have an effect on thyroid levels unless it is a hyper-functioning nodule, in which case meds are not going to effect levels because the hyper-functioning nodule has control. Alsohyper-functioning nodule is just that, levels will be on the hyper side of the issue. Where your T-4 is not.If you go to a specialist - endo., make sure the doctor treats many thyroid patients a year.\u00a0\u00a0Many specialize in diabetes and know less about thyroid.Yes, at first it is confusing, but keep reading and researching your condition so that you will have knowledge and\u00a0\u00a0an informed input with your treatment.Good Luck.Just my personal opinion and/or experience.

            "answer": "I have an appointment today to discuss my test scores. I think I'm going to ask her to defer me to a specialist. Because I do believe that I need a second opinion. And you know, my smpytoms are much closer to hypo than hyper.\u00a0\u00a0So yea, alot of research and information is going to help.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your support!",
