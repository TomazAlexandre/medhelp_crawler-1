            "answer": "An interesting post but I'm have trouble understanding theproblem. Are you saying that you have anxiety if you see 2objects side by side & must move them, or 1 object that lookslike 2 side by side. If you where glasses & have trouble w/convergence, soemtimes they will grind prism into 1 lens or offset optical lens center to allow focus. Do you where bifocals?As far as the floaters, the lining of the eye simply builds asm. piece, breaks away & floats in eye fluid till it attachesto a wall. It's like a piece of jello that can be annoying.There is a trick to help floaters. I use to play tennis butmine always occured when I looked up quick to serve. Beforestarting I learned to 'jam' it to a wall by doing a quick eye excercise. Look straight ahead then quick rt or lft & back to astraight. Pick something to use a a focal point. Eventually itwill stick to wall. If large, they can actually blast them bya procedure but it isn't easy. They have to go in the eye tofind the floater. You can jam a floater to stick sometimes fordays/wks/months. It's really quite easy. Be interesting to knowwhat you were trying to previously explain.\u00a0\u00a0I have no ideawhat the prev.-post meant. I've only heard that comment when ithas to do w/ diabetes or heart condition. Maybe 222 will comeback & explain? Anyway, like to understand your problem abtobjects.",
