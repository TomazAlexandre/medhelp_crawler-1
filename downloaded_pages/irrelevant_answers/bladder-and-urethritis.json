            "answer": "You already had an appropriate reply to thiese questions. You need to work this out with your doctor. Recurrent or persistent symptoms like yours are common but never dangerous. Visit the now-closed STD expert forum and use the search function for \"chronic pelvic pain syndrome\" and/or \"CPPS\". You'll find a lot of similarities to your symptoms. In any case, herpes is never the cause of such symptoms, so this really isn't the right forum for you anyway.Good luck.",

    "question": "Hi for over 5 weeks now ive had constant urge to urinate. I went to my pcp and he did a prostate exam and blood test for diabetes, both negative. Went to urolgist did 2 std test and 3 cultures all negative. Std test were for chlamydia gonorrhea ureaplasma and some kind of Mycoplasma. Also ultrasound done on kidney and bladder, urologist said everything seemed fine. During this 5 week period i noticed a small clear disharge about 4 times. I thought it was semen, but now i believe its a discharge. Urologist said he thinks my symptoms are from the flu and the virus ecsapig the body can cause symptoms like this months down the road. So he said i was fine. Started feeling almost 100% theb the other day the urge came back, today after the shower i noticed a clear small discharge. I have no burning or pain, just bladder fullness. When i was feeling better i did masterbate a few times so my question is could i have just reaggravted this? Is this herpes? Could the flu cause this bladder pressure then constant peeing turns into urethritis? This symptoms i have now are mild but still worring me very much,\u00a0\u00a0thanks!",
