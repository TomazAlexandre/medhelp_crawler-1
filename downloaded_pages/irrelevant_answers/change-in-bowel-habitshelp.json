    "question": "Hello,First of all, let me explain everything that has been happening with my health. It all started with a bad flu and chronic stress all at once. After recovering from the flu, I started experiencing abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea, gas, itchy rectum, mucus in stool. My gastro-enterologist diagnosed me with SIBO and I was given antibiotics for 3 weeks (3 pills per day). During that time, I was also suffering from a sinus infection and chronic post nasal drip and the ENT gave me more antibiotics. However, its been a couple of months and my appetite remained the same, no change in diet, and i am losing unintentional weight, my stool is either fluffy or thin/narrow with undigested food, bloated, mild pain in lower abdomen and gas, fatigued, weak, joint ache, headache. My primary doctor conducted a physical exam, including STD's, and everything came back normal. I am really depressed because i continue to lose weight without being in a diet. I am still waiting for blood results for thyroid, diabetes, vitamin B12, vitamin D and pancreatic test which was done at the Gastro-enterologist clinic. In addition, i am scheduled for a colonoscopy. What is happening to me???? someone please help.",
