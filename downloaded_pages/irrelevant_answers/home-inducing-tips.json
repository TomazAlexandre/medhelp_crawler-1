            "answer": "Let it go on its own. The reason I say this is our daughter was in distress and if I didn't go to hospital she wouldn't be here. I was 37/4 and wanted to stay home but my water broke and I went to hospital and when I did her heart rate was dropping under 60 and stayed down for awhile come to find out my placenta had started to detach from my wall before she was born. Please don't chance your baby's life. If I wasn't in the hospital I wouldn't be holding my baby right now.",

            "answer": "My doula told me that nipple stimulation will work everytime- but not a little, like 3 hrs/day with a breast pump. I got through about 10 minutes and that was that. So painful! I got over that idea very quickly! I did end up with pitocin a few days later and same thing with placenta detaching- baby's heart rate was down to 45. Let things happen on their own, birth will be much easier if baby is ready :)",
