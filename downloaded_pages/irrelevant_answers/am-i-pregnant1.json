            "answer": "Your iron levels have nothing to do with your blood sugar. Nothing to worry about really especially since you'll talk to them tomorrow. Increasing your iron is important for sure but it's not an emergency. If there are other issues with your labs there's no way to know from what you've posted but if they only sent one script to the pharmacy it sounds like you're doing okay. They'll fill you in.",

The pancreas is what provides insulin to get rid of the glucose...\u00a0\u00a0So I wouldn't worry they aren't connected in anyway.... Sorry if it doesn't make sense I am a nursing student and tried to simplify it :) but hope it helps",

    "question": "Great. Now that i have your attention, please read.Last Monday i took the glucose test and was told if they didn't call me by Friday everything was fine. So i missed a call today from my doctor saying they wanted to go over lab results (they're closed now so I'm calling first thing in the morning). I also got a call from the pharmacy that my prescription was ready. So i called them and asked what it's for. She said iron tablets. My question is since i obviously have low iron does that mean i also have gestational diabetes as well? Or is there anyone that got the same results as me and everything is fine. I'm not too worried just kinda want a heads up on what'll be discussed in the morning as far as lab results. Thanks",
