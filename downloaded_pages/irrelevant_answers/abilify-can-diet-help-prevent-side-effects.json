            "answer": "I believe elevated blood sugar is a possible side effect, but all you can do is have your doctor monitor your blood sugar closely, as I am sure he will want to do for you.\u00a0\u00a0Healthy diet and exercise is recommended for everyone to help ward off diabetes, and especially for those with a family history -- even without taking the Abilify into consideration.\u00a0\u00a0I hope it works well for you.BTW - be careful with the lamictal, which I am also taking -- my doc says to watch out for a rash which can be very serious.Hugs,Ruby",

            "answer": "I'm on Abilify too and my pdoc said that it is a blanketed warning required by the FDA because another medication in that class caused a few pre-market study participants to have raised blood sugar levels. He said it's not anything to worry about. If you feel better having your sugar checked every couple months, have your doc write an order for bloodwork. there is 1 test they do called an AC#### I donm't know the numbers but your doc will and it tests your overall blood sugar.I also got familar with the symptoms of high blood sugar so I could watch it myself. I bet if you ask a doc on th forums you'll get the same answer.I've been with my doc 5 years and he's the best psychaitrist in Scottsdale, I know he wouldn't put me on a drug that could cause me harm. I wouldn't worry about i too much. I do have a family history of diabetes too.Lamictal is the one you ahve to watch for Stevens-Johnson syndrome, that's why you have to start it in those packets but if you get to the highest dose with no rash, you are unlikely to have any issues.You may want to follow a diabetic diet due to familt history but it won't matter with the Ablify I'm told. It's a great drug that has really given me my life back!! I love itIt's a great drug, the first time I took it I gained water weght so I went on Geodon which made me crazy. Abilify was the only\u00a0\u00a0thing that worked but now I take it with 40 mg of lasix and I haven't gained a pound. I doubt you'll gain, it not ypical at all.Good Luck, you like the drug, it has been a lifesaver!!Erin",
