            "answer": "I was induced with my 6 year old daughter. It was my easiest labor. I got the epidural before they started inducing me, I didn't feel any pain until I was about to push and even then it was pressure in my butt. Try to get the epidural before they start the process and you'll be fine.",

But I was delighted about being induced because I actually knew I'd have the baby soon and you can be more emotionally prepared lol",

    "question": "Hey Ladies... as some of you know I was always going to be induced because of the gestational diabetes. I'm currently 36 +5, I got my induction date today which is on the 27th of this month. Which is not too bad as I'm due on the 7th of January, so the interval is reasonable. Well what I'm trying to say is i'm actually quite scared now I know I've been excited over the past months but everything is moving fast right I'm so scared. Anyone on here been induced before? How did it go? Any words of encouragement?",
