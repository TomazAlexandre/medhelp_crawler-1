            "answer": "I am a mother who just 4 months ago lost my 13 yr old daughter to type 1 diabetes. She was diagnosed at 6 yrs old. My daughter and i did everything we could to control her sugar levels. And after we found a good endocinologist who really started to get a handle on it. About a year ago she started sneaking foods she wasn't suppose to have, i tried to teach her that they were not forbidden foods but foods that she cannot have constantly. A little at a time. My daughter was on humalog and lantis, she had a slide scale so that when her sugar level was high she knew how to make up for it. She took X amount of insulin for X amount of carbohydrates. This helped alot.A year ago septemeber she went to live with her dad. That is when a lot of things changed for her. She did really well the first couple of months, but then started a downward spiral which she did not recover from.Her dad did not take her disease seriously, which affected her a lot.She felt different from all the other kids, classmates, friends family. She did not want to be different so she started not testing her sugar in front of her friends. Eating everything they did. She was only 1 of 2 kids that was diabetic in her whole shool. She felt very seperated from everyone else. It got to the point that when she was with her friends she wouldn't test her sugar or take her insulin. She ended up sick a few times.The last weekend she was alive she spent it sick. She had gone to a football game friday night and ate things with her friends she shouldn't have and then didn't take care of it. Sat.morning she had sugar levels at and above 600, she should have been taken to the hospital but wasn't. She got very sick and all she did was sleep and throw up. Sunday night her dad got home from work and gave her 15 units of humalog for a sugar level above 600. He later left and left her alone. She died that night. Her dad didn't take it seriously and she paid the greatest consiquence for it.I am telling you all this so that maybe you will see how serious this disease is. You can not think \"i'll eat this now and deal with my sugar later\", later may be to late!This disease should not be treated with punishments and rewards. You and you alone have to learn how to deal with this. You have support and that's good! But you are the one who has to deal with it. If you feel depressed seek help, professional if need be. If your having problems controlling what you eat maybe you should seek out a counselor for help.But please do not suffer in silence seek what ever help necessary. It is good that you are reaching out now, but don't stop here, do what you have to to get help. I don't know if i have said anything to help, but i wish you luck and i hope you can overcome these obstacles!",

            "answer": "Hello Atanuero,You have been given good suggestions by the volunteers here and I need to add one more.As a minor, it is very important for you to find a trusted adult that you can discuss your medical concerns with.\u00a0\u00a0You are clearly a bright & articulate young person, with very reasonable concerns.\u00a0\u00a0While parents are a natural first choice to turn to for help navigating diabetes care, if that is not possible for you, you need to find another trusted adult -- a relative, counselor, teacher, neighbor, clergy member to work with you and help you work with your doctor/medical team.Legally (as you may have read on the Terms & Conditions of this site), we are not allowed to give advice to young people age 13 or under.\u00a0\u00a0If you found good information on this site, please come back with your grownup so that we adult volunteers can have conversations with your adult.\u00a0\u00a0Take good care of you and please talk to a grownup in person that you can trust and depend upon.",

    "question": "Hello, I'm a 13 year old with diabetes since 6 and am in grade 8. For around a year and a half I've been having problems with overeating. My HBA1C is currently 13.2 and I've had an episode of Ketoacidosis about a month ago. Basically I go to school and my friends and classmates are eating candy and stuff that I know I shouldn't, and they know I'm diabetic. When they see me try to control myself, they feel sorry for my disease and give me candy and other high-carbohydrate sweets. I'm well aware of every complication and keep on top of every new event in diabetic care. I'm not on a pump because my family and I find it easier to control my blood sugar levels with injections (I have a good team to help me, a chemist and a mathematician (my grandparents)... they are possibly the biggest help anyone has and will ever offer me). But it seems that every time I leave their eyes I lose control and eat things that really aren't in my diet at all. Today I had the biggest lapse in control in months and ate half a box of cookies. We feel like we've tried everything from not letting me go to school or parties to taking away priviledges to taking me to the hospital and showing me 40-50 year olds with no legs or eyesight...help?",
