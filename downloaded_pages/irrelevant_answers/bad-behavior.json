            "answer": "I am a type 1 diabetic who was diagnosed at age 12, 35 years ago. My answer to you is going to be a mixed response, so please read carefully.First, I want to let you know that low or high glucose levels CAN affect emotions, and many parents of type 1 children notice and comment that their children are more irritable, hard to control, or emotional when glucose levels are not in good balance. The balance of chemicals in the body and brain do affect emotions. I have babysat toddlers with type 1 diabetes who would become rather wild and loud or would withdraw and seem depressed or sad when glucose levels were off-kilter. So this is true.HOWEVER, BEHAVIOR does not have to follow emotional upheaval. Many type 1 kids, myself included when I was young, do not choose to act out inappropriately when their emotions are in upheaval, and many of us also do not behave inappropriately because we feel bad. Yes, the child can be taught to express himself if he feels bad and he also can be taught to make a distinction between appropriate and inappropriate behavior. I think my parents would agree that I was a well-behaved child, even years ago when glucose control was really hard to acheive with older insulin regimens.Personally, I believe that it would be wise to have the child check his glucose levels if his behavior seems \"off\", but if the numbers are off, he should not expect people to just put up with inappropriate behavior. If he is taught that it is OK for him to express himself any way he chooses because he is diabetic, he may grow up never learning to maintain control over his behavior. If anything, excusing him this way may do more to make him feel helpless and depressed (a very common complaint among type 1 people who write in to us at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation) than working to teach him to take charge of his behavior, which is something HE can control no matter how he feels.So I do not agree with his parents that his behavior should be ignored, but I do think you need to be aware that his glucose levels may play a part in the emotions he feels. Both high and low glucose levels tend to make people edgy and irritable and sometimes irrationally depressed. So it may be necessary to not only attempt to teach him how to channel his emotions into constructive behavior, but also to adjust the glucose levels with either more insulin or quickly-digested carbohydrates in order to help him feel better.",

            "answer": "School Nurse,First I want to thank you for your work and your going these extra miles to figure out what's right for this youngster.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not a physician, but a long-time diabetic.From what you've written, my best guess is that he acts out quite simply because \"My parents don't care.\"\u00a0\u00a0His words and your experience seems to indicate that that's at least partly true.As I'm sure you've seen, kids with or without health issues YEARN for parental attention and if they don't get it on a regular basis for normal kid-life things, they can escalate bad behaviors in search of it.There do seem to be plenty of parents too busy <sigh> to be parents.\u00a0\u00a0My best recommendation is to continue to report all bad behaviors to the parents, and if needed, involve the teachers & principal in a meeting with them.\u00a0\u00a0There is something wrong with his behavior.\u00a0\u00a0It might be due \"simply\" to parental non-involvement and/or there could be underlying issues. If his behavior is escalating, it's good to intervene soon.In my opinion, diabetes complicates behavior issues, but it doesn't cause the things you describe.",

            "answer": "Hi - my daughter got diabetes when she was 6 yr old (she's now 30)-and- one of the most difficult things for me to cope with & for her to deal w/was when she got the Diabetes, it took \"her\" away...\u00a0\u00a0 she was a very different little girl personality wise...\u00a0\u00a0 It was like I had lost my little girl...\u00a0\u00a0 and for her it was extremely frustrating not feeling well/her old self & being terribly frustrated because of it all.\u00a0\u00a0 As the years went by - each real bad instance that had sufaced - I sat her down & asked her to help me understand how she's feeling & when she didn't feel good and/or was frustrated by TALKING/Communicating it by conversation when it was happening and why...\u00a0\u00a0 Not so easy to do while a child is at school - but in time, a Nurse's and/or teacher's gentle/positive efforts to communicate with the child - will eventually help that child to know what they're living with is being understood the more they talk things thru/think things out before acting in not acceptable school required behavior.\u00a0\u00a0With the deliberate/constant/sincere effort from the School Nurse and/or the Teacher's involved - the child will eventually learn that he or she can work THRU/WITH their illness's sometimes not so great side effects...\u00a0\u00a0 It also helps them to deal with just plain LIFE itself...\u00a0\u00a0 GOD bless you all for your great hearts & compassion for all children dealing with Diabetes and other illnesses",

            "answer": "My daughter was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes almost 1 year ago, when she had just turned 7.\u00a0\u00a0One of the first things we noticed was that her personality had changed radically.\u00a0\u00a0She was very clingy, and irritable, and easily frustrated.\u00a0\u00a0Over time I realized that two things were going on.\u00a0\u00a0First, she was responding to an overwhelmingly frightening event that changed everything about her life.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, she settled down, even though she is still more clingy and easily upset than she used to be.\u00a0\u00a0Secondly, I have found a direct correlation between her behavior and her blood glucose level.\u00a0\u00a0When her levels are low, she gets irritable and irrational.\u00a0\u00a0When her levels are high, she gets obstinant and weepy and depressed.\u00a0\u00a0In no way, however, do we allow her glucose levels to excuse her behavior.\u00a0\u00a0We are working with her to help her recognise when her levels are off and 1. check her sugar 2. tell me\u00a0\u00a03. adjust her sugar and 4. find an acceptable means to deal with her emotions until her levels normalize.\u00a0\u00a0We have given her permission to remove herself from a situation so she can regain her composure, and we try to gently lead her toward resolving her issues.\u00a0\u00a0The most effective thing we have found is to delay dealing with an issue until she is less emotional.\u00a0\u00a0One thing I found helpful for myself is to remember when I, or a friend, has had PMS or dealt with menopause.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to be a similar type of affect - irrationality and irritability that is difficult for the person herself to recognise.\u00a0\u00a0 Insulin is a hormone after all.\u00a0\u00a0God bless you for caring enough for your student to seek an answer.\u00a0\u00a0One thing that might help the boy is to join a group of similarly-aged children dealing with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0His parents can check with his medical team.\u00a0\u00a0I know it may seem like the parents are coddling the boy ~ they probably are, but please remember that they are dealing with a severe shock to their lives as well - their child has a life-threatening, life-altering disease that will never go away.\u00a0\u00a0Their medical team can also help them to deal with their fears and desire to protect their son.",

            "answer": "my son was diagnosed about 2 yrs ago i have 4 children. immediately i notice his behavior change\u00a0\u00a0at first i didn;t understand thought he was just acting out this was all new stuff to me never really dealt with jd type 1 as i watched him trying to figure out whys n how comes n than getting the calls from school n than punishing my son for his behavior i couldn't figure it out my son an i have a good relationship he would tell me mom i don't know why i acted like that . at this point its driving me crazy because this wasn't the same kid he was before jd type 1 to make a long story short as soon as i would notice the behavior change i would finally get him to check his blood n 9 out of 10 times he was high and than noticed the higher the less self control he had made crazy trying to make him behave n still figure out the whole diabetes thing every time he did his correction and drank water 15 20 mins later my son was fine most of time he would come and tell me sorry for whatever he had done i would say don't be sorry just dont do it again he would say mom i really dont know why i was acting that way mind you we are just having a conversation this is not him trying to talk his way out of punishment he would say i just have no control made no sense to me finally months later i learned that high blood sugars he really had no self control i'm no doctor but i would love to know if there has ever been a study on the brain whatever part of the brain the controls ones ability to have self control and if there is any change of any sort when sugars are up i would almost bet my life that it would confirm my conclusion because the sugars in your blood is the fuel that keeps you pretty much alive and functioning so any level that isnt normal affects the brains ability to function properly",

    "question": "I have a student with type 1 juvenile diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0He is in first grade and is seven years old.\u00a0\u00a0He was diagnosed a little over a year ago.\u00a0\u00a0Lately, he has had several problems with behavior here at school.\u00a0\u00a0Some is aggressiveness: hitting, pulling on people's arms, pushing, etc.\u00a0\u00a0He also has disregarded rules on the playground like climbing the fence and not lining up to go inside.\u00a0\u00a0He has been caught lying to me about symptoms of being ill, and lying to his teacher about hitting another student.\u00a0\u00a0When asked if he has been in trouble at home for the problems at school, he says that his mom and dad don't care.Mom and dad are semi-educated people. Dad happens to be trying to get into medical school.\u00a0\u00a0Their response to this problem with behavior is that he has done nothing wrong, that his sugar fluctuates and when he is high he will have behavior problems. It makes sense to me that if he's too high or too low that he may need to take a test at a different time.\u00a0\u00a0But I have never heard of blood sugar affecting behaviors like these.\u00a0\u00a0Can you please tell me about this? How should we handle this?",
