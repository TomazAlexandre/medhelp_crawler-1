            "answer": "A membrane sweep is where they stretch it to help process labour and you can go home after.and induced is where they hook you up to an IV to start your contractions and help dialateSome women may get it done 2-3 weeks before if they have diabetes, wanna try for a vbac. But most doctor's won't induce you until your over due. I was induced at 39.6 weeks but my water broke but had no contractions what do ever. So it all depends on you, your baby and the doctor",

    "question": "What's the difference between being induced, and having a membrane sweep? How many weeks do you have to be for each & what are the qualifications? It's not fair, I see women on here getting both (weeks before they're due) but my doctor won't do inducement till im way passed my due date. That agitates me.And my son is already measuring 38w so if he's too much bigger I'll be forced to have a C-cection -___-",
