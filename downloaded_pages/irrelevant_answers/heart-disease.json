            "answer": "Have they offered angioplasty? I think the RCA is ok for stenting, but the left cirumflex is less than Ideal and I think you will have more long term issues. The vessel is only 2.5mm wide and has disease over a 37mm long section. So to cover the disease, they would have to stent over 4cm and this will need 2 stents overlapping each other. Perhaps as the RCA is dominant, it will open collaterals across to the left side if stented for better flow/pressure. I would seriously discuss the Left Circumflex with your Cardiologist because I believe within just a few months it will start to block again.",

            "answer": "Medication alone will be insufficient. It take HUGE lifestyle changes to stop heart disease. You have to eat a very healthy diet, exercise regularly, not smoke, stay stress free (not easy in societies of today). I often wonder if the lifestyle changes make medication necessary if you can achieve them. I've not seen a study done on this, but it would be very interesting. Personally, I think a good healthy lifestyle would not require medication unless your heart has already become too bad.",
