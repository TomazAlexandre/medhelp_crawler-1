            "answer": "Hi there!\u00a0\u00a0As a matter of fact I do have a friend with type 1 diabetes that now has 3 healthy children.\u00a0\u00a0Her and her husband did try awhile to conceive the first time and finally turned to IVF.\u00a0\u00a0She was 36 or perhaps 37 at that time.\u00a0\u00a0She had an uneventful pregnancy and delivered a beautiful, healthy set of boy/girl twins.\u00a0\u00a0Just before those babies 1st birthday, she found herself pregnant naturally, and although were not preventing this time, they weren't really trying either.\u00a0\u00a0Quite a surprise as they had tried so long the first time.\u00a0\u00a0Just a few months ago she delivered a healthy beautiful boy, full term.\u00a0\u00a0I should add that her twins were 38 weeks at delivery, so full term as well (apparantly 38 weeks is considered full term for twins).\u00a0\u00a0She told me that at the fertility clinic where she did IVF they told her her diabetes had nothing to do with her fertility issues, and called it \"unexplained infertility\".\u00a0\u00a0I can also tell you that she has always been extremely cautious about monitoring her blood sugar, her insulin intake etc. and during her pregnancies she was even more so.I am wondering which part you are concerned about.\u00a0\u00a0If it is the diabetes, well you already have a healthy child, so you know you can do that just fine.\u00a0\u00a0Lot's of women with diabetes conceive and have healthy children, although they do monitor you more closely which is never a bad thing.\u00a0\u00a0Or is it the fact that you are 36?\u00a0\u00a0If that's the case, well, your a spring chicken around this forum...lol.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to be 41 this month and am 37 weeks pregnant with a healthy boy.\u00a0\u00a0My co-cl PamelaBee has two gorgeous healthy children and had them at 42 and 45.\u00a0\u00a0There are many many women here in their late 30's and into their mid 40's pregnant and doing great!\u00a0\u00a0It sounds to me like you are working with a positive and informed Dr.\u00a0\u00a0That is half the battle.\u00a0\u00a0I wish you luck in ttc and welcome to our community!!!",

            "answer": "I pulled this off babyhope.com...I hope it helps explain. Musinex is used in the same manner as Robitussin.Robitussin is a popular brand of cough syrup and it might be surprising to consider its relation with fertility. But the fact is that this expectorant is used to loosen and thin mucus of a different kind too, called cervical mucus, in women. Robitussin is only a specific brand and any expectorant that contains guaifenesin as the only active ingredient can be used in its place. Generic versions are most likely available as well. Be sure to carefully inspect the ingredients list to make sure the ONLY active ingredient as guaifenesin. Any other ingredients can diminish the effect you are looking for.The recommended dose for improving cervical mucus is two teaspoons (200 mg) taken orally three times per day. Recommended dosage is two teaspoons (200 mg) taken orally three times per day. If mucus still appears thick, you can take as the maximum dosage as listed on the label of the cough medicine. Water intake should be increased to encourage cervical mucus production and a full glass should take with each dose of guaifenesin.Most doctors suggest taking Robitussin five days before and including the day of ovulation for a total of 6 days during your cycle.This helps provide the optimal environment to help the sperm survive and get to where they need to go.If you take Clomid, waiting until the day after the last Clomid pill is taken before starting Robitussin is suggested.",
