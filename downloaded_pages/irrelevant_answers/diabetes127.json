            "answer": "Just take a deep breath and relax a little. Diabetes is pretty common in general and the only thing that changes really is your sugar intake. Being as sugar isn't exactly healthy anyway it's not a bad thing. I have gestational diabetes and a couple of diabetes websites have helped me stay on track with recipes and advice. Try diabetes.org they have great budget friendly recipes. And switch out sugar for splenda or sweet n low wherever you can. Everything will be okay :)",
