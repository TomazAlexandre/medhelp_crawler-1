    "question": "I have a 2.8 year old child enrolled at my center who has been fully toilet trained for at least 6 months, she has now learned to pee when placed in time out or when on her cot, or anytime she wants attention that is being given to other children.\u00a0\u00a0She is an observer, and does not play with other kids or toys, she usually sits back and watches, so time-out is not a real deterent.\u00a0\u00a0This child also has very low muscle tone and strength in her hands and legs.\u00a0\u00a0I had put in a request for an Birth to 3 evaluation, but she did not show significant enough delays the warrant help.\u00a0\u00a0In 25 years of working with children, I have never had a child that continually does this behavior, and I am not sure what to think or do.\u00a0\u00a0Any advice would be wonderful.",
