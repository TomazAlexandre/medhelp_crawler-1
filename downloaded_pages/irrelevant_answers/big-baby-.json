I'm currently 24 weeks pregnant with another girl and my scan at 19 weeks put her at 9oz\u00a0\u00a0whereas with my second at 19 weeks she weighed 10oz so I think they're pretty reliable but it also depends on the technicians experience.",

    "question": "My sister went to see a specialist today she's 24 weeks and they already think the baby is between 4-6lb :/ how accurate are they? She's having another one at 32 weeks to check the measurement again. Her last baby weighed 10lb 6oz at birth and they nearly dislocated her hips trying to get him out, his shoulders went stuck 2 years ago. I never had any scans after 20 weeks so not sure on how accurate they are after that stage. Anyone here had a first big baby, what did your second weigh? x",
