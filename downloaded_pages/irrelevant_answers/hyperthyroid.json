            "answer": "It would be unusual to be having \"hashitoxicosis\" at this point, but a Graves-like scenario of hyperthyroidism has been reported after years of Hashi/Hypothyroidism -- however these cases will have usually undectable TSH levels -- yours have been in the normal/low-normal range.\u00a0\u00a0Would continue to follow levels closely and titrate the synthroid according to labs and symptoms.",

            "answer": "If it is Graves the symptoms will sometimes come & go until either hashi's or graves wins & one becomes full blown over the other. I know how you feel. The symptoms of hypo make you feel sick, not yourself dragged out but the hyper side can be a completely different story...it not only makes you sick but so sick physically & mentally in ever aspect it's terrifying.Ask your doctor to check your Graves antibodies even if it's just for piece of mind.I hope you find some answers,TJ",

    "question": "I'm a 27 y/o male and was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes back in June 1998.\u00a0\u00a0Four years later, I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's and tested positive for antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0Went on Synthroid and had my dosage increased over the years from 75mcg up to 137mcg in October 2007.\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after my dosage increase in in Oct - around Halloween, I began experiencing sinus tachycardia, high blood pressure, anxiety, restlessness, racing thoughts, etc.\u00a0\u00a0All the symptoms of hyperthyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0Because of these episodes, I went to the emergency room 2 times that following week, as well as to my pcp, and my endo.\u00a0\u00a0My endo noticed my emergency room TSH was 0.8.\u00a0\u00a0She backed me off my synthroid dosage to 125mcg.\u00a0\u00a0I seemed to get better for about 2 months, then at the beginning of January of this year, I had another episode and again went to the ER.\u00a0\u00a0Sinus tach and high blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0My pulse would come down to the normal range but would stay in the low 90's and I had the restlessness and anxiety that came with all of this.\u00a0\u00a0I had all the test run, visited a cardiologist....did a stress test, and all was normal except my sinus tach and blood pressure.\u00a0\u00a0Again went to my endo and she noticed my TSH was now 0.4.\u00a0\u00a0She's checking my calcium and for pheos but the pheo test she ran the first time was negative.\u00a0\u00a0So now she backed me off my Synthroid to 100mcg.\u00a0\u00a0I think I'm doing a little better but still have my headaches, fatigue, can't focus/jittery eyes, blurry vision comes and goes, extreme hunger, and about 10-12lbs weight loss.My question after all of that is - Can I be experiencing a thyroid flare that results in hyperthroidism after all these years of having Hashimotos (6yrs)? My endo is skeptical but I think I should have my T3 and T4 levels checked again.\u00a0\u00a0Oh and now I'm on 25mg lopressor 2x daily to control the BP and HR.",
