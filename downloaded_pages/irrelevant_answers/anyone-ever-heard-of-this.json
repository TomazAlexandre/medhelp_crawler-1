            "answer": "whats going on with the viral load tests - are people getting them every day - cant anyone wait a month as per protocol - no wonder insurance is messed up - yes fatty liver affects liver enzymes - more importantly is can affect treatment outcome by weakening the immune response - and fatty liver can cause diabetes which further compromises the immune system - no test should be ignored especially when on treatment - some however can be taken with the grain of salt - a single high or low reading often indicates normal fluctuations - what is of concern are consistent repeated highs or lows",

    "question": "So my parnter was undetected at week 2 - but his ALT and AST levels have not dropped that much.ALT is 72 and AST is 65.\u00a0\u00a0Apparently their explanation at the liver clinic is that he also has a fatty liver - common with genotype 3 which would account for the lack of drop in ALT?\u00a0\u00a0Does this mean his chances of SVR are even less now?\u00a0\u00a0They are both lower than when he started.\u00a0\u00a0Only one injection left......but he does have stafe 3 early 4 cirrohsis",
