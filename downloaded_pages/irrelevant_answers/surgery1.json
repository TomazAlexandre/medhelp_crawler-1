            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The feeling of stretching or pain may not be due to skin. It could be due to pinched peripheral nerve from closure of craniotomy scar or due to a nerve compression either at the cervical spinal level or at the cranial nerve level. If you have diabetes or hypothyroidism, then also you can expect some peripheral neuropathy.Since this feeling is spreading all over scalp, and local causes like dermatitis, dandruff etc has been ruled out, you need to consult your neurosurgeon/neurologist and try and assess a neurological cause for this. Take care!",
