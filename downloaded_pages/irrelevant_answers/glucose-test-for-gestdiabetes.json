I would actually talk to your doctor before you immediatly start doubting his or her confidence, unless you have other reasons.When I was pregnant with DS, I failed the hour test and passed the three hour test, but I paid no attention to what the bottles said.",

            "answer": "Update on the glucose--false positive on the one-hour Diabetes test. I finally got to talk to my doctor and told her about the 100 g glucola orange pop they gave me. She said it was a misshipment from the hospital and that they are not even ALLOWED to order 100g since it's only used in in-lab testing (the 3hour GTT).\u00a0\u00a0She looked in the cupboard and they were ALL 100g so i saved a few other pregnant women from false positives too apparently. She cleared me of the diagnosis using the 3 hour chart (yippeee).Just to clarify, it wasn't my doctor I was doubting, it was the staff who hands out this stuff. She has a terrible office organizational staff (3-MD office sharing staff). BUT, she is a terrific baby person and I wouldn't trade her for the world.Anyway, my conclusion is we do have to be proactive and looking things up can be good (sometimes it makes me feel paranoid to check nuchal percentages and HCG levels and bloodsugar levels online but in the end no one will double-check for you but yourself).",

    "question": "My doctor's office ordered a screening (one hour) for diabetes. I drank the bottle they gave me (100g Glucose orange pop)\u00a0\u00a0and went for 1 blood draw. They told me 5 days later I got 170 and therefore failed.I looked up online and found the bottle should have been a 50g bottle of glucose (not 100g which is only used in the 3 hr\u00a0\u00a0GTT). Anyone ever have anything like this?\u00a0\u00a0By the online tables, a 1 hr level on 100 g has a cut-off at 180 or 190 (and so 170 would be fine). I've saved the bottle to show them but am doubting their competence at this point.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone remember their test?",
