Later my hypoglycemia may turn into type 2 diabetes but right now the doctors are calling it only hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0My glucose levels are too traveling all over the low end chart readings.\u00a0\u00a0My A1c levels have only ranged from 3.0 - 5.0 on a daily basis. I have tested with the Basic Onetouch meter and the newer Utra OneTouch meter.\u00a0\u00a0My log book says my readings should be 90 to 110 before a meal and 110 to 140 after a meal but, my reading never goes no where near those readings. My personal reading goes far below what they should be.\u00a0\u00a0So, my doctor says the readings indicate that I do not have diabetes because diabetic people have high reading on their daily blood tests.\u00a0\u00a0My brother had been diagnose with hypoglycemia and did nothing about it and it now has turned into Type 2 diabetes.",
