Because her condition is not critical you may have an extremely long wait, but I would suggest an in-person evaluation by a team of physicians would be worthwhile. They will know what questions to ask.",

            "answer": "Thank you. Yes, unfortunately due to the fact she is out of state this is not possible. I am looking into finding someone to go with her though. I was curious if she should start with a general doctor or if this sounds more like a specific type of doctor was needed. Due to her age, if this was something needing a specialist, I sure would like her to see one and not have to wait months to get in. Thank you for your comment though.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!If both the legs are red then it could be due to poor circulation or due to clots in deep veins of both legs or due to skin infection (common in diabetes) or eczema, or it may have ben there earlier too. Yes, I agree, she should be seen by a doctor. Try and arrange for another doctor to take a look. Take care!",

    "question": "Grandmother is 90 and her doctor is not doing anything to help her.About 9 days ago she bumped into her side. There is no bruise or anything but she has noticed that from her knees down her legs are completely extremely red. I know she is diabetic. She has called her doctor and the doctor will say is that its normal for blood to pool after being bumped. I am not a docor but this is crazy. She should be seen and not just ignored because of her age. I am not convinced that her bumping into something\u00a0\u00a0caused this. She lives out of state so I need information on what she should be checked for please. Its both legs from the knees down.",
