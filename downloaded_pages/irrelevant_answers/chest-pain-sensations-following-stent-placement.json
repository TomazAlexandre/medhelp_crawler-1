            "answer": "Dear sally,Your case is a perfect example of an often overlooked fact that even younger women can have coronary artery disease.\u00a0\u00a0Although you don't smoke or have other risk factors your single biggest risk factor is the diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Tight control of your sugars will help slow progression of the CAD.\u00a0\u00a0Generally ischemic pain is not continual but episodic.\u00a0\u00a0They should be ablae to control the ischemic pain with medications. You really should be on a cholesterol lowering drug. Although diet and exercise are the foundation and are important they can only go so far.\u00a0\u00a0These drugs are life saving and everyone with any type of coronary artery disease should be taking one.\u00a0\u00a0Lipitor is OK as a substitute for Zocor.",

            "answer": "I can't really comment on your chest sensations other than I've had 4 angioplasties with 5 stent installations done then eventually bypass sugery. At no time after the angios did I have discomfort.As for the medications I can understand if your medical coverage doesn't cover the cost of Zocor not wanting to go on it but I have found that after Zocor then Lipitor my cholestorol is bang on target. (with excersize and proper diet).As for the Metoprolol I went on it after surgery to slow down my heart rate and stabalize the beat and found that it also worked wonders.I didn't have any negative side effects from any medication but every one is different.Just some info to ponder, best of luckJohn",

    "question": "I had a stent placed on June 1st.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a 39 year old female with no family history, normal blood pressure, total chol 157, HDL 35, LDL 88, only about 45 pounds overweight, type II diabetes for 5 years as diagnosed between 2nd and 3rd kids, gestational diabetes for all my pregnancies, and don't smoke.So with only a couple of risk factors I was pretty taken aback by sudden chest pains, 90% blocked LAD, and a quick angiogram with stent placement.\u00a0\u00a0Cardiologists and everyone else seemed surprised at my age, and that the angiogram showed no significant coronary artery disease anywhere else.\u00a0\u00a0Was given instructions to follow a healthier diet, started an ACE inhibitor, closer monitoring of my diabetes, and advised to go exercise (no restrictions).\u00a0\u00a0Cardiologist specifically wants to raise HDL, for which I'm taking fish oil, one glass of red wine at dinner, 800 mg garlic daily, etc. plus diet and exercise.My question is that I constantly have a feeling or sensation in the same place where I had the initial chest pain.\u00a0\u00a0It's almost as if I can \"feel\" the stent.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes in the past two days I've felt a spasm type of feeling, (feels kinda like the baby kicking me in the womb), but what bothers me is that there's always a sensation there.\u00a0\u00a0Can't exactly call it pain, but just a feeling.I had a second angiogram on June 12th because I developed chest pain after exercising (just a moderate 30 min walk).\u00a0\u00a0They again pronounced me just fine, and thought the problem might be a branch artery that comes off right where the stent is - it has a 50% stenosis, but nothing they can do (too small to stent).\u00a0\u00a0So I may have to live with chest pain after exercise they said, and indeed I've had it a couple more times.\u00a0\u00a0Goes away with rest, only had to take a\u00a0\u00a0nitro once.Am wondering if the constant sensation I have in the chest is normal.Also wondering if I'm being stubborn, because I've refused to take a cholesterol lowering drug (they prescribed Zocor, not covered by my insurance, the alternate is Lipitor), and a beta-blocker Metoprolol.\u00a0\u00a0I'm opposed to anyone just throwing a bunch of drugs at me - my sister died this year at age 36 of a liver disease (alcoholic - cirrhosis) and my mother has a fatty liver (and does not drink).\u00a0\u00a0I agreed to take the ACE inhibitor since it seems to have many benefits for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0But not all the cadiologists agreed on the other two - and I feel that if there's little benefit to be gained - I'd rather try diet and exercise first.Thanks for your comments.",
