            "answer": "Samething happened to me. From about 24 weeks until 31 weeks I was measuring big. US kept showing a lot of fluid around baby. I got growth scans every 2-4 weeks to check fluid levels.I did my glucose test again to confirm if I had diabetes or not (came back normal). By 31 weeks everything was back to normal. To be on the safe side I have to do non stress test starting in 10 days just to monitor baby. I wouldn't worry to much, but definitely ask questions if you have concerns or just want some peace of mind. I have all my US done at Maternal Fetal Medicine and right after a doctor always comes in and explains things to me and answers any of my questions. Prayers everything goes back to normal for you.",
