She's mainly getting them at night now, which kinds makes me think this will be a \"middle of the night\" baby. Also, the baby isn't moving much anymore, which the doc said is a good sign that it's coming soon.She walked around yesterday at Costco. And then she went for a short walk with our other sister last night.I'm in Arizona. The hospitals here won't admit you until you're 5 cm.I didn't know you could lose the mucous plug that far before delivering. She won't be happy to hear that! ha ha!",

    "question": "My sister has already passed the mucous plug, the baby is pretty much in the cervix now, and she's 1 cm dilated (which she has been for about 3 weeks). She's been having hard contractions on and off for 2 days, and she's unble to sleep at all. Her due date isn't until the 12th, but this is her first, and we're just wondering...how much longer is it really? It seems like she will have the baby any minute now, but could it still be a week away?",
