    "question": "So I passed my 1hr glucose test,\u00a0\u00a0which I thought i would fail & I had an ultrasound because my uterus is measuring 2wks ahead.\u00a0\u00a0Baby is well measuring on track for 27wks 2lb 4oz, but my uterus measures 29. Come to find out,\u00a0\u00a0I have a lot of amniotic fluid.\u00a0\u00a0Which could be caused by a number of things... since diabetes isn't the culprit, I now need blood tests and close monitoring with ultrasounds every so weeks. I really hope its nothing serious but I read online its called polyhydramnios & it sounds scary. Anybody been through/going through this?",
