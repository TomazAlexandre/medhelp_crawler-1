            "answer": "I had it with my daughter, she's 8 now. I controlled it with diet. It was probably a good thing for me, it kept me eating right throughout my pg. I didn't have any problems and actually about 2 weeks before delivery, it corrected itself. I had a perfect 6lb 13oz baby girl. It seems bad at first, but it's really ok. The only thing I worry about is getting it later in life. You have a 50% greater chance of getting diabetes within the next 20 years I think. good luck. Feel free to send me a note if you need anything.",
