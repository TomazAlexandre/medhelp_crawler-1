If we\u00a0\u00a0can help further, please don'nt hesitate to contact us.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck.",

            "answer": "Severe headaches can be caused by swings in blood sugar and hormone changes.\u00a0\u00a0Which sounds very possible to me from what you explained. The headaches also sound like migranes, because they are severe and light sensitive.My daughter gets them from swings go highs and lows.\u00a0\u00a0I get them as I had part of my thyroid removed and when my hormone levels are off I get severe migraines.The other thing is teaching your 3-yr. old to dial 911 if anything happens to you.\u00a0\u00a0When my daughter was little her daycare taught the children to call 911 and say they need help.\u00a0\u00a0The responder can get your info usually form the 911 system such as address, they are also trained in talking to the child.\u00a0\u00a0Also speak with a neighbor to have them check on you occasionally till you get the situation under control.I hope the endo can help.\u00a0\u00a0 Please let us know how you are doing.wendy",
