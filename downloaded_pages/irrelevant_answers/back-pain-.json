            "answer": "Hi!No, it is not normal to have back pain from running. One possibility is unaccustomed exercise\u2014so increase your pace slowly. Another possibility is wrong foot wear. So change the foot wear and see and buy good quality sports shoes means for running and jogging.Other than this you could have developed a slipped disc or suffering from spondylosis which ahs worsened by constant running. This needs to be ruled out through X-rays and MRI.Anemia, low vitamin D and low vitamin B12 or peripheral neuropathy secondary to diabetes, hypothyroidism, lupus etc should also be looked into.Please consult your doctor regarding this.
