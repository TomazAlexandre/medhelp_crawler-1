What is it? I have a neck injury to c 4-7 considering surgery.",

    "question": "I have neuropathy and it is really bad in my feet and legs. I get twitches often too and pinches like in the ribs or back.One wierd symptom I get that I have not mentioned is is vibration in some part of my body. It is painless, feels like a small vibration (little motor) running in sometimes the side of my left breast, or the left side groin area and sometimes in my left lower stomach. This can last a day or a couple of days, just enough to annoy me. Is this related to neuropathy?Other symptoms I have mentioned before are pain, tingles, sharp shot pains and stabs in feet and legs, severe cramping in feet, mostly left and pains in left hip, at side back or front of hip, that feel like a threatening disslocation coming on. weaknesses in toes and feet and hands, disscoloration on outside of left ankle. SOme of the cramping has actually left me unable to walk a day or two already, when really bad.My diagnosis so far have bin diabetes, neuropathy, and as found by a physio therapist occupational functional tester,,, a curve in my back. I am 47 years old and at time of functional testing a few years ago I was told my body was acting like an 86 year old as far as strengths and abilities.The vibrations have started recently and come and go now and then.",
