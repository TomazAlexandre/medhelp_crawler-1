But dont cut out sugars completely it messes with the test. But just eat like two cookies a day. I know it seems a lot but i had to do the same thing and felt like it would completely back fire on me but i followed the diet she gave me and no problems. Eat lots of fruit and veggies as well. And good luck.",

            "answer": "With gd, if it does come back positive for the three hour test you will be making some big changes in diet. They have you focus on more protein and limit carbs bc they actually turn to glucose in your body. Exercise is also great bc it can help naturally expel glucose. But dont worry. Even if you dont pass this test and have gd it is difficult at first but you adjust.",
