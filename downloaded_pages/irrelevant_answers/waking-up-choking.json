            "answer": "The \"waking up choking\" sounds very much like gastroesophageal reflux -- the backflow of stomach contents into the esophagus that can come all the way up to the mouth and nose. When this happens, the material can be aspirated - dribble into the windpipe.Night sweats can be a sign of a number of diseases including tuberculosis, diabetes and Hodgkins but most commonly occur for unknown reasons, with no obvious associated disease.The fevers should be documented and if truly recurrent, a diagnostic workup should be done in an attempt to determine the cause, although it, along with the other symptoms and signs described, could be secondary to an autoimmune process.",

            "answer": "Myesthenia Gravis commonly is a cause of waking up with the inability to breath. I have heard that propping up your pillows so your head is not flat when you sleep can help those with Myesthenia Gravis.I think one place I read that info was at http://www.MyestheniaGravis.orgThere is also http://www.braintalk.org and there is an MG area there. You can post to others with MG.",

    "question": "I have been having episodes of waking up choking.\u00a0\u00a0They happened sporatically in the past but seem to be more frequent lately. It's like I have had something to drink and it went down the wrong way and can't catch my breath. My history is mild generalized mg, and another autoimmune process that cannot be distinguished at this time with rashes and I have had a low grade fever for almost a year.\u00a0\u00a0A month ago my knees started hurting and I developed fluid on the right knee.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the fluid on that knee I had swelling below it.\u00a0\u00a0I have also developed night sweats the past 1.5 weeks just the back of my head, neck and upper shoulders. My shirt and hair are damp when I wake up.\u00a0\u00a0Is this a sign of cancer or something?\u00a0\u00a0It is really upsetting to wake up like that.Any suggestions would be welcomed.Allison",
