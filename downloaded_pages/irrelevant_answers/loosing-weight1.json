Haven't gained any since last month, but baby is growing perfect so I guess I kinda have lost some weight, my doctor congratulated me because he said I was on the risk of getting gestational diabetes since I was a little on the overweight side, but that thankfully didn't happen, so don't worry, if the doctor doesn't say it's bad then be happy you don't have to work as hard to get back in shape!",
