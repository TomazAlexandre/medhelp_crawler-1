            "answer": "Hi Mike....u have quite a a list of symptoms. I was looking up some of the them online and won't go thru what ur dr. has already tested for. I saw something about Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) but that doesn't explain the thirst. Do u take Chinese medicine. You describe itchy face,trouble breathing sounded like allergies. CFS causes brain fog, trouble sleeping which leads to fatigue, low concentration. That being sad I would be depressed and I wouldn't be drinking, just my two cents and that's about all it's worth. Also while looking Sjogren's Disease came up..might want to look at that to but I don't think the symptoms exactly match. Wish I could be more help......good luck to you MikePeaceDebbie",

Also had a terrible brain fog, as you call it.I've changed to a low carb diet now. (Especially white bread and sugary stuff like candy/iced cream).. and within two days, I quit being tired, and the brain fog lifted...\u00a0\u00a0I feel 100% better.\u00a0\u00a0I can still eat a few carbs and continue to feel good.\u00a0\u00a0 i'm not sure about your other symptoms though.",

Was the healthiest I ever ate and even lost 15 pounds in the process... but felt no better. Very confusing but trying to stay positive and keep moving forward. Thanks for responding and I am happy you are feeling better!",

My son has it n took almost a year before dr diagnosised him.Initially I was thinking Diabetes but tests prooved otherwise.So Im stuck on presuming u may just have thyroid issues. As blood test for my nieces n I came back negative and an ultrasound was only way they found abnormalities. Unfortunately. All of us had cancer. So if u dont feel well, keep persisting and dint stop til u do !I found my diabetes n tokd dr to check. And the thyroud I insisted in ultrasound snd found cancer there.Sumptoms are scary sometimes and u need to persist the doctors etc to persist in tests til they find substantial proof of what condition u have.\u00a0\u00a0Brain fog, thin hsir, thin nails, constipation, trouble swallowing, sinus inflammation were all part of my thyca dymptoms. Thirst for me was the diabetes and thyroid.I also was active with work n school n family.Good luck and i hope you can feelBetter soon !",

            "answer": "That's some symptoms! I would have thought diabetes. However, since that has been ruled out and diet seems to work...why not try a Gluten Free diet. I was not a believer in such things until my son came a long. He has a gluten insensitivity that does not rise to the level of celiac disease. He has concentration issues consistent with ADHD, extreme bouts of agitation, extreme thirst, and inconsistent reactions to foods that can give him diarrhea/constipation. We put him on a gluten free diet, and it all vanished within a day or two. It's worth a shot while you wait for your neuro appointment.",

            "answer": "I took the liberty to copy and paste my original replies to this questionfrom the A/I forum, for (hopefully) the benefit of all, since there's more activity over here, and may lead to more discussion and who knows?\"Hey Mike,Just a couple things and I'll continue later in another post.Re: Candida testing.--Stool testing will show if your levels of yeast are within a \"normal\" range,a statistical model, which reflects an average of what is normal for many other people but may not necessarily indicate a level of yeast that is \"normal\" for your body.---Blood testing.\u00a0\u00a0Besides allergic type of reactions, anti body blood tests will not reveal other types of immune responses and consequences in other body systems outside the blood circulation, which are also possible reactions to increased candida levels.Should you indeed have candida which was not detected, 2 months of\u00a0\u00a0treatment and strict diet will not eradicate it.It takes average of 1-2 months of strict treatment per year from the onset of candida (not the symptoms, as you may be unsymptomatic for years!).Have you ruled out MTHFR gene mutation or other undermethylation issues?Please let me know. About 40% of all people have this gene defect, whichaffects them in varying degrees and ways.Did you get a homocysteine test for\u00a0\u00a0Neurological B12 (methylocobalamin)?The standard mma test for B12 does not show this.It's related to undermethylation.Polydipsia, which is excessive thirst and the resulting excessive water intake, is often caused by very high production of aldosterone ( adrenal hormone)\u00a0\u00a0and leading to very low potassium. This needs to be ruled out.An endocrinologist or Urologist would probably the type of doctor to see for this.Also Osmotic diuresis needs to be ruled out, as it is another possible cause.You may have to see a Nephrologist (kidney specialist) or Urologist for this.I'll post again more, but for now, you're welcome to reply and comment.Continued:Back to the genetic link.This has to do with methylation processes as I mentioned before-a bit too technical to get into right now in detail, but basically the result is that when you have a mutation of the MTHFR gene, the corresponding MTHFR enzyme\u00a0\u00a0works at a much lower rate and one of the many issues that result from this,\u00a0\u00a0possibly pertinent to you, in relation to your sinus issues, is that histamine produced in your body does not get broken down.And this is just of many consequences and if left untreated, serious diseases like MS or cancer can develop.There are many possible mutations but you need to be tested mainly for677 and 1298 , so you need to hook up with a knowledgeable geneticistwho can also treat you.There has been considerable research that shows one or more MTHFR mutations may play a role in cancer, stroke, heart problems, congenital defects, depression, IBS , miscarriages, migraines, chemical sensitivities, schizophrenia-like syndromes, bipolar disorder, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Alzheimer\u2019s disease and more.MTHFR Gene\u00a0\u00a0testing. One of the least expensive places for this is23andMe, which will send you back \"raw data\" which needs interpretation.No problem. If you decide for that , let me know and I can give you a couple links where you can upload the data and get the answers for free .The good news is that it is treatable (to a great extend)Should you have one of this gene's 40-50 mutations (it is actually quite common), please let us know which one.Also, underlying infectious pathogenic conditions, such as mycoplasma, babesia, ehrlichia, bartonella etc, considering your medical history, have to be ruled out, as well, as they are A/I mimickers. The good news is that these infectious conditions are treatable!Your doctors are not likely to help you with these.Just do search here under Dr. Garth Nicolson, a part time contributor in medhelp and the world's top expert in these types of infections regardingdiagnosis and treatmentThey are notoriously difficult to diagnose and to treat, leaving the majorityof sufferers undiagnosed or worse misdiagnosed as CFS,FMS and other conditions.Hope this helps, but please note that my comments and suggestions arenot intended to replace medical advice.Final installment:23andme would be the one I would go with and when you get the raw results back(no interpretation what-so-ever from 23andme, due to some FDA situation) you can go to the Genetic Genie for help regarding the analysis.Just visit their website for details. there are other ones, too, but Genetic Genie is fairly straight forward.TheNutrEval, is probably good, but not specific enough for your purposes,in regards to your suspected genetic defect(s).Keep me posted and I hope you get the answers you're looking for. \"Cheers!Niko",

    "question": "Looking for anyone who can help!Age: 26Weight: 173 lbsHeight: 5'10\"Lives in ConnecticutSymptoms:Brain fog, fatigue, lightheaded, extreme thirst, reaction to foods (inconsistent) and agitationTimeline/Description:I have had these issues for over 4 years... When I first started my job out of college, I would have random bouts with fatigue where I would have to go to my car and nap because I was so tired. As the years have gone on, this has grown more and more constant, to the point where I always have fatigue, brain fog, light-headedness and sometimes feel so \"out of it\" that I am afraid to drive.Over the past two years, I have begun experiencing excessive thirst (on top of the fatigue/fog) daily, which leads me to drink well over the recommended daily water intake.There are many times where the brain fog increases drastically following a meal but this is not always consistent. I find that when I am having a really bad day with brain fog, I am very agitated, fidgety and moody as well (not because I am not feeling well, seems more like another symptom).More and more I have been having reactions to foods/alcohol, to the point where I turn bright red, get itchy, face gets hot and I start to have a little trouble breathing which tends to go away within an hour or so. I spent over two years getting immunotherapy for external allergens, with no relief. I was also tested for food allergies but nothing came back positive.Other random issues that I have had over the past 4 years include increased sinus infections, ear aches and back drip, which never used to be issues for me.I take a multivitamin daily, vitamin b-complex and a probiotic.Doctors and Tests:I have had appointments with my primary care physician, ENT, Allergist, Naturopath, Endocrinologist and Pulmonologist. I have been tested for mono, Lyme disease, anemia, diabetes, thyroid and what seems like all of the \"go to\" tests when a doctor hears fatigue. I tested negative for diabetes and negative for all other initial endocrine system tests, with the doctor feeling confident that it was not an issue within her realm.The ENT did not see any issues with the sinuses but recommended immunotherapy. The allergist could not figure out why my two years of immunotherapy for external (dust, pollen, trees, grass) allergies did not help at all and did not believe food allergies was my issue.My Naturopath tested my B12 and other vitamin levels with no problems popping up. After her recommendation, I went on a two month anti-candida diet (cut out all yeast, sugar, alcohol, etc) as she thought it was a yeast build up in my intestines. I stayed on the strict diet for two full months and stopped once the stool tests came back negative for yeast. While I ate extremely healthy, cut out alcohol and lost 15 pounds, I felt no better than before.I am scheduled for a sleep test within the next two months but I feel that my lack of sleep quality is due to all of the issues I am having, not the other way around. Not to mention, a sleep issue doesn\u2019t seem to answer the excessive thirst problem.I am also seeing a Neurologist within the next month.I do not believe that I have depression, though I am starting to get slightly depressed seeing as these issues have gone on for so long and have been very debilitating.Who I Am:I have always been a hardworking, focused and career oriented individual who loves being around people and making others laugh. Over the past four years, I have slowly turned into someone who can barely focus on simple tasks (brain fog), has put his entire career on hold hoping to find a cure (too afraid to start a new job as I can barely focus) and someone who has not been his normal self. These issues have become more and more debilitating; to the point where my entire life has revolved around how I can just get back to feeling like my old self (I can't even remember what that is like anymore). I go to bed every night praying I will just wake up and feel better, only to wake up and immediately be hit with fogginess and fatigue. I am not a depressed or suicidal person, but I honestly don't know what I'd do if I looked back in 6 months and still felt this way and/or had no clear direction on how to find a cure.Thank you so much in advance for your help!",
