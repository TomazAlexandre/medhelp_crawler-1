Please encourage him to read and learn as much as he can about his diabetes. I'm assuming he is Type 1? His life will definitely change from this moment on but that doesn't mean he can't do all the things he wants to in life! I also encourage him to find communities of other young Type 1's that he can talk to, online or in real life.",

            "answer": "Hi,I'm sorry your brother was diagnosed but let him know that he can still live a normal life with some adjustments. I've seen alot of teens think their life is over when they get it, but if they control it they can do anything anyone else can do. There are also support groups and other kids that are diabetic. If you are in California I can give you the number of other parents with kids with diabeties.As for your sister, yes she should get tested as well. Please let me know if you need any help with any questions, I have had juvenile diabeties for 31 years, so i've been through it all. I've had my good days and many bad days. It's part of life.",
