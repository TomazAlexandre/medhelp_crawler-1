    "question": "Drug myself out of bed after 5 hours of something similar to sleep to take the 3 hour glucose test only to be sent home because my sugar was too high to do it because I ate a yogurt. Well I was told at my last appt to eat before because I wouldn't be able to eat or drink during the test, which I knew that. I normally don't eat in the morning because I'm just not interested but I did this time just do I wouldn't feel sick from not eating, but I guess I'm supposed to have that feeling because I'm not supposed to eat :/ so now I have to wait another week after waiting two weeks to even get the results from my first test, to find out if I have diabetes or not. It's frustrating!",
