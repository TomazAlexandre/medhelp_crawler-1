            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!The body aches and pains can be due to post traumatic stress disorder following the accident, and you need a psychological assessment to rule this out. Other than this, it can be due to menopause, and maybe the HRT is not in the right combination. Consult your gynecologist regarding this.Unexplained aches and pains coming on and off could also be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders.Since I cannot examine you and know other related conditions you may be having, nor is a detailed history possible on net, I have listed the various possibilities that should be looked into. Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",
