            "answer": "The important thing is to identify the surgeon and ask him how many procedures he has done in the last year and month. Find out how many the hospital has done. These are uncomfortable questions, but should be asked. The best outcomes are from doctors who perform many procedures in a hospital that has performed many procedures..",

            "answer": "Hi there. Im not a doctor but will offer general advice. We have very limited info here to try and help with whats wrong. His doctors are best equipped to advise, as they have all his medical history. For example, does he have any underlying issues? Like High Blood Pressure? or Diabetes? Or any other conditions of the Kidneys? Is he on any medication at the moment?Does he smoke and how is his general health. These are all important to know. Looking at the test results, he seems to have good LV function which is a positive. There appears to be quite a number of blockages that need to be sorted promptly. Overall looking at your info above as Ger says, its most likely the By Pass will be the route chosen by his doctors, but you will have to rely on their expertise. Best of luck to you and your uncle",
