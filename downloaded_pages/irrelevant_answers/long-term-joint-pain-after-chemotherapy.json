            "answer": "Hi,Firstly you need to get a bone scan done. Discuss the reports with your doctor and post them to us too.Discuss this in detail with your oncologist then, and then decide what is the best option in your specific case. Do not take any medications without consultation with your oncologist/ breast specialist.Your doctor might put you on calcium and other supplements and also get some tests done most probably.Let us know how you are doing and keep us posted about what your doctor advises.Regards.",
