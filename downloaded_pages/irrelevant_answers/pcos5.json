            "answer": "Hi,I wanted to share my story and give some hope that PCOS symptoms can be reversed. After being diagnosed with PCOS, I didn\u2019t think it would ever be possible to have a baby, but then I found Insulite. I learned how to reverse the symptoms, feel healthier, and eventually I got pregnant. I started taking Insulite PCOS system in early November 2005 and by the end of December I was pregnant. I highly recommend checking out this system at: http://www.pcos.insulitelabs.comI found out about a naturopathic doctor and PCOS specialist, Dr. Mary Shackelton, and then began the Insulite PCOS System. I couldn't believe that within a week I was not craving sugar everyday, I felt more balanced and less frenetic about my sugar habits. Without even trying, I lost three pounds in less than a month. I had never felt more confident about my ability to choose healthy foods. I was not moody, and I felt more energetic. The Insulite PCOS System involves several herbal supplements, nutrition and exercise and I saw amazing and prompt results.Hope this system helps other women with PCOS too!
