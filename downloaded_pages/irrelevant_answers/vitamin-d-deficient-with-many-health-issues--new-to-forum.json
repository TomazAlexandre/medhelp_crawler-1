            "answer": "I've had most of your symptoms from the following: vitamin D deficiency (mine was down to 30 nmol/L/12 ng/mL), magnesium deficiency, insulin resistance, pre diabetes, hypothyroidism due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis (suffered with \"normal\" range TSH which wasn't my normal for 4 years).Vitamin D is essential for calcium absorption. I found out calcium serum is inaccurate when I had a very positive chvostek sign and requested ionized calcium which showed a deficiency.\u00a0\u00a0Insulin resistance/diabetes causes increased excretion of magnesium through the urine. Magnesium is the most important co factor for vitamin D absorption too btw.",

    "question": "Hi. I have had a pretty bad couple of years !!! That's an understatement :). To make a long story short...I have been diagnosed with Diabetes Type two with amazingly unstable Swinging levels ranging between 1.8 and 29mmol ( equivalent to 32 and 522mg ). Diagnosed with Hypertension, massively high reading around 236/127 and that's on 4 different Hypertension medications. Doctors just cant get it down. Then i was diagnosed with Cushing's Disease, High cortisol and ACTH levels. I had surgery to remove my pituitary gland earlier this year. Surgery was unsuccessful. I still have high Cortisol and ACTH. Months later after constantly telling my Endocrinologist i am so fatigued, My muscles are getting weaker, my bones ache, i get so cold even on a 30 degrees celcius day i want to hop in the fire to warm up. Finally it all came to a BIG crunch and i had a total melt down and was diagnosed with major depressive disorder ( no wonder with all i was going thru !!). When i had the melt down the Endo looked at me...probably properly for the first time, checked my strength in my arms and legs and said, Goodness you must be Vitamin D deficient !!! Sent me off for a blood test. Result. Vitamin D 13nmol/L ( 5.2ng/ml ). Yep its low. Anyway, I am seeing the Endocrinologist to discuss results in 6 days.What sort of questions should i be asking the Endo?Im also wondering how much of my issues can be related to Low Vitamin deficiency.Other Symptoms... Nausea since January 2013 ( almost every single day !)Diarrhoea ( 8 to 15 Motions per day most days )Blurred visionVisual field deficit in left eyeFrequent UTI'sVery thin skin, bruise easilyDepression as mentioned, really weird anxiety episodes ( quite Bizzare in fact) ( I am seeing a Psychologist and was Put on 150mg of sertraline )Lower back/ Hip painBurning sensation and pain in both kneesPains in fingers can lift a small plate but a dinner plate causes painFind it harder and harder to get up from a sitting positionDry Mouth / Sore tongueSwollen glands under jaw ( had an ultrasound with showed no problems other than they are enlarged.)My Jaw Clicks and is painful from time to time. I grind my teeth when in the car and sleepingHeadaches ( I am now seeing a neurologist due to visual field issue, He thinks its \" Post Op \" migraines post pituitary removal )Pain in my upper right abdomenLiver function tests are totally deranged ( on waiting list to see gastroenterologist )I get a skin rash/ sensitivity to the sunThere has been so many issues. But i guess thats a good start :)So i repeat What questions should i have for the Endo?Should they be doing any other testing?PS My calcium is normal, Iron is normal, Thyroid profile is normal, Creative protein is high, ESR is high, Prolactin is low. Anion gap ALT GGT and ALP are all Very elevated, Cholesterole has gone from 6.1 to 3.4 after 1 month of statin treatment ( I honestly think the 6.1 was a lab error as my Cholesterole has never been above 4.5 in the past ). Hba1c is 8.9Thanks for reading i know there is a lot there ! :)",
