You don't know, only the vet can tell what's going on.Is your puppy otherwise energetic and OK?? Or sleeping a lot/not playing/shivering or shaking/throwing up/diarrhea??Yes, in order to help really we need more info.Anyway, even WITH the info, we can only give you some support. We can't diagnose your dog or really help, practically. You need to take him to the vet.",
