            "answer": "Hello,We're all volunteers and not medical professionals, so be sure to check in with your doctor about everything you read here (or anywhere else online).\u00a0\u00a0Truth is that your endocrinologist knows the specifics of your diabetes health far better than any of us \"out here\" and s/he a has solid medical education to bring to bear on your set of symptoms.Back pain can have many causes that are (or are not) related to frequent urination.\u00a0\u00a0Back pain can be caused by physical injury, years of poor posture, skeletal misalignment, or other physical defects.\u00a0\u00a0Back pain can also result from urinary tract infections that spread to the kidneys and cause pain there, however you don't mention pain during urination.If you are male, frequent urination during the night can be the result of prostate issues -- quite common among males after middle-age.\u00a0\u00a0It can be the result of drinking a lot of fluid in the evening, too.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, urination can also be caused by blood sugars that are not well-maintained.Best to keep a log of your blood sugars -- which are MUCH more accurate for your doctor to use as a guide to adjusting your medication than either frequency of urination or even urine testing.\u00a0\u00a0Blood testing is our \"gold standard.\"With all this, I come back to my advice that you check in with your doctor -- quickly, if your symptoms keep you from getting good rest at night.\u00a0\u00a0Please also check in with your doctor BEFORE considering any changes to your medications.Please let us know what works to relieve your symptoms.",

            "answer": "I agree that instead of simply increasing the Lantus, you need to check with your doctor to make sure that you are not harboring an infection in the urinary tract. Most diabetics find that their blood sugars do increase when they are ill, and this could be the reason for all of the symptoms. You should be tested and infection ruled out completely before making adjustments to insulin. But don't put it off, for you don't want to be having high glucose levels for an extended period of time.",
