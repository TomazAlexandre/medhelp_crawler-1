    "question": "Help me, I am very desperateAbout 2 years ago I went from a person that sweated very much to a person that does not sweat anymore. I have found out that my condition is called Anhidrosis and this is causing me very much grief. I am very hot all the time and the bad thing is that I can't sweat anymore to keep myself cool, hell I get hot even sometimes when the air conditoner is on at it's coldest and have to take a few cold showers to keep my self cool. I heard you can get Anhidrosis from Nueropathy, I dont know if I have Nueropathy, but I have several symptoms such as numbness and pins and needles feeling. I believe that I could have Diabetes but I can't get in checked because I am Agoraphobic and can't leave my home and scared of leaving it.I am wondering if anything can be done about Anhidrosis,Is there any medication that I can take to restore sweating?Is there any doctors working on a cure for Anhidrosis?Is there any hope that Stem Cell Therapy can do for Anhidrosis?Is there any way that Sweat Glands transplants can restore my sweat function?Is there any foods that increase and if possible restore sweating?If I do have Nueropathy and if this is causing my Anhidrosis, if I can get it under control, could I reverse it and if I do reverse it, can sweat be restored to my body?I would like this to be answered by a doctor or person suffering from Anhidrosis if possible please?I wish I had Hyperhidrosis instead of Anhidrosis!",
