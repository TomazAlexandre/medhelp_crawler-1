The only item that is a slight risk for me is the hypertension, maybe. I'm fine at home but jump up to the 140's at the doctor. But now I'm on Diltiazem for chest pains and arrhythmias. That helps with the BP too.I don't see age factored in there, say menopausal women. Is estrogen not that important to heart disease?",

I have family history and have gone through the old hit and miss tests. EKG and Echo ,stress test then nuclear stress test then invasive angiogram. Even though the angiogram showed no narrowing, it doesn't show how bad my arteries are diseased, if at all .You can pass an angiogram with flying colors and still have bad plaque that has not caused stenosis. The Intra vascular ultrasound apparently shows soft plaque but is not readily available. Its no wonder so many people have the disease and don't know it ! Medicine is very reactive, not proactive. I fear cardiologists are financially hooked on angioplasty and bypass sugery and may be a little concerned their livelyhood will suffer if they actually prevent CAD in society. I hope I'm wrong.",

Do you think they would fix the problem if that many jets crashed every day ? When I sat waiting for my angiogram I talked to many people who were on their second bypass, 4th stent, etc and were ill again. With the medication we have available that is unacceptable. All we ask is to have 80 years of good health without suffering from heart attacks and strokes which lower our quality of life considerably. I'm happy to hear your numbers are good!",

            "answer": "I agree with you to a point.\u00a0\u00a0I agree that traditional medicine is focused on high cost diagnostic methods and procedural treatments. In this regard, medicine behaves as a market economy should in that it adjusts to provide for advances in products and services where the major focus is located. I think the problem is that reimbursement, which at the end of the day is a major driver of where product and services are developed in any industry, is absent for preventative measures within the third party of government supported healthcare.Until your primary care doctor is compensated based on his ability to keep you healthy, risk free and off medication by an educational multidisciplinary process that includes dieticians, exercise counselors, genetic counselors for those with familial disorder and stress management counselors because we know that this contributes to disease. Until someone pays a pcp to do this complex process more than they pay him for being a distributor of high cost pharmaceutical drugs, there will be minimal change in practice patterns.Additionally, on the patient side, until there is some punishment for people who use an excessively high amount of health care resources because of life style behaviors which lead them to illness like smoking, sedentary, elevated BMI. Until there is that responsibility on the patient side with some financial impact, then any system is up against insurmountable challenges",

            "answer": "With all due respect. In most areas of the nation, the day and age of the \"private practice physican is over\". My primary care colleagues who still maintain private practice structures occasionally go without paychecks to meet their payroll obligations and they do this because they want to continue to practice good medicine and provide a service to the community. Most PCP's are now employees of larger organizations like kaiser permanante or a univerisity. So, its a bit inaccurate to blame your doctor when no one answers a phone or you have an 8-5 mentality within the \"new\" era of medicine.If you interpreted my post to suggest that nationalized medicine is the answer, I did a poor job of communicating. Since the inception of medicare, we have had nationalized insurance outside of the VA. Medicare is government healthcare system, its just been privately administered. Your comment that physicians are to be held to a high standard is accurate. I was trained that a professional is a highly trained and specialized providor of a service who is compensated for providing that service. When the professional is not available, the professional makes arrangements for their service to continue uninterrupted. By relegating a new generation of physicians to an employee mentality, society has unfortunately undermined the very professionalism that they have come to expect. Bottom line, if society want and expects highly trained and highly accountable professionals, society must be willing to treat them with a degree of respect due to professionals. And part of the \"perceived\" aspect of respect is compensation. Perhaps US Senators, professional athletes and Corporate CEO's should decrease their compensation by 10% per year to demonstrate how benevolent they are for their field of passion. We all should aspire to practice our occupation with passion and hopefully we would do it even if we were working for free. Perhaps we could all benefit from recognizing that this is a complex problem with many features of the system broken. I would be interested in hearing about your solution aside from \"shooting the doctors\"",

Amazingly, 50 to 70 percent of those individuals who died from a heart attack were not aware of their risk. Worldwide, over 19 million people die from a heart attack each year.Definition of a vulnerable patient:Individuals who are at risk of a near future heart attack are called vulnerable patient. One way of characterizing this population is to define those with 5% or more risk of heart attack in one year. In other words, in 10 years one out of two vulnerable patients will definitely experience a heart attack.Risk factors include:Family history MI (sister, brother, mother, father)StrokeHypertensionHigh CholesterolDiabetesSmokingSedentary lifestyleObesity - greater than 20% of ideal weightclaudication-calf or thigh pain with walking exertionHow may members are high risk ie 2 or more risk factors??",
