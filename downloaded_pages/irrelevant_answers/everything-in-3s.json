            "answer": "I got diabetes as a result of a liver transplant in June 2000. I treated with TX for 3.5 years 1) with regular interferon and ribavirirn 48 weeks 2)Peg-Intron\u00a0\u00a0and ribavirin 52 weeks and 3)Pegasys and ribavirin for 73 weeks. I reached SVR the last time around and stopped TX June 2004. I used insulin throughout the TX and controlled my diabetes tightly. If you are clear 1 year post TX you should be fine and the treatment of diabetes should pose no risk. Graves I am not prpared to discuss but the diabetes should not be a problem as far as your SVR goes. Mike",

            "answer": "Sorry the other thread is closed and I want to answer you.Companies are not allowed to send out \"secret, confidential\" emails discussing your disease and guessing about things. See below.DISCRIMINATION.At no time had I ever faltered in my work...but they had already decided that because I had HEP B (that is what they said which was NOT even CORRECT - my boss did inform them it was C) and on \"chemo\" which was \"extremely debilitating\" I would need to take FMLA and what they said they should do was \"hire someone else and give her busy work until she was too sick to work and would leave\".Of course...as you know with hepC it might be a drag to work but you surely CAN and do it just as well as before (but I have a desk job so it's not impossible)So their suppositions were completely discriminatory against me with a disease.PS REMINDER - A COMPANY HAS TO HOLD YOU 'A' JOB NOT 'YOUR' JOB if you go out on FMLA type disability things. There is NO guarantee when you come back that they won't stick you in some stupid mundane job shuffling papers and then six months later say \"this position is being done away with\".\u00a0\u00a0You DONT necessarily get back YOUR position like most people errantly think.",
