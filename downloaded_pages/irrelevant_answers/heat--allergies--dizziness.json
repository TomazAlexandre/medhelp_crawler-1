            "answer": "Hi, welcome to the forum, heat and dizziness is quite suggestive of mild to moderate dehydration. The factors responsible for worsening symptoms when exposed to heat are-- Evaporation of water from the skin in hot climates.- Decreased intake of water.- Associated conditions like diabetes, anxiety, diuretic use etc.Dehydration can lead to irritability, confusion, rapid pulse, low BP, increased respiratory rate, dry mouth, dry skin, dark concentrated urine etc.You need to maintain your water intake chart. Take adequate fluids throughout the day. You need to undergo skin testing to rule out allergy. You need to avoid exposure to allergens, even heat can cause sweating and in turn sweating worsens the allergy.Talcum, Aluminum Chloride with Ethyl Alcohol, Anticholinergics or Propantheline Bromide at bedtime can be used against prescription. The actual treatment would be treatment of the primary cause. Take care and regards.",
