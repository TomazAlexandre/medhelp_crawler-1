I go back again this week (27weeks) to look at it again and rule out if it is a possible tumor which I am praying it is not. Its a simple procedure.",

            "answer": "I think that's what I'm being referred for. The doctor said I'd need to see a cardiologist for her heart at 28 weeks. He's been watching her closely since 17 weeks. I'm labeled moderate to high risk due to a few factors and they are watching her heart closely, but things looked good at her 17 week and 21 week scans. I go in tomorrow for my 29 week scan and that is when they will determine whether or not we head to the cardiologist. I'll keep you and your baby in my prayers. Remember God has a plan that is so much bigger than our worries or fears.",

I went for my 20 week scan 2 weeks ago and they told me everything looks good but I need to go for a Fetal Echo to get a better look at the heart.. I've been thinking about it since and don't know if they are having me go because I'm high risk and want to take caution or if there is something wrong with the babies heart..",
