            "answer": "You are asking a question which everyone asks themselves when surgery is involved but there is nobody on this planet who can give you that answer. All you can do is look at the risk factors given to you by the cardiac surgeon. If someone has kidney problems for example they would be at greater risk. If someone has lots of heart tissue damage, this will be a greater risk. Someone who has no other problems, has a strong heart apart from blockages, then they stand a very good chance indeed.To accept an 85 year old for bypass surgery, I have to assume he is quite fit and healthy for his age for consideration.",

            "answer": "Hi Vicky,I know it's worrisome when loved ones, especially older loved ones, have open heart surgery. Over the last two years, both of my parents, who are in their 80s, had bypass surgery and both of them survived. My Dad has diabetes and my Mom also has a condition called hydrocephalus (has a brain shunt to drain off excess water/fluid), so they had other health issues besides heart problems.I agree with Ed; if a person's heart is so weak or damaged that the risk of doing the surgery is too high, the doctors won't go ahead and do it. So the fact that they accepted your great uncle for surgery is a good sign.The best thing you can do is visit him as soon as they allow, be his eyes and ears when he's groggy, etc. Don't be afraid to ask questions if something doesn't seem right or you don't understand what the doctors or nurses are doing or why they are doing it.Let us know how it goes.",
