    "question": "I am 21 and had chlamydia months ago and was treated and have been on anti biotics since. I have had the same sexual partner and we both were treated and she had a pap test done and came back clean. Unfortunately for me I developed balanitis a while later and I went to my doctor and she prescribed me an anti fungal cream. I have been keeping GOOD hygiene aswell as making sure to keep the head dry. I have been abstaining from sexual intercourse but it seemed to be going away until yesterday a few red dots appeared again. I am almost out of cream and I booked an appointment with my doctor for monday. What I'm asking is other than diabetes what kind of an infection could lower my immune system or cause this to not go away... I had a terrible episode of gastro-intestinal problems about a month ago. I have had balanitis for over a month now and I am worried I might have some kind of virus that bloodtests are not picking up.",
