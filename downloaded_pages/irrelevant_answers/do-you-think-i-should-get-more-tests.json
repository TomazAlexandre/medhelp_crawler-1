            "answer": "Please post the range for the TSH results. Most docs will not run tests other than TSH, if that number is within normal range (although normal doesn't always mean \"normal\"). I suggest that you talk to your general practioner about all of your symptoms and allow her/him to refer to the specialists in those areas. Have you been screened for diabetes?? Do you have any hypothyroid symptoms?? You can google \"hypothyroid symptoms\" to see a list of symptoms. Your TSH level can fluctuate especially if there is a thyroid issue that is not treated.",

I have looked at the symptoms and seem to have more hyperthyroid symptoms than hypo which doesn't correlate with the result at all...maybe I'm barking up totally the wrong tree. I have seen an endocrinogist and he ruled out diabetes (Hb1Ac was 28 but again don't have range ...sorry). Do you think it's worth asking for T3 and T4 levels to be checked or not?Thanks again :)",

            "answer": "I was with the endo or a maximum of about 15 minutes!! He did not do any further tests for thyroid (at the time I'd had the TSH of 1.25 about 2 months previously) so he said that was not the case. He did the Hb1Ac and said this ruled out diabetes (he only did this because I asked...constantly feel like I have low blood sugar and need to eat...I know diabetes is high blood sugar though). The only other things he did are 24hr urine cortisol...result was 296mmol (sorry no ref range again but told this was normal) and dexamethasone suppresion which came back as 39 (170-540) bt apparently this low is normal for the suppresion test)...he did these as my 9am cortisol was high a number of times (latest one was 605 for a range of 170-540)...so all cortisol things ruled out apparently!! He also did some hormone tests as my periods have been really light and short (completely abnormal for me) with the following results:LH 16.9 (2.4-12.6)Testosterone 1.6 (0-1.8)SHBG 110 (20-130)FAI 1.1 (0-4.5)FSH 4.6 (3.5-12.5)Thank you again :)",

Gastric parietal cell antibody is associated with over 90% of patients with autoimmune gastritis.Your symptoms that are listed under malabsorption of B12: fatigue, itchy skin, excessive thirst, high heart rate, nausea, frequent urination, loose, frequent bowel movements (can be alternating constipation and diarrhea), low grade fevers.I would personally recommend sublingual B12 spray. I use this daily for my autoimmune pernicious anaemia. Your B12 issues are not low enough for dementia and nerve damage yet but over time they will be if malabsorption is not corrected.",

The co factors for iron are vitamin C, vitamin B12, folate and iron. Co factors help with absorption. When i corrected my B12, my folate rose as well without any folate supplements. You can take all three supplements however.Iron supplements may cause nausea (maybe you won't know since you suffer from nausea lol).\u00a0\u00a0I never have nausea from iron tablets however. I take a brand called Swisse and it's chelated iron for better absorption. I've never taken folate supplements but i get plenty of folate and some of the other B vitamins from vegemite. LOL.",

Can I just ask what brand of B12 you use? Going to do some research about it in the uk and would be good to know what's worked for you.Interesting what you said about age when symptoms began...I picked up every infection gong as a child/teen and then have had episodes of feeling like this since I was 18...this is by far the longest/worse though...maybe it's because I've turned 30!!!:)",

I would say my thirst is more a really dry mouth which makes me want to drink more rather than excessive thirst...does that make sense? I've got an appt with my GP on tues and I guess I just want to make sure I ask her about any other tests that may be worth doing...I'm going to ask about free T3 and T4 just to get this ruled out properly...is there anything else you think is worth asking?? She has looked at previous results and as long as they're in normal range she completely dismisses them e.g. Folate was 30 (12-300) and ferritin 11 (10-30) and she said this was fine...even though I could have ten times as much and still be the same??!! Just doesn't seem to make sense! It sounds like this is nothing new to you though :(I am slightly sceptical of drs...it took them 6 years to diagnose my dad with Coeliac...he ended up about 7 stone ( and over 6 foot tall) and in hospital before they found out what it was...that was about 12 years ago but still!!!I hope you've managed to get to the bottom of your health problems x",

    "question": "Hi,I'm so sorry if this is posted in the wrong place but I'm really desperate for some advice and feel like the drs have pretty much given up!! My symptoms started about 9 months ago and seem to have got progressively worse in this time. I feel nauseous a lot, am ridiculously tired (but only able to get broken sleep), have itchy palms of hands/feet (and sometimes head!!), dry mouth/constantly thirsty, constantly hot, increased urination and bowel movements (sometimes loose but not always) and high heart rate (had abnormal ECG which showed inverted t waves??). So...I was wondering about thyroid problems particularly as there is a high incidence of autoimmune conditions on both sides of my family (coeliac, graves, pernicious anaemia). Can anyone make any sense of these results...High/high normal cortisol, MCH, testosteroneLow/low normal white blood cells count (particularly monocytes), platelets, ferritin and folate levelsTSH was 1.25 in December and 2.25 this week...is this normal? I know the range is ok and wondered if it usual for it to fluctuate.Everything else seems pretty much bang on normal ranges (e.g. B12) haven't had any other thyroid checks done because of normal TSH. They also identified that I have high IgA and gastric parietal cell antibodies (but not intrinsic factor).Any advice REALLY gratefully received :)",
