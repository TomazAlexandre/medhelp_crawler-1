            "answer": "Hi.Based on your clinical presentation, it appears you might be experiencing \"drop foot\".Drop foot is not a disease but a symptom of an underlying condition.\u00a0\u00a0It is usually related to an injury of the peroneal nerve, a branch of the sciatic nerve.This symptom could be caused by a lot of conditions including nerve compression secondary to lumbar disc herniation, spinal stenosis, trauma to the sciatic nerve, spondylolisthesis, spinal cord injury, bone fractures, stroke, tumor, diabetes, or crush-type injuries. It could also be found in cases of ALS, MS, and Parkinson's Disease.It would be premature for you to think that your diagnosis is already ALS. It would be best to undergo the suggested MRIs first and consult a neurologist to evaluate your symptoms completely.Good luck.",

    "question": "I am 38 years old and pretty scared right now.\u00a0\u00a0Other than high blood pressure, I have been very healthy.\u00a0\u00a0In August 2007, I began experiencing tremors/pulsations in my right leg.\u00a0\u00a0During September the right leg then began to feel weaker, I have not been able to wear heels and was experiencing clumsiness. I do not have as much control over the right leg/foot as I do with the left.\u00a0\u00a0I also have begun occassionally dragging the right foot. When referred to my Neurologist, had a Brain and lower spine MRI done.\u00a0\u00a0Nothing was found.\u00a0\u00a0Recently I had an EMG done and it showed abnormally only in the right leg.\u00a0\u00a0I had a pelvic MRI done on Monday, but I haven't received the results.\u00a0\u00a0I have just started reading all the boards and I am terrified that I have something like ALS.\u00a0\u00a0My Neurologist indicated that if nothings shows in the pelvic MRI, I will have a MRI of the upper and middle spine and if nothing shows there, he will need to refer to me.I have been crying for days reading about ALS.\u00a0\u00a0Based on what I described could this be something that is not as devastating as ALS.",
