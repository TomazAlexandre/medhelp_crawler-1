            "answer": "As I'm sure you know, it's impossible to tell for sure what the problem is over the internet, especially with limited information.\u00a0\u00a0However, to me, it sounds like it may be flea bites.\u00a0\u00a0Are there any animals in the house or have you been around any animals?\u00a0\u00a0Fleas can also be in taller, dry grass, so even if there aren't any animals around that you've been near, but have been out walking in the grass, it's still possible for flea bites.To help with the itch, you may want to try either an over the counter anti itch cream (usually has hydrocortisone in it) or even rubbing alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0Do your best not to scratch, as it only irritates the area more and can end up causing an infection if you break the skin.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Diabetes, psoriasis, hypothyroidism, contact dermatitis, atopic dermatitis and malnutrition should be ruled out first. Itchy feet with tiny white blisters could be eczema, fungal infection, dermatitis, contact allergy with allergens like soap, chemicals, shoe material etc.\u00a0\u00a0If you itch between toes too, there are chances that it is scabies, fungal infection and sweat dermatitis. See if your feet come in contact with particular grass, shrubs, chemical etc. It can also be an infection under the skin or cellulitis. Do discuss this with a skin specialist as confirmed diagnosis is not possible on net. Take care!",
