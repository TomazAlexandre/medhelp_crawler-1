            "answer": "Hello,To me, I hope that I am wrong, you are likely a pre-diabetic, either type 1\u00a0\u00a0or 2 . Question: Why\u00a0\u00a0with a single and random glucose reading at 165, that I conclude such guessing. Answer:It's very simply, a 5th grader can conclude the same thing as I did.Why? Because a non diabetic reading is almost always less then 120, even 1 hr. after meal.to end this anxiety over being a diabetic or not, the esiest way is to buy a self-test kit called A1C Now, made by Bayer, at Walmart for $23USD, follow instruction, then within 5-10 minutes, voila , here is your A1c readingif your A1c is between 5.6% to 6.4%,then according to the US Health Dept you are a pre-diabetic and so on...Good luck.",

            "answer": "Without knowing the exact time of testing all we can do is guess and speculate on your outcome. It makes a BIG difference when you test your blood sugar [glucose]. Not knowing your country of residence, the following are testing times with US measurement units. The UK and other countries, like Canada, require conversion from mg/dl to mmol/l.\u25cf Fasting - first thing in morning before eating or drinking anything except water.Normal levels is 60/70 to 99 mg/dlPrediabets is 100 to 125 mg/dlDiabetes is considered >126 mg/dl\u25cf Preprandial - before a meal, Same as noraml\u25cf Postprandial - 2-3 hours after a meal. <141 mg/dl, optimum <121 mg/dl. Normal is normal fasting levelsIf you post back with postprandial test result be sure to include what foods were consumed as certain foods can/will elevate your blood sugar levels more than others.Random anytime testing is useless as they result in false/positive readings.Lastly, an A1c of 5.6% equates to an estimated daily glucose [blood sugar] average of 114 mg/dl, prediabetes. Please note, not everyone has the same A1c target range as it depends on ones health and life expectancy. Target ranges/goals should be discussed with your health care provider.",
