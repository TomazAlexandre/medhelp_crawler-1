            "answer": "Prediabetes is someone whose blood sugars are elevated but not as high as qualifies for a full diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. (Fasting = 100-125 and A1C = 5.7-6.4). If you are prediabetic it is an excellent opportunity to slow down the progression to full diabetes or even prevent it altogether. This will be done with a combination of diet (eating less carbs), exercise and weight loss if you are overweight. Ask your doctor or research online for a program of the above that will work for you.",

            "answer": "Is your doctor prescribing you Metformin? My suggestion is always to try diet, exercise and weight loss first and if those don't lower blood sugar enough then consider meds. Exercise doesn't need to be heavy. Even regular walking can lower blood sugar. There is a lot of information online about diet, but stay away from fad \"diabetes diets\". Basically carbs are what raise blood sugar, simple carbs raise it worse. So stay away from or greatly limit all sugar, white rice, potatoes, cereal, bread. Some people can eat whole grains or brown rice, for some of us it doesn't matter, it still spikes our blood sugar. All diabetics are different. The way to find out what works for YOU is to test, test, test. Eat a food you like and test your blood sugar two hours after eating. It needs to be under 140; under 120 is even better. If it is higher, than you can't eat that food, or that amount of that food. A lot of testing in the beginning will help you figure out what foods and what amounts of those foods work for you.",

            "answer": "Again, I sould seek more information. They are telling you your blood sugar is normal but giving you Metformin?? That doesn't make sense. You said you had the OGTT 2 hour test and it was \"high but not diabetic\". Were you diagnosed pre-diabetic. Again the A1C, not the OGTT or a fasting blood sugar is what gives you a diagnosis. I would ask for more information. You haven't even been told what you are being treated for!",

            "answer": "Ok, I read back and it sounds like you have been diagnosed with prediabetes. Although technically you haven't been given the correct test to do this. Some doctors do give medication for pre-diabetes, though imho it is premature. But again, you need to cut carbs, lose weight and exercise as you are able. I suggest you get the book Blood Sugar 101 by Jennie Ruhl either online or from Amazon. You need to learn more about pre-diabetes and diabetes.",

            "answer": "Ok, that explains it a little bit. It can be hard to lose weight because of the insulin resistance and the metformin may help with that. But besides losing weight you want to also exercise and cut carbs. Carbs are what raise blood sugar. I suggest you get a glucose meter and then you can take your fasting blood sugar which should be under 100. But more important, because it sounds like here is where your problem is, is testing two hours after eating. You should be under 140 and under 120 is even better. If you are higher than you know you either can't eat that food or can't eat as much of it. Lowering carbs will not only reduce your blood sugar but will also help you lose weight. Simple carbs like sugar should be eliminated. But other carbs such as bread, cereal, potatos and pasta can raise your blood sugar as well. We are all different, so testing is the best way to see what works for you. Doctors can diagnose (at least some can!) and prescribe medication but in the end diabetes is a self management condition and learning how to do this is what will slow or even stop your progression to full diabetes.",

            "answer": "Please don't panic. Even full blown diabetes is a manageable condition with a combination of diet, exercise, weight loss and medication as needed. People live long and healthy lives with diabetes as long as they continue to monitor their blood sugar and do what is needed to keep it in range. Please read my response just above as it gives you some useful ideas for how to manage your blood sugar. Blood sugar management and weight loss are alike in that they are one day at a time. If you let yourself think about the total of how much weight you want to lose, or dwell on your fears of diabetes you will get overwhelmed. So take it one step, one diet change, one pound at a time. Get Blood Sugar 101. Knowledge is the best antidote for fear. You can do this as so many other people have. But if your fear and panic is overwhelming, it sounds like you may need some help with that. If the buspirone is not helping your anxiety you might want to return to the prescribing doctor and get a change in meds or dose. You might also consider starting therapy. Medication is only 1/2 the treatment for anxiety-therapy can help give you skills to deal with your anxiety and break things down into manageable pieces.",
