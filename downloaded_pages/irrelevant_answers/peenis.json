            "answer": "Hi there!The size of the penis is normally described in proportion to the body size and is measured when erect. Micropenis is described as size less than 2.2 inches. While there are a few surgical procedures/ phalloplasty, that may help increase the size of the penis these are often not required and neither advised in the absence of a functional abnormality. Erectile dysfunction can develop in young adults due to a variety of causes. Psychological stress, anxiety, depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, just to name a few. Stress and anxiey are the most common causes in young adults. It is best advised to begin by de-stressing yourself/ working on the psychological issues and getting rid of any of the mentioned issues, if involved. If this doesn\u2019t seem to help I would suggest an evaluation by a urologist or a primary care physician for to look for secondary causes and appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",
