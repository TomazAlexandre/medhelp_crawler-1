            "answer": "People with nodules commonly have anxiety as the nodules are leaking hormone, causing our bodies to go into overdrive. What brand and level hormone are you taking? You may not be on enough. Your doctor should be testing and treating your FT3 and Ft4 levels, not TSH, a pituitary hormone. Many patients fall into a trap with endos who treat by the old standards, according to TSH levels. If I'd listened to my last endo, I'd still be severely hypothyroid because she only wanted to treat TSH. According to her, I should be on half as much thyroid hormone as I'm currently taking.Benign nodules can grow as the thyroid is under attack. Malignant nodules can grow as well, however multi-nodules are less likely to have cancer.I am with a new set of doctors now. They believe there is a strong link between gluten and thyroid disease as well as diabetes. I am now gluten-free and doing much better. They have all of their Hashi and diabetes patients quit gluten.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "BTW - I'm not saying you need the thyroid hormone to be increased now with your hyper symptoms. Yes, ear ringing and trouble sleeping are also signs of hyperthryoidism. I would get the hyper issues, but when those went away, I started my thyroid hormone.Get your FT3 and FT4 tests.Also, get your adrenals tested. Adrenal fatigue and thyroid disease commonly go hand-in-hand. The 24 hour saliva is the only reliable test. Blood cortisol and 24 hour urine are not as reliable. :) T.",

            "answer": "I don't know why they are growing. Could be because your thyroid is under attack by antibodies. That is why mine grew. You are currently taking a child's dose of Levo. I honestly don't know if you are on enough hormone to shrink those nodules.Please get your TSH, FT4 and FT3 and then start a new thread or just send me a message with your levels.Also, get your TGab and TPOab antibodies checked for Hashimoto's, which commonly causes nodules.You have hyper symptoms, so you may not be able to up your hormone yet, but get the levels checked to be sure. Also, adrenals if you are lucky enough to find a good doctor, as adrenal issues can be confused with hyperthyroidism. My chiropractor checks mine.BTW - My thyroid attacks stopped when I quit gluten. No more swelling and no more new nodules.:) Tamra",
