            "answer": "Christie,We are volunteers here & not medical professionals.\u00a0\u00a0We all have considerable experience with Type 1 diabetes (it's a different disease than Type 2), however.My strong recommendation to you is that you get a referral or just make an appointment with a Certified Diabetes Educator or Diabetologist or Endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0Folks with TYpe 1 typically test 4-10 times a day, I'm not sure what's recommended for Type 2.I do notice that you're doing all the testing and for each diabetic, we must -- as individuals -- take responsibility for our care, if we have the mental & physical ability to do so.\u00a0\u00a0Please encourage your hubby to read about Type 2 (it's good for you to read, too) *and* make an appointment with a medical professional who will spend the time.\u00a0\u00a0You can expect multiple appointments over time.Good luck.",

    "question": "My husband has been recently diagnosed with Type 2.\u00a0\u00a0We were given little education beyond \"take this pill twice a day\".I have been checking his blood sugars about twice a week.\u00a0\u00a0Once fasting (he is now running about 100-110) and 2 hours post meals (now running about 130-139).My question is, should I be checking him more often?\u00a0\u00a01 hour post meals, as opposed to 2 hours?\u00a0\u00a0I know these values are pretty good, and I'm pleased with his efforts at weight loss and compliance with medication.He goes back in 3 months for a A1C.\u00a0\u00a0Do I need to check him at all?\u00a0\u00a0I'd like to think it's good to keep an eye on this.\u00a0\u00a0His doctor vaguely threatened to \"put him on insulin\" if his A1C isn't normal in 3 months.",
