            "answer": "this is my experience of one and i just had two in the last 2 months and both times were after fooling around and close to my period. i kind of knew i was getting one because it felt like something was \"brewing\" down there, like itchy,\"full\" if that makes sense? then it progressivly gets worse. more itchy, red/irritated/swollen and thick,clumpy \"cottage cheese\" like discharge. can make any nice woman miserable!! gross..but if you open the vaginal lips you will see the white discharge just sitting there. i had to go out and buy monistat treatment to clear it up. i buy the 3 day treatment because i have found and others have experienced that the 1 day really isnt effective. its the 3 or even 7 day that does. you should have it diagnosed by the dr. if you are not sure if its a yeast infection. then if it comes back at some point you will know what it is and can treat it on your own. do you think this is what you have?",

    "question": "Hi Ladies-I have posted on here before about concerns with conceiving and you guys were really helpful.I have had another problem for YEARS - recurrent yeast infections. It started after I had warts about 6 years ago . I have been taking herbs ( accidophillus) and eating yogurt - I gave up on monistat and things like that cause i read that yeast becomes immune to that-So i am happy cause the yeast does go down when i eat the yogurt and take the herbs but have you guys heard about a yeast overgrowth in the body ? I read about cutting out bread and things like thatI have been tested for all the stds, including HIV and all are negative THANK GOD -..should i be concerned that the yeast is a bigger problem?",
