    "question": "My daughter gets mouth ulcers whenever she's run down, and has been getting 4 or 5 at any given time over a period of the last 6 months, due to a low immune system caused by low iron. She's on iron supplements and the doctor said they should have cleared up by now, but they haven't. In fact they haven't changed. It's getting to the point where it's just ridiculous, she can't even eat anymore! She's in too much pain! She has to have meal replacement drinks, and has to force at least one meal a day down her throat, causing her considerable pain, you can see tears in her eyes! This is just stupid. How do we get rid of them?? We're at the point of exhaustion. The doctor said all we can do is wait for them to heal or wash with salt water. But there's got to be something else if these aren't working! Please help, this is just ridiculous.",
