    "question": "I'm 16, 5'8\", male, and 230 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I just started using this app a few days ago because I'm just fed up with gaining weight.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not gaining very quickly, only about 15 lbs. over the last two years, but I'm not getting any taller and I'm ready to lose it.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I've been coming in well under my calorie limit and I'm feeling very optimistic.\u00a0\u00a0So, if I continue to do that and walk for about an hour or more a day on a treadmill or outside once the weather cools down, how long do you think it would take for me to get down to about 165-175 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I know people lose weight at different rates, but just for a bit of a benchmark, my dad used this app for about a month (don't know why he quit) without any exercise and he lost 10 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for your help!",
