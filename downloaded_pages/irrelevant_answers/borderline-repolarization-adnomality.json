    "question": "About 6 months ago I had my mom rush me to the hospital because my heart was racing and I felt like i couldnt breath right. I was worried I was having a heart attack. Well i was tested for everything under the sun. The EKG shows Sinus Tachycardia and Borderline Repolarization Adnomality.Rate:119PR:192QRSD:104QT:304QTc:428P:44QRS:45T:-62I also had low potassium (3.1) and Glucose was high (122). Also my white blood count was high in all aspects. Im 26 years old Male and i am a bit over weight. I am trying to figure out what is going on. I have had Tachy happen 3 more times but didnt go to the hospital. It seems if i drink alot of caffiene it happens. But the thing i am worried about is that ever since it has happened i have a weird chest pain when i am either hungry or have to go to the bathroom.",
