            "answer": "A spinal tumor could certainly cause incontinence. Usually you'd see weakness in the legs and back pain, that being said I'd push for a full brain & spine MRI with & without contrast just to be sure..My son is 3 years old, he has a brain tumor. Pediatric brain & spinal cord tumors rare, but it does happen & can present with a variety of symptoms. My sons tumor was found incidentally when he fell at daycare and the ER doctor ordered a CT, despite the large size of his tumor he was symptom free.I'm sure his MRI will probably be clear, but for your own piece of mind I'd do it. And I completely agree that all medical causes should be ruled out before saying he needs to be \"retrained\".Best of luck,Jessica",

            "answer": "I just came across your post.\u00a0\u00a0My 8 year old daughter has started \"leaking\" urine out of nowhere as well.\u00a0\u00a0She had a bladder ultrasound which was normal and an x-ray of her abdomen, which showed she was constipated.\u00a0\u00a0I found that hard to belive b/c she poops every day, but they told me to give her miralax every day.\u00a0\u00a0We have been doing it for 3 weeks now, and there is really no improvement.\u00a0\u00a0We have to go in a month for a test called a flow-emg to see if her bladder muscles have become lazy, or weak.\u00a0\u00a0She wears a pad to school every day, and I am more traumatized than she is , but I just want it to stop.\u00a0\u00a0Did you ever find the cause of your son's wetting?",

            "answer": "we are going through what you are with your daughter.\u00a0\u00a0Mine is 9 and she started have no bladder control about 13 days after being diagnosed with a bladder infection. after two ultrasounds of her bladder and kidneys, one by a pediatric urologist, we were told that she has detruser fallibility.\u00a0\u00a0she was also x-rayed and told it was due to her constipation and, again like you, when that problem was corrected, nothing changed.\u00a0\u00a0The only tests she has had were the ultrasounds.\u00a0\u00a0No other tests were done, even though we (her parents) both have diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0We are her maternal grandparents. She is on oral medication and we have not seen any improvement.\u00a0\u00a0This has been going on for almost 2 months.\u00a0\u00a0From reading these posts, I need to continue to push for more tests.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you and your child.Sharon216",

            "answer": "Hey, this happened to my daughter too and as it turned out she has an overactive bladder, so she started taking ditropan daily which stops the muscles of the bladder spasming & is doing just fine now. Maybe worth a try! Good luck, Laura",

    "question": "My 5 year old son was toilet trained well at 2.5 years. Five weeks ago he became incontinent of urine (day and night).\u00a0\u00a0Our paed. has confirmed no UTI, no diabetes, ultrasound of kidney and bladder is normal.\u00a0\u00a0We have tried rewards ....nothing works.\u00a0\u00a0He states that \"it just comes out\".\u00a0\u00a0We can take him to the bathroom to pee and 20 minutes later his pants are wet again.\u00a0\u00a0We never used to have to even remind him.\u00a0\u00a0He is bright and has had no emotional trauma or change in routine.\u00a0\u00a0We have been told to fill out sheets (voiding diary) for one month to \"re-train\" his bladder.\u00a0\u00a0Three days of this has only proven that we do not believe he has ANY control over this.\u00a0\u00a0He is embarrased and upset.\u00a0\u00a0Is it possible this could be due to a spinal or brain tumor or would there HAVE to be other symptoms (ie. bowel or problems walking).\u00a0\u00a0Our inclination is to request spinal and brain MRI and a urodynamic study...we believe that the physical causes should be ruled out prior to assuming \"retraining\" is the answer....although in the interim we are trying this route with no apparent success.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for your help.\u00a0\u00a0Jennifer",
