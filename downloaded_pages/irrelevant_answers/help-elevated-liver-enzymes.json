    "question": "A couple of weeks ago i started having mild pains in ny upper right quadrant. I have been working out very hard even injuring my left arm after my doctor told me i had to lose weight due to diabetes. 6 weeks ago i had blood work done and everything was normal. Now a few days ago i had another blood work done and when i got my results my doctor said my liver enzyma are elevated. She sent me for another blood test as well as an ultrasound to make sure eeverything is ok. After my ultrasound i peaked at the screen and seen a spot that was white in my gallblader not sure what it is. Can gallbladder cause elevated enzymes with ast/alt test? Or what else could cause this?",
