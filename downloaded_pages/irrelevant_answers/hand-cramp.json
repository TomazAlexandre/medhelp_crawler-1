            "answer": "Hand cramps are commonly caused by a simple calcium deficiency. Try drinking two glasses of milk a day. If this doesn't work try magnesium glycinate capsules. Ocasionally the cramps are due to a magnesium deficiency.Sadly, the best\u00a0\u00a0treatment for hand cramps was been withdrawn from the market by the FDA (Quinine sulfate). It's still available from druggest, but of course they aren't technically supposed to sell it to you.",

            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for the question. Usually, muscle cramps are common in salt imbalance, circulatory problems, with certain medications, excessive cold temperature, whilst you are relaxed or resting, during or after exercise, or after sitting in an uncomfortable position. Most of the times, they are not related to any underlying disorder but needs checking out with a doctor to assess that your leg circulation and nerve supply are working appropriately. Meanwhile, I would suggest eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables, vitamin E & zinc supplement, drink at least eight glasses of water in a day and avoid smoking. Hope this helps.",
