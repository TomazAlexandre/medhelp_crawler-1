You certainly don't believe you are HepC free b/c you used Milk Thistle?\u00a0\u00a0If it made you feel better and that's all you wanted then you accomplished what you wanted to, and good for you.\u00a0\u00a0It has been know to lower VL, but it does nothing as far as eliminating the virus from your system.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to get rid of my HepC and MT isn't gonna accomplishment that for me.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck with your herbal experience.\u00a0\u00a0Oh I placed a warning I found on another site, so if anyone is considering messing around with MT read all you can about it first.\u00a0\u00a0laterA warning about milk thistle and drug interactionsThe seeds of the milk thistle plant are commonly used to protect the liver from damage caused by hepatitis viruses as well as alcohol andother substances. Compounds found in milk thistle \u0097 sylibin, sylimarin \u0097 act as antioxidants and also stimulate the repair of the liver.But now it appears that these and possibly other compounds in milk thistle can have other effects.Researchers at the University of Pittsburgh have suspected that milk thistle can slow down or reduce the activity of enzymes in the liver.Enzymes in the liver break down many of the substances that we eat and drink, including medications. If the activity of these enzymesare reduced, then drugs remain in the blood longer than they otherwise might. This could lead to having higher-than-expected levels ofdrugs in the body, causing side effects or intensifying already-existing side effects. Indeed, in recent experiments using milk thistle andhuman liver cells, the researchers found that relatively small concentrations of milk thistle did significantly slow down the activity of theliver enzyme CYP3A4 by 50% to 100%.Many medications taken by people with HIV/AIDS (PHAs) \u0097 such as protease inhibitors and non-nukes \u0097 are processed by this liverenzyme. If milk thistle is taken by someone using protease inhibitors or non-nukes, it has the potential to raise levels of these drugs,causing unpleasant or even dangerous side effects. Below is a short list of some other medications that are processed through theCYP3A4 enzyme. Levels of these medications may increase if taken by people who are also using milk thistle. This list is not exhaustive:\u2022 methadone\u2022 heart drugs \u0096 Tambocor (flecainide), Rythmol (propafenone)\u2022 antibiotics \u0096 erythromycin, rifampin\u2022 anti-seizure drugs \u0096 carbamazepine (Tegretol)\u2022 antidepressants \u0096 St. John\u2019s wort, Zyban/Wellbutrin (bupropion), Paxil (paroxetine), Prozac (fluoxetine), Luvox (fluvoxetine)Serzone (nefazodone), Zoloft (sertraline), Effexor (venlafaxine)\u2022 antihistamines \u0096 Hismanal (astemizole), Seldane (terfenadine)\u2022 antifungals \u0096 itraconazole (Sporanox), Ketoconazole (Nizoral)\u2022 gastrointestinal motility agents \u0096 Prepulsid (Cisapride)\u2022 ergot drugs \u0096 Ergonovine, Ergomar (ergotamine)\u2022 anti-psychotics \u0096 Clozaril (clozapine), Orap (pimozide)\u2022 sedatives/sleeping pills \u0096 Ambien (zolpidem), Halcion (triazolam), Versed (midazolam)\u2022 lipid-lowering drugs (statins) \u0096 Lescol (fluvastatin), Mevacor (lovastatin), Pravachol (pravastatin) and Zocor (simvastatin),Baycol (cerivastatin)\u2022 transplant drugs \u0096 cyclosporine (Neoral, Sandimmune), ProGraf (tacrolimus)Milk thistle also has the potential to lower levels of the following drugs:\u2022 anti-parasite drugs \u0096 Mepron (atovaquone)\u2022 sedatives/sleeping pills \u0096 Ativan (lorazepam)\u2022 hormones \u0096 estrogenThe research by the scientists in Pittsburgh should emphasize to readers that simply because a product is \"natural\" it does not mean it issafe when taken with other substances. This research also shows the need to conduct further research on herb-drug interactions on livercells as well as in people. Such studies may find combinations of herbs and drugs that can be safely used together. The Pittsburghresearchers noted that \"patients and health care professionals must be encouraged to discuss the use of herbs and be educated about thepotential interactions between herbs and drugs.\" This cannot be stressed enough.REFERENCEVenkataramanan R, Ramachandran V, Komoroski **, et al.

            "answer": "A Mug of Hot Cocoa Can Improve Artery Health in Patients With Type 2 DiabetesMichael O'RiordanMay 27, 2008 \u2014 The benefits of cocoa, known recently for its ability to reduce blood pressure and improve endothelial function, also extends to diabetic patients, a new study has shown [1]. In a small, randomized study, investigators showed that the consumption of a big mug of hot cocoa can reverse vascular dysfunction in patients with diabetes, suggesting a therapeutic potential of cocoa in this patient population.\"Our study clearly established improvements of endothelial function after regular consumption of flavanol-containing cocoa in patients with type 2 diabetes, highlighting the potential of flavanol-containing diets and underscoring the potential health benefit for reducing the risk of cardiovascular events in diabetic patients,\" write lead investigator Dr Jan Balzer (University Hospital RWTH, Aachen, Germany) and colleagues in the June 3, 2008 issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.The findings are just the latest in a string of studies showing the cardiovascular promise of foods like cocoa that contain flavanols. Flavanols are a subgroup of plant-derived phytochemicals known as flavonoids, and several studies have shown that flavanol-containing foods, including cocoa, certain fruits and vegetables, tea, and red wine, have beneficial effects on LDL oxidation, platelet aggregation, insulin sensitivity, endothelial function, and blood pressure.Effect of Flavanols in Diabetics UnknownDespite the existing data, however, studies on the effects of flavanols on the vasculature in diabetic patients were missing. Patients with type 2 diabetes, writes Balzer and colleagues, might receive particular benefit from flavanol-containing cocoa, because various observational studies have shown that lifestyle modifications are particularly important in the prevention of diabetes and its complications.The investigators performed two studies: a 10-patient feasibility study to determine the appropriate dosing, to assess safety and tolerability, and to measure the effect size of the intervention to calculate sample size of the efficacy study. In total, 44 patients with treated type 2 diabetes were enrolled in the randomized, double-blind, parallel-group efficacy study, with half allocated to the treatment arm of 321 mg of flavanols per dose three times daily. The control patients also received some flavanols, albeit a much smaller amount, about 25 mg per dose three times daily.Baseline flow-mediated dilation (FMD) values were 3.3% in both the treatment and control arms at the start of the intervention. The daily consumption of flavanol-containing cocoa by patients in the treatment arm resulted in continual increases in FMD, increasing from 3.3% at baseline to 4.1% on day 8 and to 4.3% by study completion on day 30. The investigators note that the acute effects of drinking cocoa in the treatment arm, those recorded two hours after ingestion, were of a similar effect size at study entry, day 8, and day 30, suggesting that patients did not become desensitized or immune to the effects of drinking cocoa.On day 30, the investigators report that the composite maximum increase in FMD--a combination of the chronic and acute effects of cocoa ingestion--was 5.8%, suggesting \"a reversal of endothelial dysfunction.\" This reversal in endothelial dysfunction with cocoa is comparable to intermediate- and long-term interventions using exercise and various medications, including insulin, pioglitazone, ACE inhibitors, and statins, write Balzer and colleagues.The high-flavanol cocoa used in this study--which provides much more flavanol than the typical US dietary intake of 20 to 100 mg daily--is not sold in the supermarket.The present study was not designed to determine the precise molecular mechanism by which flavanols improve endothelial function. However, the investigators point out that FMD of the brachial artery is almost entirely dependent on nitric oxide (NO) and that endothelial function measured by FMD is commonly used as a marker of endothelial NO synthesis.This proposed mechanism, they note, would make sense considering that recurrent and prolonged hyperglycemia in diabetic patients reduces NO bioavailability, which leads to endothelial dysfunction. In support of this hypothesis, Balzer and colleagues report no improvement in endothelium-independent vasodilation after the administration of nitroglycerin, which suggests that improvements in vascular function are secondary to the effects of treatment on endothelial function and NO bioavailability.A Promising New Dietary Intervention for Type 2 DiabetesIn an editorial accompanying the study, Drs Umberto Campia and Julio A Panza (Washington Hospital Center, Washington, DC) note that interest in the cardiovascular benefits of cocoa started with observations of the Kuna Indians [2]. This indigenous population in Panama consumes a large amount of cocoa rich in flavanols and, despite a diet that also has a large amount of salt, they have a very low prevalence of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and cancer compared with Kuna Indians living in Panama City.Campia and Panza write that because the endothelium plays a significant role in hypertension and atherosclerosis, research efforts have focused on the acute and chronic effects of cocoa, as well as other drinks and food, in the hope that their consumption could improve vascular function.One important question, the editorialists note, that this study answers pertains to previous concerns that nutrients in the diet of diabetic patients might not reach needed physiological levels due to secondary impairments in gastrointestinal function. That absorption concern is apparently unwarranted, as these data suggest flavanol intake in diabetics results in plasma levels consistent with those observed in nondiabetic patients. Second, this study also shows that FMD increased steadily and was maintained over time, \"suggesting a lack of significant desensitization or tolerance.\"The study, according to Campia and Pana, extends the understanding of the vascular effects of flavanols to diabetic patients, but more work is still needed. \"Although endothelial function has been shown to predict future cardiovascular events, randomized, large-scale clinical trials assessing relevant clinical outcomes are necessary before any recommendations are made regarding dietary supplementation with flavanol-rich cocoa,\" they write.Mars Inc provided the instant cocoa powder used in the preparation of cocoa drinks in the study.

            "answer": "Interesting and great to get the discussion away from MT. :-)As they say that one cannot buy the cocoa they used in the supermarkets, I am assuming that they are using raw cocoa, as roasting the cocoa beans destroys the antioxidants and probably also the flavanol, and renders it to be more like coffee.Raw cocoa, is considered a super food. It is supposed to have the highest antioxidant value of all the natural foods.I usually make raw chocolate from all raw ingredients and stir it 'warm', not heated.. Raw cocoa butter, cocoa powder, agave syrup, goji berries, carob powder and other stuff... and find that it gives me a total kick, when I eat it. It gives amazingly much energy.\u00a0\u00a0(am not eating any, since dx, as I'm staying away from the fat)Anyway, back to the subject... I don't understand why the study says, it lowers blood pressure.My usual blood pressure is 100/65, so I assume that if the cocoa gives me a kick, it theoretically must heighten my blood pressure??? Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it energizes in another way. But if it would lower blood pressure, wouldn't it make me feel tired?But i did not understand how it will be of use to Hep C. Well the antioxidants are definitely great. It mentions platelet aggregation, how does that translate?Marcia",

Platelets and leukocytes contribute to arterial thrombosis and to inflammatory processes. Previous studies performed in vitro have demonstrated inhibition of platelet function by (-)-epicatechin and (+)-catechin, flavan-3-ols (flavanols) that are present in several foods including some cocoas. Also, some modest inhibition of platelet function has been observed ex vivo after the consumption of flavanol-containing cocoa products by healthy adults. So far there are no reports of effects of cocoa flavanols on leukocytes. This paper summarizes 2 recent investigations. The first was a study of the effects of cocoa flavanols on platelet and leukocyte function in vitro. The second was a study of the effects of consumption of a flavanol-rich cocoa beverage by healthy adults on platelet and leukocyte function ex vivo. Measurements were made of platelet aggregation, platelet-monocyte conjugate formation (P/M), platelet-neutrophil conjugate formation (P/N), platelet activation (CD62P on monocytes and neutrophils), and leukocyte activation (CD11b on monocytes and neutrophils) in response to collagen and/or arachidonic acid. In the in vitro study several cocoa flavanols and their metabolites were shown to inhibit platelet aggregation, P/M, P/N, and platelet activation. Their effects were similar to those of aspirin and the effects of a cocoa flavanol and aspirin did not seem to be additive. There was also inhibition of monocyte and neutrophil activation by flavanols, but this was not replicated by aspirin. 4'-O-methyl-epicatechin, 1 of the known metabolites of the cocoa flavanol (-)-epicatechin, was consistently effective as an inhibitor of platelet and leukocyte activation. The consumption of a flavanol-rich cocoa beverage also resulted in significant inhibition of platelet aggregation, P/M and P/N, and platelet activation induced by collagen. The inhibitory effects were related to their flavanol content. There was also inhibition of monocyte and neutrophil activation, but here it was concluded that cocoa constituents other than flavanols may contribute to the inhibition that was observed. It can be concluded that cocoa flavanols, their metabolites and possibly other cocoa constituents can modulate the activity of platelets and leukocytes in vitro and ex vivo. The research suggests that the consumption of certain cocoa products may provide a dietary approach to maintaining or improving cardiovascular health.http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16794458",
