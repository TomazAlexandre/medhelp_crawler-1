            "answer": "Metformin, Synthroid and whatever you take for hypertension can all cause diarrhea (check Patient Information Leaflets). Now the question is if you can change any of them.If you're taking metformin, do it always with/after the meal, not on the empty stomach. Do this with other meds also, if not prescribed otherwise.Try to identify foods that aggravate diarrhea. Consider- dairy, especially if you have lactose intolerance- fruits and anything containing fructose, sorbitol, polyols found in low-calorie foods or diet sodas, HFCS), especially if you have fructose malabsorption- fibre-rich foods like legumes- sugary foods- other (by experience)Nutrients from all above mentioned foods can actually drag water into intestine and cause diarrhea. Search for lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption.",

    "question": "I have taken a large amount of medications over the last 20 years: Depakote ER, Remeron, antipsychotic for short time, Hydrochlorothiazide, Atenenol, Trileptal, Luvox, Synthroid, Tiazac, Lipiter, insulin and some others. I have struggled most of this time with uncontrolable diarreahea.\u00a0\u00a0Eventually I started taking Imodium AD which helped to some extent.\u00a0\u00a0After a colonoscopy and tests for anything that shouldn't exist in the colon, ie: parasites etc. my surgeon told me my problem was all the meds I was taking (it was enough to kill me) that my colon is healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Working with my other doctors I have reduced a number of the meds without harm.\u00a0\u00a0I am still on meds for Diabetes, for Hypertension, and for Low Thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Generally, I am in good health, physically and mentally active.However, I still suffer the diarreahea that comes in fits after I eat a meal and often when I am out shopping, or walking for excercise.\u00a0\u00a0I find the Imodium helpful to some extent, but I can never be sure it is enough to prevent sudden bouts of the diarreahea.\u00a0\u00a0I drink plenty of water daily to prevent dehydration and eat conservative meals.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost 30 pounds intentionally as I was overweight due to medications.\u00a0\u00a0There is no blood or \"fats\" in the stools.\u00a0\u00a0They are a normal medium brown in color, sometimes they have been very dark almost black.\u00a0\u00a0Seldom have I appreciated a solid stool.\u00a0\u00a0I have searched the internet regarding IBS, IB, Colitis, etc. and have yet to find my symptoms of anything to match.\u00a0\u00a0It is as though I have too much water in the colon to be absorbed normally and everything just washes out at its own will.\u00a0\u00a0If you have any thoughts regarding this matter, I would greatly appreciate them and anything I can do to correct my problem.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
