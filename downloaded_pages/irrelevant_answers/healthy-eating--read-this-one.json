    "question": "I am 5 weeks pregnant. This will be my second pregnancy. The first ended in miscarriage. My bestfriend is 39 weeks pregnant with absolutely no problems at all. She's overweight, only eats junk food, drinks soda non stop, and never exercises. Yet her baby is perfectly healthy. I can't help but be jealous. How did she get so lucky? This pregnancy I'm trying to cut out soda completely and try my best to eat fruits and vegetables. It ***** to see how easily my friend has it. I watch her devour Oreos and Pepsi with no concern while I'm scared to death to eat one cookie. I just am so frustrated and jealous.",
