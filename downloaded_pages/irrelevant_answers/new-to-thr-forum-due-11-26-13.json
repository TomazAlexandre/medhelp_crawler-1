Its helpful to read what other mamas are feeling & knowing many have the same questions or concerns is very comforting!This is our 3rd and although quite a suprise..we're excited and nervous. Our youngest (whose 10) was 7 weeks preemie due to severe HELLP/GD..and the diabetes has returned this time prior to pregnancy. Wish us luck<3All my best thoughts for all you!",
