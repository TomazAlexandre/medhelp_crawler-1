            "answer": "If the lab tech said something like \"insulin resistant.\"\u00a0\u00a0Most doctors have stopped calling it insulin resistance and they refer to it an \"metabolic syndrome.\"\u00a0\u00a0It has a few diagnostic indicators:\u00a0\u00a0elevated fasting glucose, elevated hemoglobin A1C, waist > 40\" in males or >35\" in females, decreased levels of HDL, etc.\u00a0\u00a0I don't remember the whole list.It is normally considered \"pre-Type 2 Diabetes.\" and there is quite a bit that can be done with diet, exercise,\u00a0\u00a0weight loss, etc.\u00a0\u00a0As far as I know, there is no causal linkage between MS and Metabolic Syndrome or Type II Diabetes (other than maybe the increased weight and \"spread\" that can come with decreased mobility, pain, depression that seems to come with MS.)\u00a0\u00a0MS itself would not be a \"direct cause\" to \"metabolic syndrome.\"Bob",
