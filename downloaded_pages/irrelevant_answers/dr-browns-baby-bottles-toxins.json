            "answer": "I hope this info helps.\u00a0\u00a0I too have a 6 mos old and I was freaked out when I found out (we use Dr. Brown's).A new study by an environmental group has parents on edge after researchers found some popular baby bottles leach potentially harmful levels of a toxic chemical known to link developmental, neural, and reproductive problems.The Environment California Research and Policy Center found that the plastic material used in the bottle breaks down through use and releases bisphenol A into liquids and foods.Five brands of bottles were tested: Avent, Dr. Brown's, Evenflo, Gerber and Playtex. All five leached bisphenol A at levels \"found to cause harm in numerous laboratory animal studies,\" said Environment California spokeswoman Rachel Gibson.Bisphenol A has been linked by scientists to cancers, impaired immune function, early onset of puberty, obesity, diabetes and hyperactivity, Gibson said.Prior to the release of the study, members of the National Institutes of Health reviewed the data. They are expected to meet next week to review the issue.Meanwhile, the chemicals industry says this week's report is simply a rehash of an old controversy and also said the test used by Environment California Research and Policy Center was flawed.\"The bottles were heated with water for 24 hours at 80 degrees centigrade, hardly relevant conditions for how baby bottles are actually used,\" Steven Hentges, executive director of the Polycarbonate/BPA Global Group of the American Chemistry Council. \"Had the bottles been tested under relevant use conditions, as has been done by many other researchers, the level of bisphenol A would have been much lower if detected at all.\"The Institute for Agriculture has some recommendations for concerned parents.

Safer alternatives for both are bottles and/or \"sippy\" cups made of polypropylene or polyethylene.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------Bottles to AvoidAventDr. Brown",

    "question": "Could someone please shed some more light on the recent baby bottle controversy. I am so nervous since reading the post about them possibly leaking cancer causing toxins.My DD is 6 months old and that is all I have ever used and I have always washed them in very hot water( dishwasher) Did they give suggestions on which type of bottles to buy??? I really want to go out tomorrow and get new bottles, do y'all think this is necessary???",
