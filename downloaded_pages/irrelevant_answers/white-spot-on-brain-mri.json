            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Yes, focal dystonia is a possibility. Some doctors treat it by botox injections which\u00a0\u00a0give symptomatic relief. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Yes, if you had neck injuries in the past, a neck MRI should be done to rule out spinal nerve compression.Hope this helps. Take care!",

            "answer": "Hi Doctor Nee,Thanks so much for the quick response. I'm planning to have a physical and I will ask my doctor to do these tests.I have been very stressed and fatigued and it does get worse then. But I feel this may be neck related or FD as he thinks.I'm wondering if physical therapy would help also?",

    "question": "Hello Everyone,This is my first post here. I have been having twitching in fingers on my right hand for over a year now I went to aNeurologist who did eeg and nerve conducting tests which ruled out Lou Gherrig's disease and other moresevere possible causes. My brain MRI had a white spot which he says is due to my having migraines. I'm guessinghe is correct, but part of me still wonders if this anything I need to worry about. What do you think?He believes the twitching is caused by Focal Dystonia, but he didn't recommend any treatments for this.I will also be doing a neck MRI as I had neck and back injuries and this could be another possible cause.",
