            "answer": "Hi there....most important is for us to see what your most recent lab results were. And to make sure you had a Free T4, Free T3 and TSH done together.Normal range doesn't mean normal for a Hashi patient. Your TSH should be supressed to between a .50-1.0 if you are on T4 meds only. Your free t4 should be mid normal range and your free t3 should be mid to high normal range....If not optimal with your ranges and your Dr allows you to be just anywhere in the normal, then you can remain sick and have all types of symptoms.Please post your results with labs.\u00a0\u00a0:)",

    "question": "I have hashimotos's and off and on for years now have had a problem with chronic uticaria and angioedema. I can go for long periods and not have any problems, but once it starts it lasts for months...and recently lasted for a year. I now have the hives again as well as angioedema. I have to take Zyrtec daily if I want to avoid it and even then I can still have some.I am on 88 mcg. of Levoxyl M-F and 75 mcg on Saturday. I also have Type 2 diabetes but am not on medication...it is controlled by diet and exercise. I see the same Endo for both and she adjusts my Levoxyl according to my T3, T4 and TSH levels.I have been to severla Allergist over the years and no one has ever been able to give me a reason...they all say chronic uticaria of unknown origin.I have been reading online and they say that it could be associated with Hashimotos...please tell me what other testing I could have done as this is making me crazy! I also had her run a Celiac panel as I read that could cause hives and I do have stomach issues from time to time. The Celiac panel was normal.I would appreciate any suggestions.Thank you",
