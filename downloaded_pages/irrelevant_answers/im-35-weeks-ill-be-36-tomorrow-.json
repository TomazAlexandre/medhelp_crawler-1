            "answer": "Shoulder screening is an assessment Web based questionaire they ask a bunch of question such as, is this your 1st pregnancy, pre-weight & height which they have on file, glucose test passed or failed, gestational diabetes,age which I'm 31 so based on these silly questions this web-based program could estimate if the baby will have wide shoulders and if that's the case they assume that at delivery once the baby's head I'd out he or she might have trouble or their shoulders might be stuck and could cause shoulder dystocia. In other words it's an assessment to make sure that I know that c section might be an option. Personally I think it's stupid it's very new and vague.",
