            "answer": "I understand why you are freaking out - I was freaking out then, too.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes runs in my family, too, so I immediately thought the worst case scenario (I'm blessed with anxiety!).\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I wasn't told to eat as much as possible.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, I grilled the nurse who called me with my first test results on how to possibly affect the second test.\u00a0\u00a0She was adamant in telling me that if I have GD, there's nothing I can do to affect the test.\u00a0\u00a0She then told me to eat normally until the fasting.\u00a0\u00a0But, if I was just borderline as my first results suggested, and not truly GD, then I MAY be able to affect the results by curbing my carbs and sugar intake the few days beforehand.\u00a0\u00a0I haven't heard the gorging to stretch the pancreas - maybe someone else has?\u00a0\u00a0I wish I knew more about that one.\u00a0\u00a0When I tested positive the first test, I checked in on the forum, and lots of ladies curbed their carbs and sugar beforehand and nobody mentioned the eating lots to stretch the pancreas.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe you want to ask the nurse at your facility?\u00a0\u00a0Instead of asking the Dr. again.\u00a0\u00a0Again, the worst case scenario is a worst case scenario - you know nothing until you take the test, so it'll only drive you crazy to worry yourself like this.\u00a0\u00a0Just find the sensible thing to do to prepare and the rest is really up to nature.\u00a0\u00a0I know it's easy for me to say now, since I passed the second one, but I had to talk myself through that test to keep my sanity.\u00a0\u00a0The people I know who ended up with GD do not and have not developed diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The vast majority don't develop it.\u00a0\u00a0Rely on odds to make yourself feel better. You WILL be ok :)",

            "answer": "Hi! First, take a deep breath, because it is going to be ok.\u00a0\u00a0I failed the first test, too.\u00a0\u00a0Then, I passed the 3 hour test.\u00a0\u00a0My first test was borderline, but not on the scale you mentioned: mine was 139, and the cutoff was 134.\u00a0\u00a0So, anyway, many many people fail the first test, and it's quite normal to do so.\u00a0\u00a0The second test is a fasting test (it was for me), so try to schedule it for early in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0They take your blood four times.\u00a0\u00a0Once before the glucose drink and then three times after that - once every hour.\u00a0\u00a0Hence, the three hour test. Anyway, if you end up having GD, it can be bad for you and/or your baby, if you do not do what you are told - ie: eat what they want you to eat.\u00a0\u00a0It can make for a large baby, which could be hard on you, too.\u00a0\u00a0BUT, this doesn't mean you have GD.\u00a0\u00a0You COULD but maybe not, depending on the test.\u00a0\u00a0And if you have GD, it's not bad for you or the baby, unless you don't do what the nutritionist advises you to do, which is eat what they tell you to eat.\u00a0\u00a0Most cases of GD will go away after you deliver, and a small percentage of folks will develop diabetes later in life - small percentage, though.\u00a0\u00a0All in all, do the fasting right, and you may not have it.\u00a0\u00a0I also lowered my carb and sugar intake a few days before the test to see if I could affect it.\u00a0\u00a0The nurse did tell me, though, that if you have GD, you can't affect it - you have it.\u00a0\u00a0If you do not, then you can certainly lower your results by the fast and lowering carbs.\u00a0\u00a0It's not the worst thing in the world - it's just something to be monitored. I wish you the best of luck and please let us know how you are.",

            "answer": "I also failed the screening but passed the 3 hour test fine. I was worried but the test wasn't a big deal. Also if you still fail the 3 hour test, often simple changes like seeing a nutritionist to plan your food better and exercising help and it often goes away after pregnancy. If you require meds or it continues past pregnancy, again treatment is helpful and good to do for both you and baby. I know friends who have had this but in their cases it went away as soon as baby was born.",

            "answer": "I did have this happen to me. Plus a couple other things. My Dr. was a real well, nevermind... ALL the time. I hope you don't have G.D. because it was So hard on me. But if you do, I hope that your Dr. will treat you better than mine did me. In my opinion, no one deserves to go through that, especially not while pregnant. If you do have it, your Dr. Will have you meet with a dietician, and the dietician will tell you what you can and can't eat, tell you no sweets, cut back your calorie and fats and carb. intake. Good Luck!!!",
