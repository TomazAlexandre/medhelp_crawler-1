            "answer": "HiI am not sure whether you stated this medication on your own or were advised to take it for weight loss. The drug has many side effects. Please refer: http://epilepsy.emedtv.com/topamax/topamax-side-effects.htmlHence it is not advisable to take this drug unless really needed. One has to weigh the pros and cons of such medications.If you are overweight then there are many medical conditions like hypothyroidism and diabetes that you should rule out. You could consult a weight trainer and chalk out an exercise regimen to help control weight. A good dietician should be able to come up with a diet plan based on your body metabolism and stature o help you reduce weight.Please think carefully before resorting to medication as the way to reduce weight. In case you continue to take this medication, please let your doctor know about glaucoma.Please let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted.",

The Dr. had said it looked like I had a slight developing of glaucoma forming in my right eye. Should I continue this med, or counsult my physician first? Now, the positive thing I do like about this topamax\u00a0\u00a0their is a lot of feedback as far as the weight loss part of it. This is really what I am more interested in taking it for.",
