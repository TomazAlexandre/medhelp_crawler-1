It sounds like your risk is almost 0.\u00a0\u00a0I don't even think there's a need to get tested but to answer your other question...A test at 2 weeks wouldn't be conclusive, but if you took a DUO test which tests for antigens and antibodies it would be highly favorable if it came out negative.\u00a0\u00a0If testing only for antibodies wait 4-6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0Plenty of people will argue with me here and say 12 weeks I'm sure.\u00a0\u00a0Sift through the Dr's forums here, and you'll find plenty of info on the chances of testing positive if you have HIV after 4 weeks / 6 weeks etc...",

    "question": "I am currently pregnant, married, and in a 100% monogamous heterosexual relationship, and as of my most recent HIV test in October 2007, my HIV status is negative.\u00a0\u00a0During my pregnancy, I had a 1 hour test for gestational diabetes which I failed.\u00a0\u00a0At work, a co-worker (mid 50's heterosexual married male with diabetes) allowed me to use his glucose test kit so I could examine my blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0I cleaned my fingers with alcohol before he used his lancet to stick my finger, and obviously drew a tiny drop of blood.\u00a0\u00a0I am sure it is my pregnant hormones working overtime, but is there a possibility that (assuming this individual is HIV positive, which I believe to be unlikely) I could have contracted the virus if he did not switch the lancet to a fresh one before he stuck my finger to test my blood sugar?\u00a0\u00a0He has the type of kit where the lancet is able to be re-used for finger-sticking purposes.\u00a0\u00a0This incident occurred 2 weeks ago - should I go for a rapid test, and will it be accurate?\u00a0\u00a0Did swabbing my fingers with alcohol before he stuck me kill the virus?",
