            "answer": "To me, it sounds like you might have a food allergy or IBS.IBS is Irritable Bowel Syndrome. Basically, your nervous system likes to freak out your GI tract when you eat certain foods. The food trigers are different for everyone, so you might want to experiment and see what you do and don't get sick from. Symptoms include cramping, bloating, diarrhea, constipation, nasuea, and sometimes vomitting.Track your symptoms for a few days with a journal. When you have these episodes, what you ate, what exactly happened. It's gross to write down how you go to the bathroom and the pain you feel, but it really helps the doctor.If it is IBS, don't worry. You change your diet a little, and when you do have an episode, make sure you drink tons of water so you don't get dehydranted. You can never really get rid of it, but you can limit how many attacks you have once you masterit. Don't take any medications---perscriptions or OTC---without talkign to your doctor. NEVER take laxatives or anti-diarretics, or you can really hurt yourself. I have IBS myself, and it's pretty easy to handle once you know your body.Try talking to the IBS boards or GI boards, either doctors or the general forums, on here. They're a lot of help.I hope this helps, and please keep me posted!~ Em",
