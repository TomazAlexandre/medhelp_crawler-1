            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A high CRP HS usually indicates a heart pathology provided you are absolutely healthy. If CRP is normal then the possibility of a heart pathology is more or less ruled out. If diabetes status and lipid profile are normal, then the high CRPHS is due to inflammation. This can be due to low Vit D also and this can also be the cause of body aches.Unexplained aches and pains coming on and off could also be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD/menopause.Please consult your PCP for primary examination followed by proper referral.Take care!",

            "answer": "What a relief to find this site and all your postings. My symptoms began about 6 mos. ago with recurring burning, tearing pain in my left index finger end joint when extending my arm and bending the finger, usually while reaching for something or picking something up. The pain is excruciating. Amazing how many others are experiencing this. It has coincided with increasing pain and weakness in both basal thumb joints, severly limiting my hand dexterity and strength. I am a 65 yr. old woman in good physical condition otherwise, but was diagnosed with lupus and fibromyalgia in 1992. I have been tested for Lymes twice and both times resutls were negative. NSAIDS have kept my symptoms under control until the last year or so - now they no longer work. I've been told that surgery can improve the basal thumb joint weakness, but it looks like we just have to live with adhesions and tearings of the scar tissue around old injuries. From this site it seems like these symptoms are widespread enough that there would more information out there, doesn't it?",
