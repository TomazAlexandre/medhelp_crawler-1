            "answer": "You don't want to get gestational diabetes so try to cut back on the sweets. It was hard for me as well because all I wanted ever was mint chocolate chip ice cream. Everyone's pregnancy is different though and some people get different symptoms. It doesn't mean that anything is wrong it just means that your body reacts differently. When I first found out I was pregnant I was eating a ton! Then the morning sickness kicked in and I was still always hungry but I couldn't eat anything because I would want to throw it up. The dizziness could be lack of iron so you may want to look into that with your doctor. I was always dizzy during my pregnancy and trying to pass out weird places and it was because I had pregnancy anemia.",

    "question": "Ok, since my 6th week ( im now 8 weeks) i have been having these cravings for reeses cups. it has gotten to the point where i have to eat at least 1 pack ( king sized) and 1 pack ( regular) every day. Lately ive been gettin 2 king sized packs and 4 regular packs and eaten them all. Also, my appetite has increased, and ive been eating alot more than i did prepregnancy. Which is weird cuz alot of girls in their 1st trimester usuallt have a LOSS of appetite. All my pregnancy symptoms seem to be OVERexaggerated. Like instead of being just fatigued, im dead on my feet, instead of having morning sickness, i feel like ive got the stmach flu. Also ive had really bad dizzyness, like i get a dizzy spell and i almost faint. So here is my first question1. How can i satisfy these cravings and my appetite, without overdooing it, and without eating a bunch of junk?Second Question:2.Why are my pregnancy symptoms so overexaggerated? Has anyone else been thru this?",
