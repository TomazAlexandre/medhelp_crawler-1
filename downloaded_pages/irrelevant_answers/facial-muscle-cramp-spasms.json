    "question": "I have looked on the web about this but have come up empty as to anything regarding facial cramps or spasms. Occasionally, when I yawn or move my face in a contorted way it sticks in that position for a brief moment. I remember back to my mother saying \"Your face will stick that way\" and think out loud \"She was right!\" When I have leg cramps I talked to a Pharmacist, they said I lack Potassium. So I have been on a quest to get more in my system. I eat Pineapple and or drink Pineapple juice. The juice can lists 240mg/serving 6 oz serving. Is this enough? The spasms have lessened in my face. Then I notice I get them in my toes and the ball of my feet, typically at night when I get to bed.About me: I am 47 yo, Type II Diabetic, maleMy blood aunt had facial tics and twiches. It was hard to talk to her growing up and I worry I will get these as I age.",
