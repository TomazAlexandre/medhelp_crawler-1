            "answer": "I am unable to understand the reason behind getting fasting glucose levels at borderline that ususally comes 5.2. After breakfast it is toally controlled (<6.2-6.8) though 1h after lunch I ususally get readings <7.2-7.8. Another thing I also notice if the blood drop flows freely results are good as well as when you work little hard to get a big drop it fails with erratic and high readings.",

    "question": "Hi: I have been diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 29 weeks, this is my 32 week. I am trying to control my glucose levels with highly restricted diet and some exercise. So far I succeeded but sometimes readings come very erratic, another problem is my fasting glucose levels which always come on border ie <5.2. Usually when I get abnormal reading at 1hr I again do at 2hr. I am really puzzled how to overcome this problem, is this also common with other women?Thanks",
