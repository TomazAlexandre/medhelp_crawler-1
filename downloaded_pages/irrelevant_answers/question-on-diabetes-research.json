    "question": "HI,I am sorry to bother the staff here again, but i have another few questions:1)Where can i find up-to-date true research updates on diabetes?2)From what your staff know, when is the \"spray insulin\" coming to the market?3)Are there \"Lantus pens\" in the U.S.?4)In your opinion, what is the best, most convenient and fastest glucose meter?5)Are you aware of any type of research being done to produce insulin from the liver?This is going to sound crazy, but here is my dream invention:It will be an insulin pump which constantly checks your blood sugar, if it feels it is going low it will inject glucose before it even has a chance to reach below 80mg, if it feels that the blood is going high it will inject insulin before it reaches 120mg. This machine will calculate exactly how much you ate in your meal, because a tiny blue tooth infrared camera which will be planted in your stomach will transmit info of exactly what went in to your system. This type of glucose which will be in the pump will get into your entire bloodstream within seconds, and you will not feel any symptoms.This would be an electronic pancreas!If NASA could invent a spaceship they could definitely invent this little thing!What do you think?",
