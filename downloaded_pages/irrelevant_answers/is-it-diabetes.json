            "answer": "The 200 mg readings before a meal seem quite high for it to be just pre-diabetes .You say you measured his blood sugar so does it mean there are other members of the family who are diabetic ?\u00a0\u00a0Anyhow, I would get\u00a0\u00a0second opinion based on the readings you describe.",

            "answer": "The readings you posted are abnormal, not normal. Try to get an appointment with an Endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in diabetes care as his current doctor doesn't seem to care or doesn't have enough knowledge to treat diabetes.Ask for an A1c test which measure blood glucose over the past 2-3 months. Continue testing premeal (prandial) and 2-3 hours after meals (postprandial). This provides a good insight on foods that affect his glucose levels. Limit carb intake and white foods; potatoes, rice, white bread or anything made with white flour. These turn into sugar after eating.",

            "answer": "yes, there's a lot of Diabetics in my family but none on his. I don't think these readings are normal but I wanted to know what other people thought. The 200 something was about 2 hrs after meal. Thank you everybody.",

            "answer": "Type 2 Diabetes is a diet & lifestyle related illness. Most people put the blame on the Sugar and Carbohydrate for the elevated glucose level in the blood. Actually, it is not the 'sweetness' of the modern diet that causes Type 2 Diabetes, it is the Acidic by-products that accumulated in the cellular environment that hinder the function on insulin to bring in glucose into the cells for energy production or storage. This condition is commonly known as Insulin Resistance. Type 2 Diabetes is not because of lack of Insulin but the inability of insulin to perform its task to open up the glucose channels into the cells and when the glucose cannot enter the cells, it bounce back into the bloodstream and causes hyperglycemia.",

    "question": "My husband has been feeling tired, sleepy and thirsty for about a month. I checked his sugar for about a week and went to see our fam dr. He said everything was fine. 2weeks later, I checked his sugar for about a week again.He has some normal readings but he also have some few high readings and that's before meals like 149, 163, 2 on the 200s, etc. family dr. keeps saying that this is normal for his age (60) that he's working too hard or too much. Is that true that it's normal or could this be pre-diabetes?",
