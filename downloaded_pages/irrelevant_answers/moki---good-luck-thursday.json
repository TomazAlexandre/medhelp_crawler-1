            "answer": "Thanks for all the well wishes. My appt was interesting...not sure what to think yet. I have been given \"for now\" the Dx of paroxysmal dyskinesia dystonia. When I googled it this afternoon, I find that it occurs in childhood and would account only for my spasms. Discussion of treatment included botox injections (ruled out since I have opposing muscles that both spasm and so many muscles that spasm that it is simply not a reasonable choice), a med whose name I cannot recall but has dreadful side effects similar tot he bad experiences I've had in the past. She even mentioned deep brain stimulation (in jest I am sure...I am nowhere near that point - used in extreme cases). For now we settled on doubling my baclofen to see if there is any relief.The fact that I have been sliding into a remission of sorts doesn't help. She said we won't really know what will work until I \"relapse\". She looked very closely at my videotaped spasms. Did try to blame many of my symptoms on the diabetes - I kept reminding that I have had the symptoms for 2 years and the diabetes for a few months. My glucose was tested many times and found to be fine through March of this year. Tried using BPPV to explain the balance although shown not to have it.A test for stiff man syndrome and myriad other blood tests done. So I guess the appt was a mixed bag. I go back in January unless needed sooner. At least I am finally taken seriously though!!!!My ophthalmologist appt yesterday was also a mixed bag. There is likely no permanent damage to my eyes from the extended high glucose. However, it is expected to take a month of normal sugars for my vision to return (not quite normal yet, although they are finally coming down, thanks to another increase in insulin dose). Sooooo...I may have to go on leave. My PCP will not release me back to work \"until I can see\". The eye spec. does not feel it a good idea to mess around with other glasses during this period. Maybe he can pay my mortgage - what do you think? LOLMoki - how'd your appt go?Penn",

I know this is not resolved (the tentative Dx is a childhood condition usually manifested by age 15 - and some say I'm too old for MS, lol!), but at least someone's paying attention now.Can you tell Moki I'm thinking of her and her Dad?
