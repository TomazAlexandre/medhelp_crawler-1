            "answer": "Echo does not show arrythmias...In anycase, I suffer from mild left ventricular dysfunction,ejection fraction at 50%These symptoms are accompanied with abnormal excessivepangs, surge of what I think is either adrenaline or insulin orcortisol or whatever other catecholamines, whooziness, dizziness,faintlike symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I believe its some kind of metabolic imbalance,which could be related to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Certain foods such as pinto beansalleviate those symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes theory itself is skewed, little understood, the debate rages on.The question is why is not the holter monitor picking these up?\u00a0\u00a0Could it be they are spams, or could it be the readings are misinterpretated?\u00a0\u00a0Could it be that holter monitors catch only certain type arrythmias, it could be that the vibrating sensation is not arrythmia, but some kind of muscle fasciculations which is happening in the heart...could be lack of a certain mineral or nutrients, could be so many things.In any case, its definitely happening, because, at times, it vibrates so strongly, its actually visible..",

    "question": "Feel the heart literally vibrating, with dizziness, fainting,associated with hunger pangs, feeling really ill.Holter monitor showed nothing!!Serum blood glucose was normal.Those vibrating feelings in the heart are constant, and sometimesfeel as if blacking out.I don't believe that holter monitors catch all types of arrythmias,or those in the atrium, or what I am feeling, such as some type ofheart spasm which is not electrical but rather depleted of a nutrient,affecting the heart in particular, just as a muscle will fibrillate..Your input appreciated.",
