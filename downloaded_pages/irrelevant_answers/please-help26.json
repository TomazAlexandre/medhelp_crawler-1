            "answer": "I wake up almost every night sweating. Are you on any anti depressants? My sweating all started when I started taking Lexapro. It's all around my chest and neck area. It also causes really strange dreams. I went through a period when I thought I had type 2 Diabetes. I'm now at the age my mom was when she found out she had it. As for the weight, have you been doing more outside seasonal work? My husband lost 9 lbs. in a month since he started cutting the grass.HA really bites. I've had it for almost 8 years now and I can't even count the diseases I though I've had. Oh and I just remembered I used to wake up having panic attacks. I would wake up covered in sweat from them. I wish you the best of luck with you blood work.",

            "answer": "I think Litha_26 is right, also you need to start now at trusting what your Dr. says , also remember that when we self Dx ourselves we are only getting a fools answer (not to sound mean, just reminding you. Don't 2nd guess what your Dr. says, also why rack up bills if your not going to trust answers, it may seem hard to realize that you may just have mild anxiety, we all want to pinpoint it to other things (makes it easier) try to ask yourself whats going on, write what you feel see what comes out. good luck on your blood work!",

    "question": "Hping someone can help me out.\u00a0\u00a0I posted earlier but no answers.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having some issues that i believe to be anxiety related.\u00a0\u00a0I have been having trouble sleeping, I have dreams about being lost, having a disease, missing my train etc. I also wake up sweating\u00a0\u00a0a few times a nite, not drenching sweats but enough to wake me up. The sweating is mainly around my neck and upper chest.\u00a0\u00a0When i get them i get up and get a glass of water and its gone in 2 mins.\u00a0\u00a0I also tend to obsess about something being\u00a0\u00a0wrong medically.\u00a0\u00a0For example, a few weeks ago I ate something really acidic and it did a number on my tongue.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the dentist a few days after and he said that there was nothing wrong.\u00a0\u00a0A few days after the visit it still wasnt 100% and i noticed bumps in the back and my tongue looked white.\u00a0\u00a0I went to another doctor and she said everything is normal and to relax.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say i havent been able to.\u00a0\u00a0I freak out over the slightest thing. Like today i was putting my belt\u00a0\u00a0on and was able to get an extra hole in it.\u00a0\u00a0I started thinking that i have lost weight and why was i losing it, when i havent changed my eating habits.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to have blood work doen tomorrow for type 2 diabetes which runs in my family and getting a physical next week.\u00a0\u00a0Has anyone experienced this or now how i can at least sleep better?\u00a0\u00a0any help would be appreciated.",
