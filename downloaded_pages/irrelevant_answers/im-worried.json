    "question": "Hey I'm a 19 year old guy. Today i was playing with some kind of needle that my dad uses to pinch his finger to check his sugar level or something like that, since he has diabetes. Honestly i didn't even know it was a needle because it had some kind of little cap on it, it is not even the size of a sewing needle, it's less than an inch. Well while i had it in my hand the little cap came off and i got pinched with it, the cut wasn't deep, but then when blood started coming out my dad started joking around with AIDS stuff, saying stuff like he doesn't protect himself when he has sex with other women, and that really made me worry. The needle had been there for about 3 months and\u00a0\u00a0I don't know if he's been using it because he has more of those tiny needles, at least i know he hadn't used it in the past 30 minutes. I'm not sure if he's really infected with HIV because he doesn't take any medications for that, but let's say he had the virus, is there a high risk i got infected too?",
