    "question": "Sometimes (although quite often recently) when I'm hungry my tummy and thighs itch, and I tremble. I also feel a little \"on edge\", maybe, and makes me unable to concentrate on anything.Although it's not so much when I'm hungry, more when I haven't eaten for a while or haven't eaten much.This will continue until I eat something, usually something sweet like chocolate or a banana (well, actually two bananas).I've tried searching but\u00a0\u00a0I can't find any explanation for it, not for the two symptoms together.",
