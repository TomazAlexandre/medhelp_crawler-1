            "answer": "The person to best answer that question is you.\u00a0\u00a0How are you feeling?\u00a0\u00a0Do you notice having any hypo symptoms?\u00a0\u00a0Symptom relief should be all important, not just test results.\u00a0\u00a0Test results are valuable mainly as indicators during diagnosis and then afterward to track Free T3 and Free T4 as meds are revised to relieve symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0Since you have Hashi's, there will be an ongoing need to adjust meds as your thyroid glands are gradually destroyed by the thyroid antibodies.Your doctor did not apparently run tests for Free T3 and Free T4, which are the biologically active thyroid hormones.\u00a0\u00a0The tests for Total T4 and T3 uptake and T$ Index are somewhat outdated and not nearly as useful as the tests for Free T3 and T4.\u00a0\u00a0FT3 largely regulates metaboism and many other body functions.\u00a0\u00a0Studies have also shown that FT3 correlated best with hypo symptoms, while FT4 and TSH correlated very poorly.A good thyroid doctor will treat a patient clinically (for symptoms), by testing and adjusting Free T3 and Free T4 levels as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Remember, symptom relief is all important.I suggest that you should request testing for Free T3 and Free T4, along with TSH.\u00a0\u00a0If your doctor resists, then you should insist on it and don't take no for an answer.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure they test for the Free T3 and T4, not Total T3 andT4.\u00a0\u00a0While you are there you need to also find out if the doctor is willing to treat you clinically, as I described above.\u00a0\u00a0If not, then you are going to have to find a good thyroid doctor that will do so.",

            "answer": "Be aware that not all Endos are good thyroid doctors.\u00a0\u00a0Many specialize in diabetes, not thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0Also many have the \"Immaculate TSH Belief\"\u00a0\u00a0and only want to use TSH for diagnosis and treatment.\u00a0\u00a0If they test beyond TSH, frequently they use \"Reference Range Endocrinology\"\u00a0\u00a0and tell you that any test result that falls within the reference range is adequate, even if it is only in the low end\u00a0\u00a0of the range.\u00a0\u00a0Either of these two practices tend to leave hypo patients with lingering hypo symptoms.If you want to read more about clinical treatment, try this link to a letter written by a good thyroid doctor for patients that he is consulting with from a distance.\u00a0\u00a0The letter is sent to the PCP of the patient to help guide treatment.http://hormonerestoration.com/files/ThyroidPMD.pdfRather than wait and assume the Endo might be a good thyroid doctor, you might try a method I have used frequently to try and determine if a doctor is a prospect rather than a suspect.\u00a0\u00a0I call and tell them I am interested in making an appointment, but would like to ask a nurse two questions first.\u00a0\u00a0This almost always works to get a nurse on the line.\u00a0\u00a0then I ask if the doctor is willing to treat a patient clinically by testing and adjusting Free T3 and Free T4 as necessary to relieve symptoms, without being constrained by resultant TSH levels.\u00a0\u00a0Then I also ask if the doctor is willing to prescribe meds with T3 in them.\u00a0\u00a0If either answer is no, then you might as well keep on looking for a good thyroid doctor.",

I had been seen him since 1993, My biggest concern is that I haven't take any Levoxil for a year and a half, my new appt is for Aug-3. Iam going to call them on Monday and ask for those questions to the nurse. My last dosage was .88 of levoxil .Iam really worried to see him after all this time...",
