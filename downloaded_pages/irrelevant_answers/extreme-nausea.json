    "question": "for the past 8 months I'll randomly get extreme nausea. it always happens in the middle of the night except for when I first started getting it. sometimes I'll also have violent shaking (before, during or after) that's uncontrollable. lately I've just been taking tums and it's been working fine until just recently. now these periods are lasting longer and it's effecting my schedule. also I haven't ever actually vomited. Does anybody know what this might be? and should I go to a doctor?",
