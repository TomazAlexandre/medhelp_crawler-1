            "answer": "Kaz - crying after a nap is not normal,\u00a0\u00a0but you're describing a child who isn't awake when he's doing this - sounds like a sleep disorder associated with \"night terrors\" - except his occur during the daytime.\u00a0\u00a0If he's crying and he doesn't \"see you\" - it doesn't sound like he's awake.Does he have trouble with food textures?\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes kids with sensory defensiveness have difficulty coordinating chewing and swallowing,\u00a0\u00a0so they want to drink all their calories - milk and juice.\u00a0\u00a0So they go to the bathroom all the time,\u00a0\u00a0because they're drinking their calories.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0If your son isn't drinking water,\u00a0\u00a0but liquids with calories,\u00a0\u00a0it seems like this may be the case.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "It does sound like possible juvenile diabetes. I would definately make an appt with his pediatrician right away to rule it out. 3 1/2 sounds a bit old to be crying like that after a nap. The cake incident could be just behavioral. If he is a picky eater he could be getting too hungry between meals. This could cause bad behavior. If it is JD, you want to treat it right away to prevent permanent damage to his eyes or organs. If it's not, then at least you've ruled out the worst.",

    "question": "My 3 1/2 years old boy is starting to worry me.\u00a0\u00a0He constantly asks for something to drink.\u00a0\u00a0Urinates frequently.\u00a0\u00a0We're trying to get him to sleep through the night so we are stopping his liquid intake 1hr before sleep time.\u00a0\u00a0He freaks out over candy and cake.\u00a0\u00a0Very passionate about his sugar. He is extremely picky.\u00a0\u00a0Last Friday, cake was served at pre-school and he didn't get the piece he wanted (not enough frosting) and cried excessively for 30min (2min into the crying, ended up in the car returning home without any cake).\u00a0\u00a0But the part that worries me most is when he takes late afternoon naps (after 3pm), I can count on him to wake up crying for the next 30min.\u00a0\u00a0He is inconsolable.\u00a0\u00a0It's like he doesn't see me and I can tell he's still sleepy.\u00a0\u00a0After he drinks juice or eats a meal, he calms down wonderfully and is in excellent mood afterward.\u00a0\u00a0I list all these because I'm worried about juvenile diabetes but wondering if I'm being overly sensitive.\u00a0\u00a0He's decently active (husband and I are both hyperactive so having an active child seems normal to us), but wondering if excessive crying after nap is just because he's had sensory overload?",
