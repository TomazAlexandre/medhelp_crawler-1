    "question": "In April of 2012, I had a high risk exposure with a guy I was serious with at the time, no condoms were used and he did come in me a few times. Fast forward 13 days afterwards I had sore throat to the point where I could barely swallow then mid July I had diarrhea that lasted almost a month. He's told me over and over that he's negative but I'm still convinced somehow I may have HIV. I'm also a type 2 diabetic and a lot of the diabetes symptoms mimic hiv symptoms...Was the sore throat then diarrhea 2 months later Ars???",
