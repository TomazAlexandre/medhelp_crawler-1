            "answer": "My 14 year old Thomas has been having seizures since March 28th. I have had an MRI, CT scan and a Spinal Tap run on him. He has been tested for anything and everything one could think of. I have been out $7200 trying to find out why. Thomas has the same symptoms as your cat sometimes. He has different ones. One type his head goes back and his arms go out straight and he screams at the top of his lungs and than growls sometime after it. Others are silent and he will start twitching and jerking. Sometimes he will be walking across the floor and fall over and jerk and scream. My vet tells me he is having seizures. He is on Phenobarbital and Keppra. Sometimes we go a few days without having an episode sometimes we are up several nights and days together. He has seen me through my hard times and I shall see him through his. My vet tells me he is not suffering I don't know what to think when I see it. I've never seen that before. I'm so scared and worried. This is my little 4 legged child here and love him so very much. You might want to take your little 13 year old baby to the vet. Nobody can tell me why my baby is having them. I would love to know so I can make it all better for him.",

            "answer": "It could be that he's getting sudden sharp pain from some internal problem. It's possible it's a form of petite mal but without more classic symptoms it's hard to be sure. I would get him checked out, just in case it's something that is progressive and can't be treated if to long has passed.At 13, your cat is likely going through \"the change\" (getting older). He should get a full blood work up to see if he is developing needs for special dietary or supplemental considerations. Diabetes, thyroid issues, etc...are all issues old folks/creatures have to inevitably face.",
