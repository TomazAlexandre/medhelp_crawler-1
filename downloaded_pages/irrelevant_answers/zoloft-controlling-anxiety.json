            "answer": "The hormones have been making me have some crazy emotions too. I also struggle with anxiety and depression as well as being newly diagnosed with gestational diabetes (like I didnt have enough to worry about), but if the doctor is willing to prescribe you something then they should be aware of the risks and how likely they are to occur. In the end though weight out the pros and cons for yourself. Being under that much stress and anxiety may be worse for you and the baby then the medications. In the end it is up to you and how you feel/what you feel you need.",

            "answer": "I was on bupropion for a good chunk of my pregnancy and have now weaned off of it successfully. But the doc is putting me on zoloft after I have my baby because it supposedly doesn't transfer through breast milk where as the stuff I was on did. It was tough coming off the med I was on and I definitely notice my depression getting worse again. Glad my doctor realized the importance of getting me back on something afterwards. It really is up to you, only you can gauge how you're feeling. But don't feel bad if you need to take it. The anxiety can be worse in the long run for you and for baby. Good luck!:)",

    "question": "The closer I'm getting to having my baby the more stressed I am. I have suffered from anxiety & depression for most of my life & for a decade went through the mill of different prescriptions until finally I was fed up & decided I needed to try doing it on my own with homeopathic remedies, meditation, & exercise. That has worked for me for the last several years.Now my nerves & hormones are on edge with constant worry & I'm having a hard time keeping everything in check.So my ob doctor prescribed me zoloft. I have not yet filled the prescription as I am really on the fence about taking pharmaceuticals again, especially while pregnant. Everything I read scares me away from them!What are some of your experiences? Any info, advice, thoughts-it's all appreciated.",
