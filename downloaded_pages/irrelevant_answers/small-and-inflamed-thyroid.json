            "answer": "I always\u00a0\u00a0thought thyroid was a priority for endos tho I realize diabetes is a major concern these days . After suffering for years with most of the symptoms for hashi I found a doctor who was willing to prescribe thyroxine although all my tests came back normal ,after 3 months I became50 % better\u00a0\u00a0 As there is no cure for hashimoto only treatment , the treatment being thyroxine , I was sure I had this disease but no , all doctors since then just poo poo it!!!!according to latest specialist I have chronic fatigue syndrome . I was told to read \" coping with CFS \"and just live with iitSo I struggle on with pain, numbness thudding heart inner tremors dizziness tiredness etc . I have never seen my blood test results ever as doctors say I would not understand them any way !!!! I read up\u00a0\u00a0on all thyroid problems but most are about goiters nodules hypo , hyper, graves and autoimmune and never seen anything about shrunken thyroid . Does it mean my thyroid is gradually being destroyed ? The endo I have an appointment with is the first one I saw 18 years ago so I am hoping he has learnt a lot more about thyroid and not quite as off hand . Many thanks for taking time to read this letter.",

            "answer": "Well here we are again thanks for all your info seen endo who said I definitely have hashi and an autoimmune disease which, he said , can't do any thing about !!!! I have had pain and discomfort in throat neck jaw and ear since 1995along with most of the hashi symptoms. My endo said \" this is not connected to my thyroid problem\" which staggered me !!!!so now I am doubting the hashi diagnosis. All the research I ha e done ,the only illness that\u00a0\u00a0mentions pain in this area is de quervains thyroiditis but it is short lived usually , now I am thinking have I got chronic de quervains or hashimotos ! Any info on this would be helpful\u00a0\u00a0many thanks",

    "question": "I have suffered for 19 years with most of the awful symptoms described for hashimoto disease . After seeing many doctors and having many blood tests and being told in no in certain terms I have not got a thyroid problem\u00a0\u00a0all tests returned normal, I have found a doctor who agreed that my thyroid needed looking at! I have recently had an ultrasound results were. Thyroid very small , inflamed and definitely some type of thyroiditis . My question. What does this mean and what happens now ? I have just got an appointment\u00a0\u00a0to see an endocrinologist but not until late November . I don't suppose there is any rush after waiting 19 years but I have always known I had a thyroid\u00a0\u00a0problem and always been told I have not!!!!! Thank you for listening\u00a0\u00a0 Jaybrooke",
