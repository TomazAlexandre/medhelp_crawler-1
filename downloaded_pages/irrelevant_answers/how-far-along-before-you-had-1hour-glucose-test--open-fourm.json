When they realized my 'risks' they said I will be having it early. I knew I don't have it. Actually, it's a bit on the low side while I'm pg. I have to eat/drink something every 2 hours to keep from getting dizzy or sick.I wouldn't worry too much about it. Getting tested when you're 28 weeks should be ok. Or you can ask to be tested at 24/25 weeks. That's what we did with my 1st because I was feeling sick all the time",
