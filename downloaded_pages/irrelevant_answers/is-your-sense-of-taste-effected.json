            "answer": "Hey Buffy,I'm impressed with all the questions you come up with, unfortunately most of them are directly related to your symptoms.At least they provide the basis for feedback, so, not only you but other members as well, can benefit from some of the answers.Nutritional Deficiencies like Zinc and Copper deficiencies, Endocrine dysfunction and Fluctuating hormonal levels may contribute to taste changes. Some diseases may affect taste also; i.e. M.S.,Cirrhosis, Sj\u00f6gren's, Diabetes.Hope this helps.Niko",
