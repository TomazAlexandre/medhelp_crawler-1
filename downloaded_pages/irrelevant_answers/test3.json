I had to call the last time to see the results a week and a half later just to find out that I needed to go back in for another ultrasound. I have this feeling that they aren't gonna say anything until I call or wait till my next appt which is in Feb. Feel like they don't care and are in a hurry to get me out of the office",

You can call or at your next appointment tell them you want them to contact you with all test results as soon as they're available. It's your right as a patient to know what's going on, good or bad. You have questions either way and they deserve the doctors attention.But, with my glucose test I got the results within minutes of them doing the finger prick blood test.",
