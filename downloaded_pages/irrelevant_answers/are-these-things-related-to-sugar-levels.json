            "answer": "First, let me commend you for seeking out information to help you better understand the disease your boyfriend lives with; that says alot about how much you must care for him.\u00a0\u00a0All of the things you mentioned can be effected by blood sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Both low and high blood sugar levels can make people irritable, irrational, and sometimes even combative.\u00a0\u00a0Each person is different in the way their mind and body reacts to their own blood sugar level.\u00a0\u00a0The best way to know for sure\u00a0\u00a0what your dealing with (low blood sugar levels or whether the swing is attributed to something else) is to have your boyfriend test his level.\u00a0\u00a0He should be testing regularly anyway, but in situations where he suddenly becomes moody or his energy level isn't what it normally is, that's cause to check his blood sugar levels, right then and there.\u00a0\u00a0That way he can deal with them properly.\u00a0\u00a0He should also be seeing a diabetes specialist to help him fine tune his diabetes management.\u00a0\u00a0Things change quickly in the medical world and the way he has been approaching his routine may not be the most current approach ~ his physician will be able to determine that.As for the strenuous exercise ~ if he is taking care of himself properly and there are no other underlying physical concerns, there should be no reason he shouldn't engage in physical activity.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, exercise is one of the key components in leading a healthy life and actually aids in blood sugar control.\u00a0\u00a0When he consults his physician, he can express any concerns he may have to the doctor and let the doctor advise him further.You may also want to consider taking a course on diabetes management to help YOU better understand what is needed to keep your boyfriend healthy.\u00a0\u00a0Check with the hospital in your area or with your boyfriend's doctor to see what's offered in your area.\u00a0\u00a0You'll feel so much more confident knowing what it takes to keep him healthy.Please let us know how things go~best of luck to you both!",

            "answer": "It can make him combative? He does get into physical fights at school with other guys sometimes...I wish I could be so involved but it's hard for me to do that. You see we're both 15 years old, we've been going out for almost a year and I love him very much, but it's sometimes awkward to talk about diabetes. It's a really sensitive subject for him. Also he hates when his mom thinks he can't handle it himself, like when she reminds him to take insulin or tells him to stop eating so much sugar or to read a book about his desease. So if I started doing stuff like that I think he'd get really annoyed. Although he's starting to be more comfotable about it with me. Like he doesn't mind if I see him injecting. I don't think it's gross at all.His mom told me that he's had really high blood sugar lately but he says she's exaggerating. I think he is trying to lower it though.Does type 1 make you hungry a lot? He eats like non stop but stays fit anyway. It goes right through him.One more thing, he has an addiction to diet coke/pepsi...is this just him or is it because of the type 1?THANX SO MUCH FOR READING",

            "answer": "OK . . . so many issues here!\u00a0\u00a0Let's start with the combative issue.\u00a0\u00a0His fighting at school may not have anything to do directly with his blood sugar, and then again it might!\u00a0\u00a0The fighting may be totally out of his control because his blood sugar levels are within the target range or it could be his way of lashing out over the frustration of living with a chronic illness.\u00a0\u00a0The teenage years are very difficult on their own ~ then you factor in an illness such as diabetes and there is more cause for anger and frustration.\u00a0\u00a0No one, but especially teens, want to feel different and that's one reason why your boyfriend is being very private about his diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that he's becoming more comfortable with it around you is a good sign, though.\u00a0\u00a0You may want to read more about diabetes at our website\u00a0\u00a0www.jdrf.org and feed yourself with as much information as you can.\u00a0\u00a0Let him know you care about him and want to be able to help him should he ever need you to do so.You didn't mention how long ago he was diagnosed and whether or not he uses a pump or injections.\u00a0\u00a0Just curious, because depending on how long ago he was diagnosed, it may play into how he's handling the food issues.\u00a0\u00a0Diet soft drinks are \"free foods\" for diabetics, meaning they don't have any carbohydrates in them that need to be balanced with insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Diet soft drinks are not the best choice for anyone, however, if they're balanced with a good diet, we parents tend to look the other way.Again, I encourage you to read as much as you can~ check out the JDRF website at www.jdrf.org\u00a0\u00a0as well as www.childrenwithdiabetes.orgthat site has alot of information as well that you might find helpful!hope this helps,",

            "answer": "I have had diabetes for 7 years and am now 18.\u00a0\u00a0Let me just start off by saying that your bf reminds me a lot myself when I was his age.I went through a stage of rebellion and stopped doing my shots stopped taking my blood sugar and just acted like I was for lack of a better word normal! I ate what I wanted when i wanted never thinking twice about what I was doing to my body. When my parents would ask me if I did my shots or took my sugar I would just lie. I lied to the people I loved most and was just angry at the world(and GOD) for giving me this disease.I finally after about almost a year realized what I was doing to myself and my family and decided that I needed to take control. I had a lot of the symptoms that your bf has except for the fighting at school...but not at home I did fight at home with my family.I have found a way to use having diabetes to my advantage. I started a support group that is more like a bunch of kids getting together talking about their lives and sometimes if they want to talk about diabetes. I also council newly diagnosed kids and teenagers that have rebelled like I did and try to convince them to take care of themselves. I have gotten some teens to think twice.Now I am just telling you about my experience. I would just say hey I am worried about you and want to know if everything is ok. You dont have to say anything about diabetes if you think that will turn him off. Just say you care about him and want to make sure everything is ok!It can be hard watching someone you love not be themselves and not know what to do.I hope I have a boyfriend some day who cares as much about me as you do your boyfriend. hope everything turns out ok!!ErikaPumpgirl03Ps after I got an insulin pump was when I started to control my blood sugars.",

            "answer": "Thanks very much for your replies.He was diagnosed when he was 8 years old. His mom gave him his first shot and she messed up so now he has a scar on his butt. He did it from then on.He doesn't rebel and stop taking madicine. He's smarter than that. He always takes it. Maybe not enough though and he doesn't watch his diet too carefully.He didn't tell me about his diabetes until we went on a camping trip and he had to tak his insulin along and his mom told me.Since he has let me know about his disease, he's a little more open about it. He'll tell his good friends why he's not drinking regular soda. When he was a kid he used to get teased a lot because of diabetes so that made him really sensitive about it.He's a wonderful guy though. He's on Prozac for his mood swings. Usually he's just the sweetest person you'll ever meet and he doesn't ever get mean, just unresponsive once in a while. It's ok though cuz no one has ever been better to me than him.",

            "answer": "Dear holdmytail,Thank you so much for seeking information to help your boyfriend. It's obvious you care very much for him.\u00a0\u00a0My son had the exact same issue's when he was growing up.\u00a0\u00a0He also had mood swing's like you described.\u00a0\u00a0He didn't test his blood sugars and take his insulin when he should have.\u00a0\u00a0While I'm not a physician, I feel there can sometimes be a bit of denial when your dealing with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with JDRF Team JHG that he need's regular care from a diabetes specialist and maybe a counselor to help with possible depression.My son also had problem's with anger in high school.\u00a0\u00a0The good new's is when he came to term's with his diabetes and got control, everything leveled out.\u00a0\u00a0He has come along way.It's not unusual for a person to be upset with a parent who is trying to help they're son get better control of his diabetes.The information you seek and the help your trying to give him is wonderful, but don't take this on all by yourself.\u00a0\u00a0It come's down to his family, himself and physicians, with your support.\u00a0\u00a0Keep in touch and I would advise you to give this website to his mom or the Juvenile Diabetes web listed at the beginning.As I said before, keep in touch.

    "question": "My boyfriend has type 1 diabetes. Is this what gives him mood swings sometimes? Or sometimes he gets very sleepy. He sleeps a lot and never has the energy to stay up.
