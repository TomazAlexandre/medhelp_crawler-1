            "answer": "My cardio doc is a non-interventional (meds only but there are exceptions) and if medication can dilate the vessels and prevent angina there is no medical justification for intervention (bypass/stents) that interrupts the important function of the endothelium cells.A stent interrupts the thin lining (endothelium cells) of the arteries, and these cells are sensitive to blood velocity and signal the neuro system to regulate the cardio/vascular biological functionality.\u00a0\u00a0That includes vasodilation, and hence the control of blood pressure, blood clotting (thrombosis & fibrinolysis), atherosclerosis, formation of new blood vessels (angiogenesis), inflammation and swelling (edema).Endothelium-derived relaxing factor was originally the name given to several proposed factors causing vasodilation. The major endothelial derived relaxing factor was later discovered to be nitric oxide (NO). Endothelium-derived relaxing factor is produced and released by the endothelium that results in smooth muscle relaxation. It is released in response to a variety of chemical and physical stimuli. It causes the smooth muscle in the vessel wall to relax.People with diabetes usually have lower levels of Nitric Oxide than patients without diabetes. Diminished supply of Nitric Oxide can lead to vascular damage, such as endothelial dysfunction and vascular inflammation. Vascular damage can lead to decreased blood flow to the extremities, causing the diabetic patient to be more likely to develop Neuropathy, non-healing ulcers, and be at a greater risk for lower limb amputation.There is a natural phenomonon (collateral vessels) that bypasses distressed arteries.\u00a0\u00a0The process begins when the system detects the distress, but if there is a stent implant the site isn't recognized as needing collaterals, but the system reacts to the simuli of a foreign substance in a varity of different responses.\u00a0\u00a0An increase in the number of stents greatly increases the probability of unfavorable results notwithstanding drug eluding stents.If pain can be controlled with medication,\u00a0\u00a0there is no need to risk interventional problems.",

    "question": "I have a question that has been bothering me.\u00a0\u00a0I have 5 DES\u00a0\u00a0in\u00a0\u00a0the LAD\u00a0\u00a0, 3 from a previous MI\u00a0\u00a0and 2 from a blockage 1 year ago. I recently had a cath which came out good , no blockages.\u00a0\u00a0My\u00a0\u00a0new cardiologist says that ,\u00a0\u00a0 that\u00a0\u00a0is too many stents for 1 artery and that my last blockage should have been a bypass rather than putting more\u00a0\u00a0stents in that artery . I recently had a cath which came out good ,\u00a0\u00a0no blockages.\u00a0\u00a0I got a copy of the\u00a0\u00a0CD\u00a0\u00a0of the cathand I could see all the stents back to back with no gaps in between them ,\u00a0\u00a0it measured a total of about\u00a0\u00a03 & 1/8\u00a0\u00a0in. long.\u00a0\u00a0I know there is alot of controversy lately about stents,\u00a0\u00a0But I don,t understand why my cardiologist would think that 5 stents were the wrong thing to do.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone have an answer to that ?\u00a0\u00a0 Thanks.",
