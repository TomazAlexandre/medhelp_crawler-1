            "answer": "I wouldnt worry to much. I just had this happen to me. I went to a specialist and they did an ultra sound and he checked babys growth, amniotic fluid etx. My baby was completely healthy and all was NORMAL. He told me the measurements can be rather inaccurate at times. I am not a skinny woman and was a lil heavy prior to pregnancy. The specialist said i was measuring ahead not because of baby but because of me lol. Keep your chin up! Good luck!",
