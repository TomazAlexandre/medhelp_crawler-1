            "answer": "I just wondering. My husband has diabetes and had the sensory test done, but that showed to be fine. His feet and calves have (as he explains it) shocking feelings in his feet. He says its like jolts of electricity running through his legs. They hurt so bad he is unable to ware socks or shoes, I can't even touch them to rub them for him. The symptoms he has fits that of Diabetic Neuropathy, so I just wondering if the EMG would be able to see if he does have nerve damage from the diabetes. If someone could let me know. Thanks",
