            "answer": "Do you use internet porn? The major sign of overstimulating your brain with porn - is what you describe - copulatory impotence.We have seen so many men with this problem, and the \"experts\" don't have a clue. They don't understand neurobiology of erections, or how Internet porn can alter the brain. So, it's porn, not masturbation that can do this to men.If it is porn, you need to learn about this condition and about others who have it, and have healed.Here's the thread you should look at for porn-induced ED. If you control find - \"palpateit\", you will see my posts. The first 2 posts have links to presentations and articles about porn-induced ED.http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Mens-Health/22-with-porn-induced-erectile-dysfunction/show/469209",

            "answer": "I dont watch internet porn. I use previous and made up mental images instead. I have tried porn, here and there, but it does very little. I have recently been diagnosed with narcoleptic symptoms and have had a sleep study done. I will start meds soon that will aid my sleep in hopes that it's mental tiredness that could be partial problem. Other than that my girlfriend hasn't complained once and we have sex very often.",

            "answer": "The fact that you mention you have not had an erection in the morning for some time tells me you should really see a doctor for further investigation. It could well be related to you not sleeping well, but I would want to rule out other problems, such as prostate, diabetes, etc. Most of the above are not likely to be the case, but as always, the sooner you get tested, the sooner you know, AND the sooner the problem gets fixed. Good luck xxx",

    "question": "What could be the cause of my penis not being as stiff as it used to be? It takes a moment for me to get hard, but when erect the penis is still somewhat soft. I can achieve climax when I masturbate, but I sometimes get completely soft and have to play it off when I'm having sex with the ladies. Also, I havent had morning wood for as long as I can remember now.. Has something changed? Signs of possible ED or actual ED?\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance.",
