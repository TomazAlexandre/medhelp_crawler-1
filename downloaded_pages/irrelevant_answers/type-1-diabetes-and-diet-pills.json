            "answer": "I agree with the previous posting. I believe the very first thing you should do is ask your doctor why he or she has not worked with you much earlier to get your weight within normal levels. Any endocrinologist worth his or her money SHOULD care about the patient's weight because it affects the patient's sensitivity to insulin and of course can make blood pressure problems happen. So your doctor should be right with you in wanting your weight to be normal.I would ask directly for a diet plan and for help in lowering insulin dosage when the carbs are changed (as I assume they will be if you lower your calorie intake). A change in diet should start the weight loss and maybe adding some regular exercise (even walking around the block each morning or evening) should help.",

            "answer": "Hi,I would change my diet to a low carb diet.\u00a0\u00a0A lot of news has been coming out about low carb and I am doing low carb.\u00a0\u00a0It has really helped me keep my BG down to an acceptable leval.You might try researching the Dr. Bernstein diet for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0It really works and does not affect a person in any bad way.\u00a0\u00a0You also do not have to starve yourself on this diet.\u00a0\u00a0I eat between 2000 up to 3000 calories a day but those calories are coming from low carb food.\u00a0\u00a0My total carb intake is about 100 grams of carbs a day verses the normal 300 - 400 grams a day most people eat (no wonder they can't lose weight).\u00a0\u00a0I have actually lost a few pounds with out even trying.The only thing about a low carb diet is that a lot of Drs do not believe in it as they have all been brought up on the high carb way of living and think that the ADA diet is the only diet for diabetics.\u00a0\u00a0When I did the ADA diet I not only gained weight, but I could never keep my BG numbers in line (I was always high).\u00a0\u00a0Now I keep my numbers very, very close to normal doing the low carb.\u00a0\u00a0 But be warned,\u00a0\u00a0Most people do not believe that you can eat low carb and get thin, but it is true.And last but not least, don't forget to exercise (very important).Bob",

            "answer": "I have noticed that symlin works great! This is a relatively new drug that someone with type one diabetes gives themself in an injection prior to eating a meal. It reduces the amount of insulin you need with meals and also makes the insulin you do use more effective. The worst and most noted side effect of this medication is nausea, which in turn causes you to eat less at meals. It is best given before a high fat/calorie meal. I have noticed positive results with this medication. It can leave some icky looking bruises though where you give your injections. I would look into it for anyone interested in losing weight!",

            "answer": "I read an article few weeks ago about how important water is for your body and minimizes a lot of health problems. When you wake up in the morning drink about 20 ounces of water and brush your teeth. Wait about 45 minutes and then eat breakfast. I started doing this last week and i'm starting to feel better. I'm 46 yrs old and I've been diabetic since I was 17 months old. I'm on the insulin pump now. I have noticed that when I follow the diet I loose wait and feel good, then I go back to fast food and gain wait and feel crappy. That's because not only I'm eating extra but this food is full of fat and the insulin can not work as well. I hope this helps a little.",

            "answer": "I assume you get regularly tested for thyroid to make sure that isn't the cause of your weight gain and you don't need an adjustment in thyroid meds. Insulin doesn't make people gain weight, though sometimes people lose weight when initially diagnosed with very high numbers and when their blood sugar gets under control they continue eating the same way and gain weight. Another cause of weight gain in Type 1's is insulin resistance. This is normally a characteristic of Type 2 diabetes, but type 1's who are in the \"eat whatever you want and bolus for it\" school of diet will both gain weight and develop IR. Of course the best way to reduce resistance is to lose weight so it is a bit of a catch 22. If you have developed a significant insulin resistance as shown by the need to take higher doses of insulin to maintain blood sugars, you might also want to talk to your endo about putting you on metformin. Usually a type 2 medication it is often used in type 1's to combat IR and it can help keep weight down/lose weight as well.Other than that I don't recommend some of the fad diets people talk about as they can be really not good for people with diabetes. What is good for weight loss is the same thing that is good for lowering blood sugar: reduction in carb intake. The lower carb you can eat the more you can lose weight and lower insulin intake. Many people who eat low carb for diabetes advocate high fat. I personally don't think this makes sense, but it especially doesn't make sense if you want to lose weight so the less fat the more you can lose weight. So non-fat yogurt, milk, etc. And of course exercise is especially helpful in combatting the insulin resistance that makes it hard to lose weight.",
