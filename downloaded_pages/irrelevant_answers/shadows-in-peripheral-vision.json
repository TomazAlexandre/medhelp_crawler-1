    "question": "Hi there,I have been seeing moving shadows in my peripheral vision for about 2 months now. This happens at all times of the day, regardless of sleep etc.Another few things. I get constant headaches, which occur all over. When I close my eyes, I get dizzy and need to hold onto something to remain standing. The top of my head gets numb on the left side frequently.It's probably nothing, thought I'd check. Thanks!Natalie",
