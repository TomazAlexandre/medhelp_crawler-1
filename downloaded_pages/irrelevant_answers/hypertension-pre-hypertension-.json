    "question": "Hi, I am 18 years old and I have a question, which has been concerning me a lot lately. Recently I've had my Blood Pressure taken about three different times. One by an EMT trainee, A School nurse, and by an RN (CNA Instructor). I had it checked was in April, and it was 140/80. Than, about a month ago, it was 138/72. I had mine checked by my instructor today, and it was 142/70. I am unsure why my Systolic pressure is as high as it is. I exercise regularly, avoid caffeine*(makes me feel odd)- and weigh in at 130 at 5ft 6in. I do have a history of poor eating, and recently started eating less. My diet use to consist of Fast Food and a lot of unhealthy bags of chips. I would basically eat anything that taste good, especially hot cheetos. But I made a slight changed once I started to feel unwell, I would feel fatigue after big meals, and my pule would race to about 110bm, one day it went to about 120bpm without any straining physical activity. I try to walk everyday, and run every other day when I get a chance. I do feel a lot better when I exercise, and I notice my Cardio has been a lot better, I don't get burned out as much as I use to. Anyways, I could ramble on about a lot of things, but I want to know if I should go see my doctor with the worry of heart disease, diabetes, Arteriosclerosis, etc. It would be a big help if somebody would give me some advice, thank you.",
