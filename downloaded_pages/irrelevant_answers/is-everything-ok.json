    "question": "Hello. I am 38 & female. In 2000, 6 months after birth of my son I noticed a knot in the front of my neck.\u00a0\u00a0Went to dr, refered to ENT and diagnosed with goiter.\u00a0\u00a0Several FNAs said fluid blood filled.\u00a0\u00a0Ultrasound revealed several cysts.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. said he wanted to keep watching as he felt a little suspicious.\u00a0\u00a0All blood tests said thryoid functioning fine.\u00a0\u00a0Put on Synthroid to shrink goiter.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. said if it shrinks I would be able to quit taking med.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, the Dr. I was seeing moved shortly thereafter and I had to see his partner who did not agree with EVER quiting the med. The goiter did shrink. Anyway, I became pregnant in 02 and stayed on the drug throughout my pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I stoped seeing ENT and let my obgyn take over meds.\u00a0\u00a0Two months after birth I quit taking med on my own.\u00a0\u00a0All has been ok. Last month I started having a problem with my heart rate getting too high causing pain (during exercise only). Went to family Dr. Many tests & dx with tachycardia. Take Atenolol. Thyroid tested and is normal.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. said I should see about the cysts and sent\u00a0\u00a0me to new ENT. Had another ultrasound.\u00a0\u00a0ENT said left lobe in 2000 us was 3.1 and is 4.1 1/2 now.\u00a0\u00a0The right was 3.1 1/2 and now is 5.1.\u00a0\u00a0Diagnosed as \"non-toxic uninodular goiter\".\u00a0\u00a0He said the growth was little over 6 yrs, so just call back if I notice any change.\u00a0\u00a0Will the us tell if cysts are cancerous or not?\u00a0\u00a0Is the wait & see ok or should I be scheduled for a follow-up? Will cysts likely grow? My mother has Hashimotas could this be any indication that I will get it?Thank you for your time!",
