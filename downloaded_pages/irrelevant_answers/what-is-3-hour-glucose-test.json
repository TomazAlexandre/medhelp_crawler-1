            "answer": "Did they tell you what your blood sugar reading was after your 1 hour?The 3 hour, they will take several blood samples to see what how your blood sugar adjusts over time after drinking the glucose solution.It won't hurt you or the baby... it's to protect you and the baby.\u00a0\u00a0If you \"fail\" that one too, they will likely recommend you see a dietician and begin a restricted carb/sugar diet and add in simple exercising to control the \"gestational diabetes\".\u00a0\u00a0It is VERY important to follow that diet and check your blood sugar several times a day to ensure you are staying on track.\u00a0\u00a0The guidelines are much stricter for pregnant women than non pregnant diabetics as it can have a negative effect on your baby if too much sugar is constantly coming to your baby.\u00a0\u00a0Large birth weights, increased c-section, birth defects, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Not to scare you, but it's important to follow through.\u00a0\u00a0I had gestational diabetes with my son.\u00a0\u00a08 lbs 8 oz.\u00a0\u00a0I gained 24 lbs total due to the strict diet.\u00a0\u00a0That was almost 7 years ago and I am recently diagnosed with Type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I am a little nervous about getting pregnant again until I have this back under control because I know the importance of maintainig my own health for the babies sake... and my own.Good luck!",

I had to go for the 3 hr test and did fine.\u00a0\u00a0Try to schedule it first thing in the morning b/c you'll have to fast before the test.\u00a0\u00a0I went in, they did a blood draw to get a baseline glucose level, when that came back they gave me the solution (about 30 min after I arrived).\u00a0\u00a0Then they drew blood on the hour for three hours.\u00a0\u00a0After the test they told me to go have lunch and come back for the results.\u00a0\u00a0My test was done in a lab at a hospital so I just went to the cafeteria quick.\u00a0\u00a0They were able to tell me my results right there - I did fine - no further testing or anything.\u00a0\u00a0I have a friend who failed her 1hr test so badly they didn't send her for the 3 hr test - she was diagnosed with Gestational Diabetes right there.\u00a0\u00a0She attended a class and met with a nutrutionist and had an otherwise healthy/normal pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",
