            "answer": "Hello,Numbness and tingling are abnormal sensations that can occur anywhere in your body.Many causes of numbness in the leg are there. These include injury to the back or spinal cord, diabetes, stroke, multiple sclerosis and underactive thyroid. Abnormal levels of calcium, potassium, or sodium in your body and a lack of vitamin B12 can also cause tingling sensations.You can take multivitamins for some time. Also get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels tested.In case the symptoms persist then pls consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder. Common disorders causing paraesthesias are transient ischemic attack, motor neurone disease, or autoimmune disorders like multiple sclerosis or lupus erythematosus. A diagnostic evaluation by a doctor is necessary to rule these out.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing.",
