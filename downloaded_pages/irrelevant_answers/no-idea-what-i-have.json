            "answer": "Hi,There are a couple of possibilities that need to be looked into. Peripheral neuropathy is one of them which can occur due to B 12 deficiency, metabolic disorder like thyroid dysfunction or due to diabetes.These symptoms could also be a feature of migraines. Migraines can occur with or without headaches. The possibility of neurological lesions also needs to be looked into.A neurological exam is warranted in your case. Please get it done at your earliest.Thanks",
