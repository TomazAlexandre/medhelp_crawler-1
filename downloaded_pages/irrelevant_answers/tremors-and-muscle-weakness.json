            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear about your symptoms, but am really sorry, without a clinical evaluation, it will be really difficult to diagnose your condition on net. A few possibilities are fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, severe anemia, spinal nerve compression high up in the cervical spine, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritic changes of the vertebrae, calcium deficiency, low Vit D, ALS, electrolyte disturbance, peripheral neuropathy due to diabetes or hypothyroidism or due to bad posture. Lyme and lupus are the other possibilities. Electromyography (EMG), nerve conduction velocity (NCV), muscle biopsy, tendon reflexes, muscle strength etc are testes to confirm diagnosis. Your neurological consultation will help reach a diagnosis. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
