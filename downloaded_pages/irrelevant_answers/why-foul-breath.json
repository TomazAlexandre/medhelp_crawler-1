            "answer": "Bad breath does not always originate from dental problems.\u00a0\u00a0If a dog has a problem with internal organs like kidneys or the liver for example, it can result in some horrific-smelling breath.\u00a0\u00a0Untreated diabetes can harm the kidneys and result in bad breath too.\u00a0\u00a0If your dog has consitent bad breath, it's time for your vet to do an exam and get to the bottom of it.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully it's only a matter of needing some tartar removal.\u00a0\u00a0:-)",

            "answer": "Here's how I tell the difference: Let your dog chew/play with a STUFFED toy. Then immediately smell the toy....If the odor is on the toy, it's from the teeth/mouth and it's time for a dental/teeth cleaning. If not, then it's coming from somewhere else.(Farther down). Sometimes it's just an overgrowth of bacteria in the digestive system. In this case, a Probiotic is helpful, to counter-act the bad bacteria in the gut. Otherwise, a bloodtest is in order to look for organ problems. Hope some of this helps....KarlaP.S. As of right now, 83% of dogs in the U.S. have some kind of dental disease by the age of 3 yrs. old. Most of these dogs are fed dry kibble. That will probably answer your question about food... If it's actually Dental Disease...Please address it, now. It's unbelieveable what it can lead to.....Trust me on this one!!!!!!!",

            "answer": "When our dogs have their teeth cleaned, they have to be sedated and I really don't like that unless they have to have a tooth extracted.\u00a0\u00a0So we bought some dog toothbrushes (no I'm not kidding) and some dog toothpaste that they love the taste of.\u00a0\u00a0Every night we brush their teeth,\u00a0\u00a0We also try to give them treats that will help their teeth.\u00a0\u00a0Our Akita is 12 yrs old and has no dental problems.\u00a0\u00a0Ever since she was a puppy, she has been chewing on \"Cheweeze\" or \"Denti-Bone\".Hope everything works out with your shih tzu.\u00a0\u00a0We have a shih tzu too and he hates having his teeth brushed.",

    "question": "I know bacteria in the mouth causes bad breath and Sugar my shih-tzu's breath was extremely gross-she went to groomers this weekend I paid for toothbrushing she smelled lovely and the smell is already back- seems to be no pain or anything- she eats fine but usually only soft foods like wieners or chicken bites- She will not eat hard dog food unless she is starving- should I make her? Would that help?",
