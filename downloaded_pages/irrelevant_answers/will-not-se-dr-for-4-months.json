            "answer": "You have evidence of what cardiologist call diastolic dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0This is typically related to conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, coronary artery or aortic stenosis, however, may also occur with aging and with infiltrative diseases such as amyloidosis, etc.\u00a0\u00a0If you do have high blood pressure, you must control it.\u00a0\u00a0If there is no high blood pressure than you should have a thorough workup evaluating for those other conditions I mentioned.\u00a0\u00a0You have evidence of aortic sclerosis, not stenosis, but if the tech did not get a good pressure tracing, or the valve was not well visualized, the aortic stenosis may be missed.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that you have atrial fibrillation also supports the diagnosis of diastolic dysfunction.\u00a0\u00a0Typical therapy for this, depending on your symptoms, consists of control of the underlying conditions (high blood pressure, Diabetes, coronary artery disease), and initiation of beta blockers for heart rate control, diuretics such as lasix if there is fluid overload and medications called ace inhibitors to prevent further remodeling (progression) of the disease.",

When I move around a lot I cannot seem to catch my breath and exercising is out.\u00a0\u00a0I have had to stop water walking because of breathing problems.\u00a0\u00a0I went to a pulmonary Dr and he wanted a heart cath done to rule out pph but since I have a cardiologist he must be the one to do it and they do not agree.\u00a0\u00a0I had rheumatic fever when I was 12 (57 now) .\u00a0\u00a0Yes I copied the info from the ECHO report that was sent to me.\u00a0\u00a0The afib I experienced while doing the nuclear stress test lasted from 9am to 3:30pm.",
