            "answer": "Yes, and various forms of cancer...all results are negative. I was in India 2 years ago and when I came back I had the same symptoms, but only for 4 days. 2 years later and I have the same symptoms, but for 6 months. I'm not sure if it could be something I picked up in India but the doctors don't think this is possible. It may just be a co-incidence and that the post-India symptoms were realted to an isolated tummy bug.",

    "question": "I am 33 years old and 55kgs. 6 months ago I woke up to find my stomach distended to the size of a woman 6 months pregnant (I get 'congratulated' all the time), although I am not pregnant. When the swelling first happened I was nauseas and vomited for a day. Since then, the distension only ever resides slightly and some days it gets so bad that it covers my ribs and effects my breathing (I think this is because it's presssing on my diaphram). I've been to a gastroentarologist several times for numerous tests, including a endoscopy. I've had blood and stool tests done, and nothing is showing up. The specialist has said I am getting these symptoms because I am stressed, but I believe that this is just their way of finding a solution for something that they can not diagnose. My symptoms are: headaches, bleeding gums, constant thirst, vomiting (undigested food), nausea and a pain about 2 inches above my belly button. I have a hiatus hernia (possibly related? the doctor's don't think this is causing my symptoms) and, until last week, was usinga Mirena. I am totally worn out from the stress and of this situation and the effect it is having on my life. I am normally active but now struggle to find the energy to do anything. Please help.",
