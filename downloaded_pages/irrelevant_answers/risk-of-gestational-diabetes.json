Hopefully it stays this way so I won't have to go on medication or insulin. Unfortunately,\u00a0\u00a0I am what they consider overweight and am predisposed.\u00a0\u00a0I have to say this has kept me in check and I have no gained any weight which was expected since I'm on low carb. This has been a blessing on disguise. I have made my health my priority and will never allow myself to become overweight again.",

It's my understanding you can subsitute some high fiber grams for carb grams,\u00a0\u00a0but I'm unsure how to do the calculations so I don't bother. If you like bread Nature's own has some low cal, low carb whole wheat with fiber,white and honey wheat bread. I usually have one slice toasted for breakfast with 2 eggs and cheese (free carbs) of course I'm not an expert,\u00a0\u00a0just been learning as I go. I still have quite a ways until my due date. It's a lot of trial and error as you learn. I also never deprive myself. I do portion control. If I want pasta and garlic bread I'll have a small portion of it and lots of salad or veggies.",
