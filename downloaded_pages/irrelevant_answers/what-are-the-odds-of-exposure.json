            "answer": "thanks man, i just worry more about my wife and daughter. I have been asymptomatic for the past 10 years, and my daughter is a heathly, hyperactive, smart 3 year old. Back then 5 years was the accepted incubation period until Aids onset, and I thought I had that all behind me. Only to find out that there are 10 to 15 year incubation cases coming out. Just scared that by a remote chance, my stupidity will make my family suffer. 1:2000 is a small chance, and the chances of the prostitue having HIV would even drive the odds more in my favor, but I'm going to get tested anyway just to be sure, please pray for me.",

After reading these forums though, I have gotten to grips with my fear knowing that I am not alone. This has been a life changing moment for me, and it has helped me realise how beautiful life is. I am going to take that test anyway just to be sure. Thanks for all the support.",

    "question": "10 years ago, i had brief unprotected sex with a prostitute (less than an hour, came only once), I never got tested, and back then the widely accepted incubation period was 5 years. I have been happily married for 4 years now and have a healthy 3 year-old daughter. A few weeks back I had dizzy spells, arm aches, and hematoma on the leg, I am thinking that this might be diabetes since i have a family history of diabetics, so I checked it up on the web anyway, only to stumble across information that HIV has an incubation period of 10-15 years for some. Now i am **** scared. What are the odds that I have HIV? I am worried sick that I might have passed it on to my wife and possibly my daughter as well. I am working abroad and will be coming home in a few weeks, i plan to take my test then.",
