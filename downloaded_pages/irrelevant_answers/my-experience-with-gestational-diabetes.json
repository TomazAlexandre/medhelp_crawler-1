    "question": "I just wanted to post... I don't know if maybe to help other moms or what, but I feel I should post what I've learned first hand.I had GD with my first pregnancy. My first daughter came out weighing 7lb 3 oz and was perfect, nothing was wrong with her at all.I delivered my second beautiful daughter June 17th. I thought she'd be just a perfect and healthy. I've read all the stuff about GD and how it can cause newborns to go through a lot. I've been on oral meds since probably 20wks or so for the GD. I was controlled for pretty much the whole pregnancy except for a period of a month, where I wasn't completely honest with my doctor about how my levels had been. I was scared of insulin and giving myself shots. I finally fessed up at 34wks. At 35wks I was admitted to the hospital to control my GD. While I was here my sugars were great with a slight med change and diet. On a side note I was also found to have real mild pre-eclampsia while in the hospital. So my hopes of leaving diminished. I took for granted that since my first daughter came out perfect my second would as well. At 36wks I had a amnio, her lungs were not ready. So we repeated at 37wks 2days and her lungs had matured more than I and the doctors had ever expected. So the next day we were on for a c section. She came out weighing a whopping 10lbs even. I and everyone(including doctors) was SHOCKED. The day before they got her measurements and guessed 7lb 11ozs. So I went to recovery to un-numb and she went to the nursery to be checked out. Her sugar was in the 30's when she came out. They tried to raise it twice before they sent her to the NICU. It just wasn't working. So while I was in recovery two NICU nurses came and talked to my husband and I and told us what was going on. At first I was okay, I mean I had read about babies having low blood sugar when born and I figured maybe a day or two in the NICU and she would be good as gold. The first day I was on a morphine pump and a catheter so I didn't go see her, but DH was there a lot. The next morning once I got off all that stuff I went to the NICU immediately. The first day I was there was horrible she wasn't eating, another common trait of a baby born to a mom with GD, and they put her on a HIGH dose of sugar. They told me her stay there depends completely on her and how she does.Well it's day 3 now, She is completely off of sugar and keeping her sugar normal. Her feeding as of last night when we left was at 22ml and they want her taking 45 per feeding right now. So the rest she gets in her NG tube. They did a EEG to rule out seizures cause she does shake sometimes, but so did her older sister so I'm not worried too bad. Although the EEG came back and said she needs another EEG cause they saw something but aren't sure what it is. Her neonatologist said he will consult a neurologist and it is probably fine which is what I think as well.I guess the moral of the story is gestation diabetes is much much more severe than I gave it credit for.I assumed that because my first daughter was okay that this one would be too. I wouldn't wish this NICU stuff on anyone. It is very hard. I just wanted to share I guess. I took things for granted ya know.",
