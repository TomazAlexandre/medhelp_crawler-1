            "answer": "Maybe your pregnancy started off as a twin pregnancy and that is why you have a \"feeling\"? Vanishing twin is common and so is your feeling of having twins. Ask your doc for another US, to ease your mind. At the very least the next time you go and they check for the heartbeat ask them to move the doppler to another part of your belly just for fun to see if there is anything else, that should confirm one way or another!!!",

    "question": "Ok I know back in the old days women had twins and didn't know they were having twins till the very end cause of lack of technology and ultrasounds. But do u all think its possible now for them to miss it? It the very beginning my uterus was retroverted and made it hard to see so maybe they could have missed it. Now I'm farther along and my uterus is bigger than its supposed to be and i've got lots of amniotic fluid which i know is all signs of twins. I don't think I have twins, but this nagging thought has been in the back of my mind since the VERY beginning when I was having bad back pain at 7wks which I've heard alot of women say they had with twins. This is my first baby. What do u ladies think?",
