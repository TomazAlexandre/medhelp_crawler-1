I mean I got the news from a phone call from my doctor while I was at work :( it got so bad to the point where I just didn't even want to eat because I didn't know what was okay and what wasn't. I went and saw a nutritionist and diabetes specialist and ever since I have felt a lot better! They broke everything down for me and even helped me right out a meal plan. I posted about this not too long ago so if you go to my previous posts you might find some good information :) it'll be okay ladies just remember it's only temporary!",
