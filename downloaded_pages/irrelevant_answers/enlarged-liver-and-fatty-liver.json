As Cary said there is a disorder called NASH\u00a0\u00a0It is a non alcoholic disorder of the liver.It can cause the liver to be enlarged.I have a friend who is over weight, has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She found out she had NAS when she lay on the floor and felt a lump.\u00a0\u00a0It was her liver, very enlarged.She has been told to change her diet as well as lose weight to help her.She had a biopsy and is close to cirrhosis.I am not saying you have that. I am just saying it is really important to find the cause.I\u00a0\u00a0hope you will come back and let us know how you are.Take Care",

            "answer": "Thank you both for your responses. I am making an apt with the GerontologistMy doctor had the nurse tell me the results and all she said to do was not take any acetaminophen until I see her in March. Kinda weird with the resultsa sounding so dire, huh. Well this Liver thing has me going to be scoped and to\u00a0\u00a0have a CAT scan of my chest.I quit drinking 27 years ago, and smoking 3 packs a day a year later.Never had a thought about my liver, and look at the results, so now I am going for the 2 things I have always been concerned about. SOOOOOO At least something good has come out of this --I won't be ignoring 2 tests I should have had years ago.Amazing since I have never had a cold or any other sickness for some 20 years. Seriously! Now I find out my Liver is squirrely--this is how it starts I fear.I will keep you guys posted as I know my story may help others.Thank you for the concern and your help.",

    "question": "Does anyone know if enlarged liver and fatty liver are the same?Does anyone know if Heavy drinking for 10 years--sober for the last 25 would have anything to do with this Liver evaluation? Shouldn't 25 years abstinence from Alcohol have reversed any harmful effects or has the damage already been done because of those 10 years as alcoholic.Ultra sound findings: Increased hepatic echotexture consistent w/ fatty infiltration. The liver appears enlarged. There is no mas sor intrahepatic ductal dilation Common duct normalGallbladder fine, pancreas fineHelp! Is this really bad news?Thanks,CM",
