Have you had any past ailments?\u00a0\u00a0Or any other family diabetic history?\u00a0\u00a0These are all can bring you this in one form or the other. My husband got his type 2 diabetes treatment from Toronto's Physiomed. They usually have customized physiotherapy and chiropractic massages\u00a0\u00a0including acupuncture and compression therapies. DH was immensely benefitted from the treatment here. I would suggest you take a consultation with an rMT before any massage sessions. Trust me , it works.!",

            "answer": "Usually health issues surface because of underlying issues. We try to cure the issues on surface but choose to ignore the root causes behind them. Smoking not only harms our lungs but also pollute blood admist others. When one stops smoking, internal pollutants start acting up and even worse health issues surface. If you restart smoking, then the health goes off the wall. I was going through similar issues till I met Dr. Suyog Dandekar from health resort Prakruti. My trust on ayurveda let me to him. I managed my post-I-quit-smoking health issues with diet, exerices and GMY tablets by Prakruti JiyoFresh. Hope it works for you too. All the best buddy:)",

    "question": "I was diagnosed as type 2 diabetic 2.5 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I was 29 at the time and my fasting bg went from 100 in march to 300 in august 2012.\u00a0\u00a0I was able to get my a1c from 9 to 5.2 with a low carb diet an exercise alone.\u00a0\u00a0Last year my endo said I pretty much \"cured\" my diabetes with diet and exercise.\u00a0\u00a0now my weight has shot up 30 pounds since November and my cholesterol is almost 300.\u00a0\u00a0my current a1c is 5.8.\u00a0\u00a0I am 5'10\" and range from 190-210 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0I go to the gym pretty regularly and try to watch what I eat.\u00a0\u00a0I still stick to low carb for the most part but not as extreme as when I was first diagnosed.I have had a few other issues and I am wondering if this all could be related.A short history of my health issues over the years: When i was in college i had sever abdominal pains and blood in my urine on and off for about 2 weeks and the doctors diagnosed it as kidney stones each time but no stones showed up on 3 different CTs and I never passed the stones that I know of.\u00a0\u00a0The pain never returned. a few years later I had elevated liver enzymes and had a liver biapse which came back as a fatty liver.\u00a0\u00a0a few years later I started getting really clogged up ears during the fall and winter.\u00a0\u00a0I took nazel steroids and sudefed but they didn't help.\u00a0\u00a0Now my ears don't clog any longer but about a year ago I developed chronic tinitus and hearing lose even though I have never been subjected to loud noises on a regular basis.\u00a0\u00a0I have also had to go through physical therapy on and off for separate neck back and foot issues that came on suddenly with no injury.\u00a0\u00a0Strangely enough all of these things started six months after I quit smoking.I am wondering if any of this could be related to an underlying issue.\u00a0\u00a0maybe an undiagnosed auto immune issue. My doctors don't think they are related and treat each issue as it comes up.\u00a0\u00a0I think its strange that a reletivly healthy person in their late 20s/early 30s would suddenly develop all of these issues and have them all be completely unrelated.\u00a0\u00a0Its also very strange to go from normal blood sugar to full blown diabetes back to normal blood sugar with no meds.I do have bi annual blood and urine tests to monitor things.\u00a0\u00a0usually the only numbers that are out of normal ranges are cholesterol and a1c.Any suggestions on possible tests or other possible culprits would be greatly appreciated.",
