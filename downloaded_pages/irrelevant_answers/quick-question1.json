            "answer": "Hi!Well, any reading above 180 is not good, but since it is just above 180 its not bad either. Also, a fasting blood sugar of 132 is high. Just a single day\u2019s reading of 24 hours is not enough to diagnose a condition as it may be related to something you ate. You may be pre-diabetes or early diabetes. It is important to get a fasting blood sugar, PP blood sugar (two hours after meals), and Hb1Ac (to know your sugar control of last 3 months).Please consult your PCP for primary examination. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
