            "answer": "Are you on Flecainide for afib? Have you had any break-through afib while on your current dose? What is your current dose? Have you considered backing off your current dose to a lesser dose to see how you do rather than going off it all together?I was feeling very drugged on my 50 mg TID of Flecainide and hadn't had afib in months. So I asked my EP if I could back off to 50 mg BID. He had no problem with it and I felt great for about a week and then I started getting break-through afib. I had to up the dose again.This is just a suggestion but you could try to back off the drugs to see if maybe you don't need as much as you currently take or maybe, you don't need it at all. But approach it more slowly. Of course, all with your EPs approval!",

            "answer": "You must be so proud of yourself for trying to cutback the Flecainide. Most of us simply take side effects as part of the deal and you tried. Wow! The thing is now you don't have to wonder and you got peace of mind.I too have that drugged feeling while on Rhythmol and recently Flecainide. My daily exercise has been limited as I have so many side effects from this drug. In the medical world this is known as paying the price for maintaining sinus rhythm.Well, I am not going peaceful into the night. Doctors are not on the same page as me. They want the heart to be in rhthym and I want a quality day. Go figure.Thanks for serving as my inspiration.",

            "answer": "I certainly wouldn't say proud, I'm just trying to live a normal life. My primary goal was to function normally and not have break-through afib.You know, my EP started me on 100mg of Flecainide BID. I really could not function on that dose and I suggested the 50mg TID. He was fine with that dose and it really worked great for me for almost 2 years. Spreading the smaller dose across the day didn't give me all the drugged side effects, maintained a consistent level of the drug in my blood stream, and it was enough to control my afib. Could you request a change similar to this to maybe regain your quality of life?I since failed Flecainide and had a PVI ablation 3 weeks ago. I'm going for the permanent cure! My mom and her brother are in permanent afib and my brother was just diagnosed. I hope with this surgery that I can beat the family odds.Best of luck to you!",

I don't think any of these meds have any negative or positive affect on my irregular heartbeats so I sometimes wonder why I take my meds at all since my palps will happen when they want to :)",

I have PAC's all day all week. They seem to stop late at night and then return around the late morning. The worst part now is I'm really feeling them in my throat.

Your cardiologist needs to know about your hard week and how that manifests for you before he/she evaluates that you don't need a beta blocker. What happens to your anxiety level when you palp? Kind of what comes first, the chicken or the egg. What kind of thoughts do you have and do they contribute to your anxiety?I still think meds are a last resort.",

You will find your own formula and you will not only flunction but you will thrive.The first step is the biggest because it will turn things around. So you need to stop the negative momentum. My way will be different from your way because you will create your own formula.Is there a place you know of, maybe an activity, maybe a thought, maybe a person, where you feel that you get a little break from your symptoms/side effects? For example, no matter how bad I felt, and it was awful, I exercised at a local club. Getting on my sneakers and start dressing was a major hurdle. When I got to the club, I still felt awful, while exercising, awful, stretching after, awful. Getting in the car with the thought of \"Gee, I did it\" started the slight relief. It was only slight but it was noticeable.My point was if I did nothing, the momentum would carry me into bad, really bad. I had to create my \"something\" and exercise was it. I never missed a day no matter what. It was a contract I made with myself, my \"something.\"Thank you for reading. I care about you and take the first step of thinking about \"something\" and don't do it yet. Just think about it.Blessings,",

Get with your doctor and see if he/she can give you the prescribed activated form of ubiquinone (much cheaper for you usually) - you can check with the pharmacy of your choice to see if they have it in stock and verify with your medical coverage to see if they cover it.Google ubiquinone, CoQ10... here is some general information to start from website:http://www.ahealthyme.com/GetHerbContent.do?primerid=21682&name=Coenzyme%20Q10%20(CoQ10)\"In general, CoQ 10 appears to be extremely safe. No significant side effects have been found, even in studies that lasted a year. 44,79 However, people with severe heart disease should not take CoQ 10 (or any other supplement) except under a doctor's supervision.As noted above, two studies suggest that CoQ 10 might reduce blood sugar levels in people with diabetes. 45 While this could potentially be helpful for treatment of diabetes, it might present a risk as well; people with diabetes who are using CoQ 10 might inadvertently push their blood sugar levels dangerously low. However, another trial in people with diabetes found no effect on blood sugar control. 46,58 The bottom line: If you have diabetes, make sure to track your blood sugar closely if you start taking CoQ 10 (or, indeed, any herb or supplement).Interactions You Should Know AboutYou may need more CoQ 10 if you are taking:Cholesterol-lowering drugs in the statin familyRed yeast riceBeta-blockers (specifically propranololmetoprolol , and alprenolol )Antipsychotic drugs in the phenothiazine familyTricyclic antidepressantsMethyldopaHydrochlorothiazideClonidineHydralazineOral diabetes drugs (especially glyburide, phenformin, and tolazamide)You should not take CoQ 10 except on a physician's advice if you are taking:Coumadin (warfarin)CoQ 10 might improve general sense of well-being, but worsen peripheral neuropathy symptoms if you are taking:Reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (for HIV infection) \"",
