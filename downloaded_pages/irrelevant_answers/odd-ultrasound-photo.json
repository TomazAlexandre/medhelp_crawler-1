It's the actual doctor who does all the measuring and checking. She all ways says everything is normal and the baby's weight is normal and development is looking exceptional. So I always leave feeling good but the photo just threw me off a little bit.",

Like the top lip looks super huge compared to the bottom. Maybe he's sucking his bottom lip? Or maybe the angle. But it has me a bit worried. Anyone have a odd photo and baby looked fine when born?",
