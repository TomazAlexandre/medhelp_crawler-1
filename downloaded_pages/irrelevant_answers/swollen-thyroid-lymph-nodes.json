            "answer": "If you have antibodies you probably have a sub-clinical (not showing up on your thyroid levels) autoimmune thyroid condition going on.\u00a0\u00a0Unless you are on an old fashioned HMO, you should not be unable to go to a specialist on your own.\u00a0\u00a0Find an endocrinologist who specializes in thyroid conditions (most only deal with diabetes) or a good ENT.\u00a0\u00a0The swollen lymph nodes could just be due to an unidentified infection, the thyroiditis, or could be something more.\u00a0\u00a0You need additional testing and imaging studies (ultrasound, CT scan, etc.).Don't be afraid to push past your doctor's recommendations to just continue with the meds.\u00a0\u00a0If you feel there is something more going on (and obviously you do or you wouldn't be here) insist on a referral or just get one on your own.You are your own best health care advocate!Utahmommapapillary carcinoma",

    "question": "About two months ago I went to the doctor because there was this constant chocking sensation in my throat as if something was pushing on my windpipe/esophagus.\u00a0\u00a0He checked the area and stated that my thyroid was really swollen.\u00a0\u00a0He ran some tests and my TSH levels were normal but at the very low side and the antibody test came back positive for antibodies.\u00a0\u00a0He started me on synthroid two months ago but I still have that chocking sensation.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know how long before the swelling goes down?\u00a0\u00a0My doctor won't send me to a specialist and just has me continuing the meds.\u00a0\u00a0Also for quite some time before I noticied the chocking sensation I had multiple lymph nodes in my throat swelling now they are still swollen and so are ones in my armpit.\u00a0\u00a0They can't find a cause for the swollen glands could they be swollen due to the thyroid?",
