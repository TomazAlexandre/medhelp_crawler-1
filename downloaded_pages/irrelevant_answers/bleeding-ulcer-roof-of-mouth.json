            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, as Caregiver said, it could be malignant ulcer. One cannot ignore this possibility at all. However any ulcer that is constantly irritated and touched will erode deeper into the mucosa and will become a bleeding ulcer. It could also be due to long standing fungal infection or due to acid reflux hitting at that point. In people with diabetes this is a common problem. Poor oral hygiene too prevents an ulcer from healing. Deficiency of minerals, vitamin B, smoking, chemical irritation by tooth pastes etc can also be the cause. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please consult your doctor and try and get a referral for an oral surgeon. Scrapings from this ulcer will need to be sent for testing. Meanwhile please do not suck on the ulcer, try and avoid spicy and too salty food, and try maintaining good oral hygiene. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",
