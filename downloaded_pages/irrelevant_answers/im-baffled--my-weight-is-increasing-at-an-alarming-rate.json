            "answer": "I agree that you should get your thyroid levels tested... Hypothyroidism is often a cause of sudden, unexplained weight gain.\u00a0\u00a0Be sure you get a full thyroid panel, that includes Free T3 and Free T4, along with TSH; don't settle for just that TSH that many doctors will do and tell you is sufficient.Also ask for thyroid antibodies to determine if you have Hashimoto's, which is the number 1 cause of hypothyroidism in the developed world.\u00a0\u00a0The tests you need for that are Thyroid Peroxidase Antibodies (TPOab) and Thyroglobulin Antibodies (TgAb)... Be sure to get them both, or you could be misdiagnosed.You might also ask to get tested for Type II diabetes or insulin resistance/metabolic syndrome, which is another cause of weight gain/inability to lose.",
