It's just the journey you'll have to take if it gets officially diagnosed. Please pay close attention to your Dr and take it serious. Don't beat yourself up, you didn't fail, a medical test just suggested an intervention might be needed. But YOU didn't fail :)",

Depends on the doc for what they diagnose when it's in the middle line that.\u00a0\u00a0No high risk appointments or anything for me- just some minor diet changes (more protein and veggies- less carbs) and add in some mild exercise. Do that and you'll be fine:)",

I'd have a talk with your Dr so they can make you feel better because I think your test came out well and you shouldn't be feeling bad about it. They should have discussed it with you at your test so you didn't have this needless worry. Congrats on your little one : )",
