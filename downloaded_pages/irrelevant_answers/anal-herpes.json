    "question": "- I am a 30 year old male.- Had unprotected sex with my girlfriend 40 days prior to symptoms- Diagnosed with Candida & Thrush- Self Diagnosed symptoms of Balanitis ( need to go back to dr to confirm )- I am a strong candidate for Diabetes as it runs in the family- Going through ALLOT of stress at the moment, from break up and moving*** Symptoms all started the day we broke up as I was stressed out ****23 days later is when I am writing this.My candida is dying off and I am getting an itching feeling on my anus.\u00a0\u00a0I looked in a mirror and not around my anus but after spreading my anus I was able to see some white zits ( size of a pin head ) , I say zits because I get cold sores on my lip and these didnt look anything like that or pictures of Herpes.I decided to touch one and proceed to pot it.\u00a0\u00a0Rather than a liquid coming out as with a cold sore a white paste pushed out as if it was a zit.My question:- Is this herpes?- Is this part of my Candida?- or is this natural in the rectal cavity?ALSO:With my Candida it looks like I have Balanitis where I had for less than 48hrs small red bumps underneath the head of my penis.I am circumcised.Question:- The red bumps did not have any fluid in them, nor did they burst or scab over.\u00a0\u00a0They just went away with in less than 48hrs.\u00a0\u00a0Could this be herpes?",
