            "answer": "Sounds like it is time for a new Dr.\u00a0\u00a0What the one now is doing is not wrong they just dont seem to have the time to do it correctly and fast enough.\u00a0\u00a0You can reassure your son that it is NOT him.\u00a0\u00a0It is very hard to find a good Endo in my area but you have to keep looking and getting referrals etc until you find one that you like and has time for you.\u00a0\u00a0Tell your GP that you are not happy with the current one and you want another referral.\u00a0\u00a0They should have no problems filling that request.\u00a0\u00a0First Dr. that I had was GREAT but she had no time for me so I had to switch.\u00a0\u00a0Then I found a couple lousy ones and finally settled in on one that is pretty good.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the problem is that Diabetes is not rocket science.\u00a0\u00a0There is not one solution to the problem you have to be willing to think outside the box and find the solution that works for that particular patient.\u00a0\u00a0Everyone reacts differently to different treatments.\u00a0\u00a0Another alternative is to tell the Dr. that you are not happy with the speed of changes and control of the diabetes and see if he/she is willing to make an appointment and try to change things.\u00a0\u00a0If not go elsewhere and get what you need.",

    "question": "hi kevin ,my son does have a endocrindogist but we can only see him once every 3 months,inbetween we have to phone the childrens diabetes specialist nurse,i phoned 2day and discussed the ongoing problems again but have been told to lower his insulin level am from 23 to 20 to stop the hypos and wait a week to see if his levels get higher if they do (which they will)as been down this road before,i then have to phone back and tell them.they also said if this happens they dont know what they will do next.recently spoke to our local gp about this and she wrote the endocrindogist a stinking letter about them letting this go on for so long with the highs and lows and asked them to change his insulin to long acting with fast acting before meals .but as yet still waiting his next appointment is end of feb with endocrindogist.i hope he will change his insulin as my son really thinks he is doing it wrong but he sticks to his diet and he does get down about the constant change in levels.i cant blame him ,i would as well.i really believe it all comes down to sticking to their budgets....thanks again.",
