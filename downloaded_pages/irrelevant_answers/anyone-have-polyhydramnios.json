I'm now 34 weeks but at 32 weeks baby was measuring 5.5lbs and my uterus was measuring 37 weeks. I'm really worried I'm going to have a huge baby as my first was 8 lb 5 oz and I'm only a small person, I'm really struggling with the pregnancy as I'm sooo big x",

            "answer": "Actually, the range is 5cm to 25cm. 24cm would be considered \"high normal\". It is variable though. Meaning one moment it could be 24cm, measure again minutes later get 26cm, and measure again minutes later and get 23cm. It's a semi quantitative assessment of fluid volume. At least your not over 30cm.",
