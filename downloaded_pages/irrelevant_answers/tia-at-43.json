            "answer": "Hi.A transient ischemic attack is basically a warning sign that a stroke can occur in the future and it provides the opportunity to prevent a stroke from occurring. However, based on the criteria for diagnosing a TIA, the symptoms should have resolved within 24 hours.Your symptoms might probably be more related to the cause of your TIA rather than as the after-effects of it.It would be advisable to treat any condition that might be a risk factor for stroke, including hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, hypercholesterolemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, blood disorders, sleep apnea, migraine, obesity, carotid and peripheral artery disease.What you can do is to modify your lifestyle, including smoking and drug or alcohol intake cessation, limiting intake of cholesterol, fat, and sodium, exercising regularly, eating fruits and vegetables, and maintaining a healthy weight.You should consult a physician at the earliest possible time.Good luck.",
