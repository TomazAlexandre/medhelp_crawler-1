            "answer": "Thanks for the responses. Sandy- Sorry you're feeling this way too, it's terrible!! Frank- Over the past two years I've eaten healthy and not so healthy, been as active as possible and been a lazy bum ect. Any changes to my lifestyle do nothing to help the way I feel unfortunately. I do find that working and being active I can push through the intense fatigue into a zombie-like state where I can function and do work but am still lacking energy. Also I should note I can have severe mood swings, and my mood is affected by the people around me usually. Stressful situation make the fatigue worse as well.Sorry for the long explanations and such, thanks for taking the time to read and answer!",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Extreme fatigue could be due to anemia, diabetes, hypothyroidism, low testosterone, or due to kidney or liver problems. Another possibility is sleep disturbances (like sleep apnea, imbalance of rapid eye and non rapid eye movement sleep etc.). You may sleep your customary 7-8 hours and yet feel fatigued. You need sleep studies to rule this out. Other possibilities are chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, low Vit b12, low iron, low calcium, sodium and potassium. Hyperthyroidism too causes increased sweating and tiredness.\u00a0\u00a0 Postviral fatigue syndrome is another possibility. Persisting EBV infection or mono can also be the cause. Most of these can also make you dizzy on standing up. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "For quite a while now, maybe 2 years, I haven't felt normal. By that I mean clear minded, alert, and myself personality wise. When I wake up I'm very, VERY rarely refreshed feeling and it takes an hour or two to feel somewhat awake. (Keep in mind this is in comparison to how I felt before, \"normal\"). Usually in the afternoon I'm overwhelmed by fatigue and it's difficult to carry on with people and activities. If I don't rest in a quiet and stress-free environment I usually don't come out of the lethargic, foggy minded fatigue. Also, the effect of alcohol is much different. It doesn't take as much to feel the effects but instead of feeling good, happy, relaxed ect I feel even more out of it and it makes my outlook on life seem bleak. Needless to say I don't touch the stuff anymore.I'm not sure if this is related but I get the urge to urinate very often and I also have an increased thirst, whether these are because of each other I don't know, but it seems that way.I have no medical coverage and have yet to see a doctor. I have had a blood test and it's not diabetes and my thyroid was alright, but I've heard that even if your levels are in the good that doesn't mean you're ok. As in they're dropping or something. I'm thinking chronic fatigue syndrome is the bastardly culprit here which *****, because there's no \"cure\" for it :/",
