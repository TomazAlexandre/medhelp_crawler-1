            "answer": "Hi Dawniem,I am a Type 1 diabetic but not a doctor. I was diagnosed with diabetes as a teenager when i stopped producing insulin. Personally when my blood sugar is running high (normal is between 70-120mg/dl) I feel somewhat light headed as well as sick to my stomache. In addition quite fatigued. You do not mention any other systoms such as frequent urination or extreme thirst which are also signs of high blood sugar and possible diabetes. My suggestion is you go back to see your doctor a lot can change over 1year.Feeling dizzy can be symptoms for quite a number of illnesses.Hope this helps and you feel better soon Carolyn",

            "answer": "I'm a volunteer here, not a medical professional, and I have had diabetes for 11 years. I also have felt dizzy on numerous occasions but have never really linked it to diabetes itself. I agree with CG's comment that dizziness could be a symptom for many other illnesses. It is interesting, though, that you say you experience this feeling after eating. Are you taking any medications, especially any that you take before or right after eating, that could be causing this dizziness? I had an experience like that once. As soon as my doctor took me off the medication my dizziness stopped. At other times my doctors couldn't determine exactly what was causing my dizziness and they seemed to get more frustrated than me, not being able to pin point it. Usually they would give me the prescription drug \"meclizine\" and that would solve the problem. I do not recommend that as a solution to you by any means -just sharing my experience to illustrate that the cause of dizziness is not always diagnosed, or is diagnosed incorrectly.I'm not quite convinced that it's diabetes that is causing your dizziness, especially since you say it was ruled out a year ago, but to be on the safe side have your doctor check your glucose again. If it turns out ok then talk to your doctor about any other possible causes. It may be worthwile to consider seeing an ENT doctor as it could be an ear problem (like a middle ear infection), a neurologist, or even a GI (gastrointestinal) doctor, since it seems to be happening after eating -maybe it's a digestion issue. I know I sometimes feel dizzy when I'm nauseous after eating. And as CG mentioned above, high sugars do make you feel light headed (as do low sugars -anything out of normal range), but since you don't mention any other symptoms associated with diabetes it seems there's something else causing your dizziness.Let us know of the outcome and feel better!",

            "answer": "Hi, I have the same problem actually and am experiencing it right now as I type - about 30 minutes after eating.\u00a0\u00a0I believe my issue is caused from insulin resistance (pre-diabetic condition).\u00a0\u00a0At present my body makes insulin but the interplay between my blood sugar levels and my pancreas releasing insulin is more like a slam dance vs. a waltz.\u00a0\u00a0I experience \"morning syndrome\" also.\u00a0\u00a0At about 4-5 am I wake up feeling jittery & dizzy.\u00a0\u00a0In my case, I believe my blood sugars get low (either from not eating or over-releasing insulin) then my body releases sugars from the liver (including cortisol & adrenaline)...and on and on the dance goes.\u00a0\u00a0I get a jittery/buzzy/vibrating feeling when this is going on.\u00a0\u00a0I monitor my blood sugar regularly & have actually captured this interplay (the bouncing) accompanied by the jitters as my blood sugars go up.\u00a0\u00a0Unlike some people whose blood sugar fluctuates wildly with diabetes my body keeps my sugar in a very tight window, all the time.\u00a0\u00a0From about 95mg/dl to about 110 mg/dl.\u00a0\u00a0On occasion I have caught it going as high as 180mg/dl (during a religious fast).\u00a0\u00a0So if I had to guess, I'd say one possibility is that your body is doing the same as mine...over responding and trying to keep your insulin levels \"normal\" with a very unharmonious release of both sugars (by diet or liver) and pancreas over compensating.\u00a0\u00a0 The good news is that a diet of meat and green, with a small portion of healthy carbs like a small potato, whole grain slice of bread, etc. quells the jolt a bit.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck",

            "answer": "Hey :) Just another Diabetic, not a doctor. I'm 16 years old and was diagnosed two months ago. Thats how I felt a lot, I also urinated frequently and was constantly thirsty. MY friends even made fun of me because of how often I used the restroom. But whenever I eat something high in sugars, I normally just want to sleep. All last year for instance, I'd pass out in 5th and 6th periods, you should probably get checked again",

            "answer": "Hi there,I've been having the same symptoms and I am certain it has nothing to do with blood sugar. I've know a couple of people that feel dizzy or drunk like after eating, which is due to a candida infection in the body.Everybody has candida, but this bacteria often gets out of control, specially when you eat lots of sugar and carbs (which it feeds on).My recommendation is to try a sugar free diet, drink LOTS OF WATER, brush your teeth every time you eat, and take Caprylic Acid, they sell it at Trader Joes, Whole Foods, or any vitamin store.Read this article bout candida, the symptoms vary, and you don't have to have them all to have candida:http://www.holistichelp.net/candida.html",

            "answer": "Wow Deb, you just totally described exactly what I'm going through. It was my sister (She has a diabetic son and husband) who suggested I start watching my blood sugar. I did track it for a week about 6 months ago but since I only caught it out of whack once, my doc dismissed it. I had a glucose test as well and it came back normal. It went away for a few months and is now back. For the last month, after I eat something with refined carbs like bread or pasta, I get jittery, lightheaded, and nauseous. Then I get a massive headache for about an hour. I do go the restroom alot, but I also make it a point to make myself drink 2 liters of water a day and I thought that was the reason why. I started checking my glucose with a meter and will continue to do so over the next couple of weeks as well as journal everything I eat. I'm frustrated that my doctor just blow this off and I'm tired of feeling like crap all the time. I'm glad to know I'm not the only one and I'm not crazy as I think my doctor thinks I am.",

            "answer": "I had the same symptoms and was tested for everything under the sun (diabetes, spine trauma, cancer, etc.) after a year and alot of frustration I finally had a live blood analysis which showed I had an overgrowth of yeast in my blood stream which is called Candidea. The odd part is that I didn't have any other symptoms which are typical to Candidea except the dizziness/drunken feelings. After modifying my diet to remove all simple sugars and carbs I started feeling better within a week. Now, I can enjoy an alcoholic drink on occasion or a dessert, but have to limit it to once a month. I know from going through this process that there are many things that traditional testing does not pick-up. In fact, even the live blood analysis didn't show an extreme overgrowth, just a slight one. But even slight imbalances can make us feel awful. My recommendation to anyone experiencing these symptoms is to eat only vegetables and lean protein for a month, after that introduce fruit, but be very weary of any refined flour or sugar. There are a number of Candidea diets online if you need help finding recipes. Many incorporate yeast killing agents like Coconut Oil, etc.",
