            "answer": "Be careful with the over eating. U shouldn't increase ur food intake till ur in the 2nd trimester. U do get cravings but try to fight thru them n keep a healthy low fat n low calorie diet especially in the 1st trimester. It's actually just in ur head. It's the excitement of being pregnant n all. But remember it maybe all cute to think oh I'm eating for 2 in the beginning but if u over eat ur pregnancy will turn so painful at the end. U won't be able to walk n have so much back pain or even get diabetes. Doct recommend that u just increase ur food intake by 300 calories towards the end of ur 2nd trimester. B4 then the food is not really going to the baby as he is feeding off the sac only. All of it is just going to u. Now doc won't really say anything abt ur weight until the last trimester n by then there is very little u can do to improve it. N ull be in so much more pain then u would have if u maintained a healthy diet. But it's up to u if u want to have an easy healthy pregnancy or a painful one. Cuz ur diet n exercise make a huge difference in that. Oh also when ppl tell u it doesn't matter what u eat cuz ur pregnant or as long as ur doc doesn't say anything that's just bs.. it does matter it will change ur pregnancy experience and make it a less painful one. N u won't be as tired also.",
