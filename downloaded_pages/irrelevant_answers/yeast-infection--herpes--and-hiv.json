    "question": "I've been having chronic yeast infections, and my doctor is recommending tests for diabetes and HIV. I've never been exposed to HIV as far as I know. I was just reading online that the antibodies that build up in your body for herpes can give a positive result on a HIV test. I do get cold sores aka the herpes 1 virus. Can this really affect my HIV test?Would those antibodies coupled with yeast infection make me HIV positive or diagnosed with aids?",
