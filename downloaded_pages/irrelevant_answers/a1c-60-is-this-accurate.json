    "question": "Hi all,I had some annual blood work last week and to my surprise my doctor said im a prediabetic and that my A1C is 6.0. im 27 5'6 175 (muscle). After reviewing my results i found it odd that my A1C is 6.0 and my Glucose level was 84 mg/dl. To add to my suspicion my job made us to blood work last month and my Glucose level was at 80 mg/dL. A1C was not measured on this exam. Do you think I should re-test? This seems strange but then again this is all very new to me. Please any insight would be very helpful.",
