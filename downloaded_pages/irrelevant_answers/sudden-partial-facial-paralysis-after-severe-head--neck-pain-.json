            "answer": "The condition warrants a visit to a neurologist and a consult. Much less expensive than an ER visit.\u00a0\u00a0It is called Bell's Palsy and results from a palsy of several cranial nerves. It takes about a week to develop and usually goes away after two to four months, stabile for most of the period and then a gradual recession of symptoms until they disappear, but some cases are, unfortunately permanant. Often connected with a severe earache. It is usually due to a viral infection, typically Herpes Zoster, but sometimes is due to an infarct on the nerves. Psychologally it is very disturbing. Treatment is generally with an anti-viral medication, vitamin C, and a steroid.",

            "answer": "Thank you for the reply.\u00a0\u00a0I had read near the same response to a similar question before posting, though was sure it was TMD related.\u00a0\u00a0Though that CB response I read from someone else made me wonder.I have health coverage, so a lack of ER visit is not financial, rather I am all the animals that I care for and love like my kids have.\u00a0\u00a0The last two ER visits I was admitted for C Diff. Which left the animals alone for 4 days INDOORS!\u00a0\u00a0The second time 2 mos ago was my heart and I was nearly commanded to stay but only 1.5 days, and I had surely prepped them beforehand.\u00a0\u00a0I live a good 20 acres from Amish with no phones and am a Wildlife Rehabber, but i hold a special permit for some Non Releasable \"fur kids\" that again are my kids and I keep people away from naturally as they are in my care to love & pretext, not entertain society.\u00a0\u00a0So its a fear of being again trapped in a hospital with no one for the animals.The back side of head, neck & TM joint on the RT is very soar, and as usual into my shoulder.\u00a0\u00a02 wks ago, he hard bump under my RT ear was acting up, so I put a Q-top in my ear and got out blood (enough to fill 2 small Q-tip).\u00a0\u00a0This had happened 2 yrs ago (identical) and my M.D. accused me of pushing too hard, which I did not.\u00a0\u00a0I seldom use Q tips and seldom get out anything in way of wax.I have UC & Chrons Disease (DX early 80's).\u00a0\u00a0I get the ulcers on side of my tongue that last for 1-3 mos, stomach ulcers flare upon severe stress and Asacol HD is taken for that and I get ulcers in the rectum intermittently.\u00a0\u00a0I've been tested for a Herpes Zoster and never have had a positive.\u00a0\u00a0I've never had a cold soar or any indication of a stage of Herpes.\u00a0\u00a0That is good as my immune system is not well.Anyway, I have a cervical & soft tissue MRI on file, waiting for me.\u00a0\u00a0My last MRI 2010 showed stage 3 internal jugular Lmyphnodes enlarged though not at pathological criteria.\u00a0\u00a0I have many painful to numb balls or knots around my neck & jaw that I am 8 mos past due for having checked via MRI.I am considering heading to ER, and maybe they would run the MRI there too?\u00a0\u00a0I just don't want to get stuck there for days.Thank you again,Amy",

            "answer": "Having read the symptoms of your mouth going droopy and feeling paralyzed, Bell's Palsy.\u00a0\u00a0Take care with your eye, because if you are not able to close the eye lid that can cause the eye to dry.\u00a0\u00a0You would have to ask your doctor with regard to keeping your eye from not drying.\u00a0\u00a0He may prescribe a lubricant or eye drops.With regard to you clenching and grinding your teeth (Bruxism), I would suggest that your make an appointment with your dentist or orthodontist who can make shields, or one shield to place over your bottom row of teeth.\u00a0\u00a0This will help with regard the grinding and wearing your down your teeth and will also help alleviate\u00a0\u00a0the pains that you are getting in your jaw.\u00a0\u00a0The pains from grinding and clenching the teeth can also cause headaches.For your blurry eye problem, it may be the case that you are overtiring your eyes by glaring at the computer for too long and not getting enough rest and sleep.Vision disturbance can also be caused by diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But as your eye test was fine, then there is no damage due to diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0But it may be worth getting your blood checked out for diabetes, or doing a glucose test to see if your are intolerant to glucose.As you are experiencing a lot of gastric problems and getting ulcers, it may be a good idea to get tested for Helicobacter Pylori.\u00a0\u00a0The most accurate test for this is by having a breath test.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes a stool test is taken, but blood tests for the bacteria is not accurate and can give inaccurate results.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "Thank you, you were right on in so many ways.\u00a0\u00a0I'm glad you brought up the H Pylori as I was DX w/ UC in early 1980's and never have been tested.\u00a0\u00a0Each of my GI-Ent's blew off my request.\u00a0\u00a0I sure seems the test for it has become quick.\u00a0\u00a0And, WOW, the TMJ pain is getting crazy, I will consult this week with a NEW dentist to not get blown off to my Orthopedic who is only below the neck.Update:\u00a0\u00a0Tomorrow is 2 wks since I went to TWO ER's.\u00a0\u00a0The first DX w/ Bells Palsy and said nothing will help.\u00a0\u00a0The Second DX Bells Palsy & suspected Shingles with giving me Pred, Norco & Anti Viral med.\u00a0\u00a0The movement came back to face almost all the way within a week.\u00a0\u00a0Jaw and head pain continue, so I will address and ask primary DR for H Pylori test.Thank you,Amy",

    "question": "Hello and thank you for your time!11 days ago I had an extensive eye exam after having much blurred vision and onset of blind spots while laying down using iphone as computer at night.\u00a0\u00a0Upon the exam, I had to hold my head in a way that brought on neck muscle and head pain instantly.\u00a0\u00a0I was in so much head, neck & jaw pain since that exam that I've not been out of the house to order reading glasses yet.\u00a0\u00a0Of corse my vision was good at the eye exam!The pain kept moving around and pretty clear TMD via my seriously \"off\" bite was being affected?\u00a0\u00a0I also have been on continual narcotic meds, neurontin and Lyrica since 2005 when the neck, jaw & head pain was chronic.\u00a0\u00a0I also have an order for 6th MRI for cervical soft tissue to check Lmyphnodes & HARD knots under to behind my ears.\u00a0\u00a0I cancelled the MRI from last week as I was in too much pain to drive.\u00a0\u00a0I have also been under loads of stress and grief from loss of my only moral support system.\u00a0\u00a0Psychotically, I have been in care for stress & sadness which makes me grind my teeth at night and clench my jaw.\u00a0\u00a0Though I try not to as it is painful.On day 8 my mouth felt weird and by day 9, the right side of my mouth was droopy and paralyzed?\u00a0\u00a0When I smile, only the LT side moves.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot blow up either cheeks with air nor can I hold H2O in either cheek.\u00a0\u00a0Vision is very blurry right now (especially RT eye) and the RT outer ear (cartilage) has been intermittently aching like it was crushed.\u00a0\u00a0The eyes seem to trade off on which is most blurry.\u00a0\u00a0And immediately after I may down, my sight is really bad.The last 2 nights I took Lorazapam 1 mg and the pain was much better at night and in morning.\u00a0\u00a0It seemed to work as muscle relaxant?\u00a0\u00a0It is now 22 hrs past taking it and the pain is all over again.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it sounds like a TMI?\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if such inflammation has pinched a nerve?Would you suggest an ER visit?Thank you again",
