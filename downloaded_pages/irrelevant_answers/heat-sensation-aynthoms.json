            "answer": "Just took blood work including B12. Results didn't come in yet. Been taking lots of blood work from different docs and my glucose serum is really high normal. Also had a 2hr. glucose tolerance test. High normal. Docs say I have Rheumatoid arthritis but I may have Lupus. Seeing a new doc this week. I have fibromyalgia. Along with the heat sensation, I get prickling pins/needles all over my body. The pain is so bad from it. I don't know what's going on with me. My serum calcium has been elevated not too bad for the past several years and now my parathyroid level is high this month. If there's no parathyroid tumor, then I don't know what it can be. Taking a nuclear and ct scan this week. I've lost 48lbs. unintentionally since mid Feb.of this year.What else could the heat come from if it's not the nerves?",
