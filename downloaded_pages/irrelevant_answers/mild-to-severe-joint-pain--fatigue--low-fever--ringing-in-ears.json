            "answer": "That has been my life for the past three months. I went nuts, not about the symptoms, but about the fact that nobody had a clue how to help me, and I was really out of it. At times so much that I could not stand for even more than 5 minutes. It was the unspoken conclusion of the docs that it was all in my head. To prove them wrong, I took lorazepam, and the symtoms persisted. So one day, after lots of researching, I started an elimination diet. After six days of eliminating, my symptoms cleared up! I could not believe it!! Unfortunately, I got food poisoning before I could get through the rechallenge part, but once I started eating normally, the symptoms returned. Now I avoid food additives and certain other triggers, because I know they make me feel miserable.The other causative factor was a chronic simus infection that I did not notice I had, or just got used to having. A short course of a strong antibiotic helped to clear up my residual symptoms of muscle pain, abdominal pain, temple pain, and all the rest.This has worked for me, and your symptoms may have a different cause. But I'm putting this out there for you, because I know you have to think outside the box in order to find relief. Perhaps an alternative practitioner, or an allergy specialist may be able to assist you. Be discriminating when you choose them, though.",

    "question": "For six weeks now I have been experiencing mild to severe joint pain, fatigue, low fever, ringing in ears.\u00a0\u00a0I respond to ibuprofen, and steroids, but my RH factor tests have returned negative.\u00a0\u00a0I've also been tested for lupus, gout, lymes disease, diabetes...and more!\u00a0\u00a0Everything comes back negative.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen five different doctors who seem to always disagree with each other's diagnosis and I don't know who to believe since I don't have a family doctor any longer.\u00a0\u00a0The one I had been going to for over 20 years passed away a couple of years ago. I started accupuncture today with hope that over time it may have a positive effect on the pain.\u00a0\u00a0 I have a shelf full of pill bottles, but not sure which ones to continue taking.I'm very depressed thinking I'll always feel this way and am not sure where to go next.\u00a0\u00a0If anyone has any ideas I am very grateful!",
