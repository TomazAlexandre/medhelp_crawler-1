            "answer": "I am having kind of similar problems - see my recent post about Lupus. I have frequent urination, hair loss, my feet and hands feel swollen sometimes but does not look like it - maybe imagining this. Also I bruise pretty easily indicating low WBC. I think it might have something to do with hormones. I would check this too and do those other tests you mentioned for thyroid, lupus etc.",

The doctors have asked me several times if they are really swollen i think they were headed for Lupus because they told me your symptom of your hands and feet feelin swollen\u00a0\u00a0is a classic of lupus.\u00a0\u00a0 Are you on any medicine? I read they medicine given for Lupus can cause hair loss. I am not on anything.\u00a0\u00a0I go for more blood work soon. And to see a different kind of doctor. Hope I am not bald by the time they figure this out.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks again Tami",

            "answer": "No I'm not on any medicine. However, Lupus by itself can cause hair loss - it is an autoimmune disease meaning it turns against growing cells and tissue including hair. A lupus 'flare' (when all the symptoms occur) is believed to be triggered by an imbalance of hormones among other causes. Lupus.org has a ton of info. There are apparently several other symptoms including a rash across the cheeks especially in women (butterfly shape). Still, it could be several other things, you need to get tested to make sure (and so do I!).Why did your doctor say you have the 'start' of diabetes and high glucose levels? 70-90 is normal glucose level, even upto 110. I believe diabetes can also trigger some of these symptoms such as hair loss, frequent urination and excessive thirst, fatigue. Not sure about swollen feet and hands though.Also some minor condition in combination with stress can lead to a lot of symptoms. So don't worry yet. Again, only way to make sure is to get tested. I am getting tested next week for everything.",

Thanks for keeping me company online.\u00a0\u00a0I get my result around the 11th of sept. then i go to see a different kind of doctor maybe they will test for thyroid again then.\u00a0\u00a0Let me know how your test go. goodluck.",
