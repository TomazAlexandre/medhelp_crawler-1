    "question": "I'm 34 year old woman 5'7, 121 pounds with Type 1 diabetes for 30 years my diabetes is controlled and have been on an insulin pump for 2 years.I have also been on Synthroid for 11 years after having my first child I have been on the same dose (0.1mg) up until right after having my fourth child then it changed (0.088mg) for a month and then it went back to the original dose (0.1mg).I have been feeling bad and having lots of symptoms through those 4 years after having my last child thinking that it had to be my thyroid would see my family doctor and my endocrinologist and would tell them how I was feeling so they they would check my TSH and always tell me it was in normal rangesThis last February one of the nurses knew I was not feeling well having lots of symptoms so she suggested a thyroid antibody test had the test done and my Thyroglobulin AB was 2034.0 (normal range 0.0-40.0) also my AntiMicrosomal AB was 1000.0 (normal range 0.0-35.0).Shorlty after I was diagnosed with Hashimoto's thyroditis my endocrinologist said my thyroid was completely gone nothing left. He raised my dosage of synthroid to 0.112mg. Had my TSH and also my\u00a0\u00a0FreeT4 rechecked in April my TSH came back as 1.37 and Free T4 as 1.8. Saw the doctor last week again said the ranges looked good, but I explained to him I was still symptomatic (hair still coming out, heart palpitations, extremely tired, muscle aches, joint pain, not sleeping well, down, not a lot of energy, cold) and he was concerned that I was still having symptoms at the this time, but I felt better after 2 weeks of taking the new dose (0.112mg) but then started feeling bad again so he had my TSH, T4, and T3 checked again plus he wanted me checked for Addison's. My test for Addison's came back negative, but my TSH came back as 1.99, Free T4 1.6, and Free T3 2.4 to which the endocrinologist said the ranges were fine and there was no need for dosage adjustment and to come back in November. When I first found out I had Hashimoto's my endocrinologist told me my levels should be as close to 1 as possible so I'm a bit confused as to why he didn't change my dosage at this last visit. Does this make sense to you?Would appreciate any suggestions as to what to do now I don't feel like I can keep managing to feel the way I still do especially with having four young children.Also do you know of any Holistic or natural doctors that deal with Armour in Wichita, Kansas?Thank you for you time,Renee",
