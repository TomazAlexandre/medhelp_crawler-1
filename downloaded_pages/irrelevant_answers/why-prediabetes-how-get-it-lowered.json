            "answer": "Hello and welcome!If you could give us an idea of what your blood sugar levels are running, that would help.Losing weight is one of THE most important things (if not the #1 thing)\u00a0\u00a0you can do to get your glucose levels under control and to keep the pre-diabetes from advancing to a Type II diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Diet management is important too, but it isn't just as easy as decreasing or cutting out \"sugars\", that's because there are many different KINDS of sugars, some are worse than others in the context of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0It can be a little complex at first.My recommendation would be to ask your doctor for a referral to a nutritionist/dietician, who can help you with both the weight loss, AND the diet modifications relating to the pre-diabetes (sugars, carbs, fats, etc)Best of luck, stop in and let us know how you're doing!",
