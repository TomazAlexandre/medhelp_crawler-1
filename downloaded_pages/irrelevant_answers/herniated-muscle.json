            "answer": "Dear Sheri:I guess the first question to ask is, do you have diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0If not then you have few worries about the wound healing problems that accompany diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In this case, surgery is likely the best option, although I am uncertain about what herniated muscle means.\u00a0\u00a0We usual talk in terms of muscle herniating though a plane of another tissue such as another muscle, diaphragm muscle, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Usually, surgery is the only method of cure, while other means can palliate the condition, they will not cure or reverse the problem.\u00a0\u00a0Depending on which muscle is herniating through what other structure, we worry about compromising the blood supply to that muscle that can cause problems.Even if you had diabetes, the surgery can and would take precautions to promote wound healing and there should be few problems.Sincerely,CCF Neuro MD",

    "question": "I have a herniated muscle on the outer side of my calf. It causes a paidful burning sensation if I try to exercise. I have worn a support sock for about 6 months that does not seem to have done any good.Last month I went on vacation and did a tremendous amount of walking/hiking. I am now experiencing a numbness of the outer ankle and a tingling everytime that I move the ankle.My doctor has suggested surgery. I am the child of a family full of diabetes and have lost 3 grandparents to its complications. I am concerned about the healing and scarring issue (I scar very easily).Are there any other options. I would dearly love to begin jogging again or even walking.ThanksSheri",
