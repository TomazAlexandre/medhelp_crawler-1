            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Normally a high blood pressure during pregnancy goes away within a few weeks. However if it persists and you have symptoms of UTI then kidney function should be assessed. Most labs have a panel of tests to diagnose the cause of blood pressure. Diabetes mellitus and diabetes insipidus too should be looked into. Please get the investigations and do seek another opinion if need be.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "HiA nephrologist can definitely help. However investigation for the cause of high blood pressure encompasses a wide range of investigations targeted at different body organs of which kidney is only one part. Hence it would be better if you could get another internist or may be your PCP to help you out. A spike of 200mmHg systolic can indeed be dangerous.Hope this helps. Take care!",

    "question": "About a month before my last baby was born, I developed high blood pressure (never had ANY trouble in the past even in 3 other pgs).\u00a0\u00a0I was induced 2.5w early because of it and ended up back in the ER 9d after the birth with an even higher BP and was diagnosed with a UTI.\u00a0\u00a0Since then I have been off and on labetalol for my BP, have had several spikes in my BP (sometimes nearing 200's), have had yet another UTI, and have switched to Verapamil.\u00a0\u00a0I have had some other odd, sporadic symptoms like my face turning red (1 cheek on 1 morning, the other the next morning, plus my forehead), a headache almost every day to varying degrees for the last 4.5m (from faint to severest migraine ever), & frequent urination to name a few.\u00a0\u00a0Some of my bloodwork was a little \"off\" too when I had my physical.Despite being the 3rd of 4 generations with urinary/kidney issues, my doctor doesn't want to do any more testing.\u00a0\u00a0After talking with people, many agree with me that something else is going on (some are medical professionals other than drs too).\u00a0\u00a0I have researched my problems long and hard and have come up with 2-3 potential diagnoses.\u00a0\u00a0They are somewhat uncommon, so perhaps that's why my dr won't look into or even bring them up to me.\u00a0\u00a0Other than this issue, I really like my dr and don't want to switch; however, I don't know what else to do.\u00a0\u00a0Should I circumvent her altogether and find a specialist?\u00a0\u00a0If so, what kind?\u00a0\u00a0If not, what do I do?\u00a0\u00a0I know the old saying, \"When you hear hoofbeats think horses not zebras,\"\u00a0\u00a0but I feel like I'm seeing the stripes on those zebras right now.",
