            "answer": "I have that, too. I have Hashimoto's thyroid disease, which causes the thyroid to be tender, swollen. I suggest you go to an endocrinologist who specializes in thyroid, not diabetes. Here are the thyroid tests you will need:Bloodwork:TSH, FT4, FT3, TPOab and the TGabPlus a thyroid ultrasound.Post your labs here after you get them. Many labs still use the old standards for TSH (0.5-4.5). I suffered for a long time because doctors said my TSH (2.74) was normal, but many doctors in the know now say anything above a 2.0 is too high.:) Tamra",

            "answer": "along with what Tamra says - do a thyroid neck neck. You can google the directions and find the proper way to preform the procedure.

    "question": "I have had a tender throat to the touch under the Adam's apple region for about two weeks now. I can't even stand to touch it. If I press ion it it almost makes me gag. My throat feels somewhat restricted as well. I have sleep apnea but use a CPAP machine at night. I have also had a nose surgery for turbenectomy (spelling) and something else (forgot) deviated septum I think. Anyway just wondering if I should get this looked at or wait for a week or so. I also get breathless at times due to the anxiety I am sure.",
