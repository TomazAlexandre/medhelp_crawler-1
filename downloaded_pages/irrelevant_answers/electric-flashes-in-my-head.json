            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Electrical current like feeling can be due to side effects of certain medications. So stop this drug and see if it helps. It can also be due to fibromyalgia, can be due Vit D or Vit B12 deficiency or peripheral neuropathy of diabetes and hypothyroidism. A pinched cervical spinal nerve can also be the cause. Lyme\u2019s disease is another possibility.I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind. Take care!",
