            "answer": "HiThanks for the post.Numbness is generally due to damage or pressure of nerves. It is accompanied by tingling and pin pricks sensation. In your case since it stared in back, the damage or pressure is probably on a spinal nerve that supplies the leg including the great toe. Numbness of the great toe is due to several causes like Lumbar spondylitis, diabetic neuropathy, peripheral neuropathy, degenerative changes or tubercular involvement or mineral deposition etc on your vertebra; thus putting pressure on your spinal nerve. Multiple sclerosis and any cause of nerve injury like a fall should also be looked into.However it is difficult to diagnose without examining. You may also need to take some blood tests to rule out diabetes, X-rays or MRI etc to reach a diagnosis. So please consult your doctor. Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Numbness in the big toe is usually due to pinched spinal nerves. These nerves come out of the spinal canal to supply the back and legs. You must further get the back problem evaluated to know whether the nerve is being pinched or not. The nerves can also be pinched at the level of tarsal tunnel at the ankle.Since you have carpal tunnel problem and fibromyalgia also get your thyroid, parathyroid, VitD and Vit B12 levels checked.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",
