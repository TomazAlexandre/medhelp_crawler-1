    "question": "I have stage 4 kidney failure. I'm confused about why I have it and if I am on the right meds. I have DM type 2 and I have cysts in my kidneys. Does this mean I have Polycystic kidney disease, or does it just mean I have benign cysts? I take Lisinopril 5 mg daily. My doctors say that the kidneys don't hurt, but I have constant pain.
