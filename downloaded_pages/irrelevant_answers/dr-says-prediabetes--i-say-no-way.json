            "answer": "Numbness and pain in the legs and feet can sometimes be referred pain from the problems in your lower back.Numbness and pins and needle sensations can also be due to nerve damage.\u00a0\u00a0This can happen way before any signs of pre diabetes is picked up.Your finger prick test is not the same as the HbA1C blood test.\u00a0\u00a0When you do a prick test that will only show your sugar levels at the time that you draw your blood to check it on the strip.The HbA1C blood test gives you the average glucose levels in your blood over a period of 9-12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0The reason for this is that glucose sticks to the platelets that are renewed every 9-12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0This gives a more accurate picture of what has been going on over that period.In the UK a level of 6.9 is classed as Type 2 diabetes.If you are unhappy about being put on medication right now, ask the doctor to do another HbA1C blood test in a few months from now, or send you for a glucose fasting test.If you have been experiencing any inner thigh skin problems or getting boils, any wounds not healing very fast, then it may be a good wise for you to follow your doctor's advice.To get your sugar levels lower and the high bad cholesterol levels, you will need to cut out all sugary, processed and junk foods, as well as fruit juices and other fizzy and sugary drinks.\u00a0\u00a0Eat a health and well balanced diet with fresh fruit and veg that contain minerals, vitamins and fibre.\u00a0\u00a0Going for at least 2 walks a day or doing any other type of exercise to help you get fitter and lose weight, will also help to bring down the high bad cholesterol as well as control your sugar levels better.My husband goes for a 20 minute walk twice a day as well as eating more healthily and his high bad cholesterol has come down to a good level.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately, his sugar levels were extremely high when he was diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes and metformin and other tablets were not working for him.\u00a0\u00a0He takes tables as well as insulin and is now doing fine.I didn't have glucose intolerance, but my nerves were damaged.\u00a0\u00a0I was constantly getting skin infections even my glucose HbA1C levels were no more than 6.3.Do bear in mind that being overweight and having even slightly elevated sugar levels than what is considered normal, as well as your high bad cholesterol levels, puts your health at risk when having any surgery.",

            "answer": "You are testing your Fasting BG.\u00a0\u00a0The fasting BG is the verry last thing that goes bad.\u00a0\u00a0try testing your BG 1 hour after the biggest carbohydrate meal of the day.Also the A1c is not always accurate, anemia and having red Blood cells that live longer than most can skew the results.Best test\u00a0\u00a0is a OGGT\u00a0\u00a0 Oral Glucose Tolerance Test\u00a0\u00a0If done rite (check BG every 20 minutes for 2 to 3 hours)\u00a0\u00a0will tell you a LOT about how your body handles carbs.",

            "answer": "Hba1c of 6 means your average blood sugar is about 130.\u00a0\u00a0Considering that a non-diabetic hba1c is < 5, I agree with your NP that you are prediabetic and probably well on the way to becoming overtly diabetic.You can ignore this and let complication start or you can do something about it.The best way to address diabetes is by weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0Considering you say you are big enough to be a candidate for weight loss surgery, then weight loss may well reverse your condition.The best way to lose weight is by following a low carb diet (avoiding breads, pasta, rice, sweets, etc and instead eating plenty of veges - not fruits, as they are sweet).\u00a0\u00a0Exercise as much as you can, but ideally a minimum of 30 minutes continuous activity every day.\u00a0\u00a0High triglycerides are also often a sign of a high carb diet and should go down if you can cut your carbs.If I were you, I'd take the Glucophage (make sure you take a b-vitamin as well), which is often a very helpful medication and work on reducing weight - naturally if possible.",

            "answer": "Joyce,The back pain,leg pain are a separate issue. You are not diabetic per se and the term is insulin resistant not pre diabetic-and you are that. You CAN get blood sugar down with weight loss and supplements (always get pharma grade not OTC-look for GMP sticker) with alpha lipoic acid and chromium\u00a0\u00a0nicotinate which happens to also suppress\u00a0\u00a0appetite and more if needed but metformin is not necessary-you are right-get the blood\u00a0\u00a0sugar down and then \"show her\"!",

            "answer": "Having a bulging disc, degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis can cause problems in the leg - pins and needles, numbness as well as back pain.If you have not have a referral to a physiotherapist for specific exercises and a referral for hydrotherapy, do look into this.\u00a0\u00a0This may help you.As you mention that you are very overweight (by saying that you would be a candidate for a stomach operation), losing some weight will take off the stress of your back and that of your legs, as well helping to lower your sugar levels.If you do experience any soreness on your inner thighs, is likely to be a fungal problem and can arise from having a glucose intolerance or insulin resistant.\u00a0\u00a0These are a precursor to diabetes.If you experience skin soreness, wounds that do not heal quickly and lots of spots and boils, going on to Metformin a slow release low dose will help.Even with weight loss surgery, you will still have to work hard by avoiding certain foods to not put weight back on.\u00a0\u00a0There are also complications that can happen with this procedure so it is not something that you should go into lightly.\u00a0\u00a0You won't be able to have high fat and simple carbohydrate foods, like cakes, chocolates, biscuits.\u00a0\u00a0You will still need to be careful what you eat and calorie count.If you have not tried slimming groups, you try those first to give you support and encouragement.",

    "question": "I went to doctor to be referred to a specialist to find out why my legs go numb and why my back hurts all the time. Have had many many tests in the last 6-8 months and they have found a bulging disc and degenerative disc disease, and spinal stenosis. Anyhow the NP decided to do a complete blood workup. It came back and my A1C was 6... a year ago it was 5.5. She wants to put me on metformin right away and i refuse. I have done finger sticks almost daily for the last couple of weeks and my morning sugar (usually after coffee w/creamer) is between 86-98. I just do not see how after ONE report coming back high they would want to stuff me full of medication. I would say monitor sugar, and retest. Is this the right thing or should i start putting prescription meds into my body that i may not need.Also my triglycerides were a little high, LDC was a little low. And Vitamin D was low. I am overweight, and have been trying to get a referral for weight loss surgery. This NP said that if i don't take the medication then she will make sure that i do not get approved for the surgery. WTF?",
