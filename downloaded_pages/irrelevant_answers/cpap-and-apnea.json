            "answer": "Hello, Poodlelover.I'm sorry to read that the CPAP treatment is not helping you.\u00a0\u00a0There are a couple of possilbilities.\u00a0\u00a0First, your mask may be leaking during the night and you're not getting the required oxygen.\u00a0\u00a0Second, you may not be getting the good deep sleep because of the noise of the machine and you're also getting adjusted to the CPAP.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, and this happened to me, your pressure may be incorrect.\u00a0\u00a0When you have a sleep study, it's done in an unfamiliar place and only for one night.\u00a0\u00a0Your pressure needs may be different at home on a comfortable bed.Did your CPAP machine come with a smart card that tracks your sleep data?\u00a0\u00a0If so, you can bring the card to the sleep doctor or to your home care provider and they can read the data. This may show that you need a different pressure or even another sleep study.\u00a0\u00a0I brought the card in and they were astonished at how many apneas I was still having.\u00a0\u00a0This leg to another sleep study and an increase in pressure.\u00a0\u00a0I still didn't feel better so they gave me a different machine - a BiPAP.Some people have \"Complex\" sleep apnea.\u00a0\u00a0This is when you are being treated for obstructive sleep apnea and the machine causes you to develop central sleep apnea.\u00a0\u00a0there is also a mchine to help wih that.I would definately talk to either your sleep doctor or home care provider and try to get another sleep study if you do not have a sjart card.Best of luck!Curt",

            "answer": "Thanks for the info.\u00a0\u00a0I have no idea what central sleep apnea may be but will google it.No, no smart card...I think I may look into the type of mask? that just goes up the nose only.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to talk to the doctor about that.Again, thanks.Jeannie",

            "answer": "Curt is right. If you are using a nasal pillows mask, what are you doing to assure that your mouth does not open and let your therapy out? It is always a good idea to have you own copy of your sleep study. May hold some clues.Also, have you been checked for any other causes of feeling bad... thyroid, diabetes, anemia? Or other sleep disorders such as limb movements?You should be able to ask you doctor to order you a 2 week trial on a machine called an autopap. It will find your needed pressure to confirm that what you were titrated at is therapeutic. Also, your doc could order an overnight oximetry to be done at home. Just clip it on your finger and it will record any fluctuations that may indicate you are still having apneas.",

    "question": "I do not understand why someone would still be having symptoms when using the CPAP machine.\u00a0\u00a0Isn't that supposed to cure the problem.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that the breathing gets worse when using the CPAP machine.\u00a0\u00a0I feel like I have been drugged in the morning and it takes 3 to 4 hours to get going.\u00a0\u00a0Prior to the sleep study, I felt great!\u00a0\u00a0Got up in the AM, lots of energy all day, no sleepliness, none of the symptoms that one may have with apena.\u00a0\u00a0I was in the hosp for surgery and my oxy level fell to 83% when sleeping so they tested me for apnea.\u00a0\u00a0Said I had a mild to moderate case.\u00a0\u00a0But the CPAP does not make me feel better.\u00a0\u00a0I was feeling great before...What's wrong?",
