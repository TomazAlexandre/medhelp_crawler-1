            "answer": "Hi there,I had colonoscopy in February this year and I had exactly the same symptoms for 3 days after that but doctor should have given you some medicine to restore bacteria flora in your colon and stomach as well as medicine to reduce constipation. I didn't even eat properly for those 3 days and went to bathroom 2 times only(for a week my diet was no hard foods,no sugar only milk products,soup,salad, yogurt,fruits the things that digest easily) . The side effects of colonoscopy where still following me for 2-3 month as I lost about 6kgs(no persistent pain but there were some spasm here and there) and I only started to recovering from it recently(in June).Please visit physician asap for appropriate medicine. I would suggest to buy some probiotics in mean while and take one in morning and one before sleep. Try to eat a lot of yogurts and milk products. The spasm are due to bacterial overgrowth and constipationHere is what doctors give after colonoscopy procedure : 1. course of probiotics(to restore flora of the stomach,for one week 1 pill in morning and one at evening)2. some vitamins or granules that contain different vegetables that will reduce constipation(please note must not be pills) 3. drink 3 liters of water every day(to clean colon and reduce chances of constipation)If you were diagnosed with IBS you can carry on taking probiotics but reduce it to one capsule a day,",

            "answer": "You are welcome.Eat yogurt it contains probiotic that helps to digest lactose properly(before you buy yogurt read on it what it contains it usually says what probiotics it contains and how it helps your stomach). By the way the best fruit to eat with lactose intolerance is grapefruit preferably with the white skin) or drink 100% grape juice.I eat grapefruit every day as it helps with digestion.I try to stay away from pills , as each and every pill makes an effect on your body it might help with something but in same time it has the side effect too.I was doing research on IBS and found a list of products that are the best to take so I started to try it in different ways and it seems I found the perfect way to eat it(I even can eat fast foods now and my stomach don't get irritated). Here is suggestion for lactose intolerance control: download the following top 10 fruits with diabetes and top 10 vegetables to eat with diabetes. Basically lactose intolerance comes from your liver/gallblader/pancreas working inpoperly and not digesting food . it is possible to control by following strict diet but it might take\u00a0\u00a01-2 years before you might come back to your normal live. Fitness is essential with lactose intolerance and be positive in life (try not to stress ,find hobby that will keep your mind occupied, IBS is a illness in your head at first). Hope you will get better soon.",

    "question": "I had a colonoscopy more than a month ago. Since\u00a0\u00a0then\u00a0\u00a0I am spending every morning in a bathroom with cramps, spasms and severe pain for 2, 3, sometimes 4 hours. At first I was so spasmed I could not even pass the gas.Now I have several very small stools, hard and narrow. Sometimes it brings a relief. Sometimes a relief\u00a0\u00a0comes after a pretty bad spasm. If I have more fiber in my diet, the next morning I have even more pain. My GI confirmed the diagnosis that I have IBS, twisty bowels. One small polyp was removed. Does anyone have the same experience? Or maybe knows how to regulate the bowel movement and calm down the bowel? I am desperate. I have a small baby to take care of .",
