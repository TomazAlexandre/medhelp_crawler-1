            "answer": "Hi,Most people normally shed 50 to 100 hairs a day and this amount of hair loss should not cause noticeable thinning of the scalp hair. Hair thinning and loss could be due to increased rate of shedding compared to the rate of regrowth. This could be due to: hormonal changes, poor nutrition, diseases, certain medications, infections and stress.In particular, telogen effluvium, is a type of hair loss that is usually due to severe stress such as a result of trauma, childbirth, puberty, major surgery, and severe chronic illness causes large numbers of hairs to stop their growing phase and shift into a resting phase. After three months, the resting hairs suddenly start falling out. This type of hair loss is not always a permanent condition and hair eventually grows back within six to nine months. This condition is usually self correcting and if stress levels are controlled, hair can return to natural growth cycles.You can read more about this through this link: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telogen_effluvium)The over-the-counter medication minoxidil promotes new hair growth and prevents further hair loss in a small percentage of people. However, if your condition persists, it would be best to see your doctor for further evaluation and management. Take care and keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Hi,Hair loss in your case might be a result of change in hormones or family history of baldness.There are medical conditions that can cause it , such as high fever, diabetes, thyroid disorders lupus, and recent surgery. These will have to be ruled out by blood tests.Dietary insufficiencies like reduced intake of protein and iron in your diet, chemicals used for dying, bleaching, straightening or hairstyling that pull your hair tight are also the reasons of hair loss on the scalp.Consuming foods rich in proteins such as meat, egg, cheese and nuts, milk and supplements of vitamins B, C, E may reduce the loss.Medications like Propecia (Finasteride) and Minoxidil (Rogaine) are available to treat this condition but the effectiveness of these rugs is not well established.ref:http://living.oneindia.in/men/for-him/hair-loss-in-men.html",
