    "question": "Hello. When I shower, I sometimes get soap on the top of my penis; Then when I use the toilet, it hurts like hell. I know this may sound a little weird to most of you but it is happening to me. And it usually takes about a week in a half for it to heal for the pain to go away. I'm kind of a fast healer. But I'm still wondering if theres a faster way of treating it.",
