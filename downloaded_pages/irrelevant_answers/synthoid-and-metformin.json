            "answer": "How long have you been treated for Hashi?\u00a0\u00a0Did the PCOS and high triglycerides occur around the time you were diagnosed with Hashi?\u00a0\u00a0The reason I ask is that I developed ovarian cysts and high triglycerides the same time as my hypothyroid symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0After I was on Synthroid for several months (I'm thinking 6-8 or so), the cysts went away and triglycerides dropped to normal levels.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't receive treatment for either condition.",

            "answer": "Well, I was diagnosed with Hashi in this April. I have been taking Synthoid for about four, five months now. However, my triglycerides level did not drop much. Also, I have high testosterone level. I was give a glucose tolerance test just August 21. My endo said I have insulin resistence. However, my fasting blood sugar is 74 and fasting insulin 7, those are all normal. After I drink the glucose solution, my blood sugar level went up to 178 and insulin level also high and it stay high for more than an hour or so. So I was just diagnosed with PCOS in August. And my endo wants to treat me with Metformin to regulate my mensutral cycle and ovulation. But I wasn't sure if all these meds have their interaction or not.",

            "answer": "Well, for my hypothyroid I did gain a lot weight. My height is about 5'8 and I used to weight about 132 lbs. Since the thyroid problem, my weight has increased 33 lbs to a 165 lbs. No matter how many hours of exercise I do, I can not get it off. I didn't have much symptoms before. I had my symptoms last year after I did a 5k run. Metformin didnot really make much change in me. Sometimes I feel nausea, but I had it before I take metformin. I am tired all the time, but I was that way already before I take metformin. I use to be able to do 5k run, but now even with a 30 minutes walk, I feel very tired. I have to sometimes just push myself to do it. What about you? Do you have fatigue too? How is your energy level? As for my menstrual cycle, I am better than yours. Sometimes I will skip a months or two, other than that its ok. I did lost about 15 lbs since I took synthoid. I weight about 150 lbs now. And I didn't gain any after diagnose with PCOS. I think mainly because of the nausea, I didn't eat much as I use to and I don't eat much sugar and carb anymore. Although, I think with my height, my weight does not consider to be overweight. But I do wish I can go back to my old self. If not the weight, at least the energy level.",

            "answer": "I take synthroid (0.2mg) and Metformen ER 500 mg.\u00a0\u00a0I have been juggling these meds (and many more) for years.\u00a0\u00a0I also have a great endocrinologist (after firing two horrible ones) who helps me with my meds.I take the synthroid just as soon as I wake up with water then try to avoid anything else for at least half an hour.\u00a0\u00a0I take the Metformen in the evening with all my other pills.Don't take vitamins/minerals at the same time as your synthroid - calcium and other minerals can \"bind up\" your synthroid and you won't get your proper dose.\u00a0\u00a0I also am on hormone replacement as I have had my ovaries taken out from chronic hemorrhagic cysts (PCOS).\u00a0\u00a0I ensure my hormones are taken in the evening too.\u00a0\u00a0Many women with PCOS are put on some type of hormone (birth control, etc.) and my MDs have warned it can mess with the thyroid levels too.Just play it safe and give that wonderful little thyroid pill its place of honor",

    "question": "I am taking 75mcg Synthoid every morning for Hashi. Recently, my endo diagnosed me with PCOS after the glucose tolerance test and he prescribed 500mg Metformin for me to take after dinner everyday. I read online that taking Metformin and Synthoid together can actually cause hyperglycermic. Is this true? Do I need special monitoring? Are my dosages ok? Another thing is that my PCP has prescribe me Omacor for my high triglycerides level. Will Omacor interact with those other two meds I am currently taking?",
