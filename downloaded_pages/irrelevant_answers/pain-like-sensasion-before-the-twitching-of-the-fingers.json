            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!There is a chance that you have compression of the spinal nerves in the cervical spine region. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. Use a hard bed to sleep. Avoid a pillow. Roll a towel and place it under your neck while sleeping. Initially this will be uncomfortable but with time the acupressure will do wonders. Use an analgesic cream or spray. Anti-inflammatory drugs help. A good physiotherapist can teach you some exercises which will help you a lot. A MRI of the cervical spine may be required. Please consult a neurologist.It is possible to feel tremors all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism etc. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I've been getting this pain like sensation before the tremors in the fingers began, both hands at different intervals and its been happening for two weeks now. It usally occurs whenever I bend over to pick up an item of some sort. Its steadly been getting worse with not only the tremors in the fingers, but now from the shoulders to the forearm both sides also, but in shorter intervals. It feels like I'm shivering from the cold, but its not the case at all. Its not made obvious to any one. So I'm thinking it could be the nerves? I've also been having neuropathic like headaches. One time I had an ear-ache and that sensation travelled to the side of the head with a serve of pain on one half of my face and around the eyes.I've not been getting any other symptom's like blured vision speech problems.I went to see the gp about the tremors in the fingers and he refured me to a neurologist, and it looks like I'm on a waiting list for an appoinment time to become available or something. I'm going to vist the gp again this Monday to ask for an XRAY or an MRI scan, and I'm gonna bagger him until I get what I want. Its not normal for someone my age (24 years of age) to be getting these symptom's.I'm really really hoping its not what I think it is. So heres one other theories I've been playing around with to calm my nerves lol.Could diabetes be the cause of it? I haven't gone and gotten myself tested, just avoiding the issue really.:-(I really should add that I've been prescribed nasal injection sprays nearly two months back to tackle the sinusitis problem. Thats about all the meds (and non other) I've had till around about the end of August.",
