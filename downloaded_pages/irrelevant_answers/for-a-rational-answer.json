I've had poison ivy --- so I can totally understand... LMAO!And to simonbowie... Nah... Not anymore than you would turn into a Martian if the person in front of you was from Mars.Chances are 99.9999999999999999% that you would not contract HCV from a piece of paper or anything like that.You need to have an actively bleeding opening in your skin --- and you need to have their blood getting into your blood.It's a blood borne disease.So don't panic ---- BUT --- on a side note --- FOR EVERY HUMAN BEING --- I advocate a HEP PANEL test every 2 years to 5 years.Not because we should all be afraid --- but like diabetes --- HCV or HepB or HepA can happen to ANYONE.Meki",

Just for personal knowledge as I work in public sector(Employment Section) and I see alot of IVDUs. Today a client HEP C positive came to my office. We just passed papers and talked for a few minutes cause as soon as I knew that he was HEP C I freaked out being a Hypochondriac maniac. Was I ever in risk?ThanksS",
