    "question": "I have Gestational Diabetes and that puts the baby in risk of becoming too big. I get sonograms each week to ensure that my baby is not growin g to big. I haf an ultrasound yesterday and the baby is weighing 5lbs 15oz. I'm 35 weeks. Is this too much?? I'm really scared of having too big of a baby because of complications that she may have or complications at birth.The evening primrose oil is supposed to ripen ur cervix and make it softer. I know it doesn't make u go into labor. But if the baby does become to big is this something I should look into to make the labor process shorter and easier due to a big baby? Or??? I know I'm too early right now to go into labor and baby is still too small to be born. But should I start the primrose oil now or what? I do plan on bringing this up with my ob because I know if the baby becomes too big I can be medically induced and I do not want that. I would like to bring labor on naturally. And I would also like to go the complete 40 weeks. But I know babies grow a lot more in the end..Thank you for ur responses and opinions. I welcome any comment as I know that this may be an iffy subject to post about.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to see my options and see how people feel about this.",
