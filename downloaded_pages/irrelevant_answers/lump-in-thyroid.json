            "answer": "Dear Friends,I have very much enjoyed my time on Medhelp and have learned from you even while hosting our Ask-A-Doctor forum for Diabetes. Sadly I am leaving the Medhelp community as my own practice has become busier and time constraints have proved quite challenging. So from April 7th 2008 I will be officially away from Medhelp, but you can still find me at our practice website www.endocrinehelp.com, so please drop me a\u00a0\u00a0line if you wish. Most likely a new physician will be hosting the Diabetes forum for Medhelp in the future, so please continue to check in with the Medhelp community.All the best to you and blessings for the future,Sincerely,Anita Ramsetty,MD",

    "question": "Please could you help doctor, you have provided great advice in the past. I have recently been checked for Diabetes, Pheochromocytoma and Addison's and all results are normal. I have also had thyroid tests and my TSH was 4.6 six weeks ago, which I was told was borderline high for hypothyroid. But this week my TSH has dropped to 1.4 and I have also developed a small lump the size of a pea in my thyroid gland. My doctor here in the UK has not helped much and that is why I am asking your advice. He thinks this lump is unlikely to be a nodule but is probably a lump made from thyroid tissue as it is moveable. I want to ask if this could still cause problems with how the thyroid works by making it either hyper or hypothyroid and could it give symptoms. I also want to ask why my TSH could go from borderline high to lower in such a short time. Is this normal or could it be to do with the lump? Also I wish to know if thyroid anti-bodies can cause symptoms even if a person has a normal TSH? I would be so grateful for your help again. Thank you.",
