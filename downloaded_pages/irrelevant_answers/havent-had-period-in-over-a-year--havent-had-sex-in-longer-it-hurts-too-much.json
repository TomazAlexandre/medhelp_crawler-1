            "answer": "Hi there!Aside pregnancy, lack of periods or secondary amenorrhea could occur due to stress, recent weight change, hormonal imbalance, PCOD, anemia, infections, systemic abnormalities, thyroid imbalances, medication side effect etc. If the periods are delayed by more than 2-3 months, she would need to be seen by a gynaecologist for a detailed valuation to consider the possibilities. After a cause is identified it can be managed accordingly.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
