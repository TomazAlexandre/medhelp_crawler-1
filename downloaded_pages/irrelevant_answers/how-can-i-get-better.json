            "answer": "Anxiety and depression feed off each other in a vicious circle so worrying or being depressed about the disease can increase any or those issues that you had before. There is a difference between clinical depression and just feeling unhappy though, so it is important to figure what your problem is/was although sometimes the whole circle gets so confusing you can't even tell by yourself..Have you tried therapy to get to the root issues in order to figure if there are ways to feel different?",

            "answer": "It sounds like you either had post-partum depression, which is a sexual hormone problem, or you got the diabetes while you were pregnant, or maybe even both.\u00a0\u00a0You didn't say what type of diabetes insipidus you have -- there are 4 types.\u00a0\u00a0Pregnancy can cause one type.\u00a0\u00a0Mental illness can cause another type.\u00a0\u00a0Medication can cause it.\u00a0\u00a0Depends on the type.\u00a0\u00a0If this disease, or a hormonal imbalance, caused your depression and/or anxiety, drugs for chronic anxiety or depression won't necessarily cure it.\u00a0\u00a0Also, all three drugs you were on are \"downers,\" meaning they force the body to be sedated, which can increase or cause depression.\u00a0\u00a0Gaining a lot of weight doesn't help, and you don't say what you eat, whether you're getting your electrolytes or not as they're a factor in your illness.\u00a0\u00a0In other words, working on your physiological problems might cure or greatly improve your mood since they can be a factor in it.",
