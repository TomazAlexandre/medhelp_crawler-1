My first i didnt know what was going on really..second i knew how it went just went fice hours 20 mins pushing and my first was 17 hours 44 mins pushing.\u00a0\u00a0Im on baby number three im sure ill be induced again as i dont seem to dialate natural.. I dont have any issues i think worst part about induction is having them break your water for you and then the epidural being put in if you choose that other wise i have had pretty decent inductions my first was 7.5 pounds my second 9.1 pounds no problems with ethr no stitches. Trust the dr to do her jpb as she or he does it daily :)",
