            "answer": "Hi Huggles,I am also a 43 year type 1, since 13. Yes, we are not totally alone. The trigger finger, also known as stenosing tenosynovitis, is common to those of Scandinavian decent, as is type 1 diabetes. My mother was Swedish, and I have both diseases. I would not consider it to necessarily be diabetes related, but certainly genetic.I have had two fingers treated successfully by having the tendon sheath opened to relieve pressure. I have a friend, also over 40 years type 1, who has had the same treatment, but had a lot of trouble with swelling. I believe the difference is the skill of the hand surgeon. Mine, in North Carolina, is extremely skilled. Do your research and get recommendations, as we must for all of our physicians, for most of them know little about us or our problems. The result of not getting further treatment could be your fingers curling up to where your hands can no longer grasp anything.Your endo is an idiot and incompetent in managing diabetes. A \"diabetes practitioner\" should recognize gastroparesis is part of diabetes (I have this as well) and help you treat it with diet modification and possibly medication. This is a classis diabetes complication and should, like all the rest, be managed through a diabetic",

            "answer": "Hi Huggles,Take care with the cortisone. It will really knock your BG control out of whack! My friend's swelling has gone down, but the result on that finger is still not what she expected. I beleive she has had others done without the same problem, but I do not know if she used the same surgeon each time.Larry",

            "answer": "Hi Huggles & Larry,I was just doing some web browsing on trigger finger and came across your discussion.I, like you two, have had type 1 diabetes for some time.\u00a0\u00a0Mine is nearing 44 years at the age of 12.\u00a0\u00a0I also have arthritis, fibromyalgia & hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I just recently started experiencing trigger fingers (both hands) within the past few weeks.My biggest problems seems to be with my right thumb - it is rather painful and this one just started within the past week.I was just recently laid off (after 18 years) and after taking off several months for a much needed vacation, I've just started looking for a new job.\u00a0\u00a0I just went for a job interview a few days ago (which I think was very positive) when this thumb problem reared its ugly head.\u00a0\u00a0I'll be making an appt. with my primary care doctor tomorrow - hopefully I can get an appt. in a few days.This is freaking me out.\u00a0\u00a0I do need to get back in to the work force within the next 2 months and I sure don't need any medical problems now.I did notice when I was browsing that diabetes, arthritis & hypothroidism & female do seem to make a person more prone to having trigger finger.http://www.diabetessymptom.net/news/news_item.cfm?NewsID=337Hopefully I can get some sort of relief.\u00a0\u00a0I hope I don't need surgery ... but that sounds like the end result for most folks.lelly",

            "answer": "I don't have diabetes but I am hypothyroid, have a little arthritis in a couple of fingers and recently got a trigger thumb. I'm a 64 year old female. This is the only forum where I could find trigger finger.I did go to my wonderful chiropractor and he said it is a bone spur that is a type of arthritis. I had 2 massages this week and he adjusted my neck. All the blood for the arm comes from the neck. By cutting the tendon you are not going to get rid of the bone spur it will just keep the tendon from rubbing on it anymore.One book says it might be caused by eating too much sugar or an acidic condition. I take 2 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar with honey every day. that is supposed to neutrialize that acidity.How does a cortizone shot help? or does it? I would appreciate any suggestions. Thanks in advance. I'm new to this forum. I don't take tylenol or asprin due to hepatitis C. I can take a little.",

    "question": "I have been diabetic for 43 years (since I was 13) and feel blessed to not have had many complications.\u00a0\u00a0I have had some trigger fingers in the past and have had them repaired surgically by a surgeon who has since retired.\u00a0\u00a0And other than email, I no longer do much typing but I was a transcriptionist years back.About three months ago, I had a finger \"repaired\" but it really is not working well and several other fingers on both hands are now \"triggering\" as well!\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure if this is a part of diabetes or if othere have had the same thing happen.\u00a0\u00a0Both hands are very painful and pretty useless at times.\u00a0\u00a0I am afraid to have the same doctor do surgery again since the last one ended up so badly. (He's supposed to be the best in the area!)Any words of wisdom out there? Is diabetes the culprit causing so many to act up at once? Is there an alternative to surgery? (I have been doing the PT advised post surgery but that is causing more pain now, too.)Any suggestions will be appreciated!",
