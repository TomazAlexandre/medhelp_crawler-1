            "answer": "Sorry to comment without beeing a specialist but because most of the time the answer will be come delayed, I think an advice is helpful.I strongly advice you to get a second opinion, because these symptoms could be result from heart or kidney problems. I think the best you can do is buy a pair of support socks, keep your feet elevated (above the heart level) as much as you can, avoid standing for long periods or walking extendly or bath in hot water.I wish you the best of luck",

    "question": "My left foot swelling constantly when i walk around on it. When I lie down the swelling goes down but as soon as I get up and walk around a while the swelling returns. It does this on a daily basis. What do you think could be the cause of this. I've gone to the doctor and he stated that it has nothing to do with my heart which was my major concern. Should I get a second opinion?",
