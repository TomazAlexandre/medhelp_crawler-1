            "answer": "what is his blood pressure? anything below 90/60 is considered low. I have low blood pressure when i was preganant it was 90/58 but because i have no dizziness the doctor said im fine and we will treat it if it effects me at all. Severe anaemia can lead to heart failure, my younger sister was born with vsd, hole in the heart and leaky valve and this needed to be operated on or she would die of heart failure not long after, if you are not happy with your doctor who doesnt seem to be helping i would find another, to get your husband sorted, is he being treated for the heart failure? he should be, if not go to another doctor because this needs sorting and it can be treated that maybe why his bp i so low. i hope he gets better and let me know how he is plz",

            "answer": "My mother spent her entire life fighting high BP, then she was diagnosed with Hodgkins disease(cancer of the lymph nodes).\u00a0\u00a0She went through surgery, then chemo and the chemo is what took her life.\u00a0\u00a0It caused chemical diabetes to begin with, and then about 6 months later, it caused lukemia, which eventually took her life.\u00a0\u00a0However, after the surgery and the chemo, high BP was no longer a problem for her, but now it was low BP, and total lack of strength.She was an awesome lady, never letting her health get her down....at least not until she no longer had the strength to get dressed in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0I sure miss her.In any event, if you feel like your husband isn't getting the care he needs, then DO look for another doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He has the right to life, just the same as everyone else.",
