    "question": "Hi!I'm Peekawho, CL of the Dieting Community, and the Healthy Cooking Community.\u00a0\u00a0I'm popping in to invite any of you to come over and make yourselves at home, have a cup of coffee, read, and contribute if you can.\u00a0\u00a0I've personally lost 45 pounds over 6-7 months with simple changes to\u00a0\u00a0my diet, and with sensible exercise.\u00a0\u00a0It can be done without pills, and without severely depriving yourself.\u00a0\u00a0I've been able to cut my BP meds in half after losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0 My husband was able to completely stop his diabetes meds, and his BP meds after losing 65 pounds.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, this\u00a0\u00a0may not happen in your particular situations, but if it could, wouldn't it be fantastic?\u00a0\u00a0 Simple changes that you can keep up in the long run are what will keep you healthy for a lifetime.What we eat can have a major impact on many different health conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 Good, healthy food does not have to be boring and bland!\u00a0\u00a0Food should be nourishing, delicious, and fun to experiment with.\u00a0\u00a0I make better choices now, but still allow myself some treats when I feel I really want them.I'd love for any of you to come and look around the Dieting Community, and the Healthy Cooking Community.\u00a0\u00a0Please feel free to join the community and contribute often.\u00a0\u00a0Others might be able to learn from your experiences, and we're always in need of great tasting, healthy recipes, nutrition, and exercise tips!I'll look forward to seeing you soon.Thanks,Peekawho",
