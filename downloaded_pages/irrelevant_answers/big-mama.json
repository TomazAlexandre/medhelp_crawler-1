            "answer": "Usually the measurement is close to the same as weeks you are. So 27-28 weeks normally is between 25-30 cm. Your dr is most likely doing a growth scan to make sure the dates are looking good. You are basically measuring 3-5 weeks ahead. I wouldn't worry too much all babies grow different and belly measurements are not 100%!",

            "answer": "Just to prove what C_bay said, I just got an extra scan because I was measuring small and my baby is absolutely fine. Though for babies measuring big they may be concerned about gestational diabetes. Have you been tested for that yet?",
