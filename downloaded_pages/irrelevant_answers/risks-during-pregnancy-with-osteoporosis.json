            "answer": "Sounds like you have good, active medical care so you're already ahead of the game! But do get the BMD done soon, so that it can also be done again on a later date as a follow up, after you have your baby - to see how you managed the additional stress.Giving that your body already needs additional vitamins and minerals due to your osteo issues, your baby will place an extra load on your system. The baby's requirements will probably consume about 10% to 15% of what you take in. But I'd discuss this with your doctors first and not just start taking a bunch of extra vitamins, calcium, etc.Hope things go well with your little one.",

Although this important mineral is important throughout your lifetime, your body\u2019s demand for calcium is greater during pregnancy and breastfeeding because both you and your baby need it. The National Academy of Sciences recommends that women who are pregnant or breastfeeding consume 1,000 mg (milligrams) of calcium each day. For pregnant teens, the recommended intake is even higher: 1,300 mg of calcium a day.Good sources of calcium include:low-fat dairy products, such as milk, yogurt, cheese, and ice creamdark green, leafy vegetables, such as broccoli, collard greens, and bok choycanned sardines and salmon with bonestofu, almonds, and corn tortillasfoods fortified with calcium, such as orange juice, cereals, and breads.In addition, your doctor probably will prescribe a vitamin and mineral supplement to take during pregnancy and breastfeeding to ensure that you get enough of this important mineral.Exercise. Like muscles, bones respond to exercise by becoming stronger. Regular exercise, especially weight-bearing exercise that forces you to work against gravity, helps build and maintain strong bones. Examples of weight-bearing exercise include walking, climbing stairs, dancing, and weight training. Exercising during pregnancy can benefit your health in other ways, too. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, being active during pregnancy can:help reduce backaches, constipation, bloating, and swellinghelp prevent or treat gestational diabetes (a type of diabetes that starts during pregnancy)increase energyimprove moodimprove posturepromote muscle tone, strength, and endurancehelp you sleep betterhelp you get back in shape after your baby is born.",

    "question": "At my annual followup with my sleep specialist in November, I noted concern that I've shrunk 3\" and asked if it was probable that the cause was due to disc degeneration.\u00a0\u00a0Three years ago, at age 32, a neurologist told me I had the level of degeneration he would anticipate seeing in someone in their 70's.\u00a0\u00a0The sleep specialist said, instead, it sounded like I I had some advanced degree of osteoporosis and needed to follow up with having the bone density test and find out treatment options.I haven't done that and found out on the 15th of this month that I am pregnant.\u00a0\u00a0Today I called to make my first appointment with an OB/GYN and gave the above information to the receptionist who explained I'd be referred to a high risk OB to provide the remainder of my prenatal care when I go in for my initial visit.What kind of risks am I potentially facing during this pregnancy and what special care/treatment might I be looking at?",
