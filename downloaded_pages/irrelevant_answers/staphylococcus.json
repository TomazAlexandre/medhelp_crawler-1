            "answer": "Hi,The staphylococci are usually found in the skin, so it is moot to try and find where you actually got it. If your daughter is in good health, she would likely not have any problems with holding your hand or a hug,\u00a0\u00a0though of course, washing your hands is really the best way to prevent infections.Coag negative staphylococci should be handled with antibiotics. Of course, any misuse of antibiotics may promote resistance.What is more important is that, men don't usually get urinary tract infections and maybe you need to find out why you got it. Best discuss this with your doctor, among the things to consider would be a systemic disease like diabetes, some obstruction due to a subclinical prostatic enlargement.",

            "answer": "Hi Doc,Thanks. I went back to the Uroligist and he did a prostate exam. He found nothing wrong. My WBC count was normal. Does this mean that the infection is passed and the symptoms are probably the after effect of the infection?Is my WBC count affected by the fact that I am on anti biotics?ThanksLost in Asia",

    "question": "Hi,I have been dignosed with coagulase-negative staphylococci. While not an STD, probably obtained through sex. However, there is not much information regarding it. Can you provide any insights into this?1) I have a beautiful 10 month old daughter. Is she at risk in anyway? Do I need to take extra precautions?2) Is it possible I got this from my wife 40 days ago. She's not sick, but does get yeast infections after intercourse?Her gyno gives her some meds and she is fine again? She's my only partner for 8 years?3) MSRA is coag positive. Is there a resitance to Coag Neg Staph? What's the next step?4) What other tests should I do to follow up? At least the lab decided it investigate further in order to identify it.On Friday, the uroligist gave me Cravit 500mg x 3 days.Friday morning (large white discharge)-Some burning, iritated prostate, discomfort in the testiclesSaturday small discharge (clear about the size of a pencil) slight burning, discomfort in the testiclesSunday no discharge, less burning, less discomfort in the testicles (perhaps phantom pains)",
