            "answer": "All diabetics are very different, so what works for your blood sugar may not work for the next person. The best way to know what foods you can eat is to test, test, test. Eat a meal you usually enjoy and then test two hours later. If you are over 140 then you either can no longer eat those foods, or need to cut the portions. If you do a lot of testing for awhile then you will get more familiar with foods and how they affect you.Having said that; what raises blood sugar is carbohydrates, so as a rule (diabetes is all about exceptions to rules!) the more carbs you take in, the higher your blood sugar. High carb foods include pasta, potatoes, rice, cereal, bread and sweets. Some people find they can eat whole grains with less effect than white versions of these foods; some find it makes no difference. Fruit, which we think of as a healthy food is also high in carbs so you need to eat it in moderation as well. So all proteins are good, (meat, fish, cheese), and most\u00a0\u00a0vegetables are low carb. You can to go calorieking.com for a list of the nutrients in all common foods and packages also list carbs.",
