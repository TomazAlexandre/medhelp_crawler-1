Honestly though, after I saw a nutritionist and changed my eating habits I was able to control it with diet alone. It's very scary at first but everything turned out just fine. My son was almost 10 lbs when he was born because of the GD and the fact that my husband was that large at birth. But, my son was born happy and healthy with no issues. My blood sugar went back to normal after as well. Hopefully your 3hr test will be fine but if you do end up having GD you and your baby will be ok. Just listen to the doctors.",
