If not have your pediatrician refer you.\u00a0\u00a01. It important to determine the need for glasses with drops that dilate and relax the focus muscle to make sure the glasses are not too strong\u00a0\u00a02. some of these highly myopic eyes are otherwise normal while others have some additional problems.\u00a0\u00a03. If possible see a pediatric ophthalmologist as there are some new studies just coming out on trying to prevent the progression of myopia.You can use the search feature and archives to read about high myopia and progressive myopia.That is all I can tell you in this type of format.JCH MD",

I am myopic(diopter 2.00 and 2.20.). My vision is worse in my right eye. I do not have diabetes, MS or any desease(as i have been to an ophtalmologist 4 days prior when the symptoms started) who completed a slit lamp exam and a ophtalmoscope. I wear glasses that are not anti glare. I aranged a visit at a very good ophtalmologist in my area. What would be the causes. All these symptoms occured after anxiety attacks.If the ophtalmologist does not find anything where should I go(neurologist). I am seeing a psychiatrist about my anxiety next week on monday.",
