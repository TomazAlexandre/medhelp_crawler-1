            "answer": "Hi,The common causes of frequent urination are diabetes mellitus, diabetes inspidus, stone in the urinary tract & urinary tract infection. These need to be ruled out. Hence, will suggest you to discuss these possibilities with your urologist and seek opinion on the same. The commonest cause of weak erections is stress only and thus your urologist suggested the same. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",

            "answer": "Hi,I am a little surprised that at such a young age your bladder muscles are not strong enough to expel the urine from the bladder. Urodynamic studies can help in assessing the degree of weakness of the bladder wall muscles. Has your urologist given some reason of such weakness of the muscles? Please discuss the option of urodynamic studies with your urologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
