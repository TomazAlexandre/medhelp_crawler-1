            "answer": "Hello,What you are having is dry orgasm. There are many causes for such symptoms. Important ones are psychological like unrealistic sexual expectations which make sex a task rather than a pleasure and negative feelings about non performance, certain conditions like benign prostatic hyperplasia, metabolic causes like diabetes, vascular obstructions or narrowing in the area, disturbance in the nerve supply and sensations, altered hormonal balance, infections, malignancies, etc can cause a delayed orgasm or may lead to failure of ejaculation.At your age psychological causes are the commonest but it is important to rule out the other causes also for which I suggest you to get it evaluated from a urologist.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
