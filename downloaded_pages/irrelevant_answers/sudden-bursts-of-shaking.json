            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!It is possible to feel tremors all over the body. Tremors are often associated with drugs, alcohol, smoking, lack of sleep, stress and fatigue. They can be seen in peripheral neuropathies of diabetes, in hyperthyroidism, parasomnia, multiple sclerosis, TIAs or transient ischemic attacks or mini strokes, hypoglycemia, disorders of calcium metabolism, hyperparathyroidism, anemia etc. Consult an internal medicine specialist or your PCP. Anemia you have and does need treatment. However, other causes too should be evaluated. Discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining. A comprehensive investigation is required keeping all the points in mind.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "A few minutes ago, I was standing in the bathroom, looking in the mirror, when suddenly I burst out all over in shaking! It wasn't constant, just short bursts. All of my muscles tensed up all at once and I shook, a lot like a shudder from cold but more violent. Another symptom was just that. I felt as if I was being hit by gusts of cold air everytime it happened. This went on with shaking bursts every five to ten seconds for about five minutes when it finally died down and subsided. What was it? Should I go to the doctor in the morning? I've never had seizures before. I am anemic and I get light headed sometimes but I've never fainted. I'm not on any medications. If it happens again or if I have more symptoms I will update. Thanks in advance.",
