            "answer": "He thinks if he gets sweaty during he'll give it to me and it will get in me and on me I guess.Next year is my 10 yr mark and I just had two kids back to back. My levo had to be increased for the first time (nonpregnancy). So my endo wants to do the scan one more time she says before we just strictly do ultrasounds. It kinda scared me a little because it was at the same appt I had my year ultrasound. I had papillary cancer at 14 had my entire thyroid removed and had high dose radiation right after and RAI the following year. Then thyrogen shots and blood work the next year. And then the yearly routine ultrasound until now.",

            "answer": "Lol he doesnt think Ill give him an issue. He is worried that the salt from HIS sweat/precum will affect the scan. He has been doing the diet with me but substituting kosher salt for regular salt and other substitutes if needed.He is worried that kissing/sex will give me some of his iodine (from his foods and drinks) and it will cause me to have to redo everything.I figured if we used condoms we really wouldnt have an issue with this. But he refuses to have sex with me because HE doesnt want to introduce iodine to my body that we know I shouldnt currently have.",
