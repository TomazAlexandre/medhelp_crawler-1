            "answer": "Hello,Pregnancy chances are nil in your case because ultrasound is the most specific pregnancy test and it has not shown any pregnancy in your case. Frequent urination can be due to many reasons which can be physiological or disease-related, and include excessive intake of liquids, diuretic substances (including tea, caffeine, alcohol, certain drugs), anxiety, exposure to cold, diabetes mellitus, diabetes insipidus (central or nephrogenic), urinary tract infections or obstruction, etc to name a few more common ones.I hope it helps. It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hi all this might sound CRAZY. But here's my story. I had sex on Aug 21st took the morning after pill (sorry if I offend anyone). Had a withdrawal bleed a week later. Have had 3 blood tests - all negative. Have had 2 periods on time - but they were shorter than normal lasting only 3 days (normal bleeding) then just really light (not even needing a pad). Had an US last week which I was told showed no evidence of pregnancy and it showed a very thin endometrial lining. Dr said because I just came off my period. Have taken over 50 preg tests - all neg, except for STUPID evap lines.Could I still be pregnant??? The only thing that is making me think Im pregnant is the fact that I need to pee alot. Am I being ridiculous and just driving myself up the wall?? I am not ready to be pregnant at this stage in my life. Please help if anyone has been through anything similair. Or has any advice. Thankyou",
