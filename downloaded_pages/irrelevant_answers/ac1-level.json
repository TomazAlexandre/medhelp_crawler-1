You can learn a lot about it here http://www.diabetes.org/The key to diabetes is control. This means three things:1. Proper nutrition; stay away from sugary foods and bad carbs and sugary liquids.2. Moderate exercise like walking helps lower glucose.3. Maintain proper/normal weight.\"My AC1 level was 6.4. Not sure what that mean. Could you give me any insight on this level and what a normal level would be?\"This will help explain A1c\u00a0\u00a0http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/ency/article/003640.htmA 6.4% means you're just over the maximum range. Following the three steps above and you will bring this figure down. Is your next A1c scheduled in 3 or 6 months?\"They also gave me a monitor to check my levels in the morning. Could you also give me the levels I should be at, at the time.\"Fasting glucose levels should be between 70 and 99 mg/dl. Fasting means no eating or liquids other than water for 8-10 hours. Its unusual for a first time diagnosed diabetic to test only once. Normally its once before breakfast, 2-3 hours after breakfast and repeat for lunch and dinner. You follow this pattern until you understand what foods affect you glucose levels, then its down to once or no testing.\"She gave me a presription called Metforman hcl 500mg. 1x daily. Could this make the sugar go to low?\"Yes, it helps but you still need to watch your nutrition.

There is plenty more information online regarding managing Type 2 diabetes. Some people who were very overweight reversed their diabetes by losing weight and changing habits.
