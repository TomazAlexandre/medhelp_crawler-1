            "answer": "You may have a condition that mimics hypothyroidism eg: PCOS (Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome).There are a number of medical conditions that raise cholesterol including type 2 diabetes, obesity, alcohol, nephrotic syndrome (kidney damage), obstructive jaundice, hypothyroidism, PCOS, Cushing's syndrome.Your current labs may be due to secondary (central) hypothyroidism (pituitary or hypothalamic dysfunction) - normal TSH with a low free T4 and/or free T3.\u00a0\u00a0Your free T4 is borderline low.\u00a0\u00a0You may find you need a combination of T4 and T3 thyroid replacement to relieve hypothyroid symptoms.Potassium may be falsely high (pseudohyperkalemia) due to the incorrect tube being used to draw blood, delayed processing of the blood sample, a needle that is either too small or too large, or rough handling of the specimen that causes the cells to break open.\u00a0\u00a0A repeat test should be done to confirm potassium blood levels are elevated.Causes of high potassium levels (hyperkalemia) includes acute kidney failure, chronic kidney disease, certain drugs, type 1 or type 2 diabetes, rhabdomyolysis (severe muscle damage), tumour lysis syndrome, trauma, burns, Addison's disease, sickle cell disease, lower urinary tract obstruction, potassium supplements, diet high in potassium (rare cause).",

            "answer": "Your FT4 is WAY too low.\u00a0\u00a0For a number of reasons, FT3 and FT4 ranges are very flawed.\u00a0\u00a0Many of us find that FT4 has to be at least midrange to feel well, and yours is on the floor.\u00a0\u00a0Your FT3 is right at midrange, and many find FT3 has to be in the upper half to upper third of range.Your FT3 and FT4 were never raised sufficiently to relieve symptoms when you were on meds.\u00a0\u00a0Your doctor stopped meds increases too early.Have you ever had antibody testing to see if you have Hashi's?\u00a0\u00a0Hashi's is autoimmune and the most prevalent cause of hypo in the developed world.Between your symptoms and your very low FT4 level, I think you'd feel much better on meds (once they were adjusted properly for you, NOT once your levels are in range, anywhere in range).Perhaps you should try to find a more enlightened doctor...",
