            "answer": "Hi Noah,That is a tough one.\u00a0\u00a0First, have you tried zetia for your cholesterol? It is not a statin and does not cause myalgias.\u00a0\u00a0There is a combination pill of zocor (statin) and zetia, but you can take very low does statin with the zetia. It may not cause the myalgias.It is true that cholesterol, smoking and cocaine use all are risk factors for coronary artery disease.\u00a0\u00a0you should talk to a cardiologist and let them decide if they think your chest pain is consistent with blockages in your arteries.\u00a0\u00a0The major questions is does your pain get worse with exercise, improve with rest and go away with nitro.\u00a0\u00a0If this is all true, a cath is probably a good first step.\u00a0\u00a0If it is not all true, the decision is more difficult.\u00a0\u00a0The process all starts with seeing cardiologist first and deciding if any tests are indicated at all.\u00a0\u00a0They symptoms you describe can have other causes and they happen more at rest and improve with exercise, that suggests it is not a cardiac cause.The risk to a left heart cath are very reasonable, less than a 2% risk of major complications in experienced hands.I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for posting.",
