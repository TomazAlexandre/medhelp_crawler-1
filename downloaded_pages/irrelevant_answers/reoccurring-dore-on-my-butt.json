            "answer": "I have had a reaccuring rash and dark discoloration down my whole butt crack for over 2 years now. I have been to 3 doctors and they always tell me to just shower more. I take almost 3 showers a day and I don't use toilet tissue anymore. I use cleaning wipes. It has not gotten any better. I have also been to 2 different OBGYN for an apparent odor I have inside my femine area. Its not a yeast infection or cancer and the doc says its nothing. The dark discoloration is in that area as well as my butt crack. I am tired of wasting money on more doctors. Is there some over the counter medicine I can buy and use to help my situation? My husband is going to leave me if its doesn't get fixed very soon I am so desperate please help me!!!",
