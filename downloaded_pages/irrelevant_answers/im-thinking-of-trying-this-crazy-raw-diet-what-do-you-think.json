            "answer": "Ditto meniere135, cut the carbs. Learn what to eat and what not to eat. Google simple vs complex carbs. Include in your Google search the GI [Glycemic Index] table. Also, are you doing daily physical exercise along with maintaining proper body weight? A little over defeats the purpose.Going from a carnivorous diet to a raw vegan diet is a drastic change. Yeah it's completely safe to do but that's like going from hot showers to bathing in ice. Some can do it most cannot. I do agree that raw vegan is very healthy but it's not an easy diet to follow. Are you prepared to only eat organic vegies that are raw, uncooked and COLD [repeat; raw, uncooked and cold]. Try it and see if you can sustain yourself for a couple of days. Be sure to continue testing your preprandial and postprandial glucose levels.\u00a0\u00a0Post back and let us know how you're doing. Good luck.",
