            "answer": "I don't have diabetes. I eat very healthily...mostly raw vegan and always focus of food for nutrition, increasing specific foods to fit pregnancy requirements for iron, calcium, vitamin d, c and omega 3. I've gained more weight than recommended (3kg) but I think that's because I've found it difficult to get decent exercise during pregnancy due to fatigue. Although I do walk everywhere as I don't own a car.",

            "answer": "Babies size is pretty much determined at conception unless complications occur. My second was nearly a pound heavier than my first and I ate alot healthier and exercised better with him than my first. I also did not have diabetes with him. He was just a bigger baby. Still 8lb6oz was not huge :) and so far number 3 is measuring where he should, I have lost 7 lbs in the past 2 months with a net 'gain' of -7 lbs and have diabetes with him. Also I was about 7 lbs at birth, my husband was 10! My older brother was around 7 and my younger was 10 as well! Every baby is different!",

            "answer": "If you r eating a healthy diet then u r fine. There r other reasons that could cause u to gain more weight. It's when u gain alot of weight cuz of bad eating habits that is bad maybe it's just ur or the daddy's genes or maybe they r just off on the measurements.",

No GD, all slim and healthy.All my hubby's side have had 7 pound babies on average (his mum and sisters, 11 babies in total).So for me, it's seemed to be the mum's genes that determine the size, not so much the dad's, but don't know how it is for others :)",

    "question": "I'm 34 weeks and my boy is measuring about 1-2 weeks ahead. I'm interested in finding out your experiences with baby size and whether it's relative to the mother, the father or just random. All my siblings were 7lb or under. 2 of my sisters have kids who were all also under 7lb. My partner has 2 kids already and both were well over 9lb. I'd rather a smaller baby for an easier delivery!! I'm wondering what the likelihood is of me having a nice little 6.5lb baby compared with a big 9lb one :)",
