            "answer": "You're gonna want to fast 12 hours before the blood test.\u00a0\u00a0So don't eat anything 12 hours before they draw blood.\u00a0\u00a0You need to have both your fasting insulin and fasting glucose (sugar) tested.\u00a0\u00a0Once you have both blood tests you can calculate your HOMA.\u00a0\u00a0Your HOMA will tell you whether you are insulin resistant or not.\u00a0\u00a0The formula is on the website I've provided.IR is a PREDICTOR of SVR.\u00a0\u00a0Being insulin resistant impairs your ability to achieve a sustained response to Chemotherapy drugs peginterferon and ribavirin...HCV slowly damages the mitochondria through a process of oxidative stress. Aerobic exercise helps produce more mitochondria and a high-protein diet boosts the benefit of exercise, which decreases insulin resistance.Metformin is not for everyone...Discuss this with your Dr.\u00a0\u00a0It increases your odds of clearing if you take it before and/or during treatment.http://www.hcvets.com/data/hcv_liver/InsulinResist.htmIR can be the cause of steatosis & fibrosis in genotype 1 patients. Note to self:Most Doctors are not aware of IR or the roll that it plays. They may also not know how to compute HOMA. It may be helpful to print out the info on this website to bring with you.How do you reduce Insulin Resistance & manage blood sugar?1. Take Vitamin K- It is found in brussel sprouts, brocolli, & dark leafy greens.2. High intensity exercise- Lift weights & ride your bike.3. Eat high fiber foods- fortified cereals- Eat flaxseed4. Consume Citrus Peel Extract5. Supplement Alpha Lipoic Acid6. Low glycemic index diet7. Eat Chromium8. Resistance Training9. Yoga10. Use Turemic when you cook11. Deep restorative sleep12.

            "answer": "Fasting blood sugar results should ideally be less than 100; prediabetes occurs between 101 and 124, and frank diabetes greater than 125. These are fasting measurements, and it\u2019s important to note that one or two results are no more accurate diagnosing diabetes than a couple of blood pressure checks are for hypertension.There\u2019s a test called \u2018HOMA-IR\u2019 that is a ratio between fasting insulin and fasting blood sugar; I believe this is the insulin resistance test. Although there have been some rather recent studies that have associated insulin resistance with poor IFN response, it doesn\u2019t preclude success either. I was *very* resistant to insulin throughout HCV therapy, and went on to SVR-land regardless. I don\u2019t think I\u2019d look for this to be a panacea for success is all\u2026You probably don\u2019t need to take any actions to remedy IR unless you believe you have metabolic issues. As a diabetic, I have to eat all carbohydrates carefully; things like sugar, pasta, potatoes, white bread all need to either be avoided or consumed in small portions. If you metabolize carbs efficiently I wouldn\u2019t think you\u2019d have to worry about any of this.Bill",
