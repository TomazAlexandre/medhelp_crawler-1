            "answer": "My son was the first to get an AI (type I diabetes) at the age of 10.\u00a0\u00a0At that time, I was healthy as a horse (not nearly as big, though..lol).\u00a0\u00a0Since then, I've had a sister and a nephew also dx'd with type I diabetes, I have PA and Hashimoto's, my daughter has lupus and my oldest grandson has type I diabetes.As goolarra said, it's important to keep in mind that the AI's run in the family and because my son was already diabetic, he caught it as soon as his own son began showing symptoms and was able to get treatment immediately.Being aware of the various AI diseases and their symptoms is the first line defense for your kids.",

    "question": "I know once our kids grow up and fledge, they manage their own health.\u00a0\u00a0My question is for those of you with kids still in the home or still under your wing.\u00a0\u00a0When you found out you had a thyroid problem, especially if it is autoimmune, did you drag your kids in for testing?\u00a0\u00a0My father and his mother (gma) both had AI illnesses, I have Hashimoto hypothyroidism.\u00a0\u00a0I can't help but wonder if they have hashi or other AI markers.\u00a0\u00a0A part of me wants ask for lab work, then again, we can't go around trying to micromanage something that isn't yet there.\u00a0\u00a0What did you do or if you don't have kids yet, what might you do in your future?\u00a0\u00a0Thank you.",
