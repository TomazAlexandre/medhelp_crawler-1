            "answer": "Hi there!If the fluid appears clear, it is unlikely to be infected and would not require antibiotics. The redness and the swelling of the foot are likely to be due to inflammation and not infection and you may take some OTC NSAIDS for it. The swelling that you describe is probably due to inflammation of the bursa/ bursitis and associated fluid collection. This should get better with time and anti-inflammatory medications and drainage. In case your doctor would like to open the region again, he may charge you for it, though you may like to consider a second opinion as well. Meanwhile it is advised give rest to the foot. Application of ice packs and anti-inflammatory medications may also be beneficial.Hope this helps.Take care!",

            "answer": "First I need to know did you have bunionectomy or a bunionectomy/osteotomy? Second, get a second opinion! If I was attending, I would have you on antibiotics/NSAIDS and would probably put a drain into the wound. Best of luck!",

    "question": "I am 51 and in great health.\u00a0\u00a0In December 2010, I had a bunionectomy.\u00a0\u00a0All went well until about 6 weeks ago.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed unusual swelling.\u00a0\u00a0Shortly after I went to see my Doctor he said that swelling was normal up to a year.\u00a0\u00a0I said that it has never swole up this bad even after the surgery and there seems to be fluid build up.\u00a0\u00a0He took another look and said your right. The last 2 times I saw him he drained fluids and sent them to the lab.\u00a0\u00a0He wanted to see back in a few weeks and if the swelling didn't go down that he would would have to reopen the wound and clean it out. When I asked him aren't you going to put me on antibiotics? He said there was no reason to because it was not infected. But yet my foot is red, inflammed and is still drainig fluids from the hole he poked. I believe I have an infection but he hasn't even tried to put me on antibiotics. If he needs to go back in and clean it out, can he charge me for this procedure since this a complication from the surgery?\u00a0\u00a0Shoud I get a 2nd opinion?",
