            "answer": "HI,A change in activity can certainly affect insulin sensitivity and thus the insulin needs of your body. In addition the needs can change if you previously were making some insulin on your own but now make less/none. We do not get used to an insulin, in a sense of habituation, and need to switch. Many people stay on one type of insulin for a very long time, but the dose tends to change with time.Hope this answers your question, take care.",

    "question": "Hi I was diagnose type 1 diabetic 2006, i inject Novamix 30 twice a day and it has been fine keeping my blood sugar levels constant. Recently i left my very physical job and now my blood sugar levels seem to be uncontrolable, is this because i have left my physical job or is it because my insulin is now ineffective and my body is use to the insulin level. Do you have a limit of the length of time on a type of insulin or should it be changed after a longer period of time.",
