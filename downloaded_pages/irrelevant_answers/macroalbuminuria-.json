            "answer": "Hello,I think it must be microlabuminuria. The common causes of passing proteins in urine are diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney infections, kidney diseases,hypertension,systemic lupus erythematosus etc.I suggest that you should consult your treating doctor and clarify your concerns. Any test result must be correlated clinically. This is merely an advice and not a substitute for clinical examination. Treatment will depend on the underlying cause. Hope it helps.Best wishes and regards!",
