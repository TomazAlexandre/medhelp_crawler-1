            "answer": "Hi JanetI'm sorry to hear you have had trouble getting your diabetes under control. I am relatively recently diagnosed Type 1.5 and on MDI's, but I have heard nothing but positive things from people on pumps, who got their diabetes under control after years of struggling. I suggest you check into two different forums where you will get to meet and chat with many pumpers: TuDiabetes.com and Diabetesforums.com. You will also get much input on diet, weight loss and exercise all of which will help you get stable. Good luck to you.",
