    "question": "It sometimes smells like rotten eggs, stale onions or rotten meat and it comes and goes and the smell is in my nose and mouth and throat. Atleast that's where I thin it's coming from. I have been diagnosed with acid reflux disease and diabetes. The smell is driving me crazy! What is causing it? Any help would be appreciated. I have gone to my personal doctor, ENT and the dentist but none of them seem to know or even how to help me. I have tried fasting and cleansing but it always comes back. What specialist should I refer to? Thanks any help is appreciated.",
