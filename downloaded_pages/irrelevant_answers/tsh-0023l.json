            "answer": "What kind of TSH test ranges are indicated on the report?The only test ranges for TSH I've seen used indicate \"normal\" as falling between 0.5-5.0, or 0.3-4.0.If those are the normal ranges on your lab test, then it would show you being hyper, not hypo.Could you post the test ranges from the report?",

            "answer": "That big L in the title has me confused as well.\"L\" in the \"flag\" column of a test report is used to indicate LOW, which would indicate you are Hyperthyroid.Would the Diabetes affect the test results that much?Did you have your free T3 and free T4 checked as well? Maybe they show you as being Hypothyroid and the Diabetes is skewing the TSH that badly?Tell us more.",
