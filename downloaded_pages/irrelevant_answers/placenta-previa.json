    "question": "Hi there! I was diagnosed at 17+4 with complete previa, and that was also my first bleed. It wasn't bad, but it scared the bejeezuz out of me! Just wondering if there are any ladies or there who have/has this condition? I'm hoping at our scan on 21st that it has migrated at least a little bit. I need some words of encouragement, TIA!",
