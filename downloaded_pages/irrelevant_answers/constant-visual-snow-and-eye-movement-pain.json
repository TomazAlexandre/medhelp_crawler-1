    "question": "I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia/cfs.However, there are a couple symptoms that don\u2019t seem to match with fibromyalgia/CFS. These are, my muscle pain/stiffness is always worse on the left, and with fibro, the pain is supposed to be symmetric on both sides. I also see visible snow anytime I look up, hundreds of them. I have also noticed when I move my eyes the back of my left eye hurts a great deal. And I am always thirsty. I drink water ALL THE TIME.\u00a0\u00a0Have been tested for diabetes and don't have it.Since late December 2007, to this day, I still have my baseline headache. I have gone to bed with the headache and woken up with the same one.",
