            "answer": "Have you had any dg. tests done? CAT scan or X-rays of the urinary tract? Your problem sounds like an abacterial cystitis, where the bladder gets irritated/inflamed. I'd wait about a week or two, take Ibuprofen which is NSAID, and drink LOTS of water.If you tolerate cranberry juice you could try that as well but I'm guessing it'll make your pain worse.",

            "answer": "Hello,Frequent urge to urinate in adults can be due to many causes. The primary cause which needs to be excluded is diabetes. I would advise you to get a fasting blood sugar and Hb A1 C test done.If diabetes is ruled out then other possibilities which need to be ruled out are interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome, stroke and other neurological diseases, urinary incontinence, bladder cancer(rare) and bladder dysfunction .Please consult a urologist in that case.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
