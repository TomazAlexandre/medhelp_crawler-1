            "answer": "I get that also from time to time -- bubbly/foamy urine. \"Google\" will tell you that it could be caused by protein the urine -- did you have yours checked? My urologist told me it's pretty normal and may have to do with my diet, in spite of the fact that I sometimes have trace protein on urine tests.\u00a0\u00a0Western Medicine seems best at dealing with things when they reach a crisis stage FWIW.-- Jim",

    "question": "Has anyone ever heard of this? Several years ago I mentioned to a Doctor of Chinese Medicine that I thought I have Cryoglobulemia because of symtoms I had read about. He told me to watch for a lot of \"bubbles in the urine\" because it could mean that it was affecting my kidneys.Well about a year and a half ago I started noticing a lot of bubbles in my urine. Sometimes it was foamy like the top of a beer. I went to my PCP and she did a bunch of blood and urine tests that all came back normal. My GI said i would have sores if I had Cryo. So I don't really know if I definetly have Cryo.Anyway, I am on week 18 of 24 for type 3a. I am taking shot 19 today. \"YESTERDAY the Bubbles went away for the first time in a year and a half. Has anyone heard of this before. Bubbles in Urine etc. What do you think of it going away all of a sudden?Any input would be appreciatedThanksBobby",
