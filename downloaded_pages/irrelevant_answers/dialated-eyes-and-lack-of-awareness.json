            "answer": "I've had the same thing happen to me, I'm 15 the doctor told me to keep my nutritions up. If he is eating junk food try something healthier. If he gets lightheaded when he stands up and hasn't been doing something active other than relaxing, and gets to the point to where he loses his vision for a few seconds it could be multiple things. My doctor is testing my nutrition first, and going from there.If he is eating properly, get the EEG done and take him to a neurologist before the problem grows, which more than likely it won't.",

            "answer": "His CT came back normal but he is still has dilated eyes. They do react to light. We are going to see a neurologist asap. He is very tired and feels like he is about 90% aware. Blood test and urine test came back normal. They checked for diabetes and drugs. He did pass out on Tuesday when this started. Could this have been a seizure? Please let me know what questions we should ask the neorologist.Thank you for all your help.",

            "answer": "Yes,\u00a0\u00a0it sounds like this could have been a seizure.Did anyone see it?\u00a0\u00a0If someone saw the whole thing and it appeared that he had just simply fainted,\u00a0\u00a0it seems less likely that it was a seizure - than if he woke up feeling like he had fainted but no one actually saw what happened.A person who has a seizure will have no memory of it,\u00a0\u00a0and is unaware while it's happening,\u00a0\u00a0as if they're passed out.And that would explain both the dilated pupils and the \"brain fog\".Best wishes.",

    "question": "My son 1s 15years old and passed out the other day and his pupils were and remain dialated for 3 full days now. No drugs related to this case. He was diagnosed with possible ortho hypostatic tension and told to drink gaterade. He had an ekg done yesterday that was normal. He claims to feel like he is not fully aware and has been extremely tired for the last couple months. He appears to be ok except his pupils remain dialated and he is tired and has dizziness when standing or sitting up. His pupils do react to light. What should we do next?",
