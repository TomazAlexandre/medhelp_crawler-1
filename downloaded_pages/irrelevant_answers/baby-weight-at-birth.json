            "answer": "Oh okayy, because my mom just asked me if they've said anything about how big she would be n they've never said anything about it...so I guess that would probably be because I don't have gestational diabetes, and this is my 1st pregnancy so don't really have a history yet haha.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you!",

            "answer": "My doctor as it got closer basically took a measure of my belly as I am an average size and said 7 to 8 lbs and my daughter turned out to be 7.1lbs so he was right on the money. Hes been doing it for 24 year though so experience definitely helps in my opinion. He didn't even need an ultrasound. I didn't have diabetes or previous large babies either. I just asked him his opinion.",

            "answer": "With my first pregnancy I had an u/s at 39 weeks, they gave me an estimated weight and in the same breath told me it could be off by up to 5 lbs in either direction. The weights aren't accurate, they may be close but they told me my son was going to be close to 12lbs and he was 8'4 when he was born the next day!!\u00a0\u00a0I just assumed they did an u/s close to due date to check position of the baby, but not sure I'll get another one with this one because she's coming via c-section",

            "answer": "For me, It was very hard to get the weight. They went off by an u/s which said my son weighed over 11+ lbs, and he was born 9lbs 15oz - so it kind of is hard to tell. Crazy thing is, they really believed he was going to be 11lbs, estimated or not estimated. Good luck with the pregnancy!",
