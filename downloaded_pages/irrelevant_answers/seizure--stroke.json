            "answer": "Hi, I'm not really sure what the symptoms could be, but I honestly don't think it's seizures or a stroke.\u00a0\u00a0Seizures you would've noticed twitching and loss of bowel or urinary control.\u00a0\u00a0A stroke would've affected one side of the body only, and she wouldn't have recovered so quickly.This could be a thyroid problem, or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0You can try taking her food away for 6-8 hrs so she'll be ready to get tested for diabetes as soon as you get to the vet's office.\u00a0\u00a0They will want her fasted for that test, just like people.\u00a0\u00a0I'd ask for a kidney function test(blood) and get her potassium levels checked, which can cause some weirdness with the muscles(when low).Please let us know how the vet visit goes!!\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",
