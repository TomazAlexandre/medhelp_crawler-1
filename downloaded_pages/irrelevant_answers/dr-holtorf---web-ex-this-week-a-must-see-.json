    "question": "I would just like to extend my support for the MedHelp community to please attend this important feature from Dr. Ken Holtorf on thyroid disease and A1C levels.This will be valuable information on a variety of levels whether insulin resistance is - or is not part of your conditions.This meeting has been a work and progress for me speaking with his office. His reputation on thyroid disease is excellent and in my opinion comparable to \"genuis material\" to be empowered with information on your conditions.This is a must attend for this community and I wanted to extend my deepest appreciation to Dr. Holtorf and his \"team\" of professionals agreeing to come on board.Thank you",
