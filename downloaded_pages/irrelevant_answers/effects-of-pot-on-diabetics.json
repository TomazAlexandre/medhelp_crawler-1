            "answer": "There is not much standardized research done on this due to the illegal nature of marijuana.\u00a0\u00a0You can find MANY websites on the effects of cannibis and blood sugar, though and I am surprised you are on this one asking questions.\u00a0\u00a0Do you really think someone is gonna get on this site and admit to breaking the law?????\u00a0\u00a0Please!I googled your question - the answer I found on two sites was that there is evidence that smoking a 1 gram cannibis cigarette (I will assume that is a medically prescribed item as the website generated from California) showed that it resulted in lowering blood sugar.I personally will stick with\u00a0\u00a0my insulin, exercise and spirituality.\u00a0\u00a0Getting hooked on an addictive substance once in my life (alcohol) was enough and recovering from that is hard enough and I wouldn't want to screw up 2 years of sobriety over some whacked out website stating that pot lowers blood sugar....I'll have to be in WAY more bad of shape with my diabetes before that happens.Good Luck to Ya'",

            "answer": "I actually just ran upon this and quite enjoyed these responses(especially syd420). I too have diabetes Mellitus (i am 20 now and got it when I was 11). I do produce SOME insulin, so perhaps it just depends on each individual diabetic. What i do NOT believe is that MJ can actually HURT a diabetic... because it's not the weed that's doing it, it's the person. You can't blame your 33 year old son's death on pot... because it wasn't the pot. Unfortunately, it was simply his decisions that he made while being high. Being diabetic is hard without being high... I hate it, I hate remembering to take shots, or check my blood sugar... i hate feeling like I have high or low blood sugar... it's a horrible, undeserved, stressful disease. However, if it's your own choice to feast when you have the Munchies... well that's your own dumb fault. If you're going to eat, take insulin too. If you're not going to eat, well you're better off! up until these past 2 years, I never touched pot.... my blood sugars were anywhere from 300-'HI' on my glucose meter (which is something like 600+)... making my A1C around 9.0... when I started smoking pot, I told myself ahead of time, \"Ok, you don't know what this will do, but check your blood sugar every hour while high, don't feed more than normal...\" Guess what? I have an A1C of 6.0 every 3 months I get tested. MJ does not harm you, you harm yourself. If anything, especially if you can't control you blood sugars and can't afford that pill that regulates it... I'd actually SUGGEST MJ! For all I know, if I'd never started smoking... I could be dead right now, or at least lost a limb, gone blind, or gotten nerve damage. I thank God ever day for his blessing... a weed he created that helps multiple diseases (and disorders). Luckily, scientists are doing more research on this theory... so far, my hypotheses (MJ doesn't harm, You harm) is correct. :) If you're going to use a 'drug', use it smart.last note:Cardiovascular diseases... >> 806,156Malignant neoplasms.........>> 562,875Motor Vehicle Crashes.......>> 43,945Drug induced1\t................>> 38,371Septicemia (infections).......>> 34,828Suicide.............................>> 34,598by Firearms.......................>> 31,224Accidental poisoning...........>> 29,846Alcohol induced..................>> 23,199Homicide............................>> 18,361Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)..>>11,295Viral hepatitis......................>> 7,407Cannabis (Marijuana) >>>>>>>\u00a0\u00a00\u00a0\u00a0 <<<<<<<<<<<\u00a0\u00a0meaning, diabetic or not.",
