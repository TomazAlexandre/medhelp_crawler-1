            "answer": "Shortness of breath can be a hypo symptom - I had it pretty bad when I was very hypo, but I don't believe the pain in the left arm, heaviness in the legs are thyroid related.\u00a0\u00a0Neck and jaw \"maybe\", but only if there were large goiter pressing on something essential, in which case that, most likely, would be felt/visible from the outside.IMO - other things need to be checked out. Hashimoto's doesn't cause the symptoms -- resulting hypo does.",
