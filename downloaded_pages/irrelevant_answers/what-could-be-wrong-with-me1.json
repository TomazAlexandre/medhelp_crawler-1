            "answer": "Hey there, it pretty much just looks like you've having anxiety events which believe it or not are very bad when you go through it. By not sleeping enough your body can actually make the anxiety feel even worse. Working out helps a lot with anxiety, but then again you also need your sleep schedule to be on track. Avoid caffeine, and anything that could act like an anti-depressant to you. I suffer from anxiety myself and I know exactly how it feels. Feel better soon:)",

            "answer": "Yeah, that definitely sounds like anxiety symptoms - I also have anxiety, and it affects you physically. It might be good to talk to someone, though, and get a proper diagnose rather than an Internet one ;) If it's possible for you to get in contact with a counselor or therapist, I think that would be a good idea.",

    "question": "i have been feeling weird lately and i don't know what it could be! i am now 17 years old and i have always worried too much about my health. on multiple occasions i worried a lot only to find out there was actually nothing wrong with me. what i'm feeling is: when i'm sitting down, i feel myself shaking, like there's an earthquake, but it's actually just my body. it's just a little and has been going on for less than a week. i feel tired throughout the day, both sleepy and fatigued, but i feel like it might just be lack of sleep. and i feel pains in my chest, not actual pains, but like it's really heavy, and sometimes i feel like it's beating really fast when it's actually not. i read online that the thing with my heart can mean anxiety, which would make sense because i think i have been very stressed.also, i kept thinking that i could have diabetes, but i don't match all of the symptoms online. i used to eat really badly, and now i still eat lots of sweets, but i also eat healthy foods everyday, and i exercise all the time and have to walk long distances to and from train stations to go to school and back home everyday, and i also have P.E. in school so i don't think i am sedentary or anything.i am trying my best to be even healthier everyday, but i am growing progressively worried and i can't find any diseases online with symptoms that match the ones i feel.",
