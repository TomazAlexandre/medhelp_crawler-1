            "answer": "It is completely normal to have a period that lasts 2 days long (in fact, mine usually last 2-3 days). That doesn't mean you're pregnant nor does it have to do with pregnancy.However, if you are missing periods, that's another story. How long are your cycles (the time between each period)? If you're irregular then it'll be difficult to know when your next period is due.A pregnancy test is most accurate after you miss a period.",

    "question": "Hi,I have taken pregnancy tests over the last few months all of which have come back negative. I finally relaxed and stopped worry about it and thought if it happens it happens.\u00a0\u00a0However the reason i have taken the tests is because my periods changed 6months ago and I went from having a 5-6day period to a 2day long period. This is still happening so when i realised that i'm needing to go to the toilet alot more frequently i started to wonder...however these two things on top\u00a0\u00a0the fact that i think i may have pile like things and my breasts are very sensitive and i have white spots on my nipples....is this a phantom pregnancy or is this not a coincidence and i'm actually expecting!? Please help me!!",
