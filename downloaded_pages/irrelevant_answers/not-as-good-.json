            "answer": "Hi,it is tough being a teenager with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I would like to give you some ideas on what to do, which ideally you will work out with your dr or medical team.Firstly what meds are you on?\u00a0\u00a0Are you on basal - bolus insulins?\u00a0\u00a0ie. a long acting for overnight and a short acting for meals?First thing to do is to determine if your dosages of insulin are right.\u00a0\u00a0You can find this out by doing something called basal testing.\u00a0\u00a0You can look the procedure for this online. Then you will also test to work out the correct dosing of insulin for meals.\u00a0\u00a0This will give you a carb:insulin ratio.If you can fairly correctly estimate your dosage of insulin, based on what you eat, you should have less swings. Further a low carb diet (less carbs means less insulin means less chance of mistakes) may also help.\u00a0\u00a0Fat has no impact on blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0Protein has less impact than carbs.\u00a0\u00a0The timing of dosing relative to when you eat can also make a big difference. This is called Prebolusing.\u00a0\u00a0You have to work out the timing that works for you, but effectively you may take your mealtime insulin 15 - 30 minutes\u00a0\u00a0before eating... then when you eat the insulin is already active to prevent the spike.You will need to learn a lot so you can manage this well and still get on with living your life.I would recommend the following books:Think Like A Pancreas,, by John WalshUsing InsulinYou can also go to Bernstein Diabetes University on Utube, which has many great sessions on different aspects of managing diabetes.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Please do come back and ask more questions and we will do our best to answer you.\u00a0\u00a0Certainly you are not a,lone as there is a huge worldwide community of people who are also dealing with this... and that is a great source of information and advice.",

            "answer": "Hey! I've been told I'm in the 'teenage stage' too.It may feel like nothing is working but are you doing heaps of exercise or are you stressed/getting sick. If you're a girl are you extra high during your period time. All of this is what they say.But really it's because of the carb counting, I'm on an insulin pump and I'm high all the time as well but when I sit down and calculate my food properly it actually brings my levels down and if it doesn't I give myself a basal rate of 200% for 4 hours to make sure I don't get ketones. Always make sure you test your ketones to make sure you're okay. If you're ketones come up drink heaps of water and do the usual.Maybe start of by eating foods with hardly any carbs in them such as chicken and salads! That's what I did and I maintained my levels, then you can slowly start building carbs and see what affects your levels and what doesn't!! Really hope this helped,If you need anyone to talk to don't hesitate to email me x",

    "question": "I have type 1 and I am not as good as everyone else but I'm only in my teenage phase and I'm the only one in my family who has it so it can be a little more difficult to handle. But I don't understand is when I eat and I take medicine for it it never seems to be the right amount and I go to my doctor they change it but I'm usally high sometimes and when I take more it is like I drop really low like in 50s and I don't know what I should do. Help if you understand! Thanks:)",
