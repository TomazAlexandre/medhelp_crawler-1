            "answer": "I too, have some anxiety at times - sometimes severe and was once agoraphobic for a few months, but luckily with the help of a good psych and combo of correct meds I came out of it.\u00a0\u00a0But, I still struggle with anxiety off and on.\u00a0\u00a0I have tingling in the hands and feet when I am stressed/anxious - I thought I had MS or diabetes too.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have either.\u00a0\u00a0I do have peripheral neuropathy - which is not tingling but actual burning - it sucks.\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, my point is, yes, you can manifest physical symptoms from anxiety and you can make yourself physically sick.\u00a0\u00a0For one thing - stress makes hormones flood your body that can bring down your immune system (so you get colds more etc) and also can decrease blood flow to your extremities - causing that tingly feeling in your fingers and toes - close to a panic attack.\u00a0\u00a0Jump on the anxiety forum and you'll see:)\u00a0\u00a0Get a good psychiatrist and counselor quick.\u00a0\u00a0Anxiety is the most treatable of all \"mental\" issues.\u00a0\u00a0Take care now and\u00a0\u00a0breathe!!!!",
