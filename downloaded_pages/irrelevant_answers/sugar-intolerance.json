See if that would help your trembling. If not then, I recommend you see the MD who suggested it to be anxiety.",

            "answer": "Is it possible that you're hypoglycemic? It you're trembling all the time and eating something helps at times, this could be part of the problem. I would also recommend eating small, frequent meals that are low in carbs (esp. sugar) and high in protein. I also have a sugar intolerance and I have to cut out all refined sugars and carbs and I'm eating a lot more protein and veggies.",

            "answer": "Diabetic blood testing would show if a person was diabetic or hypoglycemic. This test then would help the MD to properly treat the patient. For either condition it is good to eat 5-6 small meals a day. With Hypoglycemia, it is recommended not to eat too much carbohydrates pre meal and actually eat more protein to help the blood sugar not to decrease rapidly. Thank you for your comments.",

    "question": "HI, I REALLY HOPE THAT SOMEONE CAN HELP! I AM A 27 YEAR OLD FEMALE WHICH OVER THE PAST YEAR I HAVE HAD NO END OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS. ALTHOUGH MOST OF MY PROBLEMS HAVE EITHER BEEN RESOLVED OR ARE GETTING BETTER THERE IS THIS MAIN PROBLEM WHICH IS REALLY FRUSTRATING ME. I SUFFER FROM REALLY BAD TREMBLING ALL OVER MY BODY 24 HOURS A DAY 7 DAYS A WEEK WHICH CAN BE QUITE EMBARRASING AT TIMES. I HAVE RECENTLY DONE A FOOD INTOLERANCE TEST WHICH CAME BACK THAT I AM SENSITIVE TO CHICKEN, LOBSTER AND SUGAR! IVE HAD A DIABETES BLOOD TEST WHICH CAME BACK NEGATIVE BUT I DO EXPERIANCE SOME OF THE DIABETES SYMPTOMS LIKE VERY DRY MOUTH, ECZEMA ON SCALP, TREMBLING, SOMETIMES A LITTLE BLURRED VISION! I FIND THAT WHEN I EAT SOMETHING CONTAINING SUGAR LIKE A BISCUIT OR CHOCOLATE MY TREMBLING COOLS DOWN BUT DOESN'T STOP COMPLETELY. I HAD THE FOOD INTOLERANCE TEST DONE AS I GET ALOT OF HEAD ACHES AND MIGRAINS WITH VISUAL DISTURBANCES AND PROBLEMS WITH THE SKIN CONDITION IN MY EARS AND THROAT. I HAVE ALWAYS SUFFERED WITH HEAD ACHES AND MIGRANES SINCE FROM A YOUNG AGE BUT RECENTLY MY EARS HAVE BEEN A VERY HARD BATTLE TO WIN AS THEY ARE ALWAYS QUITE SOAR! I AM CURRENTLY BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS TO MY ENT DOCTOR WHICH HE JUST PRESCRIBES ME CREAM FOR MY EARS AND SOLUTION FOR MY THROAT! ALSO I HAVE BEEN ON MEDICATION FOR A SLIGHT OVERACTIVE THYROID WHICH I HAVE RECENTLY STOPPED AS MY THYROID LEVELS ARE BACK TO NORMAL! I HAVE ALSO HAD A CT SCAN TO RULE OUT ANYTHING WRONG IN MY HEAD WHICH ALSO CAME BACK AS NORMAL! MY DOCTOR HAS TOLD ME THAT IM PROBABLY SUFFERING FROM ANXIETY BUT I DON'T FEEL THAT THIS IS WHAT IS CAUSING MY TREMBLING. I AM A HAPPY, EASY GOING PERSON LIVING AND COPING WITH LIFES EVERY DAY STRESSES, I WOULD JUST REALLY LOVE TO PUT AN END TO ALL THESE SYMPTOMS OR JUST TO FIND SOME KIND OF UNDERSTANDING! IF ANYONE CAN HELP I WOULD BE SO MUCH APPRIECIATED!!!",
