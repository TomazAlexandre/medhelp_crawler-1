Did he say anything specific about the tumor?\u00a0\u00a0In certain situations, biopsy may be appropriate, but in some instances it's important to know it can do more harm than good.\u00a0\u00a0Did your doctor recommend against biopsy, or did he suggest one?As far as the liver biopsy itself, if you have no bleeding issues it is considered a relatively safe procedure.\u00a0\u00a0My husband underwent one a few years ago, and it was done with sedation -- he was not \"out,\" but sleepy, and didn't feel any pain during or after.\u00a0\u00a0Hope that helps.\u00a0\u00a0~eureka",
