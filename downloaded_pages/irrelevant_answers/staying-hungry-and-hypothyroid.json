            "answer": "I understand the need for food. First of all let me say I am personally an emotional eater and food has been a big part of my life. I grew up around adults who always felt it necessary to have you eat when you visited.Food became related to family gatherings too. Anyhow here's part of my story------A few years ago I had to help my son lose a few lbs. for football so I helped him by watching carbs and sugar intake which we did together- well low and behold my son and I both lost weight- him enough to play ball and me enough to not have to shop in plus or extra large sizes. I managed to maintain it for a long time until I had my thyroid removed this past december. I put on 15lbs since and fluctuate daily with 2&3 lb. gain or loss.Now being in the hypo phase and still having a TSH out of range I am having difficulty with my weight again. I watch more carefully now the sugar and carbs I eat and make sure my snacks are low calorie and high in protein, also drink tons of water. I have less hunger pains when I eat enough protein and drink enough water. I personally MUST exercise daily even if for example today i don't feel well but I still walked the dog around a few blocks- it's better than nothing.Everyone is different in our make & model so to speak and what works for me may not work for you. Just keep trying and don't give up. Food can be fun if it doesn't rule our lives. The best things in life are free and lets face it even a big mac costs money! So where one diet might fail there's another that will work- try until you find something that works and believe me when they say it truly is a lifestyle change!~ Best Wishes",
