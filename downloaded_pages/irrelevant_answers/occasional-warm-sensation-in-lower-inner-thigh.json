            "answer": "Oooh, bizarre!!!!The only \"warm\" sensations I ever have are more along the lines of \"burning\" and only come during *that time of the month*.... According to my OB, it's radiating nerve pain because my right ovary swells up and presses against a nerve.This sounds NOTHING like that though.... Does it actually fell wet?This post seems to touch on similar symptoms:http://www.medhelp.org/posts/Neurology/Cold-Wet-Feeling-on-an-area-on-my-leg/show/509541It sounds like ti's something you should bring up with your physician. Have you had any recent illnesses?",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!A heat sensation or sudden feeling of warmth can be a sign of blood clot or deep vein thrombosis. It can also be due to pinched nerve or due to diabetic neuropathy. If you are on birth control pills, then this could be due to the side effect of pills as they can also cause deep vein thrombosis. For diagnosis first a duplex ultrasound or color dopplar would need to be done. If this is negative then a nerve conduction study and test for diabetes. If there is a chance then if everything else is negative, then lupus may need to be tested for.Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Take care!",
