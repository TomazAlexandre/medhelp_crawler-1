            "answer": "Hi, I have had yeast infections on several occasions following antibiotic treatment for UTI, kidney infections. I have also had this passed from my wife to me and the other way around.Symptoms mostly was a rash on the glans and itchyness. I would not really describe the sensation like pain, discomfort yes.I don't know if that answers your question. In the case of a sexula partner both should be treated at the same time, other wise you will be passing the infection on to each other.In the case of an uncircumcised male, one must retract the foreskin completely and use Canesten or Monistat cream and cover the complete surface of the glans and penile skin exposed. Return the foreskin to the normal position and once again cover the complete surface of the penis. It is also a good idea to take probiotics and if you like it, yoghurt.It can very difficult at times to get an infection under control.All the best.Ron",

            "answer": "Hello,Pain at tip of penis can be due to fungal infection, prostatitis, allergic dermatitis or STD\u2019s. Frequent rubbing of clothes on a hypersensitive tip of penis can often keep it stimulated and cause increased semen volume. Get yourself tested for diabetes as presence of this can cause mild infection.If all these are ruled out then a peripheral artery disease (by dopplar ultrasound) and a peripheral nerve disease will have to be looked into. I suggest you an immediate urologist\u2019s evaluation to check out these possibilities and confirm the diagnosis after investigations.I sincerely hope that helps. Take care.",
