Just not on a daily basis anymore :)\u00a0\u00a0But, yes. It does really help with regulating a cycle. It mimics the Luteal phase of you cycle. A great place to start.",

    "question": "I just got my results back from my doctor, he says that I have PCOS. Good thing is that he didnt see any cysts on the ultrasound, so it could be worse. I have high cholesterol and high free testosterone and he wants me to be tested for diabetes. Since we are TTC but it has only been 5 months he put me on Provera. He said it would make me have a period and then if I take it again on cycle day 12-22 it should also help me ovulate. If anyone else has been on this before please let me know, he seemed certain but I haven't heard of this helping to get pregnant. I am supposed to see him again in 2 months so he knows if the provera is doing its job and after the magic year mark of TTC he might try something like Clomid.",
