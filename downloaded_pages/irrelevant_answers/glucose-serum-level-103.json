    "question": "Hi. Iam 64 years old, and had a heart attack 4 years ago. My grandparents had diabetes. I had recent dizzyness (usually at night), and went to my cardiologist about it, nad he took me off one of my blood pressue meds. Dizzyness seems better. They gave me a blood test, and my Glucose Serum came in at 103. It had been 87 about 3 months ago. This latest bloodtest was given to me about an hour after I had a glass of orange juice, and an english muffin with peanut butter. I believe that I had also not fasted before the blood test 3 months ago. I did not know I was having blood work , that's why I had not fasted. Do you think I should have another blood test after fasting ? I'm not sure how much of a difference the juice/muffin could make. I will also ask my GP.Appreciate our input. Thanks.Thanks.",
