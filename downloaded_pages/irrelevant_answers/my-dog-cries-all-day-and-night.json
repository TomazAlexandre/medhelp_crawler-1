            "answer": "I think Caryopteris has a good idea.\u00a0\u00a0If you use a non-narcotic pain medication, and he quiets down and seems peaceful, then he pretty much had to have been in pain.\u00a0\u00a0(If it is a narcotic pain med, and he quiets down, you still won't know if it was because of pain relief or because of sedative side effects.)\u00a0\u00a0Also, since he is diabetic, I wonder if he is hungry.\u00a0\u00a0Is he on a special diet, and I wonder if that could be it?\u00a0\u00a0Like, maybe he needs a higher-protein diet to keep from being so hungry?\u00a0\u00a0I'm just grasping at straws here, but if my dog cried 24/7, I would definitely be desperate.",

            "answer": "Please let \"us\" know how your dog is doing.After replying that your dog might be frightened (I hope I didn't add a new worry) I did a small search for \"blind dog\" on this forum and found the following post which seems related:\"It is possibly diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Please take your dog to the vet.\u00a0\u00a0Dogs do very well adjusting to a sense taken away.....unlike people.\u00a0\u00a0They compensate very rapidly and do fine. However, YOu need to find the underlying cause as to why this has happened and get the necessary treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 \"The leads me to believe your dog can adjust to blindness, and the reply above suggests diabetes which is another match.\u00a0\u00a0So the inputs about treating the diabetes and possible hunger or pain may be the path to a good nights sleep and some relief from the grief of dealing with a loved dog that is suffering.I am sure there is a whole \"book\" on dealing with a blind dog... must include keeping things in the same physical location, and moving only if that makes for easier access.\u00a0\u00a0I suppose a dog's already good senses of smell (hope that is still working) helps them find their way around the house.",

You can use an electric water feeder that he can hear to find his dishes,\u00a0\u00a0do you have other pets?\u00a0\u00a0If so, put a small bell on them and put one on your shoe so he can hear that you are there.\u00a0\u00a0If he does not sleep in a pen area or crate, you might want to try that and give him a nice blanket, a couple of soft toys.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe try setting an alarm clock near him or a radio set on low volume. If it is cold, maybe try putting a sweater on him at night. Try to maybe build up his confidence with a few simple commands like sit and down then reward and praise.\u00a0\u00a0Give him something to chew on, bulky stick, denta bone, etc.\u00a0\u00a0maybe try a stuffed Kong to see if that will interest him.Hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and keep us posted.",

            "answer": "Thanks everyone for the advice. He's been diabetic since we adopted him 5 years ago. He's on a special diet to manage his diabeties. He has a bed in my parents room that we have him sleep on. He does have trouble walking because he walks around in circles all the time and being blind he tends to bump into stuff but that's not what is causing him to cry. He'll just lay on his bed and cry for no reason. Most of the time when he cries hes just laying on his bed crying for what looks to be no reason, hes not hungry, thirsty or have to go out hes just crying. Some days are better then others and he doesn't cry as much. We've taken him to the vet twice now and they said he's not in pain or hungry or thirsty or anything when he does this. They said he's just anxious and upset about not being able to see. The music helps him sometimes doing the day so he doesn't think he's alone. I think we're gonna try going to the vet again to see what they suggest will help him to stop crying",

I think.My first response raised the issue of the stress on the dog of being blind.\u00a0\u00a0Then found testimony to the effect that dogs do a better job adjusting than do people, I can believe that, the loss has got to be a disaster to man or beast.I hope you get some more ideas here, seems the music (radio) provides some help as might an old fashioned ticking clock, maybe wrapped in a shirt of other cloths item that is scented with one of you who he loves and trusts.Is the crying a whimper or is he howling?\u00a0\u00a0Just a question, I have no answer to either case.Our Westie is near def, but that is a much less handicap.\u00a0\u00a0Still I try not to surprise him when I approach him from behind.\u00a0\u00a0For a blind dog I guess a \"rule\" would be not to move thing around that he might run into.\u00a0\u00a0That may have already been suggested.Bless you in your struggle to make the dog as comfortable as you can.",

He still takes it today, we were going to whean him off of it, but we had a house fire and had to move and he was very sensative to the whole situation, he even lets you know when it's time for his meds.

The problem I am having is that he cries and wines all day and all night long for no reason. He walks around in circles and then just stands there or lays on his bed at night crying. Nothing we do will make him stop crying. We've taken him to the vet and they said nothing is physically wrong with him, and that he's not in pain at all. Yet he cries for hours at a time. He sleeps for like an hour at a time and then cries for 4 hours before sleeping for a few minutes again. No one in my house is sleeping because we can't get him to stop, please help! Also we have tried giving him some children's Benadryl as per vets orders and it still won't make him sleep nothing is working",
