            "answer": "Hello,Kidney diseases have been ruled out by CT scan. Lower back pain and frequent urination can be due to spinal causes causing pinched nerve, diabetes, interstitial cystitis, overactive bladder syndrome, neurological diseases, urinary incontinence and bladder dysfunction. In females, urethritis has to be ruled out. It is a primarily female syndrome in which women suffer from irritative bladder symptoms (urinary frequency, urgency, burning\u00a0\u00a0and a hesitant or slowed urinary stream) in the absence of any objective urologic findings.I suggest you to get it evaluated from a urologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
