    "question": "I am a 29 year old white female.\u00a0\u00a0I was found to have SVT during my first/only pregnancy so far.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on medication dialthezem immediate release 120 4X/day to discourage the episodes which I still had most days from 29 weeks pregnancy until I delivered at 35 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I went into preterm labour when they found the SVT but managed to stay pregnant on bed rest in the hospital for 6 additional weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I was also diagnosed with gestational diabetes at 29 weeks and was on insulin throughout the rest of the pregnancy.\u00a0\u00a0I was diagnosed with hemochromatosis at age 20 as well.\u00a0\u00a0I am on a waiting list for ablasion surgery because the episodes have not stopped since delivery - I am currently on 360 slow release dialthezem and 25 mg metoprolol 2X/day to control the episodes.\u00a0\u00a0Do you think it is possible that my heart condition caused the pre-term labour?\u00a0\u00a0Are there any other medications I could take instead of the metoprolol as I am having almost all the side effects listed for this drug and the waiting list of surgery is months long!Heather Watt",
