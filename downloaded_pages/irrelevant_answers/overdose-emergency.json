            "answer": "I'm sorry I'm late finding this post and I hope by now you've either started feeling better, or have sought medical attention.\u00a0\u00a0More than likely what you're experiencing (experienced) was a case of low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0As I'm sure you know, the Glyburide-Metformin helps to lower the blood sugar of someone who has diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0If you take it and don't have diabetes, it can cause an unsafe drop in your blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0This drop can cause the symptoms that you describe, and if left untreated, could also lead to coma and death.\u00a0\u00a0One way to help raise your blood sugar level again is to eat or drink something that has sugar in it, such as a candy bar, orange juice, even a banana would help to a certain extent.I would also suggest that you keep the number for Poison Control handy (800-222-1222).\u00a0\u00a0As I'm sure you've noticed, while the internet CAN be a good source of information, including medical information, it can sometimes take time to receive answers - and sometimes time is not on your hands when you're dealing with medication.\u00a0\u00a0Poison Control can very easily tell you if the symptoms you're experiencing are related to the medication you've taken and what you need to do - whether it be wait it out, induce vomiting, go to the ER, etc.I hope you're feeling much better now.\u00a0\u00a0As far as permanently damaging your blood sugar, it's doubtful with one dose of the Glyburide-Metformin causing low blood sugar - of course, providing you got medical attention or were able to treat the low blood sugar at home.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not saying that if you didn't get medical attention or treat it at home that your blood sugar could/would be permanently damaged, but left untreated, the EFFECTS of low blood sugar could cause permanent damage to your body if it is severe enough.One last thing - I hope you will take whatever steps necessary to avoid this happening again in the future.\u00a0\u00a0I'm presuming this was an accident - you didn't realize you were taking this medication - but as you know, it's VERY important (and also illegal if you do) to not take a prescriptioin medication that has not been prescribed for you.\u00a0\u00a0Even if the medication has been prescribed for someone else who is experiencing the same type of problem you may be, it's still not safe, wise, or legal.\u00a0\u00a0One medication that may be right and helpful for another person could be very wrong and dangerous for you.Best of luck and please let us know how you're doing.",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Hope you feel well now. The symptoms were due to low blood sugar. Drinking glucose mixed in water, sweetened fruit juice, taking something sweet would help. By now you would have eaten something and feeling better. No, this will not damage the blood sugar control on a permanent basis.Hope this helps. Take care!",
