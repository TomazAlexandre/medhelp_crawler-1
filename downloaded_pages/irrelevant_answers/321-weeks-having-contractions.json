            "answer": "Im in the same boat,two days ago was my third time at labor and delivery with contractions. All together ive had 3 shots and a bag of fluids and they always come back when I go home. I have gestational diabetes so water is basically all I drink anyways and my cervix is still closed as well. My doctor said some women just contract like that, which really, really *****. I've found that hot showers/baths help me a lot.\u00a0\u00a0This is my third baby but first experience with all this. My doctor doesn't think he will come early. I hope things get better for you soon.",

    "question": "I been to the hospital twice already to stop my contractions they put me on an IV for fluid. According to them I need to drink even more water but I already drink water non stop all day! Is anyone else going threw this? The IV help slow down my contractions but once I'm back home they start again. They checked my cervix and say it's still closed. It's my first baby so I'm nervous that it might mean she's coming out before her due date September 16. Any suggestions or advice? Greatly appreciate it",
