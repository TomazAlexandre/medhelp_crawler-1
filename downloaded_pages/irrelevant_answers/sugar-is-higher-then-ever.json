            "answer": "Yes, 195 is too high. It is likely that your hypoglycemia has progressed to diabetes. Normal blood sugars are: fasting under 100, 100-125 pre-diabetes and 126 and over diabetes. Your 2 hour postprandials should be under 140 and even better under 120. You should see the doctor and get an A1C and a diagnosis. Meanwhile you should start cutting your carb intake, getting regular exercise and if you need to losing weight. Yes, your blurry eyes are from high blood sugar. You are not in an immediate danger at 195 but prolonged time spent over 140 is what forms diabetic complications so you need to be treated with diet change, exercise, weight loss if needed and oral meds if needed to reduce your blood sugar.",

            "answer": "Zoelula has explained everything very well.My two-cents worth is that you need to hook-up with a diabetes center and a professional R.N. or physician's assistant who runs a program to help people in managing diabetes. There are lots of these in every city and hospital.\u00a0\u00a0These people are really good at what they do. You will take regular blood sticks and they will be downloaded on their computer and after some experimentation the right combination of medications and diet will be worked out. They will tell you exactly when to take the blood sugar readings. Usually they will have a class (or two) and then periodic visits for consultion. On the way you will meet with a dietician.\u00a0\u00a0You will bring\u00a0\u00a0your meter and a food log\u00a0\u00a0when you meet with the R.N...It is almost impossible to do this by yourself.The first thing, of course, is to get a physician's evaluation of exactly where you are at. My preference is for a physician who specializes in diabetes, rather than your G.P. They may have a consultation with an endochronologist. At this time the exact varient of diabetes will be determined (there are several), and they will set you up with a plan of action.",

    "question": "I have had Hypoglycemia for as long as I can remember. my normal range has been 25-45 for as long as I can remember.In the last month or so I have noticed that any time I ate anything containing sugar I have become feeling very ill.Nausea accompanied by very blurry vision. Shortness of breath, with a feeling that the floor is swaying under my feet.My heart seems to be slightly racing. My normal blood pressure is around 75/65. Today my BP is 160/8. Purchased a brand new meter and my sugar level was higher then i have ever know it to be @195.Should I be concerned? My vision has cleared some what, but I still feel as if I may hurl at any moment. At what point should I become concerned?I do know in the 400-500 range is very bad, and could cause a stroke. I am just confused if there is\u00a0\u00a0any dangers for meat 195. I have never been higher the 85 ever. Going to lay down now. Will check back in a bit. Thank's So Much, clicksmama",
