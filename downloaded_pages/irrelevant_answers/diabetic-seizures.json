            "answer": "Hi Bettyboop!\u00a0\u00a0I am so sorry to hear that you experienced a seizure due to a low blood sugar.\u00a0\u00a0I know how scary that can be.\u00a0\u00a0The best advice I can think to share with you, since I am not a medical professional, is to test frequently (at least 6 times per day)so that you know where your bg is at.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure to check yourself before you go to sleep and depending on how active you were during the day and what your bg is, you may need to do a 2-3am bg check.\u00a0\u00a0Nighttime lows can be unpredictable, so make sure that you have juice boxes handy in case you are low and need something.\u00a0\u00a0You don't mention how long you've had diabetes, so I want to encourage you, that if you are newly diagnosed, to visit the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation website at www.jdrf.org and click on the section designated for the newly diagnosed and someone from the online diabetes support team can be assigned to you to answer any specific questions/needs you may have.\u00a0\u00a0They can also offer support from your local JDRF chapter if you wish so that you can have local community support also.\u00a0\u00a0My 19 year old daughter has had diabetes for 17 years now and she has only had one seizure and that was in the first year after diagnosis...so being diligent about checking your bg pays off, not just immediately, but also by having your bg within a good range, in the long run to avoid complications.\u00a0\u00a0Please feel free to reach out to us and let us know how we can help you in the future.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "I have been a diabetis since I was 7yrs old and now I am 27 almost 28. I have been doing great on a insulin pump for the past three years ,but for the last year I have had some complications with seizures.I have a very active lifestyle and am in great shape.I have experienced some seizures when my blood sugars have been above 120mg/dl. I have seen a nerologist and have had a mri and an eeg scan done. The nerologist said I had a seizure for about 45 seconds when I was sleeping. Since then I have been put on some Anti-seizure medication. Has any body else ever run across this? I am curious if my dibeties has had an effect on the seizures?I have since lost my driving privileges. This has caused me to have a couple of driving accidents,luckly nobody including myself were hurt, but I have been charged with neglegent endangerment. I am trying to get as much information as I can to find out some answers, any replys would be appreciatedThanks, Peej",
