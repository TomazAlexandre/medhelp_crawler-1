I have experienced the same thing that you are going through and even though I feel such a strong sense of doom it always passes. Deep breathes and reassuring affirmation will help.",

    "question": "I'm 20 years old, I have a pretty severe panic disorder and high levels of anxiety. This causes me to become the worst hypochondriac on the planet. I just woke up after sleeping for an hour and I immediately felt like death was creeping up on me. The left side of my chest feels tight. Well I don't even know how to describe it. I can pinpoint the general area the discomfort is in, but it's a dull aching pain I feel dizzy, but I'm not sure if that's just because I'm really tired. I notice some discomfort in my left arm, but I don't know if that's just because I'm constantly thinking about it. My lip is bleeding. I feel like I might throw up, but I'm also really scared right now.I try to lay down and fall back asleep but that just makes me feel worse to the point where I feel like if I lie down any longer I will die. Doctors have told me the chest pain could be due to acid reflux. It was Thanksgiving today and I ate probably way too much, only to eat leftover chinese food later in the evening.This has happened before, where I just wake up and feel like death. Actually I haven't had a good night's sleep in months. But each time I find myself going to the internet to hopefully convince myself I'm not having a heart attack.I got an EKG eight months ago and there was nothing wrong there. As far as I'm aware there aren't any heart conditions that run in my family. I do have type 1 diabetes which could be better controlled but I don't think it would be life threatening. I really just want to make sure I'm not having a heart attack. I really can't afford a trip to the ER.I'm so tired, and fatigued. I just want to go back to sleep but I'm so scared of death that I can't. I just don't want to die. I want to sleep and relax. This fear is driving me crazy.",
