            "answer": "Can you put the exact wording from the MRI report?If it says anything about apoplexy, which can mean that the tumor was larger, but basically exploded - you luckily avoided what could have been a life threatening incident. Your hormones can still be effected and the doctor that is treating you may or may not be testing the proper set of hormones. I suggest\u00a0\u00a0you find a neuro-endo at a pituitary center. There are some links in the health pages - now at the bottom under the forum here - to help find a center but you may have to travel. Get copies of everything - MRIs, labs, etc. and make sure you stay on top of what is going on.7,5mm is still in the micro-adenoma stage - and while a yearly MRI is fine, more blood work is usually needed. For instance, I go every 3-4 months. Testing interval should be based on stability and since you have little by way of baseline - they should be testing you more, not less. If the doc says 6 months, find another doctor.",

            "answer": "it's important to find out if this tumor is a secreting adenoma or not. If it secretes hormones it could really screw with your hormones. The most common types are prolactin and ACTH secreting adenomas. It is also important to know how close this thing is to your optic nerves and carotid arteries, as you want that bugger out if it is getting close.If you underwent appoplexy it might have hit some nerves too.Do you have headaches?I had partial apoplexy of a cyst in my pit gland, followed by surgery and now I have had a chronic headaches since.Many generalist endo unfortunately don't know how to do the testing. They deal with diabetes and maybe thyroid albeit poorly. A lot us pitpats have learned this the hard way and been the guinea pigs. Then the internet came and we all started talking and we found out about the good and bad.If it is not a secreter, and not too close to the optic nerves/carotids and no longer bleeding then a wait and watch approach could be fine.Horselip",

            "answer": "I agree with horselip - your test results should be able to pinpoint whether it's a secreting adenoma and the type.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you ask these questions.\u00a0\u00a0If you don't know to ask, you most likely will not get answers.\u00a0\u00a07.5mm is large enough for concern.\u00a0\u00a0If a doctors tells you something and you don't understand what they are saying - ask them to explain it in layman terms or draw you a picture.BestWishes,",
