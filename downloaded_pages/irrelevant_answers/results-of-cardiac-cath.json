            "answer": "Hi BSN,Good question.\u00a0\u00a0The first thing I would recommend doing is asking your doctor directly why he changed his answer.\u00a0\u00a0He may have a very good reason.\u00a0\u00a0One possibility is that his first estimate was based on just looking at the image and estimating.\u00a0\u00a0There is software that measures the dimensions of the heart during contraction and relaxation and is shown to be more reliable than just estimating.\u00a0\u00a0that is one possiblity.\u00a0\u00a0If there is any question, an echocardiogram would be a great way to evaluate your heart function and pressures.Did he meassure ventricular pressures while he was doing the cath?\u00a0\u00a0With the lower extremity swelling, it is important to know the left ventricular end diastolic pressure.\u00a0\u00a0This will give an idea of your left sided heart pressure and increased left heart pressures are causing your edema.Endothelial function is something to be taken very seriously, especially with a potentially treated cause like familial hypercholesterolemia.\u00a0\u00a0Familial hypercholeralemia is sometimes a very difficult disease to treat but is usually improved by high dose statins plus/minus other mediations.\u00a0\u00a0Make sure you are doing everything\u00a0\u00a0you can to manage this risk factor like no smoking, regular exercise, weight control (try to keep you BMI less than 24), as well as control of any high blood pressure or diabetes.I hope this helps.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks for posting and good luck.",

    "question": "I recently had a cath done and while there were no significant blockages found, the cardiologist told me my EF was 40%. This was a surprise as I have no diagnosed CHF. I had reported +2 peripheral edema after working and rarely I'll notice this is still present the next morning.I don't have SOB w/ this. I do notice some SOB after eating, no matter the size of the meal. Two weeks after my cath I had a f/u appointment with the cardiologist and he told me then that my EF was 50%. How did the value change when no other tests were done after the cath? I don't know if you need this info to answer my question but my actual diagnosis for the frequent chest pain is only endothelial dysfunction. I also have familial hypercholesterolemia.",
