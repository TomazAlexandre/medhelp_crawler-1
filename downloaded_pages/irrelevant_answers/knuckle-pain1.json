            "answer": "I ate borscht which is a cold beet soup and immediately had allergy symptoms in my uvula and my knuckle hurt for the first time in my life. I had been told to try to eliminate capsaicin and black pepper and red pepper and cayenne and paprika from my diet and possibly eggplant so having\u00a0\u00a0a reaction to beet soup surprised me. Then I looked up the nightshade family and found that not only are spices and peppers and eggplant and potatoes and ketchup all come from the same family, but in the sentence that followed it said beets have the same ingredient which is a natural pesticide. An allergist told me that food allergies do not show up well on tests neither positively\u00a0\u00a0nor negatively. So one is supposed to do an elimination diet for 3 months. I sure hope I am not allergic to tomatoes and to sweet peppers.",
