            "answer": "Hah! there are so many meters and my answer should be I like all of them.Honestly, you need to get one that insurance covers, if it is easy, small amount of blood and no coding required there are a few out there, Contour, One Touch, Freestyle Lite, BD, etc. (even walmart brand meters). Go to the website Childrenwithdiabetes.com and see the reviews as well with the choices that your plan covers.So if you have an endocrinologist(I forget but if you do) call them and talk with their nurse educator by phone,tell them your insurance and that you want to monitor his sugar, they may even have you come in for a free meter and prescribe the strips for you.If you don't ask your pediatrician to prescribe one and talk with your pharmacist about which are covered on your plan, strips cost almost $1 per strip so use them wisely and be sure that they are covered.",

            "answer": "Do NOT buy one! $100-$150 out of pocket. You have concerns, you have a peds endo (right?) and if someone says he has \"hypoglycemia\" which is a broad diagnosis without information then checking fasting sugars is justified, it may take a face to face appt with either the endo or general ped.",
