            "answer": "Hello Bear,I'm not a physician, but am a long-time Type 1 diabetic.I'm so sorry you're faced with this intestinal disease.\u00a0\u00a0Enteropathy is a generic term and so it might be that you have a form of gastroparesis (a form of diabetic neurpathy).To the extent that you can improve your diabetes management, strive to do so.\u00a0\u00a0Some neuropathy symptoms can be significantly eased when BGs are close to non-diabetic levels.\u00a0\u00a0Be patient, because I've also read that in the very short term some neuropathy symptoms initially feel worse (as circulation/sensation begins to return to feet, for example) before it eases up.I found an overview type of article at the JDRF website (http://www.jdrf.org -- click on RESEARCH ... type in nerve disease).\u00a0\u00a0Titles of several articles will pop up, including one called simply Nerve Disease.I also found some info from MedicineNet.com, tho' honestly I don't know how \"commercial\" the site is.\u00a0\u00a0It seems to have information consistent with what's on the JDRF site.\u00a0\u00a0It also has some info about particular meds, including Zellnorm.http://www.medicinenet.com/gastroparesis/article.htmProbably your doctor has tested you for food-intolerances that can also irritate our digestive tracts.\u00a0\u00a0If not, tho', as him/her about tests for Celiacs (gluten intolerance), which is not uncommon among DMers.Do you know anyone else with this condition?\u00a0\u00a0Might you like to talk with/email with others who have learned how to manage this complication?\u00a0\u00a0If so, I suggest JDRF again.\u00a0\u00a0Visit http://www.jdrf.org and clik on the link that sez something like \"New to Diabetes? You're not Alone\"\u00a0\u00a0This link will bring you to a much more \"private\" place where you can provide a bit of info so the volunteers there can find a volunteer in your area to work with you 1:1.\u00a0\u00a0Don't be concernd -- it's not \"just\" for newly diagnosed.\u00a0\u00a0The JDRF initiative is called the Online Diabetes Support Team and the volunteers there report that participants are relieved, grateful, and less stressed/more connected thru their participation.Good luck, Bear.\u00a0\u00a0Try to keep your spirits up.",

            "answer": "Dear sir,i'm sure you have seen the television commercials stating it is a drug only for irritable bowel syndrom with constipation with the women having various messages written with a marker on their stomachs. But other studies have shown it does work on males. i also have been taking it for a few months now. You can access more information on the drug by going to www.zelnorm.com. i take it because i have diabetic gastroparesis, which is cause by damage to the autonomic nerves controlling the stomach and intestines.i have found it very helpful in restoring normal movement in the whole gastric system. i hope you also find it to be helpful. i haven't noticed any side effects though if you occasionally get diareah (sp?) it can make that worse.good luck",

            "answer": "Dear bear12,Thank you so much for reaching out to the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. I am not a physician and cannot give you medical advice, however I am able to give you my personal experience dealing with my own son's type 1 complications with gastroparesis. I do have a few questions. Are you dealing with acid reflux or vomiting? I had not heard of the term \"enteropathy\" until today, but from my research it sounds like it is very similar to gastroparesis. This is a dismotility of the stomach. The stomach is unable to move food through the stomach at the normal pace. When I researched this it sounded very familiar.I know that Zelnorm has been prescribed for stomach problems, but I would also look into a doctor who specializes in type 1 diabetes and gastro problems. In my personal opinion, this is a very underdiagnosed problem. There are new drugs that help with nausea and other problems with the gut.I would like you to follow LRS's advice for a contact with JDRF's Online Diabetes Support Team. Please mention \"gastroparesis\". I am part of that team and would like to talk to you one on one.I promise if we do not connect I will be back to give you some resource links that may help.Best,dm",
