            "answer": "Hi Noelwolf,I am not a doctor, and certainly no little about the medical terminology but here's what I take away from this -the radiologist sees several small lesions (lesions=scars) in at least two areas of your brain.\u00a0\u00a0Everything else looks relatively normal (unremarkable). Of the possible diagnosises the radiologist suggests they look first at ischemic disease, or diseases like MS that present themselves with these types of lesions.I hope you go back to your neuro soon so you get the official interpretation and can move on through the diagnosis process to treatment, for whatever the final dx may be.my best,Lulu",

    "question": "Going through process of getting dx for MS, had spinal tap still waiting for results.Finding: There is no focal area of restrictive diffusion. There are muliple small focal ares of T2 prolongation throughout the subcortical and perventricualar white matter. No abnormal signal is demonstrated within the brainstem or corpus callosum. The ventricles and sulci are unremarkable without evidence of hydrocephalus, elevated intracranial pressure, significant focal mass effect or shift of the midline structures. The midline structures and craniocervical junctions are unremarkable. No abnormal intra or extra axial fluid collections are present. The internal carotid, verberal and basilar flow-voids are present.Impression: Muliple nonspecific small foci of white matter signal abnormality throughout both cerebral hemsipheres, Differental dignosis included qequelar of chronic mircroangiopathic ischemic disease ( no histroy of hpertension or diabetes) demyelinating process such as Multiple Scelerosis, vasculitis as well as additioanl less likely etiolgoies.",
