            "answer": "KristinaWow\u00a0\u00a06 years ago I was in the same boat.\u00a0\u00a0I had noticed those odd exact symptoms.After going to a few docs and first being told it might be MS I got even more freaked and finally went to the Cleveland Clinic.\u00a0\u00a0A world known neurologist looked at my MRI and listened to me explain symptoms and said this is not MSTo make a long story short I was sent to a physciatrist who I explained I honestly do not think this is anxiety and he insisted since I had a small infant and not good sleepWent on Celexa for 2 years and I was a much more calmer happier twitching numb with various odd skin sensations woman.\u00a0\u00a0I did stop the celexa and just lived with the symptoms because they I knew it was not MS and was like I can deal with it.\u00a0\u00a0It took another year and they faded.Its not 6 years later. I have a 2 yr old and about 6 mos ago guess what?\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms came back, burning face, tongue numbness and tingle joint pain and now hair loss, noticable loss.\u00a0\u00a0 I have been to 5 doctors in the past 3 months and finally back to the Cleveland Clinic dermatology.\u00a0\u00a0I am told that the on fire scalp that I have is probably due to Fibromyalgia and my next stop, a Rhumatologist.\u00a0\u00a0Had my hair not thinned out, I probably again would have learned to live with my symptoms. I know its not anxiety, sure of this.\u00a0\u00a0I think I have an inflamatory process going on within and that its just not showing up yet on the ANA testings, I hear it can take many years\u00a0\u00a0to manifest and show.\u00a0\u00a0Time will tell but try and rest and relax, eat well take vitamins and take breaks.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like your on the right track",

            "answer": "I feel like a broken record always saying the same thing to people but I as misdiagnosed and I think you both should have your liver evaluated and make sure nothing is going on in there. By that I mean have bloodwork done and a full hepatic panel done and be tested for hepatitis b and c viruses. Our livers are the filters of our body and responsible for many metabolic functions. Many of the symptoms you describe are symptoms of hepatitis c. I'd get tested if I were you. Hep c is very sneaky and you can show normal liver enzymes and it can be missed for many years. our joint pain complaints and the tingling really make me wonder as that happened to me too and docs acted like I was a nut case and of course blamed \"anxiety\" or \"stress\"Unforunately symptoms often can be attributed to any number of things so they aren't very helpful in trying to find out WHAT is causing them. It is not true that you have to have used drugs to have hep c either although everything you read about it says you do, it is a myth. 30% of the people who have it picked it up somewhere else. You can pick it up in places you wouldn't have thought of like manicure salons or from tattoos or even during a surgical procedure like I did or at the dentist. People who have it but are diagnosed incorrectly as having fibromyalgia are common. I'd test specifically for hep c and b to make sure you haven't picked it up along the line unknowingly.",

            "answer": "That is a good point I know HEp C can be devistating and its very seriousI don't have it I have had absolutely every single blood test in the world including a complete metabolic panel, kidneys, liver and that.\u00a0\u00a0YOu get pretty experienced after years of this stuff.I think the Auto-immune disorders are more common then we think.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes and Rhumatoid Arthritis are auto-immune.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that is my case but im waiting for the blood work to show it.",
