            "answer": "Thank you for your question. Although without being able to examine you I can not offer you the specific advice on diagnosis and treatment that you need, but I would try to provide you some relevant information about your health concern.From the symptoms you describe, it sounds that it could be a circulatory disturbance (due to compression of blood vessels) or a nerve pinched (due to fibrous scar) after the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0Symptoms may aggravate due to any clots in blood vessels, excessive alcohol use or diabetes. I would suggest evaluating all the possibilities with the help of a doctor first. Further referral to a neurologist will surely help you in getting a more precise opinion here. Hope this information proves help you.",

            "answer": "thanks for the informationadditional information about me: i don't drink alcohol, i can't because i take Lithium, have for 15 years. I've been tested for diabetes but i don't have it. They have looked at my brain,neck,jaw,spine,and done EMGs; all of these on sereval occassions. I've been tested for circulatory problems but also came out negative. The only thing they could come up with is that one of my the legs is shorter than the other, about 5mm. Doctor did not want to put a lift in because sarcum was .8 mm lower on one side. This is just bits and pieces of information dating for 5 years.note: i also take Lyrica for nerve pain, which doesn't work always.",

    "question": "5 years ago i had to go in for para-esophageal hiatal hernia surgery( hernia that causes your stomach to bulge upward). About 8 months later, I started having nerve pain in my arms, since then i've had problems in my upper body ( from the esophagus area up where it was fixed). The nerve pain is like a tingling/cold sensation; i've had every sort of medical test that you can think of but they show nothing significant. My D.O. said that people like me that have had the same surgery have problems similar to the ones i mentioned above. But he said he has no prove of it, do you know if this is true or not? answers would appreciated. Thank You!",
