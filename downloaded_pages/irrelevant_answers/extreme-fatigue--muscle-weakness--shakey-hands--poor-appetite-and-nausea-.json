            "answer": "If you think you might have MS have your PCP give you a neurological exam. If it is normal you do not have to worry about MS. It is checking reflexes and such. It is as accurate as a MRI. If it is abnormal you get a referral to a neurologist and they possibly do a MRI. It could be that you have several overlapping conditions with different symptoms.MS symptoms overlap with symptoms of many conditions. MS usually starts in the eyes.Alex",

            "answer": "Hi and welcome,I would strongly suggest you see your doctor, i genuinely doubt it has anything to do with a neurological condition like MS, because you have developed these issues directly after a medical procedure and resulting staff infection, that's a very coincidental time frame that can't be overlooked but keep in mind you do have a few preexisting medical issues and they are more likely involved with what you've been experiencing since the opp, more likely than a completely different type of medical condition like MS would be....The type 2 diabetes, waking up nauseated and a balloon feeling in your throat, high levels of fatigue, cognitive confusion, mental health issues, shakiness etc could be suggestive of something like sleep apnea, so please tell your doctor about everything that's going on and if he/she doesn't know enough to help, it would be worth considering getting the opinions from medical specialists familiar with the conditions you have been diagnosed with.Hope that helps.......JJ",

    "question": "I had a tummy tuck. And then developed a bad staph infection 2 weeks later . I was hospitalized for a week. I have CFS, Fibromyalgia and Adrenal Fatigue Syndrome. When I got home from the hospital I was so exhausted and fatigued all the time that I stopped taking 3 night meds cold turkey. Restoril, Topomax, and Tinazadine. now 3 weeks later I have had bad shakes, muscle weakness and fatigue that is ridiculous. I awake nauseated feeling like I have a balloon in my throat. It is a effort to eat.\u00a0\u00a0The tummy tuck was a success as far as I know. No other problems than the infection.But it is crazy that I feel like someone stuck a straw in me and sucked all the life out of me this far after. My surgery was Sept 2, 2016. I am scared. Most say I look like I have Parkinsons because I shake so bad. Is this withdrawal? A bad CFS flare? Did the surgery activate a disease such as Parkinsons, MS or who knows.\u00a0\u00a0I keep hoping this will pass but so far it has not. I also was upped my Zoloft at this time from 50mg to 100 mg. I have read that antidepressants can have adverse results. And I have early stage type 2 diabetes. My numbers have not been over 200 when I have checked they are staying pretty good. I have also read that diabetes 2 can really mess with you.Every day about 4pm my mind seems to fizzle. I get bad brain fog and have a hard time with finding words or remembering something. Does anyone have any ideas , suggestions or similar stories they can share. I would be very full of gratitude and appreciation.I want my life back as I knew it. Just need a clue where to begin.",
