            "answer": "if his heart had stopped more than a few minutes then brain cells start to die because of lack of oxygen, he should come round but it will take longer for sedatives to wear off because his kidneys cannot filter the blood properly, is he on a transplant list for a kidney and have the doctors mentioned kidney failure will lead to heart failure, this may be connected",

            "answer": "Why does he keep pulling out his lines to his dialysis.\u00a0\u00a0He is not awake and still is not responding because he keeps doing this and they have to wait and start all over for the dialysis.He had a quadruple bypass about 3 years ago and had type two diabetes and was doing better with the diabetes before the heart surgery, but after the heart surgery the diabetes got worse and he was taking insulin.\u00a0\u00a0Hasn't been able to get the sugars under control, but he sneeks things that he shouldn't.His leggs have been bothering him too the past year.\u00a0\u00a0Pain and weakness and burning and stinging.\u00a0\u00a0He said that it was excruciating (sp).He is my father in law, but he is the only father I ever had and I am not dealing well with this.My Mother died in 99 due to cancer (cervical, lung and brain).\u00a0\u00a0I wasn't there for her, my brother was.\u00a0\u00a0I was in Idaho soo far away with no money to get to Michigan except when a friend bought me a plane ticket and I got to see her a month before she passed.I hadn't seen her for 16 years before that.\u00a0\u00a0It made me feel aweful, but at least I was able to see her before she passed on and we could heal our wounds.I wrote her a poem when she passed.Every morning when I wake, I wonder what the day will hold.Will I be able to make it through, or will the hurt inside unfold?I try to understand why GOD has taken Mom away.I know he has his reasons, so each night I sit and pray.I pray that Mom's not far away and watches over me at night,And through the day she'll hold my hand and let me know that it's alright.She wouldn't want me to be sad, because she's in a better place.For her spirit will always be around, when I need a warm embrace.By Me",

The IV drip we called \"Liquid Gold\" at the time.\u00a0\u00a0The last thing we talked about was why I hadn't visited him enough.\u00a0\u00a0He was right!\u00a0\u00a0He lived 3 hours away and my life was so busy and hectic.\u00a0\u00a0Only 3 hours away I say now.\u00a0\u00a0Only 3 hours.\u00a0\u00a0A very strange thing happened when he passed.\u00a0\u00a0It was Valentine's Day and I had card I was going to give him that day.\u00a0\u00a0The phone rang at 4:30am and it was my step mom calling to say he was gone.\u00a0\u00a0I left the card in my luggage at the hotel and went to the hospital to help make the arrangements.\u00a0\u00a0When I returned home the next day, I unpacked my bags and was NEVER able to find that card!\u00a0\u00a0I like to think he took it with him.My mom was a diabetic and she suffered emmensely.\u00a0\u00a0She eventually lost one of her legs to this.\u00a0\u00a0She would develope sores that were holes in her feet.As for the pulling out of the lines, he is just not himself right now. Is he responsive at all?\u00a0\u00a0I know it is difficult, but you hang in there.\u00a0\u00a0Lean on the One Whose Arms can carry us.I am usually here if you just want to vent.\u00a0\u00a0Take care.\u00a0\u00a0I am lifting you up in prayer again today!\u00a0\u00a0Ally",
