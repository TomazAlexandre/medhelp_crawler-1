            "answer": "Hi there!Prognosis in a stroke would depend on the type of stroke (better for ischaemic strokes), area/ vessel involved, recovery in the first 24-48 hours etc. There is no danger of death unless factors precipitating haemorrhage have not been controlled or there are subsequent similar episodes. It would be best to discuss the management plan and the expected prognosis in detail with his treating neurologist.Hope this is helpful.Take care!",
