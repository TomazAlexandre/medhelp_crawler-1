            "answer": "It's called\u00a0\u00a0formication.\u00a0\u00a0It's a neurological condition that makes people think bugs are crawling around under their skin.\u00a0\u00a0But they aren't, it's a neurological condition.\u00a0\u00a0Like untreated diabetes or kidney disease can cause itchy prickliness,\u00a0\u00a0I think there will be a physiological diagnosis for what causes the sensation of bugs crawling under the skin.\u00a0\u00a0I don't think it will be actual teeny little bugs that can't be seen in testing.But the sensation is still very real,\u00a0\u00a0and not imagined.\u00a0\u00a0Like people in the hospital given Morphine,\u00a0\u00a0who feel their faces itch terribly.\u00a0\u00a0It's physiological,\u00a0\u00a0but there's nothing wrong with the skin on their face.Best wishes.\u00a0\u00a0The suggestions in this link are good.\u00a0\u00a0Lyme disease?\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes?\u00a0\u00a0etc.I hope you are able to get answers.\u00a0\u00a0That sounds miserable.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formication",

            "answer": "Hello,These symptoms can be due to parasthesia skin. Parasthesias are common in alcoholics and metabolic disorders like diabetes, hypothyroidism, and hypoparathyroidism. They can also be due to peripheral vascular disease, vitamin B12 deficiency or malnutrition.Get your blood sugar and thyroid hormones levels evaluated. You can take some vit B12 for some days and see if the tingling is gone or not.In case the symptoms persist then consult a neurologist as it can be due to some neurological disorder.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
