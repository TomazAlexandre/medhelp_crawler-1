This summer was my daughters third year. Each year she says she des not want to go back and each time she has a great time and does not want it to end.\u00a0\u00a0It is the 2 weeks a year that she is \" normal",

            "answer": "I have to agree with Diabetic_Reality. I've been diabetic since the age of 7. I'm now 47. I went to summer camp when I was 9, and still have terrible thoughts of the experience. Nothing was as I expected, and I'd been a Girl Scout and family camper all my life. My sister, who also is diabetic (28 years), on the other hand works with a camp in Missouri, and thinks it's the greatest thing she's ever done as an adult. It definitely depends on the person.I do agree with the concept behind going to camp - it's important to know there are others out there who are just like you, or even may have things worse than you do. I always enjoyed reading about others my age who had diabetes.I think the hardest thing for me growing up, and still as an adult, was the feeling of not being \"normal.\" I don't think that will ever change, but maybe you can help your child accept that it's okay to be different in some ways. It makes him unique. I've reached a point where I'm proud that I've made it 40 years with this additional baggage, because alot of kids didn't. We'll be celebrating this fact with a huge party this fall, and I'm hoping to invite many of the doctors who treated me over the years - including, if he's still alive, the one who told my parents to enjoy me while they could, I'd probably not live to graduate from high school. No wonder I've suffered from depression all these years!I have a whole lot more to say on the topic, but to me the most important thing is to let your child know that having diabetes sucks, but the rest of his life doesn't have to change. He can still do the things he's always done, he just has to think it through a little more carefully than his friends or siblings. Treat him as normally as you would treat him if he didn't have the disease. Don't make him any more different than he already is - let him have the occasional treat, just know there has to be a compensation somewhere else. It's all a balancing act.And, talk to his doctor. There are some super medications out there for depression. They treat kids all the time. Sometimes, someone outside your normal sphere but sympathetic to talk to like a counselor is all that's necessary, but make sure it's someone who at least understands what your son is going through, not someone who's a stiff upper lip type.Good luck. I hope you're able to celebrate his 40th anniversary with the knowledge he made it through to a cure.",

            "answer": "Keep in mind one thing though .... depending upon the person's personality, camp or support groups may have the opposite effect as well and you need a trained professional.\u00a0\u00a0For me - it made me feel worse.\u00a0\u00a0Not because of the people - but seeing how many of us there actually were and realizing that this was only a teeny-tiny subset of the larger diabetic population that grows by the thousands each year.\u00a0\u00a0And that there is no viable \"fix\" available yet to make us normal again. (Let's face it, it's nice to hear about research but unless it's a procedure that can be put to use now - it's still just a hope and a prayer and not much else to us.) I don't think I'm the only one who has attended such things as a participant (not a parent or caregiver) and even though there were a couple hundred of us in a crowd .... you still felt alone.",

            "answer": "Diabetic_Reality,As a mother of a son with diabetes, 27, diagnosed at 8, I have also heard from my son that no matter what, he did feel alone and has been skeptical about the research for a cure. Research is moving. Please don't give up on this. I, myself have a disability from arthritis and try with all of my heart to put a positive approach out there. It is by no means easy, but can be done. I have also learned that 80% of people dealing with chronic illness are also very likely dealing with depression. Donnell is correct regarding meds that can help with a physician who understands diabetes and depression.I would encourage any parents to understand type 1, but to encourage their sons or daughters to follow their passions. My son fought forest fires in Montana and Idaho with great success and is a Medic for the Pro-patrol for winter skiing, including search and rescue. He was originally told that he could not do this.Surprise!He has been encouraged by his abilities rather then his percieved disability. It can be a difficult trial and I understand the downside of all that anyone with type 1 is going through, but know that we are doing our best to find that cure!dm",

    "question": "I just read a letter from \"Josephsmother\" dated about Jan. 24 2004. In this letter she asked about depression and diabetes, and listed several symptoms of depression that her son was experiencing. Among the symptoms was Self Loathing. Having been diagnosed Type 1 fourtyseven years ago at 5 yrs. of age, I can relate to the self loathing, feeling embarrased, andgenerally \"different than\". I appear here not with a question, but a suggestion based on experience. I know that the time I spent at summer camp in Southern Calif. in the '60's with other diabetic children was a life saver for me. To see that there were others my age with the same disease who were just as happy, joyous and free as any child was an inspiration and a turning point in my life. Today I am still in contact with at least one of my camping buddies. I heartily recommend that any child who is diabetic be given the opportunity to attend a camp for diabetic children.\u00a0\u00a0It could just make the difference.God Bless y'all",
