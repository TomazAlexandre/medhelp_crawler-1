            "answer": "Yeah my first appt (10 weeks) was a pap, and got to listen to the heart beat and went over family history, did my vitals, blood work, and a urine sample. Second one (14 weeks) was a urine sample, listen to the heart beat and my vitals, did a blood test to check for birth defects and got the option to find out the sex. 3rd appt (18 weeks) did the urine sample listened to the heartbeat and vitals and got measured for the first time. Then had and ultrasound at 20 weeks, then 22 weeks did a urine sample got measured and listened to the heart beat. And now at my next appt I'll get tested for gestational diabetes, and then the regular urine sample vitals heartbeat and measurement and more blood work lol they get pretty routine.",
