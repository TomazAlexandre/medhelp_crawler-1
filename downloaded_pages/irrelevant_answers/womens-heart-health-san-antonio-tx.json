            "answer": "Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my question.\u00a0\u00a0It is too bad that there isn't a site that doesn't recomment doctors, but attaches recommendations or reviews about them so new patients can\u00a0\u00a0make up their mind.I can't afford to visit a doctor only to find out she cannot help me.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that many doctors I've seen recently either look at their computer screen or my records.I can bring a list of questions to ask the doctor, but have actually been told \"we don't need that list\".\u00a0\u00a0Or, I get nervous after one question because the doctor is getting impatient, and I just quit asking.I need a good doctor, who cares.\u00a0\u00a0That is the most important to me, CARE FOR YOUR PATIENT.\u00a0\u00a0Don't belittle them, look them in the eye, tell them what is wrong as shown on blood tests, ask them questions and don't be insulted if a patient knows more about medicine than the average person.\u00a0\u00a0Some people are more familiar with medicine and the terminology than others.My former doctor gave me my test results five months after she took them.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH was .1, my thyroid peroxidase was elevated, ANA elevated, my hemoglobin A1C was elevated (which is odd because my kidneys do not produce enough EPO and when I could afford it I was receiving injections of EPO) and I was positive for H Pylori IgG.\u00a0\u00a0She did tell me I was H Pylori positive and I had an endoscopy.\u00a0\u00a0I just finished paying for that, but I won't get the results/meds until I can make the co-pay to see the specialist.\u00a0\u00a0Six\u00a0\u00a0months so far.The last day I saw this doctor, she said to her computer (didn't bother to look at me) that I either was diabetic or was pre-diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0I am underweight, have fybromyalgia, CFD, hypertension, something wrong with my thyroid.I'be been treated for hypothyroid for about 20 years.\u00a0\u00a0Earlier this year I saw an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0I mentioned the nodules on the right side of my thyroid.\u00a0\u00a0He couldn't feel them until I took his hand and showed him where they were.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't worried.\u00a0\u00a0He wasn't worried that my test indicated pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0The cover sheet on the test results said my diabetes 'scores' were fine.\u00a0\u00a0No they weren't.\u00a0\u00a0All one had to do was turn over the cover page and look at the results--pre-diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0On the\u00a0\u00a0line between diabetes and pre-diabetes.I'll quit now.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have much faith in most of the doctors I've seen.\u00a0\u00a0The fact that I cannot be told the results of my upper GI, and receive prescriptions until I pay the specialist turns my stomach.\u00a0\u00a0This is not the first time it has happened either.I realize there are sites on the web that 'score' doctors, but one has to be so careful about what is said and who said it.\u00a0\u00a0I have several other problems including thoracic surgery (to prevent paralysis) gone wrong after a fall and all the problems inherent in falling a week after surgery.I am going to see Dr Sanjana this Thursday and I am nervous.\u00a0\u00a0He wrote a very comprehensive statement about his goals when treating his patients.\u00a0\u00a0My daughter has seen him and liked him, but didn't like the front office people who were rude and unkind.Thank you once again for answering my question.\u00a0\u00a0It is ironic that no one bothered to answer my question but a kind doctor from India.Sincerely,Maureen Martinek",

            "answer": "Hi Maureen : I saw your post and I would like to recommend my cardiologist. Her name is Dr Meeney Dhir and her office is at Sonterra Cardiovascular Institute @ 1314 E. Sonterra Blvd. Ste. 102 __ph 210-496-0300.Across from Stone Oak Methodist Hospital\u00a0\u00a0 For years I had heart attack symptoms and many trips to the ER but all my ekgs were always normal and the male doctors could never find anything wrong. Then one day was having a bad episode and a coworker said why don't you call my cardiologist\u00a0\u00a0wife, they are a husband /wife team. He specializes in stints etc and she specializes in women's hearts. Although my tests were normal she still saw some thing wrong ,she diagnosed me with a condition known as Myocardial Bridge which gives out all symptoms of a heart attack. A condition I was born with. She says men's and women's heart are totally different. I'm sure there are very good male cardiologists but they couldn't hep me. I called her on a Fri. And she called me Sat herself and made all appts. for me. Give her a call\u00a0\u00a0hope this helps. Mary Tovar",
