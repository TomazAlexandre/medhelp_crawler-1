            "answer": "Hello,Excessive sweating (Hyperhidrosis) can occur either due to genetic reason or secondary to physiological or disease conditions such as excessive intake of certain foods, caffeine, drugs, nicotine, anxiety, excessively functioning thyroid or pituitary gland, gout, diabetes, menopausal state, neurological causes, certain drugs, certain tumors, etc to name a few more common ones. A bacterial or fungal infection of the skin or its components (sweat glands, sebaceous glands etc) or an obstruction of such glands can result in foul-smell of the sweat too.A good hygiene, balanced diet, use of local or systemic antibiotic/antifungal medication, and opinions with a Physician, a Dermatologist & a Nutritionist would clear your condition and help manage it more efficiently.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your dermatologist. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
