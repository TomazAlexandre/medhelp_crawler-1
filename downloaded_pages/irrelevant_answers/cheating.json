            "answer": "Hey Sleeping Beauty!\u00a0\u00a0Well, you said it yourself...you have to be true to yourself.\u00a0\u00a0That's the bottom line isn't it? We all have our weaknesses and chocolate seems to be a very popular one with, not just diabetics, but everyone!\u00a0\u00a0You need to keep in mind that those out of ideal range blood sugars can cause damage if prolonged over time.\u00a0\u00a0Sounds like you're aware of this already, but I want to state that for those who are new to diabetes and may not realize this.\u00a0\u00a0Now, with having said that, let me share with everyone my favorite \"healthy\" chocolate fix recipe.\u00a0\u00a0I got this from a weight watchers meeting and it has saved me from making a poor food choice many a time (though the best way to avoid the poor food choices is to not have them in the house).\u00a0\u00a0Mix together in a large bowl (this receipe may overflow, so make sure the bowl is large) 1/2 cup of oatmeal, 2 packets of sugar free/fat free hot chocolate and 1 cup of water.\u00a0\u00a0Microwave on high for approx. 1 1/2 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0Stir & enjoy!\u00a0\u00a0It's really good when served with a dollop of fat free or lite cool whip!\u00a0\u00a0Try it, enjoy it and afterwards you don't have to feel guilty!\u00a0\u00a0We all have to eat, and if we substitute healthy alternatives to the high sugar/high fat foods, we can enjoy them guiltfree too!\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck!",

    "question": "Hi guys, hope this message greets all of you in the best of diabetic health ! :)So, I just wanna ask some people who can relate to me a little...do you ever cheat on your blood sugar sometimes...like once in a month and have a chocolate bar...or...a sweet chocolate drink ?I am 20 and type 2.and honestly, I have to be true to myself ! And the truth is...once a month or so...I crave a little chocolate. Last night I indulged in a chocolate bar and a chocolate drink too. Woke up with my BS at 155, as expected. I feel guilty afterwards...but then I if I exercise I wont.During the week Im in just tight control......then comes the weekends..and sometimes I cheat :(Insight anyone ?",
