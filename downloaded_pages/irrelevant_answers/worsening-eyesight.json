            "answer": "You might also want to have your blood sugar levels checked. You can do this yourself. High blood sugars can effect your distance sight. You can buy a meter and test strips at any pharmacy. Read the directions. Check your blood about an hour after you eat a meal. Anything over a 140 reading can be a sign of an issue. Normal levels are around 80 to 120. If your blood sugar levels are consistently over 140, GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR. If you measure your blood sugars and they are over 200, 300, 400 or higher, GO SEE YOUR DOCTOR REAL SOON.",

            "answer": "I went to the ophthalmologist and she did an eye exam and checked my nerves and things like that. It is not both eyes that are affected. Just the right eye which is the side of my body that was affected by the stroke. She tested me and said my vision was still 20/20 in my right eye but when I did a test for my visual field there was an area that I was seeing nothing in on my right eye.\u00a0\u00a0One of my friends also mentioned blood sugar so I am going to look into that as diabetes and the such does run in my family.",

            "answer": "If your issues are in JUST one eye, it's unlikely due to high blood sugar and more likely another issue. Perhaps it's time for you to visit your neurologist again.

    "question": "I had my stroke eight months ago when I was 22 due to an unnoticed PFO that was the size of a quarter. Due to the stroke, I had lesions on the left and right side of my thalamus. I have recovered physically for the most part, still a little weakness in my right side, but recently my eyesight has been faltering. It happened very suddenly overnight and now I have a hard time seeing people at a distance. Can your eyesight be affected by a stroke eight months after the stroke has happened?",
