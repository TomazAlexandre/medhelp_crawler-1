            "answer": "From the symptoms you're experiencing, you should definitely be tested.Get tested and soon!One of the effects of diabetes is that the pressure within the eyeball itself varies with your control of blood sugar and the eyeball becomes temporarily \"deformed\". As it either elongates (high pressure) or contracts (Reduced pressure), the distance from the lens to the back of the eye changes - thereby changing the focal point and varying the image the brain receives from the optic nerve.Along with the need for urination, are you also experiencing thirst? As the blood sugar builds up, the blood dumps it off to the bladder to flush it from the body - higher sugar volume equals more frequent urination. Because you're dumping off fluids, the body needs to replenish them which equals thirst. Did yourAre you losing weight, seem to be tired and without much energy and is your tongue coated and whitish? Because insulin is the key that allows the sugar to enter the cells and be burned, without it the body starts breaking down fat to burn.(Weight loss) Since the body can't break down fat fast enough to compensate for the non-available sugar, you feel tired and listless.A byproduct of the fat breakdown is a gas that cooks out through the tongue - the gas turns it white and gives you what's referred to as \"fruit-breath\". (Coated tongue)I had all these symptoms and wound up being hospitalized simply because I kept putting off being tested even though I knew somethng was definitely wrong. Dumb! The Dr said that he'd have seen me one way or the other - I'd have either walked in as I did or they'd have brought me in by ambulance! It took them a day just to get my blood sugars lowered to within a readable range.Don't delay - get some help from a professsional. If you know a diabetic and he/she is well maintained and happy with their Dr., use that one.Good Luck. Remember, it's a manageable condition that you get to manage yourself. I live a normal life and it's been 38 years since I was first treated. I'm now 67 and retired and I remain just as active in all the same things that I did before.",

            "answer": "I started a sentence and didn't finish it - Did your eye doctor test for glaucoma? That could show increased pressure in the eyeball and if he's astute enough it would indicate to him that it might be diabetes related.By the way, my Dr. told me early on that under no circumstances should I use contacts because the shape of the eyeball changes depending on\u00a0\u00a0the control and the fit of the contact lens fit against the eyeball will be off. besides varying the focus, this can also cause chafing and iritation.Again, good luck!",
