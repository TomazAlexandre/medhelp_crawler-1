            "answer": "Schizophrenia is a chemical imbalance in your brain. You seem to be experiencing some of the positive symptoms of this illness. If you are thinking that people are reading your mind it is called a delusion and if you are hearing things that other people don't hear, it is a hallucination. There is a lot of stigma about this illness in the world but it is another treatable illness just like diabetes or emphysema. Talk to your doctor and ask him about schizophrenia. You won't regret it.",

            "answer": "You could have depression with psychotic features or schizoaffective disorder. I have schizoaffective disorder and the mood disorder aspect is bipolar. I am recovered now with an antipsychotic in Phase II FDA study glycine as I've said on other posts but I know what the experience is like. But there are other forms of schizoaffective disorder that have depression instead of bipolar as the mood phase. And if you have suicidal urges you need to see a psychiatrist right away. Depression with psychotic features is when a person has psychotic thoughts only during mood fluctuations. With schizoaffective disorder psychotic thoughts or auditory hallucinations (hearing voices) can occur at any time. But as to how to look at it I'd say look at it as I do, I am a person with a psychiatric disability and I need treatment as part of my recovery. See it as a positive step up in life and keep going from there.",

            "answer": "ABSOLUTELY talk to your Dr. My son is 19 and schizophrenic. He has hallucinations that are faces and\u00a0\u00a0\"they\" put thoughts / ideas in his head to do things.\u00a0\u00a0This has led to very bad anxiety and paranoia.He is also suicidal . We are working with his Dr. to find the right mix of meds to help him. The sooner you get the right\u00a0\u00a0meds\u00a0\u00a0the better the chance of getting things under control and maybe even keep them from getting worse or harder to manage. PLEASE DON'T WAIT. You don't want to end up in the hospital on the psych floor (like my son has 4 times in 09)Make sure you have a good support system , a parent , relative , good friend ,someone you can confide in and help you thru this\u00a0\u00a0Take Care",

    "question": "Over the past year I have developed the belief that people can read my mind and that I\u2019m thinking things that aren\u2019t my thoughts. I am 17 and I have never taken drugs, don\u2019t drink or even smoke. I\u2019ve been diagnosed with depression and anxiety a couple of weeks back and I wanted to know if this is a symptom, or if I should be more worried about it. Its not that bad but often coincides with suicidal urges. Should I tell my doctor?",
