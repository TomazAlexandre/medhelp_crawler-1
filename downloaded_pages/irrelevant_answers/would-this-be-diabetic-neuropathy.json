            "answer": "\"How common or uncommon is diabetic neuropathy in a persons side?\"\"Rather than being all over the place I am averaging 140s-150s\"If this is fasting you are high. If it is 2-3 hours after eating you're a tad over where <141 mg/dl is the goal and <121 mg/dl optimum. Congrats on getting your glucose managed and controlled. That's an attaboy.Diabetic neuropathies are a family of nerve disorders caused by diabetes. People with diabetes can, over time, develop nerve damage throughout the body. Some people with nerve damage have no symptoms. Others may have symptoms such as pain, tingling, or numbness\u2014loss of feeling\u2014in the hands, arms, feet, and legs. Nerve problems can occur in every organ system, including the digestive tract, heart, and sex organs.Have you spoken with an Gastroenterologist? Your pain could be triggered by a number of things like ulcers, gerd, and so on. Have he/she look into \"splenic flexure syndrome\" also, which is basically gas getting trapped in the portion of the colon that loops around under your spleen causing pain under the left rib cage. My brother in-law had this and ran the merry-go-round as you are now.",

When I meet with my doctor in about a week and a half I will get a referral to a Gastroenterologist.I didn't really consider any gastro issues because early on my doctor prescribed prilosec and I have been taking it daily since.",

    "question": "Let me start with a little history.I am your average 37yo white male. No major health issues until the following began. Sedentary lifestyle, poor diet, the same old story.In early August 2010 I started having pains along my left side, at about the bottom of my rib cage. The pain can be best described as being stabbed with a blunt object in either the front or the back, about 3-4 inches off center and having that pain shoot horizontally stopping at the same point on the reverse side. The pain will happen randomly. It is not muscular as I have full movement without any change in pain. It is not painful to the touch, at times the surface appears to be partially numb. There were no injuries or physical exertions that caused the pain. There is nothing visible indicating any issues, no rashes or sores. The pain level varies from a 2 at its lowest and peaking at an 8, at times making me almost double over when it spikes.After about a week of dealing with it and trying to control the pain with ibuprofen and acetaminophen, I went to the local immediate care department. The doctor did a basic exam, ordered some blood tests and prescribed what he called a prescription strength acetaminophen (I cannot remember the name, but it was not a narcotic). He didn't give me any definitive diagnosis but seemed to think it may be shingles, though there was no rash or sores and it was not painful to the touch or pressure. After about a week the pain still had not subsided and the prescription medication seemed to be making the pain worse, I went back to the immediate care department. Another doctor did a basic exam, looked over the test results the last doctor had done. He did not see any issues and ordered urine tests. He also suggested it was shingles. A couple of days later I got a call with test results, nothing out of the ordinary. It was recommended I see a doctor in Internal Medicine.I made an appointment with an Internist, which was well over a month out. With the pain driving me bonkers I called and was able to get in to see a P.A. within a couple of days. After answering the same questions and going through a little more thorough exam she gave me the tentative diagnosis of a pinched nerve. She prescribed the steroid Medrol and Lortab for the pain. These finally helped with the pain.A couple of weeks later I met with the Internist. He asked the same questions and did the same basic exam. He also talked about it maybe being shingles, still with no rash or pain to the touch. He ordered some more blood tests and sent me on my way with a follow up appointment in a month. He prescribed Prilosec for the possibility it was a stomach issue and gabapentin if it was nerve related pain. I also get a prescription for chantix so I can start the process of quitting smoking. By this point I had finished the medrol and lortab.A week or so later I received a letter in the mail with my test results. They indicated both my blood glucose and cholesterol were high. He had ordered an OGTT test and I was to have it completed before my next appointment. I got the OGTT test and at my next appointment he told me I have diabetes. The OGTT numbers were fasting of 225 and two hours later 350. My A1C was 9. This was a big surprise to me as I have never had any symptoms of diabetes. None of the other tests indicated any issues that could be causing the pain. He ordered an MRI of my thoracic spine. He prescribes metformin and I schedule a meeting with a diabetes educator.Got the MRI done, the very next day I got a call from the Internist's nurse saying I had a herniated disk. I was referred for physical therapy and to see a neurosurgeon. I made the appointments.I started having shooting pains down my left arm and leg. Tried to get in to see my doctor, but he was unavailable in a reasonable time, so saw another internist. He ordered more MRIs, this time on my lumbar and cervical spine. He also ordered cymbalta for the nerve pain (or maybe he thought I was crazy).A couple of weeks later I had my first PT appointment. For some reason the physical therapist did not have any information on why I was referred to him. I just told him exactly what I knew, I have this pain and the nurse said I have a herniated disk. He started me with some core exercises. Soon after I saw the neurosurgeon. He told me the herniated disk is at T3, which is way too high to be causing the pain I am having.A few weeks later I see the Internist. We discuss the neurosurgeon's report. He asks how the pain is doing and I explain there is little to no change. The prilosec works well for heartburn, which I have had regularly for years. The gabapentin seems to cut the edge off the pain, but I still feel the spikes. The cymbalta seems to be doing nothing, the pain along my arm and leg are gone, and it was expensive so I wanted to not refill it. He prescribes LidoDerm patches. I tell him, managing the pain is good, but what is the next step in figuring out what the cause is. He refers me to neurology for an EMG(?) or nerve induction study.Now here I am. My BG is starting to get under control. Rather than being all over the place I am averaging 140s-150s. Not perfect, but getting there. The pain is just a prevalent.I meet with the diabetes educator next week and my doctor the week after. I have been pretty passive so far but I think its time I took control and got some answers.How common or uncommon is diabetic neuropathy in a persons side?How long does diabetic neuropathy on average last?Any other insights you may have would be greatly appreciated. I want to go into the appointments with as much information as I can.",
