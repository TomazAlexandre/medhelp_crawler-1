            "answer": "Your feelings are not at all unusual. I think most type 1's, including myself, have suffered such depression many times. Sometimes to such a great degree that our control and health suffers, along with our self esteem and social life. Please do seek out counseling, a psychologist familiar with the issues of dealing with chronic illness if possible. I know it can be expensive, but for me it has made the difference between being defeated by complications and other issues, and regaining my strength to go on and live a mostly normal and fulfilling life.",
