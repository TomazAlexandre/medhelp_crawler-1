            "answer": "Hello Minnie,With so much diabetes in your family, you are wise to be on the lookout.Many folks look to the fasting BG (blood glucose) reading as the indicator for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0In recent years, however, there's an interest in doing what's called a 2-hour post-prandial (after eating) blood test, since those are often affected sooner than one's fasting test.If any of your diabetic family members live close enuf, perhaps you can test 2 hours after a meal with them.A more traditional test would be a full Glucose Tolerance test (done by a doc or at a lab) where they'll stress your system.A fasting BG of above 126 is usually considered a diabetic reading.\u00a0\u00a0Between 110-125 is a caution range often called \"pre-diabetes.\"\u00a0\u00a0At this level, you are wise to begin discussing diet, exercise and other strategies to delay/avoid the onset.Do talk with your doctor about a referral to an endocrinologist.\u00a0\u00a0They are \"up\" on these issues much more than most general practitioners.",

            "answer": "I am not able to diagnosis the symptoms that you've posted on this forum as I am not a medial professional, but I am able to discuss this issue with you as a mom of a diabetic child for the last 13 years.I would recommend that you seek the advice of a physician that specializes in diabetes so that the symptoms that you are experiencing can be evaluated.\u00a0\u00a0One very important tool in managing diabetes is the hemoglobin A1C blood test.\u00a0\u00a0This test is run every 3-4 months and it measures the average blood sugar over this time period.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you.",

            "answer": "Your question concerned me because the symptoms that you say you are experiencing and that you were told to watch out for in diabetic family members because they are symptoms of neuropathy are NOT symptoms of diabetic onset. When a person first develops diabetes, the symptoms usually are excessive thirst, inordinate hunger, wieght loss in spite of eating more than usual, frequent urination because of the large amounts of water being consumed, and fatigue. Tingling, numbness and weakness all over may be some symptoms of nerve damage from long-term diabetic damage, but not of early onset of the disease. Please see your physician immediately to take a look at these symptoms. While I agree that you are wise to take a look at diabetes because of the family history, your symptoms don't seem to point to diabetes (especially with your very normal fglucose range), but to something else. These symptoms could be symptoms of other serious health conditions and need to be evaluated.",

            "answer": "Thank you to everyone.When my daughter was diagnosed with Diabetes it was I that diagnosed her.She displayed the symptoms of constant thirst, going to the bathroom quite often and was always hungry.Her OB/GYN DID NOT HAVE A CLUE! Her Internist never ran a glucose test.\u00a0\u00a0He upped her Thyroid Pills.I went to the drug store and bought a kit and it was positive.Her glucose reading was over 300.\u00a0\u00a0When my sister was diagnosed it was 500. Other members in our family are stable and doing well.Maternal Grandmother lived to be 85 with this disease and Paternal Granfather lived to 83.\u00a0\u00a0Both were insulin dependent and lived rather well.I pray that my daughter, sister, cousin, aunt and uncle all live to that age.\u00a0\u00a0My Mother and Dad did not have diabetes.I worry about my other child and grandchildren.I am being followed now by a Spinal Doc and am waiting for MRI results for possibly a herniated ruptured disk.\u00a0\u00a0More recent blood work is normal except for the Sed Rate which is somewhat elevated.I am not suppose to be on the computer (-:,\u00a0\u00a0the doctor said, as Neck is in a brace but wanted to Thank You all again.",

These were NON fasting tests.
