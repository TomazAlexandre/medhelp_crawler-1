            "answer": "Poli,So sorry to read about your sister's troubles.\u00a0\u00a0It is not uncommon for folks with chronic illnesses to also slip into depression, for exactly the reasons you mention.While none of us here are physicians, I encourage you continue to \"be there\" to listen and encourage your sister thru all this.\u00a0\u00a0In addition, since depression is a serious medical condition that can often be treated, see if you can encourage her to seek treatment for that.\u00a0\u00a0With a combination of therapy, meds, and strong family support, she may well learn how to cope with the enormous health burdens she's living with.You and others in the family might benefit from some good counseling as well -- and you might find that in the medical community or in your church/temple, where there are folks with both skill & compassion to help us thru life's rough spots.On the emotional side, I think that Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes are very similar.\u00a0\u00a0Both come along with complications or risks of them, and with psychological & emotional pressures, worries, feeling guilty, feeling angry, feeling despair.\u00a0\u00a0Folks with either type of diabetes can also enjoy all the good emotions: hope, contentment, happiness, love, compassion.",

This is a difficult age to have to deal with a chronic illness.\u00a0\u00a0Along with posting questions at this website, I would like to suggest your family checks out www.jdrf.org\u00a0\u00a0and go to the JDRF Kids online section . . . there is always lots of great information there.\u00a0\u00a0Also, www.childrenwithdiabetes.com\u00a0\u00a0 is another great site complete with chat rooms for parents and teens and much, much more!Please come back and let us know how both your sister and grand daughter are doing . . . all the best!\u00a0\u00a0JHG",
