            "answer": "Hi jmz,First I want to welcome you to the Pain Management Forum and let you know that we are glad you found this Forum. I want to let you know that there are NO Doctors on this Forum only CP - Chronic Pain - Patients that help each other with our OWN expertise and experiences that we have developed through our OWN CP Issues.I'm VERY sorry that you are not getting very good results with the meds that you are on!! It's so very difficult to be able to get the pain relief that we need sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0The ONE thing you MUST remember is that NO ONE on here is a Doctor!!I went back and read your other post from a year ago and see that you have some VERY serious health problems with your Diabetes. That's something that I know a LOT about as I lost my beloved Husband to that disease more than 14 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0With your diabetes background you DEFINITELY need to talk with your Doctor about the changes in your pain meds.\u00a0\u00a0He/She will have to be the one to make the decision about ANY changes to your medications as it could SERIOUSLY effect your health ESPECIALLY if you have ANY additional health problems that your diabetes may have caused to your body.PLEASE go to your Doctor and discuss this with them and HOPEFULLY, he/she can find something that will be SAFE for you to take without jeopardizing your health in any way.I wish you the VERY best and HOPE you will call your Doctor soon so that you can get your meds straightened out. :)Can you give your Doctor a call on Monday and talk with him/her?\u00a0\u00a0If you need to make an appointment to see him/her then DO IT!!Wishing you the VERY best and I HOPE your Doctor can get you on the meds that you need to help your pain.Good Luck............Sherry",

            "answer": "Hi John Mike...Welcome again to MedHelp's Pain Management Forum. I am sorry to hear that your current opiate therapy is not sufficient to manage your pain.No one can tell you what's best for you....as Namnam pointed out. There are no experts on this forum.\u00a0\u00a0Pain management is often trial and error. It takes many of us several weeks or months....working with our physician to find an effective pain medication regimen.Prescription preferences and practices vary from physician to physician and state to state. Add to that the fact that our systems differ and what is effect for one may not be effective for another.....and the conclsion is that only you and your PMP can find the right combination/regimen that will work best for you.Some ppl do have good pain control on Opana and it is prescribed for chronic pain. Other ppl do not have great pain relief with it. But again working closely with your PMP in a trial and error approach should uncover that right combination for you specifically.Please let us know how you are doing and what you find to be effective. I will look forward to hearing from you.Take Care,~Tuck",

    "question": "ive been on oxycodone(oxycontin CR) for 6 years , 80mg 2x daily now for 3 years , and this is just not controlling my pain . Is the opana er a reasonable choice if i was to begin a different med for chronic pain relief from several back/spinal conditions which continue to worsen year after year? And what is the exchange rate for oxycontin 80 mg cr to opana er ?mg , thank you , jmz",
