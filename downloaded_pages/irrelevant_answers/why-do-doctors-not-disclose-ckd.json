            "answer": "Yes, I think you should have been alerted when your eGFR drifted below 60 that it was something to keep your eye on.I am beginning to think eGFR values of 50 - 60 are not uncommon.\u00a0\u00a0And it seems such readings are nothing to worry about IF they remain relatively flat AND you aren't battling high blood pressure or diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I read that most Americans will see their eGFR value fall below 60 sometime in their life, albeit mostly when they older ( > 60 y.o.)_Lazza",

            "answer": "Though it helps to know the other renal values on your labs I do not think you are crazy for wondering if you should have been advised sooner. Now that I am seeing a Nephrologist all he could do was wonder why my PCP waited for so long to refer me to a specialist.",

            "answer": "The reason I don't have the other renal values on the labs that the nephrologist ordered is because I have to wait until he sits down with me to discuss them. Since he is going on an extended vacation in August, I will be seeing him again on Sept. 10. He called me to report some of the labs I was anxious about, so I wouldn't worry so badly. Even he doesn't seem that concerned about my CKD and won't even call it that.\u00a0\u00a0I am so angry that this has been happening without my knowledge. I am 67, but I don't have high blood pressure or diabetes. I am not overweight and I exercise and eat properly. Now, I'm obsessed about foods I can and cannot eat. Those that can be eaten seem to be very few. This diagnosis has turned my life around. All my nep will say about food is to drink 64 ounces of water a day and cut down on protein. I can do that, but the diets I see for kidney patients are much more restrictive than that. I'm confused!",

    "question": "I visited my doctor recently for a routine blood test. Upon reviewing the results, I (not he) questioned the fact that my eGRF was only 50. He did send me to a nephrologist, who performed more tests, said I had no protein in my urine and found nothing else. He advised that I drink more water and eat less protein. I looked back at my blood work and I have had low functioning kidneys for at least two years. I don't have access to those done before that. There has been very little change over those two years. Am I crazy to be thinking that I should have been advised sooner?",
