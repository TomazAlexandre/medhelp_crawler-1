    "question": "I have had type 1 diabetes for over 15 years. I am 25 and recently put on about 10 kilos. My sugar levels have been good the past year and I am having more insulin then I used to but I don't think that's quite the issue. My appetite is crazy! I am hungry all the time. How many diabetics out there struggle with a hungry appetite? Its hard to ignore. I don't want to lose weight for my looks so much but more for my health. Has any type 1's out there tried diet pills? What works?",
