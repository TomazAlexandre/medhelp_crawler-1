            "answer": "Hello:\u00a0\u00a0I would visit a behavioral specialist--- there are so very many types of anxiety disorders that could cause these types of symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0As long as you've been cleared of the obvious heart/thyroid issues, it could be pyschological.\u00a0\u00a0I know this is a hard one to deal with, because it's complex.\u00a0\u00a0It would be worth a try though to see if you can take care of it relatively easy.\u00a0\u00a0Have you experienced any big changes lately, stresses [job change, move etc.] that might contribute to what's going on?\u00a0\u00a0I know panic attacks can cause chest pain, but now sure about the other limbs..... Call the doctor that gave you the XANAX and see if maybe these are conversion symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0He'll know what that is...best of luck!!! rockincricket",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!This looks like an episode of transient ischemic attack wherein the blood supply to brain is temporarily cut off. The episodes last for a maximum of 24 hours and then resolve or a new symptom starts. Otherwise it could be due to nerve compression very high up in the cervical vertebra. Benign intracranial hypertension is another possibility for your symptoms. Please consult a neurologist. You may need to undergo MRI of the brain or cervical spine.Another possibility is Vitamin B12 deficiency. Underactive thyroid and diabetes too should be ruled out.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Please discuss these possibilities with your neurologist. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Hi,for the past six months or so i've been experiencing semi regular sudden numbness or shocking feelings in a variety of limbs. These will happen when i'm waking up in the middle of the night, usually there accompanied by a few seconds of blurred vision, and eventually all symptoms would go away. For the longest time they would only occur in my arms or legs, but recently I had the strongest of the attacks, it was in my chest and shoulders and was much stronger than ever. Of course since it was in my chest I went to the ER and they cleared me of any heart related problems, they did blood tests and cleared me of any thyroid of diabetes problems. Before this episode i was prescribed xanax because my doctor thought it might be stress related, while it did seem to help, these new stronger symptoms have not been effected by the xanax at all, and since the initial attack have been occuring much more frequently.any ideas? i've search about everything with no luck",
