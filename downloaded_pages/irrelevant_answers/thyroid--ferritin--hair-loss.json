            "answer": "Is I have had Hypo for 35 years and from experience I would never allow anyone other then a board certified Endocrinologist\u00a0\u00a0treat me. They have all of the specialized training needed to treat this very delicate condition. I had a GP treat me once when I was first diagnosed and I became so sick I thought I would die. Thyroid can cause miscarriages (I had 9) along with so much that can keep you from enjoying your life. I am 59 and life passes fast honey, don't waste a minute of it. Oh, and here is a funny thing...if you eat Brussels sprouts if can effect the medication.",

            "answer": "Dr Mercola - Little-Known Secrets About Optimal Iron Levels...\"The healthy range of serum ferritin lies between 20 and 80 ng/ml. Below 20, you are iron deficient, and above 80, you have an iron surplus.Ferritin levels can go really high. I\u2019ve seen levels over 1,000, but anything over 80 is likely going to be a problem.The ideal range is 40-60 ng/ml.As a real-life example of what high iron levels can do to your health, when I first learned about this many years ago, I tested myself and my entire family and my dad had very high ferritin levels \u2013 about 500. It caused damage in his pancreas and he developed type 1 diabetes.Fortunately, we found out early enough to reverse some of the damage. His diabetes was also controlled to a point over a number of years, so he requires only intermittent uses of low dose insulin now.High ferritin/iron levels are also one of the primary factors I\u2019ve seen in many cases of liver disease, especially hepatitis C. Many patients presenting hepatitis C symptoms improved dramatically once their ferritin levels were lowered.\"",

            "answer": "Sure I've seen the studies by Rushton on ferritin and hair growth. But there are many studies on iron and hair loss and some conflict with each other. You have to look at your own labs and adjust accordingly.J Am Acad Dermatol. 2010 Dec;63(6):1077-82. Commentary: Iron deficiency and hair loss: problems with measurement of iron...\"Iron is involved in many critical physiologic processes within the hair follicle, suggesting that iron deficiency could disrupt hair synthesis. However, studies of iron as a cause of hair loss have produced conflicting results. Some of the discrepancies may relate to limitations of assays for iron deficiency. This commentary discusses the sensitivity and specificity of available tests for iron deficiency and presents practical guidelines for testing and supplementation.\"***Excerpt from Tired Thyroid - T4's role in the body...\"Hair needs T4, because it lengthens the hair growth phase. [26]\u00a0\u00a0My Free T3 has been below range, mid-range, and over-range, but my hair was still not right at any of those levels. Only since adding T4 to get my Free T4 above mid-range (and lowering my desiccated dose) has both my hair texture and volume improved.\u00a0\u00a0It should be noted that hair loss is a symptom of both too much and too little thyroid.\"",

    "question": "I am hypothyroid/hashimotos.\u00a0\u00a0I have been experiencing significant hair loss for over a year. I'm young and female so having sparse hair is NOT ok.\u00a0\u00a0I've read one needs to have their ferritin at 70 or 80 to experience hair regrowth.\u00a0\u00a0When I first met with my naturopath and got diagnosed this year I was put on 25mcg of Levothyroxine and I told her my main concern was my hair loss. My ferritn was at 32.\u00a0\u00a0I was put on a daily elemental iron supplement.A blood test a month later and I was already at 54! Two months after that i was at 68.3!\u00a0\u00a0I was getting close to my goal but at that test she didn't like how my iron and iron saturation went too high/out of range.\u00a0\u00a0So she told me to only take my iron pill ever OTHER day and lo and behold two months later my ferritin was down to 45.1.\u00a0\u00a0Super frustrating. I am trying to bring my iron UP! So how does this work? How can my iron and iron saturation be so high and my ferritin so low? Is it actually dangerous for me to take the pill daily if my iron saturation and iron are above the limit? I'm not going to be able to fix my hair loss and bring my ferritin up if I am only taking it every other day! HELP!",
