            "answer": "Hi there,I'm glad you have an appt. at the end of Feb. Every case can be so different. MS is a clinical dx, so the MRIs do not tell the whole tale. Meaning unchanged for one individual may mean one thing, and something different for another.To truly understand MS or not MS, it's important to recognize that it varies. Hoping you have a thorough appt. coming up - one where all your questions will be answered. They are good questions btw :) Write it down, and bring it with you!Thanks for joining us!-Shell",

    "question": "I've been to two different neurologists.The last one works in the MS clinic - but sees other patients.I started having symptoms 1 1/2 years ago. Initally as sharp righ sided head pain and dizziness as well as weakness.\u00a0\u00a0have been tested and treated for Migraines (which I do not have) and have had nearly every possible angle ruled out (no lupus, lyme etc..) .\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms got worse.\u00a0\u00a0Going to the second neuro she said it's probable that my head / face pain was Trigeminal Neuralgia and put me on Gabapentin.\u00a0\u00a0This has helped my headpain reduce by 75% but my weakness (right side), hand tremor (right side) dizziness and fatigue continue.She sent me to get a follow up MRI (my first one shows multiple scattered spots but nothing definitive of anything) and this last one was on a 3T machine.The following is what the radiologist report came back as.\u00a0\u00a0My current Neuro said that it's good MRI stayed consistent with nothing new and that it's likely I do not have MS. However is sending me to get three days IV treatment with Sumederol (sp?) to see if that helps my symptoms.Below is what the report says.Because an MRI comes back as unchanged, does that make the diagnosis of MS no longer a possibilty? or is it just a wait and see game.\u00a0\u00a0She said she would answer my further questions on our appointment at end of Feb... I only was allowed to briefly talk to her on the phone when she called about my latest MRI results.Also, if this isn't MS related.. what the HELL could it be?--------- (MRI results below)-----Clinical History: Blurred vision, neuralgia and neuritis.Patient complains 14 month history of head pain and weakness.Possible multiple sclerosis.TECHNIQUE: Multisequence multiplanar MR imaging of the brainwas performed before and after administration of IV gadoliniumcontrast, without adverse event reported.FINDINGS:Brain volume/extra axial spaces/basal cisterns: Prevertebralvolume is within normal limits, stable in comparison to priorimaging.Brain parenchyma: No diffusion restriction. Following theintravenous administration of contrast, there is no abnormalenhancement.Lobulated T2 hyperintense and T1 hypointense focus isidentified within the left posterior parietal lobe (axial T2series 9, image 17). The focus follows CSF signal on allsequences and is most consistent with a parenchymal cyst. Thereis no associated enhancement.There is no diffusion restriction.Punctate foci of T2 and FLAIR signal hyperintensity areidentified within the periventricular and subcortical whitematter of the frontal lobes and parietal lobes. Overall thedistribution of findings is greater than expected for thepatient's age. Side-by-side comparison with the study dated2/15/2012 demonstrates no significant interval change in thesize, number or distribution of lesions. Findings arenonspecific and differential considerations includedemyelination such as multiple sclerosis or chronicmicrovascular ischemic change related to hypertension, diabetesor migraine headaches.Hemorrhage: There is no evidence of intraparenchymal orextra-axial hemorrhage.Ventricles: Ventricles, sulci and cisterns are normal for agewithout evidence of mass effect or shift.Herniation: None.Calvarium: The bony calvarium is within normal limits.Vascular system: Flow voids in the major intracranial vesselsare within normal limits.Sinuses: Paranasal sinuses are clear. The globes and orbits arewithin normal limits.Orbits: Orbits are normal.Visualized sella, mastoid air cells and skull base: Normal.Visualized cervical spine: Normal.PROTON MR SPECTROSCOPY was performed with 3D water suppressedacquisition.Three dimensional long TE spectra were acquired.from four contiguous slices including, 1) basal ganglia, 2)infra callosal, 3) callosal and 4) supra callosal locations.Quantitative processing of the spectra yields ratios of thefollowing metabolites:Basal ganglia:Choline/Creatine = 1.16 (normal range 0.52-2.19)Choline/NAA = 0.76 (normal range 0.39-1.00)NAA/Creatine = 1.53 (normal range 1.15-2.77)Glu/Cr = 0.09 (normal range 0.10-0.42)Infra callosal:Choline/Creatine = 1.21 (normal range 0.81-1.87)Choline/NAA = 0.6 (normal range 0.38-0.86)NAA/Creatine = 2.02 (normal range 1.86-2.46)Glu/Cr = 0.09 (normal range 0.20-0.36)Callosal:Choline/Creatine = 1.21 (normal range 1.04-1.66)Choline/NAA = 0.56 (normal range 0.45-0.71)NAA/Creatine = 2.15 (normal range 1.98-2.65)Glu/Cr = 0.18 (normal range 0.24-0.37)Supra callosal:Choline/Creatine = 1.17 (normal range 0.96-1.63)Choline/NAA = 0.54 (normal range 0.40.-0.63)NAA/Creatine = 2.17 (normal range 2.10-2.92)Glu/Cr = 0.22 (normal range 0.23-0.46)Z-Average values for the metabolite ratios:Choline/creatinine = 0.131Choline/NAA = 0.163NAA/creatinine = -0.16Glu/Cr = 0.7630The MR spectroscopy findings are grossly within normal limits.IMPRESSION:1. Punctate foci of T2 and FLAIR signal hyperintensityprimarily in the subcortical white matter distributioninvolving the frontal lobes and parietal lobes, unchanged insize, contour or characteristics in comparison to 2/15/2012.Differential considerations include demyelination such asmultiple sclerosis, or advanced chronic microvascular ischemicchange usually related to hypertension or diabetes. Clinicalcorrelation is recommended.2. No abnormal enhancement.3. No diffusion restriction4. Cystic cavity within the left posterior parietal lobe,stable in comparison to prior imaging.",
