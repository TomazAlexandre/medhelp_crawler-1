            "answer": "Its not unusual nor a concern to have some valve leakage.\u00a0\u00a0If your heart rate is sustained over 100 at rest, that could indicate a medical problem.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not sure what you mean by pulmonary \"tension\", but I\u00a0\u00a0assume pulmonary hypertension.... If pulmonary hypertension is present, further evaluation may include assessment of oxygenation, pulmonary function testing, high-resolution computed tomography of the chest, ventilation-perfusion lung scanning and cardiac catheterization...worst case scenario.As an insight pulmonary hypertension is a complex problem characterized by nonspecific signs and symptoms and having multiple potential causes. It may be defined as a pulmonary artery systolic pressure greater than 30 mm Hg or a pulmonary artery mean pressure greater than 20 mm Hg.",
