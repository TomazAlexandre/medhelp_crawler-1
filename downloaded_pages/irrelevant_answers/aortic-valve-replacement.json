            "answer": "RE: Penicillin prophylaxis: Bacteremia. It can cause endocarditis, bad news. It affects all heart valves, whether prosthetic or not, and most easily enters the blood stream from skin that is cut, particularly from the bacteria legion in the mouth. It's a precaution, and anyone with vulnerable heart valves has been taking it for many years. I've been taking it before dental work and surgery for over 40 years and the\u00a0\u00a0'protocol' established after lengthy research is 2000 mg, an hour before dental work.",

            "answer": "Thanks for your answer.\u00a0\u00a0It just seemed like the surgery went well, the prognosis was excellent, and my recovery was amazing.\u00a0\u00a0Then the cardiology team insists on close follow-up for the rest of my life, and when I needed emergency surgery, it was a big deal because of the coumadin intake, without time to lower the dosage before the surgery.\u00a0\u00a0A urinary tract infection required a week in the hospital because I lost a lot of blood and it was feared I would go into shock.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't realize that even oral surgery would be dangerous.\u00a0\u00a0But if I hadn't had the heart valve replacement, I would have surely died, so maybe the alternative isn't so bad, even though I didn't expect it.",

            "answer": "I know how you feel, Lee.\u00a0\u00a0I have valve surgery in my future formod. to severe aortic insufficiency.\u00a0\u00a0The surgeon I talked with said that probably a mechanical valve would be my best choice when the time came, because of my age (49).It seems any medical procedure that would have been not thatcomplicated at one time, now revolves around my bad heart valve, and that scares me.And not all of my doctors agree on what procedures I should or should not be on antibiotocs for, and my gynecologist makes me feel that if I'm onantiobiotics too often, they could be ineffective should thecase arise that I really need them.Then, after the valve is replaced, I will still have to be concerned about antiobiotics and infection, but also bleeding from coumidin.\u00a0\u00a0Then, I worryabout getting older and maybe down the road acquiring diabetes, since it runs in my family, or cancer and need treatments, or other major surgery, all which could affect my heart adversely.I don't know, perhaps I dwell on these things too much, but sometimes I get real depressed.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder how many years I have ahead of me and what complications I may encounter.\u00a0\u00a0I dread having surgery, and I'm also afraid that after the surgery, maybe I will still have problems.I'm sorry to sound so down, but I'm going through one of my down times.\u00a0\u00a0I'm also having a few other medical problems, and all of this hitting at one time is starting to get to me.Thanks for listening.",

    "question": "In December 1995 I had an emergency valve replacement surgery, due to a bicuspid valve and subsequent advanced calcification, not only of the aortic, but mitral valves and septum.\u00a0\u00a0I was told the opening of the aortic valve measured .3 cm, and that I was very lucky to be alive.\u00a0\u00a0I now have a St. Jude's valve, and am being monitored for my coumadin level every two weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I was also told that the valve would probably last a lifetime.\u00a0\u00a0If this is true, why does my cardiologist want to see me every six months?\u00a0\u00a0I understand why my tendency to bleed causes a concern, and why I must take penicillin prior to dental work or surgery, but I still wonder what could possible go wrong with the valve itself, if it is infallible?",
