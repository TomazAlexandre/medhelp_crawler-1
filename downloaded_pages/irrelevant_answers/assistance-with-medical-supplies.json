            "answer": "This is a difficult issue for many people.\u00a0\u00a0People don't realize just how expensive managing diabetes can be.\u00a0\u00a0I have a couple of suggestions, but I can't promise that any of them will come through for you.\u00a0\u00a0Test strips seem to be the most difficult thing to obtain at reduced rates.First, I would ask your doctor to write a letter to wherever you state assistance is coming from and emphasize the importance of testing to maintining your health. Sometimes these things can be appealed especially if your doctor makes a good case for you.If that doesn't work, go to www.rxassist.org.\u00a0\u00a0Every drug company is listed on this site and you can apply directly to the individual companies for what you need.\u00a0\u00a0I would go to all the companies that produce blood testing machines and strips, even if you are not currently using their machine. You may need to do a little research on all the different companies that have them.\u00a0\u00a0 Most companies will give you the machine for free so you will use their strips. The work will come in finding out which company is willing to supply you with the test strips. They will ask you to fill out some forms and you may have to get a prescription for your strips even though they are technically not a prescription item.\u00a0\u00a0For any companies that may not be on this site, contact them directly and ask if they have any assistance programs.\u00a0\u00a0I would also try your Public Health Department and your own physician.\u00a0\u00a0They often have samples of machines and strips and sometimes they can get specific things from their drug reps.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't limit your request to just your diabetes doctor.\u00a0\u00a0I would ask any doctor that you see.It sounds like you are already in the state system, but if there is a county hospital for the indigent, it may be worthwhile for you to get into that system temporarily until you get back to work.\u00a0\u00a0You may have to go through a clinic system to see a doctor, but prescriptions are usually available at very low cost.\u00a0\u00a0Again, make sure your physician writes a prescription for the test strips and he may also have to emphasize the importance of testing.I would also contact your local JDRF to see if they have any local resources for test strips or know of any other local assistance programs for diabetic supplies.I wish you luck and hope this helps.Es",

She gave instructions there on how to reach her.Perhaps she can help you, too.\u00a0\u00a0If I remember right, she was going to away for a week or two, so please be patient.\u00a0\u00a0When she returns, I'm certain you'll hear from her...Good luck!",

            "answer": "In addition to the advice you have already been given here, let me suggest that you contact the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's (JDRF) Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST). The web url is www.jdrf.org, and if you click on the ODST link on the left side of the home page, you will be directed to a window where you can send us an e-mail, stating your needs (lack of insurance coverage for test strips). We have one JDRF staff member who answers all of the many questions about this subject that come up, and if you make sure you tell us where you are located, he may well be able to direct you to a source for help. This is his specialty and he has a wealth of good information, for many diabetics are in the same tough spot that you are in, unable to afford the test strips that are absolutely essential to good control. We hope to hear from you.",

            "answer": "my request is more for my 21 year old son than for me. I have been a diabetic for more than thirty years and my son was diagnosed about two years ago. He recently lost his job and along with it, his health insurance. Therefore, he has been without his insulin for more than five months. I have tried to share my insulin with him, but am afraid that we both are not getting the medication we need. I am on medicare and disability. He has discussed trying to go to the county clinics, but we are without transportation and he has been using any finances to ride the bus to find another job. I want to save his life and keep him as healthy as possible for as long as possible. Please tell me what I can do to help my only child.",
