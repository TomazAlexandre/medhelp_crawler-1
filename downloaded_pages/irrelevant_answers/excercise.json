            "answer": "That's kind of a difficult question to answer. Without knowing your weightloss goals, your eating habits, and your history with losing weight before.But if you are in general good health meaning your doctor has not told you to not work out or be limited in certain areas, then I would suggest these exercises.You should try to mix your workouts with a combination of cardio and weight or resistance training. Walking is a great cardio which is easy on your legs and knees. And quite frankly loses quite a bit of calories. You can also go jogging if that works for you. But start out slowly until you are used to it.You can also get on machines like Elliptical Trainers, Treadmill's, bikes, and stairs. If you have stairs available at your home or work you can always use those for running up and down during lunch or something.Also keep your food in check and know what you are eating and when. If you normally eat 2300 calories of food a day, try dropping that to 2100 or even 1800. Take it slow and try changing a few things at a time. Good luck",

            "answer": "Portion size, portion size, portion size. :)\u00a0\u00a0Americans in general have a skewed perception of that a realistic portion size is. A large apple is actually closer to two portions, not one. Half of a typical deli bagel is closer to two portions. A serving of meat is about the size of a deck of playing cards. Vegetables, about the size of your fist.Fat-free does not mean you can eat more of it. :) Look for loads of hidden sugar in fat-free foods.Eat slowly, small bites, and put your fork down to chew. It takes about 20 minutes for the brain to perceive that the stomach is full, so eating fast means that by the time you feel full, you've had too much. Eat slowly and mindfully - when you perceive that you're not hungry any more, STOP, even if there's still food on your plate. It may mean you're hungry again in a few hours, but eating smaller meals more frequently stabilizes your blood sugar and minimizes the urge to binge.If you can't jog, look for water exercise classes which can often combine cardio and resistance training.",

            "answer": "You might want to see a nutritionist for advice about losing weight and exercising with diabetes. Many hospitals and the American Diabetes Association (www.diabetes.org) often offer free classes on managing your disease. Not only is diet an issue, you have to be careful with the type of exercise you do because you must be extremely careful with your feet.Drinking tons of water helps you lose weight, but with diabetes you have to be mindful of your kidneys. Again, a nutritionist is probably a good place to start for advice.You're probably looking a a big lifestyle change and it's best to move slowly, take one small change at a time. You didn't get to this point overnight, and you won't fix it overnight, either.\u00a0\u00a0Trying to change your entire lifestyle all at once is a recipe for frustration and failure. With type 2 diabetes, failure is not an option, so set yourself up for success by breaking up big goals into smaller ones. For example, if you have 50 lbs to lose, set a goal of 5 lbs. Once you get there, set your sights on 5 more.Good luck!",

            "answer": "In addition, exercise will help your knee pain. I've had rheumatoid arthritis pretty much all my life and I can tell you that even if you have pain, doing some kind of low- or no-impact exercise will help you. Swimming, water exercise, cycling, yoga, tai chi...\u00a0\u00a0My father in law has had both knees replaced but even when his knees were at their worse (before the surgery) he rode his bicycle and it helped.",
