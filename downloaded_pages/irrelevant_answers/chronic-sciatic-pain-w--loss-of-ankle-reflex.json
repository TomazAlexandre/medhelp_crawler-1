            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in.Most of your problems seem to stem from damage to S1 nerve. S1 nerve supplies the back of the calf and this leads to problems with the foot push.Numbness of S1 nerve runs on the outside of the foot, it also supplies the ankle jerk. This can explain the loss of ankle jerk.I would suggest you to take OTC B complex supplements and get in touch with a good rehab specialist. Physiotherapy may help you deal with your symptoms.It is also important to rule out diabetes as diabetes can damage the nerves.Hope this helps!",

    "question": "I hate to bother you when there are so many life and death matters you deal with, but my pain is so intense, and has been for many years, but unbearable for the last 10 months.\u00a0\u00a0I am a 52 yr. old female who has felt something neurolical was the problem with the pain mostly around my knee and shin.\u00a0\u00a0It came on shortly after the birth of my 1st son 28 yrs. ago.\u00a0\u00a0I spoke to my parents best friend who was an orthopedic surgeon, and in true form scared me to death with the prospect of a very large needle being inserted into my knee. I was young and able to deal with it at the time so I did.\u00a0\u00a0It was more of an aggrevation than an excrutiating pain.\u00a0\u00a0Well, I rocked along for years with the pain growing, but as good doctor's daughter I didn't complain.\u00a0\u00a0Then after 10 yrs. I mentioned it to my new brother-in-law and he told me to lose weight. Again I knew that wasn't it because it hurt when I weighed 110, and it hurt when I was 150, about where I am today.\u00a0\u00a0Again I said no more.\u00a0\u00a0Now, 10 plus years later I am to the point where life is just not worth living.\u00a0\u00a0I am cross with my children because of the pain, and lack of sleep. I sleep about 4 hrs. a night, and that's taking large amts. of Benedryl and lately an Ambian. Without it I wouldn't sleep at all.\u00a0\u00a0Been there, tried that.\u00a0\u00a0Since Jan. 2008, I have had MRIs of my lumbar, pelvis and knee, all of which showed no significance. I was sent to a physiologist (I think that's his specialty) and he did nerve conduction and EMG tests, and they showed significant damage to the S1 nerve.\u00a0\u00a0I also have no ankle reflex. My left leg has lost significant muscle loss, and seems to be shrinking everyday.\u00a0\u00a0Right now the calf is 2\" smaller on the left and 1 1/2 smaller at the thigh.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 6 steroid epidurals, and though I didn't think they helped, now that they have worn off I can tell they did.\u00a0\u00a0It wasn't optimum.\u00a0\u00a0I went from a 9, to about a 7.\u00a0\u00a0The back has never hurt, but lately it is constantly nagging, but I can certainly live with it.\u00a0\u00a0Actually anti-inflammatories are fine for that, but does nothing to give relief from the hip and leg pain.\u00a0\u00a0Since my epidurals are exhausted through my health insurance for a few more months, I was wondering if you could give me some advice as to where the doctors can look next.\u00a0\u00a0Since it's not the vertebra, my brother-in-law is pretty much out of it.\u00a0\u00a0I will be returning to the doctor to get my Neurontin refilled, and would love to be able to ask some questions about locating the culprit of this pain.\u00a0\u00a0I have had 4 csections, and an abdominal hysterectomy to remove my uterus and was barely in pain.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, I was given morphine pumps and I remember commenting that I couldn't tell I had surgery, but my leg still hurt like hell.\u00a0\u00a0Thank you so much for your time.\u00a0\u00a0I wouldn't bother you, but I really am at wits end. Thanks again.",
