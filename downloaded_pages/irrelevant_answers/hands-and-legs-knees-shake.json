            "answer": "Yes, the symptoms you report do sound like hypoglycemia-low blood sugar. Low blood sugar can be experienced by both type 2's and type 1's, though severe hypoglycmia is more often associated with insulin use. You don't say what treatment(s) you are using: low carb diet, oral meds or insulin. You also don't say what your blood sugar is when you experience these symptoms. You need to test your blood sugar on a regular basis especially when you feel \"off\". You have to treat any blood sugar under 60 with the appropriate (for you) number of glucose tablets. Some people treat at 70, but at that number if it is mealtime I would go ahead and eat, being sure to eat some carbs. If you are experiencing lows on a very regular basis you should talk to your doctor or endo.",
