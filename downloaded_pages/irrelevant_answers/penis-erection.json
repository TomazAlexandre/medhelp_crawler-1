            "answer": "Hi,I would first of all want to know your age and if you have any comorbid conditions, and also about your personal habits like smoking, alcohol and any stress. Your condition could be due to Impotency, it's seen in elderly and in smokers and alcoholics and sometimes in stress and can be drug induced, it would be better to relax and enjoy the intimacy and indulge yourself in foreplay much longer rather than trying for medications. If you are a diabetic and your sugars are under control then you may meet a physician who would rule out all causes of impotency and if needed would start on Viagra.",
