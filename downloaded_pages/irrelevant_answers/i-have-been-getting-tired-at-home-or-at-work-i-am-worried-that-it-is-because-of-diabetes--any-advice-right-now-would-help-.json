            "answer": "In the diabetes world a balanced diet does not include a sweet tooth. Eating sugary foods will elevate your blood sugar [glucose] then cause a sugar crash resulting in extreme fatigue, among other things. Also, what you may consider a \"balanced diet\" may not be in our eyes. More information [what you eat for every meal] is needed to conclude if it is indeed balanced.If you can obtain a home A1c test meter, I suggest you get one and follow the provided instructions. If the test results is higher than 5% [percent] you should see a doctor for proper medical evaluation and medication as needed.",
