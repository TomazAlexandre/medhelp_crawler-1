            "answer": "Hi,I have had all you symptoms for the last 2-2.5 years..my back problems has cost me dearly financially on physios/chiros/sports physicians etc, work and relationships.My hips will not hold...to the point one of my physios said she thought I must have a hormonal imbalance ie oestrogen dominance to cause the lack of muscle support in the hip flexors.I ve had everything ie thyroid tested, bouts of vertigo so MRI (fine) exhaustion, hair loss, gained 30 kilos..big fat stomach..sleep problems, craving salt and sugar, dry skin, abdominal fast, excessive urination, depression with suicidal ideation and extreme fatigue and constant infections...every test...fine!!!After non stop research I came across adrenal exhaustion and made my GP test my cortisol levels...voila they are super low (120 when supposed to be 220-400) had synactin (ACTH) stimulation test and it was satisfactory except that my base cortisol level was (90). So my gp is asking for more tests in the meantime I;ve found that this adrenal exhaustion can affect 3 small muscle groups in the hips, knees and ankles causing constant instability!!Low cortisol/adrenal exhaustion is the other side of adrenal fatigue or excessive cortisol hence the fat stomach...chronic fatigue. It will affect the thyroid particularly but will not show on a blood test, but all the symptoms of hypothyroidism, but if you take supplement to fix the thyroid it only makes the adrenal more unbalanced.I'm booked to see an endo, but do not mant to go down any synthetic hormone trap so am going to focus on nutrition (high protein, low fat, low carb), yoga and meditation for stress, Macca powder to balance the hormones and Omega 3/Omega 6 and see how I go! My back pain has been so bad to do yoga but since I stopped having yeast ie bread it has improved enough to try.Good luck hope it helpsAmy",

            "answer": "I tried macca, cats' claw, etc. etc. etc. Nothing over the counter is going to lower your cortisol levels - you need to go find a competent endocrinologist - a neuro endocrinologist (most endos treat diabetes and do not know, understand or treat Cushing's at all!) and get treated. You cannot treat or slow down Cushing's via nutrition - it is likely a tumor that is damaging your body. Cortisol will attack bones, muscles and more.If every test is fine - you may have the cyclical form which is the form that I had - I also had many normal test but you have to learn how to test - basically test when you feel good - to catch high levels. Cortisol can swing high and low and cause a lot of pain.However, good nutrition helps to slow the damage, it cannot stop it - and if you have surgery, you will have to take replacement cortisol and at the moment, the only cortisol replacements that are stable are synthetic. Hydrocortisone, however, is very close to what the body makes.",

            "answer": "I also am a nurse LPN but on disability now due to major back surgery from a fall rupturing 4 disc. I had to have a laminectomy c fusion and rods. Anyway, i am a member of the thyroid disorders and came over here to read about the adrenal problems that have made me wonder if i could have it. I also am worrying about diabetes because i also urinate constantly. Have you had your thyroid levels checked? It seems to me that you have alot of hypothyroidism symptoms although i realize many of all of these problems have alot of the same symptoms. good luck to you and god bless",

I\u00a0\u00a0hope to get some answers soon so I can just go back to the life I once had.\u00a0\u00a0Keep us posted on your Endo visit and I hope you can get a diagonosis.

It sounds like you have been through alot with your back surg. and now disability.\u00a0\u00a0Sorry to hear that.\u00a0\u00a0How are you dealing?As a nurse you would think I would've noticed that excessive urnination but it has been going\u00a0\u00a0on as long as I can remember and I even mentioned it to Dr's I was working with and they tested glucose and TSH and always said they were normal. Yes my TSH has always been WNL.\u00a0\u00a0So I figured it was me and guessed I was fine.\u00a0\u00a0IT wasn't until I had to do a 24 hour and measure all of my output for 24 hours that I noticed just how bad my polyuria was.\u00a0\u00a0After filling up almost 6L of urine I knew it was not right and saw that I was wayyy over the norm.\u00a0\u00a0I am thirsty so I drink and apparently it is alot.\u00a0\u00a0There is a form of diabetes insipidus that is mental and I hope I am not doing that. I don't think so though becuase I am thirsty.\u00a0\u00a0If I don't drink I feel really bad and get really dry mouth/skin/HA's.\u00a0\u00a0I guess I will find out soon what is wrong with me.\u00a0\u00a0Pit MRI next tue and if there is no tumor then I have to do a water deprivation test.\u00a0\u00a0Ughh.\u00a0\u00a0I don't want to have anything really bad wrong with me but just wish they would find the lesser of what it could be, just so I don't feel like a hypochondriac nut and can finally have an answer/diagnosis.Talk to your Dr about the amount you urintate. Lots of meds can cause thirst and dry mouth (I know that is not my cause because I only take Aleve for my back pain and birth control pills).\u00a0\u00a0I hope as time goes on your back pain gets better and that you can find a diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck!",

            "answer": "What you are describing sounds just like DI - I only had it for a while after pit surgery but it was awful. If you were on the pit forum, then another person who has it would be posting to you too... Keep drinking or you can end up in a dangerous situation. I would get some testing on the DI - there are several forms but the mental form is not typical.HessyCatPit MRIs can be wrong - the slices are 3mm - one of my tumors hid for 12 years.You guys know there are 4 types of DI. You need to be tested.The board has the rules - not me!",

    "question": "Hi I am a 33 year old female, 5 \"9, 150lbs., healthy until the past 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have not felt good since having my son 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I am a Registered Nurse and just have not been well physically since having my son. I am not depressed but do get frusterated at times for feeling so crappy (health) when I am only 33 and should feel good.\u00a0\u00a0After I had my son I had terrible back pain and have continued to have back pain off and on since.\u00a0\u00a0On top of that I have had at least 10 infections (all varying from UTI's to ear infection to pneumonia) requiring antibiotics since having my son.\u00a0\u00a0I also have experienced very dry skin, fatigue, hair loss/thining heat/cold intolerances, achy bones (still). I understand much of this is normal after having a baby but 2 years later is not normal. Lab work has always been normal except for when I have had an active infection did have elevated WBC. All during this time I have seen my primary internal medicine dr, who sent me to a physiatrist for the back pain. The medical staff knows I am a RN but have hinted at times that I am a hypochondriac because they could not find abnormal lab work or anything horrible on my MRI.\u00a0\u00a0MRI did find 3 buldging disks which explains my lower back pain but not my mid back pain.\u00a0\u00a0In the past 5 months I have also started getting eratic elevated Blood Pressures as high as 173/118 for no reason at all (not stressed or even doing anything) plus episodes of ha with dizziness. They come and go. Internal med. thought I may have a Pheochromocytoma but MRI and CT was neg.only thing that was noted was mild narrowing of my renal arteries which no specialist I have seen can seem to tell me if this is normal for someone my age.\u00a0\u00a0I did have excessive dopamine in 24 hour urine test as well as a huge output of 5000mL.\u00a0\u00a0I knew I always urinated alot but never knew it was that crazy.\u00a0\u00a0Then I was sent to a Endo. who just saw me for the first time last week and thinks I may have diabetes insipidus.\u00a0\u00a0Here are my most recent labs.\u00a0\u00a0Most are normal but the\u00a0\u00a0Cortisol (ACTH) stim test results and Urine Osmo.\u00a0\u00a0I have a brain MRI next week to r/o Pit. damage or tumor.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to know that there is a reason for all of this besides diabetes insipidus, which I know causes polyuria and polydipsia.\u00a0\u00a0But what about the back pain and other issues?\u00a0\u00a0Do the following lab results indicate another issue besides DI?Any help from someone who knows Endo?Component Latest Ref Rng 9/30/2010 9/30/2010 9/30/2010WBC'S AUTO 4.8-10.8 7.5RBC AUTO 3.80-5.40 4.19HGB 11.4-16.0 13.3HCT AUTO 34.2-47.0 38.2MCV 80-99 91.3MCHC 32-36 34.8RDW, RBC 11.5-14.5 12.9PLT'S AUTO 130-440 298NA 135-145 137K 3.5-5.3 3.9CL 98-108 103CO2 22-32 25HGH ng/mL 0.2IGF-I 276 . . .CORTISOL AM 4.3-22.4 12.8 29.1 (H) 33.7 (H)BUN 8-20 9CREAT 0.5-1.2 0.7CA 8.7-10.0 9.5OSMO 280-300 292OSMO UR 300-1300 138 (L)GLUC 60-200 98PROLACTIN 2.8-29.2 4.4",
