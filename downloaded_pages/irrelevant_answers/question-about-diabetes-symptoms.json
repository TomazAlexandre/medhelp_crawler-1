    "question": "Hi, my dad has really bad sugar diabetes. It's become so extreme because he didn't take his insulin or medication for about 15 or so years so he had to get his toe then his foot then up to his knee cut off.He has vascular blood disease,kidney failure [he will be starting dialysis soon],his eyesight has become very poor[he's legally blind],and he has severe neurapothy[sorry if I misspelled anything].His symptoms have been calm for a few months and it seemed like he was getting better, but all of a sudden he found out he has an ulcer on his remaining foot.It's decently bad and is turning a dark purple color with grey skin and white skin surrounding it. The doctor who discovered it said he might have to get this foot amputated as well. His medical center is the VA hospital and they think his diabetes may be caused by Agent Orange[which he was exposed to during Vietnam.]He's had a prosthetic leg for almost a year now also.My question is, has any one else had a problem like this and any suggestions that could help it or know of a specialist or doctor who could help?Any suggestions would be extremely appreciated.",
