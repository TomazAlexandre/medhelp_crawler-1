    "question": "I've had MRIs and blood test and everything came back normal, nothing has been explained for my symptoms which include dizziness, tunnel vision, sometimes fainting, headaches, breaking out in a cold sweat, and a ringing in my ears. What could it be? It's been happening repeatedly for the past several years. I exercise regularly and eat anytime I'm hungry. There is no history of diabetes in my family.",
