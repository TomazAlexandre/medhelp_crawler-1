    "question": "I think I might have diabetes... Here's a little background knowledge about me: I am a 16 year old male who goes to high school and doesnt have the greatest diet, I often eat out and dont think about the consequences, I am not overweight at all, rather in an athletic form due the sports i used to play (i quit to focus on school). Anyways, I seem to have a lot of the symptoms of type 2 diabetes :( I always hungry/thirsty, I always have to pee, I am always tired so I sleep a lot, my injuries take long to heal/wont (ex. i have plantar fasciitis from playing sports) and more recently i have got subconjunctival hemorrhage, 2 times in one week and my eyes weren't physically harmed to cause it. My grandpa has type 2 as well. I tell my friends about this and they just call me a hypochondriac. Am I? What should I do?",
