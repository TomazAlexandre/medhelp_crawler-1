            "answer": "well the reason i think there might be a possibility of exposure was because .. 1. i had sort of a cut right over scrotum bottom of penis. it was like a sore. im not really sure what to name it. but ive had that show up twice. 2. condom was provided by the other person. and 3. i heard that if you wash it right after it increases risk specially in uncircumsized",

    "question": "thanks for reading. OK first of all ive had many symptoms and have gotten tested for hiv recently but heres my story. about 2 or 3 months ago I got very drunk and had sex with transexual. first i received unprotected oral. then I gave him/her protected anal with condom. after that i took condom off and washed penis almost right away (I am uncircumsized) . then about 3-4 weeks later i started developing fevers. everybody kept telling me i was very hot but i didnt feel cold like with a normal fever. after that my tongue started getting white. ive had my tongue white for over a month now but its not a coating. it looks like i have white hairs on tongue and they get worse in the back ( it sort of looks like this but not as white...(http://www.doctorspiller.com/images/OralAnatomy/Circumvallate.jpg). I also have been getting swollen lymph nodes. its strange because i get a canker sore on one side of my mouth and then i get a swollen lymph on that same side under jaw. Ive also been getting various throat infections. Sometimes i feel very fatigued.I finally decided to get tested after two months of exposure. it was a fast 20 minute test with a blood sample. the result came out negative. but i hear alot about 3 and 6 month window period. ive done research and diabetes and hyperthyroidism have some symtpoms that are similar to mines. theres history of diabetes in my family and i have like 3 tumors on my thyroids but doc said they dont affect their function. (diagnosed over a year ago).. please help!. i have been getting very hot hands and feet but normal body temperature and its getting worse. I dont even know what to think anymore I am very concerned. please someone answer and help me ive been stressing out for the longest time now. I have a girlfriend and i wouldnt want to pass anything on to her so i need an answer asap. I have no medical insurance and financial situation is very tough",
