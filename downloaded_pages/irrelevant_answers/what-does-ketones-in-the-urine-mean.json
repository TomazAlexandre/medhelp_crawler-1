            "answer": "Keytones present in urine usually is a sign that the boy is breaking down its fat cells for energy. This is frequently related to undiagnosed or uncontrolled diabetes because in diabetes that is not controlled, the body cannot get its energy from the carbohydrates eaten because there is either not enough insulin or the insulin is not being used effectively by the body; therefore in diabetics who are not controlled, the body goes after its next resource for energy, fat.Diabetes is not the only cause for keytones being present in urine. Anything that causes the body to use its fat stores for energy will cause keytones to be present. People who are on low-carb diets such as the Atkins diet, end up burning off fat cells in much the same way as the uncontrolled diabetic, for in this case, the person is not eating enough carbs for the energy the body needs and so the body goes after the fat cells even though nothing is wrong. It is in this case simply\u00a0\u00a0a matter of going to the number 2 source for energy (fat) if the number 1 source (carbhydrates) is not available. In this case, no harm is done as long as the person actualy.Also, I have read that athletes can have keytones in the urine after extended periods of exercise. In this case, the body HAD carbohydrates available, but used them while in the exercise mode, and then uses fat cells to supplement the extraordinary need for energy during exercise of long duration.So the keytones may be present because or reasons unrelated to diabetes. The presence of keytones does probably mean that your daughter should be checked out by her doctor, for the keytones themselves are not a health risk, but the cause of the keytones MAY be a health issue, whether due to dietary issues, a balance of exercise and diet, or some other reason.",
