            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Well, if muscle cramps are due to dehydration and electrolyte balance, then this can get aggravated in summers and in hot weather. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle cramps in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Hope this helps. It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do consult your doctor. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thanks Doctornee,I will inquire further about your suggestions next time I see my GP who recently sent some blood samples for testing, being as my Dr at the previous practice returned the comment that he would love to have my results I am not supprised that the Dr at my new practice has not invited me back to discuss the more extensive range of tests Since the blood was taken a couple of weeks ago he suggested the further tests due to sleeping problems. .I have had Ostio arthritis confirmed after retiring from a lifetime of the heavy work of construction by two x rays taken 6 months apart, the expert commented it is mild/moderate and from the x rays said it was stable but if it progresses further I will be looking at some surgery so I do go to great length to check out any changes such as the night foot cramps I have noted which while infrequent have come on more often the past year. In the continued absence of any physical evidence I have suspected stress is the main factor.ThanksTerryroyroy",
