            "answer": "Hello,Bed wetting at night is also called nocturia and since your son has started wetting the bed recently, so it can be due to excess intake of fluids at night, infection, constipation, caffeine intake, insufficient ADH production or diabetes. My suggestion would be to limit his fluid intake at night 1 hour before sleep and if the symptoms persist then get an evaluation done from a urologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
