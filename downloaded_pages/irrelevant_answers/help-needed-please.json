How do I get my PCM to refer me to get the typing test? When I was first diagnosed her response was oh it's most likely type 2. I'm 5'7\" and am not even close to being overweight. After talking to a \"disease manager\" I finally have an appointment with a dietician, but there's been no mention of an endocrinologist yet.",

When I hit 22 units, my fasting number went to 81 from a starting number of 324. My concern is that even with the fasting level in normal range, my two hour BG level still spikes to the high 200's. I have followed the recommended diet and watch my carb count very carefully. Can I still be tested to find out which type I have or does it even matter at this point?",
