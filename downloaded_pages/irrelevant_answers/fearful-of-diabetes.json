            "answer": "I cannot answer all your questions, however I do believe that you should take what your doctor says to heart.\u00a0\u00a0Also, if you are so very fearful of being diabetic perhaps you can do what a friend of mine does - which is that every time she goes in to a medical office she has her blood tested.\u00a0\u00a0She is not diabetic but knows that I am.Yes, your weight could have something to do with being diabetic but I am 5 foot 9\" and weight over 300 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost weight but my diabetes was not discovered until I weighed much more than that.\u00a0\u00a0Believe me, I was really eating \"garbage\" at the time and had no sort of healty diet.My last suggestion simply is that if you are truly fearful of Diabetes being in your family blood line, request a complete physical from your doctor.\u00a0\u00a0You did not say what type of health coverage you have but mine is an HMO so that I have no problem getting the physical at any time.\u00a0\u00a0Hopefully you can have this done so that you can rest your mind.\u00a0\u00a0Or perhaps some type of counseling for the \"Cyperchondriac\" in you!God Bless, Anita",

            "answer": "Chronic worriers often find themselves reacting to problem after problem, putting out fire after fire, so to speak. A chronic worrier may always feel on the edge of disaster. It truly is a good idea to talk to a Psychological professional. With or without professional help, you will need to learn to start acting on your problems rather than reacting to them.",
