            "answer": "I've been diagnosed with thyroid (both Hashimoto's and Graves disease) and PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0Basically, I was diagnosed with PCOS first and my most my symptoms (including the weight gain) were said to be \"due to the PCOS\".\u00a0\u00a0My parents had been asking about my thyroid since before the PCOS diagnosis, but, of course, me only being 16 at the time, the doctors kept saying \"it's the PCOS, she's too young for something wrong with her thyroid!!\"\u00a0\u00a0It was about 12 months later the doctors finally did a thyroid test and I was diagnosed with thyroid issues.I have an appointment with my endo on may 6th to specifically discuss the combination of thyroid and PCOS.\u00a0\u00a0My gyno originally had me on birth control for the PCOS, but, then I had to discontinue that a few months ago after a blood clot (oestrogen isn't good for women with a history of clots).Good luck!!",

            "answer": "In my case, as far as I remember, the docs never directly related thyroid issues with PCOS, but thyroid issues to hypothyreosis; hypothyreosis to a slow metabolism, a slow metaboism to weight gain, weight gain to obesity, obesity to pre-diabetic issues and PCOS.The thyroid issues have been an incidential finding; I was diagnosed with Hashimoto and was put on L-Thyroxin 50\u00b5. That was 10 years ago; I weighted 50kg, had a small thyroid and no PCOS. I constantly put on weight, about two or three kgs in a year. The doc related it to the antibodies destroying my thyroid and causing hypothyrosis which slowed my metabolism down and raised hormone dose every half year. Five years ago, the ob/gyn suggested the depo shot for birth control due to health problems caused by estrogen in the pill. I was on L-Thyroxin 125\u00b5, weighted 60kg and had not PCOS. From that point, I constantly gained about five kgs a year. Endocrinologist and ob/gyn related it to hypothyrosis. One year ago, the endocrinologist found out my thyroid almost disappeared; I have about 0.5 ml thyroid tissue on each side, so she put me on L-Thyroxin 200\u00b5. With 83 kgs, I was officially diagnosed to be obese, so the doc recommended diagnostic issues on obesity risk. I was diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance and insuline resistance. I recently got off the depo shot for ttc. Routine ultrasound at at the ob/gyn revealed PCOS which the doc related to the combination of obesity with the depo shot.I wish you all the best for your appointment with the endocrinologist.",
