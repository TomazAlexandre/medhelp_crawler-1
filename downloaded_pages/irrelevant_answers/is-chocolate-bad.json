            "answer": "Chocolate won't harm your baby, but everything in moderation, right? Dark chocolate contains antioxidants, so if you like the slightly bitter taste it is the better option. But beware that the reason some might caution you against eating it is because 1, the amount of sugar that is found in chocolate is quite high, which can pose problems for pregnant women. And 2, all chocolate contains caffeine. Not as much as a cup of coffee, but it does have it. Most health practitioners encourage pregnant women to reduce or completely eliminate their caffeine consumption. But I would say as long as you do not have diabetes, gestational or otherwise, enjoying a small piece of quality chocolate now and then will not cause you or your baby any harm.",
