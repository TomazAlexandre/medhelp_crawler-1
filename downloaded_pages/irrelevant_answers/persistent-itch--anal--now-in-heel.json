            "answer": "Hello,Your symptoms are suggestive of eczema or dermatitis. Eczema is a form of chronic dermatitis (rash).Allergic reaction is one of the important causes of eczema. Allergic reaction can occur to strong soaps, Solvents, chemicals, certain foods, food additives, plants, metals, cosmetics, even urine and faeces of some animals (dust mites).You can take some OTC oral antihistamine medications like Benadryl or Claritin and see if it helps.For mild-moderate eczema a weak steroid may be used (e.g. hydrocortisone as dermacort), whilst more severe cases require a higher-potency steroid (e.g. clobetasol propionate, fluocinonide).Other possibilities are of dry skin(xerosis), skin conditions like psoriasis,dermatitis,lice,scabies and hives, internal diseases like liver and kidney disorders, iron deficiency anemia,diabetes and thyroid disorders.If even after taking benadryl,there is no relief then pls consult a dermatologist and discuss these options with him.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "For about two or three years I've had persistent itching in the anal area, especially at night.\u00a0\u00a0I saw a GP and she could not diagnose it, just prescribed me some antifungal cream with itch relief.\u00a0\u00a0I am able to control it with that and by washing at night with witch hazel.Lately I've also developed a persistent itch in one spot of one of my heels.\u00a0\u00a0It is maddening.\u00a0\u00a0I don't see any irritation or sore and it is only in one small spot on my heel.\u00a0\u00a0It feels a little bit crawly, but mostly just itch.\u00a0\u00a0I have to break up the callous and apply the anti-itch cream I usually use on my bum, and even that has limited effect.\u00a0\u00a0It has been going on for a month or two now and messes up my sleep.\u00a0\u00a0I am worried that in addition to having an itchy arse, I'm going to get itchy parts elsewhere.\u00a0\u00a0Any ideas what is going on?I'm a female and have had vaginal yeast infections, about once or twice a year, and lately have had some bacterial vaginal infections too.\u00a0\u00a0When I was younger I had a couple bouts of ringworm.\u00a0\u00a0The GP said it is her untested theory that once you get a fungal infection, you are susceptible to fungus in other forms.\u00a0\u00a0Is that's what is going on?\u00a0\u00a0I also read that diabetes may cause itching symptoms.",
