            "answer": "Hi!I am sorry to hear that you are in so much pain. Generalized body aches is unlikely to be due to car accident unless it is due to fibromyalgia and the car accident acted as a trigger. Unexplained aches and pains coming on and off could be due to fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus, Crohn\u2019s disease, H pylori infection, anemia, liver disorders, diabetes, hypothyroidism, Vit B12 or Vit D deficiency and due to calcium or magnesium deficiency. It can also be due to sleep related disorders. In women it can be due to hormonal disturbances related to PCOD. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Maybe a comprehensive investigation covering these points will help reach a diagnosis. Take care!",

            "answer": "I have discussed it with my doctor and it is looking like i am being diagnosed with a very bad case of rps the original areas effected were where my injuries were and spread through my body. I get absolutely no break from pain it just becomes worse for long periods of time. I did a full blood work up as well as xrays and all came back as I had stated. This is just extremely frustrating that what i know to be true and what my nerves believes to be true are two seperate things. I wish there was a definitive way of dealing with this as it's extremely and unbelievably painful when it goes beyond the tolerance I worked up over the years.",

    "question": "I am a 35 year old woman.. I was in a car crash 13 years ago that landed me in the trauma unit.. everything healed correctly but since then it's like my hasn't healed at all. Sitting up or standing can be severely painful some days not being able to move or get out of bed without assistance. A doctor in the emergency room has started me on Gabapentin as a nerve blocker and it is helping slightly, i take that along with Norco just to be able to have a little functionality. Can someone tell me whats going on?",
