            "answer": "Well, I tried a different web browser and did find the information.\u00a0\u00a0But must admit I don't like looking at web links - it is just more polite and courteous to have the details posted here if using this web site.As I am not going to join that web site I can only see some of the symptoms and not all.\u00a0\u00a0But will comment on what I have seen.What I can see is that you are a diabetic on metformin and have nerve pain and vision problems.This is very typical of uncontrolled sugar levels.You need to have\u00a0\u00a0regular check ups with regard your HBA1C blood tests and also see an ophthalmologist that does diabetic eye screening.\u00a0\u00a0If you are having a problem with your foods and controlling the sugar levels, it would be helpful for you to see a diabetic nurse or a diabetic dietician.High sugar levels in the blood will cause vision problems and can also lead to damage in the eyes called diabetic retinopathy that could lead to blindness - hence it is important to have your eyes screened every year.\u00a0\u00a0Having a check up with regard to vision is not the same as diabetic eye screening.\u00a0\u00a0So, you would have to ask the optical practise if they do diabetic screening.If you have high sugar levels in the blood stream, you may notice that your vision will be foggy, you may also notice that you need to urinate more often and get up in the night to urinate.Uncontrolled sugar levels in the blood stream can also cause nerve damage - and this can also happen way before diabetes is picked up.\u00a0\u00a0The pins and needles sensations in the feet is one of the signs of nerve damage.Ask your doctors practise if any of the doctors at your surgery runs a diabetic clinic so that you can book in to see that doctor and monitor how you are getting on.If the metformin and diet are not controlling your sugar levels, the doctor will either increase the dosage or consider the use of insulin - sometimes both are used.There are some antidepressants that work to relieve the discomfort of nerve damage, but unfortunately if there is nerve damage due to diabetes, there is no cure.Eat small meals with healthy snacks in between to cur any low sugar levels.\u00a0\u00a0Cut out junk foods, processed foods, cakes, biscuits, sweets, fizzy drinks, etc.\u00a0\u00a0Don't eat large meals at one sitting.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Eat more fruit (but don't go overboard with this) and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0Drink more water - 2 litres a day is usually recommended, more if you are sweating.Hope this helps.",

            "answer": "Hey Madison.Oh boy, or I should say... oh girl!You sure have an interesting history.I found numerous notable discrepancies, imbalances and \"cracks\" in your case.1. Your total cholesterol is dangerously low affecting D3 levels (vitamin D is more a hormone than a vitamin, dependent on adequate cholesterol levels) other hormones and nervous system function!!!The gallbladder removal makes this more challenging.2. Unresolved Internal/biological stress\u00a0\u00a0(not nervous tension) from childhood on, affecting physiologically the brain, hormonal & immune systems and other organs.3. TSH is not an efficient thyroid function test!It is the least useful thyroid test. It just indicates only the presence of this thyroid stimulating hormone in serum.For accurate testing of thyroid function you need Free T3, Free T4 AND Reverse T3!!!4. Your B12 and folate levels are IRRELEVANT and NOT indicative of neurological levels. The MMA testing does not reveal this.You need a homosysteine CFS test to test for Methylocobalamin and Tetrahydrofolate (methylated/neurological forms of these vitamins).5. The absence of a complete hormonal panel is of great concern.There's suspicion of Ovary-Adrenal-Thyroid Axis imbalance, estrogen dominance and more!6. No therapy has been mentioned in regards to childhood trauma/pstd.7. Your multiple drug interactions have numerous possible adverse implications!For example Bisoprolol and HCTZ may interfere with blood glucose control. Why are you taking 3 HBP meds?Zoloft and Wellbutrin combined may affect the central nervous system.8. Improper breathing patterns excasperate certain conditions like asthmaand also affect nitric oxide levels! (nitric oxide helps regulate blood pressure among other things).You may comment on the above and I will follow up asap, however, pleasenote that my comments and suggestions are not intended to replace medical advice.Best wishes.Niko",
