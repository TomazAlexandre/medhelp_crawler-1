            "answer": "Hi!If you have recently developed 4th nerve palsy, finding the cause will treat the palsy. The commonest causes are head injury, pseudotumor cerebri or beingn intracranial hypertension, hydrocephalus, hemorrhage, edema, infections such as meningitis or herpes zoster, demyelination (multiple sclerosis), and diabetic neuropathy. Treating the cause will treat the palsy. In some cases such as MS and diabetes, it may not be treatable and you may need surgery. The decision can be made by the doctor. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for responding. I apologize I didn't state in my initial post that I know the cause, it was head trauma, so I'm not sure that is treatable?I have been told it's just a waiting game, I was looking for some information is how long the wait is? I just heard from an Orthoptist that I should wait 6 months with unchanged vision before surgery. Sounds so very long.If you have anything more to offer, I appreciate it so much. Thanks, Kcosas",
