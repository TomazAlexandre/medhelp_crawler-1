    "question": "During the day I am fine. At night, I get stomach aches concentrated on my left side. To get releif, I have to get up or sit up for a while, then I go back to sleep. But in another 2-3 hours, like clockwork,\u00a0\u00a0same thing. I have had type 2 diabetes for a long time. My primary care doctor thinks I may have gastroparesis, but in a forum, people with that condiiton report much worse symptoms than I have, and they don't just say they have problems at night. They talk about heartburn/bloating, inability to eat, bad diarreea.\u00a0\u00a0I don't have those, although I have had softer stools and a little diarrea lately.\u00a0\u00a0Have an appt with a gastroenterologist in a month.\u00a0\u00a0This started some years ago, but only once per night after a big meal, and getting up for a minute was enough. It has gotton worse last few months.",
