He said I have Vitamin B6 deficiency, when I had all those symptoms, I starved myself for weeks, I started eating again in July when I got back m 3 months test results. Right now,i'm taking antibiotics and some other medicines for allergies, the antibiotics are for the tooth I had removed about 2 weeks ago.

Now vitamin B6, this is driving me insane. I have an appointment tomorrow with a new Doctor I chosed from my insurance. For a piece of mind, I will ask for another HIV test, and a PCR test, but I don't know if the DNA or RNA. Do you know????",
