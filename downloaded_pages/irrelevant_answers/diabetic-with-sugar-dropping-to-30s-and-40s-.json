            "answer": "Please try harder to get your father to understand that doctors are there to help him get better, at least more comfortable. And if he continues without medical assistance his life will become painful, worse than what it is now. You may have to set the doctor's appointment yourself and trick him into going. Perhaps if explained to the doctor's office, the doctor may see both your mother and father at the same time. At minimum your father needs to get an A1c test to see where his diabetes is at.",

    "question": "Hi, my father 53 and about 4 years ago he was diagnosed with diabetic type 2. I am getting very concerned because he has new symptoms that his docter is ignoring. He eats the way he should and still on a regular basis his sugar will drop down to the low forties even as low as 35. At that point he is no longer functional and completely delirious. He doesnt know who he is or anything else for that matter. And when we do get the sugar up to a normal level he is sick for days. He also has been experiencing severe lower back pain, weakness in his left leg, numbness and severe shaking.\u00a0\u00a0These symptoms seem to run in the family. Muscular Dystrophy and parkensens are both in the family. What should his doctor be looking for.",
