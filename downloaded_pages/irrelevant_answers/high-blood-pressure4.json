    "question": "Every other prenatal appointment I have been to, I have had high blood pressure. I dont have a regular doctor but I have midwives. Every appointment I have had a different midwife as to meet all of them before delivery to become familiar. I have been tested twice and had high blood sugar each both time before I was recommended a gestational diabetes test, I then had low blood sugar for the 12 hr fast. Having a different midwife each time seems to make things a little difficult and I don't feel safe. The last midwife I had said everything was fine and said they she didn't see anything out of the ordinary when in fact the midwife I had before her had ordered another glucose test out of concern. The last midwife had no idea until I told her about it and had her check. Shouldn't she have seen it in my file? Today at work I had to sit down after seeing black spots and feeling out of breath. I had a pulse of 99 and 144/92 blood pressure. My job is not overly exerting at all.. All I do is make beds and bring food and drinks to residents. This is not the first time I have felt this way,I am looking for advice. Do you ladies feel that I should be concerned? Is this normal ? Or is this something that I should bring to the attention of my health care providers and insist right away?",
