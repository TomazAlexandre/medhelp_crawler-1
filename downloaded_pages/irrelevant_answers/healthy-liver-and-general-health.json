            "answer": "Hi there!There can be many causes of fatty liver like dietary,obesity,intake of alcohol, severe weight loss,malnutrition,total parenteral nutrition, hepatitis C etc.It is also seen in patients with diabetes mellitus and those with high cholesterol and triglyceride levels. You seem to be otherwise healthy so a slight fatty liver can be easily cured. Are you obese? If you are obese then a program consisting of a nutritious low fat diet, exercise and weight reduction can be helpful. I will advise you to avoid sugary foods, saturated fats, and foods high in cholesterol. Use monosaturated fats like olive oil, canola oil instead of polyunsaturated fats. You may need supplements of vitamin B and E as they are good for liver.Do consult your doctor before starting any multivitamin supplements. All these will help.Take care and good luck!",
