My doctor us testing me because I have had excessive weight gain (i've already gained 30lbs) and that was the main sign. He also gave me a glucose test and wants me to have another ultrasound in 3weeks to make sure the baby isn't getting too big (which is a side affect from having gestational diabetes) I wouldn't worry too much about it unless you've had prior history or are gaining tons of weight like me :(",
