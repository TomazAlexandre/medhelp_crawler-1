            "answer": "Did they do the MRI with dye? I have MS and when they did an mri without dye it didn't quite show up took dye to get it to light it up and reveal itself. Lesions are like that. If it is not that could be in your neck have you had them check your neck? I am not a doctor but a patient who has experierenced your problem before and these are things they checked on me. Hand, wrist, shoulder, neck, spne, brain, spnal fluid when it continued to spread to the other arm as well then later the rest of my body with numbness as well. Do you or have you ever had any numbness?",
