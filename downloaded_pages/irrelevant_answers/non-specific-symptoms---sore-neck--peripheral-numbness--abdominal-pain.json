    "question": "All - please read my story and help me with insight or comments...Ok.\u00a0\u00a0I hope some of you folks will let me know please if you have or have had the same symptoms with Lyme.\u00a0\u00a0I have had so many non-specific symptoms in the last year.\u00a0\u00a0foggy head, very sore neck, sore lower back, floaters in eyes, headaches, testicular pain, fatigue (periods of \"waves\" of fatigue), coldness and numbness in hands and feet.\u00a0\u00a0I have had a truck load of blood tests (cbc, ana, liver panel, homocysteine, thyroid, b12, lyme, hepatitis, etc.., ct scans, mri/mra/mrv of head, mri of neck, ncv/emg, vestibular testing, upper endo, colonoscopy, and so many more.\u00a0\u00a0Almost everything is normal.\u00a0\u00a0My fasting glucose is sometimes a little high (~105 or so) and once I had a glucose measured after eating of 170 (probably one hour after eating).\u00a0\u00a0I had ketones in urine (50 was reported (not sure of units) recently, and cbc trends show a lowering white blood cell count over time (now 4.8) and a higher bilirubin (now 1.1).\u00a0\u00a0 I have tried supplements, chiropractic, even was sent to psychiatrist.\u00a0\u00a0No real help.\u00a0\u00a0Now I see a LLMD and he believes I have lyme based on clinical diagnosis.\u00a0\u00a0I am on doxy now.\u00a0\u00a0I also had two ablations a couple \\years ago for rapid heartbeat, one of them resulting in a pulmonary embolism.\u00a0\u00a0I am on meds for hypertension, acid reflux, and also take probiotics.What I hate are the periods of fatigue/headache...sometimes I feel like my bloodflow is being constricted, espically at night.\u00a0\u00a0My lower right back is very painful and the pain shoots down my leg.\u00a0\u00a0The other really concerning thing is this numbness in my hands.\u00a0\u00a0I wonder if this could be due to pre-diabetes or lyme, or pre-diabetes because of lyme?\u00a0\u00a0Any comments will be appreciated.Thanks,Bill",
