            "answer": "HiThanks for the post! How are you now?Yes the nerve conduction study should throw some light. What you will be surprised to note is that low activity of thyroid or hypothyroidism is associated with generalized aches and pains, muscle tenderness and aches, joint stiffness, swelling and pain, carpel tunnel syndrome and fatigue. If this occurs in combination with diabetes, the symptoms magnify. Please get your blood sugar examined also.This needs a more detailed investigation. I think you should discuss these possibilities with your doctor. It is difficult to comment beyond this without examining and pending tests. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "Please help if you can...I'm 21 years old, and from the outside I look healthy, but on the inside I'm suffering. I have been having these long lasting pain episodes for almost four years now and I do not know what is wrong. The pain is spontaneous and it doesn't seem to follow a pattern. Sometimes I wake up in the morning in extreme pain, other times I'm just fine and then all of a sudden I'm in excruciating pain. Nothing really seems to make it worse, and nothing really seems to make it better either. Also, the pain does not respond to any sort of pain medicine. Not even strong drugs like Norco. Its debilitating and I need some help. Here are my symptoms:*Random attacks of constant burning pain in hips/groin that radiates into my thighs.*Bilateral (Both sides of my body).*Random aches in my legs and arms (like growing pains).*Random stabbing pains all over my body (including my arms, legs, head and rarely-my eyes)*Extreme fatigue*Occasionally my legs \"fall asleep\" and feel numb, and sometimes I get the \"pins and needles\" sensation.For a long time it was just the severe pain in my hips and pelvis areas. Here recently I started noticing pain in my arms and the stabbing pains are getting worse and becoming more frequent. I haven't had any major injuries. The doctors have already ruled out Sciatica, Fibromyalgia, Kidney Problems and Arthritis. I had an MRI and Xray of my lumbar spine and they came back normal. Now the doctors are concerned that it could be a nerve problem. I am having an EMG/Nerve Conduction Study done on Tuesday, so I hope that helps. Also, my Thyroid hormone was out of range so the doctors wasnt to check that out next. How could hyperthyroidism be related to this pain? If anybody has any advice, it would be greatly appreciated as I am starting to go crazy :-) Thanks!",
