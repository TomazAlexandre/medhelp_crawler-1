            "answer": "I forgot to add, stress plays a big part in my pain. The more I am stressed the worse I feel. When something happens in my life that stresses me out the pain goes thru the roof the second it happens. A month ago my best friends husband killed his self and the second she called me told me my pain got so much worse that I layed in bed for hours and cried! You can also see a shrink to learn ways of handling stress and pain.Jamie",

    "question": "I have degenerative disc disease. I've had a nerve test done which showed normal nerves. I feel as if I have sciatica, but the MRI showed nothing of a pinched nerve, so I'm told. I notice nerve pain, and body tension more so when I have caffeine, whether it's chocolate or coffee. I am going to my pain doctor tommorrow to further discuss this, but I often wonder if this is due to my DDD. I feel very prone to pain, and tension when I am stressed, which I know is normal, but wondering about the whole caffeine and sugar. Could this be a sign of diabetes? Maybe I am having diabetic nerve pain??",
