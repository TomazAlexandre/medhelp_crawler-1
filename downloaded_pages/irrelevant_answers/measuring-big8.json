            "answer": "With my first I measured a month further along than I was, and then it switched to 2 weeks behind what I was. Those are benchmarks, not hard and fast rules. Also, if you were underweight to begin with, you may have just gained what you need to have a healthy baby. Just try to make healthy choices. If your Dr isn't concerned about your measurement, I wouldn't be either.",

    "question": "I am 27wks 5ds. I went to the doc yesterday and was told my blood count was at level 8, which is low. No diabetes or STDs. Gained 35lbs, which is the most docs want I to gain through out the whole pregnancy. My belly is measuring 30cm and it should only be 27cm. Also baby seems to be carrying very low. What's the deal?",
