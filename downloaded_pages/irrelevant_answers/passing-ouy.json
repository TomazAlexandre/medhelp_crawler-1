            "answer": "See a doctor to rule out hypoglycemia. Severe hypoglycemia can cause seizures. So can diabetes. The weird taste in her mouth may be ketoacidosis.Your daughter should get checked for these sort of insulin/blood sugar-related disorders, as well as epilepsy to see whether they are co-morbid, or only epilepsy or something else entirely. I know people who have diabetes type 2, and it seems to wean and wane depending on what their activity level/diet alterations/what was going on in their lives, so it's possible that her body could deal with it more or less for the past 8 years and now is starting to manifest itself again. Good Luck!",

            "answer": "This should be evaluated. Two things are concerning with loss of consciousness -- the heart and the nervous system. With regards to the heart, the biggest thing to consider is an arrhythmia (abnormal heart rhythm). This can be assess with an ECG, which is basically a tracing of the electrical activity of the heart. If nothing abnormal is seen on that, she might need to have a Holter monitor or Event monitor, which are just heart monitors worn for a period of time to watch for any abnormal heart rhythms during that time frame. She might also benefit from an echocardiogram to evaluate the structure of her heart, depending on how old she is. These can all be done by a general practitioner, who can refer to cardiology if anything is abnormal.With regards to the nervous system, this could be seizure activity, even if she doesn't have any of the stereotypical shaking movements. It could also be migraine headaches. It would not be unreasonable to see a neurologist.",
