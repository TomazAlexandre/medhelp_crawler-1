            "answer": "\"What does this indicate and how serious is it?\"Testing one hour after eating results in a false/positive. Glucose [blood sugar] from food consumed has not plateaued in your bloodstream and still is on the rise.Proper test times are:1. Fasting - 8-10 hours no food or colored liquids, usually done first thing in morning.2. Preprandial - Before meal to get a baseline measurement3. Postprandial - 2-3 hours after a meal to see how foods consumed affected glucose levels.4. Bedtime - Going to bed with high glucose means 1/3rd of your day is spent with above normal levels. Also a good reference to compare against morning fasting level.Your 2 hour reading of 88 mg/dl appears to be normal. Check at 3 hours to be certain you're not experiencing hypoglycemia.Lastly, avoid white rice as it turns into sugar after eating.",

            "answer": "I've been reading one of Dr. Bernstein's books. I think he mentions a post-prandial limit of 120, but that may be two or three hours after eating. Somewhere I recall hearing that blood sugar over 200 at any time is classified as diabetes and that at that level glucose is likely to spill into the urine. Hence my concern.",

            "answer": "Well, kinda sorta. Let me attempt to clear your misunderstanding.For t2 diabetics a postprandial level of 120 mg/dl is optimum. This is does not hold true for normal ppl. Postprandial levels for a normal ppl are normal fasting levels, 60/70 - 99 mg/dl.If you remove the words \"at anytime\" it would be considered true. Random testing [at anytime] is useless as it only provides false/positives. Excess glucose over a period of time is expelled by the kidneys into the urine. Sugar in urine, however, can mean other things beside diabetes.I suggest you see your care provider and ask for an A1c [HbA1c, HgbA1c, HA1c] test. Currently, the A1c is the gold standard in testing for determining type 2 diabetes.",

            "answer": "Technically 2 readings like yours indicates type 2. A1c will only give you an average. It will not account for spikes very well and that is where the damage occurs.I have prediabetes and have never been over 190 no matter when I test.A person with a perfect pancreas would rarely go above 120 anytime at all.",

    "question": "I've been monitoring my blood sugar in the last couple of months because of increasing Hba1c levels, though my highest overnight fasting level was 89. Thought I was doing pretty well -- my highest 1 hour post prandial reading had been 140 -- until this afternoon. One hour after eating a tray of takeout sushi from the grocery store I got a reading of 236, immediately followed by a reading of 244 (to make sure it wasn't a machine error). Two hours, some aloe vera juice and a bit of exercise later, it was back down to 88. What does this indicate and how serious is it?",
