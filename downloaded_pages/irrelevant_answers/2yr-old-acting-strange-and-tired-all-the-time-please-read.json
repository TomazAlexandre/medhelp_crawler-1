    "question": "My 2 year old is always very loud, outgoing, and goes until she can't go anymore, but for the last month she has been acting very strange. I have noticed a difference in her behavior and it just worries me. For the first two weeks she was sick with a stomach bug, but ever since she got over that she has been super quiet, lays around all the time, and just isn't her normal self. Others have noticed this as well and I just don't know what it could be. We are taking her to the doctor tomorrow, but I am just afraid he will say she is fine and blow it off. I want him to do a blood test to make sure she doesn't have diabetes (which runs in my family) or something else. Is this too much to ask from my doctor? Am I over reacting? I just feel that I know her better than anyone else and I hate seeing her like this. She is very pale in her face and always has these red circles under her eyes and acts as if she feels awful at times. Normally she would get up around 7-8am and then eat breakfast and play until she would fall over, hardly ever wanting to take a nap and then going until we forced her into bed @ 10 every night. Now she won't get up until 9-10am and will hardly eat anything...when I suggest something she breaks down into tears if that's not what she wants. Then she plays for a little bit taking breaks to lay around on the sofa or in my lap and then plays a little more, then takes a nap @ 1-2 for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours then gets up hardly eats anything for lunch or dinner and goes to bed around 8:30-9pm. She drinks plenty of fluids...too much I think sometimes. And I know that fluids can fill you up, but I will not let her have anything to drink until I know she has at least tried to eat something, but she constantly tells me she isnt' hungry!!!Just wanted thoughts on this or if anyone else has had a child act like this please let me know;)Thanks!!!!",
