            "answer": "The dangers of cannabis are underrated.\u00a0\u00a0I took it up when I was 16 cos I thought it was cool and helped me find a peer group and be creative and just about everything and over time I became addicted to it. It took a long time and effort and the help of a 12 step program to stop using it. And, as any addict will attest - addiction is life long. So if you take it up and it becomes habitual then its got you - you aint got it - kiss your freedom goodbye.For me - it didnt make me cool -it made me mad. It didnt make me creative it made me obsessive- my cannabis use continued for years after the peer group had gone and I never found another one - I was alone in the company of my cannabis.Cannabis use aged me but at the same time stopped me growing up. It stopped me enjoying the best years of my life. It damaged my lungs. It stopped me reaching my potential. It gave me high blood pressure. Rather than popular myths it is\u00a0\u00a0more dangerous than tobacco. They put all the chemicals in the world in modern marijuana- herbicides, fungicides and most people mix it with tobacco anyway.I could go on about\u00a0\u00a0dangers of using cannabis. There are no benefits.\u00a0\u00a0Any perceived appeal is superficial and any perceived rewards are shallow. Dont do it. Do something else - talk to your friends that dont use and try to enjoy your life - while you can.",

            "answer": "Dear dand what kind of proof or experience do you have of that ? How you can attest that putting chemicals and carcinogens into your lungs is \" very good for you\" beggars belief !If you like getting stoned then at least be informed enough to admit you are aware of the dangers and choose to kill yourself/shorten your life slowly with a poison - because it is your lifestyle choice. But dont draw others into it - it will be on your conscience as it is on a drug pusherI advise all smokers to go to http://whyquit.com. or simliar - there is nothing good about smoking. Nothing at all. In fact it is very dangerous and addictive and counterproductive to a happy healthy life.",

            "answer": "I'm kind of sick of American's bashing on this because it's an illegal drug so \"it must be bad for you\". This is in fact incorrect. Do you're own research. Check out many different sites. Sure you're correct smoking it is not healthy for you because you're putting harmful carbons into your lungs, but if you cook it into things (research recipes) then the TCH is in fact good for you. It helps stabilize blood sugars (Proven by experience and researchers), lowers blood pressure (it causes your body to relax), and it even helps build neurons in your brain specially if eaten with bananas. Only thing to keep in mind is check your blood sugar before you intake the TCH because sometimes you will feel low (because you feel \"hunger\" when you think of food) and remember to take insulin for the food you eat when you're high. Just use common sense with your diabetes.",

            "answer": "I take your point that you can cook it. But this is not easy and the original poster was 16 yrs old! Its also messy - what kitchen would she use? What if she has baby sisters and they pick up a cookie? You wanna be responsible for that? Think about it!The effects of the THC cooked or smoked will still increase your heartrate to abnormal levels - and you cant get a heart easily. You've only got one. Take care of it.I disagree that it lowers blood pressure. I got hypertension - from using it. I used to take my BP after using it and the systolic and dystolic was through the roof. Sure when you come down - it comes down too - but it wont be long till using agin and up it will go again - guess what after enough use - it stays there. Just like the desire to use.As well as that when stoned your social skills and brain, physical, athletic, emotional and cognitive functioning becomes severley impaired. and the effects last longer than what you know. After enough use the impairment doesnt go away. Just like the desire to use.And the worst part is that when using you dont know when you cross that critical point - its somewhere near going from a recreational user to a habitual user. It just happens. If you dont understand dont worry - keep using - its in the post for you....Theres a reason its called wasted. Look at what is being wasted - everything!\u00a0\u00a0Look at what you are gaining - nothing !By the way I'm not American and I wouldnt care less if its legal or illegal in your state. I'm not judging its use - I'm using my own experiences to advise against it. I wish someone had've done that for me......but there was no internet for us then. Just a surfing community and a love of getting wasted. The irony is we got so wasted and asthmatic we couldnt surf anymore. LOL That was silly. But we knew no better.I'm also not diabetic - so I dont know what you have to go through there - and I'm sure its not easy - and I apologise if I have offended those suffering diabetes but I suggest that you find other ways of coping through fine friends, food and clean living. Take care of yourself and others.I repeat if you want to use then do so - but make it known that is your lifestyle choice and that you accept the risks. Whatever happens dont advise young people to use. Whatever country surely that is legally, morally and socially unacceptable. It'll be on our conscience should they ever suffer because you OK drug use.",

Just look at your nick for example, \"life sux then you die\"? it seems to me that you have a very negative outlook on life to begin with, and maybe it is yourself that is pulling you down and damaging your physical and mental health, not the herb. Herb is for the healing of the balance in you. But nevertheless, I respect your opinion and point of view!Haile Bless",

I started smoking MJ about 4 years ago and started noticing my sugar dropping about 20 minutes later every time that I would smoke.\u00a0\u00a0The key is to only smoke a very small amount because you don't want to be in a situation where your high and lose track of your blood sugar levels. Also you have to have control when it comes to eating too much food or eating junk food afterwards because this will cause High Blood Sugars.\u00a0\u00a0It really is something that you must get down to a science or it just won't be good for you. Also you have to take into consideration the legality of it.\u00a0\u00a0PS> be careful",
