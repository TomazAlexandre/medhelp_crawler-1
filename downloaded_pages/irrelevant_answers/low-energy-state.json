            "answer": "HiWelcome to the forum!Low on energy, hungry, losing weight etc all are possible in diabetes. Get your blood sugar level checked. Also there is a chance that you have acidity or IBS or Crohn\u2019s disease or Celiac disease. Alternate loose stools and constipation is possible in all these cases.Your gut issues can be responsible for malnutrition due to poor absorption. Please discuss these possibilities with your doctor. You may need a referral to a gastroenterologist.Hope this helps. Do let me know if there is any thing else and keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 28 years man, telecom engineer by profession. My problem is that i have very low energy when i getup in the morning. I feel as low in energy that it is harder for me to firstly move me out of the bed. I use to observe a swelling on my face and after a bath my face and skin becomes extremely dull and dry. Very important symptom is that when my stomic is empty i feel cool and relaxed as soon as i eat something a condition of restlessness and discomfort starts in my head and whole body specially in head and limbs. Often i use to have loose stool and sometimes constipation as well. I eat three meals a day and a good amout of food each time but I dont gain weight, instead getting slimmer and slimmer. At the same time i have a good hunger, if i miss even one of my meals i start becoming mad of hunger. Another important point is that my low energy state improves down the day and after dinner i becomes good in energy. But slowly down energy state is expanding its span over the whole day. I often remains absent from my office, I could not prepare myself to do work and remains in my room all the time. Kindly help me as this is becoming very difficult for me and my hopes started weaking even i had always been a hopefull man.Best regards,",
