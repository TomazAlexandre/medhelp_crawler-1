I'm a long-time Type 1, and not a medical professional.Some possibly relevant facts you haven't mentioned include how well your blood sugar is staying within your target range.\u00a0\u00a0While your diet & lifestyle sound quite healthy, it's important for you to keep your BG wihtin the target range.\u00a0\u00a0Excessive periods of high blood sugar can cause weight loss because the calories are excreted in the urine.\u00a0\u00a0Review your BG results with your doc.Many of us with auto-immune diabetes (Type 1, that is) also have thyroid issues.\u00a0\u00a0I notice that you're taking synthroid.\u00a0\u00a0Hvae you doc check your levels in your next blood test to be sure that that's okay, too.\u00a0\u00a0Outofwhack thyroids can cause weight changes, too.Lipitor is used to control cholesterol and while I've read that some folks get muscle aches from it.\u00a0\u00a0There is a blood test (tho' I don't recall its name) that can help detect \"muscle wasting.\"\u00a0\u00a0It's ideal to get a baseline (before starting the cholesterol med) to have a reading with which to compare the \"after using\" readings.\u00a0\u00a0The reading can also be skewed by any recent bruises or injuries.\u00a0\u00a0Again, tell your doc your concerns &, especially if you have generalized muscle aches, ask your doc about this test.Finally, talk to your doc about an overall checkup because weight loss may (not) be related to diabetes at all.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes life (& stressors) change our appetite and/or activity very gradually, but over time, the effects accumulate.\u00a0\u00a0This is true both for unwanted weight gain & weight loss.",

            "answer": "I agree on the thyroid level. I take Synthroid as well and was stable on the same dose for many years. Since my diabetes diagnosis my thyroid level keeps destabilizing-both hyper and hypo so it's important to have regular TSH tests to make sure you are in target range. Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss; other symptoms are being warm all the time, anxiety/agitation and diahrrea.",

    "question": "My height is 5,6\" and I had been maintaining my weight between 55 kg, to 59 kg for the last 10 years. Its looks to me that I am losing my fat and muscles after being on metformin and asprin which I started in November 2004. I had been on Synthroid on last 18 years and lipitor (10 mg) for last 4 years. The dose of metformin is 300mg, 1 tablet 3 times a day. Synthroid is 125 (micro-mg) 1 tablet a day. I take my Synthroid early in the morning and metmorphin after meals and lipitor in the night. It looks like for the last 3-4 months my weight has come to 55kg. I think last year my weight was 59kg. So what could be the reason for my weight loss? I walk everyday, my diet is good and healthy, my times for eating meals are very much on time, I am a strict vegetarian, milk, once a week tofu are the main sources of protiens. There are almonds, veggies, and fruits are included in my diet. Though my own business needs a lot of physical work too, but has been for 10 years. So what is the reason for my weight loss. I am really worried. I dont feel tired. Could you please answer me as soon as possible. Thank you.-Worried wife and me",
