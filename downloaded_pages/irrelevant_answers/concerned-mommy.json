            "answer": "Im not sure about the cramping but as long as theres no bleeding associated with it that's a good sign..as far as only gaining one pound, well i lost11 pounds this pregnancy in the beginning. It want till about 5 months that i started putting on weight and i was average size to begin with. It worried me too but as long as you are eating enough your baby will take what it needs from your resereves. I know its really hard when you feel sick to even think about eating. My nausea and food aversions were so bad the first months i was in bed almost all day.it was rare to even think of anything i wanted to eat.",
