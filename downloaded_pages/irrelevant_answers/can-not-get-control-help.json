            "answer": "Luna,We're not physicians here, but all of us have considerable experience with diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0As a fellow diabetic, also a long timer, I must tell you that we have no alternative as Type 1s but to take our insulin and any other meds we've been prescribed.\u00a0\u00a0The symptoms you describe are dangerous -- not just for you -- but for your child, who is dependent on you for his complete care.Our forum has a \"sister\" initiative also sponsored by JDRF and I *urge* you to contact them.\u00a0\u00a0Called the Online Diabetes Support Team (ODST), there is a link to it off the main JDRF website:\u00a0\u00a0www.jdrf.org\u00a0\u00a0ODST is set up to put you in contact with folks who are local to you **AND** there is a person there who is quite knowledgeable about insurance & supplies issues in each state here in the US.\u00a0\u00a0There may well be resources to help you with the enormous financial cost of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0When (not if ;-)\u00a0\u00a0)\u00a0\u00a0you contact ODST, please tell them we (JDRF's MedHelp forum) sent you.I imagine that you are scared in addition to feeling so poorly.\u00a0\u00a0If you have *any* supplies, talk to your doc about how to stretch them safely to get out of the danger you are in.\u00a0\u00a0High levels of sustained urine ketones may be the \"tip of the iceberg.\"\u00a0\u00a0It seems to me that whatever you are doing is not working and only a medical doctor skilled in Type 1 care can guide you to better match your food, exercise, stress, health issues with your body's need for insulin.Please do NOT delay in turning around your situation.\u00a0\u00a0Be persistent; do it for your son, if not for yourself.",

            "answer": "Dear luna25,I am not a physician, but a volunteer with knowledge of living with my son's diabetes for 21 years. LRS has given you the very best information and I urge you to follow up on these resources and advice.My son is 29 and has had type 1 for 21 years. During his younger years he also did not take the best of care of his blood sugars. At 22, he started having similar syptoms that you have described. He was diagnosed with a complication called gastroparesis. This is a problem where the stomach is not able to move food through the intestines. A normal stomach moves about 3 times a minute. Someone with gastroparesis has a slowing of the stomach and is unable to digest food properly. This can cause vomiting, nausea, stomach pain,weight loss and erratic blood sugars.Due to the type of symptoms, this is not what most doctors immediately think of. This can be diagnosed and treated through diet and medications. The main diagnostic tool is called a radioisotope gastric-emptying scan. It is a fairly simple test that would confirm gastroparesis. I would also like to give you a website that has more information. It is http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/gastroparesis.luna, there can be many reasons for your symptoms and I am only suggesting one possible cause. My concern is that your vomiting and stomach pain is not normal and you need a firm diagnoses.From your post it is obvious that money and insurance is an issue. I completely understand your situation. The work issue is something my son has gone through also. It is a terrible situation, especially when you are raising a child. Again, you need to follow LRS's advice regarding contacting ODST. I would also stress that if you end up in ER, to suggest the possibility of gastroparesis and no matter what, do not leave if you are vomiting. I know that my son always needs fluids by an IV to rehydrate.Please let us know what you find out.dm",

            "answer": "I had an out of control gastric problem that was brought on by harsh medications and I went through at least 6 types of gastric tests.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that a Barium scan would also show up symptoms of gastro-paresis.\u00a0\u00a0They believed that I had that for a long time, but it was irritation to the stomach/GI tract from medications that were too harsh for me.\u00a0\u00a0The kidneys get sore when I get dehydrated badly and they seem to get sore when I have GI symptoms - but there is also some contracting going on so this may be part of it.\u00a0\u00a0Try soothing your GI tract with DGL (licorice that has been treated to remove palpitation side effect) or by eating easy-to-digest things.\u00a0\u00a0Try yogurt and Slippery Elm and soups and other things that just slither through rather than things that take a lot of digestive work like popcorn.\u00a0\u00a0Also, I chewed Equal type of gum - sugarless - it has some kind of mild laxative in it and that can help get things flowing the right way.\u00a0\u00a0In the hospital, when this happens, they use enemas to induce the GI tract into flowing the right direction.\u00a0\u00a0I am just a diabetic with a broad base of injuries/treatment and so this is not professional.\u00a0\u00a0However, doctors are back in the middle ages with gastric symptoms and they will test your kidneys and liver and nothing will appear and they will call it Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) because that is the tag they use.\u00a0\u00a0Try supplementing with multiple vitamin, extra C and E and Glutamine (helps stomach tissues heal) and Essential Fatty Acid - EFA - supplement to get your Omega 3's in your diet again - also a teaspoon or more of Olive Oil (extra virgin) 3 times a day (preferably in your food).\u00a0\u00a0Good luck - sounds like you should start measuring your carbs better and take better care of yourself!\u00a0\u00a0Eventually, it will pay off by fewer doctor visits.",
