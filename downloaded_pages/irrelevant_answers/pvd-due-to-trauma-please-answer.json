            "answer": "The chance of you getting a RD from that injury are small probably on the order of 1 in 1000 or less given the normal exam. A PVD is a normal part of an eye ageing and at your age roughly 30% of myopes have some degree of PVD.\u00a0\u00a0A PVD does not affect the vision other than often causing an increase of floaters.\u00a0\u00a0Because these injuries are all different there are no standardized studies and statistics. If you have sudden increase of new floaters, flashes of light or loss of peripheral vision you should return immediately to the ophthalmologist.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0JCH MD",

            "answer": "Thank you most heartily for the prompt answer! I did present my ophthalmologist with my symptoms which were a couple of new floaters which oddly enough turned out to be 'asteroid hyalosis' and ONLY in the eye that experienced the trauma. As for other symptoms, I never experienced flashes per se, but when I would look at a TV in a dark room, go from a well lit room to a dimly lit room AND when waking up in the morning I would experience a shimmer in my nasal peripheral with open eyes for a half a second. When I would close my eyes I would also see an anomalous phosphene in the shape of a truncated oval terminating at the nasal peripheral. If there was strong back-lighting behind my CLOSED eyes it would present as an oily black looking truncated oval shape. These symptoms persist except the shimmering has mostly diminished in the TV room and when going from dim to light rooms or vice versa. I mentioned all of this to my ophthalmologist. He then examined me and made the PVD diagnosis.I guess the thing that got me concerned was that I was reading one retina specialist's website and he was mentioning that the vitreous in younger eyes is firmer than in older eyes and with their being trauma that the likelihood of retinal complication was much higher than in those in older patients. Anyway, I hope you are right about the 1 in 1000 things. You really seem to know your stuff and again I deeply appreciate taking the time to answer our questions!",

            "answer": "Asteroid hyalosis is a benign condensation of small yellow refractile bodies in the vitreous. It did not occur due to the trauma but was discovered during the exam. Use Google Images and see what it looks like. It's really beautiful and like a small galaxy within the eye.Your changes of coming out of this with good vision are excellent. Make sure you don't have another trauma to your eye.\u00a0\u00a0Work and play safe.JCH MD",

Use Google Images and see what it looks like. Really beautiful and looks like a galaxy within the eye.\u00a0\u00a0I believe that you have misinterpreted the difference of young vs old.\u00a0\u00a0In fact the vitreous being firmer gives the retina more support. Young people have more work or sport or fight related trauma than older people. In any case most people do very well. Be careful not to injure your eye again!\u00a0\u00a0JCH MD",

            "answer": "As for the hyalosis, I guess the peculiar thing is that it was only found in the right, injured eye. My other eye only had regular floaters. My ophthalmologist also said asteroid hyalosis was not associated with the injury. Furthermore, he mentioned that it COULD be associated with diabetes or high cholesterol. If it is suggestive of a systemic issue like that why would it only appear in one eye? To note, my last cholesterol screening was within reference ranges and though I haven't had my a1c or fasting blood sugar check, I have none of the signs of diabetes or pre-diabetes.",

            "answer": "Sorry, what I meant to say about that was that the retina specialist's website was claiming that the vitreous was more firmly ATTACHED to the retina and would cause more pulling in younger eyes. Sorry for the misquote. This stuff is a beast to talk about and I am not good with accurately conveying details. Either way, that notion of the vitreous being more firmly attached is the provenance of much of my concern.",

In most instances Asteroid is not associated with increased incidence of systemic disease: there is a small over-represenation of diabetes and hypertension and arteriosclerotic vascular disease in people with asteroid.

    "question": "I was recently diagnosed with PVD due to closed ocular trauma and I am very, very concerned about losing my right eye vision despite my ophthalmologist's seeming unconcern. When I came to him, around ten days had elapsed since the trauma, (I know now, I should have gone in sooner) a hard open-handed blow to the head.I was dilated and thoroughly examined and the PVD was diagnosed, however visual acuity was normal and their were no signs of retinal detachments, tears, holes or retinal bruises at the time of this examination. I was told to return in six weeks for follow-up.Here is my question: What are the odds of a 36 year old male with no other eye issues progressing to retinal damage complications of any sort from this trauma? What is the likelihood that the vitreal fluid will complete detachment without involving the retina or other problems? I tried asking my eye doc this, but he wouldn't give me an answer.\u00a0\u00a0What are the numbers based on your experience, statistics and/or the literature. Again, I'm worried sick! I appreciate your time in answering my question!",
