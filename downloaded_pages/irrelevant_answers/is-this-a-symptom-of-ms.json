            "answer": "Hi,I am a type 1 diabetic . One test\u00a0\u00a0they would do is called\u00a0\u00a0an A1C test which actually will give an average of your blood sugar readings over the last 3 months. Anything 6.0 and under is considered non- diabetic or if your like me and already are a diabetic and score that low it means you are well controlled. There are some other blood tests that they do I would ask my Dr. about them if your that concerned. Also your blood fasting would be an indicator as well. depending on the lab that takes your blood your fasting should be between 70/ 120.\u00a0\u00a0Although some Dr.s think 120 is to high for a fasting, they might see that number and think your borderline diabetic. My Dr. thinks a reading of 140 for a fasting is considered borderline. I am not sure why your concerned about diabetes do you have family history of diabetes? You would have more than the symptoms that you mentioned like frequent urination and extreme thirst, the constant craving for sugary foods. My vision got blurry but when that happened I was very sick and my blood sugars were in the 500's and that was a fasting blood sugar reading. When I was put in the hospital for my diabetes (when I first got DX) the Ophthomologist was able to tell that my vision was blurry from the high sugars, they said it was from all the sugar in my blood stream causing my vision to get funny But it didn't just go away , it took one week in the hospital of insulin injections before my vision got better. Thankfully I have never had that problem since then and that was 12 years ago. But I am on insulin, and I have never been that sick with my diabetes since then Thank God. again I am not to clear on why your concerned about diabetes , but if you have any more questions feel free to ask.God BlessCindi",

            "answer": "Yes I do have other symptoms, thirst, and frequent bathroom visits. My maternal grandmother was diabetic (insulin injections). I also get skin rashes on my nose , chin and near my eye that come and go. I have never had this problem in the past. When all this started I was very sick- flu like symptoms and fatigue that continued for two months. But I also get -off and on slight tingling and weakness\u00a0\u00a0in my hands and tingling in one foot (I don't think this is typical of diabetes??) My diet at that time was not good. 1 meal a day and lots of junk fast foods.Thank you for telling me the type of tests that I should ask for. My family Dr. did the routine blood tests when I first went to see him and said it was not diabetes or B12. But since I don't know what is wrong with me I guess I should check it out. Thanks again.",

    "question": "First of all let me say thank you to the wonderful people on this forum. I have posted questions before and have received great advise. It is comforting to get answers to questions.I have been through several tests and have not yet received a dx. My neuro says it is not ms.So what the heck is it? I still think it is. I went back to him. He is sending me for a evoked potential (I think just to keep me happy)Went back to the family doctor and he checked for Lupus. Tests came back O.K.Anyways- my question is this- has anyone experienced jumpy/jerky vision? I had this for 2 weeks- kind of like watching the scenery going by while looking out the window of a moving train. Ophthomologist says that there is nothing wrong with my eyes. She sees no evidence of ON. Although I've read that it could be further back in the brain. I don't know if this would have showed on my MRI. After the two weeks of this jerky vision, it stopped, but my eyes feel heavy and tired (for the last 4 months) The strange thing is that the jerky movements temporarily returned 2 times immediately after drinking a cold sugary drink. This makes me think of diabetes- although my family doctor checked my blood (rointine blood work) I wonder if I should be getting more intense testing for diabetes? I don't know if there are such tests. I am so tired of my eye symptoms. The doctors don't seem to be looking for any answers. I live in Canada with doctor shortages, so maybe the doctors are concentrating on more seriously ill patients.I had my MRI in the U.S. Only a 2 day wait compared to a 2 month wait in Canada. If I take all my medical records for a consultation in the U.S. what kind of doctor should I see?? Once again thank you in advance for any advise.",
