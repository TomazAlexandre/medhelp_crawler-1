            "answer": "That's pretty tough to answer just based on that information.\u00a0\u00a0It's true that our fertility starts to decrease a bit at 35, but getting pregnant at 35+ is certainly not uncommon.\u00a0\u00a0If your cycles are regular, your ovulating, etc. those things help.\u00a0\u00a0You won't know until you try.\u00a0\u00a0Before I started trying to conceive I had a complete physical (I was 37) which is always a good thing.\u00a0\u00a0Your Dr. can give you his or her advice/opinion as to things you can do to increase your chances.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "i weigh 212lbs with a bmi of 37.\u00a0\u00a0My partner and i were referred to a fertiltiy specialist as after 28 months of ttc it wasn't happening, we have been told we are both fine but i have to get my bmi down to at least 30 i have to lose 40lbs to give me a better chance of conceiveing on my own and i'm only 24 years old.My advice is to try and lose weight while you are ttc, no it's not always a problem for some people ttc but with others like myself it could be a factor that needs sorting.\u00a0\u00a0Best of luck to you and i hope you see the BFP soon!!",

            "answer": "Hello, thank you for posting.\u00a0\u00a0I would not not say it would be difficult to become pregnant based on your age, moreso on your weight.\u00a0\u00a0As Adgal said, it is difficult to answer based on the limited info you provided.\u00a0\u00a0So, please forgive my bluntness, but 324lbs is considered morbid obesity...you may develop a myriad of health issues if you became pregnant, including high blood pressure, gestational diabetes, back problems or cardiac concerns.\u00a0\u00a0On top of your current weight, you will gain even more weight being pregnant--quite an uncomfortable state for Mom and baby to be in\u00a0\u00a0I would try to lose some weight, slowly and with a healthy approach.\u00a0\u00a0Have you talked with your Dr about this?\u00a0\u00a0Although 35, you still have several years to conceive and have a baby if you so desire, that's the good news!\u00a0\u00a0I wish you luck and success, and please keep us posted if you get a BFP!",
