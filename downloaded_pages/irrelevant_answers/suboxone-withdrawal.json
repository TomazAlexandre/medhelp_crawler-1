            "answer": "Hi there and welcome. Your story is a great example of what happens when people put the drugs down but don't do anything for aftercare. This difference between getting clean and STAYING clean is working a program. We can't do this alone, and trust me, we all tried, just as you did. Get into meetings asap, NA or AA and you will see your life change.Stay close to this site, too. Great people will be chiming in.",

            "answer": "I'm so sorry that you are feeling awful. I have been on suboxone for over a year and have tried to quit on my own a few times. It's absolutely the most horrible withdrawal I have ever felt..and I have withdrawn from ALOT of nasty stuff. I hate that you r doing this while having to care for your little ones. It's really not possible and I suggest that you check into a detox center. The withdrawal is scary and can make a.person feel totally lost and suicidal. Is there anyone that can watch your kids while you get clean?? This is a perfect time to get a medical detox and then plugged into an aftercare program. You can't do this alone. I am going to RDD in Michigan next month so that I can finally quit, but most hospitals can help you detox comfortably and safely. Don't stay silent. Good to reach out like this. You are in my prayers. I'm happy to answer any other questions also.",

    "question": "I went to detox this time last year for a 5 day detox for use of pills for years..I felt fine coming home for about a month and then started hanging back out with the same people and so forth and said to myself 1 pill won't hurt then it moves to 2 and you know where I'm going from here. I started trying new drugs when my middle son was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes a couple months ago. I started doing coke on and off to stay awake because my nerves were so tore up from worrying about my middle son and then got back into pill and one day was like what am I doing so I knew a person who had suboxone and I could buy some to detox myself at home from pills. I did good at first and once I would run out I would buy more and more and finally funds start running short because it cost a lot to buy subs from someone and so I was like let me cut them down a couple days and I will be fine. I have been without subs for 3 days now and today has been horrible and I am assuming it's sub withdrawal. The last 2 days I have felt fine and then this morning I woke up no energy and nauseated feel like I'm over heating then sweating and feel like I'm going to have a panic attack I am wondering if it is from sub withdrawal I am assuming it is because this is why I kept going back to subs but I want this time to be the last and I'm scared I really am. I have to take care of 3 kids and its scary going through this and wondering if anyone else has tips about things that help and so forth. Thank you for reading and any info will be great\u00a0\u00a0so tired of fighting with drugs people do not realize how quickly you become addicted to something until it's to late.",
