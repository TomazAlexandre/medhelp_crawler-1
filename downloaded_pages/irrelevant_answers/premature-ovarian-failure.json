            "answer": "Hello,Premature ovarian failure occurs when your ovaries-which store and release eggs-stop working before age 40. There is no way to prevent premature ovarian failure. Women with premature ovarian failure have a higher risk of bone thinning and fractures (osteoporosis), diabetes, and heart disease. A balanced and low-fat diet, regular exercise, and not smoking can help protect your bones and heart.It is very difficult to precisely confirm a diagnosis without examination and investigations and the answer is based on the medical information provided. For exact diagnosis, you are requested to consult your doctor. I sincerely hope that helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing.",
