            "answer": "Without seeing the scans, I can not provide an accurrate opinion. Based on the statements you have provided, it appears that both MRI's are showing the same results. There is no mention of contrast which would be useful is differentiating between demyelination and vascular causes. Based on these MRI's alone, since there is no clinical history, an evaluation for demyelinating diseases (for example MS), vascular risk factors, vasculitis, and inflammatory disorders of the CNS should be evaluated. Nothing described on these scans would specifically point to dementia. You should discuss this with your neurologist who will be able to review the films and provide more specific answers. Good luck.",

            "answer": "There is nothing in the tests you have mentioned which excludes MS as a possibility. Given the predominant arm symptoms, it is reasonable to have a MRI of the cervical spine as well. MCV is a good institution, and should be able to help you. Good luck.",

Non-specific supratentorial white matter disease is present in both cerebral hemispheres.\u00a0\u00a0There is no involvement of the posterior fossa structures at this time, and no indication of abnormal parenchymal or leptomeningeal hemorrhage.\u00a0\u00a0Differential diagnosis, in this age group, is most strongly considered for small vessel ischemic vasculopathy such as that related to hypertension or diabetes, vasculopathic changes that could be related to inflammatory vasculitis such as Lyme",
