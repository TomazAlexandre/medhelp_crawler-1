            "answer": "Hi there,If you normally get your Rx from the same pharmacy, I would ask to talk with the senior pharmacist or manager at that location and ask if they would be willing to deeply discount your Rx for this interim period.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes, they have a bit of flexibility and are willing to accommodate a regular customer who's in a bind.Also check to find a local chapter/branch of Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF) and give them a call.\u00a0\u00a0They might have access to resources that can help you thru the transition.\u00a0\u00a0Visit the JDRF website (www.jdrf.org) and navigate to CHAPTERS to snoop around.",
