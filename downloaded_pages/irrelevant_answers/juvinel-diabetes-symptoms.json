            "answer": "If the body is not able to appropriately use the sugars in food because it cannot produce insulin, then a craving for foods with carbohydrates can result. I would suggest that you look to see if other typical symptoms of diabetes is present: thirst, going to the bathroom an unusual amount of times, lethargy, irritability (noticed in children), 'fruity' smelling breath, sleepy, hungry all the time, and weight loss even though the child is eating a lot. If in doubt, I would certainly get him tested. Better to have the simple lab test done than to guess.",
