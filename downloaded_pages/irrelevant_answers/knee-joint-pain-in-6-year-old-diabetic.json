            "answer": "My son too. He is not diabetic but over the last year or even longer has complained of knee pain. It is waking him up at nite. I have had x rays and several trips to the Dr. Even blood work and nothing. My husband said they look weird and wants to consult a specialist. It does not seem right at all...he is only 3 years old! I will be calling the dr again!",

    "question": "my 6-year-old was diagnosed at age 2 with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0i am concerned because she consistently complains of pain in her knees, often crying and waking up at night from it.\u00a0\u00a0she is a very tough kid and rarely registers pain, so it must be bad.\u00a0\u00a0these episodes come every couple months and last for a week or two then subside.i know some kids get really bad growing pains and i hope that's what these are.\u00a0\u00a0but i can't help worrying that they could be a sign of lupus.\u00a0\u00a0two adult friends who have it tell me they had terrible joint pain in their knees growing up but never knew why.\u00a0\u00a0with diabetes, she is already at higher risk for another auto-immune disease like lupus.\u00a0\u00a0anybody have any experience or comments?hopefully worried over nothing,thanks!",
