            "answer": "Hip injuries, especially breaks, can often be major, and life-changeing events in the elderly. A hip replacement is a very demanding procedure on the body, and requires a very healthy and strong body for a quick and complete recovery. Usually people who break their hips at the age of your mother-in-law do not completely recover, and if complications do arise in the hospital, discharge can take a considerable amount of time. Like a said, it can be a life-changeing event. MRSA is a very serious kind of staph infection becoming more and more common in present day. It can often occur in hospitals, especially after surgery, and especially in the elderly, AND especially in a diabetic, as hospitals are a great place for bacteria to reside and be transferred from one patient to the next. Diabetes can complicated would healing and right now your mother-in-law's immune system and body's defense system is probably not up to par, considering it just went through a very traumatic operation. Fluid retention can be a common thing when a patient is bedbound for a long time such as 4 months. Fluid builds up in the body and just sits there, which is why your mother-in law is on lasix, a diuretic. I'm sure the doctors at the hospital are monitoring all organ functions, including kidneyfunction,so they do know what is going on with her and are watching her closely. Do they draw labs/blood every day? Back to the MRSA, this infection can reek havok on the body, especially in a large wound and in a frail person. IV antibiotics are the best treatment possible, and if she's been on them for 8 weeks, hopefully the infection is resolved by now. The MRSA would explain the weakness, chills, and sweating, and loss of appetite, but the surgeries contribute to the weight loss and weakness a well. A weight loss is common for elderly patients who enter the hospital for long periods of time after undergoing procedures such as this. I would, at this point, have faith in the doctors in that they are taking care of her and doing their best to get her well and out of the hospital and home again. After going through this it will take a considerable amount of rehabilitation and a lengthy recovery period to recooperate however. In hospitals, nurses and doctors watch their patients very closely and are usually very on top of things. If it seemslike thedoctorsdon't knowwhat's going on, it's most likely because they're not taking the time to explain anything to you guys, which doctors can be infamous for. What I suggest is the next time the doctor comes to check in, being assertive and asking him a list of questions you had previously written down, telling him you need to know some things now. If you have a list of questions prepared, it will be easier for you both to communicate. Right now, your mother-in-law needs an advocate, and you guys, her family, are it. Don't take no for an answer from the doctors, you are the family, you have the right to know and the doctor can take a few minutes to talk to you-don't expect anything like a 30 minute session though. This website is always here as a resource if you have any questions or need support, so use us! I wish you all the best of luck, and send my best wishes to your mother-in-law, wishing a speedy recovery. Take care!Sara RN :)",

            "answer": "Thank you for your comments. We are meeting with patient coordinator today loaded with questions. I have seen elderly patients break their hip and go down hill fast but this was back in the 70's when my mother was a nurse in a nursing home and I worked there part time when I was in school. I guess things haven't changed much. The hip bone is connected to everything.Thanks,Tim",

            "answer": "I'm so glad you are meeting with the patient coordinator. They have more time than doctors and can certainly answer some of your questions, although they do not have medical knowledge like a doctor does. Yes, unfortunately I guess much has not changed since the 70's; hips are a very sensitive place in the body. I'm glad you folks are being proactive and I hope you get all the answer to the questions that you need. Good luck, and of course, best wishes to you all.Sara RN :)",

            "answer": "Hi Tnmccoy,How is your mother in law doing?In my experience hip replacements are not life threatening or contraindicated in the majority of 77 year old patients. I have seen great, complete recoveries. If it were not so, no orthopedic surgeon would under take these procedures. These surgeries have become commonplace and have been perfected.Complications do occur.....at any age. Granted your MIL has some medical conditions that may hamper her recovery....but don't give up. This may be a long process but don't lose hope.Yes much has changed since the 70's. The hardware being implanted has greatly improved as have the medications and approaches used to treat complications. The medical community has progressed.MRSA (Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus Aureusis) a serious complication. It is resistant to many ATB's (antibiotic).\u00a0\u00a0It generally contracted in hospitals and similar facilities. The chills and sweating is most likely due to the elevated temp and her bodies response to fight off the bacteria. Diabetes does complicate her condition.I am hoping you will update us. What was the results of the meeting with the patient coordinator?\u00a0\u00a0The process may be long but I am hoping for a complete recovery for your MIL.Best of Luck to your MIL and family,~Tuck",

    "question": "I am not sure if this is the correct forum but here goes. My 77 yr old mother-in-law has been in hospital 4 months since breaking her hip. Several set backs have kept her there. Had THR, then had second surgery to reattach muscles when the attachment point snapped, has diabetes, and is retaining fluid. Has or had, not sure as they have not cultured the fluid since finishing 8 weeks of IV antibiotics, MRSA. The doctors have a pump into the wound to suck out the infection so it can't build up. Trying to get fluid off slowly as to not to damage kidneys. On IV lasic. She is weak and does not have much strength. She is now having chills and is sweating. She has had so much fluid thather skin weeped. She has now started having body shakes. This usually happens on days where she has lost at least 4 KG. Is this the MRSA or just a combination of all her issues? I am trying to help wife understand and I am not sure we are getting the answers or maybe the doctors don\"t know why she is having issues. She was a large women when she broke her hip and now with the fluid she is over 300lbs.",
