            "answer": "It might be a good idea to get back in therapy. Some of us only need it for a short time while others need it much longer. You're stressed, you're having panic attacks so something is going on. I would think there's a lot to talk about.Yes, getting tested for diabetes is an easy test. Can you get in to see your Dr soon to have that done?",

    "question": "Ok so back in March I practically had a nervous breakdown and had to take several weeks off work. I was stressed out, going through a break up. I'm 26 years old, been having anxiety attacks since middle school. Up until the break up, I've never felt so out of control of my whole body! For the first time during my anxiety attacks, I was feeling tingly/numb throughout my arms and legs, and severe cotton mouth, along with the other symptoms I usually had like tight chest, tunnel vision, dizziness, etc. Doctor just says I have anxiety and thought I was depressed. I tried several anti depressants and it made me so much worse, which is why I had to take time off work. The ex and I were still in contact up until a few weeks ago. It stressed me out but I never felt anxiety over it. This time around I knew being separate was the best thing to do. But then today I had a massive anxiety attack out of no where. I've been taking a natural medicine called Anxietin, which has helped me this whole time. Today when I was having the attack, I took the medicine and for the first time it didn't help! It made me panic even more and it then lasted twice as long as normal. I can't help but to think maybe it's not anxiety, but something medically wrong, like diabetes? I have all the same symptoms when I have anxiety. I am a fit, healthy woman, but I am terrible at dieting. I work out for the sole purpose of eating whatever I want, which includes a lot of sugar. Which is why I'm wondering if its Diabetes? What do you guys think? Is this really just anxiety, or could it be something more??",
