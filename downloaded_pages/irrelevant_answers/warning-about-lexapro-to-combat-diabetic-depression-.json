    "question": "This is just personal experience - but I have found out a lot of endo's have started the practice of prescribing Lexapro to help with the psychological trauma of being newly diagnosed with Diabetes.A lot of times, the endo's do not know (or have not researched into) that Lexapro in fact has some serious nasty side effects - although the maker (Forest Pharmaceutical) says there is no risk of addition or side effects.If you can avoid it - do so.\u00a0\u00a0Even in the 10mg form it can cause you more grief and depression if used over a period of time.\u00a0\u00a0It has a very bad \"rebound effect\" - since it is a \"specific serotonin reuptake inhibitors\" (or SSRIs) ... it is like Paxil, Zoloft, Effexor, Celexa, Luvox.\u00a0\u00a0The problem is - when you first use it you feel good and it appears that your depression goes away.\u00a0\u00a0After a few weeks though - your body gets used to it and it is no longer effective.\u00a0\u00a0In fact, you may spiral back to an even worse suicidal depression than what you started with.\u00a0\u00a0And you can't stop \"cold turkey\" .... you have to gradually get off it.What happened to me: Insomnia, Somnolence (sleepiness or drowsiness), Dizziness, Increased Sweating, Fatigue, Appetite Decreased, Impairment of Judgment, Confusion, Inability to keep Attention Focused. These side effects were \"constant\" - not just here and there.\u00a0\u00a0I also became more irritable and angry for no reason.\u00a0\u00a0As soon as I got off Lexapro - I returned to normal.This is just a warning to anyone considering allowing their endo to prescribe Lexapro to combat Diabetes Depression/Burn out.",
