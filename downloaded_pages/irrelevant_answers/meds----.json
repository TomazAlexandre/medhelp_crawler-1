            "answer": "Hi, I look after my partner she has MS total incapacity for her but she likes to go the whole hog, This does not mean you will follow, Status Epilepsy.Recently, Diabetes, Peg Feed, Prolonged Blind Bouts, Yes! Trigeminal and of course intermittent pain spasms day/night.Yes! we too would love to show her specialist a place where the sun don't shine!After a lot of soul searching and med trials found that in the end they were of little use!, side effects mostly enhanced her fatigue to where she was sleeping most of the day/night, so gradually stopped all meds apart from EP to relieve seizures when experienced. To each their own?No you are not alone, but yes you can become lonely, as \"Rambo\" says when asked how are going to live (I think) replies \"Day by Day\". And we both do. The hardest part is getting the so called professionals to understand, though funny thing though, not at week-ends?She is only a special nursing case, \"Monday to Friday\". That is when we see the specialist nurse.",

    "question": "I have MS and recently diagnosed with TN....Been prescribed neurontin 400mg 3x day.This I have been on for about two months with no help with TN,but has helped with numbness in hands,I have daily headaches along with major pain from eye down to corner of left mandable,,,,with major ringing in ear and pain on the bone behind my ear,,,,all on the left side,I must tell you that this is the most terrible pain I have ever dealt with.It is hard to explain the pain.it comes and goes and at times will stay for a couple hours with such intensity that all I can do is hold my head in a pillow and weep!!! My reg doc did prescribe dilaudid 4mg that only takes some of the pain down to a more comfortable level,My Neurologist has prescribed 400mg of neurontin and said this should in time take it away??two months later I am still dealing with this horrible pain??? I cannot deal with MS and TN together,,,feel like I may as well be dead!! soooo.with the ignorance and self rightousness of my Neurologist who seems to not give a damn,,,,I blame him for what I do!!\u00a0\u00a0BYE,,,,,and god bless the living!",
