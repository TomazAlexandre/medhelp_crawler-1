            "answer": "Hi Jim,Welcome to Senior Health. Please forgive my tardy response. Your question is important to us.If it makes you feel any better your issues are not uncommon. As we age our bodies experience changes that are not always conductive to the active sex life we once enjoyed.First of all are you on any medications such as a high blood pressure medication... or do you have diabetes? Those are just two factors that can interfere with sex drive or the ability to ejaculate.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately you can do little about either condition however there are things that you can do to ease the situation. Impaired circulation for other reasons can also play a part in maintaining an active and satisfying sex life.Obviously the first thing you need to do is determine the reason you sometimes have problems with ejaculation. Not all sexual related issues are due to a physical condition. My best advice would be to consult a urologist.... or your Primary Care Physician.We also have other forums that may be helpful. Here's some links to them:http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Sexual-Health/show/207http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Urology/show/52http://www.medhelp.org/forums/Mens-Health/show/93Don't be embarrassed by your sexual health. It's important to talk freely and have trust in your Physician. I wish you the best and and am\u00a0\u00a0hopeful there are choices to treat your ejaculation concerns.\u00a0\u00a0Please let us know how you are doing.Take Care,~Tuck",
