            "answer": "the \"mole\" is highly unlikely to be contributing to her episodes.\u00a0\u00a0they are most likely unrelated.the way i see it she could possibly be having (in no particular order):1) postural hypotension: does it happen when she sits or stands quickly?2) migrianes: you already knew this3) hypoglycemia: has she had blood workups?\u00a0\u00a0if not, she needs them.having her pupils dilate does not necessarily mean that the episodes are eye related.\u00a0\u00a0i doubt they are \"stress related\" as well.",

    "question": "My 16yr. old daughter has had migraine headaches for several years now. She has to trade meds that she uses with each time she suffers from one, as they do not work as well as they used to. And for about a year now she has been haveing vision blackouts with pain, some dizzyness. She has a mole inside her left eye just under the nerve at the back. Her sight fades out and stay's out for up to 5-10min at any given time. Both eyes go out at the same time for the most part but, its not limited to both sometimes just one eye goes out. When looking at her as this happens, her pupils dialate completly and the color in her eye is all about gone. I have had her checked by both types of eye doctors and am now looking into the Childrens eye care center. Both eye doctors have given her the all clear and say that the mole is just that, a mole. But they have said the other could be just stress related. She has this occure even when she is having a good time,so I tend to disagree at this point. She's had a CT scan about a year ago as I thought this could be related to the brain cancer that her dad had. Thank God it turned out NEG. With these blackouts coming closer together I need some answers. Hoping you can help. Thank youfor your time.",
