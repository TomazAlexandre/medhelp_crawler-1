            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Forehead twitching can be due to eye strain, poor eye sight and other eye problems. Hence consult an eye specialist. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Generally deficiencies of any of the above can cause muscle twitching and spasms in localized or generalized areas of the body. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Since you are under stress, sleep disorders too should be checked.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage. Do discuss this with your doctor and get yourself examined. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I am 32 years old and admit I have been stressing as of late. The last 2 months I have been bothered by these twitches in my forehead and hairline area (Same place everytime), its a couple contractions but happens every 30 minutes or sometimes if I'm lucky a couple of hours. I do have the same crawling and pricking sensations over my body.\u00a0\u00a0I am concerned this is the symtom of a problem not the problem it's self.The twitch is only in the describe area. thank you!",
