            "answer": "You need to rule out hyperthyroidism, candida, leaky gut syndrome, magnesium deficiency and low OR high gastric acid levels (GERD symptoms are identical with either low or high gastric acid levels and antiacid meds should not be taken until this is verified, otherwise your condition may worsen).Insist on the above.If you need a DIY testing/ approach, let me know, however my comments and suggestions are not intended to replace medical advice.Best wishes.Niko",

            "answer": "I agree with theLightSeeker. You have a lot going on. The first thing to do is go and rule out things like hyperthyroidism, diabetes etc.Forget your General Practitioner or PCP. I would hunt for a GREAT endocrinologist. This doctor focuses on hormones and organs like the thyroid and pancreas. Such a doctor will be able to rule many things in or out AND more importantly, will send you for blood and urine tests (to check for many conditions) BUT most importantly he (or she) will CORRECTLY interpret the results. The endocrinologist will interpret FAR FAR better than a PCP or General Practioner could.",

            "answer": "Both of the replies given above are excellent suggestions. First start with either an internist or an endocrinologist. Before your visit since you do have many things going on, write all the things down for the doctor to quickly view as you discuss things with him/her. With so much going on I find patients may forget something important to tell the doctor..if you have a list, its much easier to address each one.Whenever\u00a0\u00a0your not taken serious by your physician or any physician you seek help from, move on. Remember the doctor works for you, he is your guide to better health and healing. If your not getting satisfaction its time to bring in what we refer to as the BIG GUNS, a specialist. Hopefully you have access to a good research hospital also. Good luck in your endeavor to find an answer and the road to good health.",

    "question": "Hi, i am hoping someone here can shed some light on how i feel. I am 19 yr old, female 5'2, usually 102lbs but now 95lbs.\u00a0\u00a0i have been told i have anxiety and hypoglycemia but not diabetic. I also had bells palsy when i was 8 yrs old.\u00a0\u00a0My family medical history includes strokes, Heart failure, high blood pressure, and diabetes. My grandfather died of heart attack, two of my aunts have had heart attacks,\u00a0\u00a0my great grandmother had many strokes. My older half-sister was born with heart disease and has had a few open heart surgeries.\u00a0\u00a0My other half sister has been told that her heart flips. My mom has high blood pressure, high\u00a0\u00a0cholesterol and diabetes. All of this is in my history but no doctors think i am at any risks.When i started feeling down,\u00a0\u00a0it felt like a virus.\u00a0\u00a0I was weak and a little nauseous.\u00a0\u00a0That lasted for a couple days and went away.\u00a0\u00a0i started to lose my appetite and lost a couple pounds. Then i began having anxiety attacks almost every day for 5 days.\u00a0\u00a0I started having stomach problems and went to see my doctor.\u00a0\u00a0She gave me klonopin for my anxiety and said i have gastritis and prescribed zantac. The klonopin made me depressed so i stopped. I started having pain in my left jaw and at night i would start to feel numb on left side of my face.\u00a0\u00a0I was afraid i was having a stroke and went to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0They told me is anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0But the numbness is still there. i went again when it happened again and was told i may have a dental infection.\u00a0\u00a0I was given\u00a0\u00a0penicillin. i got more sick after taking it,\u00a0\u00a0i just didn't feel right.\u00a0\u00a0After day 3 i went to my primary doctor and told her and she said stop taking it because she saw no sign of infection. i told her how i had been feeling and she said it's possible i have shingles. She\u00a0\u00a0gave me valtrex. After the first dose i had extreme back pain and fever.\u00a0\u00a0She told me to\u00a0\u00a0not take it anymore.\u00a0\u00a0I felt lost. Everyone was just throwing drugs at me and then telling me to stop taking them.I started having a hard time breathing with no anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Trust me,\u00a0\u00a0i know what the anxiety feels like.\u00a0\u00a0But doctors seem to think i don't.\u00a0\u00a0Everytime I've gone to the hospital,\u00a0\u00a0they chock it up to anxiety. Then i had extreme pain and went again.\u00a0\u00a0This time they told me i might have pleurisy or costochrondritis\u00a0\u00a0(inflammation of the chest wall ).. the pain came and went and when it came it lessened after a couple days. but the trouble breathing remained.\u00a0\u00a0It feels congested but i have no congestion and my cough is dry. The other night i started having extreme pressure and pain in my chest near my heart,\u00a0\u00a0another trip to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I am told i still have gastritis and also GERD. Apparently gerd feels like a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0I have had ekgs done many times and told my heart is fine and chest xrays show nothing wrong with my lungs.\u00a0\u00a0now is been almost a month and this is how i feel.\u00a0\u00a0Chest pressure, random chest pain in middle and under left breast. It feels like it's my heart.\u00a0\u00a0trouble sleeping and when i am falling asleep,\u00a0\u00a0i feel like my heart skips a beat or i lose a breath. Lying flat increases the pressure in my chest so I've been sleeping propped up. And I'm told when i sleep, I've started twitching. Getting out of bed makes the presure in my chest worse. breathing deeply doesn't hurt or help.\u00a0\u00a0Also for a few days the left side of my chest felt tickly. Like my nerves were bothered.\u00a0\u00a0I was told it was anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0Again.\u00a0\u00a0But it felt worse when i touched my skin. And my left breasr feels swollen especially in the center of my chest.\u00a0\u00a0When i lie my hand lightly on my chest,\u00a0\u00a0it becomes instantly harder to breathe. The tickly feeling is gone now but the pressure is still there.Also, i keep losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0I am desperately trying to gain it back,\u00a0\u00a0i eat six times a day and even get woken up at night hungry. Yet, it seems that i lose\u00a0\u00a0a pound every couple days.\u00a0\u00a0It's scary and no one is taking me seriously.",
