            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.That is a difficult question to answer. First off, so-called \"strokes\" can be caused by either clots or bleeds. Sometimes you start with a clot, take anticoagulants and end up with a bleed. The etiology of the stroke is important. For example, a small stroke can be caused by simple dehydration. The human brain has great redundancy. In some cases memory is damaged. In other strokes only partial paralysis may be involved, which may disappear. As to whether or not the patient can be \"just like they were\", the answer is \"probably not\", however with a caveat. Some stroke patients do appear to have 100 percent recovery. And many regain a great deal of their abilities. If the \"stroke\" is stabilized, and there is no further bleeding or clotting I would remain optimistic. Good Luck with his therapy.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
