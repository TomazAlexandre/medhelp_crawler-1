    "question": "How do you deal with it? Both my ears and sinuses are infected, I cant stop coughing, my chest and upper back are really hurting when I breathe, im hot then cold then hot again, and im throwing up. Im on 500 mg keflex, 4mg zofran, taking cough drops and tums but nothing is getting better.... only worse. Ive tried crackers, 7up, soup, hot showers, chugging water and still nothing. Any ideas on how to just feel a little better?",
