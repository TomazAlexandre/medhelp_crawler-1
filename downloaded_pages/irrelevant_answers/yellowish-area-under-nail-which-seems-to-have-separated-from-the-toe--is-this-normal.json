            "answer": "Toby,You are correct, this does sound like a toenail fungal infection. Fungus may turn a toenail yellow, brown and sometimes black. The nail may become thickened with fungal debris growing underneath. The fungus likes to grow under the nail lifting it up so yes it is common for it to detach.There are other things that may mimic a fungal infection. Trauma itself can cause toenails to have similar changes as can a yeast infection.The best way to determine the cause is to see a local podiatrist. He/she can take a sample/biopsy to determine if fungus is growing.Hope this has been helpful.Bryant Tarr D.P.M.www.sudburypodiatry.comwww.westfordpodiatry.com",
