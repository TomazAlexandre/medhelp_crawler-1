            "answer": "I was diagnosed at 10 and have been a type 1 diabetic for over 50 years. As a teen I smoked and I can assure you that almost nothing you or anyone can say will change your grandson's attitude. You are simply too old and he is too young for it to be any other way. Any type of psych review will simply harden the attitude - believe me.Teens smoke for the image they think it portrays and due to peer pressure. Hope he finds a girlfriend or boyfriend that does not smoke and he will stop soon enough. Complications will set in generally following the 20 year rule - 20 years from diagnosis some form of complication will set in. Hope he is regularly screened by a doctor and signs of complications are caught early. That also will be a time his sense of immortality will be tested and a chance for his attitude to change and for him to quit.It is normal for all young people to feel immortal and diabetics are no different. Not only will nothing ever harm or touch them but they also can be attempting to deny the existence of their condition. They simply want acceptance by their peer group and to fit in at all costs.Don't harp on about his smoking but do indicate that you will not accept him smoking around you or in your house. Pass it off as sensitivity on your part and do not call him\u00a0\u00a0out. I will bet he will stop smoking sometime in his early 20's on his own when he is emotionally able to accept his condition and is more mature. Only a smoker can quit and only when THEY are motivated to do so.",
