            "answer": "Now I see what you mean by fluctuations; some good, some borderline, others high. Have you had a thyroid TSH test performed? An irregular thyroid can disrupt your glucose levels. Also, your pancreas checked. There is a test called the C-Peptide that checks to see if your pancreas is producing the right amounts of insulin when needed. One or both could be contributing factorsto your irregular fluctuations.Continue to monitor your nutrition while staying away form bad carbs and junk foods. Get down\u00a0\u00a0to normal weight and try to figure out an exercise routine. Take a brief walk after lunch. Walking really helps to lower and stabilize your glucose levels. Sounds off the wall but it's true. And do make an appointment to see your PCP and have those two organs checked asap.Good luck and good health.",

            "answer": "Do you mean 6.7 on the TSH, Gus? Yes, that is high and unstable thyroid can definitely make it difficult to stabilize diabetes so be sure that gets back in target range.You don't mention how the doctor views your numbers and what his treatment plan is. Waverider is absolutely right that you can control with diet and exercise but it is important to be on the correct meds as well. Have your numbers been stable in the past? How long have you been diagnosed? If you have been Type 2 for awhile and your numbers are no longer stable you might be producing insufficient insulin and the test Waverider mentioned can determine if you in fact need to go on insulin at this point.I don't want to complicate the issue, but if your thyroid is stabilized, you practice good nutrition and exercise and have a good weight level and you still aren't stable you might want to consult with an endocrinologist to see if you are in fact not a Type 2, but a 1.5. Those of us with autoimmune disorders (I too suffered from thyroid disease) are often found to have 1.5 which is an autoimmune type of diabetes and needs to be treated with insulin.",

Are you quite sure that is the correct number? If you are that hypothyroid that would most certainly explain your having trouble stabilizing your diabetes and your numbers aren't all that bad. You might want to measure your numbers two hours after eating. What you need is a fasting number (that should be 70-100) and a post-prandial number (two hours after eating) that should be under 140, though some accept under 180.Have you been given a diabetic educator to work with?

I've done way too much of that myself since February when I got started on insulin and my numbers have been on a roller coaster...and I DON\"T LIKE rollercoasters! Yes, your numbers can be fine-tuned for a bit more consistency but you (and I) will get there in time. I'm learning that it's a process and there is a lot to learn. Sounds like your science background will come in handy! For me, my highly probable Type 1.5 diagnosis means my body is producing varying amounts of insulin which can make it hard to be stable. For you your hypothyroidism can certainly account for inconsistent numbers and you are on your way to correcting that problem.I apologize for my ignorance; since I posted this someone else mentioned hypothyroid levels of 85. Mine usually tend off in the other direction when they destabilize (.087) or just a bit low like they are now (5.13), so I was unfamiliar with those kind of numbers!Enjoy your day!Zoe",

Hyperthyroid means you have a high level of the thyroxine (T4)hormone in circulation. Low levels of thyroxine (Hypothyroid) picked up by the pituitary gland prompts an increase in the production of Thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH).\u00a0\u00a0If the thyroid gland is not functioning and can't produce thyroxine in response to TSH, than TSH production will continue, consequently increased levels TSH with low T4. The opposite when you have an over active Thyroid gland with increase T4 production (Hyperthyroid) and low levels of TSH. This is control by a negative feedback mechanism which is different than glucose metabolism. Did I muddle it up more?",

Without understanding the mechanism,\u00a0\u00a0basically the TSH readings are upside down: A low number like I had last year of .087 means severely hyperthyroid. A high number like Gus has of 65 means severely hypothyroid. I find it confusing to talk about \"high\" and \"low\" so just prefer hyper or hypo. (Wave Rider, you probably wanted an explanation more like Gus'!In answer to your question, Gus, I don't technically have either! (How's that for a confusing response). I was originally diagnosed with hyperthyroidism (Graves Disease to be exact) back in 1994. They could not regulate it with meds so they destroyed my thyroid gland with radiation. I then was put on Synthroid to replace thyroid function. Stable on the same dose for 13 years. Then when I was diagnosed with diabetes that destabilized my thyroid level for some reason and I became, though I didn't know it, because the symptoms were more subtle, severely hyperthyroid again (the .087). The doc adjusted my dose and I stabilized. Recently I became aware I was off kilter again, this time a tad low (5.1, nothing compared to your numbers) and the endo changed my dose again to get me back in range. My understanding is that either hyper-or hypo thyroid can make it difficult to manage blood glucose.",
