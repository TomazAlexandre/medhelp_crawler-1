The bacteria would pass from me to him and it would stay and multiply in the skin fold.\u00a0\u00a0There is a happy ending ... he was circumcised (as an adult, ouch!) and we never had the problem again.\u00a0\u00a0 Good luck to you.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps.",

    "question": "HiI have suffered from thrush twice a month for over two years now. I also have constant headaches, a very bloated stomach, nausea and lots of sore throats. My doctor after having conducted several tests has now given up. But surley you cant feel this ill for two years and accept it as normal? I recently took a weeks course of anti fungals that he assured me would wipe out all candida in my system, the day after i finished the course the thrush came back. I take probiotics and garlic capsules as these are meant to help but i'm now starting to get really fed up with being ill all the time. Can any one help???\u00a0\u00a0I'm also constanly dehydrated, even though i drink a litre and a half of water a day and my kidney hurts sporadically, i'm sure all of this must be connected somehow.I Posted this in the wrong place to begin with sorry!!!",
