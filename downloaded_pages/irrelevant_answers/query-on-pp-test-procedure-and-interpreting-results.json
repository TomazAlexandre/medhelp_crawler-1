            "answer": "You're right, your doctor a bit premature and in need of diabetes education/training. Within 1 hour after eating your glucose [blood sugar] is still rising. Saying you're high 20 mins after eating is a false/positive and meaningless jibber jabber. The 2-3 hour postprandial test is to see if your body has produced the right amounts of insulin to return your glucose back to normal levels. This is the normal PP time period, not 20 mins. HTH",

            "answer": "Hello,yes a proper protocol for testing is 2 hours after eating.However, 234 is way too high for any time after eating, and at only 20 minutes after eating you hadn't yet absorbed the food properly yet so your blood sugar was likely on the way up.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I would not say false positive in this setting.Therefore, you doctor's conclusion that your blood sugar is high is correct.I hope this has triggered some more testing and/or treatment.\u00a0\u00a0It is extremely important that diabetes is well managed to prevent long-term complications.Your numbers are indicative of diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a home meter?\u00a0\u00a0You will need to control carbohydrate intake and meal portions, try to ensure your weight is optimal and take up some exercise if you don't already.Non-diabetics rarely go higher than about 120, though 140 is considered a reasonable limit following a high carb meal (Cornflakes and milk is a high carb meal - though I don't know how big your portion was).Please let us know what is happening with you now.",

            "answer": "Hello,\u00a0\u00a0do you have a home monitor? Measure fasting, then 2 hours after eating. You can also measure before next meal to see if your sugar came down if the 2 hr post eating was high.Strongly recommend low carb diet. This requires you to eat more fat and protein to replace carbs.\u00a0\u00a0Non-starchy veges all ok.\u00a0\u00a0Bernstein \"diabetes solutions\" available on amazon, 2011 edition, is excellent resource if you are interested.From your age and physique there is possibility you are adult onset type 1 (also called lada).
