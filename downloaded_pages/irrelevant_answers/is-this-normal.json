            "answer": "My mother was 19 when she was diganose with type 1 diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0She is also what the dr's classify as a Brittle Diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0Her life has been up and down over the past 40 years of dealing with this disease.\u00a0\u00a0She was just like your daughter, lows and highs, highs and low.\u00a0\u00a0Never stable.\u00a0\u00a0Then 5 years ago she went on the pump.\u00a0\u00a0That seemed to stabilize her better.\u00a0\u00a0You might want to check it out if she isn't already on it.Also remind her daily to be kind to her feet.\u00a0\u00a0Those are one of the first things to start to deteriorate in brittle diabetics.Good Luck and if you need anything.\u00a0\u00a0Email me at mom2grls@anderson-website.net",

            "answer": "Thanks for your reply.\u00a0\u00a0We tried the pump over a year ago and her body rejected it.\u00a0\u00a0She kept getting little staff infections at the sites.\u00a0\u00a0The doctors took her off of it and said that she may can try it later on in life.\u00a0\u00a0She is on a new long acting insulin, Levimere at night and the morning and that has done great for her since we started it but we have incidents where her body rejects insulin and then we are dealing with lows.\u00a0\u00a0It is like her body is storing insulin and releases it all at once.\u00a0\u00a0Doctors don't have an excuse for that though.",

            "answer": "What my own doctors never told me and what I had to finally discover as an adult by doing my own reading, is that in the weeks before her menstrual cycle, hormone levels change in a female. And some of the horomones that increase in the week or weeks before her period are insulin-resistant, so many girls and women find that their sugar levels rise at that time. Some find it no big deal, while others find that they absolutely cannot get those sugars down during that time. And after those hormones dissipate, suddenly we can become hypoglycemic for several days. So look for the pattern of rising sugars followed by sudden drops in glucose during the last days or weeks of her cycle. I particularly have trouble with the lows, and they can be severe during this time. So if you know what the pattern is supposed to be, you can sort of be prepared for both highs and lows. Each person is different, and you just will have to figure out what the hormones are going to do specifically to her, and then try to be ready for the expected swings. I find that marking dates on the calendar helps me to\u00a0\u00a0be prepared.",

    "question": "I am the mother of a 16 yr old diabetic.\u00a0\u00a0She has been diagnosed for 4 years now and it has been a nightmare.\u00a0\u00a0She has had so many problems with getting her blood sugar under control.\u00a0\u00a0All the doctors we have seen say she is a \"brittle diabetic\" and that she should be easier to control after she turns 16 or 17.\u00a0\u00a0Here lately we have been dealing with severe lows.\u00a0\u00a0This come out of no where.\u00a0\u00a0I thought that after being a diabetic for this long you wouldn't see the Honeymoon stage again.\u00a0\u00a0This is what it looks like to me.\u00a0\u00a0I watch everything she does and she isn't taking too much insulin.\u00a0\u00a0It seems that if she has a good week, everything turns around and we back to Highs or Lows.\u00a0\u00a0HELP!",
