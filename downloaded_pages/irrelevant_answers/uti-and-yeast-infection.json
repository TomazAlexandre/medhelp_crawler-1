    "question": "I am pretty sure I have a UTI, they are reoccuring and I have had them before. But I also think I might have a yeast infection, I have all the symptoms of both. Is it possible for one to cause or trigger the other? What would my best treatments be? I would like to do over the counter or obtain a prescription. Im not sure I want to see my doctor, I just did for my yearly, had my pap and was tested, so I am pretty confident its not an STD. I did just finish my period about a week ago and the symptoms came about soon after.How good does cranberry suppliements( im not a big fan of drinking the juice) work? Also should I go on antibiotics, and hope it helps both or treat each seperatly over the counter? Any recommendations?Thanks!",
