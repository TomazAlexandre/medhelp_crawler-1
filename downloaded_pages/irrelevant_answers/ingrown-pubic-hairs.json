            "answer": "Hello,Boils or ingrown hair are caused by infection of the hair follicle by staph aureus. Hair follicles that are blocked by greasy creams, petroleum jelly, or similar products are more vulnerable to infection. Bacterial skin infections can be spread by shared cosmetics or washcloths, close human contact, or by contact with pus from a boil or carbuncle. So in addition to keeping the area dry and wearing loose cotton clothes, try to avoid using any greasy creams. Also recurrent infection of the hair follicles are found in diabetes, HIV infection, or other immune system disorders. So please get your blood sugar evaluated.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing. Kind regards.",

            "answer": "Hello,High blood sugar levels happen when the body either can't make insulin (type 1 diabetes) or can't respond to insulin properly (type 2 diabetes). In diabetes, glucose builds up in the blood, resulting in hyperglycemia. So high sugar diet may increase blood sugar but is not responsible for diabetes.I hope it helps. Take care and please do keep me posted on how you are doing. Kind regards.",
