            "answer": "viral load has no correlation to extrahepatic symptoms according to what I have read. I had a low VL, and had many symptoms such as aches/arthritis, fatigue,etc.I don't think lowering your vl by any extra conventional method will do anything for your hep c.\u00a0\u00a0This NP is trying to fatten her bank account and pay for some of the equipment she has bought. Don't help her.Loosing wt would probably benefit you more than these infusions and \"holistic\" approaches.I know you must be desperate for relief, but you are better off at doing a healthy eating plan that will boost your energy and allow you to shed extra pounds.check these studies I was reading recently on how liveer damage and vl does not correlate with feeling like ****( in non medical terms):http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hcsp/articles/hauser-1.htmlhttp://www.hepatitisnetwork.com/update18.htmlsome subjects did not have a viral load",

            "answer": "You also have to remember that VL fluctuate..My first PCR, my VL came back at 5462.. Dr's said it must be a mistake, and ordered another test.. Came back at like 5650..I started taking heavy supplementation, and eating healthy. Within 5 months, my ALT's where within norm, and my VL had dropped to 4000..Thats when I started tx..What I have heard from a holistic meds guy here in Miami.. Is that it is good to build the body up for tx. Flush the colon and intestines, detox all the buildups, and get the body prepared.My mother started right around the same time as me. Her VL was 4 million. Same supplements I was taking, along with healthy diet, drop her VL to 2.4 million before tx.And about your VL jumping so much after tx, I believe it replicates so easily and fast because the body is sooo vulnerable. Our CBC's are still low, and the natural defense is weak..So it can replicate almost worry free.Good luck, hopefully Califia will see this as I know she looked into vitamin C infusion..",

            "answer": "going back to ur post; did you stop tx b4 you were cleared?I too asked about the holistic approach and seemed to get mostly the same feedback as you are getting.\u00a0\u00a0I was taking something called transfer factor (supposed to strengthen ur immune iq)\u00a0\u00a0after taking all advise into account, i stopped taking this myself.\u00a0\u00a0my holistic person is a personal friend, was not offended and still gives me rekei (sp?) treatments.(although i'm not sure what they really do, i feel better when i leave her place b/c its a very peaceful place to be, water running, candles, etc.\u00a0\u00a0at first i thought rekei was a form of massage but she seems to just hold her hands in certain spots and transfer energy to me???\u00a0\u00a0sounds wierd huh??? oh well, i'm new and will take peacefulness wherever i can get it...good luck to youmichelle",

            "answer": "My investigation into Vitamin-C infusions never got very far.\u00a0\u00a0 They are extremely expensive (that stopped me right there), no one is willing to share actual statistics, and I was never able to unearth any patients who could talk about the impact on their health.\u00a0\u00a0That said, I want to strongly endorse all the above comments.\u00a0\u00a0 A program of gradual weight loss would serve you far, far better than spending thousands of dollars on an unproven medical treatment.\u00a0\u00a0 You would greatly improve your odds in treatment and more effectively control your diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Weight and insulin resistance is a crucial issue in treatment success, and unfortunately there's just no way of getting around that.\u00a0\u00a0Here is a URL to an article that you might find helpful:<a href=http://www.natap.org/2005/HCV/033005_01.htm><b>Insulin Resistance Impairs Response to IFN/RBV</b></a>Best of luck to you.",

    "question": "Have a holistic nurse practioner that thinks I would benefit from vitamin c infusions. Her daughter has limes disease and it decreased her viral load and helped her (she is young and I'm not) Any way, she also has a far-infrared sauna that is good for detox and thinks it would help too? Just a bit afraid to mess up my present state. Diabetes, tyroid, osteoposis, cervical cyst and the hep c, amoung major concerns. My idea if it could work, would be to do the vit. c and lower the viral #'s and try the TX again. (wanted to lose wt. to at least 165 too before I tried again, but that probably isn't realistic)\u00a0\u00a0My viral load went down to 2,350 after 8 months on pegasy/riba when I quit but never did a 10 log drop by 12 wks. It is up to 4,210,000 now. Higher than when I started drugs. So?????????What to do??????????My hepc PA says lets do the pegintron and if that doesn't work, will can try interfergen. BUT don't want to go through it again with no real results. Glad to see this site is still going on cuz you folks can relate more than anyone else.Any thoughts from anyone would be appreciated.",
