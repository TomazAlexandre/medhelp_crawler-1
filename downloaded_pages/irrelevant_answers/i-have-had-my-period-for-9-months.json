            "answer": "Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a problem in which a woman\u2019s hormones are out of balance. It can cause problems with your periods and make it difficult to get pregnant. PCOS may also cause unwanted changes in the way you look. If it is not treated, over time it can lead to serious health problems, such as diabetes and heart disease.PCOS is common, affecting as many as 1 out of 15 women. Often the symptoms begin in the teen years. Treatment can help control the symptoms and prevent long-term problems.That's probably why your doctor is trying to give you birth control. It seems without it you wont get your periods regularly on your own. If you are trying to get pregnant there are other ways to go about it instead of birth control.",

    "question": "Hi I have had my period for 9 mths now. My period has always been irregular it even went missing for a year, I had it checked out and they kept trying to push birth control on me and said nothing was wrong. Has this happened to other people and what was the cause? Or what could this be? I'm not sick and my body feels normal, it goes from very light to very heavy and just recently I started clotting.",
