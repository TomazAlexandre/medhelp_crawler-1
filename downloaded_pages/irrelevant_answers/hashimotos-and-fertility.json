    "question": "Hi,I was recently diagnosed with likely hashimoto's, although my TSH is only 6.4 and my T3/T4 are in the normal range.I have had positive ANA antibodies in the past too, but no other health conditions (maybe just on the low end of pre-diabetes).Anyway, I'm extremely worried about my fertility now. I read that the most common reason for early menopause/premature ovarian failure is Hashimoto's. I can't understand why I have Hashi's at 28 - none of my family members have it.Should I try to conceive now? I'm so worried that I'll go through early menopause. This fear is ruining my life, and I don't want to go out or do anything.Please help.",
