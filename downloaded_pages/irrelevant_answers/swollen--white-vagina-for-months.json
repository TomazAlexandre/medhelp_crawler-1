    "question": "Hey.\u00a0\u00a0Since August 2011, I have had this problem.\u00a0\u00a0I had sex with a latex condom, and a few days later, I began itching down there, and it burned when I urinated.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the doctor multiple times.\u00a0\u00a0I was treated for BV and a yeast infection, but it came back.\u00a0\u00a0I got tested again for BV, yeast (even asked to ID the species--got this test 3x), got my pee analyzed, and was tested for every STD under the sun as well as diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Everything came back negative. So, the doctor finally prescribed me a cream for contact dermatitis.\u00a0\u00a0Still no progress.\u00a0\u00a0I am thinking of seeing a new doctor, to see if they come up with anything else.\u00a0\u00a0I was wondering, did anyone else have this problem and was able to find a solution? I am sick of the constant doctor visits.",
