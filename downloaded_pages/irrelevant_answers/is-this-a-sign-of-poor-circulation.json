            "answer": "Right now I'm feeling it a little bit from my armpit down my arm to my hand, mostly on the outside. It's my right side so I assume it's because my right hand uses the mouse. My fingers will get stiff and a little swollen too, but mostly when I've been on the computer for awhile.What could all of this be?",

            "answer": "HiThanks for writing to the forum!Yes, there is a chance that you have compression of the spinal nerves in the cervical spine region. This can happen due to overuse of computers, work involving straining of neck, canal stenosis, bone disease, spondylosis, poor posture etc. A few neck exercises, or chiropractors can help relieve the pain, tingling and numbness. A MRI of the cervical spine may ne required. Please consult a neurologist.I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Deficiency of any of these can also cause on and off numbness. Diabetes and hypothyroidism too should be looked for.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "Thank you so much for answering! I will see about those blood tests. I sure hope it's not diabetes. I do have a lot of that in my family, so it is a bit of a worry.I forgot to mention, they did say I had a mild form of degenerative disc disease but that you see that in most women my age and that it's normal to have some degeneration, I guess. I don't know about that.Anyway, thanks again for everything!",

    "question": "Over this last year I noticed that my hand and sometime arm would fall asleep during sleep. I tried to be careful to not kink it up but I'd wake up with it asleep and have to shake it out and rub it to get the circulation back. It's happened with both hands and arms but it's usually my right one. I spoke with a doctor who thought it might be a pinched nerve or something. I still have it happen almost nightly.I've also noticed that after standing for a few minutes (like in church during worship) that my feet will start to fall asleep so that when I go to sit down I have to jiggle them or move them around, again to try to get the circulation going again.Sometimes I notice my hands or hand get that tingly feeling when I'm typing on the computer or doing something else.Are all of these signs that I have poor circulation? Should I be worried?",
