            "answer": "If I were you, I would ask my doctor about doing a fasting glucose test and then a glucose tolerance test in addition. This will tell him what your fasting levels are as sort of a baseline, and then also will show how your body responds to carbohydrates -- this test will show if your sugar levels are spiking high after you eat or drink carbs, or if they are dropping low, too. The reason I make this suggestion is that although thirst is more of a diabetes symptom, it is very true that if sugar levels drop too low, a dry mouth sensation similar to true thirst happens, too, and headaches are very common with low blood sugar. I would think you need to find out if your glucose levels are going either direction out of the norm, just to be safe.",

    "question": "I've been constantly thirsty and urinating every hour or less. It's been going on for a little over a week, and I have researched what the symptoms could mean, and since those are the only symptoms, along with headaches, I am very confused. no other symptoms of diabetes apply to me, but i know it isn't dehydration because of the constant urination and I haven't been vomiting or anything. please, if you have credible advice, let me know. I'm a young women and am scared I have diabetes.",
