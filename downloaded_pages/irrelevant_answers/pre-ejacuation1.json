            "answer": "My best advise is to either do the follow options or talk to your doctor.Option A: Masturbate by yourself without cumming. Once you feel it about to climax slow down and think on other things try to slow the sensation.Option B: try and masturbate before having intercourse. If there is no way to get erect after that. Have her try two things either gently touch the pubic region or have her cause sensation on the prostate gland.Option C: I would not advise this... But, it works for few people. Take either herbal or prescribed by your doctor to help in that way.Option D: OR you can try to find out more about this procedure I have stated below.",

            "answer": "Hello,Common causes causing such symptoms are stress and anxiety,poor communication with your partner, unrealistic sexual expectations, negative feelings about non performance smoking, alcohol and sometimes illicit drugs and medical conditions like diabetes, high blood pressure, heart or thyroid conditions, poor circulation, low testosterone, depression, testicular, spinal and neurological causes.The treatment of premature ejaculation is having a psychological session with the couple, stop-start or squeeze-pause techniques,desensitizing creams and SRRI(selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) in severe cases. My sincere advice is to consult a urologist.I hope it helps. Take care and regards.",
