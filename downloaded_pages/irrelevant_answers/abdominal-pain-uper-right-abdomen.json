            "answer": "Hello, Thanks for the help. I am a 43-year-old female. I have a similar problem, but there is no pain associated with a pressure sensation I have in the same spot (R side of upper abdomen). I cannot palpate a mass. Negative US for gall bladder and liver. Can a simple X-ray show something bad like a tumor? HIDA scan seems pretty expensive. I realize I cannot afford to have a serious illness go undetected, but I also would like to minimize health care costs ($3,500 deductible is all I can afford for private insurance). Any advice?",
