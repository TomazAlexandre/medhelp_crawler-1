            "answer": "I have a question more then a comment. Me and my partner had sex for the first time 3 weeks ago. Ever since we had sex I have ad pain, yes we did use a condom it also popped during the intercourse. I went and got tested a physical exam that confirmed that\u00a0\u00a0I had herpes. My partner said as soon as I called him he took a blood test and he said with in 2 hours\u00a0\u00a0the doctor had his results and he tested negative. He is the only man I have been with in 8 months and I have never had an outbreak or pain like this in my life. I now have a huge painful bump growning on my buttocks and it is very hard to sit down.Which of the medications to prevent outbreaks works better?I am also a Diabetic.Will the medication ACYCLOVIR affect my other medications such as Avandamet and Metaformin (general form of Gluaphage) for my diabetes??????",

            "answer": "If by \"ever since we had sex\" you mean the pain started immediately, then you probably didn't catch herpes from your new partner; it takes at least 2-3 days for herpes symptoms to start.\u00a0\u00a0However, the apparent severity of your pain suggests that you are having your first herpes infection.How big is your \"huge painful bump\"?\u00a0\u00a0That doesn't sound much like herpes, more like a bacterial infection (boil, abscess); as you may know, such infections are more common in diabetics than people without diabetes.None of the antiherpes drugs (acyclovir, valacyclovir, famciclovir) will interfere with your diabetes drugs.\u00a0\u00a0Presumably you are on acyclovir now?\u00a0\u00a0If not, get a prescription right away; it will help speed healing of your herpes.\u00a0\u00a0All three drugs are equally effective in preventing future outbreaks; the differences are in dosing frequency and cost.There is a rapid herpes blood test called Biokit HSV, which gives results within 30 min.\u00a0\u00a0It's pretty reliable, but not perfect.\u00a0\u00a0If that's the test your partner's HCP used, it seems likely he doesn't have HSV-2.\u00a0\u00a0But if\u00a0\u00a0your sexual practices include oral sex, your herpes might be due to HSV-1, and Biokit doesn't test for that virus.By the way, make sure your doctor does a culture on you, or at least takes a blood test later to learn for sure which virus is causing your infection.\u00a0\u00a0HSV-1 vs HSV-2 makes a lot of difference in the likelihood you will have recurrent outbreaks, whether you can transmit the infection to future partners, etc.Good luck--\u00a0\u00a0HHH, MD",

            "answer": "YEs this is my first outbreak ever. I hadn't had sex since Oct 04 when I had sex with him in Mar 05 yes it was painful because its been some time and I have always been senstive when it come to having sex after a long break from engaging in sex. The symptons did not occur until after a few day because I came on my cycle late the next evening after we had sex. After my cycle was gone I was in pain and after a week I went and got checked out. During the doctor's exam she stated I had herpes due to the look of the infected area and swab testing. I have been on on Alyvoir or about 2 weeks now and the large lump on my right butcheek right in the panty line area still bothers me but my smyptons on my vagainal area have cleared. I am experiencing pain in the same area of my buttocks on the left side but no lumps have developed. If I also have a yeast infection will the simple over the counter medication help?",
