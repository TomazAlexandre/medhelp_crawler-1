            "answer": "Strait,Your symptoms are very concerning for myocardial ischemia. Given your multiple risk factors for coronary disease including longstanding diabetes, I think you should be evaluated in a helth care setting.The new onset of chest symptoms in a patient with risk factors should not be taken lightly. It would not be that convienent, ecg and some blood work as well as some type of further risk identification.Especially concerning in you is your escalation of symptoms. Once you are evaluated for life threatening causes of your symptoms, other evaluation can take place.Ill be glad to help more once you undergo evaluation.",

            "answer": "Not to worry you, but to let you know that I had a heart attack 2 months ago.\u00a0\u00a0I am a female, 39 years old, I am (was) a smoker, but had absolutely no other risk factors.\u00a0\u00a0My symptoms were very similar to yours (but I dismissed them at first as being stress, gas, etc.) other than I didn't have the pounding heart.\u00a0\u00a0Had I gone in sooner, the blockage may have been found and saved me from having a heart attack.\u00a0\u00a0On the other hand, had I gone in sooner and my ecg shown a false negative, the cardiologist said himself that he probably would have sent me home because it is not \"common\" for a woman of our age to have a heart attack.You also have the diabetic risk factor and a pounding heart that I didn't have, which is all the more reason to get checked out again. I wouldn't leave it if I were you. You have nothing to lose to get it checked out, but a whole lot to lose if you ignore what could be a serious problem.Good luck.Jann",
