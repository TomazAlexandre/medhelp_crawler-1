            "answer": "Kevin,It sounds like you have something verious serious going on with your foot that needs immediate medical attention.\u00a0\u00a0I can see that you are very concerned and am glad that you have come here to get some help with your problem.\u00a0\u00a0As LRS suggested, it is very important that you get to a clinic quickly and get your foot treated before it becomes any more serious.I know you mentioned not being able to afford the medical bills and the missing work.\u00a0\u00a0I am not sure where you live, but Medicaid may be available to you.\u00a0\u00a0Medicaid is insurance for those with low income and is available in most if not all of the 50 states.\u00a0\u00a0If you do live in the US, check out this website: http://www.cms.hhs.gov/medicaid/ and see if you qualify for this benefit.\u00a0\u00a0You may also go to an urgent care facility or emergency room for treatment.\u00a0\u00a0They will work out a payment plan with you, even if it is only $20 a month as long as you pay on it.It sounds like you may have a deep infection that is spreading into your foot and needs antibiotics immediately. Diabetic or not, you never want to let your feet get infected without proper treatment.\u00a0\u00a0As LRS mentioned before, please follow the doctors advice exactly.\u00a0\u00a0I cannot stress enough to you how important it is that you get to a doctor right away.Please do let us know how everything turns out.",

            "answer": "Kevin,None of us are physicians here, but what you describe sounds incredibly serious -- as you well know.My best advice is for you to get to an urgent care facility as soon they open in the morning.\u00a0\u00a0Wounds that do not heal can lead to devastating and more serious complications.When they treat you, follow their advice to the letter.\u00a0\u00a0Work out a gradual payment plan and then dedicate yourself to taking good care of yourself.I can understand your fear and also the challenge of trying to manage wihtout health care.\u00a0\u00a0Find an ER or urgent care facility right away.Will you let us know how you're progressing?\u00a0\u00a0Good luck, and please do see a doctor right away.",

            "answer": "Kevin,Go to your local hospital.\u00a0\u00a0They cannot turn you away, and as mentioned before you can pay gradually.\u00a0\u00a0Just send them something every month and they can't press your for the whole amount unless you miss a payment.\u00a0\u00a0My sister had a similar situation with over a $6000 bill, and has faithfully paid about $50 a month for years.\u00a0\u00a0They can however, sue you for the whole amount if you are even so much as one day late with your payment.In any event--GO TO A HOSPITAL.\u00a0\u00a0You will find yourself losing a foot if you do not act quickly.\u00a0\u00a0This is an emergency.\u00a0\u00a0GO.",

            "answer": "Dear Kevin,There are too many people who have no insurance who are dealing with medical problems with no health coverage, but I agree with the past comments. You can go to a hospital for treatment. They cannot turn you away. You can pay a very small amount each month. It is not worth losing a foot. It sounds not only very painful, but extremely dangerous to let this go one day further. My son, while he does have type 1 diabetes, is dealing with a major infection in his ankle. Either way you need to take care of it with medical attention immediatley.Please,let us know how you are doing. You have many in here that are concerned with your outcome. You are in my thoughts.Keep in Touch,dm",

            "answer": "I just wanted to thank everyone for the comments, they scared me enough to go to the hospital.\u00a0\u00a0I went to the emergency room and they admitted me. The infection in my toe did go to the bone. So after six days in the hospital they sent me home. i have to do IV antibiotics for six weeks. hopefully it will work because if not they are going to have to take my toe.i applied for medicaid while i was in the hospital but that is still pending. im crossing my fingers its approved because so far I owe about $20,000. i know i can make payments though.",

            "answer": "Dear kevin btn,I am so glad that you went to the hospital. While the cost seems extreme, it is worth your health. I hope medicaid comes through for you. If you are turned down, you might seek legal help if it is determined by a physician that you are disabled. Even if it is short term. Many legal teams will do this for a percentive of moneys that may be owed to you from Social Security. It can be a trying system, but it can work. I also hope that you have talked to the hospital resources to find out, if due to your financial issues, if they have a program that could reduce your bill.Please remember that this is only my own personal opinion. I am not a physician and I do not have a law degree. I am strictly coming from my own experience.I wish you well and please keep in touch.dm",
