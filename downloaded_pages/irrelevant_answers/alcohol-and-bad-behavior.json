            "answer": "You can not blame your husband alone for the dimise of your marriage.\u00a0\u00a0His drinking could be a contributor to your problems, but both of you are to blame for it.\u00a0\u00a0When you two said your vows, you vowed to stay with him \"For better or Worse\".\u00a0\u00a0Now when the \"worse\" is happening, you are going after a divorce.\u00a0\u00a0Alcoholism is a terrible addiction, my mother was an alcoholic.\u00a0\u00a0She also passed away from the effects of drinking for years; she was only 55 years old.\u00a0\u00a0Have you ever asked why your husband was drinking?\u00a0\u00a0Also just because someone holds a job doesn't mean that they aren't an alcoholic.\u00a0\u00a0My mother always worked, she would drink till 5am and be to work at 8am everyday, she was an alcoholic!It sounds like you need to forgive him for the past and let it go, not to bring it up again. You can not change what he did to you, you can not make it go away.\u00a0\u00a0As far as the drinking, it is something that he has to want to stop doing.\u00a0\u00a0Your pleas will go unheard (which frustrates you, I know) but he truely has to want it.Sorry if this is harsh, I have a problem with that!!",

            "answer": "nancy-take care of urself dear..its time.....long overdo time.....35 years of drinking is a LONG time....i can imagine the damage that has been done and forgiving and moving on will be a long process for u.ppl don't stop drinking until they get sick n'tired of being sick n' tired and own the responsibility for their behaviors that damaged others and themselves.i've been sober/clean going on 25 years...and dayjob is subastance abuse counselor..i watch spouses spend years hoping their hubs will smell the coffee and wake up....and they lose themselves in the process if the person chooses the drink over them and the marriage.keep up with the al-anon and the counseling!",

            "answer": "It takes two to tango BUT his blaming his alcoholism on not loving you is bunch of bologna.Do not own one bit of that honey.\u00a0\u00a0Infidelity, not acceptable.\u00a0\u00a0Financial irresponsibility is a symptom of anger and alcoholism.Alcoholism is a disease just like diabetes is a disease.\u00a0\u00a0With diabetes your pancreas does not regulate insulin properly.\u00a0\u00a0With alcoholism your brain does not tell you when you have had enough or tells you more is better.Alcoholism is categorized as a genetic disorder.\u00a0\u00a0Runs in families.\u00a0\u00a0I have come to believe one can drink yourself into alcoholism also.\u00a0\u00a0ibizan would know the accuracy of that statement.Bring the relationship down to basics and if that isn't there, then a divorce is apparent. If the alcoholism is the basis of the problems, take care of yourself and follow izibans suggestions and let that man hit bottom.\u00a0\u00a0He needs to want his sobriety.\u00a0\u00a0It never works if they get sober for someone else.Detach with Love, a wonder man Father Martin talks about.\u00a0\u00a0You can still love him but you need to detach from him for your own sake.\u00a0\u00a0I will attach Father Martins link. He has many tapes and CD's for Alcoholics and their families that are amazing and supportive.",

            "answer": "Maybe he is telling the truth or maybe it is denial.I was married at 17 to someone i did not love and after like 24 years turned to heavy drinking to escape it. my job didn't suffer any. i just could not accept my situation any longer and needed escape. of course this caused more and more problems with the 2 of us. but i was so miserable, i just didn't care. we are now divorced and my drinking stopped almost immeadiately.",

            "answer": "Wow!\u00a0\u00a0scaredtodeath321, I am stunned!\u00a0\u00a0Your comment to Nancy321 was, well, anything but thoughtful or supportive.\u00a0\u00a0You scolded her for not staying in what was at the very least an emotionally abusive marriage.\u00a0\u00a0Also, you obviously did not think about what she wrote.\u00a0\u00a0Her husband abandoned her, she did not abandon him.\u00a0\u00a0I think you were so anxious to talk about your emotional issues that you didn't absorb the words Nancy321 wrote.\u00a0\u00a0 Financial irresponsibility, adultery, blaming others, etc. is very bad behavior.\u00a0\u00a0It ruins lives.\u00a0\u00a0It ruins families.\u00a0\u00a0Nancy321 tolerated years of abandonment and horrible behavior before her irresponsible, self-centered alcoholic husband forced her hand.\u00a0\u00a0I am where she was.\u00a0\u00a0It is a nightmare, only worse.\u00a0\u00a0At least you wake up in the morning and the nightmare is over.\u00a0\u00a0This kind of life is the opposite of the life a husband promises his wife when he takes his wedding vows!\u00a0\u00a0Nancy321, I hope you are through the nightmare and you are at peace.\u00a0\u00a0Scared, I wish the same for you.",

    "question": "How do you know if it is truly alcoholism or problem drinking as the cause for horrible irresponsibility in a relationship? Could my husband just be a bad person? He does not see any correlation between his drinking and the problems in our marriage-financial irresponsibility, infidelity, abandonment of his family and of a 35 year marriage. I have been in counseling and based on his behaviors I have been told that is the problem. I go to Alanon and everything points to it.I am in the processing of divorcing him but I still love him.He says his behavior is because he doesn't love me anymore and has nothing to do with drinking. He says if drinking was the problem, he would have lost his job. His drinking he says is because he doesn't love me anymore.",
