    "question": "Hi I am a 33 year old female, 5 \"9, 150lbs., healthy until the past 2 years.\u00a0\u00a0I have not felt good since having my son 2 years ago.\u00a0\u00a0I am a Registered Nurse and just have not been well physically since having my son. I am not depressed but do get frusterated at times for feeling so crappy (health) when I am only 33 and should feel good.\u00a0\u00a0After I had my son I had terrible back pain and have continued to have back pain off and on since.\u00a0\u00a0On top of that I have had at least 10 infections (all varying from UTI's to ear infection to pneumonia) requiring antibiotics since having my son.\u00a0\u00a0I also have experienced very dry skin, fatigue, hair loss/thining heat/cold intolerances, achy bones (still). I understand much of this is normal after having a baby but 2 years later is not normal. Lab work has always been normal except for when I have had an active infection did have elevated WBC. All during this time I have seen my primary internal medicine dr, who sent me to a physiatrist for the back pain. The medical staff knows I am a RN but have hinted at times that I am a hypochondriac because they could not find abnormal lab work or anything horrible on my MRI.\u00a0\u00a0MRI did find 3 buldging disks which explains my lower back pain but not my mid back pain.\u00a0\u00a0In the past 5 months I have also started getting eratic elevated Blood Pressures as high as 173/118 for no reason at all (not stressed or even doing anything) plus episodes of ha with dizziness. They come and go. Internal med. thought I may have a Pheochromocytoma but MRI and CT was neg.only thing that was noted was mild narrowing of my renal arteries which no specialist I have seen can seem to tell me if this is normal for someone my age.\u00a0\u00a0I did have excessive dopamine in 24 hour urine test as well as a huge output of 5000mL.\u00a0\u00a0I knew I always urinated alot but never knew it was that crazy.\u00a0\u00a0Then I was sent to a Endo. who just saw me for the first time last week and thinks I may have diabetes insipidus.\u00a0\u00a0Here are my most recent labs.\u00a0\u00a0Most are normal but the\u00a0\u00a0Cortisol (ACTH) stim test results and Urine Osmo.\u00a0\u00a0I have a brain MRI next week to r/o Pit. damage or tumor.\u00a0\u00a0I just want to know that there is a reason for all of this besides diabetes insipidus, which I know causes polyuria and polydipsia.\u00a0\u00a0But what about the back pain and other issues?\u00a0\u00a0Do the following lab results indicate another issue besides DI?Any help from someone who knows Endo?Component Latest Ref Rng 9/30/2010 9/30/2010 9/30/2010WBC'S AUTO 4.8-10.8 7.5RBC AUTO 3.80-5.40 4.19HGB 11.4-16.0 13.3HCT AUTO 34.2-47.0 38.2MCV 80-99 91.3MCHC 32-36 34.8RDW, RBC 11.5-14.5 12.9PLT'S AUTO 130-440 298NA 135-145 137K 3.5-5.3 3.9CL 98-108 103CO2 22-32 25HGH ng/mL 0.2IGF-I 276 . . .CORTISOL AM 4.3-22.4 12.8 29.1 (H) 33.7 (H)BUN 8-20 9CREAT 0.5-1.2 0.7CA 8.7-10.0 9.5OSMO 280-300 292OSMO UR 300-1300 138 (L)GLUC 60-200 98PROLACTIN 2.8-29.2 4.4",
