I called the herpes hotline and they said that 2 months is too long for a herpes outbreak. I am very scared and confused and depressed because I do not know where to turn. I have no health insurance, and do not what to do. If anyone has ever been through this or has any information, please help a desperate girl out. I also add that I am diabetic type 1, dont know if this might have anything to do with this.Also, is there any other condition that might include these symptoms.Thank you so much reading all this and wish me the best of luck.

            "answer": "Planned Parenthood acts like its no big deal because when they deal wtih giving 100 phone calls a day, they lose interest in caring. They also dont give a hoot if you're unexpectidly pregnant, in their eyes, every case of unplanned pregnancy is a case for abortion, and they do what they can to sell you into abortion. So with that said, they wont be a big help to the infection you have. You need to see a real doctor about it, and get on a medication to make the rash go away.The only advice that I have to help it go away, is to keep it clean. Wear panty liners and change them throughout the day. Whipe with antibacterial whipes, use peroxide/bactine and neosporine at <night>. YOU NEED TO KEEP IT CLEAN AND DRY! When you start you period, do not, by any means, use a maxi pad, you will only irritate it more with the bacteria. Use tampons. Do whatever you can to dry it out and keep it clean. It's going to be a nucense, and it's going to be on your mind all day, but until you see a REAL doctor, do whatever you can. And, dont have sex. Also, get some monostat and use it for a week. You could have a yeast infection along with your breakout.You must see a doctor though, he will tell you what you need to know, and answer all your questions.",

            "answer": "Are you on Medicaid? If so, then you simply find a Gyn that accepts it. If not, then find a Gyn through a friends recommendation or even the phone book. Give them a call and explain your situation. Ask them how much an office visit will cost letting them know what Labs you have already had so that they won't have to order those particular tests again. You can ask to make payment arrangements, even if it means giving them a post dated check. Just ask if there is ANY way that they can work with you? If not then move on to the next one in the book. Plus this way you will know how much cash you will need and maybe you can borrow it from a friend or family member.Also maybe try the topical Monistat cream for the external irritation. Maybe it can give some relief.Also, and maybe I am way off here, but I know that diabetics can take longer to heal minor cuts and bruises. I wonder if your diabetes has anything to do with the fact that you aren't healing up. I assume you are being treated for the diabetes? Maybe speak to the doctor treating the diabetes about the other problems you are having and see if the healing, or lack of, can be linked.. Just a suggestion..Hope this helped.--J",

Because although it does happen genital to gential transmission of hsv-1 from what ive read is rare. and you said you tested negative for hsv-2. And about 50-70% of people will test positive for hsv-1. Maybe your rash isnt related to your herpes testing, the positive could be for oral herpes. Either way you should see a gyno. but who knows you could be worrying about genital herpes for no reason and not clearing up the real problem.",

            "answer": "PP is an excellent organization that provides good medical care to many, many women.The fact that you had a positive HSV1 blood test doesn't really mean anything. Do you ever get cold sores? Even if you don't, it's entirely possible and maybe probable that you have HSV1 orally and not genitally. It would be really unusual to have a herpes outbreak last this long, so I doubt it's genital herpes. And my guess would be your doctor thought so too, or s/he would have prescribed Valtrex.So what did the doctor say about the rash? If nothing, I'd call back and ask what the diagnosis was, and how you can treat it.",

When we have cases like that here, we always try to help, even if its only 5$ a month, at least its something, and they know your trying to make a payment. Also, if we know its a hardship case, we give discounts...I can not speak for other companies, but I know for us we try to help anyway we can to make it easier on the patient...like i said our company even accepts 5 or 10$ a month payments until it is paid in fullgood luck and god bless",

I'm scared and also very confused, I know who gave it to me, but i just dont know how to explain to him the situation and how it is important for him to get treated. He says that he did not know he had it because he had no outbreaks or symptoms; I'm confused because i am already having outbreaks and have been immediatley put on medication. Two days before i was diagnosed with genital herpes, I was diagnosed with an yeast infection; is it possible to have both at the same time? How long will this outbreak last? I have also lost weight and can hardly eat anything, is it stress? My legs hurt, and i find it very hard to sleep at night, I'm scared that I am letting this virus take control of me and I just was diagnosed 2 days ago. What do I do, Why am I in so much pain?",

    "question": "Ok, I know i have posted here about 1000 times, but i really need some answers or words of knowledge. Here is a little brief history: Around the end of August or beginning of september I had unprotected sex with a guy for about 20 minutes ( one time) and then about 2 weeks later (september 15) I had sex again with a new partner ( my current boyfriend), also unprotected, I know very stupid of me. Around the last days of October, I developed a very big painful rash in between my buttocks and vaginal lips. I tought at that time that it was irritation from a maxi pad. About a week and a half later the rash started healing, but soon after I developed a smaller rash in the two sides of my vaginal opening, with red painful bumps. I also got this open tear (like a paper cut) right in the area between the vaginal opening and the anal opening. Must i add that this was the same area that I got teared when I had sex before from lack of lubrication. Up to this day, I still have this rash. It goes away for about 2-3 days and then apprears again, also with the tear. I went to planned parenthood about 2 weeks ago and tested for HSV 1 and 2 and for yeast infection. This last Friday, they called me back and informed me that I was HSV 2 negative, but HSV 1 positive. She made it seem like no big deal, and told me it was nothing to worry about. The yeast test also came back negative. my doubts are that I still have this damn rash and I do not know what is, it really is ruining me, i have not had sex since then because I am afraid. I was wondering if it might have been too early to take the test",
