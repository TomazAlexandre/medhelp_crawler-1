            "answer": "None of us want to be on medication but for many, it's our only option.\u00a0\u00a0You can try therapy to determine exactly what is causing your anxiety, which is normally a traumatic event from our past that we never dealt with properly or have even forgotten about.\u00a0\u00a0If you learn what that is and deal with it, you can ease your anxiety.\u00a0\u00a0But therapy can be a lengthy process and you have to determine if you want to continue feeling lousy while going thru it or take your medication so you can feel better. Never assume any new symptom is anxiety related, see your doctor to rule out other causes first.\u00a0\u00a0You're trying to tell yourself you don't need the medication...but your body is saying you do.\u00a0\u00a0Fortunately, we have a choice to feel better, the rest is up to you.",
