            "answer": "Hi,Have you seen a urologist?Straining during urination, decrease in urine flow, dribbling of urine, difficulty in ejaculation may suggest obstructive symptoms. A complete physical examination by a physician is needed to determine the cause.Are there any palpable mass in the groin or scrotum? A simple urinalysis may not be enough. Further tests that would visualize the structures may be requested.",

    "question": "OK, so for a while now, (several years) my urine flow has seemed to lose strength.\u00a0\u00a0Also when I would go to wipe the head of my penis, the last drop would always be pink.\u00a0\u00a0At one point I urinated bright red blood.\u00a0\u00a0Scared me so I went to the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0He prescribed Cipro and this caused my urine flow to increase to the point where i was going to the restroom about 8-10 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0I usually go only aobut 4 times a day.\u00a0\u00a0The flow never increased but the volume did.\u00a0\u00a0Before the cipro I would take about 45-55 seconds to empty my bladder because of the poor urine flow.I am 35 years old.\u00a0\u00a0I'm a social drinker that usually drank margaritas and mostly liquor.\u00a0\u00a0I only recently started drinking beer.\u00a0\u00a0Before the holidays, I went out with my wife and got drunk off of beer.\u00a0\u00a0While still at the club I noticed that my urine flow was to the point where it was dribbling out.\u00a0\u00a0Within minutes when I would have to go back, my urine flow stopped all together and while the sensation that I was urinating was there, no urine flow was present.\u00a0\u00a0I found myself straining and because I was straining so much, I would have to sit down because i was afraid that i would have a bowel movement while trying to urinate.\u00a0\u00a0It felt like a workout.\u00a0\u00a0I would often sweat more than I would urinate.\u00a0\u00a0The episodes during which I could not urinate would usually last about 36 hours during which I would get no sleep because of the urge to go during the night.i have had about 4 such episodes where my urine flow would stop altogether.\u00a0\u00a0Three of those episodes happened during nights where I would drink beer.\u00a0\u00a0The last one happened within hours of taking a diet pill (phentermine).\u00a0\u00a0I am currently on flomax and while that seems to help a little, after 4 days of not taking it, my conditions immediatley went back to the point where I really noticed a decrease in urine flow.\u00a0\u00a0I noticed that a post in another forum said that when he went to urinate and farted, his urine flow would stop, that also happens to me.\u00a0\u00a0One other note, when I am having one of episodes, I not only cannot urinate but I also cannot ejaculate.\u00a0\u00a0I have an orgasm, but no ejaculate is present.\u00a0\u00a0Where did it go?I need help.",
