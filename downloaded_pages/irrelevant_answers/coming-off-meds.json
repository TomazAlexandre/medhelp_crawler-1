            "answer": "I can understand the weight gain. I gained 6lbs in 5 days when I increased my dose of risperdal. My psych put me on a med called Metfomin. It's technically for pre-diabetes, but it works by changing how your body uses and stores calories. It might be worth asking you p doc about it or a similar medication. It might mean that you'd be able to stay on your current medications, and stop gaining, and maybe start losing some of the weight.Good luck,~Dame",

            "answer": "You are on a lot of meds.\u00a0\u00a0I was like that yrs. ago; way overmedicated and way overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I'm now down to 2 antidepressants and 1 mood stabilizer. (I am also a rapid cycler). Everybody is different and responds to medication differently.\u00a0\u00a0The best and most all-around useful mood stabilizer for me has been Topamax.\u00a0\u00a0It is an anti-convulsant, also indicated for propylaxis of migraines (which I also have).\u00a0\u00a0The great side effect, if you're overweight, is WEIGHT LOSS.\u00a0\u00a0Be careful, though.\u00a0\u00a0I've lost 54 lb. in 10 months; now underweight and have continued to lose, in spite of attempts to gain.\u00a0\u00a0Have also been having GI problems, so not 100% sure is Topamax, but am now in the process of weaning off, to see.\u00a0\u00a0I'm switching to Abilify, which is indicated for use with lithium/valproate to stablize mania/mixed mood in bipolar I.\u00a0\u00a0I'm bipolar II, but we're going to give it a try as monotherapy.\u00a0\u00a0Since you're on lithium, and want to keep it, Abilify could also be an option.\u00a0\u00a0There are mixed reports, though, about wt. loss vs wt. gain; some lose, some gain.\u00a0\u00a0If your doc thinks Topamax may work and you're really overweight, it might be worth a shot.\u00a0\u00a0Of course, you have to wean off all the other meds, and Topamax is a wean-on med.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck.",

            "answer": "Hello,I have tried to self-prescribe doses for myself numerous times. Unfortunanately it has ALWAYS put me in\u00a0\u00a0a severe state of \"shock\" even if I taper it\u00a0\u00a0off. I have found that I am no doctor so I will not pretend to be one.I know all about the weight gain.I used to be a size 10 and now Im a 16(Im also on many meds and a rapid-cycler),yes I care about my physical appearance but my mental is far more important.Please talk to your doctor FIRST,Abilify is a great option. It is an anti-psychotic used to treat BiPolar in conjuction with Lithium.There are many choices out there and if your Dr doesnt listen to you then,well, its time to get a new one :)Be Well and let me know what you decide.",
