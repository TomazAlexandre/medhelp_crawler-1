            "answer": "Thanks for posting back with much needed information. I am unaware how medical patient services are handled in the UK nor what patients right are. In the US we have the right to fire any doctor and ask or choose [w/o asking] a new one of our choice. If this is pertains to you I would fire your current doctor for the simple reason of playing you as a human guinea pig by dispensing pills with a \"lets try this first\" attitude. A PCP [primary care doctor, family doctor] does not have the expertise to treat conditions such as yours - it is beyond their expertise. Find and go see an expert in their field of medicine.Are you taking any medications beyond what you have posted?\u00a0\u00a0You mention insulin and Victoza as two separate medications. True or not true? Did you start any new medication/s 6 mos ago? Increase any medication/s 6 mos ago?\u00a0\u00a0And go easy on the Ibuprofen, it is extremely hard on the liver.To treat your diabetes it would be in your best interest to seek out an Endocrinologist, a doctor who specializes in the treatment and care of the endocrine system - diabetes, thyroid, pancreas etc. Have your thyroid and pancreas tested. If the thyroid is misfiring it will disrupt pancreas insulin production. Test your pancreas for how well it produces insulin. Both are simple blood tests. He/she will look hard at your current medications and dosage. Discuss what you can do to lower the dose.Ask for a referral to a diabetes nutritionist to get educated on proper nutrition, weight loss if necessary, and types of in-home exercise programs. The latter may require seeing someone else. All are important with controlling and managing your glucose levels.Locate a Neurologist that specializes in peripheral Neuropathy [not all do]. Also a pain management specialist will help greatly. They have natural non-medication ways of dealing with pain.A doctor to consult on your arthritic condition is an Rheumatologist and possibly an Orthopedist.But most important of all fire your experimenting doctor. Write down all your medications, supplements including aspirin and ibuprofen, the dose you take and when, and present it to your \"new\" doctor/s.Good luck.",
