            "answer": "Has your grandma read the book yet called REVERSING DIABETES, by Dr. Julian Whitaker, M.D.? There are recipes in the book.She also could try some of the GASTRIC REFLUX TIPS (with her doc's permission), because these tips are good for both ulcers and reflux.If she is on an ACID BLOCKING MEDICATION, she MIGHT be having some bad side effects of the medication, including stomach and intestinal cramping! THIS IS VERY COMMON!!!!If she tries the gastric reflux tips, she can then ask her doc to give her a \"tapering\" down schedule, to help her slowly and safely \"wean\" off the acid-blocking medication!Here are some GASTRIC REFLUX TIPS:Some GASTRIC REFLUX TIPS (without acid blockers):GER=Gastro-Esophageal Reflux. (Gastro=stomach. Esophagus=food tube.)LPR= Laryngeal-Pharyngeal Reflux. (Larynx=voice box, containing the 2 vocal cords. Pharynx=throat, above the larynx. The larynx is above the trachea/windpipe.)Reflux=acidic or alkaline stomach material that backs up into the esophagus (food tube), causing any of these problems: VCD attacks, cough, voice problems, asthma, globus (feeling of lump in throat), constant need to clear throat, worsening of sinus condition, sore throat, pre-cancerous conditions of throat &/or esophagus, etc.SOME GER/LPR CONTROL THINGS WE DO, that we learned from the excellent book: STOMACH AILMENTS AND DIGESTIVE DISTURBANCES, by Michael T. Murray, N.D. See page 9, References, in my website: http://cantbreathesuspectvcd.com\u00a0\u00a0 and, also see GER/LPR info on page 5, and on LINKS page.PLEASE READ THIS GREAT BOOK. It may possibly be bought on-line, from Michael T. Murray",

    "question": "I posted a question earlier in the week asking for any information that would help out my grandma (she has diabetes). She came over my house today and told me that her stomach has been hurting her very badly. The doctor told her she needs to eat 3 carbohydrates with every meal. She told me she has been for the most part. But her diabetes nurse told her she has to take 1/2 of cups of stuff and she thinks her stomach has gotten smaller because she can't eat as much. Whenever she does eat her stomach hurts her later on. She hopes this does not continue because she is in pain. She would like to know if there is anything she can eat that won't upset her stomach or won't hurt her diabetes. I am looking on the internet for anything I can find. Any ideas would also be helpful. Thank you.",
