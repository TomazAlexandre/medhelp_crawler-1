            "answer": "Count me as a heavy water drinker. Since college, anyway. Admittedly, I rarely drink anything except water and tea, but I always have to plan to take water wherever I go.I always kind of worried in the back of my mind about diabetes, but have never had an abnormal glucose level (that I can tell--my PCP marked one as abnormal, but it was non-fasting and I think he overlooked that. It was only a tad over 100 anyway). When I was having all the pre-dx testing last year, I had a 2-hour blood glucose test, which was also very normal. Because I complained of dry eyes and mouth, I also got the blood test and lip biopsy for Sjogren's. Also normal.I still remember visiting somewhere in Japan many years ago and forgetting my water bottle when I left. One of the people there came chasing me down the road as he worried I might \"die without it\" (apparently since I was never seen without it).So I dunno, but I guess I'm a longstanding member of the perpetually thirsty club.sho",

            "answer": "Oh, my!!!\u00a0\u00a0No, my dear Watson, that intake and that number of urinations is NOT normal.Besides the usual culprits to be checked, diabetes mellitus and a UTI, there are other causes of what is known in medicine as \"polydypsia\" (frequent drinking - or being very \"dippy\", I guess) and \"polyuria\" (frequent urination - no glib remarks come to mind).The first that comes to mind is a disorder of the pituitary gland called Diabetes Insipidus.\u00a0\u00a0This is where the brain (pituitary gland) doesn't control the reabsorption of water by the kidneys correctly.\u00a0\u00a0Most of the urine we produce is more concentrated that our blood.\u00a0\u00a0The kidneys can't reabsorb water out of the filtered blood and the urine is very diluted.\u00a0\u00a0Vast amounts of urine are produced so you pee all the time and MUST drink huge amounts of water to keep from being dehydrated.\u00a0\u00a0 This can be very serious and must be checked out.\u00a0\u00a0One of the things they do is to check the first urine in the morning to see if it is more concentrated.\u00a0\u00a0This is treated by an Endocrinologist.Watson - do you awaken in the night to drink and pee?The other thing is called Psychogenic Polydipsia.\u00a0\u00a0For some reason the person feels the need to drink so much and as a consequence pees a lot.\u00a0\u00a0My Dad has this.\u00a0\u00a0The main side effect is that so much liquid is taken in that it can \"wash out\" some of the electrolytes, specifically sodium.So, you need to inform your doc (PCP) that you are doing this and ask to be evaluated.\u00a0\u00a0Do you hear me???\u00a0\u00a0Huh?\u00a0\u00a0Huh??Quix\u00a0\u00a0:))",

            "answer": "This gets more and more interesting. Before my uro-gyn exam on Thursday, I had to prepare by a strict measurement of 'inflow' and 'outflow' for 24 hours. I drank 127 ounces!\u00a0\u00a0Luckily the output was roughly the same.I asked the doctor if this was normal, also pointing out that I've had the A1C blood test for diabetes and came out fine. She agreed that this is an awful lot of fluid, but said it isn't necessarily a bad sign. I told her that it's been only during the past 3 years or so that this has been happening. In days of yore---WAY yore---I drank much less, and also urinated way less. I was famous for going only a few times a day.Well, now I guess I have to follow up with Quix's advice to Watson, although I don't seem any the worse for this extravaganza.ess",
