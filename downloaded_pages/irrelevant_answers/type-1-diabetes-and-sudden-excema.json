    "question": "I have had type 1 for 45 years-on pump, in good control. I suddenly (one month ago)developed severe excema on my body--everywhere except face and feet. I itch all the time! Drs gave me cortisone creams and Claritin.\u00a0\u00a0Not working.\u00a0\u00a0Could it be nutritional? Am seeing info relating excema to gastrointestinal problems.\u00a0\u00a0I had severe gastroparesis ten years ago, but with pump it has gotten better. I take protonix. Also chronic constipation for many years.\u00a0\u00a0Any suggestions? This is driving me nuts!",
