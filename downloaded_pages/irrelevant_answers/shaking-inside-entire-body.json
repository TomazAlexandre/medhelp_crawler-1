            "answer": "Hi, Thank you for the question. Your whole body vibration symptoms could be related to anxiety, diabetes, thyroid dysfunction, Vitamin B complex deficiency, neurological disorder or if you are any vibration jobs (like drilling etc). Nerve studies and nerve test may be helpful to further evaluate the condition. I would recommend evaluating the possibilities here with the help of a doctor. Further referral to a neurologist or endocrinologist may be required to assess the condition. Hope this information proves helpful to you. Take Care & Regards!!!",

            "answer": "Hello,I have done research on this condition, and have come to the realization that this may be stemming from perio-menopause. I have started taking some vitamin supplements, and they have helped tremendously. I hardly ever have the feeling now. I will agree however that stress may exacerbate it, and have been trying to keep my stress level under control. Thanks for responding.",
