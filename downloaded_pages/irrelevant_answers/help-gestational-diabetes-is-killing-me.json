            "answer": "I was diabetic before pregnancy. And when I discovered I was pregnant I had to really watch what I ate. Eat 6 small meals a day. It helps you not become super hungry where you overload on stuff your not supposed to eat. I don't have and meal or snack ideas. I just load up on protein and watch my carbs. So for instance if it's tacos for dinner I would just change it up to a taco salad all the meat and cheese veggie fixings with a tortilla or a serving of rice on the side. I love mexican food and it kills me not being able to eat a bunch of taquitos or tacos. Lol. You'll get threw it. Just have to sacrifice a bit.",

            "answer": "I totally understand! I was diagnosed early as well and started shedding weight like crazy. Also had a total meltdown one night because i just wanted to 'eat normal' lol. There are some great recipes out there for diabetics. Try some chilis or chicken quesadilla soup with just a few tortillas on the side, maybe. I find baking with splenda really cuts down carbs without killing the flavor, as well. and find a good nutritionist. Mine has been amazing and has really worked with me to find foods that i like and crave that will work on my diet.",
