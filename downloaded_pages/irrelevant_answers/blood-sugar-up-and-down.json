            "answer": "Thank you both of you, Super_sally and WaveRider.I was diagnosed as a diabetes type II few years ago.\u00a0\u00a0Which Metformin was not working for me.\u00a0\u00a0It caused me very short of breath and unable to function as my normal life.\u00a0\u00a0The Endo doctor prescribes Minidiab for me.\u00a0\u00a0It works very well or may be over-well.\u00a0\u00a0Always after taking 2.5mg of minidiab, I need to take some sweets to boost up my sugar level.\u00a0\u00a0Otherwise, I'll shake, nause, sweaty and feel faint.\u00a0\u00a0When my BS (blood sugar) reaches 5.2, I also have those symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0My normal Hba1c is around 7 - 7.7.\u00a0\u00a0My GP said it is no good.\u00a0\u00a0I didn't take minidiab regulary.\u00a0\u00a0My endo dr said, only take 2.5mg with large meal.\u00a0\u00a0Normal meal I don't need to take it.I try to limit to one visit per year to my endo doctor.\u00a0\u00a0She needs me to pay out of pocket which I can't afford that at the moment.\u00a0\u00a0(Before was bulk bill = no out of packet payment needed).\u00a0\u00a0I see so many doctors, it adds up.\u00a0\u00a0Now, I try to figure it out myself at home to avoid all those doctors' bill.I'm curious.\u00a0\u00a0Am I diabetes or not?\u00a0\u00a0What happen, if my BS raise to 17.8, I go to sleep without taking any minidiab?\u00a0\u00a0Would next morning I wake up, it could fall back to normal or not?

            "answer": "I'm not familiar with the Aussie health care system nor the area you reside in. Hopefully you may be able to pursue changing doctors to one that is a little more understanding of your financial handicap.After rereading your post several times, I find your A1c very high and the 17.8 deadly. The latter could cause cardiac arrest. Both numbers imply you have diabetes, especially the A1c. In order to best help you, I have broken my response down into several subject sections.A. MedicationMinidiab in the USA are dispensed under the name of Glypizide or Glucotrol. Blindly taking medication without knowing the consequences can be harmful. I am not the one nor any health board member the one to tell you what/when/how of dosage you should consume. Only your endo should do this. But in any case your medication is need of modification. You may need to start injecting insulin, possible slow reacting to keep you glucose levels in check.Are you on other medications that may have interactions or contraintdictions with Minidiab? Go here and compare the results with all your meds. Include supplements too.\u00a0\u00a0http://tinyurl.com/PikaPikas-checker2. NutritionProper nutrition goes a long way in keeping your blood glucose in check. Google search 'diabetes nutrition' for suggestions. Try not to consume fruits or fruit juices by themselves, eat starchy or high carbohydrated foods as they turn into sugar after being digested. Understand that a healthy nutrition is not the same as diabetic nutrition. Diabetics must avoid and abstain from eating sugary foods & liquids, starches and bad carbs like white flour, Period. Read all package and canned food nutrition labels. Sugars from carbohydrates equals one heaping Tablespoon of refined sugar for every 7 grams listed.3. Exercise & WeightDo some sort of physical exercise 20 minutes a day. It's Spring down under so go for long brisk walks, ride a bicycle, park at the far end of the parking lot and walk to the entrance. This helps to burn of excess blood glucose, really does.Losing a few pounds goes a long way. A few pounds over is not good. Try to maintain normal weight through nutrition and exercise. No late night snacking.4. TestingThis is the key to controlling your blood glucose levels.Test times:a.) At bedtime and first thing in the morning. First thing in the morning before breakfast - no consuming colored liquids like tea or coffee - to see if your liver is producing excess blood glucose while sleeping. Compare against your bedtime result. And to get a baseline measurement to compare against after meal test results.b.) Test 2-3 hours after you eat when blood glucose are at the highest level in your body. Compare against prandial [b4 meal] result. This helps you to understand what the foods you ate does to your blood glucose levels. Avoid foods that raise your levels above normal. [see below for ranges].Perform 'a' and 'b' for every meal.Normal b4 breakfast [prandial] ranges 70-99 mg/dlAfter meal [postprandial] <180 mg/dl or better <140 mg/dl.< means less than.Finally, as Sally said \"You need to educate yourself well on diabetes and do everything necessary to improve your situation.\" There a wealth of information on the Internet at your fingertips.",
