            "answer": "CINDY,Sorry to hear of your symptoms.While it is possible that the terazosin, zaroxolyn, lisinopril-HCTZ, or Toprol could be leading to fatigue, you would want to exclude other reasons for the fatigue.A full history and physical make sense as the first step.\u00a0\u00a0Other pssible tests to undergo might include an exercise treadmill test, an echocardiogram, standard lab tests and pulmonary function studies.\u00a0\u00a0The source of fatigue can be from many things: thyroid disease, anemia, deconditioning, coronary artery disease, heart failure, low blood pressure, COPD -- to just name a few.See your doctor to help sort this out.Hope that helps.",

    "question": "I am a 70-year-old man who received a pacemaker in October 2002. I have also been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and I have high blood pressure and BPH. The following are the medications I am taking. The problem is that I have no energy whatsoever and I will start to feel good for a day or two and then I feel lousy with no energy and can hardly walk across the room without giving out. This has been going on for over a year now.I have been given every test it seems and I am concerned that my medication may be the problem. I am currently taking:Terazosin - 2mg (2 daily)Zaroxolyn - 2.5 mg (1 daily)Lisinop-HCTZ - 20-25m (1 daily)Glucotrol XL - 5 mg (1 daily)Toprol XL - 100 mg (1 daily)Any advice or feedback concerning drug interaction or taking too much stuff for high blood pressure would be helpful. I am at a loss for answers at this point. Thank you.",
