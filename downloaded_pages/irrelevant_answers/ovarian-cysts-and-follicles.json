            "answer": "hi becky and everyone. i too have pcos. it affects my fertility but i know people who have still gone onto have children with no problems. i went on clomid but this did not work for me. i went onto many other fertilty helps after this. it was when i was ivf i had a greater understanding and was also able to have a look at my ovaries. i had a pearl necklace effect around the one ovary filled with cysts but my womb was beautiful. well thats what the doc said anyway. i was put on metformin whilst under her care. it was brilliant although used for diabetes it had a huge effect on my body which helped loads. my weight was managed my facial hair and acne reduced and i had loads of energy. also with ivf folicles were responding well. though when your on ivf they\u00a0\u00a0take it more carefully. Alhtough after 3 failed attempts of ivf the drugs did help and it gave me the bestchance for me. there were a few girls on ivf the same time as me it did work for though. the only thing is now im no longer on ivf and my gp wont prescribe metformin as i dont have diabtetes. so all the symtoms i have come back . my advice is get on the net and do your research most important you are not alone big hug to you",

Im only telling you to check it out cause I posted a message for the doctor about my u/s report and she said something like follicles are normal and you have them for your eggs or something like that. DONT QUOTE ME just go to the forum and I left it a week or two ago so it might be on the 6-7 page, My name is mandyclar.I just thought i'd leave this info so you can see exactly what she said about follicles.I wish you luck.
