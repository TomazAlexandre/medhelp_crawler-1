            "answer": "No, that would not be the cause of high BP.\u00a0\u00a0You say she checks her BP regularely and its in the normal range going by what you posted then its not from high BP.\u00a0\u00a0Some people when they BP is extremely elevated their blood vessels in their eyes can leak, that happened to me one time and I did not even know it, but the eye doctor detected it, it was way in the back of the eye.\u00a0\u00a0It was a very small leak and had not effected my eyesight yet.You say the eye doctor said that \"there was something detached in her eye\", him being the eye doctor, the Specialist in that field is he/she not doing anything about it?\u00a0\u00a0Or refer her to an Opthamalogist, if he/she was not one themselves?I still think she needs to see a doctor about her left side feeling weaker than normal\u00a0\u00a0as you stated above.Diabetes can also do a number on the eyes.\u00a0\u00a0A friend of mine got several eye problems due to diabetes, but her eye doctor took care/is taking care of it.Have a talk with your mother's eye doctor, and ask him/her what the next step should be.",

    "question": "My mother is 56 yrs old and has developed a blood spot of blood in her left eye and have complained of her left side feeling weaker than normal. She has gained 15 pnds over the last several months and have been feeling a little more fatigue than usual. The irritation of her eye is what bothers her the most . She almost feels as if there is something loose in her eye. What is the cause of that and is it an accumulation of problems? She has high blood pressure and diabetes but usually has a very low pulse rate ranging from 50- 60 at times.",
