            "answer": "If I were in your shoes, I would visit my doctor and present these same questions to him/her. Something is not right and your body is telling you that. And so are you or you wouldn't be posting here. Don't ignore these facts because it is a \"sometime\" occurrence.

    "question": "Hello,I'm a 27 year-old male, ~165 lbs, 6''. I'm in decent shape, smoker (around 3 to 5 cigarettes a day), pretty healthy diet. (vegan diet)Over the last four or five years, I've developed a few issues that I've simply ignored. None of these cause me any immediate concern, but they affect my attention and happiness, so I would _love_ to resolve them.* My vision is frequently blurry. Sometimes, after drinking something sweet (e.g., juice, beer), it clears up a little.* My legs tingle a lot, and are frequently sore. (They distract me when I'm trying to concentrate.)* I get hungover when I drink very little. If I have a beer or two, I \"crash\" a little time later (tired and groggy rest of day), so I only drink as my last activity of the day* I am hungry _all_ the time, and am never satiated. I eat a _lot_. (My roommates are convinced that I eat as much as the two of them combined.)* I'm very irritable, particularly between my frequently snacks.* I'm losing my attention a lot, probably my greatest concern. I just started a career as a software developer, and its sometimes a great challenge to concentrate.* A little frightening: I'm increasingly more \"attracted\" to drinking. I'm not an alcoholic (I drink once or twice a week), I find myself craving sweet things, particularly beer, increasingly more. I've made it a point to stay away from the bars, but it is all my friends do. I've made it a point to drink less, but I have a difficult time controlling my drinking once I start (as in after my first beer, I abandon my plans to drink only a few.)* Some depression. (This has always been an issue for me as well as for my father, so it may be unrelated.) I'm not \"depressed\" as in suicidal; but I frequently lose all interest in everythingAll of these intuitively feel related, since they have all seemed to develop together.Any ideas? Does it seem like diabetes or hypoglycemia? Any other possibilities? I would see a doctor if it seems like it would be fruitful, but am so busy between work and school, which eats up standard office hours. Thanks!",
