            "answer": "Thank you so much for the response! I hope its nothing serious, also. Yikes. Did your husband have a growth or something on his kidney? or just high protein levels? What were the symptoms of what he has, if there were any? It sure scares me to think that something could really be wrong with me. I mean, the diabetes was a shock...I have 4 little ones and i want to be around for them! :( I am going to try to get into the doc today and find out something. Keep your fingers crossed for me! (please) and I hope your hubby is ok.",

Were casts present in the urine? Are there RBC's\u00a0\u00a0in the urine significant enough for a hematuria ( >5 /hpf)?You may need blood tests to determine serum creatinine and BUN levels. Your glomerular filtration rate has to be ascertained.Discuss this with your physician and keep us posted regarding his advice.",

    "question": "I was to the doctor a few days ago...I have diabetes (type 2) just recently diagnosed. I don't have high blood sugars or anything, I mean they are higher than normal peoples...they don't normally go over 180. I was told by my doctor that I have a high amount of protein in my urine (the number she told me was 123 ?) She said she doesn't think that my blood sugars are causing it, so does anyone know what my problem could possibly be? I am 29 and in otherwise good shape. Any help would be great.
