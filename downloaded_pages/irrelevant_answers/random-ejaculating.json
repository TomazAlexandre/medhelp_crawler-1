            "answer": "If you are never having sex and never masterbating, maybe its just dribbling out because it has to go somewhere. If you aren't getting off, start jerking off to clear it. If you are getting off and this is happening, then go have a doctor check it because you might have an infection.",

    "question": "I've suddenly got a problem where I kind of feel a slight urge to urinate, but when I squeeze what actually comes out is ejaculate. I had not been horny or watching anything even remotely sexual and I was ejaculating, I did not get any sensation or orgasm either, It was almost as thought it were just leaking out on its own. Does anyone know if there's something wrong?",
