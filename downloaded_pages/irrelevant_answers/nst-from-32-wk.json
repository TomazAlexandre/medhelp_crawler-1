            "answer": "From my understanding, generally NST is used that early when you or baby may be a higher risk. I have been getting them since 32 weeks twice a week, and will continue until I deliver. I have a genetic connective tissue disorder that gives me a slightly higher risk of premature labor and rupture of membranes. All an NST consists of is you being hooked up to a contraction monitor for at least fifteen minutes. It stands for non stress test. It measures any contractions you may be having, baby's heart rate and baby's movements. They give you a button to push every time you feel baby move. Its a cake walk. Good luck.",
