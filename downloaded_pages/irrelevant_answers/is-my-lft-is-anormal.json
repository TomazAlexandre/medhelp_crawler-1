            "answer": "Your LFT shows some high readings. Normal values for SGOT is 0-35, SGPT is 4-36, ALP is 30-120, Bilirubin is 0.3-1.0, Gamma Glutamyl Ttansferase (GGT) is 8-38.\u00a0\u00a0This definately could be a sign of early cirrhosis of the liver from excessive alchol consumption.Also, you could have some issues with your gallbladder or pancreas that can elevate liver enzymes. If you have any other symptoms such as abdominal pain, difficulty with eating fatty foods or nausea you may have tests to check for those diseases.I also suggest you stop drinking completely. Have the doctor retest your liver function in a month and see if they have come down.",

            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.Elevation of your liver enzymes could be due to fatty liver changes. Fatty liver can be due to alcoholism when it is called Alcoholic fatty liver disease and the other one is Non alcoholic fatty liver disease, which is due to obesity, diabetes and high triglyceride levels. This can progress to cirrhosis of the liver and can be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma. So, prevention or cure is by avoiding alcohol and treating diabetes, obesity and high triglyceride levels. So, don't worry and discuss these options with your doctor.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",
