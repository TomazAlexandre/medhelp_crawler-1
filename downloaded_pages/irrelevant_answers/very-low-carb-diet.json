            "answer": "I know many diabetics, Sally, both types, who use a very low carb diet (following Dr. Bernstein's regimen which is, I believe 30 grams a day) with great success. Some people use that diet to stave off using medication for as long as possible; some for longterm management of numbers with less need for meds and insulin. I myself only eat a \" moderate low\" diet of about 100 carbs per day. That is a choice for me as I'm a vegetarian and love cooking gourmet meals and it would be almost impossible to go much lower without losing what I love. If you want, send me a PM and I'll give you two websites where you can read and talk to many of these people. (I'm not allowed to include these in posts).",
