    "question": "For over a year now I have extreme brain numbness - I feel like I am going to pass out but I never do- I don't get the spinning dizzy feeling, more a detached from reality feeling.\u00a0\u00a0This happens when I stand, sit, lie, or walk - I have not driven my car for a year cause I don't feel in control.\u00a0\u00a0sometimes my legs don't seem to be in time with my brain when I am walking and I get the tube home from work but often stumble off it in an almost confused state!!\u00a0\u00a0I have a lot of hot flushes and am always tired.\u00a0\u00a0I have a borderline thyroid and have had extensive endocrine testing due to family history - I keep showing signs of Diabetes but the more detailed tests all come back ok.\u00a0\u00a0I am slightly hypoglycemic but whenever these attacks occur my blood sugar is normal.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor is now referring me to ENT which will probably take a while but in the meantime my life is on hold!\u00a0\u00a0- I am 38 years old - have 2 children and 4 years ago had an ovary and tube taken out.\u00a0\u00a0I developed acne not long after.\u00a0\u00a0I am apparantly not menopausal.\u00a0\u00a0Could an ENT problem cause me the above problems?\u00a0\u00a0If so how can I best control it whilst waiting for my referral?",
