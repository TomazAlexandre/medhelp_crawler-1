            "answer": "Hi, carvedilol is a beta blocker and is\u00a0\u00a0indicated for the treatment of mild-to-severe chronic heart failure. Lisinopril is angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor, used to treat hypertension and heart failure, So, check with your doctor why the medications have been prescribed, it may not be for hypertension alone. Light headedness could be due to postural hypotension, wherein upon standing blood pooling occurs in the legs and the brain is deprived of adequate blood supply and oxygenation. This is more common in the elderly and in people with diabetes mellitus. So, don't worry and discuss these options with your doctor. Regards.",

    "question": "I am really confused between carvidilol and lisopril.About six weeks ago my blood pressure suddenly went up (170/80). As a precaution I went to emergency. They took EKG, X-rays, MRI of the brain and did blood work. Doctors in emergency could not find any problem with my heart and\u00a0\u00a0gave me one dose\u00a0\u00a0of antianxiety medicine and sent me home. Also advised me to see your cardiologist.Cardiologist prescribed me carvidilol (6.25mg), Lisinopril (5mg) and Pravastatin. My blood pressure was never more than 140/80 before taking the carvidilol once a day and lisonopril once in a day. I am 71 year old and thought 140/80 is normal for my age. But I took the carvi-lisono 6 hours apart. Carvi causes me light headed for hours and lisonopril caused me short breath and weakness. So I decided to stop lisonopril completely and by doing it caused lot of palpitation and discomfort. Right now I am only taking carvi once in a day. I feel that I don't have any heart disease but these medication making me sick. Please comment. Thanks.",
