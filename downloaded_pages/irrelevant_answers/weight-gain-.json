            "answer": "I'm not very far along yet, so I can't give a comparison, but my focus has been just to eat as much healthy, nutrient dense food as possible while eating less sugar and simple carbs. I'm mainly doing it to control blood sugar. If you're eating things that are good for you and baby and don't have gestational diabetes, you probably shouldn't worry unless your doctor says otherwise. If you were underweight before getting pregnant, more gain is normal.\u00a0\u00a0You don't want to deprive the baby either, so the only change I would recommend is a focus on healthy choices rather than calorie restriction.",

            "answer": "It depends on how your are feeling. My doctor will advise me to eat whatever I can keep down if I'm nauseous. Even if that is french fries of bread, then so be it.If you're feeling great and you can eat anything, the way to control weight gain is to stay within your allotted calorie count or cut the carbs. Friends of mine that had to eliminate carbs due to gestational diabetes barely put on weight. So there is proof it works. You can incorporate some exercise to your daily routine too like walking or yoga.But you do gain a lot in the second trimester and not all of it is fat. Your blood volume increases, your breast get bigger, your baby gets bigger, more amniotic fluid. If your doctor is not worried, you don't really need to be either.",
