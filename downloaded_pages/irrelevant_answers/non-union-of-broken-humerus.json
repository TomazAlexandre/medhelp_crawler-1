            "answer": "Hi,Thanks for writing in. The common risk factors for non union of humerus fracture are open fracture, highly comminuted fracture pattern, significant displacement of the fracture fragments, smoking, diabetes, NSAID\u2019s, infection and hypothyroidism.In your case, smoking could have aided in non union of the fracture, but there is a need to rule out other causes as well.Any surgery the previous one you got done or the revision surgery your doctor has advised requires that you quit smoking for it to heal. Proven results are less in case of bone stimulator.The treatment for non union, usually involves plate fixation as exchange IM nailing gives poor results.Hope this information helps.Take care.",

    "question": "11 weeks ago I fractured my left-humerus (clean in half, mid-bone but little closer to elbow) while bench pressing at the gym using heavy dumbbell weights.\u00a0\u00a0It has now been 2.5 months (in a cast at first then sling/brace) and still no-union of bone but my arm does feel much better.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor said that he did see some minimal amount of callus formation a few weeks ago but on yesterday's x-ray he said it looks worse than it did three weeks ago which is really dissapointing news to me.\u00a0\u00a0At this stage of the game my orthopedic surgeon is suggesting an operation to secure the bone with a plate and screws.\u00a0\u00a0I live in Toronto, Canada so the surgery would cost me nothing.\u00a0\u00a0I have a few questions regarding my situation below which I'd really appreciate input with:1) I am a smoker (1 pack a day) and was wondering if quitting or stopping smoking could benefit me with the healing of my bone.\u00a0\u00a0I read that smoking significantly delays or even prevents certain fractures from healing and I'm wondering if I stop now will my chances of non-invasive healing improve? If so, by how much? Does anyone have any experiences where they stopped smoking and started noticing improvements with their fracture? Frankly put, I'm really not in the mood to give up smoking at this stressfull time in my life but if this let's me walk away from this injury \"surgery-free\" I am willing to do it.2) Will reducing smoking to 3 cigarettes a day from 25 per day promote improved fracture healing or do I need to stop completely to improve my chances of union?3) Has anyone ever experiences a delayed or non-union of the bone (particularly humerus) and if so what actions did you take? Did you have surgery? Did it heal on it's own eventually? If surgery, how was your outcome and recovery (down) time like?4) Lastly, my orthopedic surgeon suggested a \"Bone growth stimulator\" as an alternative to try prior to committing to an operation.\u00a0\u00a0It's relatively expensive $3,500 for the treatment but it's not certain it will even work at all.\u00a0\u00a0Anyone have any success with this device? Should I try it?I'd really appreciate any input on this guys, I'm really growing increasingly depressed with my situation.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks in advance!",
