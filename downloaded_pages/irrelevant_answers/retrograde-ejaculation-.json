    "question": "My husband has retrograde ejaculation and I was reading on the internet that taking sudafed or some type of antihystemine would help that problem. Is that true? We are trying to concieve a child and that's when we ran into this problem. They tested his semen and said they found no sperm in his semen at all. So the doctor says he could have retrograde ejaculation. We don't have much money and would really like to have a baby but can't afford all the fertility treatments. Could you please tell me if taking sudafed would work? And do we have any hope of conceiving a child? Thank you!",
