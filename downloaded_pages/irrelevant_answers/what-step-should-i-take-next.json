            "answer": "Hi there,I'm sorry to hear you've had such a scary experience, it doesn't sound like fun.Right; you probably won't like what I'm about to suggest, but I can't believe none of your doctors have pointed it out and it needs to be addressed.\u00a0\u00a0You are four years older than me, one inch taller - and you weigh more than twice what I do.\u00a0\u00a0My BMI is 21 (bang in the middle of the healthy range), and my body fat is 24% (female athletes are usually around 15%), so please don't write me off as an anorexic or something.The excess weight you are carrying is putting tremendous strain on your organs, but most particularly on your heart and lungs.\u00a0\u00a0This is why you experience problems at night; your lungs and heart are literally being crushed under your own weight.Even without the family history you describe, you are putting yourself at high risk of arthritis, heart disease and diabetes, and increasing your risk of cancer (Huntingdon's is genetic though - you either have it or you don't).\u00a0\u00a0Since you have three kids who rely on you, it is even more important that you address this problem - partly so you can stick around for them, and partly so you can make sure they don't grow up to have the same problems.For someone of your size, care needs to be taken when getting in shape; it's not as simple as jumping on a treadmill because you may already have heart and joint problems - please don't do anything until you have consulted your doctor.Go back to your doctor and tell him that you want to get to a healthy weight. He should carry out some basic tests (although it sounds like many of them have been done already), and then give you a diet and exercise plan.\u00a0\u00a0For you it will be all about gradual changes; I would expect you would start with a moderate calorie-cut and a daily half-hour brisk walk, for example.\u00a0\u00a0Then, as your weight drops and your fitness improves, you should be able to increase your activity and make more changes. Involve your kids, and whenever you struggle with motivation just think about their needs - they need you to be around for many more years, and they need you to set a good example so they don't end up with the same weight problems.I don't mean this to sound harsh, but all the problems you describe could be due simply to your weight. Even if there is an underlying problem (although it sounds like there probably isn't), it will be hugely exacerbated by the stress you are placing on your body through being so overweight.\u00a0\u00a0I'm not just preaching as a \"skinny\" either; I've had to lose around 35 pounds myself over the last couple of years, so I know it can be done.All the best with everything; and if you do decide to address your weight issue (no one can force you, after all), stay in touch and let me know how you're getting on.\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes. :)",

            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!You have gone through a number of tests. I would suggest you get the blood levels of the following checked if they have not already been checked: potassium, calcium, sodium, magnesium, vitamin B complex, or vitamins B1, B3, or B6 and Vitamin D. Get your kidney function, parathyroid gland function and adrenal function tests done because these affect the electrolyte balance in the body. Stress, alcohol, caffeine and fatigue all cause similar symptoms. Certain sleep disorders and peripheral nerve disorders due to diabetes or hypothyroidism can also be the cause.Hope this helps. Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

            "answer": "While being at a healthy weight is always a good place to be, I think there are many other tests that can be done to find the reason for your symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0I've lost more weight than I care to admit to, and it hasn't done much for my situation.\u00a0\u00a0However, I am in my position because of a super virus that took about 3 years to get rid of .It doesn't matter what kind of doctor you go see, they will tell you to start by trying weight loss.\u00a0\u00a0Once you have your weight reasonably in check, then they will dig deeper.\u00a0\u00a0Too many people fall between the medical cracks because they start out overweight, or they are smokers, or drink too much alcohol.\u00a0\u00a0One thing I've heard about too, is some people who have had the super virus are told they need a shrink.\u00a0\u00a0So, there are as many excuses for your symptoms as there are people to have them.Don't be too hard on yourself, and try to work with the doctor.\u00a0\u00a0Weight isn't gained overnight, and it won't dissappear that quickly either.Just FYI, I lost lots of weight, and have a BMI of 24.5, and I still have a very weak heart with enlarged vessels coming from the top of it,\u00a0\u00a0am in stage 4 heart failure, and stage 5 kidney failure, all caused by the super virus.\u00a0\u00a0Weight loss didn't change my situation at all, and I start dialysis on July 6th.\u00a0\u00a0Then, in August or September, I'll be implanted with a diffibulator for my heart.Be kind to yourself, eat sensibly, and don't go without.\u00a0\u00a0Going without will just serve to set you up for failure.\u00a0\u00a0Think of it as a \"lifestyle\" change, and NOT a diet.\u00a0\u00a0I think you will get much further with that mind set.\u00a0\u00a0Once you have lost a few pounds, then the excercise should become more appealing.\u00a0\u00a0Just listen to your body and try not to shake up your world too much, to quickly.\u00a0\u00a0Your body will let you know if you can do more, or need to do less, the important part is to do \"something\".I hope success for you.",

I went into the ER last week with shortness of breath, Chest Pain, Tightening of the chest, Pain in the left side, back of neck and head pain,leg pain. I have had anxiety attacks before, and this seemed a lot different, because I wasn't doing anything but sleeping.

It was all normal, but the ER doctor admitted me for further tests, They did two stress tests, Holter was placed on me, blood work all normal. I asked the doctor if it was due to stress he said no, and might be something else causing it.\u00a0\u00a0He wouldn't let me back at work\u00a0\u00a0until I seen him in his office.\u00a0\u00a0I thought I was okay to start doing stuff around the house, and ended back at the hospital with the same problem. But they sent me home, and told me to follow up with him.\u00a0\u00a0I went to his office and he looked everything over, and said I could do Cather test, and told me he wanted to talk to me and my husband about. I went told my husband to come in, and then he just told us it might be stress, and he not going to do the test.\u00a0\u00a0I asked him about my legs, because the whole time no one ever looked at them.\u00a0\u00a0There are heart problems , Cancer, Diabetes, Hungtingtons , Arthrisis in my family.
