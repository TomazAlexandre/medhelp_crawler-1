That I do remember.\u00a0\u00a0Dr. Scott Zashin told me at the time I needed to have my symtoms treated as the came up and I needed to be monitored for LUPUS.\u00a0\u00a0As far as under the chin swelling, yeap, I know it is my glands and not fluid or \"fat\". When the fluid in my face goes down you can still feel the swollen glands.\u00a0\u00a0every once in a while they hurt.\u00a0\u00a0 The reason I take fluid pills is because I littereally stay swollen all over.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes the swelling isn't from fluid.\u00a0\u00a0I have lost all my energy.",
