            "answer": "Did you ever learn what was wrong? I have just been diagnosed with diabetes. I suddenly put on weight at memopause - BIG TIME WEIGHT. My thyroid is high but within normal range and the doctor will do nothing. I am urinating with a full bladder every hour, but this is not due to the diabetese because I am only just diabetic and do not require medication. There is no glucose in the urine. So this is not the cause.My stomach, like yours is extremely distended. It is not just fat. There is plenty of fat but, beneath the fat is a distended midriff area. I have had bright red blood from the bowel for many years now, and feel it is haemerrhoids. If it were anything else, I think I would be dead after 20 years. It cannot be coming from the stomach because the blood is red. It is coming from the \"tail\" end of the alimentary canal.I am wondering what can be causing all of these symptoms.",

    "question": "Ive had an extremely distended stomach for about 3 months now. It doesn't really change with bowel habits or anything. It nevers fluctuates at all.I also have frequent urination problems and void a large amount of urine everyday.A pelvic ultra sound was done and a quarter size irregular ovarian cyst was found, however the gyn said that was not causing my problems?!?!Blood test revealed high(out of normal range) total protein, albumin, monocytes and cholesterol.glucose was in pre-diabetic range.I am incredibly frustrated, the MD told me that I have IBS and dismissed the results of all the lab work and ovarian cyst.Any help would be appreciated!Thanks",
