I'm currently on 62.5mcgs.\u00a0\u00a0I've always thought the baseline starting # was based on weight right after surgery and then it's tweeked along by symptoms and target TSH #'s .The constipation can be from hypo symptoms even though your TSH they say is normal .. if your doc ups the dosage it may go away like mine.C~",
