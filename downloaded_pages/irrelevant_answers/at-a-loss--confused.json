    "question": "I had my first Grand-mal seizure in July 2010. I am 49 yrs old. Since then every time my blood work comes back with a high alcohol content, as high as .17. I do not drink, as I choose to break the \"cycle\" of a family of alcoholics no matter how hard. I do not use over-the-counter meds, or mouthwases, or cook with alcohol, as I stay away from all forms.\u00a0\u00a0Does anyone know what can be causing this? My drs. say it is not my meds.",
