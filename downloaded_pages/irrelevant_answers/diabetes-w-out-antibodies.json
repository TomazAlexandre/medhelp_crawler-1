            "answer": "His symptoms were extreme thirst, hunger and bed wetting(something he didn't do even when he was being potty trained).\u00a0\u00a0He lost about 1lb.\u00a0\u00a0When I took him to his Pediatrician just to see what was going on with him they rushed us to the Peds. ER.\u00a0\u00a0He did not have ketones but his BS level was over 400 and his HBA1C level was 11.\u00a0\u00a0Now, he has gained 3lbs and his HBA1C level is 8.6.\u00a0\u00a0So I guess it is really early.\u00a0\u00a0I have a 7 year old and I know she has a chance of developing diabetes but I don't know if I should test her.\u00a0\u00a0One doctor said to test her and others said to just look out for the signs llike I did with my son.\u00a0\u00a0Thanks!",

            "answer": "Thanks for the information.\u00a0\u00a0I'd agree that you just may be early on.\u00a0\u00a0Those are essentially the same symptoms and numbers that my daughter had at diagnosis, we never asked if she had anti-bodies or not.\u00a0\u00a0We have our endo appointment tomorrow morning, I'm going to ask.",

            "answer": "Also, your other children have the same chance to develop diabetes as your son.\u00a0\u00a0That is both good news and bad news, as your son has been diagnosed, but the rate of diagnosis in kids is 1 in every 500.\u00a0\u00a0So the chances are low.\u00a0\u00a0But I would still test.\u00a0\u00a0There is a national study going on that will test you and your child's siblings for free just for participating (if you qualify).\u00a0\u00a0Here's the info:http://www2.diabetestrialnet.org/We took part in the study, and I'd recommend anyone to participate.",

    "question": "My 5 yr. old son was diagnosed with Type 1 Diabetes one month ago. When we had our first Dr.'s appt. she told us that he did not have the antibodies for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0What does this mean?\u00a0\u00a0Will he eventually stop needing injections or should I request other test for some other health issue?\u00a0\u00a0We did \"catch\" the diabetes early..before any complications but she didn't explain well why he didn't have the antibodies and said we would test again in 1 year.Any suggested information would be appreciated.Thanks!",
