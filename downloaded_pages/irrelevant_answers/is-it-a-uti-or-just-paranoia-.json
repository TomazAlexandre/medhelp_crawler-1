            "answer": "Cranberry juice is good, however if it is the Cocktail variety it will have a lot of sugar, and yeast feeds on sugar, as does bacteria so it would be good to drink lots of water and maybe get yourself some cranberry pills instead or drink the straight, it is awful, but you can dilute it, 100% cranberry extract juice. My mother in law had this a lot, but she had an underlying condition leading her to believe she had UTI. Antibiotics didn't help.Ask your dr for other reasons for bladder problems...have you checked for diabetes?Maybe a kidney infection?Talk to dr. Untreated or chronic infections are bad for kidneys as they try to filter.Cheerz",

    "question": "I'm kind of confused on whether I have a UTI or not. For the past couple months I've had to urinate more frequent ( particularly around the time of ovulation; around every 4 hours along with a pressure to go more ), but then it will go back more-so normal. I've been having a burning ( mildly ) in my pee for a week or two, but it seems like it's only like that if I haven't been drinking enough fluids, however, when it does, it stays after I use it. The urine isn't cloudy, but a light yellow or clear depending on how much I've drank. . . I also suspected that I might have another yeast infection, so I'm using plain yogurt to keep that under control. Also, I've started drinking cranberry juice to help flush any bacteria that might be in my urinary tract..",
