            "answer": "About 80% of heart issues are detectable by ultrasound. It is so hard not to worry. I can tell you this my god daughter had some major heart issues along with little things like a heart murmur and they all cleared up by her 1st birthday. I was born with a heart murmur as well, but no longer have it. Try not to worry... You are almost there and if something is present at birth the pediatrician will pick up on it right away. There is really nothing that I know that you can do to change it.",

    "question": "I am 33 weeks and 1 day pregnant. I have had a perfectly normal pregnancy so far (except for a glucose test that was a little high; the 3 hour test cleared me for gestational diabetes). I recently developed an iron deficiency at about 28 weeks which I take iron supplements for now. Now, at my last appointment a couple of days ago, my ob noticed that my sons heartbeat was irregular. There is (what she described as) a pre-beat before each regular beat. She referred me to a specialist and he pretty much told me the same thing. Everything that I have read on the subject has said that this is nothing to be too concerned about right now. That these things usually resolve before or shortly after birth. I am trying not to worry (especially since all of these potential problems are coming up at once) and my husband is doing a great job of trying to keep me calm. I am doing ok so far. But I can't seem to find any information on the causes related to irregular heartbeats in unborn babies. What I really want to know is what causes these irregularities and if there is anything I can do to help resolve the issue before my son is born. I would also like to know what the chances are that this will resolve before (or even right after) birth and how often is it something more serious. How will my ob (or the specialist) tell? The specialist said that he did not see any structural abnormalities but they can't always tell from the ultrasound. How often do structural abnormalities go undetected until after birth and do structural abnormalities cause irregular heart beats? I know that this is a lot of information but I figured that I would learn more from actually talking to people rather than scowering for the exact answers to my questions (which seem to be more illusive than one might think). This is my way of dealing with this issue. Although I have been told not to worry too much, I think every pregnant woman/mother would agree that this is impossible and the more I know about this abnormality the better I can deal with it and calm down haha.Thank you in advance for any information you can provide. It means more to me than you will ever know!",
