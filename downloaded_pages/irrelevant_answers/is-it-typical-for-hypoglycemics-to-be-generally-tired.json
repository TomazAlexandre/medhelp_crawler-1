            "answer": "Dear Brookies,I am a volunteer with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation and the Mom of a 16 year old who has had diabetes since the age of 21 months.\u00a0\u00a0I am not a medical professional, so any information that I give you should be verified with your physician and dietician.You don't mention your blood sugar readings in your e-mail, so I am not sure how you have determined that your lack of energy is due to hypoglycemia.\u00a0\u00a0It sounds as if you are trying to follow your dietician's advice, but maybe I can help you by sharing some of the helpful hints that I have come across in the past 14 years that we have been living with diabetes in my house.Check labels carefully for carbs and avoid the simple sugars.\u00a0\u00a0The timing of your meals is also very important to maintain blood sugars at the proper level.\u00a0\u00a0This will reduce the chance of hypoglycemic emergencies.\u00a0\u00a0You should avoid skipping meals.\u00a0\u00a0If you are unable to eat your full meal on time, be sure you eat a snack as soon as possible to keep your blood sugar in balance.Also, when you dance or exercise, you should try adding extra food to your meal plan to maintain blood glucose control.\u00a0\u00a0May I suggest checking your blood sugars prior to physical activity?\u00a0\u00a0My daughter is a soccer player, and she has been advised by her endocrinologist to check her blood sugar prior to exercise as well as during a game.\u00a0\u00a0It can be dangerous exercising without knowing what your blood sugar level is.\u00a0\u00a0There are blood glucose monitors out there that are free if you purchase the test strips, so if you don't already have one, you should consider getting one.\u00a0\u00a0It would be a great tool for you to use.I hope that some of this information helps you in some way.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck to you.",

            "answer": "Hi again, Brookies,I found a fabulous resource that may be helpful for you:http://www.hypoglycemia.org/This organization is focusedon hypoglycemia and much like we do here, there are support areas.\u00a0\u00a0It might be helpful for you to share experiences with other folks managing hypoglycemia because, while there are similarities to managing diabetes, I have a feeling that there is considerable difference in important details.At the very top of their webpage is a banner that includes \"Tired of being Tired?\"\u00a0\u00a0I hope you find the help you're searching for and that you'll check in here again to let us know how you're doing.",

    "question": "I am a 29 yr.old woman with hypoglycemia.I eat like the dietician told me. I eat often and include protein and avoid sugar. I am healthy otherwise. I have had bloodwork for everything under the sun. I feel like I have low energy all the time. I used to dance constantly in my earlier 20's and lately when I dance I get tired more quickly. I feel like I have to keep eating to feel energetic. I don't exercise a lot,maybe that is why I feel tired. BUT is it typical for hypoglycemics to feel generally tired and after exercising for a short time? AND are we supposed to not push ourselves when exercising? I have been slim and in decent shape my whole life. I know you have no definite answers but please answer my main question.Thank you very much.",
