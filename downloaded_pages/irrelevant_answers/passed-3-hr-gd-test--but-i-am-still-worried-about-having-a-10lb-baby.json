            "answer": "I have had 5 babies. I always failed my 1 hour test and always passed my 3 hour test until my last preg. All of my babies have been between 9-10 lbs until my last one. I didn't have GD with my big babies. With this last one I failed the 3 hour finally. I watched what I ate closely and my baby was 8lb 3oz which is really small for me.I think cutting down on portions and snacking on nuts instead of sweets is what made the difference for me. I only gained 15 lbs compared to 25-35lbs with my others.My 8 lb baby hurt just as bad as my 10 lb baby coming out so it really didn't make that much difference.",

    "question": "So my Dr. had me take the 3 hour GD test because I failed the 1 hour test. Their cut off is 140 and my number came in at 143.His concern was the size of my first, he was 9lb 3oz. My Dr. wanted to confirm as the whether I had GD or not, to possibly keep the size of the baby down if possible. Well since I passed, all he can really do is monitor the size of the baby. Has anyone else ever been in this situation and if so, what was the outcome? Were you induced early if the baby looked to be getting pretty big or did you just have to wait it out?",
