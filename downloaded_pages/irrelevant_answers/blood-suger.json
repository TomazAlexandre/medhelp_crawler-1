            "answer": "Hi,For everyone without diabetes, regardless of what you drank or ate, your blood sugars should stay within a normal limit. The idea that sugary foods and drinks will raise your blood sugars above normal(in people without diabetes or other glucose abnormalities) is false, so it should not matter what your daughter ate or drank before you\u00a0\u00a0tested.The only thing to know is: was it fasting or sometime after eating or drinking something.The value that you got would not be considered diabetic IF after eating or drinking. If it was fasting, then there should be some follow up testing done. Given your daughter's recent symptoms of thirst, I think you should schedule an appointment with her doctor to have a thorough exam and possibly some lab tests done soon.In the meantime make sure she keeps up on her fluids(water is generally best)Take care.",
