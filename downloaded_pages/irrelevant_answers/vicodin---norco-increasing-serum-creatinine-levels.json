            "answer": "It is not normal for the creatinine to rise while taking Norco or Vicodin.\u00a0\u00a0I would calculate your GFR - with examines kidney function and takes into account your weight.\u00a0\u00a0In your case, a creatinine of 1.7 translates to a GFR in the 60's.\u00a0\u00a0This suggests that the medication may be affecting kidney function.Ultrasound of the kidneys as well as microscopic examination of the urine should be considered.If the creatinine rises when you take the Norco, I would suggest finding another medication which may have less effect on the kidneys.This options should be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.
