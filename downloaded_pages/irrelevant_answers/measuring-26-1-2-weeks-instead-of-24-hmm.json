            "answer": "Hey! I have had this issue every time that I have been pregnant. Mine is due to my babies just growing fast from the time I hit about 18 weeks or so. I have also had problems with my ovulation (especially this time around) and no one really knows when I am due. Both of my boys were born early and at large weights. If your doctor is worried about your blood pressure it could be the onset of gestational diabetes or preeclampsia that could be causing the weight gain but the only way to know for sure is to be tested by your doctor. Lots of babies grow at different rates at this point and you could just have a thriving little one in there =)",

            "answer": "They go by your original due date since after week 13 babies develop at their own rate. My last pregnancy I would measure a week or two ahead and then a week or 2 behind and so on. Could just be that you are going to have a big baby, the baby went through a growth spurt or it could be like nickie said from gestational diabetes/preeclampsia.",

            "answer": "Measuring from the outside with a measuring tape is a pretty inexact thing to do.\u00a0\u00a0Do you have a tattoo on your pubic bone for each person doing the measurement to start at, so every time the tape is in precisely the same spot?\u00a0\u00a0Is there a corresponding exact mark above the uterus showing where the tape should stop?\u00a0\u00a0Have corrections been made for any body fat you have put on, in your tummy area?\u00a0\u00a0Really, for him to say something about twins after you have had an ultrasound showing one is just silly.\u00a0\u00a0Watch the blood pressure, that's an issue.\u00a0\u00a0Ignore goofy statements based on tape measurements of the outside of your body.",

    "question": "So I had my monthly checkup this morning and the doctor was measuring from my pubic bone to the top of my uterus. He said that my uterus was measuring about 26 1/2 weeks. I should be 24 weeks tomorrow according to my lmp. He asked me if I was sure I wasn't having twins, And I kind of just laughed about it. He said no seriously, Did they see just one baby on the ultrasound? And I said well yes, Thats as much as I know. He also said hes kind of nervous about my blood pressure. Each time I go to the doctors office It seems to be higher. Today my pulse was around 112, and 135/85 ish. He said that hes not too concerned about my stomach growing the way it is, But just keep your eye on it... I asked him what It could be and he didn't seem to have an answer for me.. I'm just curious if this happened or anything similiar to someone or what could be going on? I also had my ultrasound on april 30th, they said the baby looked good. But I know I had ALOT of stress from May 1st - May 15th ish from moving and family problems... He said that on my ultrasound the baby was measuring 20 weeks, 6 days... and said that would put me a few days ahead.. But yet my due date is more accurate.. Im not really sure about what to think about this appointment, Please help with any input",
