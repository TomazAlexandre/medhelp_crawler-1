            "answer": "I think you may be referring to an entity called Transformed migraine also known as chronic migraine.\u00a0\u00a0This occurs in people with prior history of migraines (don't necessarily have to have a history)that over time become more frequent and symptomatically severe.\u00a0\u00a0The migraine thus transforms from the typical episodic headache that occurs occasionally to a daily or near-daily headache. This can definitely come about and worsen into a viscious cycle due to medication overuse as your doctor had suggested.Glad that her MRI does not show anything serious.\u00a0\u00a0Mini-strokes that show up on an MRI but are clinically silent occur due to longstanding high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and other stroke risk factors.\u00a0\u00a0They do not have anything to do with her headaches.\u00a0\u00a0Your mom is on the right track if she can stop taking those meds. High blood pressure in itself can cause headaches, so make sure that is well controlled, too. GOod luck.",

            "answer": "a type of atypical migraine called hemiplegic migraines can cause stroke like symptoms and can be confused as TIAs at times. its known to be hereditary but i have them and no one else in my family has them. please look into these as they cause all they symptoms of a stroke or just a few of them, with or w/o the headache and other migraines symptoms. but you do have to watch out and not take triptans and some other type of meds with these types of migraines or they might actually cause a stroke and you are supceptable to have a stroke or TIA with these migraines, but please, ask your husbands dr about these and look more into them.",

            "answer": "Hello. I've been suffering from severe migraine headaches for 9 yrs, they have continued to get worse. I've taken feverfew,vitamins, doctor prescribed drugs and the whole works, nothing seems to get rid of them or subside them.I've had an MRI and its shown that I've had 4 mini-strokes. I've noticed with migraines plus the strokes that I've suffered memory loss, speech problems, loss of vision, numbness to my limbs, everyday motor skills lost, etc.I guess what I'm wondering is if there really is anything out there that can cure or at least subside migrains for more than a week?Are mini-strokes caused by migrains? Or is it a whole other health problem??",
