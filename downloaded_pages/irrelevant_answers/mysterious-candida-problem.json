I don't know their status.\u00a0\u00a0It was 3 years ago so my memories of the incident are hazy but as far as I can remember I was very scared of being in contact with their bodily fluids. I don't remember being in contact with any semen.",

    "question": "For the past couple of weeks or so I've been suffering from painful vaginal thrush. I've also noticed that my tongue has turned white but this is painless. It's mostly bad in the morning and it's effected my sense of taste. My doctor is on the fence about whether it's actually thrush but I'm pretty sure it is. I've suffered from these conditions before and it was very hard to treat but was eventually cleared with a course of Fluconazole and some pessaries. I had been on a course of antibiotics for a UTI previous to the first outbreak. This time, it makes no sense. I was taking Raspberry Ketone and Chromium supplements for weight loss and I guessed this could be the result of a side effect?I've always used condoms although I'm terrified one encounter was with a high risk individual. I had blood tests for diabetes and anemia a couple of years ago and I was clear. I also suffer from terrible anxiety and depression. I need some advice and a second opinion. My doctor thinks I'm overreacting.",
