            "answer": "Hello,The symptoms you've described strongly suggest an inguinal hernia on the left side. Inguinal hernias develop as the result of a weakness, tear, gap or opening in the muscle wall of the lower abdomen or groin at a region called the inguinal canal. As a result of this opening in the muscle, the contents of the abdomen, such as intestine, may protrude through the muscle creating localized pain,pressure and/or a bulge.Discomfort may not only be present in the inguinal area, but may also radiate into the hip region, back, leg or even down towards the genitalia region as referred pain.I feel that an examination by a general surgeon will be the best.Hope it helps.Take care and pls do keep us posted on how you are doing.",

    "question": "Hello. It is currently 2:18am and I cannot sleep due to a slight pressure I am feeling in my left inguinal area. It feels like there is some sort of pressure being applied on my bladder but no matter how much I use the bathroom it does not go away. 5 days ago, leading up to this night, I have had a few other weird symptoms such as very frequent Vertigo and Stomach pain in the morning. This pressure I am feeling just hit me. And it has gotten me a little bit nervous. I am sexually active however I have shared the same partner for 2.5 years and she just got tested and came up negative so I rule out STD's. I have had a weird sense that I might have type 2 diabetes but am wondering if any of these symptoms could be linked to it. Other than that I have no pass history. I have a very healthy immune system and never get sick. I am a male 21 years of age so a male uti seems a little bit rare. Please any information you might be able to provide ill be much appreciated. I feel that regardless I will definitely see a doctor about this. Thank you.",
