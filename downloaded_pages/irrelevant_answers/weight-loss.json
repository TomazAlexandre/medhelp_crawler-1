            "answer": "It is not generally healthy to lose weight during pregnancy, doctors tend to say if you are already carrying a little extra weight to just not gain as much during the course of the pregnancy, they probably ordered the u/s just to make sure baby is still healthy and gaining.",

            "answer": "I would think surely it is more important that baby is growing well...we dont weigh in lbs here but thats a healthy weight for you to be isnt it? Our midwives do not weigh us at all after our initial appt, no relevance is put on mums weight. My friend had gestational diabetes and lost over a stone (14/15lbs I think) due to the new diet she was on! As long as you are eating healthily and baby is growing, I dont see why this should be of much concern unless you are already classed as under weight.",

            "answer": "Like you when I started out with my pregnancy I was a bit heavy set, weighing in around 199. At least I was about a month before I found out I was preg. It was about 2 months before my doctor finally saw me and at that point I dropped down to 175. Due to how big I was my doctor has not been concerned with the weight loss as my body is working harder, and the baby is still completely healthy despite it all. I'm in my 7th month now, and I still have not made it back up to 199 as my gain has been very slow. It's not a bad thing so long as we know baby is ok and you were not underweight to begin with!",

    "question": "Hello I am 4months pregnant with my third child. When I found out I was pregnant I weighed 195. Then two months later I weighed 202. Now that I am four months pregnant I have lost some weight. Is weight loss ok at four months? I am wondering because my doctor questioned my weight and ordered another sonogram?",
