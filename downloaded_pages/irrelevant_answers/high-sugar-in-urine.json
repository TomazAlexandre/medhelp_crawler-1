            "answer": "I would be worried that it could be gestational diabetes with sugar in your urine. Have you had your 1 hr GTT? Glucose test? Gestational diabetes doesn't happen with every pregnancy and usually goes away after pregnancy but if you do have it you will need to change your diet.Best of luck to you and your baby!Ginger",

            "answer": "You could have or are in early stages of gestational bdiabetes. I had it with my first pregnancy and have had my glucose tolerance test today for this pregnancy..if you test positive you will have to stick to a strict diet..manage your weight. Test your blood a few times a day..you will see a dietician or diabetic team..you have to write each blood sugar result down and the diabetic team look over it every few weeks. If you cant control it via diet..you'll.be offered metformin or.maybe insulin. If you're gestational diabetic you need to eat the diet they give you its very important so baby doesn't get too big.\u00a0\u00a0I was very careful and my baby ended up only 6lb 6 and a half and I had avaginal delivery. They will give you more scans to.monitor your babys size to make.sure baby isnt getting too big. If you end up being diagnosed and want someone to talk to.feel free to message me. You might not even have it. Just be careful to eat no sugary foods or white carbs really. Good luck..hope this helped xx",
