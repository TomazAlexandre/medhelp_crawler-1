I mentioned it to my PCP several tests were done all came out negative. During summer time I feel fine. From Nov to May my body itches like crazy, mostly my upper body; head, neck, arms, chest and back. It seems to be worst with the heat or anxiety or stress. I like to workout but I can't my body is generated so much heat to the point my only solution is to stay out in the cold for few minutes. Please anyone helps, I would not socialize because of my condition.",
