            "answer": "The fruity urine smell is caused by the presence of ketone bodies (that is the most likely etiology). When insulin is used up the body goes to an alternative method of lowering glucose levels - that produces the ketone bodies. Excessive urination generally goes with the syndrome. Yes - you have the a presentation that is typical of diabetes - and this can be confirmed through a test called an hba1c and a fasting glucose or an insulin clamp protocol. Often dermatological problems develop with \"the package\" and will diminish or disappear once you get your glucose levels under control\u00a0\u00a0You also have to resolve to try to lose weight and exercise. I know this is hard.\u00a0\u00a0Needless to say you require an appointment wih an endochronologist and a visit to a diabetic clinic where a professional (usually an R.N., but not necessarily) will read you the riot act and arrange for you to see a nutritionist or review what are acceptable meals.\u00a0\u00a0Diabetes is a disease of the endochine system. Insulin is a hormone - a polypeptide. Endochronologists are the experts in this area, and I advise you so have at least one consult with such a person. You will be provided with a glucose meter and for a while have to take small blood samples until everything is under control. You will in all probability be provided with a prescription for an oral medication at first - most likely Metforman - and then a decision will be made whether or not to use additional oral meds or put you on insulin, generally Lantus for starters (a slow-acting 24 hour insulin). It is essential you get your blood sugars down to normal levels because the complications include blindness, kidney failure, and amputation of the extremeities. If you follow your physician's instructions the deisease may go into remission, but diabetes is usually a life-time problem. Medhelp has a diabetic section and Waverider and several others there have extensive experience in this area and will be happy to send you a private message if you contact them. Make an appointment with a physician to get a full evaluation of your status a top priority!",
