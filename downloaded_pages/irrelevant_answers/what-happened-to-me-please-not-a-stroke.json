            "answer": "Hi,How are you? According to the American Heart Association, stroke presents with sudden numbness or paralysis of half of the body, sudden headache, sudden confusion, or slurred speech. This can be diagnosed with imaging modalities such as Ct scan or MRI.\u00a0\u00a0 A stroke occurs when blood supply to part of the brain is disrupted, causing brain cells to die. Risk factors include high blood pressure,\u00a0\u00a0high cholesterol, diabetes, and smoking. This can also be due to transient ischemic attack which also present with stroke-like symptoms but no neurological deficits and normal ct scan. If it recurs, you may need to have this evaluated further by your doctor for proper management.\u00a0\u00a0Take care and regards.",
