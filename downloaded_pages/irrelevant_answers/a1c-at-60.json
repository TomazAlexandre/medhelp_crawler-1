I think you could safely say that your change in eating and lifestyle have reversed your condition. YOur Hba1c will be so much better when you measure again in 3 months.There is something called bootstrap coffee which is brewed coffee with extra virgin coconut oil and a teaspoon of butter.\u00a0\u00a0Honestly, I haven't tried it.\u00a0\u00a0I do eat higher fat low carb, but I still have my coffee with a dash of full cream milk or cream.",
