            "answer": "Hi,How are you? Twitching and loss of control in your hand may indeed be attributed to neurological causes, such as injury or pressure to the nerve, postural, lack of blood supply, certain medications, electrolyte imbalance, and medical conditions such as diabetes or thyroid problems. If it persists, have this evaluated further by your doctor for proper diagnosis. Your medical history and complete neurological examination are important. Treatment usually depends on the underlying cause. Take care and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "You may have a compressed radial nerve. It happened to me by sleeping on my arm \"wrong\" somehow. I actually thought I had a mild stroke when I woke to my hand not working. I was sent to my Orthopedic Doc where the run some tests using electricity to manually make your fingers move.They will have you use this \"TENS\" device twice a day . And they want you to turn it up as far as you can stand it, The more electrical stimulation, the sooner You'll recover. Hope this Helps YaPeace / 57Cuznz",

    "question": "I'm a 25 year old female. I'm fit and have no major health problems. (I train in acrobatics twice a week, so do spend some time upsidedown on my hands, but there was no recollected injury) However in the last few months i have started having problems with my right shoulder and arm. It started with a slight loss of control and then developed into not being able to internally rotate the arm (putting on a jacket would be very painful) It has developed, it no longer hurts as much, hardly at all, but if i cross my right arm over to my left side i have very little control of my right hand. Then today it just started random twitching.Is it possible i have some nerve damage in the shoulder perhaps? I am a from oversees and only in America until July and dont have proper insurance, when i return to the UK i will be able to get medical tests, but if there is anyhting i can be trying in the mean time, it would be rally usefull",
