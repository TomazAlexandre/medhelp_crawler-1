            "answer": "HelloDiabetes has two types, Type I and Type II. Type two usually occurs as people get older although it is now occurring in younger people. It is usually do to a failure of the cells of the body to respond to insulin. It is frequently associated with being overweight. Diabetes can affect a number of different areas of the body including the blood vessels of the eyes, heart and legs causing blindness, heart attack and stroke and amputation.DM can also affect the blood vessels of the kidneys especially when it occurs in combination with high blood pressure. The two can lead to kidney failure. The elevated liver enzymes is probably unrelated. Does she have a history of pancreatitis or\u00a0\u00a0gall stones. ESR is a nonspecific marker of inflammation and with all of these other issues, it could mean a number of things. good luck",
