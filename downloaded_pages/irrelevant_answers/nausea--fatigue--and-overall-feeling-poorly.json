    "question": "I am a 39 year old female who is overweight with a history of Gestational Diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0I have Hashimoto's Disease and take Sinthroid to level out my thyroid function. I am also on birth control pills.\u00a0\u00a0I have a history of being anemic and having low B12.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor also urged me to test for Celiac Disease because of these low numbers.Over the past month I have had general nausea throughout the day (but more in the mornings).\u00a0\u00a0It feels like morning sickness (which it is not) and is not so bad that I can't eat.\u00a0\u00a0In fact I usually eat hoping I will then feel better. I also have been extremely fatigued.\u00a0\u00a0I am so tired that each day I usually need a small nap to keep me going.\u00a0\u00a0I thought my thyroid was off again or that my sugar was high, however recent bloodwork showed they are both fine, but that I have an elevated CBC count. Any ideas of what this could be? Is this in alignment with Celiac Disease, or something all together different?\u00a0\u00a0I feel terrible.\u00a0\u00a0I am also under alot of stress because my two year old was recently diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, so wondering if stress is affecting how I feel as well.\u00a0\u00a0Any thoughts?",
