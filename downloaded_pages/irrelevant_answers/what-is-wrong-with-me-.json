            "answer": "Examine your stools before you flush to see if there are any threadworms.\u00a0\u00a0These are white and look like thin threads.\u00a0\u00a0These are treated by getting the correct medication either through your doctor or from the pharmacy.\u00a0\u00a0You do not need a prescription to buy medication for threadworms.If you have haemorrhoids from straining to use the toilet, that too can be irritable and itchy.\u00a0\u00a0You can get ointments and suppositories to help for this.\u00a0\u00a0The doctor can also prescribe these for you.With you having itching, I presume all over, and this was soon after you had eaten a lot of sweets and sugar cookies, it would be a good idea for you to make an appointment to see your doctor and get checked out for diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0A glucose test and/or a blood test would confirm whether you have prediabetes or diabetes.Have you been scratched or have any open sore?\u00a0\u00a0If so, bacteria can entre through the broken skin and the persistent itching could be your body fighting a bacteria.The itchiness may also be an allergic reaction to something that you have ingested or touched.\u00a0\u00a0An antihistamine medication may help.As you are working at a childcare centre, you may have picked up threadworms or scabies.Keep a diary and record everything that you consume to see if you experience these symptoms again that may pinpoint to the trigger.If you are craving for sweet products, you may have a fungal problem.If the craving is a few days before your menstrual cycle this is likely to be PMS or PMT (Premenstrual Syndrome or Premenstrual Tension).Try and keep of the sugary and processed foods and stick to a healthy and well balanced diet with plenty of fresh fruit and vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0If you feel like something sweet, have a piece of fruit to see if this will help.\u00a0\u00a0Don't buy any sweets and biscuits so that you do not have any temptation.Make an appointment to see your doctor so that you can get the correct diagnosis and the right medication to treat you.Best wishes.",

            "answer": "I swear I was positive I had worms! The doctor completely got rid of than notion though. Have had 2 stool tests and they both came back positive. I got medicine from the gastrologist and took it for 2 weeks. It was supposed to get rid of any parasites. Before, the doctor gave me steroid cream for my rectum and it seemed to ease up however it still was annoying to constantly put it on. I really think I might be gluten sensitive.",

    "question": "In late 2012, I awoke with vigorous itching in my rectum. It continued since then and during the day also. Earlier that year I went to Rome, London and Greece. I also started working at a childcare center right before I got the itching. Late 2013 the symptoms got worse. I got anxiety, depression and mood swings. And no matter how much I ate, I was still starving and constantly craving sweets. I finally went to the gastrologist, positive it was parasites. He made me do the parasite stool test and it came back saying I didn't have any parasites. Although I was very persistent to the gastrologist, so he gave me two pills to get rid of the parasites. This week, the itching came back. Full force I might add. And I have gotten some excema rashes all over my arms.(This may not pertain but I had eaten a lot of sweets and just had some sugar cookies) I am having awful insomnia because I can't stop itching at night.\u00a0\u00a0I am just so tired of this. Does anyone know what it could be?",
