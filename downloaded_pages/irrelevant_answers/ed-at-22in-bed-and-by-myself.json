            "answer": "Another note: a little bit hesitant on going to a doctor. Not too worried about the embarrassment, but more of the fact that I'm not sure I will really get the answer I'm looking for. I don't want them to tell me it's psychological and that's that. I have no known medical problems but for a little while now I have had some minor fear that I have a vascular disease or diabetes..even before I found out the problem.",

    "question": "Well, I'm 22 and have a huge problem.In the last 2 years, there have been multiple instances of me going to sleep with a girl, have awesome foreplay and come penetration time, boom, can't get hard. A few of these times I was drunk, which I pinned as the reason for the impotence but I think it's something more.The last occasion was in July, I was extremely drunk and had the issue of course, was upset but just thought it was because of the alcohol. However, it was right around then when I realized that, even in my own time, I could not get a full erection, whether I was trying to masturbate or whether it was morning wood. Unfortunately I'm not sure how long that has lasted, I only really realized it in July.Now, I watch porn/masturbate about 2 times a week, which is cut down from about 4-6 from when I realized the problem. I still have a high sex drive, just no means of completing the job.Any info on what could help? Not sure I'd need medication for the libido since that seems fine ya know. I drink once a weekend, smoke about a pack a week (smoked from 18-21, quit for a year and just started again 2 months ago), haven't really been exercising much this winter, but I was a lot the whole summer (when I realized the problem). Any help would be very appreciated. Thanks",
