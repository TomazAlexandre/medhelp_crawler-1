            "answer": "That's nuts. As long as your eating healthy and frequently you shouldn't worry about the number on the scale. Be careful of gestational diabetes towards the end but everyone gains different amounts and only gaining 5 more lbs is insane! As long as your baby is growing at the right pace do not make yourself suffer from trying to diet! Eat up girl. Only being a few lbs overweight to begin with I'm amazed your doctor is even concerned at this point",

            "answer": "Baby is under weight right now. But that may be due to both me and daddy being short. I switched doctor's to get a second option, meet him tomorrow so I'm going to see what he says! I don't want to keep watching myself. I gained 6 pounds in 4 weeks and got yelled at. So I'm very on edge with it.",

            "answer": "I don't see how you can only gain 5 more lbs when your baby will probably weigh more than that. I'm \"super over weight\" and this is my 3rd baby and I was over weight when I got pregnant with all of them. I gained 46lbs with my first and yeah that's probably not good. And only 14lbs with my second. But of all 3 none of my drs have been on my case about my weight. As long as your baby is healthy I would be like look I'm not gonna starve myself so you are happy. You are gonna gain that 5lbs even if you only eat carrots for the next 5 months. I think it's rediculous!",

    "question": "I'm 16 weeks on Thursday, and I was 15 pounds over weight when I got pregnant. I lost 25 pounds in the first 8 weeks. I gained back 10... my doctor told me I can only gain 5 more pounds.. in 24 weeks, I can only gain 5 pounds?!?! That seems crazy. What is everybody's thoughts? I can only eat meat and veggies... That's what my doctor wants!",
