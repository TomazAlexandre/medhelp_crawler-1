    "question": "Hello everyone...Well, for the last 3-4 months, I've been experiencing an odd vibrating sensation in the soles of my feet and very very rarely in my hands. I will also have headaches during the day. They are never severe, just annoying enough to notice. I don't get them every day, just sometimes, and never for long periods. The vibrating sensations come and go, too, but I experience them almost everyday, usually in my feet. My BM's have changed significantly. I only go to the bathroom when I wake up in the morning. It is never easy to produce the BM, but I manage. Lately, I have not been urinating as often as I should. My urine stream is weak and I rarely need to go. Bare in mind I am drinking mass amounts of water. I had a CT scan of my brain, as well as an MRI of my brain. Both came back clean. I've had blood tests, blah blah blah. Almost everything you can imagine. CT scan of the abdomen, too, about 2 months back. All was normal. But things are not going back to normal. 2 doctors blame it on \"anxiety and stress\". I feared it was MS, but it is not progressing, I haven't experienced any pins-and-needles or numbness, nor have I had any fatigue or muscle weakness. Does anyone know what I may be going through? Any feedback, answers and advice would be greatly appreciated.Thanks,Michael (Loofa)",
