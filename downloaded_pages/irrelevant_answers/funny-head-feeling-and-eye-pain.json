    "question": "I frequently have these strange symptoms, but all previous tests have been ok and doctors always say they are strange symptoms with nothing they can do. I get this funny head feeling, very hard to describe it properly but its sort of like a sickly pressure feeling on the top of my head, sometimes it comes more of a whoosh but mainly there constantly for a few weeks, then goes, then returns again. I hate it as if I were to write I wouldnt concentrate properly. To look at something for ages I have to screw my eyes up...I can see fine but it makes my head feel better to concentrate. It makes me feel like a zombie as I hate the feeling of it, its just not normal!!!!what is ging on????At times I get a horrible thing where I get really hot, heart beets, feel sickly and a bit funny then have to eat an apple, choc bar or lots of water and feel very hungry and shakey....what is this!!!! Last but not least, I get a horrible pain in my right eye, its more when I move it feels like a bruise or a pulled muscle, it will last a few days then return weeks, or months later, any suggestions???? When it happens there is sometimes a very dull ache in the same eye too, but the main pain is when I move my eye. Thanks if you can shed some light.",
