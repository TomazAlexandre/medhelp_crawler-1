            "answer": "Wow, being a nurse seeing these procedures and you still want to get one... Have you considered doing the hcg diet protocol? It is not invasive like surgery, fewer side effects, and probably lots cheaper. All of the health problems you mentioned could be\u00a0\u00a0helped by this diet. I urge you to do some research on this. Yes, my husband is a naturopath who prescribes this diet, but obviously you could do it with someone in your local area. He has had people come through his clinic that have had a weight loss surgery and still feel nothing works for them - then try the hcg diet and start to see results. Why not try this first and save being opened up? If you google \"Pounds and Inches\" by Dr ATW Simeons (the book is currently out of print but is available all over the internet for free) you can find out from the source what the diet is all about.",

            "answer": "I had the Lap Band procedure performed exactly 11 months ago today and I have lost 159 pounds (from 323 to 165) with 19 pounds to go.\u00a0\u00a0So, you want honesty, and here you go:\u00a0\u00a0I do not, for one minute, regret having this procedure performed, but you need to address something before you have it done...I had to face it, and it was difficult.\u00a0\u00a0I am a food addict.\u00a0\u00a0I love food - all kinds, from the most expensive 7 course meal to a low down, dirty gut bomb hamburger.\u00a0\u00a0If you are unable or unwilling to stop eating 85% of the foods that you love, don't do it. (Don't do EITHER procedure if you are unwilling to give up all of those wonderful high calorie foods) Yes, there are many things you will never be able to eat again with the band (bread, pasta, rice, crackers, peanut butter and other sticky foods) and things that you CAN eat, but hurt going down and you will end up vomiting them up, especially if you overeat.\u00a0\u00a0It is a complete lifestyle change, and if you are like I am, even now, I WANT all of those delicious things.\u00a0\u00a0I don't go out to eat with my friends anymore because it is torture to watch them eat with such abandon.\u00a0\u00a0Yes, I know they are slowly killing themselves with food, I was too, but it doesn't make you want it any less...I think I want it MORE now, since it has been so long since I had anything just decadant and delicious.\u00a0\u00a0I am slowly starting to view food as fuel, and since I get full so quickly, what I eat is becoming less of an issue.\u00a0\u00a0I get just as full from 1/2 cup of beef vegetable soup as I did from a triple chesseburger, fries, coke and dessert.\u00a0\u00a0The tatstebubs want it, but puking it up is a great deterant.\u00a0\u00a0On the brighter side, I no longer have diabetes, high blood pressure, my cholesterol went from 286 to 140 in the first three months after the band was implanted, I'm down from a size 30 to a size 8 (aiming for a 6) and I feel better than I have in years.\u00a0\u00a0I had myself convinced that \"I do everything I want to do and my weight doesn't hold me back\", but it DID.\u00a0\u00a0Not only was I carrying the equivilant of three 50 pound bags of dog food around on my butt and my gut, but the emotional strain - you may not even realize all of it until you reach a normal size - is appalling.\u00a0\u00a0I have so much more energy, self-confidence, and my outlook on EVERYTHING has changed.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0I will say that one of the girls I work with had bypass and she was off work for 6 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I was back in 3 days.\u00a0\u00a0She lost weight a LOT faster than I did (8-10 pounds a week to my 2-5), but a year in she has already started gaining a bit back.\u00a0\u00a0From what I understand, with bypass they have to make it tight enough that you will lose weight, but loose enough that when you get to your goal that you can eat - and eat she is - stretching it out - which will require another surgery to tighten it back.\u00a0\u00a0The Lap Band is fully adjustable - I went on vacation with my boyfriend and I had the option of having all the saline removed so\u00a0\u00a0could eat anything I wanted while we were in Italy.\u00a0\u00a0I chose not to do it, but the option is there. I sincerely hope that you get more feedback to help you with your decision and that things work out as well for you as they did for me, regardless of which procedure you choose.\u00a0\u00a0Feel free to message me if you have any other questions.\u00a0\u00a0:-)",

    "question": "I am a RN and have started the process for surgery.\u00a0\u00a0I've seen BOTH procedures done in person.\u00a0\u00a0I really wanted the lap band even though it is a more difficult procedure to have done.\u00a0\u00a0After a lot of researching on both I felt that I just didn't want something as drastic as the bypass that would rearrange and cut part of my intestines out of my body and be subjected to to a lifetime of replacing all the things that I would need to take for the rest of my life. Vit. sups etc.\u00a0\u00a0I've had two friends who have had the bypass done with good results.\u00a0\u00a0One had complications, readmission to the hospital twice for bleeding and ulcers soon after her surgery, the second friend has lost over 70 lbs. in 12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0She feels great, says she does not feel hungry and has tons of energy.\u00a0\u00a0After just reading some of the posts on this site I am hearing way more life stories of problems with the lap band.\u00a0\u00a0As a nurse I've heard them as well and the doctors I've been to have not recommended them for me.\u00a0\u00a0It requires many more appts. post op and much closer watching with problems coming many years later.I'd like to hear from people that have had both procedures RECENTLY like in the last two years.\u00a0\u00a0So much has changed in the last couple of years from people that had these procedures done even 3 or 4 yrs. ago.\u00a0\u00a0 I mostly want to know have you really had to stay on the very strict diet of almost all just protein and all the NO you can't have this or this or that NEVER AGAIN in your life.I will add that I weigh 252 lbs. My BMI is 39. I have Diabetes type 2, (oral meds) I am on two types of blood pressure meds, high cholesterol meds, I have chronic lower back pain from being a nurse for 29 yrs.\u00a0\u00a0I am 52 yrs. old.\u00a0\u00a0My doctor has told me that they would expect I would be off all BP, diabetes would be gone, and I would probably not need cholesterol meds. either.\u00a0\u00a0I need to lose about 100 lbs.\u00a0\u00a0I am almost positive my back pain would be gone or at least much better after losing weight.\u00a0\u00a0Who's back wouldn't feel better if they weren't carrying 9 bowling balls of fat around with them on a daily basis?Any advice from anyone on either procedure recently I'd love to hear from you.\u00a0\u00a0Both good and bad results.Thanks so much,CAgal39",
