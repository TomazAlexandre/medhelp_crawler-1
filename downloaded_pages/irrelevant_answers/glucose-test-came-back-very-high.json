            "answer": "a lot of women fail thenone hoir test. The three hour test numbers are a larger scale.\u00a0\u00a0If you fail the three hour it means gestational diabetes which mean yiur obgyn may put younon a special diabetic pregnancy diet and sometimes combined with meds or insulin depending on how high the numbers are.\u00a0\u00a0Dont worry as with care from your OB it.can be kept under control. Also, just because you failed the 1 hour dont mean you jBe gestational diabetes.\u00a0\u00a0Lastly, if you end up being diagnosed this usually fades after the baby is born.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck! :)",

Also the room service has the information they won't let me order what I want. I get very hungry and force my husband to go buy me food. I really hope you pass but am sure it won't be as crazy as mine since you are home good luck.",

            "answer": "If you fail you will be required to check your sugar when you wake up and after every meal. U will be put on a diet where you would have to watch your sweets and carb intake. They usually have you take a nutrition class so u know how to more or less meal prep. Usually having 6 small meals/snacks a day. Along with that they would ask that you walk after meals and may have that combined with medication. It may sound overwhelming but in the end it is worth it to have your sugar under control. Gd can lead to large babies, defects and stillborns.",
