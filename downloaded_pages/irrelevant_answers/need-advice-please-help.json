            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!Since you have temperature fluctuations the first things to be ruled out are thyroid disorders, adrenal gland problems, anemia, diabetes, hypoglycemia, liver diseases, low Vit B12, and vasovagal attacks.Try going to a walk in clinic and get this assessed. Burping can be due to gastric reflux, inflammatory bowel disease or due to electrolyte imbalance. Take Omeprazole empty stomach in morning and an antacid gel at bedtime. Refrain from smoking, alcohol, fuzzy drinks and spicy food. Walking around also helps clear gas. See if this helps.Take care!",
