            "answer": "Depending on how bad you failed it you would either a) have to take insulin or b) diet control. I had it with my last pregnancy but not my first. I diet controlled it. You can eat everything normal but you will have to watch your carbs such asBreadCerealRicePastaMilkSugarCandyDessertsJuiceSugary drinksFried foodsPotatoesToo much fruitChipsI ate pretty normally just less of those thing there was few things i couldnt eat like cereal was a heck no but the rest was okay in small portions and they will have you test your blood sugar 4 times a day 1-2 hours after you eat and once in the morning. Youll be okay as long as you keep it under control. Dont assume you have to only eat soup and salads. Ive seen a lot of women do that. And as for the babies size idk you can check your week by week thing on this app to see what size your baby should be.Youll be fine mama just remember if your blood sugar is consistently too high your baby can over grow my son was only 6.13lbs but i kept my sugar under control. And if you keep eating unhealthy then when the baby is born once the cord is cut the babies sugar level could drop drastically and have to be put on a sugar water drip. So just try heathier low card foods. And remember veggies and fruits have carbs. Look up nutrition facts on foods youre eating and during 1 sitting try to stay around 30 grams of carbs",

            "answer": "You have to go through the 4 hour test so they can determine if you have it or not. If you fail the 4 hour one you have gestational diabetes. It's hard for them to determine how big the baby is. I had it with my daughter and they said she measured big but she ended up being 6 lbs when she was born. If you have it they will have you measure blood sugar levels up to 3 times a day. They will train you how to do that and how to administer the shots if your levels are high. I had to have insulin injections and I did everything on my own. They had me inject myself in my belly so it was painless. Your blood sugar levels will be monitored at each appointment and after delivery. Everything is supposed to go back to normal after delivery. They considered me high risk pregnancy because of that. I could pick my delivery date and get induced prior to my due date. They might put you on a diet you are supposed to monitor your carbs. Hope that helps.",

            "answer": "And your baby should be around 2.5 lbs but i wouldnt trust what they say. Seriously they can be 1-2 lbs off. Its like looking at a photo of someone and guessing their weight. You still have your 4 hour test",
