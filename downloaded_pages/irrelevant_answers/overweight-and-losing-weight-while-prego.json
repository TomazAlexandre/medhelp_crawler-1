            "answer": "I was overweight when I fell pregnant with my last baby. It was alcohol that made me overweight so when I was pregnant and wasn't drinking I ended up being 2lb lighter when I had my baby than when I fell pregnant. My doctors where not concerned at all and. I had a 7lb 11 baby boy at 39 week's. I had so much energy and felt great throughout the whole pregnancy. I am now 31 weeks pregnant again and haven't gained a pound so far either. I'd say I will now I'm at the end but I'm not worried either way :-)",

    "question": "Hi I'm wondering if anyone is overweight/obese and changed their eating habits since pregnancy to clean eating or healthier foods and has managed to lose weight. I am 7 wks prego and have decided to change my eating habits completey. Since I am overweight I thinking I will lose weight not because I will eat less just because the type of foods will be a lot mire healthier and I will be making sure I get all necessary nutrients my baby needs and no empty calories from junk food. Anyone dealt with this?",
