It would be a good idea to consult a rheumatologist for this.It is difficult to comment beyond this at this stage.\u00a0\u00a0Please let me know if there is any thing else and do keep me posted. Take care!",

    "question": "I have been diagnosed with low range of motion in all my joints like 2 years ago and now they hurt really bad all the time and below my elbows and knees i get a tingly feeling a couple times a day.\u00a0\u00a0I find myself taking a lot of ibuprofen and/or naproxen.\u00a0\u00a0Also my face starts to hurt suddenly sometimes only on the right side and it's my cheek forehead and eyes but i don't have a tooth or ear infection.\u00a0\u00a0Another thing is I have bad anxiety and shake from it sometimes.\u00a0\u00a0Also I have suddenly swelled up i was a size 3 and now i'm a size 9. i'm only 19yrs old and i can't figure out why.\u00a0\u00a0I am going to the doctors tomorrow but i hate when they say that i'm over exagerrating on how much my joints and face hurt. I always get told that i just have to strengthen my joints so they don't hurt but i've been doing physical therapy for a long time and it's only gotten worse. Does anyone know what this could be? or have symptoms like this?",
