    "question": "So just had my last ultrasound to see the size of the baby and he measured at 9.6 pounds but she told me to take a pound off so he is pretty much 8.6! Anyone else have a big baby at 37 weeks and 4 days?? Am I going to be able to give birth naturally?? And I tested negative for gestational diabetes at 28 weeks so is it normal to still have this big of a baby? Sorry so many questions I'm a ftm and worry wart!",
