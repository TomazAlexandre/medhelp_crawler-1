    "question": "Hi, I thought I would come to this site to ask for help. I have been sick since mid March 08, and the doctors and specialists I have seen, so far, dont know why. I was rushed to the E.R mid March with diarrohea and bleeding from the bowel, and was diagnosed with Crohns colitis. I have been on Prednisone 40mg, 30mg, 20mg, 10mg and now 10mg every second day, as well as I take 500mg of Sulfasalazine two tabs three times a day since then. Since mid March I have been having \"episodes\" up-to three times a week always in the mornings. (usually after I have eaten or had water to drink, but not always).I start by feeling cold, get nasea, then my body shakes all over (pretty badly). I have to go to the bathroom and use my bowels, and urinate about 3-4 times. Sometimes I get headaches also. The \"episode\" lasts for about an hour and a half. Then I start to return to normal, although I am very tired, and fall asleep. I also have flank pain and tightness mostly on the left side, but it can be on the right flank also, sometimes pain under my left rib where the colon is, but I can feel it on the right side occassionally. My blood pressure is high, and I have never had that in my life. I am always \"shaky\" ever since this started in March. My white blood count is and has been around 12, which my specialist says can indicate inflamation?Heres what tests I have had so far.....I am under the care of a GI specialist and have had an endoscopy, two colonoscopys, stomach X-rays, two CT scans, a capsule endoscopy last week which showed no colitis, blood tests every two weeks, urine tests and cultures, stool cultures and an abdominal ultrasound I have been tested for diabetes and dont have that. All tests come back normal. I have seen an Allergist, a Urologist , Cardiologist, Neurologist, Endocronologist and several doctors. No one can find anything wrong with me. I tried a lactose free and gluten free diet for two months and it made no difference. I dont drink, smoke, drink tea or coffee, and eat well and drink at least two litres of water a day . I have lost 10 kilos this year through being sick. I am 40 years old and have never been sick in my life, or had any surgeries. I dont know what to do next, but if there is anything anyone can suggest to help, I am willing to try it to get my life back to normal.",
