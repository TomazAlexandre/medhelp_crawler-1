            "answer": "HiWelcome to the MedHelp forum!With hot flashes or temperature spikes as you put it and lightheadedness with a feeling of passing out, you could be having either polycystic ovarian disease (if you are a female, on net one cannot be sure) or GERD with or without H pylori infection. These are the two conditions to be ruled out first. Other conditions to be strongly ruled out in your case (since you have other symptoms such as ringing in the ear) could be cervical spinal nerve compression, Meniere\u2019s disease of the ear, wax in the ear, infection of the middle or inner ear, and benign intracranial hypertension. Hence it is important to consult an ENT specialist and a neurologist too. At times back and neck problems may persist for years before they really start giving trouble. Chances of TMJ too should be looked into. Other causes are anemia, hypoglycemia or low sugar and some endocrine problems, such as an underactive thyroid (called hypothyroidism), overactive thyroid (called hyperthyroidism), adrenal insufficiency (called Addison's disease), low blood sugar levels, and in some cases, diabetes, may lead to hypotension and hence lightheadedness and an off balance feeling. It is really difficult to comment on the net. I suggest you consult your PCP to run the basic investigations and get an insight into what could be the cause. Depending on clinical examination and tests, your PCP can refer you to the appropriate specialist. Hope this helps. Please feel free to ask anything else you may want to know. Take care!",

            "answer": "(i am a female)\u00a0\u00a0')i hope that this is nothing too serious as an ovarian disease... i just want it to be a simple thing lol.i have had really bad back and neck problems now that you mention it. i have pretty bad scoliosis and it messes with me daily. not sure if that has any link to it. my guess is that i have Menorrhagia and i become anemic. but you never know with these things especially when its been ongoing for quite some time. i've done alot of research on my part. so i hope that i have good results.",

    "question": "ever since 3 years ago i started to have this odd and frightening episode happen to me every so often. i start to feel very oddly. my body temp spikes up very rapidly. my ears will start to ring very loudly, and then i get this sensation that i am bleeding out of my ears. from there my vision tends to get all blotchy- everything goes black and i can see very little. from there i lose my balance quickly and usually lose muscle function and fall on the floor. and normally when everything starts to go back to normal i appear to feel shaky and am weary about moving around at all.my theories:-low blood pressure-something to do with my menstral cycleanyone have any idea of what might be going on with me? i'm starting to get concerned...",
