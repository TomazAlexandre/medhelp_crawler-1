            "answer": "I didn't get your age, but I'll assume you are in your 50s or 60s. There are a number of causes of ruptured vessels and as far as I know apirin isn't a cause of this condition. The most common would be diabetes and high blood pressure. With high blood pressure and high cholesterol, using a statin and aspirin are probably good for you. I wouldn't stop the aspirin for now. Heavy lifting is usually not associated with ruptured blood vessels on the retina though Purtcher's Retinopathy would be an extreme example of this scenario. Best wishes,Timothy D. McGarity, M.D.",

            "answer": "I probably should have mentioned that I have been on statins for 15 years but only started liprinosil and baby aspirin two and a half years ago after I had a possible TIA (my symptom was 15 minutes of confused thinking).\u00a0\u00a0However, all tests (EEG, Carotid artery test) were normal and I think my 15 minutes of confusion was in the end due to dehydration, not a TIA.\u00a0\u00a0My point is that the first ruptured eye vessel happened after I started taking the baby aspirin.",

    "question": "Hello Doctors, and thanks for your advice.\u00a0\u00a0During my annual eye exam with my opthamologist last week he discovered a small blood vessel rupture inside my eye during the dilation exam.\u00a0\u00a0A similar rupture was discovered last year in the same eye, and that had been found to resolve at a follow-up exam.\u00a0\u00a0He told me that this points to some possible underlying problem and wants me to follow-up with my regular doctor for tests and return to him in 7 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0I am on a stain for high cholesterol, and take 5mg of liprinosil for HBP and a baby aspirin a day.\u00a0\u00a0I now recall that previous to both exams I had been doing heavy lifting of rocks one time and moving from one house to another the first time and moving heavy items.\u00a0\u00a0My question is whether or not ruptured blood vessels are a common occurrence and what might be causing them.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have a follow-up scheduled with my regular doctor until August (he is away) and am wondering if I should schedule with another doctor, or if it is okay to wait.\u00a0\u00a0I also thought maybe I should start taking the baby aspirin every other day rather than every day because I read that aspirin might make one prone to this problem.\u00a0\u00a0My vision has never been impacted, by the way. Thank you.",
