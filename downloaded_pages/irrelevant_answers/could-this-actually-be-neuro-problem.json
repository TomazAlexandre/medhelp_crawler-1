            "answer": "Hi Duchess,You say you have Graves & your thyroid lab is normal. Have they tested your TSI antibodies (thyroid stimulating immuniglobblins) lately. You can have normal labs with high antibodies. You can also be erythroid (have normal thyroid labs) & have active Graves Eye Disease.I am also a Graves pt. with Graves eye disease. My thyroid labs are normal but my antibodies are still in the active range.It would probably benefit you to see an opthalmologist. (Eye MD) for a check up & also get your TSI antibodies checked.What type of treatment did you have for your Graves during the hyperactive phase? I-131 (ablation) radiation treatment is known to cause GED. You can also get GO if you go hypo on anti-thyroid meds.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Best wishes & God Bless, Jean",

    "question": "In 1997 I had severe pain in my left eye and it was bulging.\u00a0\u00a0Doctor had CTSCAN of eye and found that there was inflammation behind eye.\u00a0\u00a0He diagnosed me with Orbital Pseudo Tumor.\u00a0\u00a0I have had several episodes since then always my left eye only.\u00a0\u00a0Last time my doc. wasn't absolutly sure it was OPT, but treated me with steroids and my eye went back to normal. Since I have had other problems over the years ranging from severe neck pain with paralysis to vertigo.\u00a0\u00a0I have trouble physically swallowing sometimes and have had trouble with muscles used for urinating (couldn't feel the urge to go).\u00a0\u00a0I have recently been diagnosed with Gastroparesis.\u00a0\u00a0I do not have diabetes and I do have Graves disease.\u00a0\u00a0Although I am in remission right now and my thyroid has been normal for 3 months so far. I have also had problems with\u00a0\u00a0my ears for years, feeling very cold, fevers of unknown origin, rapid onset of extreme pain in finger, foot, arm leg at different times, heart palps.\u00a0\u00a0As I add up all of these things I wonder if they can all actually from one disorder.",
