            "answer": "Have you changed your diet to one that may help handle the way your stomach empties? If not, check out a gastroparesis diet. It may be of some help. You can find an example at www.gicare.com and on other places on the net.Do you have any history of diabetes? Gastroparesis can be tied in with that problem. It's also know to occur in some people with gallbladder issues and if someone is refluxing bile into the stomach in some cases. So could your gastritis be due to bile reflux and not acid?Are there any GI issues that run in your family?",

    "question": "I have been suffering for seven months with stomach pain, spasming, nausea, and neck pain. Went through a variety of tests and thanks to my primary doctor, had an upper GI which showed very slow transit of food from my stomach. My gastro specialist could care less and said I had IBS - even though I showed none of the obvious symptoms. I have tried Reglan to speed up stomach contractions but could not handle the side effects. I don't know what to do besides find another specialist. Have no idea what's up with the increased neck pain when stomach problems are at their worst. I do have a herniated disk in my neck. Do you think the vagus nerve is being stimulated or damaged. They also found I have GERD, a common side effect of gastroparesis. Thank you for your help!",
