            "answer": "Good morning! I think I may have the answer to your question.I had this same problem after breakfast this morning and was weirded out. No one else in the family was having it, so I was thinking I had some kind of organ failure or something! Yikes.I kept googling, though, and found that there is a fish called escolar that causes this phenomenon. It is often sold under the wrong label (orange roughy, cod, sea bass, white tuna), so you may not know you have eaten it. This fish cannot process certain esters, so it stores large quantities and human consumers excrete them. I don't know why the rest of my family has had no problem...maybe they just don't notice their BMs. Also, I ate more of the fish than they did.I read, too, that Olestra (artificial fat found in low fat foods such as Pringles and other chips) can cause the same symptoms. Cashews can cause it in susceptible people.Hooray! No pancreatitis!!",

    "question": "Does having orange oily-like bowel movement mean that your amylase and lipase is up? I was diagnosed with Pancreatitis 2 years ago and had 2 be hospitalized for a month beacuse of my Diabetes being too high and amylase & lipase being over 1000 (it was 1500). So I was wondering if I need 2 be re-hospitalized 2 see if it's up because I'm very scared if I don't something about this soon.This discussion is related to<a href=\"http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/227639\">http://www.medhelp.org/posts/show/227639</a>.",
