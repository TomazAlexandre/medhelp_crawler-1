            "answer": "no one can MAKE you take meds, but try and understand it is in your best interest. The reason your doctors are becoming so alarmed is because that just stopping meds can have FATAL consiquences, SPECIALLY with blood thinners.(my father in law stopped taking blood thinners and the same day dropped dead in the middle of church, luckily he was revived) Please be careful, and DO NOT just stop taking your medications. Talk to your doctor about possible lifestyle changes, but it is a proccess of making those changes and weaning off the meds, not stopping cold turkey.",

    "question": "I'm a 63 year old caucasian male, obese (5'9', 250 lbs), hypertensive, type 2 diabetic, and I had a mild stroke 3 years ago. I'm on numerous meds for diabetes, hypertension, cholesterol, and blood thinners -- and I don't like all the side effects. As a result, I often quit taking some or all of my meds, and I always get severely scolded by my primary care physician and my other health care providers. I feel much better when I stop taking my meds, but when I quit my meds, my blood glucose and blood pressure go up, and I recently had a bad episode of tachycardia, which I was told was caused by my stopping Toprol XL. Help! Is there some way to approach my doctor about trying lifestyle changes instead of all these medications? I'm afraid that she is going to tell me to find another doctor soon, if I don't do what she says -- but I often feel that she and other doctors don't listen to my complaints about medical side effects. What can I do? I am willing to try a very restrictive diet, if it would let me quit all the meds.",
