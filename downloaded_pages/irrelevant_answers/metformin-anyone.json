            "answer": "Metformin is a drug used to control type 2 diabetes and gestational diabetes. So maybe I am little confused but was this supposed to assist you in becoming pregnant. I am only asking because I have taken that drug during my first pregnancy and I am continuing to take it through this one.",

            "answer": "It is a diabetes medicine but it is also used in women with Poly Cystic Ovarian Syndrome or PCOS. Many women with PCOS are insulin resistent and insulin levels contribute to their hormonal levels being out of wack. Women with PCOS have a higher risk of getting diabetes, heart disease, and cancer. Metformin helps regulate insulin levels so that the person can regulate their period and help with ovulation which is difficult in women with PCOS or even impossible for some without help with medicine. Metformin also helps a woman with PCOS have less of a risk for miscarriage (which is common with PCOS) especially if taken during the first trimester. Some woman cannot be helped with Metformin alone or it may not help at all. Clomid is often used with or without Metformin with women with PCOS.",

    "question": "Anyone here on Metformin and have a success story?I have been on Metformin for only a month and a half for my PCOS to help regulate me and help me get pregnant. Last week (about 8 days ago) I had some very very light bleeding that only showed when I wiped and it wasn't every time. It only lasted three days and then stopped but my mild cramping, bloating, back pain, gas hasn't stopped and three days ago I had a very sudden on set of a runny nose and scratchy throat that is beginning to finally subside. Am I preggo? Only time and a test will tell but I wasn't expecting it to work this fast and if it did, YAY!",
