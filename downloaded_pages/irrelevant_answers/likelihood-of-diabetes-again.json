            "answer": "They say that most likely you will get gestational diabetes again with the next pregnancy after having it before. But I would just make sure to eat healthy anyways, eat protein with your carbs and see where you go from there. They also generally test earlier when you have already had it once.",

    "question": "I am 38 and just found out I am pregnant again! My lo is almost two (also have a 13 and 11 yo). I had diabetes with the last one and am wondering if it's just inevitable that I will have it again. Before becoming pregnant I was prediabetic as my morning blood sugars we're a tad high and a fasting test showed so. I had returned to normal after birth. I have heard that it's more likely to occur again\u00a0\u00a0but also met someone who had it with first and not second. I was younger with my oldest and had no problems even with my weight. I was 175 at start and 225 at delivery. I didn't gain but 19 lbs with the last lo...diabetic diet! My performance weight is 200 so I know that plays a factor with my old age!",
