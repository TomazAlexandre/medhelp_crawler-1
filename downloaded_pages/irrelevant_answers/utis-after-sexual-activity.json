            "answer": "Hi there,Women as such are more prone for UTIs compared to men. This is because women have a shorter urinary tract compared to males. There are several risk factors which make a woman more susceptible to recurrent UTI like sexual intercourse, changing sexual partners, use of spermicidal products, having a maternal history of UTIs, waiting for too long to urinate etc .Management of recurrent UTI should aim at understanding the pathogenesis of UTI and role of host and bacterial factors. In postmenopausal women the risk factors are utero-vaginal prolapse, urinary incontinence and post void residual urine. Any factor which causes obstruction to the flow of urine like\u00a0\u00a0urolithiasis, malignancy, renal cyst, neurogenic bladder, or urethral diverticulum, an indwelling catheter, ureteric stent, or nephrostomy tube are at higher risk. Medical conditions like diabetes mellitus, renal failure, renal transplantation, and immunosuppression bypasses host defenses and facilitates entry of uropathogens.If a woman is suspected to have any anatomic or functional abnormalities then advanced urodyanamic studies may be needed. The use of prophylactic antibiotics for six to 12 months is effective in reducing the number of recurrent UTI. A low-dose or postcoital antimicrobial therapy can be effective for women with constellations of many recurrent UTIs, but should be discussed with a urologist. Do keep us posted on how you are doing.Take care and good luck!",
