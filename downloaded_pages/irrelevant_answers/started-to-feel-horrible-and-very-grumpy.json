            "answer": "I am obviously not a professional or capable of providing any reasonable explanations for your mood and physical symptoms but it sounds like things are really starting to build up and you are stressing to the max. Believe me, I understand worry but the thing is you truly do not have enough factual data to base any conclusions or make any outcome-based decisions. It is extremely likely much (if not all) of these things are manageable so try and let yourself take a break on assuming the worst.Four years ago is not all that long and it's possible your liver may still be in fairly mild condition. I am very glad your appointment to see a specialist is next week - I hope you mean liver specialist. At that point you will have the chance to find out what your genotype is and what your viral load is as well as other data that may indicate when and if you can treat your HCV.\u00a0\u00a0I believe out of range liver enzymes in and of themselves could indicate a variety of things.\u00a0\u00a0I don't know much about diabetes but it seems like constant thirst and a few of the other symptoms you mentioned need to be addressed and adjusted. Whether this is all related to your HCV, I cannot say.I hope one of the more experienced members can provide symptomatic relief as I simply do not have the expertise. You are in the right place and encourage you to read posts as well as post frequently as I am certain you will learn a lot and it will allay lots of your anxiety.\u266b",

            "answer": "Do you remember what yr ALT/AST level was last time you got tested? Mine was usually around 75/100 but gradually climbed, thru 20 yrs, always elevated (many people with Hep C have normal enzymes) but this year, I was 400/500. My other warning symptom was, I had hot flashes all the time, which came when anything irritated me, and on heat-wave days, I would quickly develope heat-stroke. Also, my pee smelled like ammonia, and the socks started hurting my ankles and leaving marks. It was almost like I felt uncomfortable in my own skin~ I would get another biopsy, I had had an ultra-sound, which read my liver was normal, but when I finally got thenerve to get the biopsy, my liver had stage 2 fibrosis, so I choseto seek treatment, because my blood work didn't look good at all, I had low plateletes, all of the sudden, they had always been normal before, and that is a bad sign, that the liver is going toward cirrhosis, so I am on week 7 and ahalf of treatment.Your biopsy very likely could tell you that your liver is fine, and the thirsty and other sides might be diabetes symptoms, or thyroid...it's like you have to be a detective, my own doctor never put my heat symptoms with Hep C, she prescribed some heart medicine, for the heat=stroke, which I never took! I feel much better now!",

            "answer": "Constant (or nearly) urination and thirst are both hallmarks of type II DM. If you\u2019re A1c results are brushing 10.0 now the doctor will likely want to get this controlled prior to initiating HCV treatment. I really can\u2019t comment intelligently on the other symptoms you mention.Hopefully you\u2019re connecting with either a GI or hepatologist next week. If you haven\u2019t had a liver biopsy for four years, they might recommend another to see if fibrosis (scarring) has progressed. They\u2019ll also probably order blood tests; CBC, compressive metabolic panel, etc. In fact, you might want to call their office today and see if they want to order labs in advance of your appointment next week; that way you could go over these with the doctor.With liver enzymes elevated like that it\u2019s likely you have some activity going on, but it\u2019s hard to draw any conclusions based on those results. The other tests mentioned above might offer more diagnostic data.Do you know what genotype, or strain of HCV you have? There have been advances in HCV management over the past few years; there are adjunctive drugs added to the original interferon/ribavirin that are make treatment more effective for select genotypes.Good luck, and let us know how the appointment goes.

            "answer": "I imagine once you get tight control of your diabetes you\u2019ll feel much better. An A1c result of 10.0 correlates to a finger-stick average of roughly 240 mg/dL; are you doing routine self testing as well? Ask your primary care doctor for a referral to a diabetes management class; they have educating RN/nutritionists that can help set up a meal and exercise plan with you.I imagine the doctor went over this with you previously, but here it is again: watch carbs, including things like potatoes, pasta, white bread, white rice as well as sweets. Try to minimally get 50 minutes of brisk walking or equivalent exercise daily, and finally be compliant with insulin/anti-diabetes oral meds. It generally takes at least two, and usually all three of three of these measures to achieve tight BG control.Check with the doctor; I heard trolls have a high glycemic index!

I am overweight six foot three , three hundred pounds, until recently . i have dropped fifteen pounds, but I have not tried it just happened in less then two weeks, jenny craig\u00a0\u00a0would be proud... i assume that is from the constant urination-water loss .I knew i should have laid off the gummy trolls but they taste so good.P.S.\u00a0\u00a0if youre still listening next week will let you know outcome of visit",

            "answer": "For some reason, people with Hep C tend to get diabetes after they catch Hep C. Do you know which condition came first?\u00a0\u00a0I caught Hep C about 23 yrs ago, at the same time as my ex-boyfriend. I had no symptoms for the first 20 yrs, but I remember, I ran into that Ex, about 17 yrs ago, and I noted he had lost ALOT of weight, but had this big, hard, belly.\u00a0\u00a0He had gone form beiing his usual weight of 160, down to 140!\u00a0\u00a0Around 12 yrs ago, he called me, to accuse me of giving him Hep C ( I told him it was the other way around, lol) and that he had found out he had Diabetes,and Hep C, and had been treated for Hep C successfully!Then, two yrs ago I ran into him at the Beach, and he was still diabetic, but Hep C free! He asked me why I was still running around with the Hep C virus, and got me to thinking. I had put off treatment, to have 2 more kids.Like I said before, about two yrs ago, I started smelling pissy, and my sweat no longer smelled and felt good, it felt sticky- and after my biopsy, foundout I DID have stage 2 fibrosis, and I'm getting treated. But diabetes also makes yr pee stink, so it's a tough call.\u00a0\u00a0Losing weight suddenly is definitely a symptom to get checked out right away, so I am glad you are seeing the gastro, getting the blood tests lined up. I kept waiting for the \"fatigue\" symptom to come around, so I put off getting treated for that reason, becuz I had energy. But it was the blood test that let me know I was in trouble, and the biopsy. Hep C symptoms are not always common, until cirrhosis sets in, and much more chance of cure, to catch it in stage 2 or 3, rather then 4. But hopefully your liver is still fine, only one out of 4 Heppers go on to have cirrhosis.",

            "answer": "How did your ex get fixed ? and also what an *** for treating you like that. i got hep c from a blood transfusion in 1983, and did not know i had it until four years ago... and i am only assuming that is when i got it , i had gotten a letter from the hosp where the transfusion took place that said i could be at risk. and it looks like i won the lottery, that is also when i was told i had diebetes(sorry about my misspelling). at the time I was very sick , tired, puking all the time, and my legs feel like they just bubble with spasms and pain. I also had bad high blood pressure,\u00a0\u00a0I lost weight and the high blood pressure went away although i was on meds for quite some time (80mg micardis), i was diagnosed with diabetic nueropothy, but dont think i was showing any signs of hep c , of course i was too ashamed to ask, then when i did tell someone he said \"isnt that like aids\".. my problem i put this off never really got informed and now that everythng seems to be going to crap I dont really know what to do or what to expect, so thank you so much for responding to me, this is the first time I have ever talked about this to someone besides a small town dr. ............I hope your treatment goes well for you , anything else anyone can tell me please let me know, i am having a harder time reading as my eyes dont work as well anymore either...but i can read this monitor...",

            "answer": "Hey, how are you this week? My Ex got his Hep C cured, all those years ago, with just the standard Interferon/Ribavirin treatment, because that is all they had, back then.I had just noticed, his Hep C and diabetes came on, at the same time, and noted the connection. His diabetes did get better after he got rid of the Hep C virus, but he said, when he eats 'Lil Debbie\" cakes (they are like Hostess twinkies, etc) then he has to take the shots again...sigh.I am assuming I caught the Hep C virus from him, the one time I tried injecting cocaine with him, which isn't even a drug I ever liked, I was just being an dare-devil, young and feeling invincible.\u00a0\u00a0I am pretty sure I caught it from him, because I had never used I.V. drugs before that, and he had. And I hadn't ever had a blood transfusion...I actually refused to be given one, after I hemmoraged, during the birth of my first son, in 1983.It's unfortunate that the blood supply wasn't made safe, until 1985.\u00a0\u00a0I'm wishing you much luck with your battle against this virus~",

            "answer": "1960-1970\u2019sScientists developed blood tests to identify hepatitis B (1963) and hepatitis A (1973), but many of the blood samples taken for post-transfusion illness tested negative for hepatitis A and hepatitis B. Given that the mode of transmission (blood transfusion) was the same, scientists classified the unidentified cases as non-A, non-B hepatitis. It is now believed thatapproximately 90-95% of cases previously classified as non-A, non-B (NA/NB) were actually hepatitis C.1980-1990\u2019sIn the 1980\u2019s, investigators from the Centers for Disease Control (headed up by Daniel W. Bradley) and Chiron (Michael Houghton) identified the virus in 1989. In 1990, blood banks began screening blood donors forhepatitis C, but it wasn\u2019t until 1992 that a blood test was perfected that effectively eliminated HCV from the blood transfusion supply. Now, there is less than one per two million transfused units of blood estimated tobe tainted with hepatitis C. Prior to the screening of the blood supply for hepatitis C, approximately 300,000 Americans contracted hepatitis C through blood transfusions or blood products.http://www.hcvadvocate.org/hepatitis/factsheets_pdf/Brief_History_HCV_10.pdf",
