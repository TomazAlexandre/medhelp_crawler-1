But we DO know what's in these shots....and sure don't crave them!LL",

            "answer": "I have heard of\u00a0\u00a0an inteferon junki. I actually know one his name is Karl like snoppys master. This guy whos in his sixties quite a funny type (bit of a hillbilly) . He said when he was doing tx, that it reminded him of the good old days when he was shooting up some speed.So when he took that shot in the stomach he even felt a little horny! He really locked forward to that moment every week.If thats not a inteferon junkii I dont know what is.The brain is a funny thing, and its capacity of suggestion never stop to baffle me! LOLAnd he had those peginteferon pens dosen\u00b4t even look like something\u00a0\u00a0suggestivable.Of course this guy cleared the virus.To be serios, theres an old saying that goes, ones an opened vena will never close again.I don\u00b4t think that is the whole truth but there is some truth in it.And we who had been doing that, open them venas, we shouldn\u00b4t get to surprised, if we get crazy thougths even after long time not using.My vena has been closed for 21years (if its possible to get them closed)Today forinstance when taking my 19th shot this sec tx I\u00b4ve got this crazy thought that not to destroy my pegasus injection thing and instead save it for a rainy day .If you are figthing for better environment, reuse is not such a bad thing, I thought!But those thoughts its like birds flying over your head, and maybe they always will fly there. And there is nothing you can do about it.But even if you can\u00b4t stop them from flying , you can hopingly prevent them from building a nest in your head.And thats exactly\u00a0\u00a0what I did.I simply destroyed there building material by clipping the needle and throwing the other stuff in a little plastic box that the hospital so kindly had\u00a0\u00a0provided me with.Take care and may the good God bless and protect you.ca",
