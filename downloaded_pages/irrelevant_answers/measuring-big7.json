            "answer": "My last baby was 8lb 12 but they induced me at 37 weeks because of his size and I had spd and my baby before that was 9lb 2 and was very long labour but she was 5 days late. I was measuring big this time too so had a scan 2 weeks ago and he is an average sized baby. It doesn't mean your baby is big but if it is they may recommend an early induction as with larger babies there is a higher risk of needing an assisted birth, so forceps or c section. A large baby could also indicate gestational diabetes. They will talk you through it if he is large and will also take into consideration your living arrangements. Even though the labour with my daughter was longer than most, it was a natural delivery, she was fine, I didn't even tear and she was overdue so it won't necessarily mean an early birth, but there is no way to predict it. Keep us updated and let us know the outcome of the scan.",

            "answer": "I Live in UK..and FTM.. had three fundal measurements so far from 26 wks.. my lil boy was measuring fine at 10percentile line.. but at 31wks he started measuring two weeks ahead at 90percentile line... My Midwife is so sweet she sent me second day for U/S because she wanted to make sure about baby's wellfare.. i went for U/S scared because i knew i dont have placenta previa and neither baby is breech because his heartbeat is always found above pubic bone so he's been head down since 26wks.. i was scared of having too much amniotic fluid.. after waiting an hr for u/s it turned out he had a growth spurt and he was indeed measuring big about 1902g weigh which is round about 4.18lb at 31 wks.. and i am so glad he is healthy... but i m told to weight till 34wks and if he went above the predicted line will be getting another U/S... so dont worry babies can have growth spurts may be he is just grown :)",
