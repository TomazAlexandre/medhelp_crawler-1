            "answer": "I gained zero weight with my daughter and I was so worried!!! My daughter reassured me that baby takes from mom. Not directly from what you consume. So baby will grow and thrive off of mama's fat storage and the only real time it's a super concern, is if the mother's pre-pregnancy weight is well below normal. So even if you were pretty thin to start, your baby will be fine unless mom's weight drops into an unhealthy weight range. Try eating Ben and Jerry's or other pack on the pounds foods a little more if you are super concerned. I'm not saying like all the time but whatever your favorite treat or not-so-good-for-you thing is, go for seconds! :) seriously though, unless you are getting into an unhealthy low weight range, baby is fine!!!",
