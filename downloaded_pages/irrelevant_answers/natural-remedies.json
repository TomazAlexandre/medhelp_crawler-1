Lose weight.\u00a0\u00a0Yes. Very hard. But it will help.2. Exercise.\u00a0\u00a0Try to do some sort of moderate intensity exercise for at least 30 minutes every day.\u00a0\u00a0Ideally do the exercise after eating, to help your body absorb sugar.3. Very low carb (no sugars/ sweetened foods, bread, pasta, potato, rice, corn etc), moderate protein, and enough healthy unprocessed fats to keep you satisfied.\u00a0\u00a0Your carbs should be mainly coming from non-starchy vegetables.\u00a0\u00a0No fruits.4.
