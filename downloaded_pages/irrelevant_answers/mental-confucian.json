            "answer": "Hi,As a neurological cause of the brain fog has been ruled out for you, the reason could be a simple one like Nutritional deficiency, Anemia, Hypoglycemia, Hypotension or\u00a0\u00a0Stress. It seems you have not gone for the routine investigations. Please consult a physician for the same. Please take adequate rest and exercises, eat a well balanced diet and take good sleep at night. Keep yourself away from stress. It may aggravate the symptoms. Hope this helps you. Take care and regards!",

            "answer": "I too have been dealing with the brain fog for the past 5 months. I have been through the work up of blood tests for everything imaginable from Lyme's disease to diabetes with no positive results. I have been through the MRI and have ECGs and EMG tests next week. I have been through 2 ENT doctors and found nothing. To say this is depressing is an understatement. I am 43 and can not work,\u00a0\u00a0can not draw disability. My retirement plan is toast and my wife is busting her but to make the bills.\u00a0\u00a0Even typing this is taking me forever. I question my motives for even attempting to post this and find I just need to tell someone. I find I fill my time reading everything I can get my hands on trying to feel the leaking hole in my mind.",

    "question": "For the past year I have had what I can only assume is brain fog. I have significant trouble processing information, reaching conclusions, thinking abstractly, and recently reading. This has caused me to become apathetic and depressed. I cannot do my homework, and have problems remembering things. I miss extremely obvious things, such as jokes and do not pick up on many things anymore. I literaly feel that I have a fog in my head, and feel like I am behind the world looking at it, with a fog in front of my eyes. I used to be fatigued as well, however I started taking B vitamins and they helped a bit. I took anti-depressants for a while, however while my mood improved the brain fog did not go away. I have come up with several ideas as to what this may be: b-vitamin deficiency, hypoglycemia, diabetes, potassium deficiency, candida overgrowth. I was hoping that someone would be able to provide an idea on what they think this may be. I have been to a neurologist, and gotten an EEG and MRI which were normal. I am taking a blood test soon. I cannot think the way I used to, and find it hard to compete in college. This has impacted my life significantly, and I hope that someone will answer accordingly.",
