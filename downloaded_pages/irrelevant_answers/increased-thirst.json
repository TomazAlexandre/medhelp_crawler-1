            "answer": "In addition to being thirsty, most undiagnosed diabetics complain of fatigue and ravenous hunger. If the person has been diabetic for a long time and has not yet been diagnosed, he will sometimes lose weight even though eating a lot. But the real test is in getting some lab work done and a fasting blood sugar test. It is simple and quick, and will give you a definite answer. Moms usually have good radar when something is wrong with a child, so I would encourage you to look at whether he seems tired, is sleeping a lot, etc. and just ask the doctor to do a checkup if you have any doubts. Better to be safe than sorry.",
