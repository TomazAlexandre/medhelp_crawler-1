            "answer": "Hello Amanda,Welcome to the Pain Mangement Forum. I am sorry that you are experiencing edema in your lower extremities.While diabetes can contribute or cause edema in some ppl it is not the major cause. Some medications such as calcium channel blockers can produce edema. Cardiac problems is one of the most common causes of edema.CHF (Congestive heart failure) or kidney disease can also cause edema. Slight edema is common in post menopausal women, during pregnancy or in over weight ppl.The most concerning to me is that your report that you \"woke up\" with edema. You should contact your PCP today and/or go to Urgent Care. Please let us know how you are doing. I will watch for your updates with interest and concern.Take Care, Tuck",
