            "answer": "Hi,I was intrigued by your \"password trick\", and thought I would try it with my son. I won't be relying on it at this stage, but I thought, since it has worked for you and your dad, it might be a fair \"indicator\" of low bg levels in my son. I spend much of the night, touching him for that sweaty feel to the skin, lifting his limbs or pushing him gently across the bed to test for muscle tone and responses. Since, when he is \"low\" according to a glucometer during sleep, he readily responds to requests to take glucose, jellybeans, etc, presumably he might also respond to a request for the \"password\", despite being asleep, and thus aiding the assessment of his current status.Thanks for the tip. Any others?JJ's mom",

            "answer": "Hi vprrchk,Just to put my two cents in I agree with gg that testing is very important, but what a great idea to have a code word for an intital sign of a low coming on. How very smart. It never cease's to amaze me that no matter how long we have been dealing with diabetes the people posting in this forum can teach us so much with their own experiences. Please keep coming back.Thank you,dm",

    "question": "Hello,This isn't really a question, but a little trick I have learned from my mom.\u00a0\u00a0My dad had been a diabetic since he was 3 years old, zoom some odd number into the future and then he married my mom.\u00a0\u00a0My mom tells me all the time about the things she would have to do for him, rolling over at night and touching his arm to see if he was sweating (a major sign of low bg for him), force him to eat when he was low, among other things.\u00a0\u00a0When I developed diabetes she started thinking that there has to be a better way to see if someone's bg is low while you're out.\u00a0\u00a0So...she came up with a brilliant idea.\u00a0\u00a0What she did was tell both of us a very common word (for us it was \"answering machine\") and that is our \"password.\"\u00a0\u00a0It works every single time!!\u00a0\u00a0All someone has to do that is around is ask \"What's the password?\"\u00a0\u00a0And let me tell you (it's funny when I look at it, but not very funny to her, lol) no matter how hard I or my dad tried, we could not come up with the correct word.\u00a0\u00a0Sometimes I would say \"cell phone\" or \"phone\" or \"fax,\" but never \"answering machine.\"\u00a0\u00a0Anyway, I thought I would pass this along and see if it works for anyone else.~vprrchk",
