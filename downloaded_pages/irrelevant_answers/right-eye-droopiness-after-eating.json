            "answer": "Hello and hope you are doing well.The condition you are referring to is called ptosis (drooping) of the eyelid. The muscle supplying the eyelid becomes weak or there is a defect with the nerve supply, hence the eyelid droops. The nerve pathways can be affected\u00a0\u00a0with infections, certain medications, and injuries. Risk factors include diabetes mellitus, certain diseases affecting the muscles and tumors. This drooping can cause defective vision and sometimes increased tearing. Treatment is basically the underlying cause and corrective surgery for the ptosis is another option. You will need to consult your primary care physician for further evaluation, who may then refer you to an ophthalmologist.Hope this helped and do keep us posted.",

            "answer": "This is a cranial nerve issue. The reason the drooping increases after eating is likely due to the increased glucose levels. Because of osmolysis, there is a movement of fluid into the area surrounding the nerve sheath surrounding the cranial nerve that controls the eyelid. This increases pressure on the nerve and thence, the droop.\u00a0\u00a0It is a hallmark of diabetes and you need to get an hba1c test for a definitive answer.",

            "answer": "Hi Dr Anitha,Thanks for the help. I have been scared\u00a0\u00a0over the idea of having a pituitary or hypothalamic tumor. I am thinking of this because my endocrinologist thought I have some form of complex endocrine disorder. I am awaiting certain blood tests (PTH, calcium, alk phosphatase) and will keep posted.Thanksloki",

            "answer": "Hi caregiver222,Your answer kind of makes sense to me since I have been always an very anxious and nervous person, and that too for no reason (I am not a sad person). I am currently on Xanax and some anti-depressant. My medical problems are being associated to Marfan Syndrome right now, though I do not think it is. Waiting for a genetic testing. Can anxiety and nervousness be connected to cranial nerve problem? I also have tingling in my left foot sometimes, depending on my posture.Another thing is,lately I realized the eye also starts to droop if I havnt ate for like ~2 hours. Also since I am so severly underweight, I was under the impression Diabetes mostly attacks obese people.Thanks a lot for reply.",

I have a marfanoid body with osteopenia in some bones but perfect heart and aorta. Could this be a neurological issue? 6'2'' and 120lb. Diagnosed with gastritis and focal ulcerative colitis few days back.Few weeks back I had a sudden episode of severe \"anxiety attack\" after eating full meal. Had to call 911. So bad :(",
