            "answer": "A good thing to get yr BSL down is balsamic vinegar.I use it all the time on salads as a dressing as my partner is a Diabetic.Ask him to do your FT3 and FT4.He cant dose you on TSH alone as that can be very misleading.As for the diabetes..yes it can cause problems with the thyroid meds.Just dont take the thyroid med at the same time as the diabetes med.If it clashes then change yr thyroid med to night.",

            "answer": "I'm currently taking 500 mg Metformin at night.\u00a0\u00a0I take my thyroid medication in the morning, so they shouldn't even be passing each other in the \"corridor.\"\u00a0\u00a0I'm truly hoping I don't need to increase the Metformin as I have had gastro problems for many years, and don't want to add to those issues with a higher dose of Metformin.",

            "answer": "Have you tried any other diabetes meds?My partner is on Metformin and is in the process as we speak of trying another medication as Metformin (Diabex) was great to start with but now a year later , his BSL levels have gone up too.He originally lost 9kgs in weight when he first started on it but since then has just come to a standstill and his levels are getting no better or worse either.He does need to bring his down a bit more and lose a bit more weight but its just not happening...so think the bodys got used to the Metformin and time to try another Diabetic medication....Worth thinking about.",
