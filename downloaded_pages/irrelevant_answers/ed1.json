            "answer": "Yes there is something you can do about ED---Find a clinic that uses a vasodialtor medication that you use to inject yourself into the penis that can cause the blood to flow into the penis and get erect--within minutes.\u00a0\u00a0One on the drugs used is PGE and just causes the penis to get full of blood.\u00a0\u00a0When the medication is metabolized the erection subsides.I know it sounds crazy but I have injected over\u00a0\u00a0a hundred patients and have had very good results.I use a very fine 31 guage needle and the patient hardly knows it---and they do it to themselves with great results.You can ask a urologist if he offers this in his practice or can refer you to someone that does cavernosal injection therapy.\u00a0\u00a0Read about PGE.Hope this helps--David",
