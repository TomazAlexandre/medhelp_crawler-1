            "answer": "Heart failure would likely present with both feet swollen.Anyway, I think his doctor should take a look at this, to rule out infections and more important, blood clots. This is easily done with the \"D-dimer\" blood test. Most medical centres will have the answer ready within 15 minutes. Infections can be ruled out with a CRP test or a counting of white blood cells.I hope he will be OK. Good luck!",

            "answer": "I agree that this needs to be looked at. It could be something so simple as edema or fluid build up especially if you press on the area and the area you pressed on with your fingers leaves a dent for a few moments that generally points to edema but you want to make sure w. his history that it is not heart related.\u00a0\u00a0In the interim you want to make sure that he elevates is leg that is effected and make sure that he isn't wearing anything tight around the affected area like socks, tight shoes, etc especially if when he takes his socks off they leave indentations on the area.\u00a0\u00a0The thing is is that it could be something so simple you wouldn't believe it like being on his feet too long, or too much salt intake, or hot weather....but only a doc can make that call.\u00a0\u00a0The rules of engagement for clots are \"red....hot.....swollen...painful\" you never ever want to rub out an area that those 4 things are present in case it is a clot because you can cause it to break up and shot clots thru your system which would be terrible.\u00a0\u00a0Make the five minute call and call the heart doc because if it is edema or water build up you two need to find out where it is coming from and it is super easy to fix....let us know okay?",

            "answer": "I, too, have a heart condition - CHF (congestive heart failure) - plus diabetes and am living with one fat foot.\u00a0\u00a0I had all the tests.\u00a0\u00a0The podiatrist concluded that I have venous insufficiency - that is, blood travels down to the foot but cannot quite make it back up.\u00a0\u00a0I have to wear a knit \"sleeve\" on that foot and prop it up twice a day with an ice pack for an indefinite period.\u00a0\u00a0This seems to suggest that the condition is self-correcting, which I doubt.I am also interested in hearing your boyfriend's diagnosis.",
