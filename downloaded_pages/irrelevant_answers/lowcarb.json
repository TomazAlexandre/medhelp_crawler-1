            "answer": "Depending on many factors, your highest carb and calorie intake can vary. Do you want to lose weight? Do you want to maintain? How are your sugars currently? Are you on medication? Are you being treated for heart disease?For me, I try and maintaIn my weight loss (I have lost 100 pounds over the last 2 years), so I keep my top calorie amount at 2,000. This is made up of heart healthy foods like whole grains, and legumes, as well as low glycemic index foods as suggested above. Ex. Instead of jasmine rise which would impact my glucose in the same manner if not worse than straight sugar, I use a lower glycemic rice-basmati-so as to not raise my BG so high.I also have adjusted my carb amounts to match how my sugars rise and fall throughout the day due to my natural body rhythm. Many folks find this to be helpful to them. The only way for YOU to know how YOUR sugars are affected is to test around your own foods. I have 45g for breakfast, 30 for lunch, and 60g for dinner. I have a mid-afternoon snack that I keep 15g or under.Some folks find they can tolerate a higher carb amount, while others find a lower amount works best for you. The only way to determine how high you can go, is to check your response to the amount. Keep a log, and find patterns.",
