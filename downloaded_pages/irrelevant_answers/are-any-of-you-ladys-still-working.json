            "answer": "I was working up until 14w or so. I felt the same thing at work, before I got pregnant I transferred to the meat department and was doing really well, but early in my pregnancy I was sick all the time and extremely tired. I couldn't keep up\u00a0\u00a0and my male supervisor said he knew exactly how I felt because he has diabetes. Then they wouldn't work with me to coordinate my child care for my older daughter. So, after all that, I quit. Luckily, where I'm living I qualified for unemployment benefits and then even luckier my husband got a new job where we can actually afford the time at home.But if I were you, I'd check with your unemployment offices to see if you'd qualify if you had to quit. Bring it up with management how you feel about the work you're doing and even hr. There's absolutely no reason you should feel harassed. That's unacceptable if you ask me.",
