Avoid apple juice as it is full of sugar and has very little nutritional value when compared to other juices. Also avoid orange juice as it is way too acidic for them.Other food to avoid until they are at least 1 year old (avoid peanuts longer if history of food allergies in family):Honeyegg whitesMilkPeanuts/Peanut ButterThese have a high incedence of allergic reactions (honey can harbor botulism as it is not pasturized) and it is recommended that you avoid feeding these foods until your child is at least 1 year old.In my own personal opinion, I never gave my son Kool-Aid, soda, sugary juices or any of that stuff when he was that young. Even at the age of 31 months, he still only gets a few ounces of caffeine free soda on special occasions and has yet to even taste Kool-Aid.Andrea",

LOL\u00a0\u00a0I just thought it was gross myself as a child so I never subjected her to it.But on another note, I read somewhere (in a time long ago and long forgotten) that the dyes in some foods and drinks can be harful, (again long ago, so I can't remember why or how). But I do remember that Kool-Aid was specifically mentioned, especially red Kool-Aid.Do any of you think Crystal Light is any better? I usually make that for DD and I to drink. She gets one cup of that a day, one cup of juice and the rest of the day it's milk and water. Just looking for an opinion on teh Crystal Light though. Or is you have a better suggestion. Oh and sometimes I do watered down gatorade for the both of us too. But then I read the other day how bad that is! LOL I swear there is nothing we can drink or eat anymore that won't kill us!",

My son is a huge water drinker, he drinks tons of water throughout the day. Juice is fine in moderation, diluted is even better. Milk is good, but avoid giving it with iron rich foods as calcium interferes with the absorption of iron and can lead to anemia. A close friends little boy was just diagnosed as being anemic and he would honestly have been the last kid I would have ever expected! He is a huge meat eater and has a great appetite. I then started asking her about his milk consumption and quickly discovered why his iron is so low, his dad gives him milk with every meal!Andrea",
