    "question": "Hi,My daughter who is two, was eating a melon and some strawberries when all of a sudden she started waving her arms in the air in a circle, then her pupils enlarged, you couldn't even see her eye color.\u00a0\u00a0I grabbed her and held her, she said she was dizzy and couldn't see.\u00a0\u00a0She looked as if she could see through me.\u00a0\u00a0A few minutes later she was fine.\u00a0\u00a0We put it down to brain freeze and possible stawberry allergies.A few weeks later, she had just eaten lunch, veggies soup.\u00a0\u00a0Went to sit on the sofa to eat a marshmallow and jumped up saying she was dizzy, then fell over to the ground on her left side.\u00a0\u00a0When my husband picked her up she was so hard and stiff and was scared to walk.Went to the ER and they did blood test and took urine, which ruled out diabetes and blood count was good.\u00a0\u00a0The doc said he thought she was holding her breath, which is common for her age.\u00a0\u00a0I know it wasn't that.Her Uncle is an epileptic , although family doc said it's not that.\u00a0\u00a0He also doesn't think it's realted to the strawberries.\u00a0\u00a0So what could it be?\u00a0\u00a0She talks through the episodes and it lasts for only a minute.\u00a0\u00a0She has tubes in her ears, only one left in, which she received when she was eight months old.\u00a0\u00a0She was born 8 days early and had yellow jaundice.\u00a0\u00a0Aside from that, the odd cold, sinus infection this year and strep she's healthy.The only other change is in her sleeping habits, she was the best sleeper and now either won't go to sleep or wakes at night for two hours.\u00a0\u00a0Not always crying, but she will attempt to sleep and then justs pops up and out of the bed.\u00a0\u00a0She could do this 20 times.\u00a0\u00a0She never sleeps in our bed (only because she doesn't actually go to sleep in it) and she eats a very healthy diet.Have to wait a\u00a0\u00a0few weeks for the pediatricians appointment, but it's got me scared as to what it may be.\u00a0\u00a0I had hep when I was younger, could I have given this too her?If anyone can help, I would be so grateful.Happy New Year to you all.Lydia",
