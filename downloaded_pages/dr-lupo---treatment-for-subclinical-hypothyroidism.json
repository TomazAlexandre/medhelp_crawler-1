            "answer": "Hi Renee,I am 47 and for 21/2 years have had intermittant symptoms as you mentioned above. It seemed it would last for weeks to months and then get better, but always tired.\u00a0\u00a0My TSH's were simuliar to yours.\u00a0\u00a0I went to an \"older\" endo who ignored the TSH's and read then as normal.\u00a0\u00a0He suggested I go to Mayo Clinic.\u00a0\u00a0After that I found an article posted by the American Association of Clinical Endocrinolgist which recommends that a TSH > 3.03 be evaluated for treatment and that each case should be individualized but certainly if there are symptoms you could benefit.\u00a0\u00a0That was in December.\u00a0\u00a0I took this info to my family practice who started me on 25mcg synthyroid.\u00a0\u00a0After 8 weeks I was back to my old self and very excited.\u00a0\u00a0Unfortunately now in April I have started having some of the same symptoms, but not near as bad.\u00a0\u00a0I do feel hormones are the culprit.\u00a0\u00a0But probabIy a combination of thyroid and adrenal.\u00a0\u00a0I hope this helps you in getting prepared for your visit.\u00a0\u00a0You may meet resistance, but don't give up. Somethings are standard but others differ from one physician to another and you have to just find the right physican for you.\u00a0\u00a0Good luck and please post what kind of response you get from him.\u00a0\u00a0 Also see these sites:http://www.aace.com/newsroom/press/2003/index.php?r=20030118and\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 http://thyroid.about.com/cs/testsforthyroid/a/labs2003.htmHope this helps,\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0Judy",
