    "question": "Hi I'm here once again and yesterday I got my blood results back and my a1c went up to 6.5 it's been up and down for 3 years now first 6.2,6.3,6.2,6.4 and now 6.5, I know An A1C level of 6.5 percent or higher on two separate tests indicates you have diabetes but I want to know do I still have time to lower it with dieting and excerise by my next follow up in June to avoid a confirmation of diabetes. I messaged my doctor and told him do I still have time to lower it before I'm diagnosed with diabetes and if I should come in sooner and he said just lose weight and no need to come in sooner . I'm guessing he's not to worried but I am . Please help and thank you for your answers",
