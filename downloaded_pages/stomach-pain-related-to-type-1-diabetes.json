            "answer": "Did you take her blood sugar when she was having the stomach aches? I guess I am just wondering if you discovered a pattern.\u00a0\u00a0Maybe if you made a chart of when she gets the stomach aches and documented what she ate or activities she does on those days you might see a pattern and maybe be able to figure out if something triggers the lows or highs and stomach aches.\u00a0\u00a0I do know that I have patterns myself--mostly due to hormones-like when I am ovulating my blood sugars rise and I must compensate with more insulin.\u00a0\u00a0 I know she is probably too young for that but now that I know what triggers my highs I can compensate and make my life easier.",

            "answer": "My 7 year old DD is doing the same thing. We get stomach complaints almost everyday. I have tried to find a pattern, but cannot. The pain she complains of is different than when her sugar is high and she has stomach pain. She is not constipated, but does sometimes complain of diarrhea. We followed all the foods she has eaten when it happens and nothing. We had the pediatrician run Thyroid and Celiac screenings and both were negative. We are taking her tomorrow to the gastro doctor just to be safe, but it is really bothering us. I hope we can get some answers.",

I'm coping well with everything, including the injections, however when I actually inject the insulin it stings/burns. The actual pain of the needle prick is bearable but this burning sensation is not. Does this sound familiar to anyone? Anyway, back to the abdominal pain. It started about 3 days ago and although it is a constant 'severe hunger' sensation I get bursts/spasms of excruciating pain every hour or so. I returned to hospital and the doctor found that the glands in my neck were severely swelled and that I had trapped gas and knotting of intestines. He explained that these symptoms gave him the impression of a stomach bug/viral infection. 3 hours ago I gratefully swallowed two Buscopan tablets and although it took a while to kick in, the pain is finally easing.",

She also complains of stomache pains.Reading these posts, and seeing some suggestions (Which we will try). I was thinking that maybe these pains might be a affect of the injections themselves (albeit maybe harmless).A bit like when someone sleeps in a draft and wakes up with a stiff neck. Or someone who is constantly in an uncomfortable postion, then complains of aches and pain. I myself suffer from shoulder pain, which was do not keeping my shoulders relaxed (Took a physiotherapist to spot that. lol).It was this that made me think that the pains may be a result of the nearby muscles or organs having to adjust to the repeated injections.I have noticed that our little girls stomach looks like an upside down shelf, from all the injections.When our little girl has her injection, she has a choice of areas to have the injection, though she favours the stomache usually.This is just a thought.",

            "answer": "I am reading all your comments and i must say what i found and think. My 20 year old son was diagnosed with type1 D almost a year and a half ago. I remember that before his diagnosis he was complaining of stomach pains on and off. He has been on insulin for a month after the diagnosis and then he started having lows all the time so we decided to stop the insulin. That was almost\u00a0\u00a01.5 years ago. His sugar readings were normal. Now he started having the pains again and his sugar is high again. So i think this is definitely related to the high sugar. Something in the stomach triggers something off and causes the sugars to go up. Im not a doctor but i think this should be looked into by some professionals. Obviously there is a pattern. Your body is giving you signs that something is going on that is not right. I'm shocked that doctors dont even bother to relate one thing to another instead they eliminate unrelated things like gas etc.\u00a0\u00a0I hope all of us here with sick children with this disease will somehow try to connect the dots and maybe someone will hear.",
