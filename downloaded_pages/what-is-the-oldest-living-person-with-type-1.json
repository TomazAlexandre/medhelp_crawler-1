Some folks who take excellent care of their glucose numbers get complications, while some who are more lax don't. However, studies have proven that tight control DOES help prevent complications no matter whether you are one of the \"lucky\" ones or not.",

I was misdiagnosed at that time as Type II but was recently confirmed to be Type 1.5/LADA. LADA is more like Type I than Type II. They believe 15% of Type 2's are misdiagnosed because they are older so people assume they are Type II. Yep, docs don't know everything!I also go to the website *********.com and a man there who has been T1 for 63 stories has a syndicated story on the site of his life and management of diabetes that is quite interesting. I feel lucky that if I had to get this disease I got it today when there is so much more understanding of how to manage it. Great thread!Zoe",
