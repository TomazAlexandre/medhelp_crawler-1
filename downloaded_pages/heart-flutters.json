            "answer": "My daughter went to a heart Dr. and he said that she has an aneurysm in the septum of her\u00a0\u00a0heart but told her not to worry about it. I thought an aneurysm could blow at anytime. As her mother I am very worried and she has a husband and 2 young daughters. Should I be worried and should we get a second opinion. I would feel better if she got a second opinion.Thanks!",

            "answer": "I am 25 and have the same fluttering sensation in my chest. Left side to be exact. I have had several tests and all say I am fine. I do have higher than normal stress, but I feel that is a terriable answer. It is a cheap easy way for doctors. I know I am in my last year of Pre-Med starting med school very soon. Though I do not know the full answer yet I intend on finding out why. I hope a mixture of curiosity and knowledge will allow me to better answer this problem. Also does anyone else that has it localized over the left side also have slight spasm in the left arm before or after the flutter?",
