    "question": "First off... Hi everyone and thanks for making such a great site! My aunt's doctor gave her Budeprion SR 150 mg to help quit smoking. A friend of her's told her that you're not supposed to take it, if you take any medications for diabetes. She does take a pill (not sure which and didn't think to ask her) for her diabetes and I told her I'd try to find out if it could cause any problems. I did a little online research and I've found that you're supposed to tell your doctor if you do take any medications for diabetes, but it doesn't say that you aren't supposed to take it. So, my question is... Is this safe to take with her diabetes medication and did her doctor not make sure this was safe for her? If there only certain diabetes medications that she can't take with this, could someone tell me which ones those are, so I can tell her if it's safe or not? Thanks in advance for all the help!",
