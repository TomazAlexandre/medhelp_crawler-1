Do you think I need hiv testing after this incident?No, I see no medical need for testing.2. Do you think that her diabetes blood sugar would be affected by ARS?No, I would not.3. Should I just move on from this situation?that would be my advice.I hope these comments are helpful.\u00a0\u00a0Please do not worry. EWH",

            "answer": "THanks doctor. I appreciate your quick response. I believe that I might just be hypersensitive to all symptoms whether large or small. I have read numerous threads on here explaining how safe condom protected sex is. I have never had a std and this is a new experience for me. I started to question whether or not the condom started to slip up my penis or other ridiculous events. However, I filled the condom with water after to look for leaks.....nothing. I was afraid that the condom just didn't work appropriately. I know it is just anxiety speaking. Thank you for all you guys do. THis forum is extremely helpful.",

    "question": "Doctors,Recently I have made a major mistake that I am completely regretting. I met a woman at a bar, who was known to be promiscuous. We ended up having vaginal sex. I wore a condom from start to finish and it did not break because I removed the condom myself and noticed that it was not broken. I realize that I am probably worrying needlessly, but it has really consumed my mind. I am in a long term relationship with a girl that I love and I am completely hurt over my decision. I have since returned to our normal unprotected sex, but ever since the incident, her blood sugars have been a bit higher at night. She is type 1 diabetic. I know this probably has nothing to do with it, but it freaks me out. I would really appreciate some reassurance or expert advice. I have had no fever or sore throat. The only symptom or medical concern I had was I felt a bit fatigued for 2 days, but not fully sick. I also had a mouth infection next to an abscess tooth.1. Do you think I need hiv testing after this incident?2. Do you think that her diabetes blood sugar would be affected by ARS?3. Should I just move on from this situation?",
