    "question": "HIFOR THE PAST 4 YEARS I SEE TINY (OR EVEN MICRO) DOTS ON VISION ESPECIALLY NIGHT ONE. IT IS LIKE VIEWING A TV RASTER SCREEN (NO STATION TUNED ON..BUT MICRO DOTS) OR LIKE NIGHT CAMERA SCENES TAKEN BY INFRA RED CAMERAS. IT IS LIKE \"NOISE\" ON VIEWED SCENE AS IF YOU WERE WATCHING POOR CONVENTIONAL ANALOGUE RECEPTION ON OLD TVs. I SEE THESE DOTS EVEN IF I COMPLETELY COVER MY EYES; I DON'T SEE PURE BLACK BUT RATHER \"NOISY\" BLACK. I'M 45 YEARS OLD. IN PERFECT HEALTH..NO DIABETES..NOTHING;I MADE ALL TESTS RECENTLY. I WENT TO SEE TWO DOCTORS ..THEY SAID MY EYES ARE OK. COULD IT BE EYE NERVE IS PRODUCING THIS \"NOISE\". I HAVE TINNITUS (HISS NOISE AT THE CENTRE OF MY BRAIN). I'M NOT SENSITIVE TO LIGHT. VISION IS SHARP .CAN SOMEONE HELP WITH THIS?.",
