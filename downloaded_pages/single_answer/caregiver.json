    "question": "My 5 year old daughter was just diagnosed with type 1 diabetes. Her daycare provider is now afraid to take care of her. I was wondering if there are any programs in the state of California that would allow me to be a paid caregiver? I am a single mother of 2 children and would just like to keep my part time job and quit my full time job without going into too much debt. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.",
