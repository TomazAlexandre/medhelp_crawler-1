            "answer": "Hi Tony!Well if no cysts, tumors, nodules etc were found then chances of cancer are less. A generalized liver enlargement can be due to heart related causes, autoimmune hepatitis, viral hepatitis (usually liver enzymes are raised), side effect of medications, metabolic syndromes like diabetes, or due to thrombosis of blood vessels in liver. Please consult your doctor regarding this. Hope this helps. Take care!The medical advice given should not be considered a substitute for medical care provided by a doctor who can examine you. The advice may not be completely correct for you as the doctor cannot examine you and does not know your complete medical history. Hence this reply to your post should only be considered as a guiding line and you must consult your doctor at the earliest for your medical problem.",
