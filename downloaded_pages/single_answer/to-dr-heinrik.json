            "answer": "Hi,For disease that has recurred and is amenable to surgical removal, there are patients who may benefit from this. If the disease doesn\u2019t seem to be removable, then there are drug treatments available. There are 3 well-studied regimens, the selection of which would depend on how high-risk the disease is estimated to be. Some of these are orally given, some through the blood, some are given under the skin (such as some drugs for diabetes). Discuss the options with a doctor. If a team of doctors is involved, discuss all options so as to make sure that all the options are discussed adequately. Stay positive.",
