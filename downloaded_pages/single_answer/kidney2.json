            "answer": "Hi,Actually, I have not understood the exact meaning of your problem.If you mean leaking of urine, then probably you are suffering urinary incontinence and I\u2019ll suggest you to consult a urologist as you might need further tests to find out the cause and treatment for the same. In this condition, the sphincters of the urinary bladder or urethra become weak resulting in the leakage of urine.The other possibility is excessive passage of urine which can happen in diabetes mellitus. I\u2019ll suggest you to get your blood sugar done and maybe some other tests like urine specific gravity, kidney functions tests etc.I hope that helps. Take care and pls do keep me posted on how you are doing or if you have any additional doubts. Kind regards.",
