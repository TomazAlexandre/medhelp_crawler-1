    "question": "Hi everyone, it's probably a silly question but it seems to pop up on conversation regularly. I'm 23 weeks pregnant and am becoming increasingly worried about growing too big. My husband is 6'8 and well built, I am 5'6 also with a bigger build and diet controlled diabetes. I have only put on 2 kilos since getting pregnant and my fundal height is approx 26cm. The doctor I saw last agreed I was bigger than I should be but I wonder if there is anything I can do about it. I have eaten healthy and followed all the rules to the best of my ability. I really want to avoid a c-section.",
