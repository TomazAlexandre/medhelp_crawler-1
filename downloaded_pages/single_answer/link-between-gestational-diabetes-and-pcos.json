            "answer": "I ahve been diagnosed with pcos and that was after I had both of my children. I passed my glucose test both times and never had a problem. They also say that even if you don't have GD you may still not process sugar properly and the baby can be quite large. I had an aversion to sugar most of my pregnancies so my babies were both 7 pounds. I would advise to just eat as healthy as you can and anything that happens is out of your control. Good Luck I hope you pass.",
