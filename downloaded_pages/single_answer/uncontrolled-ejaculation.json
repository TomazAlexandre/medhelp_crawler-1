            "answer": "Hi there!It is not normal but may be seen in cases of extreme stress/ psychological issues especially when compounded with other factors such as depression, neurogenic disorders peyronie's disease, body image issues, medications, alcohol, smoking, drugs/medications, hormonal imbalance, radiation therapy, kidney failure, metabolic disorders, multiple sclerosis, hypertension, diabetes, prostatitis, urethritis etc. At a primary level I would suggest being a bit relaxed about the situation and see if this seems to improve the condition. If you do not notice any improvement, it might be a good idea to consult a urologist for a detailed evaluation and appropriate management.Hope this helps.Take care!",
