    "question": "I'm a 21 year old male who is pretty active and athletic.This morning, I discovered, slightly darker than normal, rough, borderline crusty, dead looking skin on my big toe, and second toe on my right foot. this skin has sort of dark dots in it, but not many. It does not itch or hurt.I have experienced toe numbness before(when my house is chilly, or when I stand for a long time), I am not sure if these are related. Does this sound like any symptom of diabetes?I am not educated when it comes to diabetes. Does this sound like anything? By the way, the skin is like this on the TIP of my toes.Thanks for your time.",
