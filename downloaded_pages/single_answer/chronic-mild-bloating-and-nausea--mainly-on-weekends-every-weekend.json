            "answer": "Hi, understand your predicament. If all the investigations done have ruled out an organic cause for your symptoms, I suggest you develop good style measures to promote your appetite and health. Sometimes the proton pump inhibitors or the medications themselves can cause a loss of appetite or nausea. So, try to wean yourself of medications, eat healthy balanced meals. Try to get organic products. Make fresh appetizing food. Exercise regularly and go for long stress free walks; this promotes appetite and keeps you healthy. Regards.",

    "question": "I'm a 30 year old male. For the last few years, I've started to experience a recurring issue on weekends or days off where I feel mildly nauseous and bloated for most of the day, sometimes accompanied by acid reflux. It feels like my meals just sit in my stomach for hours and hours. I have thrown up meals 6 hours after eating them before, although I haven't actually thrown up from this in over a year. For whatever reason, I do not experience these symptoms when I get up early and go to work, but any day where I don't get up early and have things to do all day long I have these symptoms for most of the day.Since I was 15, I've experienced infrequent but recurring very painful heartburn, usually several times a month for 2-3 days. I've been on 40mg pantaloc for the last 5 years because of this, and that makes the heartburn less frequent and less severe when I get it. The timing of when I get heartburn is much more random that when I get the nausea symptoms, and appears to be uncorrelated to the nausea, at least in timings of the symptoms.My family doctor and the GI specialist I've seen don't have any ideas. I have been diagnosed with a mild hiatal hernia but that's all. Here's a run down of the tests I've done:Gastric Emptying study - Normal (although that was a symptom free day)Upper GI ultrasound (twice) - NormalBarium Swallow - Discovered mild hiatal herniaH. Pylori test (3 times) - NegativeCeliac - NegativeDiabetes - NegativeI've had lots of other blood tests that I might have forgotten so just ask if it's seems pertinent.I have tried to adjust my lifestyle to accommodate the symptoms, and it's helped but not a lot. I've tried getting up early on weekends (8am) and eating breakfast right away usually helps a bit. I don't see this relating to alcohol since I often go weeks without having a drink. I do drink 3-4 cups of coffee a day.Any suggestions or thoughts?",
