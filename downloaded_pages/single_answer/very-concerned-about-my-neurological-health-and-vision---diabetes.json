            "answer": "I agree with the brain imaging thus far.\u00a0\u00a0A negative test would rule out many of the major neurological disorders.If diabetes is a concern, blood tests should be done to evaluate the glucose level.Going back to the fainting spells, I would also image the carotid arteries to rule out blockages.If negative, cardiac disease can also lead to the symptoms.\u00a0\u00a0An echocardiogram and Holter monitor should be considered to evaluate for structural and rhythmic causes.These options can be discussed in conjunction with your neurologist or cardiologist.\u00a0\u00a0I agree with the neuro-ophthalmologist evaluation as well.These options can be discussed with your personal physician.Followup with your personal physician is essential.This answer is not intended as and does not substitute for medical advice - the information presented is for patient education only.

    "question": "Good Morning,I am a 33 year old Male. 5'6 275 lbs. I recognize I am overweight. I was diagnosed with panic disorder last October. I have had about 5 panic attacks since then. I was perscribed SSRI's that did not work. (too many side effects). One of my panic attacks was so bad that I felt it necessary to call 911. I currrently have klonopin and Zanex for an as needed type of situation.Since then, I have developed what I call \"Brain Drops\"...where I will be driving along on the road and suddenly feel like I am going to faint, etc. Lasts about 1 sec... When this happens I usually have to pull over and take a zanex and a bottled water then I feel better. But I can have up to 3 of these a day..Quite annoying.My most recent symptoms inlude ringing in my ears, numbness in my face (That frost bite type feeling that lasts for hours)...and lightheadedness....A lot of this seems to happen a lot when I am working at my laptop, work computer...I currently have an appointment with a Neuro-optomologist due to a vision field defect that i was discovered my optomitrist.The numbness and lightheadedness got so bad yesterday I had to leave work. Went to the hospital...They have ordered more blood tests...that is where I stand currently..CT SCAN BRAIN : OKMRI BRAIN SCAN : OKCHEST X-RAY: OKIs there something I need to look at here that I am missing? I am concerned I might be diabetic as it runs in my family. I also am concerned that there might be a problem with my eyes causing these faint spells...Looking forward to a response. This has been going on for six months now. Should I be headed to the ER? What measure can I take to insure I am on the right path here?",
